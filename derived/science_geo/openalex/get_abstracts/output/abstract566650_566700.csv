https://openalex.org/W2514448720,"Howard Chang, Ravindra Majeti and colleagues define the chromatin accessibility and transcriptional landscapes in 13 human primary blood cell types and in acute myeloid leukemia cells. They identify potential regulators governing hematopoietic differentiation and genetic elements linked to regulatory evolution in cancer cells. We define the chromatin accessibility and transcriptional landscapes in 13 human primary blood cell types that span the hematopoietic hierarchy. Exploiting the finding that the enhancer landscape better reflects cell identity than mRNA levels, we enable 'enhancer cytometry' for enumeration of pure cell types from complex populations. We identify regulators governing hematopoietic differentiation and further show the lineage ontogeny of genetic elements linked to diverse human diseases. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chromatin accessibility uncovers unique regulatory evolution in cancer cells with a progressively increasing mutation burden. Single AML cells exhibit distinctive mixed regulome profiles corresponding to disparate developmental stages. A method to account for this regulatory heterogeneity identified cancer-specific deviations and implicated HOX factors as key regulators of preleukemic hematopoietic stem cell characteristics. Thus, regulome dynamics can provide diverse insights into hematopoietic development and disease."

In this study, we developed a highly multiplexed single-nucleus sequencing method to investigate copy number evolution in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. We sequenced 1,000 single cells from tumors in 12 patients and identified 1-3 major clonal subpopulations in each tumor that shared a common evolutionary lineage. For each tumor, we also identified a minor subpopulation of non-clonal cells that were classified as metastable, pseudodiploid or chromazemic. Phylogenetic analysis and mathematical modeling suggest that these data are unlikely to be explained by the gradual accumulation of copy number events over time. In contrast, our data challenge the paradigm of gradual evolution, showing that the majority of copy number aberrations are acquired at the earliest stages of tumor evolution, in short punctuated bursts, followed by stable clonal expansions that form the tumor mass."

https://openalex.org/W2516249919,"Mutations in PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) cause early onset familial Parkinson's disease (PD). PINK1 accumulates on the outer membrane of damaged mitochondria followed by recruiting parkin to promote mitophagy. Here, we demonstrate that BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), a mitochondrial BH3-only protein, interacts with PINK1 to promote the accumulation of full-length PINK1 on the outer membrane of mitochondria, which facilitates parkin recruitment and PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy. Inactivation of BNIP3 in mammalian cells promotes PINK1 proteolytic processing and suppresses PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy. Hypoxia-induced BNIP3 expression results in increased expression of full-length PINK1 and mitophagy. Consistently, expression of BNIP3 in Drosophila suppresses muscle degeneration and the mitochondrial abnormality caused by PINK1 inactivation. Together, the results suggest that BNIP3 plays a vital role in regulating PINK1 mitochondrial outer membrane localization, the proteolytic process of PINK1 and PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy under physiological conditions. Functional up-regulation of BNIP3 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to suppress the progression of PD."

https://openalex.org/W2507509177,"Nitrogen availability is crucial for crop yield with nitrogen fertilizer accounting for a large percentage of farmers' expenses. However, an untimely or excessive application of fertilizer can increase risks of negative environmental effects. These factors, along with the environmental and energy costs of synthesizing nitrogen fertilizer, led us to seek out novel biotechnology-driven approaches to supply nitrogen to plants. The strategy we focused on involves transgenic expression of nitrogenase, a bacterial multi-subunit enzyme that can capture atmospheric nitrogen. Here we report expression of the active Fe subunit of nitrogenase via integration into the tobacco plastid genome of bacterial gene sequences modified for expression in plastid. Our study suggests that it will be possible to engineer plants that are able to produce their own nitrogen fertilizer by expressing nitrogenase genes in plant plastids."
https://openalex.org/W2524252492,"The yeast Set2 histone methyltransferase is a critical enzyme that plays a number of key roles in gene transcription and DNA repair. Recently, the human homologue, SETD2, was found to be recurrently mutated in a significant percentage of renal cell carcinomas, raising the possibility that the activity of SETD2 is tumor-suppressive. Using budding yeast and human cell line model systems, we examined the functional significance of two evolutionarily conserved residues in SETD2 that are recurrently mutated in human cancers. Whereas one of these mutations (R2510H), located in the Set2 Rpb1 interaction domain, did not result in an observable defect in SETD2 enzymatic function, a second mutation in the catalytic domain of this enzyme (R1625C) resulted in a complete loss of histone H3 Lys-36 trimethylation (H3K36me3). This mutant showed unchanged thermal stability as compared with the wild type protein but diminished binding to the histone H3 tail. Surprisingly, mutation of the conserved residue in Set2 (R195C) similarly resulted in a complete loss of H3K36me3 but did not affect dimethylated histone H3 Lys-36 (H3K36me2) or functions associated with H3K36me2 in yeast. Collectively, these data imply a critical role for Arg-1625 in maintaining the protein interaction with H3 and specific H3K36me3 function of this enzyme, which is conserved from yeast to humans. They also may provide a refined biochemical explanation for how H3K36me3 loss leads to genomic instability and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2515998503,"Knowledge products comprise assessments of authoritative information supported by standards, governance, quality control, data, tools, and capacity building mechanisms. Considerable resources are dedicated to developing and maintaining knowledge products for biodiversity conservation, and they are widely used to inform policy and advise decision makers and practitioners. However, the financial cost of delivering this information is largely undocumented. We evaluated the costs and funding sources for developing and maintaining four global biodiversity and conservation knowledge products: The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, Protected Planet, and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas. These are secondary data sets, built on primary data collected by extensive networks of expert contributors worldwide. We estimate that US$160 million (range: US$116–204 million), plus 293 person-years of volunteer time (range: 278–308 person-years) valued at US$ 14 million (range US$12–16 million), were invested in these four knowledge products between 1979 and 2013. More than half of this financing was provided through philanthropy, and nearly three-quarters was spent on personnel costs. The estimated annual cost of maintaining data and platforms for three of these knowledge products (excluding the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems for which annual costs were not possible to estimate for 2013) is US$6.5 million in total (range: US$6.2–6.7 million). We estimated that an additional US$114 million will be needed to reach pre-defined baselines of data coverage for all the four knowledge products, and that once achieved, annual maintenance costs will be approximately US$12 million. These costs are much lower than those to maintain many other, similarly important, global knowledge products. Ensuring that biodiversity and conservation knowledge products are sufficiently up to date, comprehensive and accurate is fundamental to inform decision-making for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. Thus, the development and implementation of plans for sustainable long-term financing for them is critical."
https://openalex.org/W2521081942,"Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) often have aggregated α-synuclein (aSyn) in enteric nervous system (ENS) neurons, which may be associated with the development of constipation. This occurs well before the onset of classic PD motor symptoms. We previously found that aging A53T transgenic (Tg) mice closely model PD-like ENS aSyn pathology, making them appropriate for testing potential PD therapies. Here we show that Tg mice overexpressing mutant human aSyn develop ENS pathology by 4 months. We then evaluated the responses of Tg mice and their WT littermates to the Food and Drug Administration-approved drug FTY720 (fingolimod, Gilenya) or vehicle control solution from 5 months of age. Long term oral FTY720 in Tg mice reduced ENS aSyn aggregation and constipation, enhanced gut motility, and increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) but produced no significant change in WT littermates. A role for BDNF was directly assessed in a cohort of young A53T mice given vehicle, FTY720, the Trk-B receptor inhibitor ANA-12, or FTY720 + ANA-12 from 1 to 4 months of age. ANA-12-treated Tg mice developed more gut aSyn aggregation as well as constipation, whereas FTY720-treated Tg mice had reduced aSyn aggregation and less constipation, occurring in part by increasing both pro-BDNF and mature BDNF levels. The data from young and old Tg mice revealed FTY720-associated neuroprotection and reduced aSyn pathology, suggesting that FTY720 may also benefit PD patients and others with synucleinopathy. Another finding was a loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in gut neurons with aggregated aSyn, comparable with our prior findings in the CNS.

https://openalex.org/W2507254852,"MicroRNAs (miRs) regulate inflammation and BMP antagonists, thus they have potential uses as therapeutic reagents. However, the molecular function of miR-200c in modulating proinflammatory and bone metabolic mediators and osteogenic differentiation is not known. After miR-200c was transduced into a human embryonic palatal mesenchyme (HEPM) (a cell line of preosteoblasts), using lentiviral vectors, the resulting miR-200c overexpression increased osteogenic differentiation biomarkers, including osteocalcin (OCN) transcripts and calcium content. miR-200c expression also down-regulated interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)-5 under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and increased osteoprotegerin (OPG) in these cells. miR-200c directly regulates the expression of IL-6, IL-8 and CCL-5 transcripts by binding to their 3'UTRs. A plasmid-based miR-200c inhibitor effectively reduces their binding activities. Additionally, miR-200c delivered using polyethylenimine (PEI) nanoparticles effectively inhibits IL-6, IL-8 and CCL-5 in primary human periodontal ligament fibroblasts and increases the biomarkers of osteogenic differentiation in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including calcium content, ALP, and Runx2. These data demonstrate that miR-200c represses IL-6, IL-8 and CCL-5 and improves osteogenic differentiation. miR-200c may potentially be used as an effective means to prevent periodontitis-associated bone loss by arresting inflammation and osteoclastogenesis and enhancing bone regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2514359199,"This study aims at characterizing the asymptotic behavior of genomic prediction R2 as the size of the reference population increases for common or rare QTL alleles through simulations. Haplotypes derived from whole-genome sequence of 85 Caucasian individuals from the 1,000 Genomes Project were used to simulate random mating in a population of 10,000 individuals for at least 100 generations to create the LD structure in humans for a large number of individuals. To reduce computational demands, only SNPs within a 0.1M region of each of the first 5 chromosomes were used in simulations, and therefore, the total genome length simulated was 0.5M. When the genome length is 30M, to get the same genomic prediction R2 as with a 0.5M genome would require a reference population 60 fold larger. Three scenarios were considered varying in minor allele frequency distributions of markers and QTL, for h2 = 0.8 resembling height in humans. Total number of markers was 4,200 and QTL were 70 for each scenario. In this study, we considered the prediction accuracy in terms of an estimability problem, and thereby provided an upper bound for reliability of prediction, and thus, for prediction R2. Genomic prediction methods GBLUP, BayesB and BayesC were compared. Our results imply that for human height variable selection methods BayesB and BayesC applied to a 30M genome have no advantage over GBLUP when the size of reference population was small (<6,000 individuals), but are superior as more individuals are included in the reference population. All methods become asymptotically equivalent in terms of prediction R2, which approaches genomic heritability when the size of the reference population reaches 480,000 individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2515893491,"International public health guidelines recommend that adults undertake at least 150 min.week−1 of moderate-intensity physical activity. However, the underpinning evidence has largely been obtained from studies of populations of white European descent. It is unclear whether these recommendations are appropriate for other ethnic groups, particularly South Asians, who have greater cardio-metabolic risk than white Europeans. The objective of our study was to determine the level of moderate-intensity physical activity required in South Asians adults to confer a similar cardio-metabolic risk profile to that observed in Europeans of similar age and body mass index (BMI) undertaking the currently recommended levels of 150 min.week−1. 148 South Asians and 163 white Europeans aged 18 to 70 years were recruited. Physical activity was measured objectively via vertical axis accelerations from hip-worn accelerometers. Factor analysis was used to summarize the measured risk biomarkers into a single underlying latent “factor” describing overall cardio-metabolic risk. Sex did not modify the association between physical activity and the cardio-metabolic risk factor, so data for both sexes were combined and models adjusted for age, sex, BMI and accelerometer wear time. We estimated that South Asian adults needed to undertake 232 (95% Confidence interval: 200 to 268) min.week−1 in order to obtain the same cardio-metabolic risk factor score as a white European undertaking 150 minutes of moderate-equivalent physical activity per week. The present findings suggest that South Asian men and women need to undertake ~230 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week. This equates to South Asians undertaking an extra 10–15 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per day on top of existing recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W2517915074,"Essential proteins are indispensable to the viability and reproduction of an organism. The identification of essential proteins is necessary not only for understanding the molecular mechanisms of cellular life but also for disease diagnosis, medical treatments and drug design. Many computational methods have been proposed for discovering essential proteins, but the precision of the prediction of essential proteins remains to be improved. In this paper, we propose a new method, LBCC, which is based on the combination of local density, betweenness centrality (BC) and in-degree centrality of complex (IDC). First, we introduce the common centrality measures; second, we propose the densities Den1(v) and Den2(v) of a node v to describe its local properties in the network; and finally, the combined strategy of Den1, Den2, BC and IDC is developed to improve the prediction precision. The experimental results demonstrate that LBCC outperforms traditional topological measures for predicting essential proteins, including degree centrality (DC), BC, subgraph centrality (SC), eigenvector centrality (EC), network centrality (NC), and the local average connectivity-based method (LAC). LBCC also improves the prediction precision by approximately 10 percent on the YMIPS and YMBD datasets compared to the most recently developed method, LIDC."
https://openalex.org/W2507635883,"Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) released from cancerous tissues has been found to harbor tumor-associated alterations and to represent the molecular composition of the tumor. Recent advances in technologies, especially in next-generation sequencing, enable the analysis of low amounts of cfDNA from body fluids. We analyzed the exomes of tumor tissue and matched serum samples to investigate the molecular representation of the tumor exome in cfDNA. To this end, we implemented a workflow for sequencing of cfDNA from low serum volumes (200 μl) and performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of serum and matched tumor tissue samples from six non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and two control sera. Exomes, including untranslated regions (UTRs) of cfDNA were sequenced with an average coverage of 68.5x. Enrichment efficiency, target coverage, and sequencing depth of cfDNA reads were comparable to those from matched tissues. Discovered variants were compared between serum and tissue as well as to the COSMIC database of known mutations. Although not all tissue variants could be confirmed in the matched serum, up to 57% of the tumor variants were reflected in matched cfDNA with mutations in PIK3CA, ALK, and PTEN as well as variants at COSMIC annotated sites in all six patients analyzed. Moreover, cfDNA revealed a mutation in MTOR, which was not detected in the matched tissue, potentially from an untested region of the heterogeneous primary tumor or from a distant metastatic clone. WES of cfDNA may provide additional complementary molecular information about clinically relevant mutations and the clonal heterogeneity of the tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2507939558,"N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 are known to bind several different Importins to import the histones into the cell nucleus. However, it is not known what binding elements in the histone tails are recognized by the individual Importins. Biochemical studies of H3 and H4 tails binding to seven Importins, Impβ, Kapβ2, Imp4, Imp5, Imp7, Imp9, and Impα, show the H3 tail binding more tightly than the H4 tail. The H3 tail binds Kapβ2 and Imp5 with KD values of 77 and 57 nm, respectively, and binds the other five Importins more weakly. Mutagenic analysis shows H3 tail residues 11–27 to be the sole binding segment for Impβ, Kapβ2, and Imp4. However, Imp5, Imp7, Imp9, and Impα bind two separate elements in the H3 tail: the segment at residues 11–27 and an isoleucine-lysine nuclear localization signal (IK-NLS) motif at residues 35–40. The H4 tail also uses either one or two basic segments to bind the same set of Importins with a similar trend of relative affinities as the H3 tail, albeit at least 10-fold weaker. Of the many lysine residues in the H3 and H4 tails, only acetylation of the H3 Lys14 substantially decreased binding to several Importins. Lastly, we show that, in addition to the N-terminal tails, the histone fold domains of H3 and H4 and/or the histone chaperone Asf1b are important for Importin-histone recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2514051432,"The aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of basic and sport nutrition as well as perspectives of young Egyptian athletes. Structured interview survey measuring knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviors about basic and sport nutrition was administered to adolescent athletes recruited from 4 sport clubs and 2 fitness centers in Greater Cairo governorate. A total of 358 participants aged 13–18 years completed questionnaires. Basic nutrition knowledge was reasonable in almost all domains except fast food. Fixed breakfast (78.5%), home meals (lunch, 70.7%), and healthy snacks (55.8%) were the most positive features of the basic dietary pattern. More than 70% perceived themselves as knowledgeable about sport nutrition. The prevalence rate of sport supplement intake was (48.9%, n = 175), predominantly sport drinks (66.9%) and creatine (54.3%). Coaches were the primary source of sport nutrition information. Forty-four percent of participants (n = 77/175) reported supplement consumption during competition seasons only. Better physical appearance and enhancement of athletic performance were the major motivations for supplement intake. These findings indicate the necessity of a comprehensive nutrition education program targeting not only athletes and parents, but also coaching staff, health trainers and all sport team officials."
https://openalex.org/W2510907592,"Burkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes melioidosis. Inhalational exposure leading to pulmonary melioidosis is the most common clinical manifestation with significant mortality. However, the role of B. pseudomallei biofilm phenotype during bacterial-host interaction remains unclear. We hypothesize that biofilm phenotype may play a role in such interactions. In this study, B. pseudomallei H777 (biofilm wild type), B. pseudomallei M10 (biofilm mutant) and B. pseudomallei C17 (biofilm-complemented) strains were used to assess the contribution of biofilm to adhesion to human lung epithelial cells (A549), intracellular interactions, apoptosis/necrosis and impact on proinflammatory responses. Confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that B. pseudomallei H777 and C17 produced biofilm, whereas M10 did not. To determine the role of biofilm in host interaction, we assessed the ability of each of the three strains to interact with the A549 cells at MOI 10. Strain H777 exhibited higher levels of attachment and invasion compared to strain M10 (p < 0.05). In addition, the biofilm-complemented strain, C17 exhibited restored bacterial invasion ability. Flow cytometry combined with a double-staining assay using annexin V and propidium iodide revealed significantly higher numbers of early apoptotic and late apoptotic A549 cells when these were infected with strain H777 (1.52%) and C17 (1.43%) compared to strain M10 (0.85%) (p < 0.05). Strains H777 and C17 were able to stimulate significant secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 compared with the biofilm mutant (p < 0.05). Together, these findings demonstrated the role of biofilm-associated phenotypes of B. pseudomallei in cellular pathogenesis of human lung epithelial cells with respect to initial attachment and invasion, apoptosis and proinflammatory responses."

Here, we identified a role for the flavoprotein monooxygenase MICAL3, an actin disassembly factor, in organizing midbody-associated protein complexes. By combining cell biological assays with cross-linking mass spectrometry, we show that MICAL3 is recruited to the central spindle and the midbody through a direct interaction with the centralspindlin component MKLP1. Knock-out of MICAL3 leads to an increased frequency of cytokinetic failure and a delayed abscission. In a mechanism independent of its enzymatic activity, MICAL3 targets the adaptor protein ELKS and Rab8A-positive vesicles to the midbody, and the depletion of ELKS and Rab8A also leads to cytokinesis defects.

Cytokinesis is the last step of cell division, during which the cytoplasm is partitioned between the two daughter cells.

Here, we searched for new binding partners of MICAL3 and identified the two components of the centralspindlin complex among the highest hits. Because centralspindlin is a major player during cytokinesis, we hypothesized that MICAL3 also participates in this process. We tested this possibility using a combination of biochemical and cell biological experiments and found that MICAL3 is indeed required for cytokinesis. We showed that MKLP1 recruits MICAL3 to the central spindle, whereas MICAL3 participates in targeting to the midbody its binding partners ELKS and Rab8A, and the loss of both ELKS and Rab8A also caused cytokinesis defects. Interestingly, the cytokinetic function of MICAL3 appeared not to require its enzymatic activity. Our data suggest that MICAL3 plays a role in organizing membrane trafficking at the intercellular bridge and that it acts in this process not as an actin disassembly factor but as a protein-binding hub. To get insight into the function of MICAL3, we performed a mass spectrometry-based screen for its binding partners. We co-expressed in HEK293T cells the biotin ligase BirA together with MICAL3 carrying a bioGFP tag, which consists of GFP with an N terminally attached artificial peptide that can be efficiently biotinylated by BirA (20de Boer E. Rodriguez P. Bonte E. Krijgsveld J. Katsantoni E. Heck A. Grosveld F. Strouboulis J.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7480-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and performed streptavidin pulldown assays from the lysates of these cells. BioGFP alone was used as a negative control. MICAL3 was the highest specific hit in this experiment, and the already known partners of MICAL3, ELKS (ERC1) and Rab8A, were also identified with high confidence (Fig. 1A). We also identified α- and β-spectrins (SPTAN and SPTBN1; Fig. 1A), which are large cortical proteins involved in the control of mechanical stability of cellular membranes and assembly of cortical cytoskeleton and specialized membrane domains (21Bennett V.

Membrane domains based on ankyrin and spectrin associated with cell-cell interactions.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2009; 1: a003012Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because MICAL3 can regulate actin disassembly, its binding to spectrins might play a role in controlling the organization of the cortical actin networks. Among the other major hits in this screen were the two components of the centralspindlin complex, MKLP1 (KIF23) and CYK-4 (RACGAP) (Fig. 1A). The validity of the interaction with centralspindlin is supported by the fact that MICAL3 was previously reported as one of the potential partners of MKLP1 in HeLa cells in a high-throughput screen (24Maliga Z. Junqueira M. Toyoda Y. Ettinger A. Mora-Bermúdez F. Klemm R.W. Vasilj A. Guhr E. Ibarlucea-Benitez I. Poser I. Bonifacio E. Huttner W.B. Shevchenko A. Hyman A.A. A genomic toolkit to investigate kinesin and myosin motor function in cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To investigate the interaction between MICAL3 and MKLP1 in more detail, we performed cross-linking mass spectrometry experiments. BioGFP-MICAL3 was co-expressed in HEK293 cells together with GFP-MKLP1 and BirA, biotinylated proteins were isolated by streptavidin pulldown, cross-linked on beads using disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO), and the cross-linked peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry as described previously (25Liu F. Rijkers D.T. Post H. Heck A.J. Proteome-wide profiling of protein assemblies by cross-linking mass spectrometry.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We identified multiple cross-links within both MICAL3 and MKLP1. The cross-links within folded domains of known structure (MICAL1 monooxygenase, MKLP1 C terminus) were in good agreement with the DSSO distance constraint of 28.4 Å (23.4 Å for the maximal distance constraint of the DSSO cross-linker plus 5-Å tolerance for protein flexibility in solution), validating our cross-linking mass spectrometry approach (Fig. 1, B and C, and supplemental Table S1). We also found many cross-links between different domains of MICAL3, compatible with the previously proposed autoinhibitory folding of MICAL proteins (Fig. 1B and supplemental Table S1) (8Grigoriev I. Yu K.L. Martinez-Sanchez E. Serra-Marques A. Smal I. Meijering E. Demmers J. Peränen J. Pasterkamp R.J. van der Sluijs P. Hoogenraad C.C. Akhmanova A.

Release of MICAL autoinhibition by semaphorin-plexin signaling promotes interaction with collapsin response mediator protein.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 2287-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Specific cross-links were also observed between the second and third coiled-coil region of MICAL3 and the coiled-coil and the adjacent C-terminal domain of MKLP1 (Figs. 1C and 2A, and supplemental Table S1). Pulldown assays confirmed the cross-linking results and showed that the minimal MKLP1-binding domain of MICAL3 encompasses its C-terminal coiled-coil region (MICAL3-CC4), whereas a stronger interaction was observed with a larger C-terminal fragment, which includes all the cross-linked sites (MICAL3-CC3, Fig. 2, B–E). Because the C termini of MICAL1 and MICAL3 are quite similar, we have also tested whether MICAL1 can interact with MKLP1, but found that this was not the case (Fig. 2D). The minimal MICAL3-binding domain of MKLP1 was present in the strongly charged and likely unstructured region located at the C-terminal side of the coiled coil of MKLP1 (Figs. 2A and 3, A–C). By deletion mapping, we identified a region of 13 residues, which was essential for the interaction (mutant D7), whereas the deletion of the adjacent 15-amino acid region (mutant D8) did not perturb the binding (Figs. 1C and 3, A and D, and supplemental Table S1). Taken together, our results show that MKLP1 and MICAL3 primarily interact through the unstructured polypeptide region in MKLP1 and the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of MICAL3, with additional contacts provided by the second coiled-coil domain of MICAL3 and the coiled-coil domain of MKLP1. We next examined the localization of endogenous MICAL3 in mitotic cells and found that whereas no conspicuous localization of MICAL3 could be detected at the early cell division stages, MICAL3 was clearly enriched at the spindle midzone starting from anaphase and strongly accumulated at the central spindle and the midbody during cytokinesis (Fig. 4A). Fluorescently tagged MICAL3 colocalized with the endogenous MKLP1 at the central spindle and the midbody (Fig. 4B). This localization did not depend on the enzymatic activity of MICAL3 as it was observed with the enzymatically dead MICAL3 mutant (Fig. 4C). Importantly, in MKLP1-depleted cells, MICAL3 failed to localize to the spindle midzone, indicating that MKLP1 targets MICAL3 to this location (Fig. 4, D–G). We next set out to test whether MICAL3 affects the localization of MKLP1. Because we did not manage to achieve an efficient siRNA-mediated knockdown of MICAL3, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-out technology. Cells transfected with a vector co-expressing a puromycin resistance gene, a single guide RNA sequence specific for MICAL3 and Cas9 (27Ran F.A. Hsu P.D. Wright J. Agarwala V. Scott D.A. Zhang F. Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system.Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8: 2281-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (6409) Google Scholar) were subjected to puromycin selection and analyzed at 6–7 days after transfection to avoid the selection of cells, in which the potential cell division defects would be compensated by secondary mutations. This procedure led to highly efficient knock-out of MICAL3 protein expression (Fig. 4H). We found that the loss of MICAL3 had no effect on MKLP1 binding to the central spindle or the midbody (Fig. 4I). We conclude that MICAL3 is recruited to sites of centralspindlin accumulation but has no effect on its distribution. To determine whether the loss of MICAL3 affects cell division, we performed phase-contrast-based live imaging experiments and found that compared with the cells transfected with the vector alone, MICAL3 knock-out cells displayed a slight delay between the mitotic onset and the initiation of furrow ingression, and a very significant (more than 2-fold) increase in the time between the completion of furrow ingression and abscission (Fig. 5, A–C, and supplemental Movies S1 and S2). We observed no abnormalities during the formation or ingression of the cleavage furrow and detected no visible defects in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton during different mitotic stages, including cytokinesis (Fig. 6, A and B). The data indicate that the actin-depolymerizing activity of MICAL3 is unlikely to contribute to the dynamics of the actomyosin ring. We did, however, observe a significant increase in the percentage of cells that fused back after furrow ingression and the corresponding increase in the percentage of binucleated cells (from ∼2 to ∼10%) (Fig. 5, A, D, and E, and supplemental Movie S3). To test whether this effect of MICAL3 was specific, we performed rescue experiments with GFP-tagged MICAL3 expression constructs (Fig. 5F). Although no rescue was observed with GFP alone, we could completely rescue the binucleated phenotype by either the full-length MICAL3 or its enzymatically dead mutant, but not with the MICAL3 deletion mutant lacking the MKLP1-binding C terminus (Fig. 5F). Thus, these data indicate that MICAL3 contributes to the stabilization and/or maturation of the intercellular bridge in a way that does not require its monooxygenase activity.FIGURE 6.Actin distribution in MICAL3 knock-out cells. A, immunostaining of MICAL3 (green) and actin (red) in control or MICAL3 knock-out cells. Insets, magnifications of the boxed areas. B, ratio of the intensity of actin at midzone to intensity in the cytoplasm in control or MICAL3 knock-out cells at different stages of cytokinesis. Around 100 cells were analyzed in 3 independent experiments. n.s., p > 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For comparison, we examined the phenotype of MKLP1 depletion and found that, as expected, its effect on cytokinesis was much more profound than that of MICAL3 knock-out, with ∼70% of binucleated cells (Fig. 5G). We observed a very significant although not complete rescue of this phenotype by expressing GFP-MKLP1 (Fig. 5G). The MKLP1 deletion mutant D7, which was unable to bind to MICAL3 and promote MICAL3 localization to the midbody (Figs. 3D and 5H), performed significantly less well in the rescue experiments than the wild type MKLP1 and the MKLP1-D8 mutant, which could restore MICAL3 accumulation at the midbody in MKLP1-depleted cells (Fig. 5, G and H). Although we cannot exclude that the D7 mutant perturbs MKLP1 function in ways unrelated to MICAL3 binding, our results are fully compatible with a role of MKLP1-dependent recruitment of MICAL3 as a factor contributing to the successful completion of cytokinesis. Because our data indicated that the contribution of MICAL3 to cytokinesis does not require its actin-destabilizing monooxygenase activity, we turned our attention to its binding partners. We first examined the distribution of ELKS, which was shown previously to bind to MICAL3 and participate in secretory vesicle docking (8Grigoriev I. Yu K.L. Martinez-Sanchez E. Serra-Marques A. Smal I. Meijering E. Demmers J. Peränen J. Pasterkamp R.J. van der Sluijs P. Hoogenraad C.C. Akhmanova A. Rab6, Rab8, and MICAL3 cooperate in controlling docking and fusion of exocytotic carriers.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 967-974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We found that ELKS prominently localized to the midbody in 90% of the cells, and that this localization was completely lost in MICAL3 knock-out cells (Fig. 7, A and B). Because MICAL3 is targeted to the midbody by MKLP1, these results suggest that MICAL3 might be able to connect ELKS to MKLP1. In support of this, mass spectrometry-based analysis of BioGFP-ELKS pull downs from HEK293 cells identified MKLP1 (KIF23) as a potential interacting partner (Fig. 7C). We next tested whether the interaction between MKLP1 and ELKS is mediated by MICAL3 and found that co-expression of MICAL3 indeed enhanced the ability of MKLP1 to co-precipitate ELKS (Fig. 7D). We conclude that MICAL3 can form a triple complex with MKLP1 and ELKS and through the interaction with the former, target the latter to the midbody. We have also examined the distribution of Rab8A-labeled membranes. Rab8A was present at ∼75% of the midbodies (Fig. 8, A and B). The intercellular bridges lacking Rab8A-positive structures appeared to represent very late stages of cytokinesis, in line with previous publications showing that Rab8A-positive vesicles are removed from the intercellular bridge prior to abscission (13Schiel J.A. Simon G.C. Zaharris C. Weisz J. Castle D. Wu C.C. Prekeris R. FIP3-endosome-dependent formation of the secondary ingression mediates ESCRT-III recruitment during cytokinesis.Nat.

Cortical constriction during abscission involves helices of ESCRT-III-dependent filaments.Science. 2011; 331: 1616-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The percentage of cells that exhibited at least some Rab8A signal at the intercellular bridge was significantly reduced in MICAL3 knock-out cells (Fig. 8, A and B), and the intensity of Rab8A staining in the midbody region was also reduced (Fig. 8C). In contrast, the localization of transferrin receptor-positive or Rab11-positive endosomes to the midbody was not perturbed by MICAL3 knock-out (Fig. 8, D and E). We conclude that MICAL3 specifically contributes to the recruitment of Rab8A to the midbody. Mass spectrometry-based analysis of ELKS binding partners in HEK293 cells identified citron kinase (CRIK) and its binding partner kinesin-3 KIF14 (Fig. 7C), whereas these proteins were not present in the MICAL3 pull down (Figs. 1A and 7C). We have examined whether the localization of CRIK or KIF14 was perturbed in MICAL3 knock-out cells and found this not to be the case (Fig. 8F). Although these data do not rule out that ELKS, localized to the midbody through its interaction with MICAL3, somehow affects the function of CRIK-containing protein complexes, they indicate that MICAL3 does not participate in the targeting of this signaling protein complex to the intercellular bridge, in line with the data showing that CRIK directly interacts with MKLP1 (28Bassi Z.I. Audusseau M. Riparbelli M.G. Callaini G. D'Avino P.P. Citron kinase controls a molecular network required for midbody formation in cytokinesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 9782-9787Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). If the cytokinetic defect of MICAL3 knock-out cells occurs due to the inability to properly localize ELKS and Rab8A-postive membranes, then the depletion of these proteins can be expected to perturb cytokinesis as well. We examined this possibility by depleting ELKS and knocking down ELKS and Rab8A (Fig. 8, G and H); the two proteins were depleted by 75% and 95%, respectively. The intensity of Rab8A staining in the midbody region in ELKS-depleted cells was reduced to values close to background (Fig. 8, A and I). The depletion of either ELKS or Rab8A led to a significant increase of binucleated cells (∼10%, similar to MICAL3 knock-out) (Fig. 8, J and K). We conclude that the complex of MICAL3 and ELKS helps to target Rab8A to the intercellular bridge, and that all three proteins are required to the proper maturation of the bridge, which prevents the bridge recession and promotes timely abscission. In this study we identified MICAL3 as a new molecular player in cytokinesis and a binding partner of MKLP1. Previous work has shown that centralspindlin represents a major binding hub for different factors involved in cytokinesis (4White E.A. Glotzer M. Centralspindlin: at the heart of cytokinesis.Cytoskeleton. 2012; 69: 882-892Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and our current work added MICAL3 to the list of MKLP1 interactors. Cross-linking experiments combined with mass spectrometry allowed us to show that the MICAL3-MKLP1 association is direct and to characterize the contact sites between the two proteins, illustrating the power of this approach. The MICAL3-binding region of MKLP1 is distinct from the MKLP1 sites known to bind to CYK-4, ARF6, or 14-3-3, but there might be some overlap with the binding sites for CRIK and CEP55 (Fig. 3A) (28Bassi Z.I.

Our data indicate that MICAL3 is involved in stabilization and maturation of the intercellular bridge, because its loss led to increased frequency of cytokinetic failure and extended duration of abscission. Surprisingly, despite the well established role of MICAL enzymes in actin disassembly, we found no evidence that MICAL3 regulates actin cytoskeleton during cytokinesis. Instead, MICAL3 recruits ELKS and Rab8A to the midbody (Fig. 9), and the depletion of these two proteins caused an increase of binucleated cells, indicative of cytokinetic defect.

Here, we generated retina-specific Rab11a (retRab11a) and Rab8a (retRab8a) single and double knockout mice to explore the consequences in mouse photoreceptors. Rhodopsin and other outer segment (OS) membrane proteins targeted correctly to OS and electroretinogram (ERG) responses in all three mutant mouse lines were indistinguishable from wild-type (WT). Further, AAV (adeno-associated virus)-mediated expression of dnRab11b in retRab11a-/- retina, or expression of dnRab8b in retRab8a-/- retina did not cause OS protein mislocalization. Finally, a retRab8a-/- retina injected at one month of age with AAVs expressing dnRab11a, dnRab11b, dnRab8b, and dnRab10 (four dn viruses on Rab8a-/- background) and harvested three months later exhibited normal OS protein localization. In contrast to results obtained with dnRab GTPases in Xenopus and zebrafish, mouse Rab11a and Rab8a are dispensable for proper rhodopsin and outer segment membrane protein targeting. Absence of phenotype after expression of four dn Rab GTPases in a Rab8a-/- retina suggests that Rab8b and Rab11b paralogs maybe dispensable as well. Our data thus demonstrate significant interspecies variation in photoreceptor membrane protein and rhodopsin trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2514987048,"Background Paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera (L.) L'Hér. ex Vent) is a dioecious tree native to East Asia and mainland Southeast-Asia, introduced prehistorically to Polynesia as a source of bark fiber by Austronesian-speaking voyagers. In Oceania, trees are coppiced and harvested for production of bark-cloth, so flowering is generally unknown. A survey of botanical records of paper mulberry revealed a distributional disjunction: the tree is apparently absent in Borneo and the Philippines. A subsequent study of chloroplast haplotypes linked paper mulberry of Remote Oceania directly to a population in southern Taiwan, distinct from known populations in mainland Southeast-Asia. Methodology We describe the optimization and use of a DNA marker designed to identify sex in paper mulberry. We used this marker to determine the sex distribution in selected localities across Asia, Near and Remote Oceania. We also characterized all samples using the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer sequence (ITS) in order to relate results to a previous survey of ITS diversity. Results In Near and Remote Oceania, contemporary paper mulberry plants are all female with the exception of Hawaii, where plants of both sexes are found. In its natural range in Asia, male and female plants are found, as expected. Male plants in Hawaii display an East Asian ITS genotype, consistent with modern introduction, while females in Remote Oceania share a distinctive variant. Conclusions Most paper mulberry plants now present in the Pacific appear to be descended from female clones introduced prehistorically. In Hawaii, the presence of male and female plants is thought to reflect a dual origin, one a prehistoric female introduction and the other a modern male introduction by Japanese/Chinese immigrants. If only female clones were dispersed from a source-region in Taiwan, this may explain the absence of botanical records and breeding populations in the Philippines and Borneo, and Remote Oceania."
https://openalex.org/W2513804411,"Background Acute febrile abdomen represents a diagnostic challenge in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Although criteria have been proposed for cyst infection (CyI) and hemorrhage (CyH), there is a lack of comparative assessments. Furthermore, distinguishing cystic from non-cystic complications remains problematic. Design ADPKD patients presenting with abdominal pain and/or fever between 01/2005 and 06/2015 were retrospectively identified in a systematic computerized billing database. CyH was defined as spontaneous intracystic density above 50 Hounsfield units on computed tomography (CT). CyI was definite if confirmed by cyst puncture, and probable if 4 criteria were met: 3-day fever, loin/liver tenderness, C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma levels >50mg/L and no CT evidence for CyH. Other episodes were grouped as inflammation of unknown origin (IUO). Results Among a cohort of 173 ADPKD patients, 101 presented with 205 episodes of abdominal pain (n = 172) and/or fever (n = 33). 20 patients experienced 30 CyH, whereas 16 presented 23 episodes of definite (n = 11) or probable (n = 12) CyI. 35 IUO were observed in 31 patients. Clinically, fever was observed in 7% vs. 100% vs. 66% of CyH, CyI and IUO, respectively. Biologically, CRP cut-off at 70 mg/dl showed 92% sensitivity and 81% specificity in CyI diagnosis. Urine or blood cultures remained sterile in >90% of CyH, but were contributive in 53.4% of CyI and IUO, with a 74.2% prevalence for E. coli. Radiologically, ultrasounds, CT and magnetic resonance diagnosed CyI in 2.6%, 20% and 16.7% of cases, respectively. 18F-FDG positron-emission tomography (PET)/CT was done within a median period of 7 days post antibiotics, and significantly changed patient management in 71.4%. Conclusions This retrospective single-center series underscores the usefulness of clinical–fever–and biological–CRP–parameters, but emphasizes the limitations of bacteriological and radiological investigations in cases of acute febrile abdomen in ADPKD patients. 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging may be helpful in such condition."
https://openalex.org/W2507969931,"Background Optimizing resuscitation is important to prevent morbidity and mortality from perinatal asphyxia. The metabolism of cells and tissues is severely disturbed during asphyxia and resuscitation, and metabolomic analyses provide a snapshot of many small molecular weight metabolites in body fluids or tissues. In this study metabolomics profiles were studied in newborn pigs that were asphyxiated and resuscitated using different protocols to identify biomarkers for subject characterization, intervention effects and possibly prognosis. Methods A total of 125 newborn Noroc pigs were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated and inflicted progressive asphyxia until asystole. Pigs were randomized to resuscitation with a FiO2 0.21 or 1.0, different duration of ventilation before initiation of chest compressions (CC), and different CC to ventilation ratios. Plasma and urine samples were obtained at baseline, and 2 h and 4 h after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC, heart rate > = 100 bpm). Metabolomics profiles of the samples were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results Plasma and urine showed severe metabolic alterations consistent with hypoxia and acidosis 2 h and 4 h after ROSC. Baseline plasma hypoxanthine and lipoprotein concentrations were inversely correlated to the duration of hypoxia sustained before asystole occurred, but there was no evidence for a differential metabolic response to the different resuscitation protocols or in terms of survival. Conclusions Metabolic profiles of asphyxiated newborn pigs showed severe metabolic alterations. Consistent with previously published reports, we found no evidence of differences between established and alternative resuscitation protocols. Lactate and pyruvate may have a prognostic value, but have to be independently confirmed."
https://openalex.org/W2527540711,"Heterotrimeric G proteins are localized to the plasma membrane where they transduce extracellular signals to intracellular effectors. G proteins also act at intracellular locations, and can translocate between cellular compartments. For example, Gαs can leave the plasma membrane and move to the cell interior after activation. However, the mechanism of Gαs translocation and its intracellular destination are not known. Here we use bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to show that after activation, Gαs rapidly associates with the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and endosomes, consistent with indiscriminate sampling of intracellular membranes from the cytosol rather than transport via a specific vesicular pathway. The primary source of Gαs for endosomal compartments is constitutive endocytosis rather than activity-dependent internalization. Recycling of Gαs to the plasma membrane is complete 25 min after stimulation is discontinued. We also show that an acylation-deacylation cycle is important for the steady-state localization of Gαs at the plasma membrane, but our results do not support a role for deacylation in activity-dependent Gαs internalization."
https://openalex.org/W2508850208,"Trauma represents the leading cause of death among young people in western countries. Among the beneficial role of neutrophils in host defence, excessive priming and activation of neutrophils after major trauma lead to an overwhelming inflammatory response and secondary host tissue injury due to the release of toxic metabolites and enzymes. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy has been proposed to possess antiinflammatory effects and might represent an appropriate therapeutic option to lower inflammation in a broad range of patients. Here, we studied the effects of HBO on the activity of neutrophils isolated from severely injured patients (days 1-2 after trauma), in fact on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). We found exposure to HBO therapy to significantly diminish phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced ROS production in neutrophils isolated from patients and healthy volunteers. At the same time, marked decrease in NETs release was found in control cells and a less pronounced reduction in patient neutrophils. Impaired ability to produce ROS following exposure to HBO was demonstrated to be linked to a strong downregulation of the activity of p38 MAPK. Only slight suppression of ERK activity could be found. In addition, HBO did not influence neutrophil chemotaxis or apoptosis, respectively. Collectively, this study shows for the first time that HBO therapy suppresses ROS production in inflammatory human neutrophils, and thus might impair ROS-dependent pathways, e.g. kinases activation and NETs release. Thus, HBO might represent a feasible therapy for patients suffering from systemic inflammation, including those with multiple trauma."
https://openalex.org/W2518221998,"S-nitrosylation of several Ca2+ regulating proteins in response to β-adrenergic stimulation was recently described in the heart; however the specific nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoform and signaling pathways responsible for this modification have not been elucidated. NOS-1 activity increases inotropism, therefore, we tested whether β-adrenergic stimulation induces NOS-1-dependent S-nitrosylation of total proteins, the ryanodine receptor (RyR2), SERCA2 and the L-Type Ca2+ channel (LTCC). In the isolated rat heart, isoproterenol (10 nM, 3-min) increased S-nitrosylation of total cardiac proteins (+46±14%) and RyR2 (+146±77%), without affecting S-nitrosylation of SERCA2 and LTCC. Selective NOS-1 blockade with S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline (SMTC) and Nω-propyl-l-arginine decreased basal contractility and relaxation (−25–30%) and basal S-nitrosylation of total proteins (−25–60%), RyR2, SERCA2 and LTCC (−60–75%). NOS-1 inhibition reduced (−25–40%) the inotropic response and protein S-nitrosylation induced by isoproterenol, particularly that of RyR2 (−85±7%). Tempol, a superoxide scavenger, mimicked the effects of NOS-1 inhibition on inotropism and protein S-nitrosylation; whereas selective NOS-3 inhibitor L-N5-(1-Iminoethyl)ornithine had no effect. Inhibition of NOS-1 did not affect phospholamban phosphorylation, but reduced its oligomerization. Attenuation of contractility was abolished by PKA blockade and unaffected by guanylate cyclase inhibition. Additionally, in isolated mouse cardiomyocytes, NOS-1 inhibition or removal reduced the Ca2+-transient amplitude and sarcomere shortening induced by isoproterenol or by direct PKA activation. We conclude that 1) normal cardiac performance requires basal NOS-1 activity and S-nitrosylation of the calcium-cycling machinery; 2) β-adrenergic stimulation induces rapid and reversible NOS-1 dependent, PKA and ROS-dependent, S-nitrosylation of RyR2 and other proteins, accounting for about one third of its inotropic effect."
https://openalex.org/W2509013511,"Background Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have been implicated in multiple organ failure, predominantly via their cellular receptor (RAGE) in preclinical studies. Little is known about the time course and prognostic relevance of AGEs in critically ill human patients, including those with severe sepsis. Objective 1) To explore the reliability of Skin Autofluorescence (AF) as an index of tissue AGEs in ICU patients, 2) to compare its levels to healthy controls, 3) to describe the time course of AGEs and influencing factors during ICU admission, and 4) to explore their association with disease severity, outcome, and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Methods Skin AF, serum N""-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL), N""-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), and soluble RAGE (sRAGE) were serially measured for a maximum of 7 days in critically ill ICU patients with multiple organ failure and compared to age-matched healthy controls. Correlations with (changes in) clinical parameters of disease severity, LDL dienes, and CRP were studied and survival analysis for in-hospital mortality was performed. Results Forty-five ICU patients (age: 59±15 years; 60% male), and 37 healthy controls (59±14; 68%) were included. Skin AF measurements in ICU patients were reproducible (CV right-left arm: 13%, day-to-day: 10%), with confounding effects of skin reflectance and plasma bilirubin levels. Skin AF was higher in ICU patients vs healthy controls (2.7±0.7 vs 1.8±0.3 au; p<0.001). Serum CEL (23±10 vs, 16±3 nmol/gr protein; p<0.001), LDL dienes (19 (15–23) vs. 9 (8–11) μmol/mmol cholesterol; <0.001), and sRAGE (1547 (998–2496) vs. 1042 (824–1388) pg/ml; p = 0.003) were significantly higher in ICU patients compared to healthy controls, while CML was not different (27 (20–39) vs 29 (25–33) nmol/gr protein). While CRP and LDL dienes decreased significantly, Skin AF and serum AGEs and sRAGE did not change significantly during the first 7 days of ICU admission. CML and CEL were strongly correlated with SOFA scores and CML above the median at baseline was associated with increased risk for mortality (Hazard ratio 3.3 (1.3–8.3); p = 0.01). All other markers did not correlate with disease severity and did not predict mortality. Conclusions This study demonstrates that markers for the AGE-RAGE axis are elevated in critically ill patients compared to healthy controls but remain stable for at least 7 days despite clearly fading inflammation and oxidative stress. Circulating AGEs may be associated with disease severity and outcome. Further research should be conducted to elucidate the role of the AGE-RAGE axis in the exaggerated inflammatory response leading to multiple organ failure and death, and whether or not this may be a target for treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2510221862,"Lung hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension are the major causes of mortality in neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Although the prostaglandin pathway plays a pivotal role in lung development, the reported efficacy of postnatal prostaglandin agonist treatment is suboptimal. We hypothesized that prenatal treatment with ONO-1301SR, a slow-release form of a novel synthetic prostacyclin agonist with thromboxane inhibitory activity, might enhance the development of lungs exhibiting hypoplasia in the fetal period. On embryonic day (E) 9.5, nitrofen was given to pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats to establish a CDH-related lung hypoplasia model, whereas normal rats received the vehicle only. The same day, either ONO-1301SR or a placebo was also randomly administered. On E21.5, the fetuses of the normal group and those exhibiting CDH were analyzed. Prenatal ONO-1301SR administration had no influence on the incidence of nitrofen-induced CDH. The lung-to-body weight ratio in the CDH+ONO group was greater than that in the CDH group. Histologically, the medial wall in the CDH+ONO group was two-thirds thinner than that in the CDH group. In addition, the number of Ttf-1-positive cells and the capillary density were ≥1.5 times greater in the CDH+ONO group than in the CDH group, and this increase was associated with higher expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and stromal cell-derived factor in the CDH+ONO group, suggesting enhanced development of the alveolar and capillary networks. Thus, prenatal ONO-1301SR was protective against the progression of lung hypoplasia associated with CDH in a nitrofen-induced rat model, indicating the potential of this treatment for pathologies exhibiting lung hypoplasia."
https://openalex.org/W2513342942,"Traditional methods for trait phenotyping have been a bottleneck for research in many crop species due to their intensive labor, high cost, complex implementation, lack of reproducibility and propensity to subjective bias. Recently, multiple high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed, but most of them are expensive, species-dependent, complex to use, and available only for major crops. To overcome such limitations, we present the open-source software GiNA, which is a simple and free tool for measuring horticultural traits such as shape- and color-related parameters of fruits, vegetables, and seeds. GiNA is multiplatform software available in both R and MATLAB® programming languages and uses conventional images from digital cameras with minimal requirements. It can process up to 11 different horticultural morphological traits such as length, width, two-dimensional area, volume, projected skin, surface area, RGB color, among other parameters. Different validation tests produced highly consistent results under different lighting conditions and camera setups making GiNA a very reliable platform for high-throughput phenotyping. In addition, five-fold cross validation between manually generated and GiNA measurements for length and width in cranberry fruits were 0.97 and 0.92. In addition, the same strategy yielded prediction accuracies above 0.83 for color estimates produced from images of cranberries analyzed with GiNA compared to total anthocyanin content (TAcy) of the same fruits measured with the standard methodology of the industry. Our platform provides a scalable, easy-to-use and affordable tool for massive acquisition of phenotypic data of fruits, seeds, and vegetables."

https://openalex.org/W2512677348,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection results from inadequate HBV-specific immunity. BDCA3+ dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells considered to be important for antiviral responses because of specific characteristics, including high interferon-λ production. BDCA3+ DCs may thus also have a role in the immune response against HBV, and immunotherapeutic strategies aiming to activate DCs, including BDCA3+ DCs, in patient livers may represent an interesting treatment option for chronic HBV. However, neither the effect of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection on the frequency and function of BDCA3+ DCs in liver and blood, nor the effect of the viral surface protein (HBsAg) that is abundantly present in blood of infected individuals are known. Here, we provide an overview of BDCA3+ DC frequency and functional capacity in CHB patients. We find that intrahepatic BDCA3+ DC numbers are increased in CHB patients. BDCA3+ DCs from patient blood are not more mature at steady state, but display an impaired capacity to mature and to produce interferon-λ upon polyI:C stimulation. Furthermore, in vitro experiments exposing blood and intrahepatic BDCA3+ DCs to the viral envelope protein HBsAg demonstrate that HBsAg does not directly induce phenotypical maturation of BDCA3+ DCs, but may reduce IFN-λ production via an indirect unknown mechanism. These results suggest that BDCA3+ DCs are available in the blood and on site in HBV infected livers, but measures may need to be taken to revive their function for DC-targeted therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2509710993,"Double oxide films (bifilms) are significant defects in the casting of light alloys, and have been shown to decrease tensile and fatigue properties, and also to increase their scatter, making casting properties unreproducible and unreliable. A bifilm consists of doubled-over oxide films containing a gas-filled crevice and is formed due to surface turbulence of the liquid metal during handling and/or pouring. Previous studies has shown that the nature of oxide film defects may change with time, as the atmosphere inside the bifilm could be consumed by reaction with the surrounding melt, which may enhance the mechanical properties of Al alloy castings. As a proxy for a bifilm, an air bubble was trapped within an Al-7wt.%Si-0.3wt.%Mg (2L99) alloy melt, subjected to stirring. The effect of different parameters such as the holding time, stirring velocity and melt temperature on the change in gas composition of the bubble was investigated, using a design of experiments (DoE) approach. Also, the solid species inside the bubbles solidified in the melt were examined using SEM. The results suggested that both oxygen and nitrogen inside the bifilm would be consumed by reaction with the surrounding melt producing MgAl2O4 and AlN, respectively. Also, hydrogen was suggested to consistently diffuse into the defect. The reaction rates and the rate of H diffusion were shown to increase upon increasing the holding time and temperature, and stirring velocity. Such significant effect of the process parameters studied on the gaseous content of the bubble suggesting that a careful control of such parameters might lead to the deactivation of bifilm defects, or at least elimination of their deteriorous effect in light alloy castings."
https://openalex.org/W2510568114,"Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) glycoproteins present cytosolic peptides to CD8+ T cells and regulate NK cell activity. Their heavy chains (HC) are expressed from up to three MHC gene loci (human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-A, -B, and -C in humans), whose extensive polymorphism maps predominantly to the antigen-binding groove, diversifying the bound peptide repertoire. Codominant expression of MHCI alleles is thus functionally critical, but how it is regulated is not fully understood. Here, we have examined the effect of polymorphism on the turnover rates of MHCI molecules in cell lines with functional MHCI peptide loading pathways and in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs). Proteins were labeled biosynthetically with heavy water (2H2O), folded MHCI molecules immunoprecipitated, and tryptic digests analysed by mass spectrometry. MHCI-derived peptides were assigned to specific alleles and isotypes, and turnover rates quantified by 2H incorporation, after correcting for cell growth. MHCI turnover half-lives ranged from undetectable to a few hours, depending on cell type, activation state, donor, and MHCI isotype. However, in all settings, the turnover half-lives of alleles of the same isotype were similar. Thus, MHCI protein turnover rates appear to be allele-independent in normal human cells. We propose that this is an important feature enabling the normal function and codominant expression of MHCI alleles."

Therefore, their biocompatibilities must be evaluated prior to their massive deployment. Using a microarray-based approach, we analyzed modifications to the whole genome of a human keratinocyte model that was exposed at 60.4 GHz-MMW at an incident power density (IPD) of 20 mW/cm2 for 3 hours in athermic conditions. No keratinocyte transcriptome modifications were observed. We tested the effects of MMWs on cell metabolism by co-treating MMW-exposed cells with a glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2dG, 20 mM for 3 hours), and whole genome expression was evaluated along with the ATP content. We found that the 2dG treatment decreased the cellular ATP content and induced a high modification in the transcriptome (632 coding genes). The affected genes were associated with transcriptional repression, cellular communication and endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis. The MMW/2dG co-treatment did not alter the keratinocyte ATP content, but it did slightly alter the transcriptome, which reflected the capacity of MMW to interfere with the bioenergetic stress response. The RT-PCR-based validation confirmed 6 MMW-sensitive genes (SOCS3, SPRY2, TRIB1, FAM46A, CSRNP1 and PPP1R15A) during the 2dG treatment. These 6 genes encoded transcription factors or inhibitors of cytokine pathways, which raised questions regarding the potential impact of long-term or chronic MMW exposure on metabolically stressed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2513228027,"Despite the growing number of experimental studies on mechanisms of social immunity in ant societies, little is known about how social behavior relates to disease progression within the nests of ants. In fact, when empirically studying disease in ant societies, it is common to remove dead ants from experiments to confirm infection by the studied parasite. This unfortunately does not allow disease to progress within the nest as it may be assumed would happen under natural conditions. Therefore, the approach taken so far has resulted in a limited knowledge of diseases dynamics within the nest environment. Here we introduced a single infectious cadaver killed by the fungus Beauveria bassiana into small nests of the ant Camponotus castaneus. We then observed the natural progression of the disease by not removing the corpses of the ants that died following the first entry of the disease. Because some behaviors such as social isolation of sick individuals or the removal of cadavers by nestmates are considered social immune functions and thus adaptations at the colony level that reduce disease spread, we also experimentally confined some sub-colonies to one or two chamber nests to prevent the expression of such behaviors. Based on 51 small nests and survival studies in 1,003 ants we found that a single introduced infectious cadaver was able to transmit within the nest, and social immunity did not prevent the collapse of the small sub-colonies here tested. This was true whether ants did or did not have the option to remove the infectious cadaver. Therefore, we found no evidence that the typically studied social immunity behaviors can reduce disease spread in the conditions here tested."
https://openalex.org/W2516644181,"Renal denervation (RD) was reported to reduce the susceptibility of atrial fibrillation (AF), but the underlying mechanism has not been well understood. This study was performed to investigate the effect of RD on the inducibility of AF in a rabbit model for atrial fibrosis and to explore the potential mechanisms. Thirty-five rabbits were randomly assigned into sham-operated group (n = 12), abdominal aortic constriction (AAC) group (n = 12) and AAC with RD (AAC-RD) group (n = 11). The incidence of AF induced by burst pacing in atriums was determined. Blood was collected to measure the levels of rennin, angiotensin II and aldosterone. Atrial samples were preserved to evaluate protein and gene expression of collagen, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Our data suggested cardiac structure remodeling and atrial fibrosis were successfully induced by AAC. Compared with the AAC group, the AAC-RD rabbits had smaller ascending aortic diameter and left ventricular end-systolic diameter. For burst pacing at the left atrium (LA), AF was induced in two of the 12 rabbits in the sham-operated group, 10 of the 12 rabbits in the AAC group, and 2 of the 11 rabbits in the AAC-RD group, with great difference among the three groups (P = 0.001). The percentage of LA burst stimulations with induced AF achieved 47.2% in the AAC group, which was higher than those in both the AAC-RD (12.1%) and the Sham-operated (5.6%) groups. Significantly increasing intercellular space in the AAC group (P<0.001) compared with the sham-operated rabbits. RD clearly decreased the volume fraction of collagen in LA and right atrium compared with that of the AAC group (P< 0.01). AAC-induced elevation of collagen I, CTGF and TGF-β1 was suppressed by RD. In conclusion, RD suppressed the inducibility of AF in a rabbit model for pressure associated atrial fibrosis, potentially by modulating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and decreasing pro-fibrotic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2509153986,"Neurotransmitters and peptide hormones are secreted by regulated vesicle exocytosis. CAPS (also known as CADPS) is a 145-kDa cytosolic and peripheral membrane protein required for vesicle docking and priming steps that precede Ca2+-triggered vesicle exocytosis. CAPS binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and SNARE proteins and is proposed to promote SNARE protein complex assembly for vesicle docking and priming. We characterized purified soluble CAPS as mainly monomer in equilibrium with small amounts of dimer. However, the active form of CAPS bound to PC12 cell membranes or to liposomes containing PI(4,5)P2 and Q-SNARE proteins was mainly dimer. CAPS dimer formation required its C2 domain based on mutation or deletion studies. Moreover, C2 domain mutations or deletions resulted in a loss of CAPS function in regulated vesicle exocytosis, indicating that dimerization is essential for CAPS function. Comparison of the CAPS C2 domain to a structurally defined Munc13-1 C2A domain dimer revealed conserved residues involved in CAPS dimerization. We conclude that CAPS functions as a C2 domain-mediated dimer in regulated vesicle exocytosis. The unique tandem C2-PH domain of CAPS may serve as a PI(4,5)P2-triggered switch for dimerization. CAPS dimerization may be coupled to oligomeric SNARE complex assembly for vesicle docking and priming."
https://openalex.org/W2516291096,"The mechanism underlying non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we hypothesized that Parkinson patients with more non-motor symptoms have a different pattern of striatal dopamine depletion, particularly in areas other than the sensorimotor striatum, compared to those with fewer non-motor symptoms.We conducted a prospective survey of the degree of non-motor symptoms (using the Korean version of the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale; K-NMSS) in 151 patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease who had undergone a dopamine transporter PET scan as an initial diagnostic procedure. We classified the patients into two groups; high non-motor patients (HNM-PD; K-NMSS score ≥ 41) and low non-motor patients (LNM-PD).Patients in the HNM-PD group (n = 71) were older, had longer symptom duration, exhibited more severe motor deficits, and had been prescribed higher levodopa-equivalent doses at follow-up than those in the LNM-PD group. However, dopamine transporter binding to the striatal sub-regions and inter-sub-regional binding ratios were comparable between the two groups. A general linear model showed that the HNM-PD group had significantly more severe motor deficits than the LNM-PD group after controlling for age, gender, symptom duration, and dopamine transporter binding to the sensorimotor striatum.This study demonstrated that the pattern of striatal dopamine depletion does not contribute to early non-motor burden in Parkinson's disease. Our results suggest that LNM-PD patients may have a more benign course of motor symptom progression than HNM-PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2516615732,"Antigen presentation to the T-cell receptor leads to sustained cytosolic Ca2+ elevation, which is critical for T-cell activation. We previously showed that in activated T cells, Ca2+ clearance is inhibited by the end oplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1) via association with the plasma membrane Ca2+/ATPase 4 (PMCA4) Ca2+ pump. Having further observed that expression of both proteins is increased in activated T cells, the current study focused on mechanisms regulating both up-regulation of STIM1 and PMCA4 and assessing how this up-regulation contributes to control of Ca2+ clearance. Using a STIM1 promoter luciferase vector, we found that the zinc finger transcription factors early growth response (EGR) 1 and EGR4, but not EGR2 or EGR3, drive luciferase activity. We further found that neither STIM1 nor PMCA4 is up-regulated when both EGR1 and EGR4 are knocked down using RNA interference. Further, under these conditions, activation-induced Ca2+ clearance inhibition was eliminated with little effect on Ca2+ entry. Finally, we found that nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) activity is profoundly attenuated if Ca2+ clearance is not inhibited by STIM1. These findings reveal a critical role for STIM1-mediated control of Ca2+ clearance in NFAT induction during T-cell activation.—Samakai, E., Hooper, R., Martin, K.

This study aimed to compare the difference of brain glucose metabolism between patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and control subjects. Methods NSCLC patients prior to oncotherapy and control subjects without malignancy confirmed by 6 months follow-up were collected and underwent the resting state 18F-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) PET/CT. Normalized FDG metabolism was calculated by a signal intensity ratio of each brain region to whole brain. Brain glucose metabolism was compared between NSCLC patients and control group using two samples t-test and multivariate test by statistical parametric maps (SPM) software. Results Compared with the control subjects (n = 76), both brain glucose hyper- and hypometabolism regions with significant statistical differences (P<0.01) were found in the NSCLC patients (n = 83). The hypermetabolism regions (bilateral insula, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, hippocampus and amygdala, the right side of cerebellum, orbital part of right inferior frontal gyrus and vermis) were component parts of visceral to brain signal transduction pathways, and the hypometabolism regions (the left superior parietal lobule, bilateral inferior parietal lobule and left fusiform gyrus) lied in dorsal attention network and visuospatial function areas. Conclusions The changes of brain glucose metabolism exist in NSCLC patients prior to oncotherapy, which might be attributed to lung-cancer related visceral sympathetic activation and decrease of dorsal attention network function."

Understanding this relationship would help healthcare providers target efforts to refer obese endometrial cancer survivors to weight loss and exercise interventions. Methods We conducted a survey of 213 endometrial cancer survivors who received cancer care at an academic l health system between 2006 and 2010. Physical function subscale was quantified using physical functional component score from the SF-12 questionnaire. We compared physical function of endometrial cancer survivors to population-based age-standardized normative values. Results Among the 213 patients, 16% were normal weight (BMI ≤25 kg/m2), and 52% were obese (≥30 kg/m2). Higher BMI categories were associated with lower physical function (Ptrend = 0.003), as a continuous variable each 5kg/m2 higher BMI, physical function score was lower by 0.15 points (β = -0.15; P = 0.045). Compared to population-based age-standardized normative values, patients <75yrs reported lower physical function, whereas patients ≥75yrs reported better physical function. BMI was the only covariate associated with differences in physical function between survivors and age-standardized normative values (P = 0.039). Conclusions Among endometrial cancer survivors, higher BMI is associated with lower physical function. Younger endometrial cancer survivors report lower physical function compared to age-standardized normative values. Healthcare providers should be aware that younger, obese endometrial cancer survivors may particularly benefit from interventions such as exercise and weight loss to increase or preserve physical function."

However, it is not clear whether we may obtain a more precise spatial localization of the focus of attention based on the EEG signals during central fixation. In this study, we used a modified Posner cueing task with an endogenous cue to determine the degree to which information in the EEG signal can be used to track visual spatial attention in presentation sequences lasting 200 ms. We used a machine learning classification method to evaluate how well EEG signals discriminate between four different locations of the focus of attention. We then used a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) and a leave-one-out cross-validation framework to evaluate the decoding accuracy (DA). We found that ERP-based features from occipital and parietal regions showed a statistically significant valid prediction of the location of the focus of visuospatial attention (DA = 57%, p < .001, chance-level 25%). The mean distance between the predicted and the true focus of attention was 0.62 letter positions, which represented a mean error of 0.55 degrees of visual angle. In addition, ERP responses also successfully predicted whether spatial attention was allocated or not to a given location with an accuracy of 79% (p < .001). These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for visuospatial attention decoding and future paths for research are proposed."

The aim of this study was to assess the test-retest reliability and to estimate sample sizes required for future crossover and parallel study designs.The 10 Hz paradigm (500 rectangular pulses lasting 50 s) was repeated on two separate days with one week interval in twenty volunteers. Perceptual intensities to single electrical stimulation (SES) at the conditioned skin site and to mechanical stimuli (pinprick and light stroking) in immediate vicinity to the conditioned skin site were recorded. Superficial blood flow (SBF) was assessed as indicator of neurogenic inflammation. All outcome measures were assessed with 10 min interval three times before and six times after the CES. The coefficient of variation and intra-class correlation coefficient were calculated within session and between sessions. Sample sizes were estimated for future crossover (Ncr) and parallel (Np) drug testing studies expected to detect a 30% decrease for the individual outcome measure following 10 Hz CES.Perceptual intensity ratings to light stroking (Ncr = 2, Np = 33) and pinprick stimulation (491 mN) (Ncr = 6, Np = 54) increased after CES and showed better reliability in crossover than parallel design. The SBF increased after CES, and then declined until reaching a plateau 20 minutes postCES. SBF showed acceptable reliability both in crossover and parallel designs (Ncr = 3, Np = 13). Pain ratings to SES were reliable, but with large estimated sample sizes (Ncr = 634, Np = 11310) due to the minor pain amplification.The reliability of 10 Hz CES was acceptable in inducing LTP-like effects in the assessments of superficial blood flow, heterotopic mechanical hyperalgesia, and dysesthesia in terms of sample sizes for future crossover study designs."

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a potent cytokine that overcomes p53 function by suppressing its transcriptional activity. Here, we evaluated the effects of MIF on hyperthermia (HT)-induced apoptosis in MIFdeficient [knockout (KO)] and MIF-transgenic (Tg) mouse keratinocytes. Cells were exposed to HT at 44°C, and increased apoptosis was observed in MIF-KO and wild-type (WT) cells compared with MIF-Tg cells. To determine the mechanism, MIF-mediated changes in the cellular p53 level and its effects on p53-dependent death signaling (Bax and p21) and JNK signaling (p-JNK, JNK, β-Bad, and Bad) were investigated. MIF-Tg cells exhibited substantially decreased levels of p53 after HT treatment compared with WT and MIF-KO cells. In addition, HT treatment caused decreased expression of β-JNK and β-Bad in MIF-Tg cells; however, no such changes were observed in MIF-KO and WT cells. These results showed that the activation of JNK(p-JNK and β-Bad) and p53 may be involved in HT-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes and that enhanced endogenous MIF expression suppressed apoptosis.—Yoshihisa, Y., Rehman, M.

After genotyping 241 TS nuclear families trios, we analyzed three tag HDC single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs854150, rs854151, and rs854157) in a family-based study using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) and haplotype relative risk (HRR). TDT showed no over-transmission in these SNPs across the HDC region (for rs854150: χ2 = 0.472, P = 0.537, OR = 1.097, 95%CI = 0.738-1.630; for rs854151: χ2 = 0.043, P = 0.889, OR = 1.145, 95%CI = 0.767-1.709; for rs854157:χ2 = 0.984, P = 0.367, OR = 1.020, 95%CI = 0.508-2.049). HRR also showed the same tendency (for rs854150: χ2 = 0.211, P = 0.646, OR = 1.088, 95%CI = 0.759-1.559; for rs854151: χ2 = 0.134, P = 0.714, OR = 0.935, 95%CI = 0.653-1.339; for rs854157:χ2 = 0.841, P = 0.359, OR = 1.206, 95%CI = 0.808-1.799). Additionally, the haplotype-based haplotype relative risk showed a negative association. Although these findings indicate an unlikely association between HDC and TS in the Chinese Han population, a potential role for HDC cannot be ruled out in TS etiology. Future research should investigate this more thoroughly using different populations and larger samples."

Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage is associated with increased risk for development of SSIs in central vascular surgery. The risk for SSI can be reduced by perioperative eradication of S. aureus carriage in cardiothoracic and orthopedic surgery. This study analyzes the relation between S. aureus eradication therapy and SSI in a vascular surgery population. Methods A prospective cohort study was performed, including all patients undergoing vascular surgery between February 2013 and April 2015. Patients were screened for S. aureus nasal carriage and, when tested positive, were subsequently treated with eradication therapy. The presence of SSI was recorded based on criteria of the CDC. The control group consisted of a cohort of vascular surgery patients in 2010, who were screened, but received no treatment. Results A total of 444 patients were screened. 104 nasal swabs were positive for S. aureus, these patients were included in the intervention group. 204 patients were screened in the 2010 cohort. 51 tested positive and were included in the control group. The incidence of S. aureus infection was 5 out of 51 (9.8%) in the control group versus 3 out of 104 in the eradication group (2.2%; 95% confidence interval 0.02–1.39; P = 0.13). A subgroup analysis showed that the incidence of S. aureus infection was 3 out of 23 (13.0%) in the control group in central reconstructive surgery versus 0 out of 44 in the intervention group (P = 0.074). The reduction of infection pressure by S. aureus was stronger than the reduction of infection pressure by other pathogens (exact maximum likelihood estimation; OR = 0.0724; 95% CI: 0.001–0.98; p = 0.0475). Conclusion S. aureus eradication therapy reduces the infection pressure of S. aureus, resulting in a reduction of SSIs caused by S. aureus."
https://openalex.org/W2518590524,"Prion diseases, also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders infecting both humans and animals. Recent works have demonstrated that the soluble prion protein oligomer (PrPO), the intermediate of the conformational transformation from the host-derived cellular form (PrPC) to the disease-associated Scrapie form (PrPSc), exerts the major neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Rabbits show strong resistance to TSEs, the underlying mechanism is unclear to date. It is expected that the relative TSEs-resistance of rabbits is closely associated with the unique properties of rabbit prion protein oligomer which remain to be addressed in detail. In the present work, we prepared rabbit prion protein oligomer (recRaPrPO) and human prion protein oligomer (recHuPrPO) under varied conditions, analyzed the effects of pH, NaCl concentration and incubation temperature on the oligomerization, and compared the properties of recRaPrPO and recHuPrPO. We found that several factors facilitated the formation of prion protein oligomers, including low pH, high NaCl concentration, high incubation temperature and low conformational stability of monomeric prion protein. RecRaPrPO was formed more slowly than recHuPrPO at physiological-like conditions (< 57°C, < 150 mM NaCl). Furthermore, recRaPrPO possessed higher susceptibility to proteinase K and lower cytotoxicity in vitro than recHuPrPO. These unique properties of recRaPrPO might substantially contribute to the TSEs-resistance of rabbits. Our work sheds light on the oligomerization of prion proteins and is of benefit to mechanistic understanding of TSEs-resistance of rabbits."
