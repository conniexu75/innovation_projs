https://openalex.org/W2006988903,"Light plays a pivotal role in the development of plants. The photoregulation of plant genes involves recognition of light quality and quantity by phytochrome and other light receptors. Two gene families, rbcS and Cab, which code for abundant proteins active in photosynthesis, the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase and the chlorophyll a/b binding protein, show a 20-to 50-fold increase in transcript abundance in the light. Analyses in calli and transgenic plants of deletions of the rbcS gene and of chimeric constructions has allowed localization of two regions involved in light-induced transcription. One element is confined to a 33-base pair region surrounding the TATA box. In addition, an enhancer-like element contained within a 240-base pair fragment can confer phytochrome-induced transcription and organ specificity on nonregulated promoters."

Dust was found both ahead of and behind the orbital positions of these comets. This dust was produced by the low-velocity ejection of large particles during perihelion passage. More than 100 additional dust trails are suggested by the data, almost all near the detection limits of the satellite. Many of these dust trails may be derived from previously unobserved comets."
https://openalex.org/W2095450532,"A definitive long-term decrease in the extent of antarctic sea ice is not detectable from 9 years (1973 to 1981) of year-round satellite observations and limited prior data. Regional interannual variability is large, with sea ice decreasing in some regions while increasing in others. A significant decrease in overall ice extent during the mid-1970's, previously suggested to reflect warming induced by carbon dioxide, has not been maintained. In particular, the extent of ice in the Weddell Sea region has rebounded after a large decrease concurrent with a major oceanographic anomaly, the Weddell polynya. Over the 9 years, the trends are nearly the same in all seasons, but for periods of 3 to 5 years, greater winter ice maxima are associated with lesser summer ice minima. The decrease of the mid-1970's was preceded by an increase in ice extent from 1966 to 1972, further indicating the presence of cyclical components of variation that obscure any long-term trends that might be caused by a warming induced by carbon dioxide."
https://openalex.org/W1981628248,"Dental morphology of American Indians, Asians, and Pacific islanders is used with a multivariate statistic to estimate when genetic separation occurred between several populations. These estimates generally match independent estimates of separation. This method, called dentochronology, gives an American Indian fission date from Asians of about 13,000 ± 3,000 years ago, which agrees with archeological data and rules out a European origin because of temporal priority. Polynesians split from Southeast Asians 5,000 ± 2,200 years ago and are not derived from Melanesians. Ainu-Jomon originated in Sundaland 14,000 ± 3,300 years ago. Africans have been separated from Asian-Americans 60,000 ± 6,100 years."
https://openalex.org/W1974780891,"The 5 January 1972 announcement by President Richard Nixon that the United States would develop during the 1970's a new space transportation system-the space shuttle-has had fundamental impacts on the character of U.S. space activities. In retrospect, it can be argued that the shuttle design chosen was destined to fail to meet many of the policy objectives established for the system; the shuttle's problems in serving as the primary launch vehicle for the United States and in providing routine and cost-effective space transportation are in large part a result of the ways in which compromises were made in the 1971-72 period in order to gain White House and congressional approval to proceed with the program. The decision to develop a space shuttle is an example of a poor quality national commitment to a major technological undertaking."

The concentration of strontium-90 was usually about 10 times higher in the soil carried by the runoff than in the soil from the plow layer of the plots. Thus, a considerable concentration of Sr90 could occur in areas where runoff sediments accumulate."

https://openalex.org/W1996504667,"Homogeneous processes now account for 15 to 25% of the dollar volume of the chemical industry. Most processes now in use involve reactions of olefin double bonds. Progress has been made in some areas: reactions involving forming or cleavage of carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen bonds; activation of usually inert carbon-hydrogen bonds; the synthesis of asymmetric compounds. As has been the case for heterogeneous catalysis and catalysis by organometallic clusters, many investigators are studying the potential of homogeneous complexes to selectivity produce desired products from synthesis gas. In many cases, the homogeneous approaches appear to be a superior approach. The declining price of petroleum is an inhibiting factor in the development of these processes. Even simple olefin reactions are not fully understood. The ability to design homogeneous catalyst systems rationally will require ca 2 decades of research and development. 2 figures."

https://openalex.org/W2094140557,"Many proposals have been made for new initiatives in our nation's research and development system. But before rushing into untried approaches, we need to look to the foundations of the system that has worked so well for us in the past. We have a climate for venture capital that has never been better; the world's greatest research universities; an industrial base that is moving aggressively into high technology, spurred by competition; and a defense effort that can be a major asset to civilian R & D. We should build our future by understanding and using these existing strengths."
