https://openalex.org/W2135905960,"Basal cells of the stratified squamous epithelia of rabbit skin, cornea and esophagus appear morphologically similar. However, the histological features of their subsequent differentiation are different, and the three epithelia are characterized by distinctive keratin proteins. To analyze the relative importance of intrinsic versus extrinsic factors in regulating the differentiation of these epithelia, we compared their behavior under identical in vitro and in vivo conditions. When cultured in the presence of 3T3 feeder cells, keratinocytes from all three epithelia formed differentiating colonies. Although in culture the three cell types approached a common phenotype, they remained distinguishable morphologically and, in some cases, biochemically. When these cultured epithelial cells were trypsinized, suspended in medium and injected subcutaneously into athymic (nude) mice, each of the three cell types generated a characteristic cyst consisting of stratified squamous epithelium. Cultured skin, corneal and esophageal keratinocytes formed epithelia which were keratinized, nonkeratinized and parakeratinized, respectively. In addition, the injected skin and esophageal epithelial cells reacquired their distinctive in vivo keratin patterns. These data suggest that the three epithelia are not equipotential. Furthermore, since the distinctive in vivo phenotype of each epithelium was expressed when the cells were transplanted to the same subcutaneous site, the expression of these differences does not depend on specific mesenchymal instruction but on permissive factors not present in the culture system. Thus under in vivo conditions intrinsic divergence must play a predominant role in determining the characteristic phenotypes of the three epithelia. On the other hand, the finding that the morphological and biochemical differentiation of a given epithelium can be reversibly modulated by the external environment demonstrates that extrinsic factors may, under certain conditions, also play a role in regulating epithelial differentiation."

In examinations of the effect of ligation on the distribution of receptors in the vagus nerve by in vitro labeling light microscopic autoradiography, a large buildup of receptors was found proximal to the ligature. This result indicates an axonal flow of receptors."

The activity levels of natural killer cells from affected males were increased after treatment with interferon in vitro, but normal levels of killing were not obtained. Deficient activity of killer cells in individuals with immunodeficiency and chronic infection by Epstein-Barr virus may contribute to the development of lymphoproliferative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2064865590,"We have previously purified from Xenopus ovaries a protein factor (TF IIIA) which is necessary for the accurate in vitro transcription of 5S RNA genes. We now report that this factor (a 5S gene transcription effector) is identical by immunological, chemical and functional criteria to the protein associated with 5S RNA (the gene product) as a 7S ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex in immature oocytes. After oocyte maturation, TF IIIA is no longer detectable functionally or immunologically in unfertilized eggs, which do not synthesize 5S RNA in vitro. Moreover, we cannot detect TF IIIA immunologically in extracts fron Xenopus somatic cells which, nevertheless, efficiently transcribe 5S genes."

https://openalex.org/W2046913913,"Evidence is presented that a homogeneous cytoplasmic species known as 7S RNA is the only abundant RNA in uninfected HeLa cells which can form strong hybrids with the dominant family of middle repetitive DNA sequences in the human genome. These DNA sequences are known collectively as the Alu family, because most of them share a common Alu I restriction site. When purified 7S RNA was hybridized to three different genomic clones containing Alu family DNA sequences, a specific region (or regions) comprising at most half the RNA sequence was protected from mild digestion with T1 ribonuclease; moreover, the hybrids between 7S RNA and cloned Alu family DNA were imperfect, since T1 RNAase was able to nick the protected 7S RNA sequences under conditions where a true RNA: DNA duplex would have been resistant. This suggests that 7S RNA is encoded either by a small subset of the 300,000 Alu family sequences in the human genome or by an entirely different family of genes. The sequence of 7S RNA has been highly conserved through recent evolution, and in both avian and murine cells the RNA is selectively incorporated into oncornavirus particles during productive infection. The cellular function of 7S RNA is unknown."

https://openalex.org/W1598544247,"Treatment of rat superior cervical ganglia in culture with nerve growth factor (NGF) increases the amount of radioactive phosphate incorporated into a nuclear protein band. This band migrates coincidentally with H1 histone on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gels. The increase in phosphate incorporation is at least 70% and occurs only in tissues known to be responsive to NGF. It is not produced by treatment with related peptides, but is observed after the addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP. An increase in phosphorylation can be detected after 1 h, and can be seen with as little as 10 ng/ml of NGF in the medium. Neither actinomycin D nor cycloheximide inhibits the effect. When the nuclei are extracted with 0.2 M H2SO4 and the extract analyzed on acid-urea/polyacrylamide gels, two NGF-responsive proteins can be detected. One protein again migrates with the H1 histone marker; the other migrates more slowly than H1. These two NGF-responsive proteins have molecular weights of approximately 30,000 and are chromatin-bound. They are not soluble in 5% perchloric acid, but can be extracted from the nuclei with 0.35 M NaCl. No increase in the phosphorylation of these proteins was seen in ganglia from 6-hydroxydopamine-treated rats. The phosphorylation of the proteins in both control and NGF-treated ganglia occurs almost exclusively on serine residues. The amino acid compositions of the two nuclear proteins show that they are different from the H1 histone and different from each other. Both nerve growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) increase the incorporation of radioactive phosphate into a specific nuclear protein in cultures of PC12, a clone of rat pheochromocytoma. Purified NGF antibody blocks the effect of NGF, but not that of EGF; EGF antiserum neutralizes the effect of EGF, but not that of NGF. Insulin, glucagon, and dexamethasone are without effect. The increase in phosphorylation due to NGF can be detected within 1 h. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP increases the phosphorylation of this protein, but dibutyryl cyclic GMP does not. Neither the uptake nor the overall incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate is altered by NGF, EGF, or dibutyryl cAMP under the present experimental conditions. The nuclear protein exhibiting increased radioactivity is similar in solubility, size, and amino acid composition to one of the NGF-responsive nuclear proteins from sympathetic ganglia."

https://openalex.org/W2048522798,"2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), an extremely potent toxin, serves as the prototype of a large group of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, all of which produce a similar and characteristic pattern of toxic lesions, which includes hyperkeratosis and squamous metaplasia in the skin; induce a battery of coordinately expressed enzymes, the most studied of these being aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity; and appear to exert both their toxic effects and enzyme induction through stereospecific, reversible binding to a cytosolic receptor protein. Previous studies performed with over 30 cell types have failed to demonstrate any in vitro toxicity from TCDD. When XB cells derived from a mouse teratoma are cultured at high density (to prevent spontaneous differentiation) along with lethally irradiated 3T3 cells, the addition of TCDD produces a dose-related keratinization response as detected by red staining with Rhodanile blue. Maximal keratinization is produced by 5 × 10−11 M TCDD. This is a direct effect of TCDD on XB cells, and will occur in the absence of the feeder cells if the teratoma cells are cultured in 3T3-conditioned media. The keratinization produced by TCDD was examined by electron microscopy and histologic staining, and appears to be similar to that which occurs spontaneously when XB cells are plated at low density. XB cells contain the cytosol receptor and respond to TCDD with a dose-related induction of AHH activity. The potencies of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon congeners [dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans, biphenyls and azo(xy)benzenes] to produce keratinization in the XB/3T3 system corresponds to their binding affinities for the cytosol receptor. Nonhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, which are agonists for the receptor [such as benz(a)anthracene and 5,6-benzoflavone], also produce a dose-related keratinization in XB/3T3 cultures, whereas unrelated toxins (such as alkylating agents and inhibitors of nucleic acid synthesis) do not. Our results suggest that the keratinization produced by TCDD and congeners in XB/3T3 cultures is mediated by the cytosolic receptor, and that this system provides an in vitro model for the in vivo toxic effects produced by halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons in the epidermis."

https://openalex.org/W2044852019,"Smith and his colleagues have proposed that the duration of the cell cycle is determined by a random transition, analogous to the random decay of a radioactive nucleus, by which a cell passes from an 'A state' within the G1 phase to a 'B phase' that includes the rest of the cycle. The experimental support for this transition probability hypothesis is the tendency of a cumulative plot of differences of cycle times of sibling cells (the beta curve) to be exponential ad parallel to the exponential tail of a cumulative plot of the cycle times themselves (the alpha curve). However, a close examination of four of the most extensive sets of experimental data now suggests that the two beta curves with the steepest slopes may not, in fact, be exponential. These and all the other characteristics of the experimental curves are best matched by computer simulations using a cell-cycle model that will be termed here a G1 rate model. This model is consistent with differences in cell metabolism, rather than a transition at an inherently unpredictable time, being the physiological basis for differences in cycle times within a cell population."

It also shares the following properties with natural leukocyte interferon (IFN). (i) It enhances natural killing activity of human lymphocytes, (ii) it enhances antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, (iii) it suppresses antigen- and mitogen-induced leukocyte migration inhibition, (iv) it inhibits growth of IFN-sensitive Burkitt lymphoma cells. Since these activities are exhibited by a cloned protein species, they are due to IFN itself and not to other human proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1520513061,"Previous work has shown that any effect of exogenous auxin on gene expression in soybean hypocotyl tissue must be restricted to a relatively small fraction of the polyadenylated RNA. However, kinetic hybridization analysis with cDNA probes revealed that a minor abundant class of sequences is markedly reduced in concentrations in the auxin-treated polyadenylated RNA. Recombinant plasmids containing copies of polyadenylated RNA species were constructed using the G-C tailing procedure and clones of auxin-regulated sequences were detected by differential in situ hybridization with cDNA of polyadenylated RNA from auxin-treated or untreated hypocotyls. Although the 12 clones which were selected all contained different size inserts, and were therefore independent, 11 of these apparently hybridized to just two different RNA species. The rate constant of the auxin-sensitive abundant component of the untreated polyadenylated RNA/DNA hybridization was similar to that of the reaction between the two major groups of clones and untreated polyadenylated RNA. This indicates that these cloned sequences are homologous with that cDNA fraction. The twelfth clone is thought to be representative of a group of less abundnt auxin-regulated polyadenylated mRNA species which had been detected in an earlier analysis of the in vitro translation products of soybean hypocotyl RNA. Both the timing and the extent of the influence of auxin on the relative concentration of these cloned sequences are quite consistent with a close relationship between growth regulation by auxin and its effects on gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1607152330,"The DNA sequence orgainzation of the protein encoding region of the gene for silk fibroin has been analyzed. The accompanying paper (Manningm R. F., and Gage, L. P. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 9451-9457) shows that the total length of the gene, and its protein, as well as the pattern of restriction sites in the gene is highly polymorphic among inbred stocks of Bombyx mori, In this paper, those features of fibroin gene structure which are invariant among these alleles are presented. Fibroin is composed primarily of relatively short and peptides of known sequence whose arrangement in the protein is unknown. Knowledge of the codons most commonly used in fibroin mRNA allowed utilization of particular restriction inzymes as a means for determing the nature and organization of crystalline and amorphous coding sequences in the fibroin gene. Three restriction endonucleases were identified that cleve sequences coding for amorphous region peptides. Their cleavage pattern revelaed that the repetitive coding sequence of the gene core (approximately 15 kilobases) is divided into at least 10 large crystalline coding domains interrupted by smaller amorphous coding domains. Many restriction endoncleases do not cleave the fibroin core at all, three of them with four gase recognition sequences. Specific deductions as to codon usage and repetitive sequence homogeneity in the gene follow from these results. One novel finding is the rigorous exclusion of the glycine codon GGA prior to serine codons even though this glycine codon is used frequently prior to alanine codons. The sequence homogeneity and the regularly alternating arrangement of crystalline and amorphous coding sequences of the gene are discussed in terms of the function of fibroin protein and the evolution of highly repetitive DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1607559204,"Since insulin is known to stimulate intracellular hydrogen peroxide production in rat epididymal fat cells, the effects of exogenous hydrogen peroxide on rates of basal and hormone-stimulated lipolysis were investigated in a perifusion system. H2O2 (60 microM) caused a weak and transient stimulation of basal lipolysis that did not interfere with subsequent activation of lipolysis by hormones. More importantly, lipolysis stimulated submaximally with ritodrine (10(-7) M) or glucagon (10(-9) M) was inhibited by H2O2 in a manner similar to insulin, although slight differences in time course were noted. Ritodrine served as a beta-adrenergic agonist resistant to oxidative destruction by H2O2. The inhibition of lipolysis was reversible upon cessation of perifusion with H2O2. These findings ruled out oxidative destruction of the hormone or cell death as explanations for the antilipolytic effect of H2O2. Like insulin, H2O2 also inhibited 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (4 X 10(-6) M)-stimulated lipolysis, but whereas insulin inhibited lipolysis stimulated by dibutyryl-cAMP (4 X 10(-4) M), H2O2 further enhanced it. These findings add another case to the growing list of insulin effects on adipocytes that can be mimicked by exogenous H2O2, and they hint at a site where the mechanisms of action of the two agents may differ."

https://openalex.org/W1556330782,"Rat alpha 1-fetoprotein (AFP) and albumin mRNA levels have been examined in yolk sac and liver during late gestation and early neonatal life by cell-free translation and RNA-excess cDNA hybridization. AFP-specific sequences were found to comprise up to 25% of the total poly(A)-containing RNA in the yolk sac, and they were reduced about 10-fold in the fetal liver. Since comparable amounts of poly(A)-containing RNA were obtained from both tissues, these observations suggest that the yolk sac may be the major source of maternal and fetal plasma AFP in late gestation. The level of AFP mRNA sequences in fetal liver remained relatively constant during the last week of gestation and the first 2 weeks of neonatal life. In contrast, the concentration of albumin sequences increased steadily during this time, reaching about 85% of adult levels by 2 weeks of age. These results suggest that the expression of AFP and albumin genes may not be reciprocally regulated, but rather they may be regulated independently of each other during the perinatal period. Albumin-specific sequences were also detected in the poly(A)-containing RNA from yolk sac but at a level of more than 400-fold lower concentration than that of the fetal liver. It was especially noteworthy that the relative level of AFP sequences in the yolk sac decreased much earlier than that in the liver. Thus, AFP gene expression may be subject to different developmental controls in these two tissues. The continuation of AFP production in the liver following birth may indicate a continuing functional requirement for this protein in early neonatal life."

https://openalex.org/W1631460301,"The treatment of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells with mouse interferon increases the level of the latent enzyme (2'-5')(A)n synthetase. If activated by double-stranded RNA, this catalyzes the synthesis from ATP of a series of 2'-5'-oligoadenylates: (2'-5')(A)n where n extends from 2 to about 15. We isolated (2'-5')(A)n synthetase in a homogeneous state. In the presence of double-stranded RNA, the purified enzyme can convert the large majority (about 97%) of the ATP into (2'-5')(A)n and pyrophosphate, although it does not cleave the pyrophosphate. The stoichiometry of the reaction can be formulated as: (n + I) ATP leads to (2'-5') pppA(pA)n + n pyrophosphate. Added pyrophosphate does not inhibit the synthesis of (2'-5')(A)n. The extent of the reverse reaction, i.e. the pyrophosphorolysis of (2'-5')(A)n, was below the level of detection under our conditions. The affinity of the enzyme for ATP is low: the rate of the reaction increases by about 10% when the concentration of ATP is increased from 5 mM to 10 mM. The optimal concentration of double-stranded RNA increases with the concentration of the enzyme. As tested at 0.4, 2, and 10 micrograms/ml of enzyme concentrations, close to maximal (2'-5')(A)n synthesis can be obtained if reovirus double-stranded RNA or poly(I) . poly(C) are used at about half the concentration (in w/v) of the enzyme. The plot of the reaction rate versus enzyme concentration is sigmoidal. It remains to be seen if this reflects on a cooperative behavior of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1545595385,"Two mutants of the BW5147 mouse lymphoma cell line have been selected for their resistance to the toxic effects of pea lectin. These cell lines, termed PLR1.3 and PHAR1.8 PLR7.2, have a decreased number of high affinity pea lectin-binding sites (Trowbridge, I.S., Hyman, R., Ferson, T., and Mazauskas, C. (1978) Eur. J. Immunol. 8, 716-723). Intact cell labeling experiments using [2-3H]mannose indicated that PLR1.3 cells have a block in the conversion of GDP-[3H]mannose to GDP-[3H]fucose whereas PHAR1.8 PLR7.2 cells appear to be blocked in the transfer of fucose from GDP-[3H]fucose to glycoprotein acceptors. In vitro experiments with extracts of PLR1.3 cells confirmed the failure to convert GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose and indicated that the defect is in GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.47), the first enzyme in the conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose. The block in the PLR1.3 cells could be bypassed by growing the cells in the presence of fucose, demonstrating that an alternate pathway for the production of GDP-fucose presumably via fucose 1-phosphate is functional in this line. PLR1.3 cells grown in 10 mM fucose showed normal high affinity pea lectin binding. PHRA1.8 PLR7.2 cells synthesize GDP-fucose and have normal or increased levels of GDP-fucose:glycoprotein fucosyltransferase when assayed in vitro. The fucosyltransferases of this clone can utilize its own glycoproteins as fucose acceptors in in vitro assays. These findings indicate that this cell line fails to carry out the fucosyltransferase reaction in vivo despite the fact that it possesses the appropriate nucleotide sugar, glycoprotein acceptors, and fucosyltransferase. The finding of decreased glycoprotein fucose in two independent isolates of pea lectin-resistant cell lines and the restoration of high affinity pea lectin binding to PLR1.3 cells following fucose feeding strongly implicates fucose as a major determinant of pea lectin binding."
https://openalex.org/W1594958145,"Conditions are described for optimizing the synthesis of large oligosaccharide-lipids in microsomal preparations from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. On incubating microsomes, with GDP-[14C]Man, the major product obtained was Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol, but when both GDP-[14C]Man and UDP-[3H]Glc were present in the incubation mixture about half of the Man9GlcNAc2 was elongated to Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. Unlike particulate fractions from mammalian systems, little glucosylation of the yeast microsomal oligosaccharide-lipid was obtained when the concentration of UDP-Glc was less than 10 microM, but the synthesis of this product could be maximized by raising the concentration of UDP-Glc to 50 microM. Analysis of the yeast Man9GlcNAc2 species confirmed that 8 of the 9 mannose residues could be released with alpha-mannosidase, while the remaining mannosyl residue was in the core trisaccharide, Manbeta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc. Treatment of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 with alpha-mannosidase released 5 of 9 mannose residues and yielded Glc3Man4GlcNAc2. This product appeared to be identical with that obtained in parallel experiments with double labeled oligosaccharide-lipid synthesized in oviduct microsomes. Streptomyces plicatus endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo-H) treatment of yeast microsomal glycoproteins that were labeled with sugar nucleotides established that 15% of the label was associated with N-linked oligosaccharides. The remaining labeled sugars were released with alkali, indicating that they were linked to serine or threonine. Based on the size and distribution of [3H]glucose and [14C]mannose in the Endo-H-released oligosaccharides, it was concluded that Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 was the primary species transferred to proteins in the yeast system."

Together with fetal and adult globin chains, these early embryonic globins are encoded by two developmentally regulated multigene families. To facilitate analysis of the structure and evolution of early embryonic alpha-globin genes, we have determined the complete amino acid sequences of the pi and pi' alpha-like globins of the chick embryo. While differing from each other by an alanine/glutamic acid interchange at position 124, this pair of sequences differs from the major and minor adult alpha-globins by 43%. The early embryonic and adult alpha-like sequences appear to have diverged following an ancient gene duplication. We discuss specific amino acid substitutions in functional positions as possible mediators of the reduced Bohr effect and elevated oxygen affinity, which are characteristic of early embryonic hemoglobins."
https://openalex.org/W1970858189,"We present a model for the control of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated histamine release from human basophils. We suggest that there is a calcium gating factor which interacts with crosslinked IgE to form a short-lived open calcium channel. After formation of the channel the activated gating factor rapidly decays to an inactive form. It is the loss of the active gating factor which causes the basophil to desensitize nonspecifically. We propose that the crosslinked IgE molecules are deactivated by a mechanism, such as endocytosis or shedding, which is independent of the mechanism which inactivates the calcium gating factor. This loss of functional IgE leads to specific desensitization. The mathematical formulation of the model explains the relationship of specific and nonspecific desensitization to the amount of specific IgE on the basophil surface; explains why there are two types of antigen excess inhibition; explains the relationship between antigen excess inhibition and desensitization; explains why, for a fixed antigen concentration, increasing the concentration of cell surface IgE increases histamine release until an optimal concentration is reached, then decreases histamine release; predicts the effects that changing the external calcium will have on the dose response curve; and predicts that increasing the amount of specific IgE on the cell surface will cause the dose response curve to undergo a transition from a curve with a single maximum to a curve with two maxima."

Affinity chromatography of a partially purified preparation on agarose hexane 3',5'-ADP produces enzyme of high specific activity (351 units/mg). A total purification of 1750-fold over the mitochondrial matrix fraction is achieved. The purified enzyme is stable when stored in 30% glycerol with millimolar levels of dithiothreitol. Divalent cations (e.g. Mg2+, Mn2+) and thiol-protecting agents stimulate enzyme activity under assay conditions. The enzyme binds hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA with a Km = 8 microM. Optimal enzyme activity, measured at pH = 8.9, is 7-fold higher than activity at physiological pH. The apparent molecular weight of the native enzyme, estimated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, is approximately 49,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggests that the enzyme is a dimer, composed of 27,000-dalton subunits. Assuming one active site per subunit, a turnover number of 158 s-1 (pH 8.2; 30 degrees C) is calculated. Antibodies have been prepared against homogeneous hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase. Ouchterlony double diffusion patterns verify the homogeneity of the preparation. Incubation of enzyme with antiserum results in virtually complete inhibition of enzyme activity."

AFP complex for 30 min at 300 nm results in the covalent attachment of 19% of the ligand bound reversibly to the estradiol site at the time of irradiation. The photocovalent attachment appears to result from both a chromophore-dependent process (photoaffinity labeling), whose time course follows the photolytic consumption of the diazoketone chromophore and is not susceptible to scavenging by nucleophiles, and a chromophore-independent process (pseudophotoaffinity labeling) that results from covalent attachment of an electrophilic photoproduct and can be intercepted by 20 mM mercaptoethanol. AFP covalently labeled with 16-diazo[3H]estrone has the same electrophoretic mobility as unlabeled AFP on normal and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels; labeled AFP has an apparent molecular weight of 69,400 and is distinguishable from albumin (which is also labeled by 16-diazo[3H]estrone, but not in a site-specific manner).

Two facilitated diffusion systems were found. One, an electroneutral Ca2+/2H+ antiporter, responded to an artificially imposed deltapH, was heat-labile, and was insensitive to low concentrations of ruthenium red and lanthanides. The second, an electrogenic transporter, responded to an electrical membrane potential, was heat-stable, was inhibited by ruthenium red, lanthanides, monovalent cations, and certain anions. In vivo, when coupled to the protonmotive force, the systems would provide for the cell: (i) a mechanism to keep intracellular Ca2+ concentration low (Ca2+/2H+ antiporter); (ii) a mechanism for Ca2+ entry (electrogenic transporter)."

The induced alkaline phosphatase from a SV40 tsA30 mutant-transformed term placental cell line (TPA30-1) was purified, characterized, and compared with alkaline phosphatase from term placenta and first trimester placenta. The form of alkaline phosphatase found in TPA30-1 cells differs from the phosphatase of term placenta in physiochemical and immunological properties. The TPA30-1 phosphatase is, however, indistinguishable from the alkaline phosphatase of human first trimester placenta by several criteria, including electrophoretic mobility, apparent molecular weight (Mr = 165,000), size of monomeric subunit (Mr = 77,000), heat lability, and sensitivity to inhibition by amino acids and EDTA. In addition, alkaline phosphatase from both TPA30-1 cells and first trimester placenta can be inactivated by antiserum to liver alkaline phosphatase but not by antiserum to term placental alkaline phosphatase. The induction of first trimester phosphatase in cells derived from term placenta provides a system for the study of alkaline phosphatase gene regulation in human placenta."
