https://openalex.org/W2077400329,"Measurements of carbon-14 in small samples of methane from major biogenic sources, from biomass burning, and in ""clean air"" samples from both the Northern and Southern hemispheres reveal that methane from ruminants contains contemporary carbon, whereas that from wetlands, pat bogs, rice fields, and tundra is somewhat, depleted in carbon-14. Atmospheric (14)GH(4) seems to have increased from 1986 to 1987, and levels at the end of 1987 were 123.3 +/- 0.8 percent modern carbon (pMC) in the Northern Hemisphere and 120.0 +/- 0.7 pMC in the Southern Hemisphere. Model calculations of source partitioning based on the carbon-14 data, CH(4) concentrations, and delta(13)C in CH(4) indicate that 21 +/- 3% of atmospheric CH(4) was derived from fossil carbon at the end of 1987. The data also indicate that pressurized water reactors are an increasingly important source of (14)CH(4)."

With good flight conditions the effectiveness of birds and bees is essentially equal. Thus, the higher incidence of bird flowers at higher elevations is attributable in part to the competitive advantage gained through greater reproductive success."

https://openalex.org/W2018222356,"A priori quantum mechanical calculations have been carried out at about 150 linear geometries for the fluorine plus hydrogen molecule system. An extended basis set of Gaussian functions was used, and electron correlation was treated explicitly by configuration interaction. Comparison with the experimental activation energy and exothermicity suggests that the theoretical potential surface is quite realistic."

https://openalex.org/W2019810517,"Detailed knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the materials that make up the earth is necessary for fundamental understanding of most geological processes. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is beginning to play an important role in investigations of inorganic solid materials, as well as of liquids and organic compounds; it has already contributed substantially to our knowledge of minerals and rocks, compositionally simplified analogs of magmas, and the surfaces of silicate crystals. The technique is particularly useful for determining local structure and ordering state in crystals, glasses, and liquids, and is sensitive to atomic motion at the time scales of diffusion and viscosity in silicates. New techniques offer promise for increased resolution for quadrupolar nuclei and for extension of experiments to high temperature and pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2089350147,"The endosperm proteins of the maize mutants, opaque-2, opaque-7, floury-2, brittle-2, and the double mutant of opaque-2 and brittle-2, were separated into five soluble fractions by the Landry-Moureaux method. As compared to their isogenic normal counterparts, the mutant endosperms had higher concentrations of albumins, globulins, and glutelin-3, and lower concentrations of prolamines. The combination of the opaque-2 and brittle-2 genes enhanced this difference. Although the four mutant genes are located on three different chromosomes, they exert a similar effect on endosperm protein composition. Five other starch-modifying mutants with high lysine content resemble the brittle-2 mutant in endosperm protein composition, when the gene is present either singly or combined with opaque-2. Therefore, the pattern of protein synthesis in all maize mutants with high lysine concentrations may be either identical or very similar. Because no synergistic effect on lysine concentration is obtained when floury-2 is combined with opaque-2, different pathways leading to reduced zein synthesis may exist in the floury and starch-modifying mutants with high lysine concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2014719187,"Electronic equipment allows fishes, by their spatial movements, to regulate the temperature in experimental tanks. Swimming into warmer water causes the temperature of the entire tank to increase; conversely, swimming into cooler water causes the temperature to decrease. The technique may be adapted for studying simultaneous behavioral regulation of temperature and nonthermal factors."

https://openalex.org/W2121032050,"Closure phase is a number measured by triplets of Michelson interferometers that is completely independent of certain types of otherwise severe instrumental errors. In the 30 years since closure phase was invented, it has been applied to a diverse number of different problems in astronomical imaging. Methods based on the closure phase now allow imaging of complex objects in the presence of severe aberrations and are vital to the success of modern, high-resolution astronomical imaging both at radio and at optical wavelengths. Over the past 10 to 15 years, the concept of closure phase has been extended and generalized. One of the most important advances has been the development of automatic or self-calibration techniques. This article reviews closure phase methods and some of the many spin-offs and related ideas."

https://openalex.org/W2012917832,Electron probe analysis of the earliest metal found at the northeastern Thailand site of Non Nok Tha indicates that it is a bronze containing 4 to 6 percent tin. Recent thermoluminescence dates substantiate the presence of a well-developed bronze technology prior to 2300 B.C. and suggest a date of about 2700 to 2500 B.C. for the first appearance of bronze at the site.
https://openalex.org/W1975394538,"In binary character-classification tasks, reaction time generally has been reported to increase substantially with the number of target elements. However, when the targets formed a familiar set and subjects were not required to make explicit ""no"" responses, reaction time did not increase significantly as the target set increased in size from one to three."
https://openalex.org/W2076043096,"The quantity and physical state of methane and nitrogen in the atmosphere of Neptune's satellite Triton and on the surface are evaluated by means of new telescopic data and laboratory measurements of these volatiles. Methane ice is seen in some spectral regions, indicating that the atmosphere is sufficiently transparent to permit sunlight penetration to the surface. Some of the molecular nitrogen absorption occurs in the atmosphere, though some must occur in condensed nitrogen (liquid or solid) on Triton's surface, or in a thin cloud of condensed nitrogen. The Voyager spacecraft cameras should see the surface of Triton."

The desired WLN are obtained simply by drawing the structures of the compounds of interest on a tablet, which is linked to an appropriately programmned computer."
https://openalex.org/W1983557277,"An industrial discharge of yellow phosphorus killed fish and crustaceans in Long Harbor, Placentia Bay, Newfoundland, in 1969. During subsequent toxicity studies various organs from lobsters killed by exposure to suspensions of yellow phosphorus were examined for histological damage. Anitennal gland and hepatopancreas both showed degenerative changes, and cellular damnage in the latter was extensive."
