In this study we demonstrate that mitochondrial autophagy is induced by hypoxia, that this process requires the hypoxia-dependent factor-1-dependent expression of BNIP3 and the constitutive expression of Beclin-1 and Atg5, and that in cells subjected to prolonged hypoxia, mitochondrial autophagy is an adaptive metabolic response which is necessary to prevent increased levels of reactive oxygen species and cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2054254705,"Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by a wide range of clinical signs. The location of lesions in the CNS is variable and is a crucial determinant of clinical outcome. Multiple sclerosis is believed to be mediated by myelin-specific T cells, but the mechanisms that determine where T cells initiate inflammation are unknown. Differences in lesion distribution have been linked to the HLA complex, suggesting that T cell specificity influences sites of inflammation. We demonstrate that T cells that are specific for different myelin epitopes generate populations characterized by different T helper type 17 (T(H)17) to T helper type 1 (T(H)1) ratios depending on the functional avidity of interactions between TCR and peptide-MHC complexes. Notably, the T(H)17:T(H)1 ratio of infiltrating T cells determines where inflammation occurs in the CNS. Myelin-specific T cells infiltrate the meninges throughout the CNS, regardless of the T(H)17:T(H)1 ratio. However, T cell infiltration and inflammation in the brain parenchyma occurs only when T(H)17 cells outnumber T(H)1 cells and trigger a disproportionate increase in interleukin-17 expression in the brain. In contrast, T cells showing a wide range of T(H)17:T(H)1 ratios induce spinal cord parenchymal inflammation. These findings reveal critical differences in the regulation of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord."

Although diabetes influences the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the role of this neuroendocrine system in diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction remains unexplored. Here we demonstrate that, in both insulin-deficient rats and insulin-resistant mice, diabetes impairs hippocampus-dependent memory, perforant path synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis, and the adrenal steroid corticosterone contributes to these adverse effects. Rats treated with streptozocin have reduced insulin and show hyperglycemia, increased corticosterone, and impairments in hippocampal neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity and learning. Similar deficits are observed in db/db mice, which are characterized by insulin resistance, elevated corticosterone and obesity. Changes in hippocampal plasticity and function in both models are reversed when normal physiological levels of corticosterone are maintained, suggesting that cognitive impairment in diabetes may result from glucocorticoid-mediated deficits in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity."

PTP1B overexpression in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of humans and rodents may contribute to insulin resistance and obesity. The mechanisms mediating PTP1B overexpression in obese and diabetic states have been unclear. We find that adipose tissue inflammation and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) regulate PTP1B expression in vivo. High fat feeding of mice increased PTP1B expression 1.5- to 7-fold in adipose tissue, liver, skeletal muscle, and arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus. PTP1B overexpression in high fat-fed mice coincided with increased adipose tissue expression of the macrophage marker CD68 and TNFα, which is implicated in causing obesity-induced insulin resistance. TNFα increased PTP1B mRNA and protein levels by 2- to 5-fold in a dose- and time-dependent manner in adipocyte and hepatocyte cell lines. TNFα administration in mice increased PTP1B mRNA 1.4- to 4-fold in adipose tissue, liver, skeletal muscle, and hypothalamic arcuate nucleus and PTP1B protein 2-fold in liver. Actinomycin D treatment blocked, and high dose salicylate treatment inhibited by 80%, TNFα-induced PTP1B expression in adipocyte cell lines, suggesting TNFα may induce PTP1B transcription via nuclear factor κB (NFκB) activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation from adipocyte cell lines and liver of mice demonstrated TNFα-induced recruitment of NFκB subunit p65 to the PTP1B promoter in vitro and in vivo. In mice with diet-induced obesity, TNFα deficiency also partly blocked PTP1B overexpression in adipose tissue. Our data suggest that PTP1B overexpression in multiple tissues in obesity is regulated by inflammation and that PTP1B may be a target of anti-inflammatory therapies.

According to current World Health Organization estimates, twice as many people worldwide suffer ill health effects from the accumulation of excess adipose mass (1.6 billion) than from malnutrition (800 million). Obesity contributes to the pathogenesis of many important human diseases, including type 2 diabetes and cancer (1Kopelman P.G. Nature. 2000; 404: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (3698) Google Scholar). Obesity is accompanied by resistance to insulin and leptin, key hormones regulating glucose homeostasis and body weight (2Saltiel A.R.

The molecular mechanisms underlying leptin and insulin resistance in obesity are not completely understood.

Similarly, PTP1B re-expression in liver of PTP1B-deficient mice leads to a marked attenuation of their enhanced insulin sensitivity (14Haj F.G. Zabolotny J.M. Kim Y.B. Kahn B.B. Neel B.G. J. Biol.

In humans, PTP1B polymorphisms are associated with insulin resistance, obesity, or other characteristics of the metabolic syndrome in some populations (3Dube N. Tremblay M.L. Biochim. Biophys.

In most studies, increased PTP1B expression in obese states correlates with increased PTP1B activity (20Dadke S.S. Li H.C. Kusari A.B. Begum N. Kusari J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Tyrosine phosphorylation, serine phosphorylation, oxidation, and sumoylation have been reported to regulate PTP1B activity (4Bourdeau A. Dube N. Tremblay M.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 32Dadke S. Cotteret S. Yip S.C. Jaffer Z.M. Haj F. Ivanov A. Rauscher 3rd, F. Shuai K. Ng T. Neel B.G. Chernoff J. Nat.

It also has been unclear how PTP1B expression is regulated in vivo. Accumulating evidence indicates that obesity is an inflammatory state, with elevation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 in adipose tissue or sera (33Pickup J.C. Crook M.A. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 34Wellen K.E. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Clin.

These cytokines are implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and may represent a causal link between obesity and diabetes (33Pickup J.C. Crook M.A. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 34Wellen K.E. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). Obesity-associated inflammation appears to be triggered by, and primarily involves, adipose tissue (36Weisberg S.P.

In humans and rodents, obesity-associated inflammation is evidenced by macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue, with macrophages constituting up to 50% of the cells in fat pads of obese rodents (36Weisberg S.P.

Adipose tissue is the source of increased levels of TNFα in obesity (38Kershaw E.E. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (3754) Google Scholar). Although macrophages are potent sources of pro-inflammatory cytokines, purified populations of isolated adipocytes have been shown to secrete TNFα (35Coppack S.W. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2001; 60: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 38Kershaw E.E. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (3754) Google Scholar). The triggers of adipose tissue inflammation are not fully understood, but may involve cytokine or chemokine secretion by adipocytes or endothelial cells as adipocyte hypertrophy and necrosis occurs (39Cinti S. Mitchell G. Barbatelli G. Murano I. Ceresi E. Faloia E. Wang S. Fortier M. Greenberg A.S. Obin M.S. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 2347-2355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). TNFα inhibits insulin action in vitro and in vivo by altering expression or activity of multiple proteins in the insulin-signaling pathway in cells (35Coppack S.W. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2001; 60: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 38Kershaw E.E. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (3754) Google Scholar, 40Qi C. Pekala P.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 223: 128-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, TNFα treatment decreases insulin-stimulated insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate tyrosine phosphorylation in cultured cells and tissues (40Qi C. Pekala P.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 223: 128-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Sethi J.K. Hotamisligil G.S. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 42Sykiotis G.P. Papavassiliou A.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The TNFα receptors TNFR1 (p55) and TNFR2 (p75) mediate the biological responses to TNFα and are expressed ubiquitously on cells (41Sethi J.K. Hotamisligil G.S. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 43Kracht M. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 2002; 20: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Presently it is unclear whether TNFα is an endocrine or mainly paracrine mediator of insulin resistance in obesity (35Coppack S.W. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2001; 60: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to identify factors that mediate PTP1B overexpression in insulin resistance, obesity, and diabetes. Our data confirm that PTP1B overexpression occurs in insulin-target tissues of several, but not all insulin-resistant, obese, and/or diabetic animal models, suggesting that factors other than insulin resistance, obesity, and diabetes regulate tissue PTP1B overexpression in vivo. Importantly, in mice with high fat diet-induced obesity, PTP1B overexpression in liver, adipose tissue, and muscle, as well as the arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus, coincides with increased expression of adipose tissue inflammatory markers and TNFα. TNFα treatment itself is sufficient to increase PTP1B mRNA and protein levels in cultured cells and insulin- and leptin-target tissues of mice, and TNFα deficiency partly blocks diet-induced PTP1B overexpression in adipose tissue. Inhibition of transcription or NFκB activation and chromatin immunoprecipitation from cells or tissues suggest TNFα induces PTP1B expression in part by transactivation by NFκB. Our data strongly suggest that the development of inflammation may be a unifying theme underlying tissue PTP1B overexpression in obesity and diabetes. Animals—Mice and rats were housed at 22 °C with a 12-h/12-h or 14-h/10-h light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum. Results are reported from random-fed mice on a standard rodent chow diet unless otherwise indicated. FVB mice were obtained from Taconic (Hudson, NY). Obese leptin-deficient mice (ob/ob) and lean littermate controls (+/+ or +/ob) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Obese, diabetic long form leptin receptor-deficient mice (db/db) and lean littermate controls (+/+ or +/db) with the Ks+ strain background were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Obese leptin-receptor mutant Zucker rats (fa/fa) and lean littermate controls (+/+ or +/fa) were obtained from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). Fed and 16-h fasted ob/ob and fa/fa and 16-h fasted db/db mice were examined with their respective lean controls. Homozygous TNFα-deficient (TNFα–/–) mice with a mixed genetic background of C57BL/6J and 129SvJ strains and wild-type F1 progeny of a C57BL/6J and 129SvJ mating were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. TNFα–/– mice were bred to the wild-type mice to generate TNFα+/– mice. TNFα+/– mice were inter-crossed to generate TNFα–/– and TNFα+/+ mice, which were genotyped according to the method provided by the supplier. For diet studies, mice were fed either rodent chow (6% fat by weight and 12% of calories from fat, RD8664 Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) or high fat diet (41% of calories from fat, 34% of calories from sucrose, TD88137 Harlan Teklad) for the indicated length of time. Body adiposity was determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptometry (DEXA, Lunar PIXImus mouse densitometer). All studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and were conducted in accordance with the principles and procedures outlined in the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Treatment of Mice with Glucocorticoids or TNFα—For glucocorticoid treatment to induce insulin resistance, male 14-week-old FVB mice were injected intraperitoneally once per day with saline or 3, 30, or 300 μg of dexamethasone for 4 days and sacrificed 5 h after the last injection in the random-fed state. Blood glucose levels were measured using a One Touch II glucometer (Lifescan Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Milpitas, CA). Serum insulin levels were determined with a rat insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using mouse insulin standards (Crystal Chem Inc., Chicago, IL). For TNFα injection experiments, random-fed female FVB mice at 8–9 weeks of age were used. For PTP1B RNA measurements, mice were injected intravenously with saline or 3.3 μg of murine TNFα (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and tissues were harvested from mice 4 h after injection. For PTP1B protein measurements, mice were injected intravenously with saline or 3.3 μg of murine TNFα, followed by a second intravenous injection of saline or TNFα 5 h later. Tissues were harvested from mice 9 h after the initial TNFα injection. Cell Culture and 3T3-L1 Adipocyte Differentiation—All tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) unless otherwise indicated. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium with 5% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. H-4-II-E cells were maintained in Alpha’s modification of Eagle media (Cellgro, Mediatech, Herndon, VA) with 5% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (obtained from the ATCC, #CCL 92.1, Rockville, MD) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium with 10% newborn calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Two days after reaching confluence, fibroblasts were induced to differentiate by treatment with 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 1 μg/ml insulin (all from Sigma) for 3 days. During and following differentiation, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were used for experiments 14–21 days after induction of differentiation and only if >90% of cells showed fat droplets. HeLa cells, H-4-II-E cells, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with murine TNFα (Sigma) for the doses and times indicated in the figure legends. For inhibitor studies, cells were incubated with actinomycin D (2 μg/ml, Sigma), sodium salicylate (5 mm, Sigma), PD98059 (10 μm, Calbiochem), SB202190 (10 μm, Sigma), SP600125 (5 μm, Sigma), or without inhibitor for 1–1.5 h, followed by incubation with 20 ng/ml (1.2 nm) mouse TNFα (Sigma) or without cytokine for 4 h. RNA Extraction and Gene Expression Analysis by Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from homogenized tissues and cultured cells using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) following the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed for each sample in triplicate with 2.5 ng of total RNA, 1× TaqMan Universal Master Mix no AmpErase UNG, 6.25 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (both from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and gene-specific primers-probe sets, using an MX4000 Multiplex Quantitative PCR System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Reverse transcription reactions were carried out at 48 °C for 30 min, reactions were then denatured at 95 °C for 10 min, and cDNAs were amplified by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Primers and probes for 18S (which detects human and mouse 18S RNA) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 have been previously described (44Koza R.A. Hohmann S.M. Guerra C. Rossmeisl M. Kozak L.P. J.

Primer-probe sets for human PTP1B, murine PTP1B, TNFα, macrophage antigen CD68, and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) were purchased as predesigned TaqMan gene expression assays and run as per the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was determined by the standard curve method and normalized to 18S RNA as indicated. When the 18S RNA amount differed between experimental groups, gene expression was normalized to HPRT RNA. Accuracy of RNA quantitation was optimized by gene-specific primer-probe sets that span intron-exon boundaries and lack of amplification in no-RT and no-template controls. Immunoblotting—Liver, perigonadal white adipose tissue, and hind limb skeletal muscle were dissected from mice and rats and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Lateral hypothalamus, medial hypothalamus (containing the ventromedial hypothalamus and dorsomedial hypothalamus), and arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus were punched out of a 2 mm coronal or sagittal brain slice encompassing the hypothalamic region and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues or cultured cells were homogenized in 20 mm Tris pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 1 min with a Polytron homogenizer, incubated at 4 °C for 40–60 min with rotation, and centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g. Supernatant protein (50 μg) was separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted (46Venable C.L. Frevert E.U. Kim Y.B. Fischer B.M. Kamatkar S. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. J. Biol.

To detect CD68 protein in adipose tissue lysates, 400 μg of protein was incubated with wheat germ agarose overnight and washed three times with lysis buffer, and then bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels and subjected to immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-mouse CD68 antibodies (Serotec, Raleigh, NC). Immunoblotted protein bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and quantified by densitometry using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics/Amersham Biosciences) or direct chemiluminescence detection with GeneGnome (SynGene, Frederick, MD). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Immunoprecipitation of NF-κB bound to PTP1B gene chromatin was accomplished using a two-step cross-linking method (47Nowak D.E. Tian B. Brasier A.R. BioTechniques. 2005; 39: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). ChIP assays were performed on day 14–21 post-differentiation 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with 20 ng/ml (1.2 nm) mouse TNFα (Sigma) or without cytokine for 4 h. ChIP assays were additionally performed on frozen livers of randomly fed 8–9-week-old female FVB mice harvested 4 h after intravenous injection of mice with saline or 3.3 μg of murine TNFα, as described above. After removal of media, adipocytes were washed three times with PBS prior to cross-linking. In addition, for adipocytes, all washing and cross-linking steps were carried out with the addition of 1 mm MgCl2 to aid cell retention on plates. Cells or finely minced livers were fixed in disuccinimidyl glutarate added to a final concentration of 2 mm in PBS for 45 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and then followed by fixation with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were washed three times in PBS and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS at room temperature and transferred to ice. Chromatin was sheared by sonication until average DNA length determined by gel electrophoresis was ∼500–3000 bp. Samples were centrifuged (5000 × g for 5 min), and soluble chromatin was transferred to a new tube.

https://openalex.org/W2162794208,"Here we report that in skeletal muscle cells the contribution to insulin resistance and inflammation of two common dietary long-chain fatty acids depends on the channeling of these lipids to distinct cellular metabolic fates. Exposure of cells to the saturated fatty acid palmitate led to enhanced diacylglycerol levels and the consequent activation of the protein kinase Cθ/nuclear factor κB pathway, finally resulting in enhanced interleukin 6 secretion and down-regulation of the expression of genes involved in the control of the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ-coactivator 1α) and triglyceride synthesis (acyl-coenzyme A: diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2). In contrast, exposure to the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate did not lead to these changes. Interestingly, co-incubation of cells with palmitate and oleate reversed both inflammation and impairment of insulin signaling by channeling palmitate into triglycerides and by up-regulating the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation, thus reducing its incorporation into diacylglycerol. Our findings support a model of cellular lipid metabolism in which oleate protects against palmitate-induced inflammation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells by promoting triglyceride accumulation and mitochondrial β-oxidation through PPARα- and protein kinase A-dependent mechanisms.

Insulin resistance is a major characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is also associated with obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (1DeFronzo R.A. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1991; 14: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (4169) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle accounts for most insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and is, therefore, the main site of insulin resistance. Impairment of glucose utilization and insulin sensitivity during this process has been related to the presence of high free fatty acids (FFA) 4The abbreviations used are: FFA, free fatty acids; PGC-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKCθ, protein kinase C θ; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; DAG, diacylglycerol; TG, triglyceride; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; DGAT, acyl-coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase. in plasma. Along these lines, several studies have consistently demonstrated that a rise in plasma FFA produces insulin resistance in both diabetic patients and non-diabetic subjects (2Boden G. Jadali F.

High FFA levels presumably increase FFA uptake, exceeding its oxidation, which in turn leads to increased intramuscular triglycerides and diacylglycerol (DAG), the latter being a potent allosteric activator of both conventional and novel PKC isoforms. Interestingly, it has been reported that the incubation of skeletal muscle cells with the saturated fatty acid palmitate results in the activation of PKCθ, which is the most abundant PKC isoform in skeletal muscle (6Griffin M.E. Marcucci M.J. Cline G.W. Bell K. Barucci N. Lee D. Goodyear L.J. Kraegen E.W. White M.F. Shulman G.I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 7Cortright R.N.

Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), leading to impaired insulin signaling. In addition, PKCθ has the unique ability among the PKC isoforms to activate pro-inflammatory NFκB (6Griffin M.E. Marcucci M.J. Cline G.W. Bell K. Barucci N. Lee D. Goodyear L.J. Kraegen E.W.

The activation of this pathway during insulin resistance supports a link between inflammation and type 2 diabetes (for review, see Ref. 14Wellen K.E. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (3196) Google Scholar). In fact, markers of inflammation, including pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL) 1, interferon-γ, and IL-6) have been reported to be high in type 2 diabetes (15Pickup J.C. Mattock M.B. Chusney G.D. Burt D. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 16Kern P.A. Ranganathan S. Li C. Wood L. Ranganathan G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 280: E745-E751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of these cytokines, IL-6 correlates most strongly with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (15Pickup J.C. Mattock M.B. Chusney G.D. Burt D. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 16Kern P.A. Ranganathan S. Li C. Wood L. Ranganathan G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

Ranganathan S. Li C. Wood L. Ranganathan G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 280: E745-E751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, recent evidence suggests that skeletal muscle cells generate IL-6 production when exposed to the saturated fatty acid palmitate (18Weigert C. Brodbeck K. Staiger H. Kausch C. Machicao F.

Interestingly, saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids differ significantly in their contribution to insulin resistance (20Schmitz-Peiffer C. Craig D.L. Biden T.J. J. Biol.

Thus, it is generally accepted that saturated fatty acids induce insulin resistance (21Vessby B. Uusitupa M. Hermansen K. Riccardi G. Rivellese A.A. Tapsell L.C. Nalsen C. Berglund L. Louheranta A.

However, the mechanisms by which enrichment with oleate favors insulin sensitivity are still unknown. The present study was designed to characterize the cellular mechanisms by which the two most common fatty acids, palmitate and oleate (26Gorski J. Nawrocki A. Murthy M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 178: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), exert their differential effects on fatty acid-induced impairment of insulin signaling and inflammation in skeletal muscle cells and to find whether oleate prevents the deleterious effects of palmitate. We report that the different effects of these fatty acids are related to their ability to promote DAG accumulation. Thus, exposure to palmitate increased DAG levels and activated the PKCθ-NFκB pathway, resulting in enhanced secretion of IL-6 and down-regulation of PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) and acyl-coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), enzyme that controls the rate of triglyceride (TG) synthesis from DAG. In contrast, co-incubation of palmitate-exposed cells with oleate reversed these changes by promoting TG accumulation and mitochondrial β-oxidation, thus preventing DAG synthesis and activation of the PKCθ-NFκB pathway. The different effects of these two fatty acids seem to be related to the ability of oleate to activate PPARα and protein kinase A (PKA). Reagents—Wy-14,643, H89, and MK886 were obtained from Sigma and GW501516 from Biomol Research Labs Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—Mouse C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. When cells reached confluence, the medium was switched to the differentiation medium containing DMEM and 2% horse serum, which was changed every other day. After 4 additional days, the differentiated C2C12 cells had fused into myotubes. Lipid-containing media were prepared by conjugation of FFA with FFA-free bovine serum albumin, using a method modified from that described by Chavez and Summers (27Chavez J.A. Summers S.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Briefly, FFAs were dissolved in ethanol and diluted 1:100 in DMEM containing 2% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Myotubes were incubated for 16 h in serum-free DMEM containing 2% bovine serum albumin in either the presence (FFA-treated cells) or absence (control cells) of FFAs. Cells were then incubated with 100 nm insulin for 10 min. Following incubation, RNA was extracted from myotubes as described below. Culture supernatants were collected, and the secretion of IL-6 was assessed by ELISA (Amersham Biosciences). Measurements of mRNA—Levels of mRNA were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), as previously described (28Coll T. Jove M. Rodriguez-Calvo R. Eyre E. Palomer X. Sanchez R.M. Merlos M. Laguna J.C. Vazquez-Carrera M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 2779-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated by using the Ultraspec reagent (Biotecx, Houston). The total RNA isolated by this method was undegraded and free of protein and DNA contamination. The sequences of the sense and antisense primers used for amplification were: Il-6, 5′-TCCAGCCAGTTGCCTTCTTGG-3′ and 5′-TCTGACAGTGCATCATCGCTG-3′; Pgc-1α, 5′-CCCGTGGATGAAGACGGATTG-3′ and 5′-GTGGGTGTGGTTTGCTGCATG-3′; Cpt-I, 5′-TATGTGAGGATGCTGCTTCC-3′ and 5′-CTCGGAGAGCTAAGCTTGTC-3′; Dgat1, 5′-GCGACGGCTACTGGGATCTGA-3′ and 5′-CAGGCCAGCTGTAGGGGTCCT-3′ and 5′-GAGGCCAGCTGTAGGGGTCCT-3′; Dgat2, 5′-ATGCCTGGCAAGAACGCAGTC-3′ and 5′-CAGAGGAGAAGAGGCCTCGGC-3′ and Aprt (adenosyl phosphoribosyl transferase), 5′-GCCTCTTGGCCAGTCACCTGA-3′ and 5′-CCAGGCTCACACACTCCACCA-3′. Amplification of each gene yielded a single band of the expected size (Il-6; 229 bp; Pgc-1α: 228 bp, Cpt-I: 629 bp; Dgat1: 219 bp; Dgat2: 226 bp and Aprt: 329 bp). Preliminary experiments were carried out with various amounts of cDNA to determine non-saturating conditions of PCR amplification for all the genes studied. Therefore, under these conditions, relative quantification of mRNA was assessed by the RT-PCR method described in this study (29Freeman W.M. Walker S.J. Vrana K.E. BioTechniques. 1999; 26 (+): 112Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Radioactive bands were quantified by video-densitometric scanning (Vilbert Lourmat Imaging). The results for the expression of specific mRNAs are always given in relation to the expression of the control gene (Aprt). Determination of Diacylglycerol Levels—Diacylglycerol and ceramide levels were determined by the diacylglycerol kinase method, as described elsewhere (28Coll T. Jove M. Rodriguez-Calvo R. Eyre E. Palomer X. Sanchez R.M. Merlos M. Laguna J.C. Vazquez-Carrera M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 2779-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Incorporation of [14C]FA into Lipid Fractions—Cells were incubated with [1-14C]palmitic acid and/or [1-14C]oleic acid for 16 h. The cell monolayers were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and the lipids were extracted twice with CHCl3/MeOH (2:1) and 0.1 m KOH. After drying under nitrogen stream, the lipid extract was re-dissolved in chloroform-methanol (2:1) and separated on thin-layer chromatography (TLC), using hexane-diethyl etheracetic acid (70:30:1). Plates were measured in a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). DAG and TG were identified by comparison with standards (Sigma) processed in parallel to the samples. Isolation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extract isolation and EMSA were performed as described elsewhere (28Coll T. Jove M. Rodriguez-Calvo R. Eyre E. Palomer X. Sanchez R.M. Merlos M. Laguna J.C. Vazquez-Carrera M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 2779-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—To obtain total proteins, C2C12 myotubes were homogenized in cold lysis buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5.4 μg/ml aprotinin). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method. Total and nuclear proteins (30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% separation gels and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies against total and phospho-PKCθ (Thr538), PKC-α/βII (Thr638/641) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), total (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and phospho-Akt (Ser473), total and phospho-IRS1 (Ser307) (Cell Signaling), IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PPARα, PPARβ/δ (provided by W. Wahli), and α-actin (Sigma). Detection was achieved using the EZ-ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek Ltd.). The equal loading of proteins was assessed by red phenol staining. The size of detected proteins was estimated using protein molecular mass standards (Invitrogen). Statistical Analyses—Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of six separate experiments. Significant differences were established by one-way analysis of variance using the computer program GraphPad Instat (GraphPad Software V2.03) (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). When significant variations were found, the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test was performed. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Oleate Prevents Palmitate-induced Insulin Resistance and IL-6 Secretion by Inhibiting the DAG-PKCθ-NFκB Pathway—As exposure of skeletal muscle cells to the saturated fatty acid palmitate leads to both phosphorylation of IRS-1 on serine residues and inhibition of insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, thereby attenuating insulin signaling (14Wellen K.E. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (3196) Google Scholar), we first evaluated whether oleate prevented these effects. As expected, insulin stimulated Akt phosphorylation, whereas this process was inhibited by 0.5 mm palmitate (Fig. 1A). However, no changes were observed when cells were exposed to the same concentration of oleate. Interestingly, co-incubation of palmitate-exposed cells with increasing concentrations of oleate (0.1 and 0.3 mm) prevented this effect in a concentration-dependent manner. Likewise, palmitate exposure enhanced Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Fig. 1B), whereas exposure to oleate did not, and co-incubation with oleate reversed the effect of the saturated fatty acid. Because phosphorylation of IRS1 on Ser307 after exposure of skeletal muscle cells to palmitate is mediated by DAG-mediated activation of PKCθ, we next assessed whether oleate prevented these changes. As previously reported (27Chavez J.A. Summers S.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), palmitate treatment led to enhanced DAG levels (Fig. 1C), whereas cells exposed to oleate showed DAG amounts similar to those observed in control cells. When palmitate-exposed cells were co-incubated with oleate, a concentration-dependent reduction was observed in the content of this complex lipid. Consistent with the changes in the levels of DAG, palmitate induced phosphorylation of PKCθ, unlike cells exposed to bovine serum albumin (Fig. 1D). However, oleate did not affect phospho-PKCθ levels, and co-supplementation of palmitate-treated cells with oleate prevented the phosphorylation of this PKC isoform. Palmitate-induced inflammation in skeletal muscle cells occurs through a mechanism involving NFκB activation by PKCθ (30Jove M. Planavila A. Sanchez R.M. Merlos M. Laguna J.C. Vazquez-Carrera M. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To determine whether oleate prevented palmitate-induced inflammation, we measured NFκB binding activity by EMSA. NFκB formed one complex with nuclear proteins (Fig. 2A). Specificity of the DNA binding complexes was assessed in competition experiments by adding an excess of unlabeled NFκB oligonucleotide. NFκB binding activity increased in nuclear extracts from palmitate-treated cells, whereas in those from oleate-exposed cells, the binding activity was similar to that observed in control cells. Notably, co-incubation of palmitate-treated cells with oleate reduced NFκB binding activity, especially at 0.3 mm. Addition of antibody against the p65 subunit of NFκB supershifted the complex, indicating that this band mainly consisted of this subunit. Further, the p50 subunit of NFκB was also present in this complex, although in minor quantities. No changes were observed in the DNA binding of nuclear proteins from control and palmitate-treated cells to an Oct-1 probe, indicating that the changes observed for the NFκB probe were specific (data not shown). NFκB is located in the cytosol bound to inhibitor κB(IκB), and palmitate supplementation causes phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, thus liberating and activating NFκB (18Weigert C. Brodbeck K.

Laguna J.C. Vazquez-Carrera M. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3087-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). When we examined the effects of the fatty acids on the protein levels of IκBα (Fig. 2B), we observed that palmitate caused a fall in its levels, whereas supplementation with oleate did not. Finally, in cells co-incubated with palmitate and oleate, a recovery was observed in the levels of this NFκB inhibitor, which is consistent with the reduction in NFκB binding activity. Palmitate-induced activation of NFκB in skeletal muscle cells results in enhanced expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such IL-6, that contribute to the development of insulin resistance (18Weigert C. Brodbeck K. Staiger H. Kausch C. Machicao F. Haring H.U. Schleicher E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23942-23952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 19Jove M. Planavila A. Laguna J.C. Vazquez-Carrera M. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3087-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Because co-incubation of palmitate-treated cells with oleate prevented activation of the DAG-PKCθ-NFκB pathway, we next explored whether oleate prevented palmitate-induced Il-6 expression and secretion. As Fig. 2C shows, palmitate strongly induced Il-6 mRNA levels, whereas supplementation with oleate showed expression levels similar to those observed in control cells. In addition, oleate supplementation prevented the increase in Il-6 expression caused by palmitate. The same pattern of expression was observed for TNF-α (Fig. 2D). Consistent with the changes in mRNA levels of Il-6, incubation with palmitate led to a 31-fold induction in the levels of IL-6 protein secreted into the culture media (control 7.7 ± 1.0 versus palmitate 241 ± 68 pg/ml, p < 0.001, Fig. 2E). Oleate did not significantly modify secretion of this interleukin (control 7.7 ± 1.0 versus oleate 10.9 ± 3.3 pg/ml), whereas oleate co-supplementation prevented the increase in IL-6 secretion caused by palmitate (74% reduction at 0.1 mm and 85% at 0.3 mm, p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 versus palmitate-treated cells, respectively). Overall, these findings indicate that oleate reverses palmitate-induced inflammation in skeletal muscle cells by preventing activation of the DAG-PKCθ-NFκB pathway. Oleate Reduces Palmitate-mediated DAG Accumulation by Promoting Triglyceride Synthesis and Fatty Acid Oxidation—Because DAG accumulation in skeletal muscle cells exposed to palmitate is the first step leading to palmitate-induced insulin resistance and inflammation, we explored the potential mechanisms by which oleate prevents the accumulation of this complex lipid. Incubation of cells exposed to palmitate and oleate with a diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor did not result in changes in Il-6 mRNA levels, suggesting that oleate did not affect DAG degradation (data not shown). On the other hand, it has been reported that palmitate and oleate are differentially utilized by myotubes (18Weigert C. Brodbeck K. Staiger H. Kausch C. Machicao F. Haring H.U. Schleicher E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23942-23952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas saturated fatty acid seems to be incorporated into TG and DAG, monounsaturated fatty acid is channeled toward TG (31Montell E. Turini M. Marotta M. Roberts M. Noe V. Ciudad C.J. Mace K. Gomez-Foix A.M. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 280: E229-E237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When we analyzed the incorporation of palmitate, oleate, and the mixture of these two fatty acids into DAG and TG (Fig. 3A), we found that the saturated fatty acid was mainly incorporated into DAG and TG (the TG:DAG ratio expressed as percentage of total radioactivity was 16:1), the monounsaturated fatty acid was incorporated mainly into TG (TG/DAG ratio was 273:1, 17 times greater induction than palmitate), whereas cells exposed to both palmitate and oleate were incorporated more into TG (TG/DAG ratio was 88:1, 5.5 times greater than cells exposed only to palmitate). These differences in the channeling of fatty acids into TG and DAG may be caused by changes either in the expression of genes involved in TG synthesis or in fatty acid oxidation. Given that DGAT is the enzyme that catalyzes the final reaction in the synthesis of TG from DAG, we assessed the effects of palmitate and oleate on the expression of this gene. Fatty acids did not affect the expression of Dgat1 (Fig. 3B). However, Dgat2 mRNA levels were lower in cells exposed to palmitate (36% reduction, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3C), whereas oleate did not affect the expression of this gene and supplementation of palmitate-exposed cells with oleate prevented the effect of the saturated fatty acid. This finding suggests that the channeling of palmitate into DAG may be the result of a reduction in the expression of Dgat2, whereas supplementation with oleate restores both the expression of this gene and TG synthesis. We also evaluated whether additional mechanisms may account for the effects of oleate on DAG levels. Because up-regulation in the expression of genes involved in the oxidation of fatty acids may reduce their availability for DAG synthesis (32Sebastian D. Herrero L. Serra D. Asins G. Hegardt F.G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 292: E677-E686Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we focused on the expression of genes, such as Pgc-1α and Cpt-I. The former is a co-activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) involved in the control of fatty acid oxidation (33Finck B.N. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar), whereas the second allows the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria for β-oxidation (34Mascaro C. Acosta E. Ortiz J.A. Marrero P.F. Hegardt F.G. Haro D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8560-8563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous studies (28Coll T. Jove M. Rodriguez-Calvo R. Eyre E. Palomer X. Sanchez R.M. Merlos M. Laguna J.C. Vazquez-Carrera M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 2779-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we observed a reduction in the mRNA levels of Pgc-1α in cells exposed to palmitate, whereas oleate did not affect the expression of this gene (Fig. 3D). When cells exposed to palmitate were co-supplemented with oleate, no changes were observed in the levels of Pgc-1α. Nor did palmitate treatment significantly affect Cpt-I mRNA levels. However, cells exposed to oleate and those treated with palmitate co-supplemented with oleate showed a 7-times greater induction (p < 0.001) in the transcript levels of Cpt-I (Fig. 3E). Oleate Increases the DNA Binding Activity of PPAR—The expression of both Pgc-1α (35Hondares E. Mora O. Yubero P. Rodriguez de la C.M. Iglesias R. Giralt M. Villarroya F.

EMSA were performed to examine the interaction of PPARs with its cis-regulatory element using a 32P-labeled PPRE (peroxisome proliferator response element) probe and nuclear extracts from C2C12 myotubes exposed to different fatty acids. The PPRE probe formed a single main complex with nuclear proteins (Fig. 4A). Competition studies performed with a molar excess of unlabeled probe revealed that this complex represented a specific PPRE-protein interaction. Nuclear extracts from skeletal muscle cells incubated with 20 μm Wy-14,643, a selective PPARα activator at this concentration (37Kliewer S.A. Forman B.M. Blumberg B. Ong E.S. Borgmeyer U.

In this study, we profiled the expression of miRNA during myogenesis, from proliferating myoblasts through to terminally differentiated myotubes. Microarray results identified six significantly differentially expressed miRNA that were more than 2-fold different in myotubes. From this list, miRNA-26a (miR-26a), an up-regulated miRNA, was further examined. Overexpression of miR-26a in murine myogenic C2C12 cells induced creatine kinase activity, an enzyme that markedly increases during myogenesis.

Through a bioinformatics approach, we identified the histone methyltransferase, Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), as a potential target of miR-26a. Overexpression of miR-26a suppressed the activity of a luciferase reporter construct fused with the 3′-untranslated region of Ezh2. In addition, miR-26a overexpression decreased Ezh2 mRNA expression.

They are thought to target the expression of approximately one-third of all mammalian genes (1Kim V.N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar, 2Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9882) Google Scholar). miRNA are derived from endogenous transcribed RNA hairpin structures found within introns, exons, or intergenic regions of the genome (3Lagos-Quintana M. Rauhut R. Meyer J. Borkhardt A. Tuschl T. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2003; 9: 175-179Google Scholar). The biogenesis of the 19–24-nucleotide mature miRNA involves a two-step cleavage process by two ribonuclease III enzymes (4Lee Y. Jeon K. Lee J.T. Kim S. Kim V.N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4663-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, Drosha releases the precursor miRNA from its primary transcript, and the precursor, a hairpin-type structure, is then exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm by the Exportin-5/Ran complex (5Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Radmark O. Kim S. Kim V.N. Nature. 2003; 425: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3992) Google Scholar, 6Lund E. Guttinger S. Calado A. Dahlberg J.E. Kutay U. Science. 2004; 303: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). Once in the cytoplasm, Dicer cleaves the hairpin structure to release the double-stranded mature miRNA, which possesses a 3′-hydroxl and 5′-phosphate overhang (7Ketting R.F. Fischer S.E. Bernstein E. Sijen T. Hannon G.J. Plasterk R.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2654-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 8Hutvagner G. McLachlan J. Pasquinelli A.E. Balint E. Tuschl T. Zamore P.D. Science. 2001; 293: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar). This cleavage product is then detected by the miRNA ribonucleoprotein complex, where the less stable strand is incorporated into the complex and guided to its target sequence (9Mourelatos Z. Dostie J. Paushkin S. Sharma A. Charroux B. Abel L. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Sequence homology between the miRNA and its target, typically located in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of an mRNA transcript, directs the fate of the target transcript such that identical base pairing results in RNA-induced silencing complex-mediated mRNA cleavage (10Zeng Y. Yi R. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9779-9784Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), whereas imperfect base pairing results in post-initiation translational repression of the mRNA target (11Olsen P.H. Ambros V. Dev.

However, exceptions are increasingly evident as several studies have demonstrated that imperfect pairing of a miRNA to an mRNA target can also result in mRNA cleavage (14Yekta S. Shih I.H.

As a result of the imperfect complementarity between a miRNA and its mRNA target, it is predicted that most miRNA can potentially post-transcriptionally repress a large number of mRNA. More recently, it has also been suggested that miRNA can increase turnover of target mRNA by directing their rapid deadenylation (16Wu L. Fan J. Belasco J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4034-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar) and decapping (17Eulalio A. Rehwinkel J. Stricker M. Huntzinger E. Yang S.F. Doerks T. Dorner S. Bork P. Boutros M. Izaurralde E.

Regardless of the mechanism by which post-transcriptional gene silencing occurs, the continuous identification of bioinformatically predicted and experimentally validated miRNA suggests that they play important and diverse biological roles in most eukaryotic species. Such roles include developmental timing (18Reinhart B.J. Slack F.J. Basson M. Pasquinelli A.E. Bettinger J.C. Rougvie A.E. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G.

The potential involvement of miRNA in the regulation of myogenesis was first suggested by muscle-specific expression of miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-206 (3Lagos-Quintana M. Rauhut R. Meyer J. Borkhardt A. Tuschl T. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2003; 9: 175-179Google Scholar, 30Sempere L.F. Freemantle S. Pitha-Rowe I. Moss E. Dmitrovsky E. Ambros V.

Subsequent studies demonstrated that miR-1 overexpression in HeLa cells caused the direct or indirect down-regulation of more than 100 mRNA transcripts and altered the global expression profile of these cells to resemble that of muscle (32Lim L.P. Lau N.C. Garrett-Engele P. Grimson A. Schelter J.M. Castle J. Bartel D.P. Linsley P.S. Johnson J.M. Nature. 2005; 433: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (4007) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although miR-1 Drosophila knock-out larvae developed normal musculature, they died as small second instar larvae due to severe muscular deformity, indicating that miR-1 is not involved in muscle formation but rather in the maintenance of differentiation (31Sokol N.S. Ambros V. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2343-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In the mouse myoblast cell line C2C12, miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-206 promote myoblast differentiation (15Kim H.K. Lee Y.S. Sivaprasad U. Malhotra A. Dutta A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 27Chen J.F. Mandel E.M. Thomson J.M. Wu Q. Callis T.E. Hammond S.M. Conlon F.L. Wang D.Z. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar). Recently, it was also demonstrated that Dicer plays an essential role in skeletal muscle development (33O'Rourke J.R. Georges S.A. Seay H.R. Tapscott S.J. McManus M.T. Goldhamer D.J. Swanson M.S. Harfe B.D. Dev. Biol. 2007; 311: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These results suggest that miRNA regulate myogenesis at various stages by silencing genes that repress the differentiation process. To further investigate this hypothesis, we profiled miRNA expression during myogenesis of the mouse myoblast cell line, C2C12. These cells have been extensively studied and differentiate into myotubes under specific culture conditions (34Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). From the identified differentially expressed miRNA, we further examined the role of miR-26a in regulating myogenesis. Using a specific bioinformatics approach, we predicted and then experimentally tested a potential target of miR-26a, Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), a negative regulator of myogenesis. Cell Culture—The C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line, first derived from adult mouse dystrophic muscle (34Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar), was acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Myoblasts were maintained in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine. Once confluent, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum and 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine to promote myoblast differentiation into myocytes and subsequent fusion into multinucleated myotubes. Immunoblotting and Immunofluorescence Localizations—Total cellular protein (30 μg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and standard immunoblotting techniques (35Khanna K.K. Beamish H. Yan J. Hobson K. Williams R. Dunn I. Lavin M.F. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 609-618PubMed Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies and titers were used: anti-desmin (antibody D1033, Sigma-Aldrich, 1/5000) and anti-Ezh2 (antibody 4905, Cell Signaling, 1/500). Immunoreactive bands were detected using species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Chemicon, 1/3000) and visualized using the Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, Quantum Scientific). For immunofluorescence localization studies, C2C12 cells grown on coverslips were fixed in cold methanol at various differentiation time points (36Wong C.F. Barnes L.M. Smith L. Popa C.

Immunolocalizations used antibodies against desmin (Sigma-Aldrich, diluted 1/100) and Ezh2 (catalog number 36-6300, Invitrogen, diluted 1/50). Desmin localization was visualized using an anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (AQ326F, Chemicon, diluted, 1/150), and Ezh2 localization was visualized using an anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 555-conjugated antibody (A21429, Invitrogen, diluted 1/100). The nuclei of the cells were visualized using DAPI staining. Creatine Kinase Activity Assay—C2C12 cells were harvested in 50 mm Tris-Mes buffer (pH 7.8) containing 1% v/v Triton X-100 and stored at -80 °C. To measure creatine kinase enzyme activity, 100 μl of N-acetyl cysteine (TR14010, Thermo Electron Corp.) was added to 5 μl of cell extracts and absorbance read at 340 nm every 20 s over 5 min. The rate of reaction over this period was linear and used as the measure of enzyme activity normalized to total protein concentration (i.e. specific enzyme activity; units/mg). Isolation of Total RNA—Total RNA was isolated from C2C12 cells at the following time points: proliferating (70–80% confluence), confluent (100% confluence), 1 day (+1d), 2 days (+2d), and 4 days (+4d) (see Figs. 1 and 4) after induction of differentiation. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The purity and concentration of the RNA was determined by measuring its absorbance at 260 and 280 nm.FIGURE 4Ezh2 is a target for miR-26a in C2C12 cells. a, expression of Ezh2 mRNA during myogenesis, as measured by qRT-PCR.

Grocock R.J. van Dongen S. Bateman A. Enright A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D140-D144Crossref PubMed Scopus (3656) Google Scholar, 38Griffiths-Jones S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D109-D111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The microarray contains probes for 1488 mature miRNA, each represented twice on the microarray. Since the mature sequence of an miRNA is highly conserved between species, it is possible that cross-species hybridization could occur. However, the locked-nucleic acid miRNA probes are highly sensitive and optimized to minimize cross-hybridization between similar mature miRNA (39Castoldi M. Schmidt S. Benes V. Noerholm M. Kulozik A.E. Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2006; 12: 913-920Google Scholar). The Adelaide Microarray Facility (University of Adelaide, South Australia) printed the microarray slides and hybridized the samples. The reference RNA (see Fig. 1, reference) consisted of a pool of total RNA isolated from four independent proliferating C2C12 samples. Each time point was represented by four biological replicates, of which two were labeled with Cy3 and two were labeled with Cy5 according to a standard protocol (39Castoldi M. Schmidt S. Benes V. Noerholm M. Kulozik A.E. Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2006; 12: 913-920Google Scholar). For each sample, 1 μg of total RNA was labeled and hybridized to the microarray. Microarrays were scanned on a ScanArray 4000 XL scanner (Packard BioChip Technologies), and raw data were extracted using Spot software (40Wilson D.L. Buckley M.J. Helliwell C.A. Wilson I.W. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2003; 19: 1325-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Data were subsequently analyzed using GeneSpring® version 7.2 (Agilent Technologies), and statistical analysis was performed using background-corrected mean signal intensities from each dye channel. Microarray data were normalized using intensity-dependent global normalization (Lowess). Differentially expressed miRNA were identified using one-way analysis of variance (p < 0.05) and the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate with Tukey's honestly significant differences post hoc test to minimize selection of false positives. Of the significantly differentially expressed miRNA, only those with greater than 2-fold increase or 2-fold decrease in expression at any time point when compared with the proliferating sample were used for further analysis. This conservative approach focused on significantly differentially expressed miRNA that showed the greatest changes in expression during myogenesis. All microarray data presented in this manuscript are in accordance with Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME) guidelines and have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GEO data base (accession number: GSE9449). To further analyze differentially expressed miRNA, hierarchical gene-tree clustering and K-means clustering analysis, both using default parameters, were used to group miRNA with similar expression profiles (41Hartigan J. Wang M. Appl. Stat. 1979; 28: 100-108Crossref Google Scholar). Taqman® miRNA Expression Assays—RNA was reverse-transcribed using specific miRNA stem-loop primers (42Chen C. Ridzon D.A. Broomer A.J. Zhou Z. Lee D.H. Nguyen J.T. Barbisin M. Xu N.L. Mahuvakar V.R. Andersen M.R. Lao K.Q. Livak K.J. Guegler K.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4062) Google Scholar) and the Taqman® miRNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Mature miRNA expression was measured with Taqman® microRNA assays (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression of the miRNA was normalized against the expression level of the house-keeping gene, RpPO (NM_007475) or GAPDH (NM_008084), and presented as the mean normalized expression. Construction of Expression Plasmids—The following primer pair was used to clone the mouse miR-26a precursor into the pSilencer™ 4.1-CMV vector (Ambion, Geneworks) according to the manufacturer's instructions: miR-26a 5′-GGATCCGCAGAAACTCCAGAGAGAAGGA-3′;3′-AAGCTTGCCTTTAGCAGAAAGGAGGTT-5′. Primers contained 5′-BamHI and 3′-HindIII restriction sites (underlined) to facilitate cloning into the vector. The following primers were used to amplify and clone the 3′-UTR of mouse Ezh2 into the pMIR-REPORT™ luciferase vector (Ambion, Geneworks) according to manufacturer's instructions: 5′-ATACGCGTCTTGACATCTACTACCTCTTC-3′; 3′-ATAAGCTTACAAGTTCAAGTATTCTTTA-5′. The forward primer includes a MluI restriction site, and the reverse primer has a HindIII site (underlined) to facilitate ligation into the vector. The predicted miR-26a binding site (TACTTGAA, italicized) located in the 3′-UTR of Ezh2 was mutated by a single base pair change (underlined) using DpnI mediated site-directed mutagenesis (43Fisher C.L. Pei G.K. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Primers used for this procedure were as follows: 5′-GAATAAAGAATGCTTGAACTTG-3′;3′-CAAGTTCAAGCATTCTTTATTC-5′. The inserts from all cloned plasmids were sequenced by the Australian Genome Research Facility (Queensland, Australia) to verify identities. Transfections—For miRNA overexpression studies, C2C12 myoblasts were seeded at a cell density of 2.0 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates with OptiMEM® I medium (Invitrogen) 1 day prior to transfection. The following day, cells were transfected with expression plasmids using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each reaction consisted of 5 μg of expression plasmid DNA (pSilencer™ expression plasmid expressing miR-26a or a scrambled siRNA hairpin control with no homology to any known sequences in the human, mouse, or rat genomes) and 12.5 μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000. To visualize the transfection, an expression plasmid coding for red fluorescent protein was co-transfected in a 1:4 ratio to the pSilencer™ expression plasmid. The transfection reagents were removed after 4 h and replaced with growth medium. Cells were harvested for subsequent assays 48 h after transfection. Transfections of C2C12 myoblasts were also performed in a 96-well plate for creatine kinase activity assays using 0.3 μg of pSilencer™ expression plasmid encoding miR-26a or a scrambled control and 0.75 μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000. In addition, C2C12 myoblasts transfected with these plasmids were also induced to differentiate by changing the growth medium to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum and 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine. The cells were then visualized by immunofluorescence staining of desmin. For luciferase reporter assays, 5 × 103 cells were initially plated in a 96-well plate. Constructs were transfected into the C2C12 myoblasts at the following concentrations: 0.3 μg of reporter gene (Ezh2-Luc or Ezh2mut-Luc), 0.1 μg of β-galactosidase control plasmid, and 0.1 μg of pSilencer™ expression plasmid encoding miR-26a or a scrambled control. Transfections were performed in triplicate, and the experiment repeated three times. Twenty-four hours after transfection, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured using the DualLight® assay system (Applied Biosystems). Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency by measuring β-galactosidase control activity according to the manufacturer's instructions. For miR-26a inhibition assays, 5 × 104 C2C12 myoblasts were plated in a 24-well plate. Cells were transfected with either the miRIDIAN™ microRNA inhibitor designed against miR-26a or the scrambled sequence negative control (C-310118-04 or IN-001000-01, respectively; Dharmacon, Millennium Science). The inhibitor or control were both transfected into cells (250 ng) using Lipofectamine 2000, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and assayed for creatine kinase activity, myogenin, and myoD mRNA expression. Direct transfection of the miRIDIAN™ microRNA inhibitor into C2C12 myotubes was not possible. Statistical significance of results was calculated using the Student's t test, where p < 0.05 was considered significant. Identification of Putative mRNA Targets for miRNA Up-regulated during Myogenesis—mRNA targets for miRNA significantly up-regulated during myogenesis were predicted using the computer programs PicTar (44Krek A. Grun D. Poy M.N. Wolf R. Rosenberg L. Epstein E.J. Macmenamin P. da Piedade I. Gunsalus K.C. Stoffel M. Rajewsky N. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar), miRanda (45John B. Enright A.J. Aravin A. Tuschl T. Sander C. Marks D.S.

Cell. 2003; 115: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar). To minimize the number of false predictions, only mRNA targets predicted using all three programs were considered. Predicted mRNA targets of miRNA were then compared with mRNA that were significantly down-regulated during C2C12 differentiation (47Tomczak K.K. Marinescu V.D. Ramoni M.F. Sanoudou D. Montanaro F. Han M. Kunkel L.M. Kohane I.S. Beggs A.H. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 403-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)—The qRT-PCR procedure has been previously described (48Vuocolo T. Byrne K. White J. McWilliam S. Reverter A. Cockett N.E. Tellam R.L. Physiol. Genomics. 2007; 28: 253-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene, GAPDH, which remained constant throughout the experiment (49Berry F.B. Miura Y. Mihara K. Kaspar P. Sakata N. Hashimoto-Tamaoki T. Tamaoki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25057-25065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The primers used for qRT-PCR to quantitate mRNA expression in C2C12 cells were as follows: Ezh2, 5′-GAAAAAGGACGGCTCCTCTAA-3′, 3′-CATGGACACTGTTTGGTGTTG-5′; GAPDH, 5′-CCTGGAGAAACCTGCCAAGT-3′, 3′-AGCCGTATTCATTGTCATACCA-5′; myoD, 5′-CATCCCTAAGCGACACAGAAC-3′, 3′-AGCACCTGATAAATCGCATTG-5′; and myogenin, 5′-GCAGGCTCAAGAAAGTGAATG-3′, 3′-TAGGCGCTCAATGTACTGGAT-5′. Four technical replicates were used for each assay. miRNA Are Differentially Expressed during Myogenesis—Expression profiles of miRNA during C2C12 differentiation were examined using a commercial miRNA microarray that contained all miRNA present in the miRBase miRNA registry release 8.1 (37Griffiths-Jones S. Grocock R.J. van Dongen S. Bateman A. Enright A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D140-D144Crossref PubMed Scopus (3656) Google Scholar, 38Griffiths-Jones S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D109-D111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression patterns of miRNA at confluence, 1, 2, and 4 days after induction of differentiation were compared with proliferating myoblasts (reference myoblasts) (Fig. 1a). Each time point was represented by four independent biological samples. Microarray analysis revealed that six miRNA were significantly differentially expressed by greater than 2-fold during the course of myogenesis (Fig. 1b). Five miRNA (miR-133a/miR-133b, mml-miR-133a (Macaca mulatta miR133a), miR-206, miR-26a, and miR-422b) were up-regulated, and one was down-regulated (miR-222). Using the default K-means clustering analysis in GeneSpring® version 7.2 (Agilent Technologies), the differentially expressed miRNA were grouped into three clusters (Fig. 1c). Cluster I represents a group of three miRNA that were rapidly up-regulated as C2C12 cells committed to myogenesis. This cluster of miRNA contains miR-206, miR-133a/miR-133b, and mml-miR-133a, a shorter form of miR-133a from M. mulatta that differs in sequence by one base. miR-133a and miR-133b are located at different genetic loci and differ in their mature sequences by one nucleotide in their 3′-ends. These miRNA were previously shown to be highly expressed in skeletal muscle (30Sempere L.F. Freemantle S. Pitha-Rowe I. Moss E. Dmitrovsky E. Ambros V.

Using a genetic screen, we identified two novel cytosolic proteins, Fra1 and Fra2, that are part of a complex that interprets the signal derived from mitochondrial Fe-S synthesis. We found that mutations in FRA1 (YLL029W) and FRA2 (YGL220W) led to an increase in transcription of the iron regulon. In cells incubated in high iron medium, deletion of either FRA gene results in the translocation of the low iron-sensing transcription factor Aft1 into the nucleus, where it occupies the FET3 promoter. Deletion of either FRA gene has the same effect on transcription as deletion of both genes and is not additive with activation of the iron regulon due to loss of mitochondrial Fe-S cluster synthesis. These observations suggest that the FRA proteins are in the same signal transduction pathway as Fe-S cluster synthesis. We show that Fra1 and Fra2 interact in the cytosol in an iron-independent fashion. The Fra1-Fra2 complex binds to Grx3 and Grx4, two cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxins, in an iron-independent fashion. These results show that the Fra-Grx complex is an intermediate between the production of mitochondrial Fe-S clusters and transcription of the iron regulon.

These results show that the Fra-Grx complex is an intermediate between the production of mitochondrial Fe-S clusters and transcription of the iron regulon. Iron is an essential element required for all eukaryotes and most prokaryotes. Iron is also potentially dangerous, since it can participate in the generation of toxic oxygen molecules, such as superoxide anion and the hydroxyl radical. Iron transport is highly regulated in all species, and iron transporters are only expressed under conditions of iron need. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of iron transport systems occurs in all organisms ranging from yeast to humans. Consequently, iron acquisition in all species is tightly controlled and is coordinated with iron use. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses two different high affinity iron transport systems. One system is composed of a closely related family of four siderophore transporters. Siderophores are small organic molecules that exhibit an extremely high affinity (Kd = 10–33) for iron (1Van Ho A. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 237-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Although S. cerevisiae does not synthesize siderophores, it can accumulate siderophores produced by other organisms. The second high affinity iron transport system mediates the acquisition of ionic iron and is composed of a cell surface multicopper oxidase, Fet3, and a transmembrane permease, Ftr1. The multicopper oxidase converts Fe2+ to Fe3+, which is then transported by the transmembrane permease. The transcriptional activator Aft1 regulates both high affinity iron transport systems (2Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Aft1 is cytosolic when cells are iron-replete, but under conditions of iron depletion, Aft1 translocates into the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of ∼20 genes (3Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These genes, referred to as the iron regulon, include the siderophore transporters, the high affinity iron transport system, FET3 and FTR1, and genes involved in the assembly of the high affinity iron transport system as well as genes involved in iron-based metabolism and their regulation. There is a second transcription factor, Aft2, which is a paralogue of Aft1. When overexpressed, Aft2 can also affect transcription of the iron regulon, although deletion of AFT2 alone has little effect on iron transport and metabolism (4Blaiseau P.L. Lesuisse E. Camadro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34221-34226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 5Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It is clear that translocation of Aft1 into the nucleus and transcription of the iron regulon responds to cellular iron deprivation. We recently suggested that Aft1 does not respond directly to iron but rather to the production of iron-sulfur clusters within mitochondria. This conclusion was based on the observation that defects in mitochondrial Fe-S cluster synthesis induce transcription of the iron regulon even in cells that are iron-replete (6Chen O.S. Crisp R.J. Valachovic M. Bard M. Winge D.R. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29513-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Aft1, however, does not appear to be an Fe-S cluster-containing protein (6Chen O.S. Crisp R.J. Valachovic M. Bard M. Winge D.R. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29513-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Deletion of genes required for the assembly of cytosolic Fe-S cluster-containing proteins does not lead to activation of the iron regulon (7Rutherford J.C. Ojeda L. Balk J. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10135-10140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism by which mitochondrial Fe-S cluster synthesis affects the iron regulon is unclear. In this paper, we present a genetic test of the hypothesis that mitochondrial Fe-S cluster synthesis is involved in regulating the iron regulon by screening for mutants that would activate the iron regulon even in the presence of high media iron. Analysis of the mutants demonstrated that most were defective in genes required for mitochondrial Fe-S cluster synthesis. Two novel genes were identified that encode nonmitochondrial proteins that are required for regulation of Aft1-mediated expression of the iron regulon.

The integrants were further selected by uracil prototrophy. The diploid was sporulated and dissected to create the yeast strains OCY354, OCY355, OCY356, and OCY357. Genetic Screen and Identification of Mutants—Wild type yeast cells with the FET3-lacZ reporter integrated at the HO locus, OCY356 and OCY357, were plated on YPD supplemented with 50 μm iron (Fe2SO4) and mutagenized by UV to reach a 50% reduction in viability. After 3 days of growth at 30 °C, colonies were replicated to nylon membranes. Cells were disrupted by liquid nitrogen, and X-gal, a substrate for β-galactosidase, was added on top of the membrane. Membranes were incubated at 30 °C for 16 h, and the development of blue color indicated FET3 expression. Mutants that developed blue color were collected. Recessive mutants attributed to a single gene mutation were subjected to a genomic library screen by complementation analysis. A wild type genomic library constructed in YCp50 (ATCC catalog number 37415) was used for all library screens in this study. Complementing library clones were rescued, and library inserts were determined by DNA sequencing. If the insert contained multiple open reading frames, the responsible gene was determined by subcloning each of the open reading frames. Targeted Gene Deletion—Deletion of FRA1 (YLL029W) or FRA2 (YGL220W) was accomplished, utilizing the homozygous deletion collection (Research Genetics, Inc.) as a PCR template. Specific A and D primers for each gene disruption were obtained from the Saccharyomyces Genome Deletion Project. PCR DNA was transformed into diploid DY150 × DY1457, with or without the FET3-lacZ reporter integrated in the genome, or in the diploid OCY355 × OCY356 containing the integrated FET3-lacZ reporter. Disruption of genes was verified by PCR. Diploids, heterozygous for the disruption, were sporulated and dissected to generate the gene deletion in a haploid. The haploid gene deletion was confirmed by PCR. Plasmid DNA Construction—FRA1 was subcloned from a library clone pIF17B, composed of 78944–90188 of chromosome 12. BspHI digestion released a 4870-bp fragment containing the FRA1 open reading frame and 0.5 kb of the 5′ and 2 kb of the 3′-flanking region. The fragment was blunt-ended using Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, large (Klenow) fragment (New England Biolabs), and the 5′-phosphate group was removed by alkaline phosphatase (New England BioLabs). The fragment was cloned into YCp33. To create a gap-repaired plasmid for rescuing the fra1-1 allele, a BstEII/AfeI fragment was removed from the FRA1 subclone described above. The resulting fragment was transformed into the fra1-1 mutant, and the rescued allele was sequenced. N-terminal and C-terminal YFP fragments (a kind gift of Colin Duckett) were subjected to PCR and subcloned into the yeast expression vector YCp pCM189 (URA or LEU) under the control of the doxycycline-regulated tetO7 promoter (8Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Grx4 was fused to a linker sequence (RSIAT) and YFPN-(1–155) or YFPN-(1–155) and a linker sequence (GSANSSIDLISVPVDSRAV) via homologous recombination in pCM189 (URA), yielding pGrx4YN and pYNGrx4, respectively. Fra2 was fused to a linker sequence (RPACKIPNDLKQKVMNH) and YFPC-(156–239) or YFPC-(156–239) and a linker sequence (GSANSSIDLISVPVDSRAV) via homologous recombination in pCM189 (LEU), yielding pFra2YC and pYCFra2, respectively. Four additional constructs were generated by exchanging Fra2 for Grx4 and Grx4 for Fra2 in the above constructs (yielding pFra2YN, pYNFra2, pGrx4YC, and pYCGrx4, respectively). A c-Myc-tagged Grx4-Fis1 fusion protein was prepared as follows. FIS1 was excised as a BamHI/SalI fragment from plasmid B1607 (generously provided by J. M. Shaw) and inserted into pRS416-MET25. A three-c-Myc tag-GRX4 fragment flanked with SpeI-BamHI sites was generated by overlapping PCR technique and then inserted into pRS416-MET25-FIS1. Plasmid CM1089 GRX4-c-MYC has been described previously (9Ojeda L. Keller G. Muhlenhoff U. Rutherford J.C. Lill R. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17661-17669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). All plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Bacteria and Yeast Transformation—For rescuing plasmid DNA from yeast, total cellular DNA was extracted and transformed into DH10β (Invitrogen)-competent E. coli by electroporation using a Bio-Rad GenePulser Xcell according to the manufacturer's instructions. Yeast transformation of plasmid DNA, gap-repaired DNA, and the gene disruption fragment was performed using standard protocols. Other Procedures—Cell lysates for immunoblotting were prepared by glass bead beating cells in 10% trichloroacetic acid, 100 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies and detected using chemiluminescence (Western Lightening; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Rabbit peroxidase anti-peroxidase (Sigma) or rabbit anti-TAP (made against the carboxyl terminus of the TAP construct after TEV cleavage (Open Biosystems)) was used for TAP detection at a 1:1000 dilution; rabbit polyclonal anti-His6 (1:3000; Abcam), mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc (1:1000; Covance), or rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Myc (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used to detect tagged proteins on Western blots. Cell lysates for immunoprecipitation analysis were prepared by glass bead beating the cells in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5.0% nonfat milk and probed with the indicated antibodies as before. Cell lysates for Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) purification of His-tagged proteins were prepared as described above except that the lysis buffer contained 10 mm imidazole, and the His-tagged proteins were eluted from the beads using lysis buffer containing 500 mm imidazole (5 min at room temperature). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (10Crisp R.C. Adkins E.M. Kimmel E. Kaplan J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The quantitative β-galactosidase activity assay and the reporter constructs used were described previously (6Chen O.S. Crisp R.J. Valachovic M. Bard M. Winge D.R. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29513-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The aconitase activity assay was performed as described (11Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16922-16927Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Intracellular localization of Aft1 was determined by fluorescence microscopy of the green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged protein, as described previously (12Crisp R.J. Pollington A. Galea C. Jaron S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45499-45506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The percentage of cells showing nuclear Aft1-GFP was quantified. Two independent experiments were performed, and in each experiment, 10 fields/condition were examined, and the percentage of cells showing nuclear fluorescence was determined. Greater than 300 cells/condition were counted. Subcellular localization of Grx3 was determined by immunoblot using postmitochondrial supernatant, crude mitochondria, and purified mitochondrial extracts prepared as previously described (13Meisinger C. Sommer T. Pfanner N. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Polyclonal Antisera—New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with Fra1 protein expressed in E. coli. The FRA1 open reading frame with a carboxyl-terminal His6 tag was cloned into the pET21a vector (Novagen) and expressed in Rosetta DE3 cells (Novagen). Protein production was induced using isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the protein was purified using an Ni2+-NTA column (Qiagen). Fra1-specific antibodies were purified from serum using a Fra1-agarose column generated by immobilizing recombinant Fra1 using the AminoLink Plus Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions using the pH 7.2 coupling buffer. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Fra2 was generated commercially by Washington Biotechnology using the sequence RETKRQRHYKMPVTEQ conjugated to KLH; anti-Fra2 was used at a 1:1000 dilution for Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. For Grx3 antibody production, the Grx3 open reading frame lacking the first 35 amino acids (Δ1–35) was cloned into pET21a and expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). The protein was precipitated with ammonium sulfate, resuspended, desalted, and then loaded onto a DEAE column followed by a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). The purified protein was used to prepare rabbit-generated anti-Grx3 antibodies (Cocalico Biologicals, Reamstown, PA). We utilized a genetic approach to identify mutant genes that activate the iron regulon in iron-replete cells. Three classes of mutants might be expected to show increased expression of the iron regulon. The first class consists of mutations in genes that encode the high affinity iron transport system (FET3, FTR1) or in genes required for the assembly of the high affinity transport systems. Mutations in these genes lead to reduced cellular iron and increased expression of the iron transport system. The second class includes mutations in genes that encode elements of the mitochondrial Fe-S cluster synthesis and export system. The third class of mutants is expected to interrupt the regulatory signal between mitochondrial Fe-S clusters and Aft1. Activation of the iron regulon by the first class of mutations can be suppressed by incubation of cells in high iron medium, since transport of iron by the low affinity iron transport systems would satisfy cellular iron needs and down-regulate high affinity iron transport. The other two classes of mutations would not be suppressed by high external iron. A yeast strain was generated that contained a FET3-lacZ reporter construct integrated at the HO locus. Abundant β-galactosidase activity would be produced when cells are incubated in medium made iron limited through the addition of the cell-impermeable iron chelator BPS (Fig. 1). Little FET3-lacZ activity is seen when wild type cells are incubated in SD. If a deletion in FET3 is introduced into this strain, β-galactosidase activity is activated due to defective iron acquisition. The addition of 50 μm iron to SD, however, suppresses the production of β-galactosidase activity, since cells become iron-replete by the transport of iron through low affinity iron transporters. Based on this result, we mutagenized cells containing an integrated copy of FET3-lacZ by UV light and selected for colonies that showed increased β-galactosidase activity (blue-white assay) when plated on medium containing 50 μm iron. We screened 40,000 colonies to identify those that showed increased β-galactosidase activity in the presence of iron-replete medium. Each mutant was crossed to a wild type strain (also carrying an integrated FET3-lacZ), and all were found to be recessive and, when sporulated, behaved as a single gene defect, showing 2:2 segregation. Each mutant was transformed with a low copy library, and transformants that regained the ability to regulate the FET3-lacZ reporter in an iron-dependent manner were further analyzed. We identified six genes that affected expression of FET3-lacZ. Two of the genes encoded proteins shown to have a direct role in Fe-S cluster synthesis, NFS1 (14Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 15Li J. Kogan M. Knight S.A. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33025-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and ISU1 (16Schilke B. Voisine C. Beinert H. Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10206-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). A third gene, GSH2, encodes an enzyme involved in glutathione synthesis. It is known that deletion of GSH1 decreases Fe-S cluster synthesis (17Sipos K. Lange H. Fekete Z. Ullmann P. Lill R. Kispal G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26944-26949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and it might be expected that deletion of GSH2 would also affect Fe-S cluster synthesis. The fourth gene, MTM1, is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family. In the absence of MTM1, there is a defect in the activity of Sod2 due to increased mitochondrial iron (18Luk E. Carroll M. Baker M. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10353-10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Deletion of MTM1 was also shown to activate the iron regulon, although the mechanism is not known. These results confirm the hypothesis that iron-sulfur cluster synthesis participates in the regulation of Aft1 activity. The fifth gene identified encodes Sin4, which is part of the multiprotein Mediator complex (19Li Y. Bjorklund S. Jiang Y.W. Kim Y.J. Lane W.S. Stillman D.J. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10864-10868Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This complex interacts with RNA polymerase II to positively or negatively regulate transcription. Mutations in members of the Mediator complex have been shown to alter the basal rate of transcription of Aft1 target genes (20van de Peppel J. Kettelarij N. van Bakel H. Kockelkorn T.T. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Identification of a Novel Gene FRA1 (YLL029W) Involved in the Regulation of the Iron Regulon—The sixth gene identified by the screen was an unknown open reading frame, YLL029W. This gene complemented three independent mutants that were in the same complementation group. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that YLL029W affects activation of the iron regulon. First, we rescued YLL029W from mutant IF17B, sequenced the rescued allele, and identified a missense mutation, which results in an amino acid change from leucine 590 to proline. Second, in haploids obtained from the mating of wild type and mutant strain IF17B, the mutant allele co-segregated with increased expression of FET3-lacZ. Third, deletion of YLL029W in the S288C diploid deletion collection (Research Genetics) also showed increased expression of FET3-lacZ in high iron-containing medium. Fourth, a targeted deletion of YLL029W in W303, the background strain used in this screen, showed increased expression of FET3-lacZ, and a diploid between the deletion strain and mutant IF17B showed increased FET3-lacZ expression. Based on these data, we refer to YLL029W as FRA1 (Fe repressor of activation-1), and we refer to yll029wL590P as fra1-1. To determine if transcriptional activation of the FET3-lacZ reporter construct is dependent on Aft1, we generated a Δaft1 fra1-1 strain containing an integrated FET3-lacZ reporter construct. Deletion of AFT1 negated the FET3-lacZ expression in fra1-1 cells, since no expression of β-galactosidase was detected by blue-white assay. This result shows that FRA1 participates in the regulation of Aft1-mediated expression of the iron regulon. Wild type cells show no FET3 mRNA when cultured in high iron medium (Fig. 2A). Under similar conditions, the fra1-1 strain showed robust expression of FET3 mRNA, which was reduced upon transformation with a FRA1-containing plasmid. Expression of FET3 mRNA in fra1-1 cells was dependent on the transcription factor Aft1, since deletion of AFT1 in fra1-1 cells resulted in the loss of FET3 mRNA. We assayed β-galactosidase activity expressed from a FET3 reporter construct to quantify transcriptional activity. This reporter construct contains the FET3 promoter but lacks the endogenous 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, precluding post-transcriptional regulation of the reporter construct. Wild type cells show minimal expression of β-galactosidase in cells incubated in either YPD or YPD supplemented with iron (Fig. 2B). In contrast, fra1-1 cells grown in either YPD or iron-supplemented YPD showed increased expression of β-galactosidase. Incubation of fra1-1 mutant cells in low iron medium, however, resulted in a further increase in reporter activity, suggesting that iron depletion affects the regulation of the iron regulon even in the absence of FRA1. Transformation of fra1-1 or Δfra1 cells with plasmids containing reporter constructs for the Mac1-regulated copper regulon (CTR1-lacZ) or the Zap1 regulated zinc regulon (ZRT1-lacZ) showed no increased expression over wild type cells (data not shown). This result shows that deletion of FRA1 is specific for transcriptional activation of FET3. Deletion of FRA2 Affects Activation of the Iron Regulon—A large scale interaction study reported that Fra1 physically interacts with Grx3, Grx4, and a protein encoded by an unknown open reading frame, YGL220W (21Ho Y.

We examined the effect of deletion of YGL220W on expression of the FET3-lacZ reporter construct, since two recent studies showed that deletion of GRX3 and GRX4 leads to induction of the iron regulon (9Ojeda L.

W303 cells with a deletion in YGL220W are viable and show increased expression of FET3 mRNA as analyzed by S1 analysis (data not shown). To examine the relationship between FRA1 and FRA2, we generated a double mutant strain, fra1-1Δfra2, and measured the activity of the integrated FET3-lacZ reporter gene under various iron conditions. Deletion of FRA2 led to an increase in β-galactosidase expression that was similar to that seen in fra1-1 cells. Deletion of FRA2 in a fra1-1 strain did not lead to any further increase in FET3-lacZ expression (Fig. 2B), suggesting that Fra1"

https://openalex.org/W1977032456,"The release of amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) may be triggered by extracellular cues through gamma-secretase-dependent cleavage. AICD binds to Fe65, which may have a role in AICD-dependent signalling; however, the functional ligand has not been characterized. In this study, we have identified TAG1 as a functional ligand of APP. We found that, through an extracellular interaction with APP, TAG1 increased AICD release and triggered Fe65-dependent activity in a gamma-secretase-dependent manner. TAG1, APP and Fe65 colocalized in the neural stem cell niche of the fetal ventricular zone. Neural precursor cells from TAG1-/-, APP-/- and TAG1-/-;APP-/- mice had aberrantly enhanced neurogenesis, which was significantly reversed in TAG1-/- mice by TAG1 or AICD but not by AICD mutated at the Fe65 binding site. Notably, TAG1 reduced normal neurogenesis in Fe65+/+ mice. Abnormally enhanced neurogenesis also occurred in Fe65-/- mice but could not be reversed by TAG1. These results describe a TAG1-APP signalling pathway that negatively modulates neurogenesis through Fe65."

The p53-dependent transcriptional program is remarkably flexible, as it varies with the nature of p53-activating stimuli, the cell type and the duration of the activation signal. This flexibility may allow cells to mount alternative responses to p53 activation, such as cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Here, I organize the available data into two alternative models to explain how this regulatory diversity is achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2088575891,"We have previously shown that ASK1-interacting protein 1 (AIP1) transduces tumor necrosis factor-induced ASK1-JNK signaling. Because endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activates ASK1-JNK signaling cascade, we investigated the role of AIP1 in ER stress-induced signaling. We created AIP1-deficient mice (AIP1-KO) from which mouse embryonic fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells were isolated. AIP1-KO cells show dramatic reductions in ER stress-induced, but not oxidative stress-induced, ASK1-JNK activation and cell apoptosis. The ER stress-induced IRE1-JNK/XBP-1 axis, but not the PERK-CHOP1 axis, is blunted in AIP1-KO cells. ER stress induced formation of an AIP1-IRE1 complex, and the PH domain of AIP1 is critical for the IRE1 interaction. Furthermore, reconstitution of AIP1-KO cells with AIP1 wild type, not an AIP1 mutant with a deletion of the PH domain (AIP1-DeltaPH), restores ER stress-induced IRE1-JNK/XBP-1 signaling. AIP1-IRE1 association facilitates IRE1 dimerization, a critical step for activation of IRE1 signaling. More importantly, AIP1-KO mice show impaired ER stress-induced IRE1-dependent signaling in vivo. We conclude that AIP1 is essential for transducing the IRE1-mediated ER stress response."
https://openalex.org/W1976467219,"Melanosomes are lysosome-related organelles specialized in melanin synthesis and transport. In this study, we show that microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) silencing induces melanosome gathering around the nucleus and causes the relocalization of Rab27A, Slac2a-Mlph, and Myo5a that control the transport of melanosomes on the actin network. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism by which MITF controls melanosome distribution, we identify RAB27A as a new MITF target gene. Indeed, MITF silencing leads to a dramatic decrease in Rab27A expression and blocks the stimulation of Rab27A expression evoked by cAMP. Further, forced expression of MITF increases Rab27A expression, indicating that MITF is required and sufficient for Rab27A expression in melanoma cells. MITF binds to two E-boxes in the proximal region of the Rab27A promoter and stimulates its transcriptional activity. Finally, re-expression of Rab27A, in MITF-depleted cells, restores the transport of melanosomes to the cell periphery. These results show that RAB27A is a new direct transcriptional target of MITF and link MITF to melanosome transport, another key parameter of melanocyte differentiation and skin pigmentation. Interestingly, Rab27A is involved in other fundamental physiological functions, such as the transport of lytic granules and insulin secretion. Thus our results, deciphering the mechanism of Rab27A transcriptional regulation, have an interest that goes beyond the skin pigmentation field.

In humans, pigmentation results from the synthesis and distribution of melanin in skin, hair bulbs, and eyes (1Goding C.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 257-259Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Melanin synthesis or melanogenesis is an enzymatic process, catalyzed by tyrosinase, Tyrp1 (tyrosinase-related protein 1), and dopachrome tautomerase (DCT), 5The abbreviations used are: DCT, dopachrome tautomerase; MITF, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; WB, Western blot; IF, immunofluorescence; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; siMITF, Mitf siRNA; siScr, scrambled siRNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. 5The abbreviations used are: DCT, dopachrome tautomerase; MITF, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; WB, Western blot; IF, immunofluorescence; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; siMITF, Mitf siRNA; siScr, scrambled siRNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. which converts tyrosine to melanin pigments. This process takes place in melanocytes within lysosome-related vesicles named melanosomes that are transported to the dendrites tips and transferred to surrounding keratinocytes to ensure hair and skin pigmentation. In humans, melanins play a key photo-protective role against the noxious effect of UV radiation from solar light. Numerous studies have been undertaken to understand the molecular mechanisms that control melanosome distribution within melanocytes. It has been demonstrated that melanosomes are subjected to both a bidirectional microtubule-dependent transport and an unidirectional actin-dependent transport that allow melanosome docking at the dendrite tips (2Barral D.C. Seabra M.C. Pigment Cell Res. 2004; 17: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The microtubule-dependent transport of melanosomes is controlled by kinesin for transport toward the cell periphery, whereas the minus-end motility toward the cell center is mediated by dynein that is linked to melanosome by the Rab7-RILP (Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein) complex (3Jordens I.

At the cell periphery, the Rab27A-melanophilin (Slac2a-Mlph) complex recruits the actin-dependent motor protein, myosin 5a (Myo5a), allowing melanosomes to move on the actin network (4Bahadoran P.

The following step is the anchoring of melanosomes to the plasma membrane through simultaneous interaction of Slp2, with Rab27A on the melanosomes and phosphatidylserine at the plasma membrane (7Kuroda T.S.

In humans, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone is a key physiological regulator of melanocyte differentiation and skin pigmentation (8Busca R. Ballotti R. Pigment Cell Res. 2000; 13: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). α-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone binds to the melanocortin receptor type 1 and activates the cAMP pathway, thereby leading to a stimulation of melanogenesis (9Garcia-Borron J.C. Sanchez-Laorden B.L. Jimenez-Cervantes C. Pigment Cell Res. 2005; 18: 393-410PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we have demonstrated that cAMP rapidly increases the interaction of the Slac2a-Mlph with actin and leads to the rapid accumulation of melanosomes in the actin-rich region of the dendrite extremities. Further, cAMP stimulates the expression of Rab27A that could facilitate the interaction of melanosomes with cortical actin (10Passeron T. Bahadoran P. Bertolotto C. Chiaverini C. Busca R. Valony G.

In melanocytes the effects of cAMP on melanin synthesis are mediated by microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), which is the master gene of melanocyte development, differentiation, and survival. Until now MITF has been demonstrated to control the expression of tyrosinase, Tyrp1, and DCT, the enzymes that are essential for melanin production (11Gaggioli C. Busca R. Abbe P. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Pigment Cell Res. 2003; 16: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Bertolotto C. Busca R. Abbe P. Bille K. Aberdam E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). MITF also controls genes involved in melanosome genesis or structure such as MART1, Silver, and GPR143 (OA1) (13Levy C. Khaled M. Fisher D.E. Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 406-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The gene encoding the melanosomal protein, TRPM1, with unknown function is also a MITF target gene (13Levy C. Khaled M. Fisher D.E. Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 406-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). However, until now MITF has never been involved in the regulation of melanosome transport. In this study we have dissected the regulation of melanosome transport by MITF in human and mouse melanoma cells. We demonstrate that MITF regulates the peripheral distribution of melanosomes to the dendrite tips via the control of Rab27A expression. MITF directly binds to the Rab27A promoter, thereby increasing its activity. Re-expression of Rab27A in MITF-depleted B16 cells restores the peripheral melanosome transport. Taken together, we demonstrate the involvement of MITF in the actin-dependent melanosome transport that is, together with melanin synthesis, a key functional trait of differentiated melanocytes underlying skin pigmentation. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Infection—Mouse melanoma B16-F10 cells, human melanoma Mel501 cells, and A375 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU; 50 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. B16 and Mel501 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. In brief, 3 × 106 cells in 100-cm2 culture dishes were transfected with 70 μl of Lipofectamine and 15 μg of plasmid or 100 nm of siRNAs in Optimen. After 6 h, the cells were replaced in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum. A375 cells were infected with control and MITF encoding adenovirus for 72 h as described elsewhere (11Gaggioli C. Busca R. Abbe P. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Pigment Cell Res. 2003; 16: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Plasmid, siRNA, and Adenovirus—Rab27A-GFP and GFP-N1 plasmids were described previously (4Bahadoran P. Aberdam E. Mantoux F. Busca R. Bille K. Yalman N. de Saint-Basile G. Casaroli-Marano R. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). siRNA-mediated down-regulation of MITF was achieved with a specific MITF siRNA (36Larribere L. Hilmi C. Khaled M. Gaggioli C. Bille K. Auberger P. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Bertolotto C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1980-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and scrambled siRNA was used as control. Recombinant adenovirus encoding wild type MITF (Ad-MITF) was previously described (11Gaggioli C. Busca R. Abbe P. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Pigment Cell Res. 2003; 16: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Antibodies—A polyclonal anti-melanophilin antibody was obtained by immunization of rabbits with two peptides within the C-terminal domain of mouse melanophilin and was used at 1/500 dilution for Western blot (WB) and 1/50 dilution for immunofluorescence (IF) (10Passeron T. Bahadoran P. Bertolotto C. Chiaverini C. Busca R. Valony G. Bille K. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody to Tyrp1 (PEP1) (from Dr. Hearing, NCI, National Institutes of Health) were used at 1/2,000 dilution for WB and 1/200 for IF. Monoclonal antibodies to Tyrp1 (B8G3) (from Dr Parson) and to Silver protein (HMB45) (Dakopatts) were used respectively at 1/15 and 1/100 dilution for IF. Monoclonal antibody to MITF (C5) (Abcam) was used at 1/100 dilution for WB and 1/10 for IF. Polyclonal antibody to the C terminus part of MITF, used at 1/250, was previously described (37Bertolotto C. Abbe P. Hemesath T.J. Bille K. Fisher D.E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody to Rab27A (Transduction Laboratories), and the polyclonal antibody to Myo5a (provided by Dr. Mooseker, Yale University, New Haven, CT) were used at 1/2000 for WB and 1/100 for IF. The monoclonal ERK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1/2000 for WB. The anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies as well as the fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were from Dakopatts. Immunofluorescence Study—B16 or Mel501 cells cultured on glass coverslips were washed three times in PBS, fixed for 20 min in 3% paraformaldehyde, washed again, and incubated for 10 min in 50 mm NH4Cl after three more PBS washes. The cells were next incubated with the primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% saponin for 1 h, washed abundantly in PBS, and incubated for another hour with the appropriate conjugated secondary antibody. After washing, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides and viewed with an Axiophot fluorescent microscope (Zeiss). Western Blot—Proteins 40 μg were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were saturated in a saline buffer, 2% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with the corresponding primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After three 10-min washes in a saline buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100, the blots were incubated for 1 h with the corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and washed again. The antigen-antibody complex was detected with the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Construction of the Reporter Plasmids—A 800-bp fragment 5′ of the transcriptional start site of the Rab27A transcript was isolated and amplified by PCR and then inserted into plasmid vector pCR2.1-TOPO (TOPO TA Cloning®, Invitrogen). The 800-bp fragment was subcloned into the unique XhoI and SacI restriction site of the pGL3basic vector (pGL3B), upstream of the luciferase coding sequence (pR27a). The first nucleotide of the first exon was numbered 1. For the deletion constructs, pR27a was cut with EcoRV (0.6 kb) or BsgI (0.2 kb) and then self-ligated with T4 DNA ligase, giving, respectively, the following plasmids: pR27a-Δ1 and pR27a-Δ2. pR27A-mE1, pR27A-mE2, and pR27A-mE3 mutants were constructed with the Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, the CANNTG sequence of each E-box was replaced by a TCNNTG sequence using the following oligonucleotide: E-box 1 (5′-GAAAGGGGCAAAAATTCCTTGACTGGTCTGCAGTGCC-3′), E-box 2 (5′-ACTGGTCTGCAGTGCTCTATGACAAACAGCTGAGAC-3′). The plasmid containing the MITF coding sequence in pCDNA3 was previously described (38Bertolotto C. Bille K. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assays—B16 melanoma cells were seeded in 24-well dishes, and transient transfections were performed the following day using 2 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and 0.5 μg of total plasmid DNA in a 200-μl final volume. pCMV-βGal was cotransfected with the tested plasmids to control transfection efficiency. 24 h after transfection, soluble extracts were harvested in 50 μl of lysis buffer and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. All of the transfections were repeated at least five times using different plasmid preparations. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Double-stranded synthetic E1 box (5′-TATGACAAACAGCTGAGAC-3′), E2-box (5′-CTGCAGTGCCATATGACAAACAGC-3′) and corresponding mutated boxes, mE1 and mE2 (5′-TATGACAAATCGCTGAGAC-3′ and 5′-CTGCAGTGCTCTATGACAAACAGC-3′) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts from B16 cells, prepared as previously described (12Bertolotto C. Busca R. Abbe P. Bille K. Aberdam E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), were preincubated in binding buffer for 15 min on ice. Then 30,000-50,000 cpm of 32P-labeled probe were added to the binding reaction for 10 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1;acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in TBE buffer (22.5 mm Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8) for 2 h at 150 V. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—B16 cells were cultured in 100-cm2 culture dishes, stimulated (or not) with forskolin for 5 h, and then treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. Next, the cells were harvested in PBS, centrifuged (700 × g, 5 min at 4 °C), and suspended in the lysis buffer (EZ ChIP™ chromatin immunoprecipitation kit; Upstate). After sonication the sheared chromatin was then immunoprecipitated using indicated antibodies. After immunoprecipitation, the cross-link was reverted by heat treatment (65 °C overnight and proteinase K digestion). The genomic captured fragments were purified using spin columns. Identification of the captured DNA fragments was performed by PCR analysis using the Rab27A or GAPDH promoter primers. 30 cycles of PCR were performed, and the amplified products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. Mitf Silencing Affects Melanosome Distribution in B16 Melanoma Cells—In B16F10 melanoma cells, immunofluorescence labeling with antibody to Tyrp1 (Fig. 1, green) showed that melanosomes were distributed all over the cells. After forskolin treatment for 24 h, we observed that cells acquired a dendritic phenotype and that melanosomes were gathered at the dendrite tips. We also observed an increased Mitf expression after forskolin treatment (Fig. 1A). These observations prompted us to hypothesize that Mitf might play a role in the control of melanosome distribution. Indeed, transfection with specific Mitf siRNA dramatically inhibited Mitf expression, in both basal and forskolin conditions, in more than 98% of the cells. Interestingly, Mitf silencing altered melanosome distribution and prevented melanosome docking at dendrite tips in forskolin-treated cells (Fig. 1B). These observations indicate that Mitf is involved in the cAMP regulation of melanosome peripheral distribution. Mitf Silencing Induces Relocalization of the Myosin 5a, Slac2a-Mlph, Rab27A, and Inhibits Rab27A Expression—Peripheral melanosome transport involves a tripartite complex composed of Myo5a, Slac2a-Mlph, and Rab27A that allows melanosomes to interact and move on actin filament. Hence, we studied the effect of Mitf silencing on these proteins. B16 melanoma cells were transfected with scrambled or Mitf siRNA (siMITF) and then exposed for 24 h to forskolin. Mitf and Myo5a, Slac2a-Mlph, or Rab27A expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence. In cells transfected with scrambled siRNA (siScr), Myo5a, Slac2a-Mlph and Rab27A all showed a reinforced localization at the cell periphery, whereas after Mitf silencing as shown by the absence of red labeling, these proteins were relocalized within the cell body (Fig. 2A). Therefore Mitf silencing impairs Myo5a-Mlph-Rab27A tripartite complex distribution. Next, we hypothesize that Mitf might control the expression of one or several members of the tripartite complex that allow melanosome peripheral distribution. To verify this hypothesis, B16 melanoma cells were transfected with scrambled or Mitf siRNA and treated or not with forskolin. Myo5a, Slac2a-Mlph, Rab27A protein expression was analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 2B). In control conditions, forskolin increased Mitf, tyrosinase, Myo5a, and Rab27A expression. Slac2a-Mlph expression was not affected by forskolin. Transfection with siMITF dramatically reduced Mitf expression. In these cells, we observed an almost complete extinction of tyrosinase and Rab27A expression. Slac2a-Mlph or ERK2 expression was not affected compared with cells transfected with scrambled siRNA. A slight, but reproducible decrease (15-25%) in Myo5a expression was also observed. Mitf Stimulates Rab27A Transcription and Binds Directly to the Rab27A Promoter—Next, we analyzed the effect of Mitf silencing on Rab27A messengers. Real time PCR analysis showed that forskolin treatment increased the mRNA levels of Mitf, tyrosinase, and Rab27A. On the other hand, in cells transfected with siMITF, we observed a dramatic decrease in Mitf, tyrosinase, and Rab27A messengers (Fig. 3A), suggesting that Mitf controlled Rab27A expression at the transcriptional level. To perform a functional analysis of the Rab27A promoter, we cloned a 800-bp fragment of the Rab27A gene from +33 to -870 according to Tolmachova et al. (14Tolmachova T. Ramalho J.S. Anant J.S. Schultz R.A. Huxley C.M. Seabra M.C. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) upstream from the luciferase reporter gene. This fragment contains seven E-boxes susceptible to bind Mitf (Fig. 3B). Further, human and mouse Rab27A promoters show a strong homology in the proximal region. This region contains three E-boxes that are conserved in both mouse and human promoters (Fig. 3C). Functional analysis of this promoter fragment (Fig. 3D) showed that the Rab27A promoter was responsive to cAMP, because forskolin treatment led to a 5-fold increase in the luciferase activity. Cotransfection of the Rab27A promoter reporter construct with an expression plasmid encoding Mitf also strongly increased the promoter activity. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Mitf regulates Rab27A expression at the transcriptional level. Then we studied two deletion constructs that removed one (pR27a-D1) and four E-boxes, respectively (pR27a-D2), at the 5′ end of the promoter. Both constructs showed almost the same responsiveness to cAMP and Mitf compared with the wild type construct. These data indicate that the cAMP- and Mitf-responsive elements are located within proximal region containing three E-boxes. Individual mutation of these E-boxes showed that mutation of the most 5′ E-box (E-box3) did not affect the stimulation of the Rab27A promoter activity by cAMP or Mitf, whereas mutation of either E-box 1 or E-box 2 led to a strong decrease in the stimulation elicited by cAMP or by Mitf. Thus E-boxes 1 and 2 likely bind Mitf and mediate the effect of cAMP. To verify that Mitf indeed binds to the Rab27A promoter, we performed a gel shift assay with labeled E-boxes 1 and 2. Nuclear extracts from B16 melanoma cells exposed to forskolin showed an increased binding to the labeled E-box 1 and 2 (Fig. 4). In each case, the binding was displaced by an excess of the unlabeled probe but not or slightly affected by an excess of unlabeled mutated corresponding E-box. Mitf was identified as the protein that binds to the E-box 1 and 2, because an anti-Mitf antibody dramatically reduced the formation of the complexes with E-box 1 and 2 and induced a weak supershift of the complexes. To verify the binding of Mitf to the Rab27A promoter in intact cells, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay in B16 melanoma cells. Direct PCR amplification, with specific primers spanning the Rab27A promoter, on cross-linked protein-DNA total extract amplified a band of 800 bp (Fig. 4B, left panel, Input). Alternatively, the extracts were first immunoprecipitated with antibody to polymerase II as positive control, nonimmune rabbit IgG as a negative control or anti-Mitf antibody. After immunoprecipitation with anti-Mitf, we amplified a band at 800 bp corresponding to the Rab27A promoter. This band was clearly increased in extracts from cells exposed to forskolin. We also amplified the Rab27A promoter in anti-Pol II precipitates, but not in nonimmune antibody precipitates. Instead, using PCR amplification with specific GAPDH promoter primers, we amplified a 1-kb fragment corresponding to the GAPDH promoter both in the total input and in the anti-Pol II precipitates, but not in the anti-Mitf precipitates (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate that Mitf binds to the Rab27A promoter in intact cells. Rab27A Re-expression Restores Normal Melanosome Distribution in Mitf-deficient Melanoma Cells—We wished to assess whether the loss of Rab27A expression in Mitf-deficient cells was indeed responsible for the aberrant distribution of melanosomes. In this aim, we expressed Rab27A-GFP in B16 melanoma cells transfected with siMITF (Fig. 5). As previously observed, Mitf silencing induced melanosome (visualized with an anti-Tyrp1 antibody, red) gathering at the cell center, compared with cell transfected with scrambled siRNA. However, in the cells that expressed Rab27A-GFP (Fig. 5, green), melanosomes spread all over the cells and reached the dendrite tips. This observation was made in more than 90% of the cell lacking Mitf and that re-expressed Rab27A. In contrast, in cells that expressed GFP alone, melanosome distribution was not modified compared with nontransfected cells. Therefore forced Rab27A expression is able to restore melanosome peripheral distribution in Mitf-depleted cells. MITF Controls RAB27A Expression and Melanosome Distribution in Human Melanoma Cells—Finally, we wished to confirm that MITF also controlled melanosome distribution in human cells. We performed the same experiment in human melanoma cells Mel501, and we observed, as is the case in B16 melanoma cells, that MITF silencing led to striking melanosome gathering at the cell center compared with cells expressing MITF (Fig. 6A). Western blot analysis confirmed that siMITF dramatically inhibited both MITF and RAB27A expression but did not affect MYO5A level (Fig. 6B). Thus MITF appears to be required for RAB27A expression. To investigate whether MITF was sufficient to trigger RAB27A expression, we infected A375 human melanoma cells, which express a very low level of MITF, with an empty adenovirus or an adenovirus encoding wild type MITF. We observed that infection with MITF-encoding adenovirus led to a strong increase in both MITF and RAB27A expression (Fig. 6C), whereas the empty adenovirus did not affect the level of RAB27A protein. Forced MITF expression did not affect MYO5A expression. Identical results have been obtained in SKmel28 human melanoma cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that MITF is required and sufficient for RAB27A expression in human melanoma cells. In the present report, we identify RAB27A as a new MITF target gene and show the involvement of MITF in melanosome distribution within melanoma cells. Indeed, MITF silencing induces melanosome gathering around the nucleus and leads to a dramatic decrease in Rab27A expression. In both mouse and human melanoma cells, cAMP elevating agents increase Rab27A expression. This effect is blocked by MITF silencing, indicating that MITF mediates the effects of cAMP on Rab27A expression. Further, adenovirus-forced expression of MITF increases Rab27A protein level, demonstrating that MITF is sufficient to trigger Rab27A expression. Conversely, tyrosinase, which is also a MITF target gene, is not induced by ectopic expression of MITF (11Gaggioli C. Busca R. Abbe P. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Pigment Cell Res. 2003; 16: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Tyrosinase gene appears to have a nonpermissive chromatin conformation, and MITF needs to recruit the SWI/SNF complex that allow chromatin remodeling and tyrosinase expression (15de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y. Higashi C. Dutta C. Osias J. Kommajosyula N. Tachibana T. Imbalzano A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20233-20241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). RAB27A, as well HIF1A (16Busca R. Berra E. Gaggioli C. Khaled M. Bille K. Marchetti B. Thyss R. Fitsialos G. Larribere L. Bertolotto C. Virolle T. Barbry P. Pouyssegur J. Ponzio G. Ballotti R. J.

In our study, melanosomes are visualized by Tyrp1 or Silver labeling. Indeed, in cells transfected with siMITF, it is not possible to observe black melanosomes containing melanin, because MITF silencing causes a complete and rapid loss of tyrosinase and melanin content in pigmented melanoma cells. Thus we cannot rule out the possibility that MITF silencing affects Tyrp1 and Silver targeting to melanosomes. However, MITF silencing obviously affects the distribution of both Tyrp1 and Silver containing vesicles. Rab27A has been reported to stabilize MLPH (20Hume A.N. Ushakov D.S. Tarafder A.K. Ferenczi M.A. Seabra M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3111-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus the loss of rab27 in MITF-silenced cells was expected to decrease MLPH expression. However, in our experiments the level of MLPH is not affected by MITF silencing. This observation might be explained by a residual amount of Rab27A that is sufficient to stabilize MLPH but not to ensure a correct melanosome transport. Several other RAB proteins, including RAB3A (21Scott G. Zhao Q. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 296-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), RAB7 (3Jordens I.

Ichihashi M. Cell Tissue Res. 2003; 314: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have been involved in melanosome transport. However, in our hands, none of them are regulated by MITF (data not shown). It is noteworthy that we observe that MITF silencing also induces morphologic changes in melanoma cells with a loss of the dendritic processes. Kuroda and Fukuda (7Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) reported that Slac2a-Mlph, a Rab27A effector, is required for elongated melanocyte shape, but this effect is independent of the ability of Slac2a-Mlph to bind Rab27A. Further, no morphology changes have been reported either in melanocyte from ashen mice (24Wilson S.M. Yip R. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Zhang Y. Novak E.K. Swank R.T. Russell L.B. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7933-7938Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) or in melanoma cells transfected with dominant negative form of Rab27A (25Bahadoran P. Busca R. Chiaverini C. Westbroek W. Lambert J. Bille K. Valony G. Fukuda M. Naeyaert J.M. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Biol.

Dermatol. 2002; 118: 933-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus the loss of Rab27A expression does not seem to be responsible for the cell shape modification. The effect of MITF silencing on melanoma cell shape might be explained by the inhibition of other MITF targets. A good candidate could be Diaph1, a new MITF target gene (27Carreira S. Goodall J. Denat L. Rodriguez M. Nuciforo P. Hoek K.S. Testori A. Larue L. Goding C.R. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3426-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) that controls the actin cytoskeleton and cell morphology. Because the actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in melanosome transport, one could argue that changes in melanosome repartition might be the consequence of the alteration of the actin network. However, the inhibition of ROCK by Y27632, in cells depleted in MITF by specific siRNA restores dendricity but not peripheral melanosome localization (data not shown). Moreover, in MITF-depleted cells, re-expression of Rab27A restores melanosome transport to the cell periphery, demonstrating that the loss of Rab27A expression was the primary cause of melanosome mislocalization. Within human and mouse RAB27A gene, we identify a promoter region at 5′ of the human transcript (NM 004580) that shows a strong homology with the 5′ region of the mouse transcript (AF 304376) described by Wilson et al. (24Wilson S.M. Yip R. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Zhang Y. Novak E.K. Swank R.T. Russell L.B. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7933-7938Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Interestingly, within these regions, three proximal E-boxes are perfectly conserved. The functional analysis of the Rab27A promoter shows that this fragment is responsive to cAMP and MITF. Two more proximal E-boxes bind MITF and mediate the cAMP effect. Interestingly, the antibody to Mitf does not completely competed out the complexes formed with E1 and E2 probes, suggesting that other basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors such as TFE3 or USF1 can bind to these sequences, at least in vitro. The sequences of these E-boxes (CATATG and CAGCTG) do not match perfectly with the consensus sequence (CATGTG) targeted by MITF in the other differentiation gene such as TYR, TYRP1, and DCT (28Aksan I. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 6930-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, recently several new MITF target genes (CDKN1A, CDKN2A, CDK2, HIF1A, and BCL2) (16Busca R.

In addition to melanosome transport, Rab27A has been involved in other biological functions such as secretion of cytotoxic granules by cytotoxic T lymphocyte (31Stinchcombe J.C. Barral D.C. Mules E.H. Booth S. Hume A.N. Machesky L.M. Seabra M.C. Griffiths G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and insulin secretion by pancreas β cells (32Yi Z.

Interestingly, TFE3 and TFEB, which share a strong homology with MITF, are expressed in T lymphocyte (33Huan C. Kelly M.L. Steele R. Shapira I. Gottesman S.R. Roman C.A. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1082-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In these cells, TFE3 and TFEB might regulate Rab27A expression and thus the cytotoxic response. Similarly, NeuroD1/BETA2 is a key transcription factor required for pancreas endocrine cell differentiation. NeuroD1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor and binds to the E-box motif (34Chu K. Nemoz-Gaillard E. Tsai M.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 23-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus NeuroD1 might regulate insulin secretion through the control of Rab27A expression in pancreas β cells. In other cell types expressing Rab27A, the transcriptional regulation of this gene might involve a ubiquitous helix-loop-helix transcription factor such as Usf1 or Myc that could bind to the E-boxes of the Rab27A promoter. Patients with Griscelli syndrome type 2 have hypopigmentation (skin and hairs) and a hemophagocytic syndrome caused by Rab27A mutation (35Menasche G. Fischer A. de Saint Basile G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 1237-1238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, some patients with these symptoms have no mutation in the Rab27A coding sequence. These cases might be explained by a reduced Rab27A expression, ensuing mutations in the E-boxes that bind MITF (or other basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors). Until now, we have sequenced the promoter region of five patients with Griscelli syndrome type 2 without mutation in Rab27A coding sequence. We found no mutation in the RAB27A promoter region of these patients. In skin, UV radiations induce an increase of MITF expression in melanocytes via α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone synthesis, MC1R activation, and increase in cAMP levels. Cyclic AMP appears to control melanosome transport by two different mechanisms. The first one involves a rapid accumulation of melanosome to dendrite tips, probably through post-translational modifications that either favor Mlph interaction with actin (10Passeron T. Bahadoran P.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As shown in this report, the second one implies a long term effect, through the stimulation of Rab27A expression by MITF that might facilitate melanosome interaction with MLPH-Slac2a or Slp2. In conclusion, MITF controls melanin synthesis through the regulation of tyrosinase, Tyrp1, and DCT expression and melanosome maturation via the regulation of GPR143 and Silver expression. The data gathered in the present report show that MITF also controls the peripheral distribution of melanosomes to the dendrites tips by regulating Rab27A expression. Thus MITF seems to organize the transmission of the differentiation signal and coordinates the transcriptional response, ensuring proper expression of essential genes for full functional melanocyte differentiation, pigmentation process, and UV adaptive response.

Recently, our group has shown that liver-specific inhibition of ACAT2 via antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated targeting likewise limits atherosclerosis. However, whether this atheroprotective effect was mediated by: 1) prevention of packaging of cholesterol into apoB-containing lipoproteins, 2) augmentation of nascent HDL cholesterol secretion, or 3) increased hepatobiliary sterol secretion was not examined. Therefore, the purpose of these studies was to determine whether hepatic ACAT2 is rate-limiting in all three of these important routes of cholesterol homeostasis. Liver-specific depletion of ACAT2 resulted in reduced packaging of cholesterol into apoB-containing lipoproteins (very low density lipoprotein, intermediate density lipoprotein, and low density lipoprotein), whereas high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels remained unchanged. In the liver of ACAT2 ASO-treated mice, cholesterol ester accumulation was dramatically reduced, yet there was no reciprocal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol. Paradoxically, ASO-mediated depletion of hepatic ACAT2 promoted fecal neutral sterol excretion without altering biliary sterol secretion. Interestingly, during isolated liver perfusion, ACAT2 ASO-treated livers had augmented secretion rates of unesterified cholesterol and phospholipid. Furthermore, we demonstrate that liver-derived cholesterol from ACAT2 ASO-treated mice is preferentially delivered to the proximal small intestine as a precursor to fecal excretion. Collectively, these studies provide the first insight into the hepatic itinerary of cholesterol when cholesterol esterification is inhibited only in the liver, and provide evidence for a novel non-biliary route of fecal sterol loss.

The central role of the liver in regulating both the production and clearance of circulating lipoprotein cholesterol is well recognized (reviewed in Refs. 1Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Biol.

However, hepatic cholesterol homeostasis is articulated through the interplay of many distinct pathways including de novo synthesis, delivery of dietary cholesterol from the intestine, biliary secretion, and secretion in nascent lipoproteins (1Dietschy J.M.

It has been demonstrated that the majority of cholesterol absorbed by the intestine is directed into the liver (5Turley S.D. Dietshcy J.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), where it not only affects de novo cholesterol synthesis, but also regulates cholesterol esterification and packaging into nascent lipoproteins (1Dietschy J.M.

Hence, when the amount of dietary cholesterol delivered by chylomicron remnants is low, de novo cholesterol synthesis is increased. In this case the liver uses this pool of cholesterol for normal functions such as membrane biogenesis, lipoprotein synthesis, and bile acid synthesis. However, when dietary cholesterol absorption is high the liver pool is expanded, resulting in reduction of de novo synthesis, and increased secretion of cholesterol in apoB-containing lipoproteins. Atherosclerosis can eventually result if these apoB-containing lipoproteins remain in the circulation for extended periods at high concentrations. Therefore, factors influencing intestinal absorption, chylomicron packaging, and hepatic retention of cholesterol are crucial in controlling hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Cholesterol esterification is intimately involved in all of these processes, and it is now appreciated that three distinct enzymes catalyze this reaction. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) 2The abbreviations used are: LCAT, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase; ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1; ACAT2, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 2; CE, cholesteryl ester; Cyp7α1, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase; FC, free cholesterol; HDL, high density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; LXR, liver X receptor; PL, phospholipid; SHP, small heterodimeric partner; TC, total cholesterol; TG, triglyceride; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; SI, small intestine; ASO, antisense oligonucleotide. acts exclusively in the plasma to esterify lipoprotein-associated cholesterol, whereas acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferases 1 (ACAT1) and 2 (ACAT2) are intracellular enzymes with distinct tissue distributions and functions (6Rudel L.L.

Importantly, the hepatic storage and secretion of CE into apoB-containing lipoproteins is virtually absent in mice lacking ACAT2 (9Lee R.G. Shah R. Sawyer J.K. Hamilton R.L. Parks J.S. Rudel L.L. J.

Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1814-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), indicating that ACAT2 is the sole cholesterol-esterifying enzyme in mouse liver. Collectively, these data point toward ACAT2 as a crucial regulator of both intestinal and hepatic cholesterol metabolism and ultimately atherosclerosis. However, the original total body model of ACAT2 deficiency (11Buhman K. Accad M. Novak S. Choi R. Wong J. Hamilton R. Turley S. Farese R. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) has left many unanswered questions regarding the relative importance of intestinal ACAT2 in promoting cholesterol absorption versus the role of hepatic ACAT2 in the packaging of CE into atherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins. To specifically address the role of ACAT2 in hepatic cholesterol metabolism we have successfully created an in vivo antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) liver targeting system (14Bell III, T.A. Brown J.M. Graham M.J. Lemonidis K.M. Crooke R.M. Rudel L.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1814-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Using this system, hepatic ACAT2 expression is depleted, whereas intestinal ACAT2 expression and intestinal cholesterol absorption is left undisturbed, thereby maintaining essentially normal amounts of intestinally absorbed cholesterol to the liver. Using this strategy we have previously demonstrated that liver-specific depletion of ACAT2 limits diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis (14Bell III, T.A. Brown J.M. Graham M.J. Lemonidis K.M. Crooke R.M. Rudel L.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1814-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, whether this atheroprotective effect was mediated by: 1) prevention of packaging of cholesterol into apoB-containing lipoproteins, 2) augmentation of nascent HDL cholesterol secretion, or 3) increased hepatobiliary sterol secretion was not examined. Therefore, using in vivo ASO-mediated reduction of hepatic ACAT2, the current study was undertaken to address the following question: under a moderate dietary cholesterol burden, what is the fate of hepatic cholesterol when it cannot be esterified? We originally suspected that targeted depletion of ACAT2-driven hepatic cholesterol esterification would prevent secretion of CE in atherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins into the plasma compartment, potentially augment HDL cholesterol levels, and stimulate the hepatobiliary secretion of cholesterol. Results from this study indicate that indeed liver-specific depletion of ACAT2 resulted in reduced packaging of CE into apoB-containing lipoproteins, yet had no effect on HDL cholesterol levels. Parodoxically, liver-specific depletion of ACAT2 resulted in increased fecal sterol loss without changes in biliary sterol excretion. This led us to examine the possibility of a novel non-biliary pathway (liver → plasma → small intestine → feces) for moving cholesterol out to the proximal small intestine when hepatic cholesterol esterification is compromised. Animals—Male apoB100-only, LDLr-/- mice harboring homozygous wild type (ACAT2+/+) or knock-out (ACAT2-/-) ACAT2 alleles were bred as previously described (16Bell III, T.A. Kelley K. Wilson M.D. Sawyer J.K. Rudel L.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All mice were on a mixed background (∼50% C57BL/6 and ∼50% 129Sv/Jae). Therefore, sibling controls were used and assignment to treatment groups was randomized to minimize effects of genetic heterogeneity. At 6 weeks of age, the mice were switched from a diet of rodent chow to a low fat (20% of energy as palm oil-enriched fat) and moderate cholesterol (0.1%, w/w), and randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. During the eight-week dietary regimen, mice were injected biweekly either saline, 25 mg/kg of a non-targeting ASO (control ASO; 5′-GTCGCTCAACATCTGAATCC-3′), or 25 mg/kg of an ASO targeting the knockdown of ACAT2 (ACAT2 ASO; 5′-TTCGGAAATGTTGCACCTCC-3′) as previously described (14Bell III, T.A.

The ACAT2 ASO used in the current study corresponds to ASO 6 from our previous report (14Bell III, T.A. Brown J.M. Graham M.J. Lemonidis K.M. Crooke R.M. Rudel L.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Because ACAT2 ASO-treated mice had significantly larger liver weights (6.1% of body weight), when compared with all other groups (4.67% in control ASO-treated mice and 4.02% in saline treated ACAT2-/- mice), lipid accumulation rate data are expressed as micrograms/ml/liver, and were not normalized to liver weight as previously described (9Lee R.G.

The second set of mice used for liver perfusion was treated more chronically (14–16 weeks) in an attempt to completely deplete the hepatic ACAT2 activity. In this set of mice liver perfusions were conducted as described above, but all sterol mass accumulation rates were determined by gas-liquid chromatography instead of enzymatic assays. Quantification of Non-biliary (Liver → Plasma → Intestine → Feces) Fecal Cholesterol Loss—All mice used for this protocol were treated for a period of 12–16 weeks with either a control (non-targeting) ASO or an ASO targeting the knockdown of ACAT2.

https://openalex.org/W2003164049,"A spontaneous mutation in Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) induces a defect in B-cell development that results in the immunodeficiency diseases X-linked agammaglobulinemia in humans and X-linked immunodeficiency (Xid) in mice. Here we show an unexpected role of Btk in osteoclast formation. When bone marrow cells derived from Xid mice were stimulated with receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand, an osteoclast differentiation factor, they did not completely differentiate into mature multinucleated osteoclasts. Moreover, we found that the defects appeared to occur at the stage in which mononuclear preosteoclasts fuse to generate multinucleated cells. Supporting this notion, macrophages from Xid mice also failed to form multinucleated foreign body giant cells. The fusion defect of the Xid mutant osteoclasts was caused by decreased expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), a master regulator of osteoclast differentiation, as well as reduced expression of various osteoclast fusion-related molecules, such as the d2 isoform of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase V0 domain and the dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein. This deficiency was completely rescued by the introduction of a constitutively active form of NFATc1 into bone marrow-derived macrophages. Our data provide strong evidence that Btk plays a critical role in osteoclast multinucleation by modulating the activity of NFATc1."

These interactions depend on the structures characterized by the sulfation pattern and isomer of uronic acid residues. One of the biosynthetic modifications of HS, namely 6-O-sulfation, is catalyzed by three isoforms of HS6-O-sulfotransferase. We generated HS6ST-1- and/or HS6ST-2-deficient mice (6ST1-KO, 6ST2-KO, and double knock-out (dKO)) that exhibited different phenotypes. We examined the effects of HS 6-O-sulfation in heparin-binding growth factor signaling using fibroblasts derived from these mutant mice. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) prepared from E14.5 dKO mice produced HS with little 6-O-sulfate, whereas 2-O-sulfation in HS from dKO-MEF (dKO-HS) was increased by 1.9-fold. HS6-O-sulfotransferase activity in the dKO-MEF was hardly detected, and HS2-O-sulfotransferase activity was 1.5-fold higher than that in wild type (WT)-MEFs. The response of dKO-MEFs to fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) was distinct from that of WT-MEFs; in dKO-MEFs, FGF-4- and FGF-2-dependent signalings were reduced to ∼30 and 60% of WT-MEFs, respectively, and FGF-1-dependent signaling was moderately reduced compared with that of WT-MEFs but only at the lower FGF-1 concentrations. Analysis with a surface plasmon resonance biosensor demonstrated that the apparent affinity of dKO-HS for FGF-4 was markedly reduced and was also reduced for FGF-1. In contrast, the affinity of dKO-HS for FGF-2 was 2.5-fold higher than that of HS from WT-MEFs. Thus, 6-O-sulfate in HS may regulate the signalings of some of HB-GFs, including FGFs, by inducing different interactions between ligands and their receptors.

These interactions regulate the activity, gradient formation, and stability of the corresponding ligands. Thus, HS has important functions in various developmental, morphogenic, physiological, and pathogenic processes (1Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu.

The polysaccharide of HS is synthesized by the alternative transfer of a glucuronic acid residue and an N-acetylglucosamine residue. It is then partially modified through the coordinate action of various enzymes in the Golgi apparatus, namely, N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases, C5-epimerase, and 2-O-, 6-O-, and 3-O-sulfotransferases to yield HS with a variety of structures (11Esko J.D.

The destruction of the Hs6st gene has been reported to cause the abnormal phenotypes by the perturbation of HB-GF-dependent signaling.

Thus, a line of evidence suggests that the 6-O-sulfate in HS plays a crucial role in development and regulates the functions of HB proteins, although the defects in HS6ST appear to vary in a species-dependent manner. Biochemical and crystal structure studies of FGF binding to HS/heparin and the formation of the ternary FGF ·FGF receptor (FGFR) ·HS complex have demonstrated that some of these interactions require the 6-O-sulfate residues of heparin/HS (25Pye D.A.

Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies have revealed that various FGF-FGFR pairs bind differentially to tissues; this phenomenon might reflect the preference structure of HS (7Allen B.L.

However, in vitro studies using oligosaccharides generated by the chemoenzymatic modification of heparin have indicated that the stability of FGF ·oligosaccharides ·FGFR complexes is correlated with the negative charge of the oligosaccharides rather than with the precise distribution of sulfate groups (30Jastrebova N.

We have previously demonstrated that mammals possess three HS6ST genes (known as HS6ST-1, -2, and -3) (31Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban K. Kimata K. J. Biol.

Although the in vitro substrate specificities of three isoforms partially overlap, each isoform exhibits a characteristic substrate preference. The expression patterns of three HS6ST isoforms also exhibit tissue- and development stage-specific variations (33Nogami K. Suzuki H. Habuchi H. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Kimata K. J. Biol.

The HS6ST-1-null mice die at E15.5, whereas the HS6ST-2-null mice survive and are fertile. However, dKO mice die at a slightly earlier stage than HS6ST-1-null mice, suggesting important roles of the preference structure of HS in the development of various tissues, which might result in the different survival rate. Although several HB proteins are involved in development, it remains poorly understood how HB-GF-inducible signaling is regulated in the response to the in vivo altered sulfation pattern of HS. In this study we isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from the skin of dKO mice (dKO-MEFs) and investigated the function of 6-O-sulfation of the HS chain in the FGF response. We demonstrated that HS from the dKO-MEFs has undetectable 6-O-sulfate residues and that the dKO-MEFs exhibit a differential response to FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-4, respectively. The results suggest important roles of 6-O-sulfation patterns at least in FGF signaling. Materials—Heparitinase I (Flavobacterium heparinum, EC 4.2.2.8.), heparitinase II (F. heparinum, no number assigned), and heparinase (F. heparinum, EC 4.2.2.7) completely desulfated N-sulfated (CDSNS)-heparin and an unsaturated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) disaccharides kit were obtained from Seikagaku Corp. Sensyu Pak Docosil was purchased from Sensyu Scientific. A silica-based polyamine (PAMN) column was from YMC. DEAE-Sephacel and Superose 6 columns were from Amersham Biosciences. H 352SO4 was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Hyaluronan (104, 27, and 10.4 kDa) as the standard for molecular mass analysis of the polysaccharides was from Seikagaku Corp. Recombinant human FGF-1 and FGF-4 were purchased from PeproTech and FGF-2 from PROGEN Biotechnik GmbH. The sensor chip SA was from BIAcore.

Kimata, manuscript in preparation. Isolation of Embryonic Fibroblasts—MEFs were isolated from 14.5-day normal, HS6ST-1–/–, HS6ST-2–/–, and dKO embryos. After the internal organs were removed from the trunks, the trunks were cut to small pieces and digested with 0.25% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA in PBS(–) for 10 min at 37 °C. The residues were repeatedly digested, and the supernatants were passed through a 100-μm mesh. The cells contained in the filtrate were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 10 min, and were subsequently grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). MEFs from the third passage were used. Preparation and Structural Analysis of HS—Subconfluent MEF layers in 100-mm dishes were washed with PBS(–) twice; the cells were collected with 2 ml of 0.2 m NaOH using a cell scraper. The cell suspending solution was incubated for 16 h at room temperature, neutralized with 4 m acetic acid, and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with DNase I, RNase A, and 10 mm MgCl2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Subsequently, 0.5 mg of Pronase (actinase E; Kaken-Seiyaku Corp., Tokyo) was added to the cell, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 16 h. The reaction was stopped by heating at 100 °C for 5 min, and the samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to remove any insoluble material. The supernatants were diluted with an equal volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) and loaded on a DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with the same buffer. The columns were washed with 10 column volumes of buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl and then eluted with 4 column volumes of 2 m NaCl in Tris-HCl buffer. The eluates were precipitated with 2.5 volumes of cold 95% (v/v) ethanol containing 1.3% (w/v) potassium acetate and 1 mm EDTA, and then the GAGs were recovered by centrifugation. An aliquot of the GAG was digested at 37 °C for 2 h with a mixture of 0.2 milliunits of heparitinase I, 0.1 milliunits of heparitinase II, and 0.2 milliunits of heparinase in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2), 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 μg of bovine serum albumin. After filtration of the digests with Ultrafree-MC (5,000 molecular weight limit; Millipore Corp.), the unsaturated disaccharide products in the filtrates were analyzed by reverse phase ion-pair chromatography using Senshu Pak column Docosil with a fluorescence detector according to Toyoda's method (33Nogami K. Suzuki H. Habuchi H. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8219-8229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with slightly modified elution conditions. To examine the molecular size of HS, the MEFs were incubated with 100 μCi/ml of 35S-inorganic sulfate for 24 h, and 35S-labeled GAGs were prepared as described above. An aliquot of the GAGs was digested with a heparitinase mixture and/or chondroitinase ABC and then subjected to gel chromatography on a Superose 6 column equilibrated with 0.2 m NH4OAc at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The disaccharide compositions of 35S-labeled chondroitin sulfate (CS) in the MEFs were analyzed by digesting them with chondroitinase ABC and then subjecting to polyamine-bound silica (PAMN) column chromatography as described previously. Assay for Sulfotransferase Activity—For the extraction of sulfotransferase from the MEFs, the cell layer was washed with PBS(–) and then scraped off the dish in 2 ml of buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 20% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitors (35Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After 1 h of gentle stirring, the homogenate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was used as the enzyme. Sulfotransferase activity was determined as described previously (31Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2859-2868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, the standard reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 2.5 μmol of imidazole HCl (pH 6.8), 3.75 μg of protamine chloride, 25 nmol (as hexosamine) of CDSNS-heparin, 50 pmol of [35S]3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (∼5 × 105 cpm), and cell extract containing 10 μg ofprotein. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by heating at 100 °C for 1 min. Next, 35S-labeled CDSNS-heparin was isolated by precipitation with 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate and 1 mm EDTA, followed by gel chromatography on a Fast desalting column. The isolated product was digested with a heparitinase mixture. The digests were subjected to PAMN column chromatography, and the amount of 35S-labeled disaccharides was measured using a scintillation counter. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount required to transfer 1 pmol of sulfate per min. Expression Levels of mRNA Encoding FGFRs, HS6STs, and HS2ST Analyzed by RT-PCR—Total RNA from WT- and dKO-MEFs was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). A reverse transcription reaction was performed using the high capacity cDNA archive kit (ABI) and 1.0 μg of total RNA as the template. The expression levels of Hs6st isoforms and Hs2st were semiquantitatively determined by RT-PCR using the following four primers pairs: Hs6st-1 forward primer (AGGACCATGGTTGAGCG) and reverse primer (GCGGCGATTGGGCCGATA); Hs6st-2 forward primer (CCGGTGCCGGATCCGTA) and reverse primer (GCGTCGCGCTTGCCATC); Hs6st-3 forward primer (CAACTTCGGGGAGCAGC) and reverse primer (TCCACGAAGCGGGTCAG); and Hs2st forward primer (TTCATGGGGCTCCTCAGG) and reverse primer (AAGCGCACCTGATCTTGC). The expression levels of mRNA encoding FGFR1b, FGFR1c, FGFR2b, FGFR2c, FGFR3, and FGFR4 were semiquantitatively determined by RT-PCR using the following six primers pairs: fgfr1-F forward primer (GTGGAACGATCTCCGCAC) and fgfr1b-R reverse primer (GCCACGCAGACTGGTTAG) for fgfr1b; fgfr1-F forward primer and fgfr1c-R reverse primer (CAGAGTGATGGGAGAGTC) for fgfr1c; fgfr2b-F forward primer (GATGTGGAGTTTGTCTGCAAGGTTT) and fgfr2b-R reverse primer (GACTGGTTGGCCTGCCCTATATAAT) for fgfr2b; fgfr2c-F forward primer (CAGCATCGGAGCCTTATTATGG) and fgfr2c-R reverse primer (GTTACATTCCGAATATAGAGAACC) for fgfr2c; fgfr3-F forward primer (GGGCTCCTTATTGGACTCG) and fgfr3-R forward primer (GCCGGATGCTGCCAAACT) for fgfr3; fgfr4-F forward primer (CACTGGCTCAAGGATGGA) and fgfr4-R reverse primer (CTACCCAGAGAGTTCTCC) for fgfr4; and GAPDH-F forward primer (GGTGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACG) and GAPDH-R reverse primer (GCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG) for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The PCR was carried out in a final volume of 25 μl containing 12.5 pmol of each primer and 2-μl aliquots of reverse transcriptase reaction mixture under the condition of 37 cycles for Hs6sts and Hs2st or 35 cycles for fgfrs, denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 56.5 °C for 30 s for Hs6sts and Hs2st or 56 °C for fgfrs, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR products were subjected to 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The data were obtained from three independent experiments. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—The interaction of growth factors with HS was analyzed using a BIAcore 1000 surface plasmon resonance biosensor. A streptavidin-conjugated sensor Chip SA was used to immobilize the HS prepared from the WT- and dKO-MEFs. Next, 5 μg of HS or heparin was incubated with 5.6 μg of NHS-LS-Biotin (Pierce) in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) for 30 min at room temperature. An excess of NHS-LS-Biotin was reacted with 0.1 m ethanolamine for 30 min at room temperature. The biotinylated GAGs were precipitated with 3 volumes of cold 95% (v/v) ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate and 1 mm EDTA, and the process was then repeated to remove any unreacted biotin. The precipitates from HS preparation were digested with 5 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC for 10 min at 37 °C to degrade CS. After the reaction was stopped by heating at 95 °C for 2 min, biotinylated HS was recovered by precipitation with 3 volumes of cold 95% (v/v) ethanol containing 1.3% (w/v) potassium acetate and 1 mm EDTA. 0.5–2 μg/ml biotinylated GAGs in PBST were injected at the constant flow rate of 5 μl/min. The biotinylated heparin and WT- or dKO-HS, of ∼10 and 700 resonance units, respectively, were immobilized onto a streptavidin-conjugated sensor chip SA. Various concentrations of growth factors in PBST were perfused at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The sensor chip was regenerated with injection of 2 m NaCl/PBST. All measurements were carried out at room temperature. At least two independent experiments were performed. Resonance data from sensorgrams were evaluated using the BIAevaluation software (version 2) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dissociation constant (KD) for binding was calculated by Scatchard plot analysis. The response at equilibrium, Req (y axis) was plotted against Req/C (X axis), where C was the molar concentration of growth factor. The slope of this plot equals–KD. Preparation of Digoxigenin-conjugated FGFs—Digoxigenin-conjugated FGF was prepared as described previously (36Ashikari S. Habuchi H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29586-29593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, 10 μg of FGF-2 or FGF-1 was added in 500 μl of 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.5), containing 50 μg of N-acetylated heparin and then mixed with 8.75 nmol of digoxigenin-3-O-methylcarbonyl-ϵ-aminocaproic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Roche Applied Science) in ethanol, followed by 2 h at room temperature. The 1 ml of heparin-Sepharose gel equilibrated with PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA (solution A) was added into FGF mixture and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The column was washed with 5 ml of solution A and then eluted with 1 ml of solution A containing 2 m NaCl and 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 to recover the digoxigenin-conjugated FGFs (Dig-FGFs). Pulldown Assay—To examine the interaction between FGF and FGFR1c with or without various glycosaminoglycans, 20 ng of Dig-FGF-1 or Dig-FGF-2 and 50 ng of FGFR1c-Fc (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were mixed in 500 μl of pulldown buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 tablet/10 ml of Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science)) containing various glycosaminoglycans. After the incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads were added into the mixtures and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. To remove Dig-FGFs from the ternary complex (Dig-FGFs ·FGFR1c-Fc ·HS), the beads were washed with 2 m NaCl in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5). Then they were washed with PBS two times and suspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. Western blots were probed with an anti-digoxigenin antibody. Analysis of FGFs Signaling—MEFs (1 × 105) were seeded in 24-well plates. After incubation in DMEM containing 0.4% FBS for 18 h, the cells were washed with fresh serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% BSA (medium A) and incubated for an additional 24 h. Different concentrations of FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-4 were added into the wells in duplicate. After incubation at 37 °C for exactly 5 min, the medium was immediately discarded and 0.5 ml of LIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3PO4, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 tablet/10 ml of Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science)) was added to the cell layers. After the cells were frozen in a refrigerator at –80 °C, cells lysates were prepared at 4 °C for 60 min with rotation and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Then 30 μg of protein was subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Western blots were probed with antibodies against phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-FGFR1, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and ECL detection was performed using Western Lighting Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and x-ray film (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The band density of pERK1/2 or pFGFR1 was measured using ImageGauge software and normalized by actin bands. The data were obtained from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Digestion of Cell Surface/Extracellular Matrix HS or CS—The WT-MEFs were digested with 10 milliunits of heparitinase I, 5 milliunits of heparitinase II, and 10 milliunits of heparinase and/or 10 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC at 37 °C before the addition of FGFs. After 15 min, the enzyme and the digested HS or CS were removed by washing twice with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA, and the cells were then stimulated as described above. Assay of DNA Synthesis—MEFs (1 × 104) were seeded in 96-well plates, and incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% BSA for 48 h. Different concentrations of FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-4, and BrdUrd labeling solution were added into the wells in duplicate. After further incubation for 24 h, BrdUrd incorporated to DNA was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Characterization of HS Isolated from MEF—We isolated fibroblasts from WT, HS6ST-1–/–, HS6ST-2–/–, and HS6ST-1–/–/HS6ST-2–/– mice at E14.5 (designed WT-MEFs, 6ST1KO-MEFs, 6ST2KO-MEFs, and dKO-MEFs, respectively). We first measured the expression levels of Hs6st-1, Hs6st-2, and Hs6st-3 mRNA in WT-MEFs using semiquantitative RT-PCR with equal concentration of the plasmids containing each cDNA as a standard template (Fig. 1). The transcription level of Hs6st-2 RNA was the highest, and the expression level of Hs6st-3 mRNA (∼40% of Hs6st-2 mRNA) was the lowest. We then examined the structure of HS prepared from the four MEFs (Fig. 2). The analysis of the disaccharide compositions in HS revealed that compared with the WT-HS, 6-O-sulfation in the HS isolated from 6ST1KO-MEF (6ST1KO-HS) was decreased in GlcNAc6SO4 residue (70% of WT-HS), HexA-GlcNSO3(6SO4) unit (74%), and HexA(2SO4)-GlcNSO3(6SO4) unit (82%). In contrast, 6-O-sulfation in the HS isolated from 6ST2KO-MEF (6ST2KO-HS) was markedly decreased in GlcNAc6SO4 residue (33%) and HexA-GlcNSO3(6SO4) unit (21%) but was moderately decreased in He"
https://openalex.org/W2009991551,"Angiogenesis in neuroblastoma (NB) correlates with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and a worse clinical outcome. Other cellular markers, such as Akt activation and MYCN amplification, are also associated with poor prognosis in NB; therefore, we sought to determine the role of N-myc in the regulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/VEGF pathway. PI3K inhibition, using small-molecule inhibitors or phosphatase and tensin homolog adenovirus, led to decreased levels of VEGF mRNA and/or protein by reducing phosphorylation of Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and attenuating hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha expression. Moreover, PI3K inhibition decreased levels of N-myc expression in MYCN-amplified cells. To further clarify the importance of N-myc as a target of PI3K in VEGF regulation, we inhibited N-myc expression by siRNA transfection. MYCN siRNA significantly blocked VEGF secretion, irrespective of serum conditions, in MYCN-amplified NB cells; this effect was enhanced when combined with rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor. Interestingly, in cells with low-N-myc expression, MYCN siRNA reduction of VEGF secretion was only effective with MYCN overexpression or insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulation. Our results show that N-myc plays an important role in the PI3K-mediated VEGF regulation in NB cells. Targeting MYCN, as a novel effector of PI3K-mediated angiogenesis, has significant potential for the treatment of highly vascularized, malignant NB."

To understand the process of synaptic transmission, it is of outstanding importance to know the properties of the fusion pore and how these properties affect the release process. Many proteins have been implicated in vesicle fusion; however, there is little evidence for proteins involved in fusion pore expansion. Myosin II has been shown to participate in the transport of vesicles and, surprisingly, in the final phases of exocytosis, affecting the kinetics of catecholamine release in adrenal chromaffin cells as measured by amperometry. Here, we have studied single vesicle exocytosis in chromaffin cells overexpressing an unphosphorylatable form (T18AS19A RLC-GFP) of myosin II that produces an inactive protein by patch amperometry. This method allows direct determination of fusion pore expansion by measuring its conductance, whereas the release of catecholamines is recorded simultaneously by amperometry. Here we demonstrated that the fusion pore is of critical importance to control the release of catecholamines during single vesicle secretion in chromaffin cells. We proved that myosin II acts as a molecular motor on the fusion pore expansion by hindering its dilation when it lacks the phosphorylation sites.

Exocytosis is a fundamental cellular mechanism used by neurons and hormone-secreting cells to interact with each other and to influence their environment through the release of neurotransmitters and hormones. These chemical signals are disposed to the extracellular medium in the form of quanta, as vesicles containing transmitter fuse with the plasma membrane and release their cargo. Release occurs through the exocytotic fusion pore, which is the water channel connecting the vesicle interior to the extracellular space. The dynamics of the fusion pore have been mainly investigated at the level of single cells by two techniques: patch clamp measurements of the electrical capacitance of the cell membrane (1Neher E.

Nature. 1992; 356: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Whereas patch clamp detects changes of cell membrane area and conductance caused by vesicular fusion, the electrochemical method analyzes quantitatively the release of catecholamines from each exocytotic event. The combination of whole cell capacitance measurements and amperometry showed that during fusion pore opening there is a small release of neurotransmitter preceding the amperometric spike that is directly proportional to the pore conductance (6Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernandez-Chacon R. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Because then, this signal, the prespike foot (PSF) 2The abbreviations used are: PSF, prespike foot; CA, catecholamine; CFE, carbon fiber electrode; RLC, regulatory light chain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type; PKC, protein kinase C. has been considered an indicative of the lifetime of the early fusion pore (7Amatore C. Arbault S. Bonifas I. Guille M. Lemaitre F. Verchier Y. Biophys. Chem. 2007; 129: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Later on, higher resolution experiments in rat mast cells by using the patch amperometry technique demonstrated that the size of the fusion pore does not limit release during the upstroke of the amperometric spike (8Tabares L. Lindau M. Alvarez de Toledo G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 837-841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is accepted that the spike phase corresponds to the fast and massive release of transmitters out of the vesicular matrix after the fusion of cell and vesicular membranes. In neurons and neuroendocrine cells it has not been possible to report the fusion pore dynamics during the bulk release of the amperometric spike. The role of the fusion pore has been inferred from amperometric recordings alone (9Barclay J.W. Aldea M. Craig T.J. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol.

Cytoskeletal proteins play an important role organizing the transport of vesicles to release sites (15Dillon C. Goda Y. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 25-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). During stimulation, calcium influx induces a dynamic reorganization of the cortical actin network and facilitates exocytosis (16Trifaro J.M. Vitale M.L.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2871-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that such transport is based in molecular motors associated with F-actin trails and conduct vesicles along regions with different F-actin organization. More recently, a new role implicating the regulation of single fusion kinetics has been also suggested (20Neco P. Giner D. Viniegra S. Borges R. Villarroel A. Gutierrez L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27450-27457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In that way, myosin II has been postulated to exert a tensional pressure in the F-actin network that could affect membrane tension, fusion pore expansion, or the final extrusion of vesicular contents. In the present work, by using the technique of patch amperometry, we directly determined in chromaffin cells the effect of a protein on the fusion pore dynamics for the first time. This method allowed us to resolve single fusion events from vesicles smaller than 500 nm in diameter by simultaneous measurement of the patch membrane capacitance and the release of catecholamines by placing a carbon fiber detector inside the patch pipette. Single-vesicle exocytosis has been determined in rat chromaffin cells infected by modified herpes virus (amplicons) containing the myosin II regulatory light chain (RLC) or an unphosphorylatable form that produces inactive protein (T18A/S19A RLC) chimeras with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Therefore, by direct measurement of fusion pore conductance by admittance methods, we proved that myosin II plays an essential role in fusion pore expansion during exocytosis. Chromaffin Cell Preparation and Infection—Rat chromaffin cells were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats (100-200 g) and cultured as described previously (21Gullo F. Ales E. Rosati B. Lecchi M. Masi A. Guasti L. Cano-Abad M.F. Arcangeli A. Lopez M.G. Wanke E. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were plated on 35-mm dishes coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2, 95% O2 saturated with water. After 24 h, the primary cultures were infected with a herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) amplicon containing wild type or mutant forms of RLC-GFP constructs obtained as described previously (20Neco P.

The dilution chosen for the experiments (20-30 μl of virus/1 ml of medium) produced around 10% infection efficiency. GFP fluorescence was observed 1 day after infection and persisted, at least, along the two following days. Patch amperometry experiments were carried out between days 1-3 after culture at room temperature (25 °C). Reagents and Solutions—The bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, and 5-10 mm glucose. The pH was adjusted to 7.3, and the osmolarity was around 300 mmol/kg. The pipette solution contained 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm TEA-Cl, 135 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm BaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES/NaOH. Patch Amperometry—Changes in membrane capacitance and catecholamine release were recorded simultaneously by patch amperometry (22Ales E. Tabares L. Poyato J.M. Valero V. Lindau M. Alvarez de Toledo G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 23Albillos A. Dernick G. Horstmann H. Almers W. Alvarez de Toledo G. Lindau M. Nature. 1997; 389: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell-attached patch clamp was achieved with a carbon fiber electrode (CFE) introduced into the patch pipette. A special holder with two Ag/AgCl electrodes was used. The CFE was prepared from 5-μm-diameter carbon fibers as described previously (24Chow R.H. Klingauf J. Neher E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12765-12769Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The pipette electrode was connected to ground, whereas the CFE was connected to the I/V converter of a homemade amperometric amplifier via a 3 m KCl solution. The CFE was continuously held at +800 mV. Amperometric currents were filtered with an 8-pole low pass Bessel filter set at 3 KHz. Patch pipettes were pulled in three stages with a programmable puller (P-97; Sutter Instruments) and coated with a silicone compound (Sylgard 184; Dow Corning). The pipettes were fire-polished and had a typical resistance in the bath of ∼2 mΩ. Pipette resistance typically increased up to 3-4 MΩ when the carbon fiber approached the tip opening. We subtracted the constant direct current level in the CFE to calculate the time integral of the amperometric signal. We used a patch clamp amplifier (EPC-7; HEKA-Elektronik) for cell-attached capacitance measurements. Command voltage was applied to the bath. Changes of patch admittance were measured as described previously (1Neher E. Marty A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6712-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 25Lollike K. Borregaard N. Lindau M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) with a lock-in amplifier (SR830; Stanford Research Systems) using a sine wave amplitude of 50 mV (root mean square) at a frequency of 20 KHz. The output filter was set to a 1- or 3-ms time constant, 24 db. Data acquisition and analysis were done with a 16 bit A/D converter (6052-E National Instruments) with locally written software. Fusion pore openings were analyzed as described previously (25Lollike K. Borregaard N. Lindau M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Pore conductance (Gp) was calculated from the real (Re) and imaginary (Im) parts of the admittance after base-line subtraction: Gp = (Re2 + Im2)/Re. Data Analysis—We analyzed from each single exocytotic event the following parameters: Step, Delay CA, Delay CP, RT, Halfwidth, and Charge (Scheme 1). Step reflects the area of fused vesicle, Delay CA shows the latency to bulk release, Delay CP is the latency to the peak, and Peak indicates the highest concentration of CA reaching the electrode tip. The RT (the time required to reach the peak amplitude) and Halfwidth (duration of amperometric spike at half its height) may indicate the speed of CA release during the fusion pore expansion. Individual spike and capacitance step processing was performed using macros for IGOR (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), allowing for peak/step detection, integration, and kinetic parameter calculations. The Student's t test for unpaired samples was used to establish statistical significance among the different experimental data (samples were considered significantly different when p < 0.05). All of the data were expressed as the means ± S.E. from experiments performed in a number (n) of individual cells. The presented data represent experiments performed with cells from at least three different cultures. Monte Carlo Simulation of Release Events—Patch amperometry measurements only include contributions from exocytotic events occurring in the patch of membrane under the patch pipette. Because of the homogenous geometry in patch amperometry experiments, amperometric responses are rather constant. We calculated the amperometric response expected from a regular chromaffin granule from a measured fusion pore by Monte Carlo methods. We assumed that the spike morphology is influenced by three different processes: 1) release of molecules from the vesicular matrix, 2) diffusion of molecules through the exocytotic fusion pore, and 3) diffusion of molecules into the patch pipette (accounting for pipette and carbon fiber geometry). The random walk procedure was used to simulate diffusion (both on the vesicle and the extracellular space) of randomly distributed molecules in the vesicle (2Haller M. Heinemann C. Chow R.H. Heidelberger R. Neher E. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2100-2113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The simulation employed dimensions characteristic of the pipette and electrode and those measured of the fusion pore conductance. The diffusion coefficient was that of catecholamines inside the vesicle and in free solution (26Gerhardt G.A. Adams R.N. Anal. Chem. 1982; 54: 2618-2620Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 27Amatore C. Bouret I. Midrier L. Chem. Eur. J. 1999; 5: 2151-2162Crossref Google Scholar). The electrode was evaluated as a disc above the patch inside the pipette, and the concentration at the surface of the disc was set to zero to simulate amperometry. In each instant, a number of oxidizable molecules (given by matrix dissociation) were assumed to diffuse in the vesicle, to escape through the fusion pore, and to diffuse in the surrounding medium. The molecules also were assumed to be reflected, when hitting the cell surface, the pipette, or the cylindrical face of the carbon fiber, or to be absorbed, when hitting the disc-like tip of the carbon fiber. Absorbed particles were assumed to contribute equally to amperometric current. Delayed Release after Vesicle Fusion in Cells Expressing the Unphosphorylatable GFP-RLC—To simultaneously measure membrane fusion and release of catecholamines in chromaffin cells, we have used patch amperometry (23Albillos A. Dernick G. Horstmann H. Almers W. Alvarez de Toledo G. Lindau M. Nature. 1997; 389: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). This method uses a CFE inside the path-pipette, detecting exocytotic events occurring at the membrane patch and releasing their contents into the pipette. In addition to the simultaneous measurement of capacitance changes caused by single chromaffin granules and the associated release of catecholamines, patch amperometry allows for a detailed characterization of the dynamics of the fusion pore by off-line admittance analysis (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). We have recorded green fluorescent cells, corresponding to those efficiently infected cells (Fig. 1A, top panel). Sample traces recorded on cells overexpressing the WT RLC-GFP and the unphosphorylatable T18A/S19A RLC-GFP are shown in Fig. 1 (B and C), respectively. The top traces illustrate step increments in patch membrane capacitance because of the irreversible fusion of single chromaffin granules with the plasma membrane. The bottom traces show amperometric spikes representing CA detection with a CFE placed inside the patch pipette. Every step increase in capacitance was accompanied by an amperometric spike in both experimental conditions, which reflects release of vesicular contents through the fusion pore. In conventional extracellular amperometry, detected spikes originated over the whole cell surface area, giving rise to a wide distribution of spike characteristics caused by CA diffusion. In patch amperometry all of the events detected displayed a rather constant kinetics mostly dependent on the fusion pore lifetime and/or matrix dissociation. Most capacitance changes corresponded to step increases in cell surface area as chromaffin granules fused irreversibly with the plasma membrane. We did not observe differences in the step size distribution in WT RLC-GFP and T18A/S19A RLC-GFP-overexpressing cells (1.11 ± 0.05 fF versus 1.00 ± 0.09 fF, n = 112, eleven cells and n = 73, eight cells, respectively). These values are not either significant different from the average step size for nontransfected cells (1.17 ± 0.06 fF, n = 95) (Fig. 1D) and similar to that previously published in rat chromaffin cells (1.13 ± 0.03 fF) (22Ales E. Tabares L. Poyato J.M. Valero V. Lindau M. Alvarez de Toledo G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), indicating that overexpression of either the active form or “null” form of myosin II does not interfere with the formation or ability of chromaffin granules to undergo exocytosis. The delay between the onset of the capacitance jump and the beginning of the amperometric spike (delay CA) reflects the time required for fusion pore expansion and release of CA. Our experiments showed a longer latency between the capacitance step and the beginning of the amperometric spike in cells expressing the mutant form of myosin II (10.4 ± 1.4 ms) as compared with the wild type protein (7.2 ± 0.7 ms) (Fig. 1E). This effect is more pronounced considering the delay between the onset of the capacitance step and the peak of the spike (delay CP), the time point where the CA concentration reach the maximum value (18.9 ± 1.1 ms in WT RLC-GFP cells versus 25 ± 2.3 ms in T18A/S19A RLC-GFP cells), suggesting delayed fusion pore expansion before bulk CA are released. The delay CA is the stage where the PSF can be observed in the amperometric trace. However, we could hardly detect amperometric feet, probably because of the distance at which the detector is placed from the cell surface in patch amperometry experiments (∼5 μm). Moreover, no clear differences were found in the number of PSF detected in WT RLC-GFP and T18A/S19A RLC-GFP cells (5% versus 7%). To quantify the initial phase of fusion pore opening, we performed off-line analysis of the Imaginary and Real traces of the admittance. The spike rise time and the time at the half-height (halfwidth) for the unphosphorylatable mutant were characterized by larger values of 10.38 ± 1.40 and 79.14 ± 5.35 ms, respectively, compared with 7.20 ± 0.69 and 67.60 ± 4.22 ms for wild type RLC construct. However, there was no significant difference in the mean catecholamine content released in cells expressing both constructs (Q = 4.6 ± 0.36 pC in WT RLC-GFP and 5.2 ± 0.52 pC in T18A/S19A RLC-GFP). Fusion Pores Are Reluctant to Expand in Cells Expressing the Mutated Form of RLC-GFP—To analyze the hypothesis that the slower rate of vesicle discharge in T18A/S19A RLC-GFP-expressing cells directly depends on the kinetics of the exocytotic fusion pore, we calculated the time course of the fusion pore conductance. Fig. 2A represents the electrical equivalent circuit of a fusing vesicle, in which the fusion pore is represented by a variable conductance (Gp) in series with the vesicle capacitance (Cv) contributed by the vesicle membrane. Current through this circuit flows on fusion pore formation and expansion. The changes in both Gp and Cv can be quantified off-line by analysis of the real and imaginary parts of the admittance (25Lollike K. Borregaard N. Lindau M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28Spruce A.E. Breckenridge L.J. Lee A.K. Almers W. Neuron. 1990; 4: 643-654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Traces in Fig. 2 (B and C) show the fusion pore conductance during two exocytotic events, accompanied by release of CA in a spike-like form in WT RLC-GFP and T18A/S19A RLC-GFP-expressing cells, respectively. In the WT RLC-GFP event (Fig. 2B), the conductance of the pore rises rapidly, reaching a maximum value of ∼600 pS in about 15 ms. In the mutant T18A/S19A RLC-GFP (Fig. 2C), the conductance grew at a slower pace (30 ms), reaching only a maximum detectable value of ∼200 pS. In both experimental conditions, the fusion pore expanded abruptly and undetectably by our method after reaching the maximum value. The CA signal during fusion pore expansion was slightly different in WT and the double mutant T18A/S19A RLC-GFP. We did not observe a visible amperometric foot during fusion pore expansion. However, the amperometric spike showed a distinct time course as compared with the fusion pore conductance. In both cases, WT and T18A/S19A RLC-GFP, the onset of the amperometric spike occurred when the fusion pore conductance reached ∼200 pS. However, the amperometric spike developed at different rates regardless of the fusion pore conductance measured in WT and T18A/S19A RLC-GFP. The time course of fusion pore conductance for 15 WT and 14 mutant vesicles are shown in Fig. 2 (D and G). Most WT cells fusion pores grew up to 300 pS (Fig. 2D). However, cells expressing the mutations consistently showed pore sizes lower than 300 pS (Fig. 2G). In addition, the lifetime of the fusion pore in cells expressing the WT construct has a mean value of 16.9 ± 2.09 ms and in cells expressing the double mutation of 23.18 ± 3.2 ms (Log rank test, p = 0.055). The mean maximum pore conductance obtained was ∼950 pS in WT RLC-GFP cells and ∼200 pS in T18A/S19A RLC-GFP cells. The rate of fusion pore expansion as determined from the slope of Gp in its linear part, was 98.54 ± 55.01 nS s-1 (n = 14) in WT RLC-GFP pores and 14.40 ± 5.34 nS s-1 in T18A/S19A RLC-GFP pores (n = 15). A cumulative histogram of the maximum conductance (Gp max) achieved for all pores in WT cells revealed that more than 50% of the pores displayed maximum conductance values over 300 pS, indicating a continuous expansion of the fusion pore up to 1000 pS, expanding fully to undetectable values of Gp afterward (Fig. 2E). However, mutant cells revealed a cumulative histogram of maximum conductance values under 400 pS (Fig. 2F). The cumulative histogram of pore open times, as measured by the time in which the Gp max value is reached, revealed that over 80% of the pores in WT cells has already opened in 20 ms; meanwhile in mutant cells only a 40% of the pores open in the same time period of 20 ms (Fig. 2, H and I). These results indicate that the expression of T18A/S19A RLC-GFP mutations leads to a slow expansion of the fusion pore with lower conductance values, to finally explode open to release the bulk contents of the secretory vesicle. To further explore the role of myosin on fusion pore expansion, we analyzed the rates of Gp changes in both experimental conditions (Fig. 3). We characterized the different phases in expansion of the fusion pore during exocytosis. The conductance time course of fusion pores analyzed in Fig. 2 (B and C) are comparatively shown in Fig. 3A. Fig. 3B shows the typical behavior of the fusion pore dynamics from a cell expressing the WT RLC-GFP. We can observe at least two expansion phases. First, there is a low conductance phase. This early stage is well fitted to a linear function. The next stages can be fitted to sigmoid functions with increasing slopes (Fig. 3, B and C). Typically the last phase was absent in cells expressing the T18A/S19A RLC-GFP construct (Fig. 3C), but the first phase (19.77 ± 1.82 ms) and the subsequent expansion phase (13.05 ± 1.24 ms) tended to be longer (Fig. 3D) than those relative to the WT RLC-GFP cells (first phase = 13.02 ± 2.04 ms and second phase = 7.13 ± 1.07 ms). On the other hand, during the initial linear expansion of the fusion pore the net increment of Gp tended to be higher in the mutants (102.16 ± 19.63 pS) (Fig. 3E) than in cells expressing the wild type construct (31.94 ± 14.25 pS). However, despite the also increased duration of the second phase of pore expansion, the Gp increment was indistinguishable in wild type (127.3 ± 15 pS) and mutated (137.7 ± 22 pS) cells. Fusion Pore Expansion Affects the Kinetics of CA Release during the Amperometric Spike—We could correlate fusion pore conductance with the kinetics of neurotransmitter release from the same fusion event. Recently, it has been reported that the initial fusion pore conductance determines the flux of catecholamines during foot signals (29Gong L.W. de Toledo G.A. Lindau M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, it is still a matter of debate how the fusion pore affects release during the upstroke of the amperometric spike. To understand how the properties of the fusion pores affect the spikes kinetic, we have compared the maximum pore conductance and the spike rise time in the exocytotic events from the same experiment in cells expressing the wild type RLC-GFP and the T18A/S19A RLC-GFP constructs. We observed that spikes with faster rise time (less than 15 ms) are associated with large pores (Fig. 4A). However, when the fusion pores attains a conductance lower than 500 pS, the spike rise develops at a slower pace. We compare the spike rise time with the lifetime of the fusion pore. Interestingly, we find a linear relation between these two parameters in the wild type (Fig. 4B) and in the double mutant (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that the size of the fusion pore and the time required to expand the fusion pore are important determinants of the kinetics of CA release and influence at least the rise phase of the amperometric spike. Because the kinetic parameters of the amperometric spike and the spike rise time in the T18AS19A RLC-GFP type were slower than in the RLC-GFP wild type, our data suggest that myosin II participates controlling fusion pore expansion; the mutation that prevents phosphorylation of the molecule retards the expansion of the fusion pore and, as consequence, delays quantal neurotransmitter release. Monte Carlo Simulations Explain Experimental Data and Suggest That a Late Fusion Pore Still Controls CA Release during the Decay of the Amperometric Spike—Experimentally it has not been possible to measure the fusion pore conductance during the decay phase of the amperometric spike from a fusing vesicle. To further study the role of fusion pore and myosin II at this stage, we modeled amperometric spikes by entering realistic values of fusion pore expansion in the simulation. Modeling was carried out assuming three different steps in the exocytotic process: release through the exocytotic fusion pore, transmitter release from matrix dissociation, and diffusion of molecules into the path pipette. Visual Basic and Igor software were used to generate Monte Carlo simulation and to account for the relationship between fusion pore expansion time and the amperometric spike kinetics. Simulations of different fusion pores sizes, assuming they do not expand during exocytosis, show that the kinetic properties of spikes are strongly affected (Fig. 5A). To obtain a realistic vision of fusion pore behavior, experimental Gp traces were used to simulate amperometric spikes (Fig. 5B). Simulated currents fitted nicely the time course of the rise time of the amperometric spike until values of fusion pore conductance"
https://openalex.org/W2002577396,"Ena/VASP (vasodialator-stimulated protein) proteins regulate many actin-dependent events, including formation of protrusive structures, fibroblast migration, neurite extension, cell-cell adhesion, and Listeria pathogenesis. In vitro, Ena/VASP activities on actin are complex and varied. They promote actin assembly, protect filaments from cappers, bundle filaments, and inhibit filament branching. To determine the mechanisms by which Ena/VASP proteins regulate actin dynamics at barbed ends, we monitored individual actin filaments growing in the presence of VASP and profilin using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Filament growth was unchanged by VASP, but filaments grew faster in profilin-actin and VASP than with profilin-actin alone. Actin filaments were captured directly by VASP-coated surfaces via interactions with growing barbed ends. End-attached filaments transiently paused but resumed growth after becoming bound to the surface via a filament side attachment. Thus, Ena/VASP proteins promote actin assembly by interacting directly with actin filament barbed ends, recruiting profilin-actin, and blocking capping."

In this study we prepared a series of heparin oligosaccharides according to their size and sulfation level. We then investigated their affinity for FGF2 and their ability to support FGF2 mitogenesis of heparan sulfate-deficient cells expressing FGFR1c. Tetra- and hexasaccharides bound FGF2, but failed to dimerize the growth factor. Nevertheless, these saccharides promoted FGF2-mediated cell growth. Furthermore, whereas enzymatic removal of the non-reducing end 2-O-sulfate group had little effect on the 1:1 interaction with FGF2, it eliminated the mitogenic activity of these saccharides. This evidence supports the symmetric two-end model of ternary complex formation. In contrast, even at very low concentrations, octasaccharide and larger heparin fragments conferred a potent mitogenic activity that was independent of terminal 2-O-sulfation. This correlated with the ability to dimerize FGF2 in an apparently cooperative manner. This data suggests that potent mitogenic signaling results from heparin-mediated trans-dimerization of FGF2, consistent with the asymmetric model of ternary complex formation.

A wide variety of cells express FGF1 and FGF2, for example, vascular smooth muscle cells, neurons, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts (3Botta M. Manetti F. Corelli F. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000; 6: 1897-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). FGF2 can also be released by macrophages in response to inflammation (4Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7529) Google Scholar) or by platelets in response to vessel injury (5Browder T. Folkman J. Pirie-Shepherd S. J. Biol.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is important in human disease; it is induced by malignant tumors, and is a cause of arthritis and visual impairment in diabetic retinopathies. Tumors secrete pro-angiogenic molecules, such as the FGFs, in an autocrine or paracrine manner, and increased FGF levels are associated with poor prognosis for many cancers (2Powers C.J.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans are membrane-associated co-receptors that coordinate the interaction of FGFs with their high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptors, the FGFRs (8Eswarakumar V.P. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). These high-affinity receptors are the products of distinct mammalian genes: FGFR1 (flg), FGFR2 (bek), FGFR3, and FGFR4. FGFR1–3 can be alternatively spliced to produce a, b, and c isoforms. The a isoform is secreted and may function as a soluble receptor antagonist (9Duan D.S. Werner S. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16076-16080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The b and c receptor variants are particularly important as they display different ligand binding specificities and affinities (10Zhang X. Ibrahimi O.A. Olsen S.K. Umemori H. Mohammadi M. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15694-15700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). For example, FGFR2c was reported to bind FGF1 and FGF2 with equal affinity, whereas FGFR2b bound FGF2 with a thousand-fold lower affinity than FGF1 (11Dell K.R. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21225-21229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the expression of b and c FGFR isoforms can be “reversibly switched” by the influence of FGF1 or FGF2 (12Scotet E. Houssaint E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Aberrant receptor switching has been reported to be involved in the progression of certain tumors (13Yan G. Fukabori Y.

The interaction of HS proteoglycans with FGFs provides a physiological mechanism for regulation of FGF signaling. The ability of HS- or heparin-derived saccharides to recognize different FGFs depends on their size and sulfation pattern. Crystal structures show that FGF1 and FGF2 interact with 4–5 sugar residues within short heparin oligosaccharides (14DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I. Svahn C.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J.

Variations in the FGF receptor subtypes expressed by different cells also influence the saccharide requirements for FGF-mediated cell growth (19Ostrovsky O. Berman B. Gallagher J. Mulloy B.

However, for each FGF·FGFR combination the optimum location of sulfate groups upon activatory saccharides is unclear. Indeed, there is some dispute in the literature on whether the overriding influence is the sulfate density of the saccharides or the sulfate patterning (22Gallagher J.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 23Kreuger J. Spillmann D. Li J.P. Lindahl U. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Two crystal structures of FGF·FGFR·heparin ternary complexes have been published, which are predicted to form at different sites upon HS chains (24Pellegrini L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The symmetrical 2:2:2 FGF·FGFR·saccharide complex (25Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) involves two saccharide chains that terminate at the center of the structure, and so this species could form only on the non-reducing ends of two separate but proximal HS chains (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the asymmetrical 2:2:1 complex (26Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) is formed around a single saccharide and could therefore assemble internally upon HS chains (Fig. 1B). However, the two FGF·FGFR half-complexes in the asymmetrical structure make no significant protein-protein interactions and so are reliant on the probability that they become aligned on opposite faces of the same short stretch of HS. This might be achieved through induction of favorable local conformational changes in the saccharide; indeed, there is strong evidence for the existence of this in solution (27Harmer N.J. Ilag L.L. Mulloy B. Pellegrini L. Robinson C.V. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A comparison of the two ternary complex structures demonstrates that a similar substructure exists in both crystals (Fig. 1, C and D), comprising two 1:1 FGF·FGFR units interacting as a dimer through both FGF·FGFR and FGFR·FGFR contacts (24Pellegrini L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Studies of ternary complex formation using gel-filtration, ultracentrifugation, and mass spectrometry suggest that this substructure exists in solution but contains just one heparin saccharide (27Harmer N.J. Ilag L.L. Mulloy B. Pellegrini L. Robinson C.V. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It is possible that the proposed symmetrical 2:2:2 structure (25Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) is in fact a 2:2:1 complex disordered around the local dyad axis in the crystals, giving apparent occupancy at both sites. In a recent study using a size exclusion chromatography approach to examine ligand-saccharide interactions, we reported that one of the key biochemical properties of heparin saccharides that correlated with induction of FGF1 mitogenesis was a capacity to dimerize the growth factor. FGF1 dimerization appeared to be a highly cooperative process because the formation of 2:1 FGF1·saccharide complexes was favored even in the presence of excess saccharide. In the present investigation we have examined the interaction of heparin saccharides of variable length and sulfation with FGF2 and equated their binding properties with bioactivity in an FGF2-FGFR1c-mediated mitogenesis assay. The results indicate some similarities with FGF1, but also reveal an underlying level of complexity in structure-activity relationships that may reflect the existence of different mechanisms of co-receptor function in native HS chains. Materials—The FGFR-transfected BaF3 cell lines, originally created by Dr. D. Ornitz (Washington University Medical School, St. Louis, MO), were obtained from Dr. J. Whitelock (University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia). Human recombinant FGF2 was purchased fromR&D Systems (Abingdon, United Kingdom). Grampian Enzymes (Orkney, UK) supplied heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7), heparinase II (no EC number assigned), and heparinase III (EC 4.2.2.8), whereas Glyko Inc. (Bicester, UK) supplied recombinant α-l-iduronate 2-O-sulfatase (I2Sase; EC 3.1.6.13) exoenzyme. The ProPac PA1 analytical column was from Dionex (Camberley, UK). The Superdex 75 HR, Superose 12 HR, and PD-10 columns were purchased from GE Healthcare. Bio-Gel P-10 resin was purchased from Bio-Rad. Invitrogen supplied cell culture media and horse serum, whereas the Cytolite™ cell proliferation assay kit was from PerkinElmer Life Science. All other reagents were from BDH-Merck LTD (Lutterworth, UK). Preparation of Heparin Oligosaccharides—Partial heparinase digests of heparin were performed as described previously (28Goger B. Halden Y. Rek A. Mosl R. Pye D. Gallagher J. Kungl A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1640-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The resultant fragments were size separated on a Bio-Gel P-10 column (1.5 × 170 cm) at 4 ml/h in 0.5 m ammonium hydrogen carbonate. A range of peaks, corresponding to heparin fragments of different length, were detected by UV absorbance at 232 nm (unsaturated bonds of heparin fragments). Fractions (1 ml) were collected and each peak was pooled separately, then freeze-dried several times to remove residual ammonium hydrogen carbonate. Removal of the non-reducing end 2-O-sulfate group from these saccharides was achieved by treatment with 40 milliunits/ml I2Sase exoenzyme overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Subfractions of the sized heparin oligosaccharide pools were prepared by resolution on an analytical ProPac PA1 (4 × 250 mm) strong anion exchange-high performance liquid chromatography (SAX-HPLC) column. The column was run at 1 ml/min in Milli-Q H2O (pH 4.0) with oligosaccharides eluted over the NaCl gradients indicated (Fig. 2). Elution was monitored at 232 nm and the identified peaks were pooled, then desalted using a PD-10 column. Each pooled sample was reapplied to the ProPac PA1 column to confirm purity.

To verify that the oligosaccharides had been fully digested down to disaccharides, the sample was applied to the Superose 12 HR SEC column using 0.25 m ammonium hydrogen carbonate at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. The disaccharides were pooled and freeze dried to remove ammonium hydrogen carbonate. Each disaccharide sample was then resolved on a ProPac PA1 column with elution monitored at 232 nm. For this a two-step linear NaCl gradient was applied at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (0–0.12 m NaCl, pH 4.0, over 90 min, followed by 0.12–1 m NaCl, pH 4.0, over 45 min) and peaks were identified by comparison with known disaccharide standards. Mitogenic Activity Screening—BaF3 lymphoblastoid cells (transfected with FGFR1c) were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) horse serum and 5% (v/v) interleukin-3 (IL-3)-conditioned medium at 37 °C. The IL-3-conditioned medium was prepared from Wehi-3b cells (mouse myelomonocytes) and filtered prior to use with the BaF3 cells. For the mitogenesis assay, BaF3 cells were serum starved for 2 days, then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C to remove residual IL-3. The cells were then seeded onto a 96-well plate at low density (2.5 × 105 cells/ml) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) horse serum, 10 ng/ml FGF2, and heparin saccharides. Porcine mucosal HS at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, with the appropriate FGF, was used as a positive control in all assays. After a 4-day incubation period, the cells were assessed for mitogenic activity using the chemiluminometric CytoLite™ assay kit on a Top Count system. Size-exclusion Chromatography (SEC) of FGF2·Saccharide Complexes—An Agilent 1100 series HPLC system was used to equilibrate a pre-packed Superdex 200 GL column (10 × 300 mm) in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). FGF2 protein (2 nmol) was added to heparin samples (1 nmol) suspended in column buffer (final volume of 250 μl) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min prior to column loading. Samples were eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and the absorbance at 214 nm (peptide bond) recorded. The column was equilibrated using protein molecular weight standards as described previously (29Robinson C.J. Harmer N.J. Goodger S.J. Blundell T.L. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42274-42282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The void and total volumes were determined using blue dextran and acetone, respectively. Preparation of Size-fractionated Heparin Oligosaccharides—SEC on a Bio-Gel P-10 column was used to separate a partial heparinase digest of heparin into a series of well resolved peaks ranging in size from 2 to 26 monosaccharide units (dp2 to dp26; degree of polymerization). The tetra-, hexa-, octa-, and decasaccharide fractions were pooled and subfractionated using SAX-HPLC. Three tetrasaccharide peaks (Fig. 2A) and five hexasaccharide peaks (Fig. 2B) were identified and pooled for use in subsequent experiments. The most anionic species (latest eluting peaks) from the heparin octasaccharide (dp8-fs) and decasaccharide (dp10-fs) profiles were also pooled (Fig. 2, C and D). Disaccharide analyses confirmed that these two oligosaccharides were fully N-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfated (Table 1).TABLE 1Disaccharide analysis of SAX-HPLC-purified heparin oligosaccharidesTotal disaccharidesUA-GlcNSUA-GlcNS(6S)UA(2S)-GlcNSUA(2S)-GlcNS(6S)%dp4-163559dp4-24456dp4-3100dp6-12132362dp6-2282943dp6-362470dp6-44456dp6-5100dp8-fs100dp10-fs100 Open table in a new tab The Effect of Heparin Oligosaccharides on FGF2·FGFR1c Activity—To clarify the shortest fragment of heparin that activated FGF2, activity screening was carried out using BaF3 cells transfected with the FGFR1c receptor (30Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). BaF3 cells are a lymphoblastoid line deficient for HS synthesis. BaF3 cells were routinely grown in the presence of IL-3, but in its absence, proliferation of FGFR-transfected cells could be induced by FGF in the presence of an exogenous source of heparin/HS (30Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Heparin disaccharides did not activate FGF2 (data not shown). The unfractionated tetra- and hexasaccharides were relatively weak inducers of FGF2 cell growth, and stimulation at 50% of the positive control value was only achieved at 2 μg/ml of saccharide (Fig. 3). For comparison we also tested the dp8-fs and dp10-fs oligosaccharides (Fig. 2, C and D). Both were very strong activators of FGF2 with FGFR1c, with dp10-fs activity even exceeding that of the HS positive control (Fig. 3). Moreover, the activation curves for these two oligosaccharides showed a sharp dose-response profile with near-maximal activity reached at just 0.1 μg/ml. Although this was not a strictly like-for-like comparison, the striking difference in mitogenic activity between the dp4/6 and dp8/10 samples prompted us to look more closely at the composition of the tetra- and hexasaccharides and to test whether individual subfractions (Fig. 2, A and B) varied in their capacity to stimulate mitogenesis. The Effect of Subfractionated Heparin Oligosaccharides on FGF2·FGFR1c Activity—Disaccharide analyses of the HPLC-prepared oligosaccharide subfractions (Fig. 2) revealed that they were all fully N-sulfated with varying degrees of 2-O- and 6-O-sulfation (Table 1). The last tetra- and hexasaccharide peaks to elute from the SAX-HPLC column were found to be relatively homogeneous fully sulfated species. In contrast, earlier eluting peaks appeared to contain more than one major species as the disaccharide ratios obtained were substoichiometric. The hexasaccharide pools dp6-1 and dp6-3 were notable as they eluted from the SAX-HPLC column at different positions (Fig. 2B), yet contained IdoUA(2S)-GlcNS and IdoUA(2S)-GlcNS(6S) in an approximately equal ratio (Table 1). These two fractions possibly contained major species that were isomers in respect to the position of 6-O-sulfate groups. The fully sulfated dp4-3 (Table 1) was able to promote proliferation much more effectively than the unfractionated tetrasaccharide sample (Figs. 3 and 4A). At 2 μg/ml this response was equivalent to the positive control. In contrast, the dp4-1 and dp4-2 fractions, which appeared to lack one 2-O-orone 6-O-sulfate, respectively (Table 1), were unable to activate FGF2 (Fig. 4A). The lower activity of the unfractionated tetrasaccharide sample, compared with purified dp4-3, can be explained by the fact that these inactive species constitute a significant proportion of the tetrasaccharides. The fully sulfated dp6-5 fraction (Table 1) was markedly more effective at stimulating cell growth than the other hexasaccharides tested (Fig. 4B). The dp6-2, dp6-3, and dp6-4 pools had an intermediate activity, whereas dp6-1, the earliest eluting SAX-HPLC peak, stimulated only a weak mitogenic response. The disaccharide analyses suggest that the differences in activity were due to the O-sulfation pattern (Table 1). The oligosaccharide peaks, dp6-1 and dp6-3, had very similar disaccharide compositions but differed in their degree of growth promoting activity. Conversely, dp6-2 and dp6-3 displayed comparable mitogenic activity, but distinct disaccharide compositions. These oligosaccharide subfractions illustrate the potential importance of sulfation pattern in the activation of the FGF2·FGFR1c signaling complex. The dp4-3 and dp6-5 fractions showed more mitogenic activity than the unfractionated tetra- and hexasaccharide samples from which they were derived. However, the activity curves for these fully sulfated fractions were notably different from those obtained with the equivalent fully sulfated octa- and decasaccharides. The dp8-fs and dp10-fs gave very sharp dose-response curves that reached a plateau at saccharide concentrations as low as 0.1 μg/ml (Fig. 3). In contrast, the fully sulfated dp4 and dp6 fractions had only a weak activity at these low levels of saccharide and their dose-response curves rose more gradually without appearing to reach a plateau (Fig. 4). This was even despite the fact that for equivalent microgram/ml quantities, the shorter heparin samples contained a greater number of oligosaccharide chains. Removal of the Terminal 2-O-Sulfate Group and Its Effect on FGF2·FGFR1c Activity—Although dp4-3 stimulates FGF2 activation of the FGFR1c receptor subtype in our assay (Fig. 4A), HS fragments of 10–12 monosaccharide units in length appear to be necessary to stimulate the same ligand-receptor pairing (17Guimond S.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This could be a consequence of their different preparation methods. Heparin fragments are produced by partial heparinase digestion that leaves a non-reducing end 2-O-sulfate group, whereas HS fragments are more commonly produced using heparinase III and so do not possess this terminal sulfation (31Desai U.R. Wang H.M. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8140-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 32Desai U.R. Wang H.M. Linhardt R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To investigate this matter, we treated our heparin oligosaccharides with I2Sase, an exoenzyme that specifically removes the non-reducing end 2-O-sulfate (33Bielicki J. Hopwood J.J. Wilson P.J. Anson D.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The I2Sase-treated samples were resolved by SAX-HPLC to confirm the enzymatic reaction had gone to completion (Fig. 2). I2Sase-treated oligosaccharide samples were compared with untreated samples for their ability to stimulate FGF2·FGFR1c mitogenesis. The tetra- and hexasaccharides were rendered inactive by I2Sase treatment (Fig. 5A), whereas dp8-fs and dp10-fs showed no significant loss of biological activity (Fig. 6, A and B). In addition, we also tested the hexasaccharide dp6-5 fraction before and after treatment with I2Sase (Fig. 5B). The enzyme effectively eliminated the mitogenic activity of dp6-5. This was despite the fact that the resultant hexasaccharide still contained a fully sulfated tetrasaccharide at its reducing end, identical in sequence to the fully sulfated heparin tetrasaccharide dp4-3 that was active in the same assay. In common with the I2Sase-treated dp6-5, untreated dp6-2 and dp6-4 also lacked a single 2-O-sulfate group (Table 1), but from internal positions (because these oligosaccharides are the products of heparinase cleavage). Both of these saccharides were modest activators of FGF2·FGFR1c mitogenesis (Fig. 4B). These findings indicate that for short saccharides the FGF signaling complex is sensitive to the sequence of 2-O-sulfation. The non-reducing end 2-O-sulfate group may facilitate receptor-receptor interactions in the symmetrical “two ends” model of ternary complex formation (25Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A.

Results demonstrate that exposure to high oxygen partial pressures increases synthesis of reactive species derived from type 2 nitric-oxide synthase and myeloperoxidase, leading to excessive S-nitrosylation of β-actin and possibly profilin. Hyperoxia causes S-nitrosylation of the four cysteine moieties closest to the carboxyl-terminal end of actin, which results in formation of short actin filaments. This alters actin polymerization, network formation, and intracellular distribution, as well as inhibits β2 integrin clustering. If neutrophils are exposed to ultraviolet light to reverse S-nitrosylation, or are incubated with N-formyl-methionyl-leucine-phenylalanine to trigger “inside-out” activation, the effects of hyperoxia are reversed.

The goal of this work was to elucidate the mechanism for inhibition of neutrophil β2 integrin adhesion molecules by hyperoxia. Neutrophil-mediated host defense, as well as tissue injury in situations such as ischemia-reperfusion, involves neutrophil activation and recruitment to a vascular bed. These functions require integrin-mediated cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion. Neutrophils express β1, β2, and β3 integrins, but the β2 family (known as CD18 integrins) is predominantly expressed, and β2 integrins play a central role in regulating neutrophil activation and endothelial adhesion (1Brown E.

Previous studies have shown that HBO2 does not reduce neutrophil viability or cause immunocompromise, and functions such as degranulation and oxidative burst in response to chemoattractants appear to be intact (2Thom S.R.

Physiol. 1997; 272: C770-C777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Integrins are normally poorly adhesive, and their activation involves modifications in the conformation of the extracellular components to increase the affinity for binding and a coordinated grouping of integrins in the plane of the membrane to increase their avidity. Conformational (or affinity) changes and clustering (or avidity) represent two distinct events that appear to operate in a complementary manner to control cell adhesion (20Cambi A. Joosten B. Koopman M. Lange F.D. Beeren I. Torensma R. Fransen J. Garcia-Parajo M. Leeuwen F.V. Figdor C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4270-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton is involved with both of these events. Integrins can be activated by intracellular mechanisms (inside-out path) and by extracellular contacts (outside-in path), thus making the integrin-actin complex a communication conduit. Actin binding via an assortment of linking proteins provides a mechanical platform that brings integrins and activable enzymes together (22Calderwood D. Shattil S. Ginsberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 23Blystone S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). There are over 50 proteins involved with connecting integrins and the actin cytoskeleton (24Zamir E. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3583-3590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The goal of this investigation was to elucidate the mechanism for the inhibitory effect of HBO2 on neutrophil β2 integrin function. We hypothesized that the HBO2 mechanism was related to production of reactive species. Production of superoxide radical ( (O2·)) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is increased by hyperoxia, and HBO2 can also increase nitric oxide (.NO) production by stimulating isoforms of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) (25Jamieson D. Chance B. Cadenas E. Boveris A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 703-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 26Thom S.R. Bhopale V. Fisher D. Manevich Y. Huang P.L. Buerk D.G. J.

Physiol. 2003; 284: H1230-H1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this study we show that neutrophil NOS and myeloperoxidase (MPO) are required for β2 integrin inhibition and that cytoskeletal protein S-nitrosylation is a result. Filamentous actin (F-actin) formation, reduced CD18 clustering, and a subtle perturbation in the association between profilin and cytoskeletal actin occur in response to hyperoxia. Incubation with the chemotactic peptide, N-formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fMLP), which modulates actin protein binding by changing cellular phosphoinositides via the so-called inside-out path, can override the HBO2 effect (28Sha'afi R. Molski T. Prog. Allergy. 1988; 42: 1-64PubMed Google Scholar, 29Zaffran Y. Lepidi H. Bongrand P. Mege J.-L. Capo C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 675-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ultraviolet light (UV) photo-reversal of protein S-nitrosylation also restores β2 integrin function. Thus, HBO2 inhibits neutrophil β2 integrin activation by generating reactive nitrogen species that perturb the cytoskeleton. Materials—Unless otherwise noted, chemicals were purchased from Sigma. N-(6-(Biotinamido)hexyl)-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide (biotin-HPDP) and streptavidin-Sepharose were purchased from Pierce. Ultrafree-MC filters, polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-FL, and ZipTipC18P10 were from Millipore Corp. Antibodies were purchased from the following vendors: anti-biotin, anti-talin, and anti-actin from Sigma; anti-cGMP protein kinase, anti-HSP20, anti-phospho-HSP20, anti-cofilin, anti-profilin, anti-α-actinin, and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to APC from BD Biosciences; anti-CD66, APC-conjugated and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-Ly-6G from Cell Sciences (Canton, MA); anti-mouse CD18 and CD18-RPE conjugate from eBiosciences (San Diego, CA); anti-human Fc receptor mouse IgG from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA); intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)/human IgG chimera fromR&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); and anti-ArpC1A, anti-ArpC3, anti-mDia1(mammalian Diaphanous-related formin-1), and anti-SPIRE1 from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). Animals—Wild type mice (Mus musculus) and MPO knock-out mice were purchased (The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME), fed a standard rodent diet and water ad libitum, and housed in the animal facility of the University of Pennsylvania. A colony of MPO knock-out mice was maintained from breeding pairs purchased from The Jackson Laboratories. Male Wistar rats were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indian-apolis, IN). Mice and rats were exposed to O2 at 1-3 ATA for 45 min following our published protocol (30Thom S.R. Bhopale V.M. Velazquez O.C. Goldstein L.J. Thom L.H. Buerk D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1378-H1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). After anesthesia (intraperitoneal administration of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg)), skin was prepared by swabbing with Betadine, and the blood was collected into heparinized syringes following aortic puncture. Isolation of Neutrophils—Neutrophils were isolated from heparinized blood using a protocol modified from Fekete et al. (31Fekete Z. Hauser C.J. Adams Jr., J.M. Adams Jr., C.A. Forsythe R.M. Haskó G. Xu D.Z. Livingston D.H. Deitch E.A. Shock. 2001; 16: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Blood was made to a volume of 2.5 ml with cell buffer (PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 5.5 mm glucose) that was placed over 5 ml of Robbins PMN Prep plus 0.4 ml of 1.5% NaCl in a 15-ml silicone-coated glass tube and centrifuged at 400 × g for 30 min. The platelet-rich plasma was discarded; the mononuclear cell layer was obtained on occasion, and the underlying neutrophil layer was always collected. The neutrophils and at times the monocytes were placed in silicone-coated glass tubes and combined with an equal volume of 0.45% NaCl for 5 min. The cells were then washed by adding cell buffer at a 3:1 ratio and centrifuging at 200 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and cell pellets were resuspended in NH4Cl/Tris Lysis Buffer for 10 min. The solutions were centrifuged at 450 × g for 10 min, and the cells were resuspended in cell buffer at a concentration of 5 × 106/ml. Final isolations were greater than 93% pure with greater than 98% live cells as shown by trypan blue exclusion. Fibrinogen-coated Plate Adherence—Fibrinogen-coated plates were prepared by washing 15-mm Petri plates with H2SO4 and rinsing three times with distilled water. Fibrinogen (500 μl of solution containing 30 μg/ml PBS) was added to each plate. After a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, the plates were rinsed twice with PBS and were ready for use. Isolated neutrophils exposed to air or hyperoxia ex vivo, or simply taken from animals exposed to air or HBO2, were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with calcein AM (5 μg/ml), washed twice with cell buffer, and then resuspended to a count of 5 × 105/100 μl. Aliquots of 100 μl were incubated on plates either alone, with anti-CD18 antibody (4 μg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature, with 100 nm fMLP for 1 min, or with anti-CD18 antibody for 10 min followed by 100 nm fMLP for 1 min. After incubation, 100 μl of buffer was removed from the plates, and the plates were washed twice with 4 ml of PBS to remove nonadherent cells. Fluorescence on the plates was measured (480 nm excitation/520 nm emission) in a plate reader. Adhesion was always assessed in triplicate and calculated as fluorescence in washed wells versus fluorescence in wells where cells were added but not washed to remove nonadherent cells. In each experiment specificity for β2 integrin adherence was checked by inclusion of a cell set incubated with anti-CD18 antibody, which reduced adherence to 0-2%. In a sub-set of experiments, prior to placement on plates, neutrophils were exposed for 5 min to UV light from a 200-watt mercury vapor lamp kept at sufficient distance so that temperature was not altered. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was performed with a 4-color, dual laser analog FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest acquisition software, or 18-color LSRII (BD Biosciences) using FACsDiva digital acquisition electronics and software (BD Biosciences) by standard protocol. Fluorophore (fluorescein isothiocyanate, RPE, or APC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and unstained cells served as negative controls. Compensation for 4-color staining samples was concentration-dependent and was determined empirically. Compensation for multicolor assays was performed automatically by FACSDiva software on the LSRII. Identification and enumeration of ICAM beads, β-integrins, and neutrophils were performed using CellQuest™ acquisition/analysis software (BD Biosciences), including three-dimensional histograms for Quantum Plex™ SP microbeads quantification and the FlowJo Program (Tree-Star Inc., Ashland, OR). Surface Expression of β2 Integrins—After mice were exposed to HBO2, neutrophils were obtained and incubated with 4 μl of anti-CD18 RPE-conjugated antibody and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The samples were divided into 2 aliquots, and 100 nm fMLP was added to 1 aliquot and an equal volume of buffer was added to the other. After incubation for 1 min at room temperature, 1.5 ml of cold HBSS buffer was added to all of the tubes, and samples were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min, washed twice with 1 ml of cold HBSS, then resuspended in HBSS, and assayed in the flow cytometer. Forward scatter and side scatter was used to isolate neutrophil populations, and the mean linear fluorescence was examined for the different samples. In some trials, assurance pertaining to accurate neutrophil gating location was verified by co-labeling cells with anti-CD66 or anti-Ly-6G (32Ruchaud-Sparagano M. Stocks S. Turley H. Dransfield I. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 98: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Zhou J. Stohlman S. Hinton B. Marten N. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These extra manipulations did not modify β2 integrin expression. Oxidative Burst—After isolation, neutrophils were incubated with 5 μm DCF-diacetate at 37 °C for 15 min. Samples were divided into 2 aliquots, and 100 nm fMLP was added to one and HBSS buffer was added to the other followed by incubation for 1 min at room temperature. Then 1.5 ml of cold HBSS buffer was added to all of the tubes; samples were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min, washed twice with 1 ml of cold HBSS, and then resuspended in HBSS for flow cytometry analysis of DCF fluorescence of neutrophils that were identified by forward and side laser light scatter and anti-Ly-6G staining. Fluorescent Bead Adhesion Assay—ICAM-coated beads were prepared by incubating anti-mouse IgG-linked Quantum Plex™ SP beads (Bangs Laboratories, Fishers, IN; 50 μl, ∼1 × 105 red-stained 4.4 μm beads that fluoresce in FL3 channel) with 50 μl of anti-human Fc receptor mouse IgG and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Suspensions were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, washed twice, and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS. Then 25 μg of mouse ICAM-1/human Fc chimera was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by 20 μl of mouse serum to block residual Fc receptors, and incubated for an additional 30 min. The bead complex was washed three times with PBS, resuspended in 200 μl of PBS, and stored at 4 °C until use. Isolated neutrophils from control or HBO2-exposed mice were counted and incubated with beads at a ratio of ∼20 beads/cell in the absence or presence of 100 nm fMLP. Adhesion was determined by flow cytometry. Microelectrode Assay—Production of .NO by cells exposed to various partial pressures of O2 was carried out using published procedures (26Thom S.R. Bhopale V. Fisher D. Manevich Y. Huang P.L. Buerk D.G. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 51: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 34Thom S.R. Xu Y.A. Ischiropoulos H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In brief, neutrophils were suspended in cell buffer at a concentration of 2.5 × 106/ml and placed in a hyperbaric chamber with pass-through connections where a polarographic .NO meter (ISO-NOP200, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL.) had been mounted and calibrated using authentic .NO. Cells were continuously stirred while exposed to air, and the current was recorded. While maintaining the cells and apparatus under the same operating conditions, the chamber was flushed with pure O2 and the signal re-recorded. The chamber was then slowly pressurized to 2.0 and then 3.0 ATA. Each change in pressure was carried out slowly so that ambient temperature changed less than 2 °C, and the current was recorded only after buffer temperature had returned to room temperature (21 °C). Using the same cell suspension for each partial pressure of O2, the difference in responses was compared. The study was then repeated, but cells were suspended in buffer containing 1 mm NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME). The difference in signals ±1 mml-NAME was taken as .NO production by the cells. Cell Extract Preparation and Biotin-switch Assay—Neutrophils were isolated from control and HBO2-exposed mice and resuspended in 2 ml of HEN buffer (250 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm neocuproine), sonicated on ice for 30 s, and then passed through a 28-gauge needle five times. Lysates were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was recovered and made to 0.4% CHAPS using a 10% stock solution. The biotin-switch assay was carried out essentially as described by Jaffrey et al. (35Jaffrey S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C. Tempst P. Snyder S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). After adding 4 volumes of blocking buffer (HEN buffer + 2.5% SDS, 20 mm methyl methanethiosulfonate), samples were incubated at 50 °C for 20 min with frequent vortexing. Ten volumes of -20 °C acetone was added and incubated at -20 °C for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min and resuspension in 0.1 ml of HENS buffer + 1% SDS/mg protein. Biotinylation was accomplished by adding a 1:3 volume of labeling solution (4 mm biotin-HPDP dissolved in dimethylformamide) and a 1:50 volume of 50 mm ascorbate followed by incubation for 1 h at 25 °C. In selected trials, biotin-switch analysis was performed on cell lysates treated with HPDP-biotin or with ascorbate (but not both) or with 1 mm HgCl2 for 10 min at room temperature (which cleaves S-NO bonds). For initial identification of nitrosylated proteins, 2 volumes of -20 °C acetone were added to lysate samples and incubated at -20 °C for 20 min, and samples were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were discarded and pellets resuspended in SDS buffer for Western blots that were probed with anti-biotin following published methods (36Thom S.R. Bhopale V.M. Fisher D. Zhang J. Gimotty P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13660-13665Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Band densities were quantified using an Odyssey Infrared Imager (Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE). When samples were used for protein digestion followed by affinity peptide capture, cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of incubation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.4% Triton X-100), 1:20 endoproteinase GluC (V8), and incubated at room temperature for 16 h in the dark. It should be noted that early trials performed using 1:100 diethylpyrocarbonate-treated trypsin did not recover HPDP-modified peptides. After the desired protease digestion, samples were made to 0.5 mm PMSF and passed through Ultra-free-MC 10-kDa cutoff filters there were previously rinsed with methanol and washed with water. The filtrate was recovered and incubated with 50 μl of dry, washed streptavidin-Sepharose beads for 30 min. After centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min, beads were washed five times in 10 volumes of 1 m ammonium carbonate, followed by five washes with 10 volumes of deionized water. Peptides were eluted by incubating beads with buffer at pH 3.8 for 30 min. After centrifuging beads at 5,000 × g for 4 min, the supernatant was removed, and peptide fragments were eluted with 70% formic acid and evaporated to ∼5 μl in vacuo, followed by resuspension in 20 μl of PBS. Protein and Peptide Analysis—Mass spectrometry (MS) and protein sequencing were done by the Proteomics Core Facility of the Genomics Institute and the Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania. Protein bands identified as containing biotin on Western blots were cut from nitrocellulose paper, trypsin-digested, and analyzed with a nanoliquid chromatography/nanospray/LTQ mass spectrometer following our published methods (36Thom S.R. Bhopale V.M. Fisher D. Zhang J. Gimotty P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13660-13665Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The raw data files were searched using Mascot against the NCBI data base with a cutoff protein score of 70. For analyzing the peptides obtained following affinity purification with streptavidin-Sepharose beads, peptides were dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1% formic acid + 1% acetonitrile and 3 μl injected and separated with a C18 column at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. The separated peptides were eluted and sprayed on line into the LTQ (Thermo Electron) at 22 kV. The raw data from MS/MS spectra were acquired with Xcalibur and searched with Sequest. Only peptide assignments with a differential 428-atomic mass unit addition to cysteine because of HPDP-biotin in the y- or b-ion series were considered. The cross-correlation (xC) score cutoff was 1.5 for single charged, 2.0 for double charged, and 2.5 for triple charged peptides. Filamentous Actin and CD18 Imaging—Neutrophils isolated from control and HBO2-exposed mice were placed on glass slides that had been coated with fibrinogen. Poly-l-lysine-coated slides were incubated with a solution of fibrinogen (200 μg/ml) for 3 h at 37 °C and then cooled to room temperature prior to use. An 80-μl cell suspension was incubated on slides for 10 min and then fixed by addition of 80 μl of cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, followed by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. Autofluorescence was quenched by incubation in ice-cold PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 50 mm NH4Cl for 15 min and then rinsed with PBS. Cells were then permeabilized by adding 2 mm palmitoyl l-α-phosphatidylcholine along with 1 unit/ml of Alexa Fluor 488 phallacidin (Molecular Probes) and 1:1000 mouse anti-CD18-RPE. Following incubation in the dark for 30 min at 37 °C, slides were washed five times with cold HBSS, and coverslipped. Examinations were carried out with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 attached to a Nikon TE 300 inverted stage confocal microscope that was operated with a red diode laser at 638 nm, and krypton lasers at 488 and 543 nm. Quantification of the fluorescence signals was performed using MetaMorph Image Analysis software (MDS, Inc., Toronto, Canada). Immunoprecipitation of Protein Complexes after in Situ Cross-linking—Cell suspensions from control or HBO2-exposed mice were placed on fibrinogen-coated plates, and after 10-min incubations, adherent cells were subjected to protein cross-linking essentially as described by Huttelmaier et al. (37Huttelmaier S. Mayboroda O. Harbeck B. Jarchau T. Jockusch B. Rudiger M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) using dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DTSP) (Pierce). DTSP cross-links proteins over a span of ∼12 Å (37Huttelmaier S. Mayboroda O. Harbeck B. Jarchau T. Jockusch B. Rudiger M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). After 300 μl of PBS containing 0.5 mm DTSP was added to the adherent cells, they were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were washed twice with PBS and then with PBS + 0.2 m glycine to quench cross-linking. After two additional washes, 0.5 ml of RIPA buffer was added (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm glycine, 2.5 mm sodium azide, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were scraped off the plates with a rubber policeman and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. A pre-cleared supernatant volume containing 250 μg of protein was incubated with 5 μg of anti-actin antibodies on a shaker overnight at 4 °C, and then 30 μl of 20% (w/v) protein G-Sepharose (pre-blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin) was added and incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Samples were washed twice in RIPA buffer, pelleted, suspended in 20 μl of heated SDS buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 20% β-mercaptoethanol), and incubated at 95 °C for 15-20 min. Proteins were subjected to electrophoresis in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (36Thom S.R. Bhopale V.M. Fisher D. Zhang J. Gimotty P.

https://openalex.org/W2038469447,"The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 activates several hundred genes within the same cell. This occurs in part by activation of the MKK7-JNK-c-Jun signaling pathway whose precise role in the regulation of individual inflammatory genes is still incompletely understood. To identify the genes that are under specific control of activated JNK, we used a JNK-MKK7 fusion protein. Genome-wide microarray analysis revealed EGR-1 as the transcript that was most strongly induced by JNK-MKK7. IL-1-stimulated EGR-1 mRNA and protein expression were impaired in cells lacking JNK or c-Jun. Transcriptional activation of the EGR-1 promoter by JNK-MKK7 or by IL-1 required a single upstream AP-1 site and three distal serum-response elements (SRE). Reconstitution experiments in c-Jun-deficient cells revealed that c-Jun is required for EGR-1 transcription through both the AP-1 site and the distal SREs. By chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we found IL-1-inducible recruitment of c-Jun to the AP-1 site and to the region containing the three distal SREs. These experiments suggest that c-Jun plays a dual role in EGR-1 transcription. It directly binds to the AP-1 element, and at the same time it is essential for promoter activation through the three distal SREs by an indirect unknown mechanism. As predicted by TRANSFAC analysis and verified by ChIP experiments, IL-1-induced EGR-1 protein binds to the promoter regions of inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, IL-8, and CCL2. Furthermore, short interfering RNA-mediated suppression of EGR-1 partially suppresses IL-1-inducible transcription of IL-8, IL-6, and CCL2. In summary, we provide novel evidence for a complex c-Jun-mediated mechanism that is essential for inducible EGR-1 expression. We identify this pathway as a previously unrecognized part of a multistep gene regulatory network that controls cytokine and chemokine expression via the IL-1-MKK7-JNK-c-Jun-EGR-1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2108479235,"All aspartic proteases, including retroviral proteases, share the triplet DTG critical for the active site geometry and catalytic function. These residues interact closely in the active, dimeric structure of HIV-1 protease (PR). We have systematically assessed the effect of the D25N mutation on the structure and stability of the mature PR monomer and dimer. The D25N mutation (PRD25N) increases the equilibrium dimer dissociation constant by a factor >100-fold (1.3 ± 0.09 μm) relative to PR. In the absence of inhibitor, NMR studies reveal clear structural differences between PR and PRD25N in the relatively mobile P1 loop (residues 79-83) and flap regions, and differential scanning calorimetric analyses show that the mutation lowers the stabilities of both the monomer and dimer folds by 5 and 7.3 °C, respectively. Only minimal differences are observed in high resolution crystal structures of PRD25N complexed to darunavir (DRV), a potent clinical inhibitor, or a non-hydrolyzable substrate analogue, Ac-Thr-Ile-Nle-r-Nle-Gln-Arg-NH2 (RPB), as compared with PR·DRV and PR·RPB complexes. Although complexation with RPB stabilizes both dimers, the effect on their Tm is smaller for PRD25N (6.2 °C) than for PR (8.7 °C). The Tm of PRD25N·DRV increases by only 3 °C relative to free PRD25N, as compared with a 22 °C increase for PR·DRV, and the mutation increases the ligand dissociation constant of PRD25N·DRV by a factor of ∼106 relative to PR·DRV. These results suggest that interactions mediated by the catalytic Asp residues make a major contribution to the tight binding of DRV to PR.

Gag-Pol comprises the matrix, capsid, P2, nucleocapsid, transframe, protease (PR), reverse transcriptase, and integrase domains (1Oroszlan S. Luftig R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 153-185PubMed Google Scholar). The protease mediates its own release and the processing of the viral polyproteins, Gag and Gag-Pol, into the necessary structural and functional proteins (1Oroszlan S. Luftig R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 153-185PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kohl N.E. Emini E.A. Schleif W.A. Davis L.J. Heimbach J.C. Dixon R.A. Scolnick E.M. Sigal I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because of this vital role, the mature protease dimer has proven to be a successful target for the development of antiviral agents. Structure-based design of drugs targeted against the mature protease has aided in the development of potent inhibitors that bind specifically to the active site (8Erickson J.W. Burt S.K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 545-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 9Weber I.T. Kovalevsky A.Y. Harrison R.W. Frontiers Drug Design Discov. 2007; 3: 45-62Google Scholar). Although several of these inhibitors are in clinical use and have curtailed the progression of the disease, the effectiveness of long term treatment has been limited due to naturally selected protease variants exhibiting lower affinity to the drugs than the wild-type enzyme, and this has been a challenge for the past decade (10Louis J.M. Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Weber I.T. Adv. Pharmacol. 2007; 55: 261-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In recent years, a major emphasis in protease research has been to improve inhibitor design and treatment regimens, which include the highly active retroviral therapy, to overcome the problem of drug resistance and curb progress of the disease (11Rodriguez-Barrios F. Gago F. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 991-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Temesgen Z. Warnke D. Kasten M.J. Expert. Opin. Pharmacother. 2006; 7: 1541-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The HIV-1 protease is composed of 99 amino acids and is a member of the family of aspartic acid proteases (1Oroszlan S. Luftig R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 153-185PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pearl L.H. Taylor W.R. Nature. 1987; 329: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Unlike the cellular aspartic proteases that are active as monomers, catalytic activity of retroviral proteases, including HIV-1 protease, requires dimer formation (14Wlodawer A. Erickson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 543-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The active site is formed along the dimer interface, and each subunit contributes one of the two catalytic aspartic acid residues (1Oroszlan S. Luftig R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 153-185PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wlodawer A. Erickson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 543-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). These residues are expected to be in opposite states of protonation for activity, and the water molecule involved in the hydrolysis of the peptide bond is proposed to be hydrogen bonded to the aspartyl residues (15Rodriguez E.J. Angeles T.S. Meek T.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12380-12385Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Wlodawer A. Miller M. Jaskolski M. Sathyanarayana B.K. Baldwin E. Weber I.T. Selk L.M. Clawson L. Schneider J. Kent S.B. Science. 1989; 245: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of the peptide bond mediated by the protease involves general base/general acid catalysis. The importance of the Asp-25 residue for protease function was confirmed in studies showing that it is required for catalytic activity and viral infectivity (2Kohl N.E. Emini E.A. Schleif W.A. Davis L.J. Heimbach J.C. Dixon R.A. Scolnick E.M. Sigal I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4686-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed that coexpression of the wild-type proviral DNA with increasing amounts of the mutant proviral DNA bearing the D25N mutation results in a concomitant decrease in the proteolytic activity monitored by in vivo viral polyprotein processing (17Babe L.M. Rose J. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10069-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This suggested that the protease domain bearing the D25N mutation is capable of adopting a native-like fold to sequester the wild-type protease via heterodimer formation. Because the protease bearing this mutation is completely devoid of catalytic activity, it is a useful tool for studies of the protease under conditions where the active protease tends to undergo rapid autoproteolysis (self-degradation). Additionally, the inactivating mutation D25N makes it possible to investigate the binding of substrates to the protease without the interference of the accompanying proteolytic cleavage reaction. Thus, the mature protease and its precursor bearing the D25N mutation have been effectively used in such studies with substrates corresponding to the natural cleavage sites in the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins by x-ray crystallography and NMR (10Louis J.M. Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Weber I.T. Adv. Pharmacol. 2007; 55: 261-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Prabu-Jeyabalan M. Nalivaika E. Schiffer C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1207-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The steps in the maturation of the Gag-Pol precursor and the mechanism of the autocatalytic maturation of the protease have been studied extensively (3Louis J.M. Weber I.T. Tozser J. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 49: 111-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Louis J.M. Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Weber I.T. Adv. Pharmacol. 2007; 55: 261-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Upon its intramolecular maturation at its N terminus, the protease forms a stable dimer concomitant with the formation of the terminal β-sheet structure and a very low equilibrium dimer dissociation constant (Kd < 10 nm) (10Louis J.M. Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Weber I.T. Adv. Pharmacol. 2007; 55: 261-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is predicted that disrupting the terminal β-sheet arrangement of the mature protease, which contributes to ∼50% of the total dimer interface contacts, or preventing dimer formation prior to its maturation may provide an alternative avenue for inhibitor design (10Louis J.M. Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Weber I.T. Adv. Pharmacol. 2007; 55: 261-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Rodriguez-Barrios F. Gago F. Curr. Top. Med.

Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10492-10496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This presumably non-competitive mode of inhibition might show a synergistic effect to the conventional active site targeted compounds with the advantage of reducing the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Several groups have reported the development of dimerization inhibitors of the mature protease; however, none of these kinds of potential lead compounds have been characterized further for possible clinical use (19Sluis-Cremer N. Tachedjian G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5103-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recent complementary NMR structural and biophysical studies of the mature protease and its precursor have aimed to elucidate the role of conserved regions required for a native-like fold, dimer formation, and precursor maturation. Several subtle mutations have been identified that increase the Kd by ∼2 to >5 orders of magnitude, thus also enabling the solution structure determination of the protease monomer by NMR (10Louis J.M. Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Weber I.T. Adv. Pharmacol. 2007; 55: 261-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is anticipated that insights derived from such studies will aid in the discovery and rational design of novel inhibitors of dimerization. In our exploration of sites that are critical for dimer formation, we had observed that a D25N mutation also significantly increases the Kd (21Katoh E. Louis J.M. Yamazaki T. Gronenborn A.M. Torchia D.A. Ishima R. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1376-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the present study we report the characterization of the effects of this mutation on the dimer stability, inhibitor/substrate binding, and the molecular structure and dynamics of the protease by a multifaceted approach comprising NMR, calorimetry, and crystallography. Vector Construction and Protein Preparation—The pseudo wild type (PR) (22Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and the active site mutant (PRD25N) mature protease constructs were expressed using pET11a vector and Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) host, purified from inclusion bodies and folded from a denatured state as described (22Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17190-17199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of PRT26A, PRD25N/T26A, and SFNFPRD25N constructs has been described previously (24Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Lynch S.M. Gronenborn A.M. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43311-43319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A new construct, PR5-95/D25N, was generated using the PR5-95 DNA template (23Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17190-17199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), appropriate forward and reverse primers, and the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). The newly introduced mutation was verified both by DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry. To maintain consistency in the analysis, all constructs bear five mutations, Q7K, L33I and L63I (which restrict the autoproteolysis (self-degradation) of active proteases), and C67A and C97A, to prevent cysteine thiol oxidation (22Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). They differ only in their specified mutations (shown in subscripts). Proteins for NMR studies were obtained by growing the cells in minimal media containing [15N]ammonium chloride with or without [13C]glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. Inhibitors and Substrate—The non-hydrolyzable substrate analog inhibitor RPB, Ac-Thr-Ile-Nle-r-Nle-Gln-Arg-NH2, in which r (reduced peptide bond) represents a methylene group that replaces the peptide carbonyl, was obtained from Bachem Bioscience Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). Darunavir (DRV) was a generous gift of Dr. Arun Ghosh, Purdue University, and was subsequently obtained from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) AIDS research and reference reagent program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: Reagent 11447 from Tibotec Pharmaceuticals. Substrate IV, Lys-Ala-Arg-Val-Nle-(4-nitrophenylalanine)-Glu-Ala-Nle-NH2, was purchased from California Peptide Research (Napa, CA). NMR Experiments—All NMR data were recorded on DMX500 spectrometers with or without a cryoprobe (Bruker Instruments, Billerica, MA) at 20 °C. 1H-15N correlation spectra of PRD25N were acquired using 15 N-labeled protein at 0.5 mm in 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 5.8 and 25 μm in 50 mm acetate buffer at pH 5.0. Backbone chemical shifts were assigned based on HNCA type experiments using a 0.5 mm 15N,13C-labeled protein at pH 5.8, similar to those used to assign chemical shifts of PR previously (25Ishima R. Louis J.M. Torchia D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Experiments to determine transverse relaxation time, T2, and 15N-{1H} NOE values were carried out using 0.5 mm 15N-labeled protein at pH 5.8 as described previously (26Freedberg D.I. Ishima R. Jacob J. Wang Y.X. Kustanovich I. Louis J.M. Torchia D.A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Measurements were performed using a high precision VP-ITC titration calorimetric system (MicroCal Inc.) at 28 °C. PR and PRD25N were prepared according to the quench protocol of protein folding (23Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17190-17199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to a final concentration of 6.9 μm and 14.7 μm, respectively, by mixing 1 volume of protein in 30-50 mm formic acid with 2.3-2.5 volumes of 5 mm sodium acetate, pH 6, and then with 3.3-4 volumes of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5 (buffer mix). The RPB inhibitor was dissolved in the same buffer mix to a final concentration of 300 μm. For titration of PRD25N with DRV, the buffered PRD25N solution contained a final protein concentration of 11 μm. The DRV solution was prepared at a final concentration of 266 μm and contained a final concentration of 0.5% Me2SO derived from the DRV stock solution. Me2SO was added to the enzyme solution to give the same 0.5% concentration, to eliminate possible thermal effects on dilution of the organic solvent from the titrant. Analyses of the data were performed using Origin software provided with the instrument. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Measurements were performed using a VP-DSC microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc.). Samples were prepared by the quench protocol (23Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17190-17199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as above to give a final protein concentration of 26-33 μm as monomer and a buffer concentration of 50 mm sodium acetate at pH 4.8. Thermal denaturation scans were begun at a temperature of 20 or 25 °C and run at a rate of 90 °C/h, except for SFNFPRD25N (60 °C/h). The final temperature ranged from 85 to 100 °C depending on the observed Tm. Raw data from representative DSC scans of each of the protease constructs are given in supporting information (supplemental Fig. S1). Reversibility as determined by assaying PR (22Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) before and after scanning showed an ∼90% loss of activity after one scan. In the experiments with RPB and DRV inhibitors, the inhibitor was present at a final concentration of 30 μm (approximately twice the concentration of the dimeric proteins). For the DSC of PRD25N with substrate IV, the final substrate concentration was 360 μm. Reference (buffer) scans were subtracted from the observed traces, and the data were normalized for protein (monomer or dimer) concentration. Linear baseline segments were selected in regions of the trace before and after the transition peak, and the Origin software of the instrument was then used to generate and subtract a “progress baseline” between them that reflects the fraction of the total reaction completed at each temperature point (as described in the MicroCal data analysis manual). The apparent Tm was determined from the resultant peak maximum. Because of the lack of reversibility, rigorous thermodynamic analysis was not possible, and no attempt was made to determine ΔCp or ΔH for the transitions. Crystallographic Analysis—Crystals were grown at 20-25 °C by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop method. Mutant PRD25N was co-crystallized with the potent clinical inhibitor, DRV, in a protein to inhibitor molar ratio of 1:2. The reservoir contained 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and 30% sodium chloride as precipitant. PRD25N was co-crystallized with RPB in a molar ratio of 1:20 in the reservoir containing 0.1 m citrate/0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 5.4, 10% sodium chloride as precipitant, and 5-10% Me2SO. The protein (1.8-3.5 mg/ml) was preincubated on ice. The crystallization drops had a 1:1 ratio by volume of reservoir solution and protein. The crystals grew in 1-7 days and were frozen in liquid nitrogen with a cryoprotectant of 20-30% glycerol. X-ray diffraction data for both complexes were collected on the SER-CAT beamline of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Data were processed using HKL2000 (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38436) Google Scholar). The structures were solved by molecular replacement using AmoRe (28Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar), refined using SHELX (29Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar) and refitted using O (30Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). Alternate conformations were modeled for residues when obvious in the electron density maps. The solvent was modeled with over 100 water molecules, and ions present in the crystallization solutions, as described previously (31Tie Y. Boross P.I. Wang Y.F. Gaddis L. Hussain A.K. Leshchenko S. Ghosh A.K. Louis J.M. Harrison R.W. Weber I.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Anisotropic B factors were refined for all the structures. Hydrogen atom positions were included in the last stage of refinement using all data once all other parameters, including disorder, had been modeled. The structures have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank with accession code 3BVB for PRD25N·DRV and 3BVA for PRD25N·RPB. Monomer-Dimer Equilibria—Because PRD25N is not catalytically active, it was not possible to measure its Kd by analysis of the dependence of enzymatic activity on protein concentration as in the case of PR (22Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We have previously observed differences in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of protease constructs that exist predominantly as dimers or as monomers and assigned the signals characteristic of each species (32Ishima R. Ghirlando R. Tozser J. Gronenborn A.M. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49110-49116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Hence this method was used to characterize the monomer-dimer equilibrium of PRD25N. At ∼0.5 mm concentration in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.8, 20 °C, we observed a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum for PRD25N (Fig. 1A) in the absence of bound inhibitor that is similar to that observed for PR (32Ishima R. Ghirlando R. Tozser J. Gronenborn A.M. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49110-49116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), indicating that it is essentially dimeric at this concentration. We have recently described a simple protocol (see quench protocol in Ref. 23Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17190-17199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) for preparing folded dimers and monomeric mutants of the protease at low concentrations of ∼20 μm, suitable for NMR and other biophysical studies. Under these conditions (an ∼20-fold lower protein concentration than in Fig. 1A), signals corresponding to a minor fraction become more evident in the PRD25N spectrum (Fig. 1B). Although the signals of the minor component were not assigned due to overlap with the dimer signals, it is apparent from comparing the previously assigned chemical shifts of PRR87K and PR1-95 monomers (24Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Lynch S.M. Gronenborn A.M. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43311-43319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Ishima R. Ghirlando R. Tozser J.

On the basis of the signal intensities of the characteristic monomer peaks and the corresponding dimer peaks, the Kd of the PRD25N dimer was determined to be 1.3 ± 0.09 μm, at pH 5.0. These values are similar to those previously determined qualitatively for PRD25N by NMR (21Katoh E. Louis J.M. Yamazaki T. Gronenborn A.M. Torchia D.A. Ishima R.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1702-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the value of ∼0.01 μm previously estimated for PR from kinetic data (22Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to suppression of catalytic activity, the D25N mutation significantly affects the monomer-dimer equilibrium of the mature protease. Effects on Thermal Stability—In earlier studies we had shown that the quench protocol of preparing folded protease permitted NMR and fluorescence measurements under similar conditions. Under the conditions described (23Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17190-17199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), folded protease samples can be prepared easily prior to each experiment from the same stock solutions maintained in an unfolded state, usually in 30-50 mm formic acid. This has enabled the facile preparation and comparison of the thermal stabilities of PR, PRD25N, and several related constructs (supporting information, supplemental Table S1). Consistent with the difference in dimer stability, the D25N mutation results in a significant (7.3 °C) decrease in the Tm determined from the peak maxima of the transitions for unfolding/dimer dissociation relative to PR as measured by DSC at pH 4.8 (Fig. 2, A and B). Previous observations that the midpoints of urea denaturation curves for PR (22Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and PRD25N (23Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17190-17199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) both occur at ∼2 m urea had indicated no significant difference between PRD25N and PR. The present observations may result from mechanistic differences between the thermal and urea denaturation processes of the protease. Constructs that lack the terminal residues 1-4 and 96-99 critical for the dimer interface exist as folded monomers in solution (23Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17190-17199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of the D25N mutation on monomer stability by comparing the thermal stabilities of PR5-95 and PR5-95/D25N. The Tm for PR5-95/D25N is 5 °C lower than for PR5-95 (Fig. 2C). These observations indicate that Asp-25 plays a significant role in stabilizing the monomer and dimer folds and is consistent with the greater sensitivity to urea denaturation of PRD25N/T26A (midpoint of the denaturation curve at ∼1.8 m urea) relative to PRT26A (midpoint at ∼2.5 m urea), both of which are folded monomers (23Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17190-17199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The native transframe region (TFR) flanking the N terminus of the protease comprises two domains, the conserved transframe octapeptide followed by the 48 amino acid p6pol, both separated by a protease cleavage site (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 23Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17190-17199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It appears that the monomer-dimer equilibrium of the protease is modulated by the N-terminally flanking TFR, such that prior to the cleavage at the p6pol/PR junction, the protease domain is mainly monomeric (Kd > 0.5 mm), exhibiting a fold t"

During Arg hydroxylation, H4B acts as a one-electron donor and is then presumed to redox cycle (i.e. be reduced back to H4B) within NOS before further catalysis can proceed. Whereas H4B radical formation is well characterized, the subsequent presumed radical reduction has not been demonstrated, and its potential mechanisms are unknown. We investigated radical reduction during a single turnover Arg hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by neuronal NOS to document the process, determine its kinetics, and test for involvement of the NOS flavoprotein domain. We utilized a freeze-quench instrument, the biopterin analog 5-methyl-H4B, and a method that could separately quantify the flavin and pterin radicals that formed in NOS during the reaction. Our results establish that the NOS flavoprotein domain catalyzes reduction of the biopterin radical following Arg hydroxylation. The reduction is calmodulin-dependent and occurs at a rate that is similar to heme reduction and fast enough to explain H4B redox cycling in NOS. These results, in light of existing NOS crystal structures, suggest a “through-heme” mechanism may operate for H4B radical reduction in NOS.

EC 1.14.13.39) are flavo-heme enzymes that catalyze a stepwise oxidation of l-arginine (Arg) to form nitric oxide (NO) and l-citrulline (1Gorren A.C.F. Mayer B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 432-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Wei C.C. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2365-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Arg is first hydroxylated by NOS in an NADPH- and O2-dependent reaction to form Nω-hydroxyl-l-arginine (NOHA) as an enzyme-bound intermediate. NOHA is then oxidized by NOS to citrulline and NO in a second NADPH- and O2-dependent reaction. The reactions take place within the NOS oxygenase domain dimer (NOSoxy), which contains bound protoporphyrin IX (heme) and 6-(R)-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B). The NOS heme catalyzes oxygen activation by a mechanism that is similar to that described for cytochrome P450 (3Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. Schlichting I. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 2253-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). However, in NOS the electron required for ferric heme reduction is provided by an attached flavoprotein domain that contains FAD, FMN, and an NADPH binding site, and heme reduction is dependent on calmodulin (CaM) binding (1Gorren A.C.F. Mayer B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 432-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Wei C.C. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2365-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). NOS enzymes also require H4B as a cofactor. H4B is bound tightly within NOS enzymes (koff ranges from 0.07 to 1.6 min-1 at 37 °C) (4List B.M. Klosch B. Volker C. Gorren A.C.F. Sessa W.C. Werner E.R. Kukovetz W.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem.

Moreover, H4B performs a novel redox function in NOS: it reduces the ferric heme-superoxy intermediate (FeIII (FeIIIO2−)) that forms during oxygen activation, and becomes an enzyme-bound H4B radical in the process (9Hurshman A.R.

Electron transfer from H4B is critical because it enables NOS to form the heme-oxy species that react with Arg or NOHA (1Gorren A.C.F. Mayer B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 432-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Wei C.C. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2365-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Several studies suggest that the H4B radical remains in NOS after it forms and must be reduced back to H4B in order for the enzyme to continue catalysis (1Gorren A.C.F. Mayer B. Biochim. Biophys.

Cederbaum S.D. Ignarro L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 40: H1988-H1998Google Scholar), places a time constraint on H4B radical reduction. Following Arg hydroxylation, the H4B radical remains in the ferric enzyme (Fig. 1, enzyme species III), and thus its reduction should require an electron from the NOS flavoprotein domain (1Gorren A.C.F. Mayer B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 432-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Wei C.C. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2365-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, enzyme species III and IV). The validity of this process and its regulation are unclear. Because CaM binding to NOS enables the flavoprotein domain to transfer electrons to the oxygenase domain heme (16Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that reduction of the H4B radical following Arg hydroxylation may also require CaM binding to NOS. To explore this possibility, we developed a means to monitor the extent and kinetics of pterin radical reduction in NOS after Arg hydroxylation occurs. Our experiments manipulate free Ca2+ levels so as to allow or prevent the CaM-dependent electron transfer between the NOS flavoprotein and oxygenase domains, as we have done previously (17Abu-Soud H.M. Presta A. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10811-10816Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We also utilize an EPR technique that can distinguish the radical signals arising from the bound pterin versus the NOS flavins during the reaction. Our results provide the first example of enzyme-catalyzed pterin radical reduction in biology, and lay a foundation to explore its mechanism and regulation in the NOS enzymes. Chemicals—H4B, H2B, and 5-methyl-H4B (5MeH4B) were obtained from Dr. Schirck's laboratory (Jona, Switzerland). A 5MeH4B stock solution was prepared fresh in 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.5. All other chemicals were obtained either from Sigma or Fisher Scientific International, Inc. UV-visible Spectrometry—Conventional spectra were obtained using a Cary 100 BIO instrument (Varian, Inc) equipped with temperature control and automatic stirring. Protein Purification—Rat nNOS was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and was purified in the absence of H4B as described previously (18Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

The enzyme concentration was determined from the 444-nm absorbance of the ferrous-CO complex using an extinction coefficient of 76 mm-1 cm-1. The individual nNOSoxy and flavoprotein domains were overexpressed and purified as described previously (19Panda K. Adak S. Aulak K.S. Santolini J. McDonald J.F. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

The concentrated proteins were stored in a buffer containing 50 mm EPPS, pH 7.5, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.25 m NaCl. Protein Sample Preparation—Ferrous nNOS was prepared by reducing CaM-bound ferric enzyme with NADPH in a gastight cuvette under anaerobic conditions as described previously (19Panda K. Adak S.

Briefly, a buffered solution containing ∼120 μm nNOS, 10 mm Arg, 2 mm 5MeH4B (or 1 mm H2B), 200 μm CaM, and 600 μm Ca2+ was made anaerobic by several cycles of vacuum and flushing with deoxygenated N2, and then had N2-purged NADPH solution added to give 0.1 to 0.2 mm NADPH. Heme reduction was monitored by the appearance of a 550-nm absorbance peak and the disappearance of the 650-nm absorbance peak. After heme reduction was judged to be complete, we added additional NADPH to give a concentration of ∼1 mm. In some cases, an anaerobic EDTA solution was then added to the ferrous NOS sample to give 1.2 mm EDTA to release the bound CaM from the ferrous nNOS. The samples were periodically scanned in the UV-visible spectrophotometer to assure that the ferrous heme did not oxidize to ferric heme prior to transfer to the rapid quench instrument. Rapid-freeze Kinetic Experiments—Ferrous nNOS samples prepared as described above were transferred with an anaerobic syringe to a rapid quench instrument (RQF-63, TGK Scientific, Bradford on Avon, UK) maintained at 10 °C, and the samples were rapid-mixed with an O2-saturated buffer (40 mm EPPS, 125 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) to initiate the reaction (this resulted in a post-mix O2 concentration in the reaction of ∼0.8 mm). The reaction mixture was then aged for various times in the instrument followed by rapid injection into a liquid N2/isopentane freezing solution as described elsewhere (21Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q.

Some replicate reactions utilized H2B-bound nNOS in the rapid-freeze EPR study, to exclusively monitor the flavin semiquinone (FSQ) radical during the single turnover reaction.

Three different nNOS preparations were used in the experiments, and each nNOS preparation was reacted under the CaM-bound and CaM-free condition on the same day. EPR Analysis—Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of each frozen reaction sample was recorded in a Bruker ER300 instrument equipped with an ER 035 NMR gauss meter and a Hewlett-Packard 5352B microwave power controller. Temperature control was achieved using Oxford Instruments ESR 900 continuous-flow liquid helium cryostat and ITC4 temperature controller. All spectra were recorded at 150 K using a microwave power of 2 milliwatts or 20 microwatts, a frequency of 9.5 GHz, a modulation amplitude of 5 G, and a modulation frequency of 100 kHz. The EPR spectrum of the 5MeH4B radical was obtained by mixing 5MeH4B-bound ferrous nNOSoxy with O2-saturated buffer and then rapid freezing after 125 ms of reaction as performed previously (12Wei C.C.

The EPR spectral properties of the flavin semiquinone radical (FSQ) were recorded for the nNOS flavoprotein domain (20Konas D.W. Takaya N. Sharma M. Stuehr D.J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2804-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The FSQ radical was generated in either protein by adding a slight molar excess of NADPH to each protein in air-saturated buffer and then waiting for the flavins to air oxidize, while monitoring FSQ formation in a UV-visible spectrophotometer as a broad peak centered near 600 nm (20Konas D.W. Takaya N. Sharma M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12596-12609Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This procedure results in both proteins containing an air-stable FMN semiquinone radical (20Konas D.W. Takaya N. Sharma M. Stuehr D.J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2804-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The microwave power dependence of each radical signal was analyzed using nonlinear regression in Equation 1, Log(S/P)=−b/2log(P1/2+P)+b/2log(P1/2)+log(A)(Eq. 1) where P is the power, S is the EPR intensity from double integration, P½ is the power at half-saturation, A is a scaling factor, and b is an inhomogeneity parameter. All fittings were performed using Origin Pro 7.5 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Determining the Concentrations of 5MeH4B and FSQ Radicals—The primary EPR spin concentration was determined using Cu(II)EDTA solutions of known concentration, and their EPR spectra recorded under conditions as described here and in earlier reports (21Wei C.C.

Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The concentration of the FSQ radical was determined based on a comparison with EPR signals from samples of the 1-electron-reduced nNOS flavoprotein domain, whose total concentration and FSQ concentration were determined by UV-visible spectroscopy using known extinction coefficients (35Konas D.W.

The dilution factors we used for correcting EPR signal intensities in the rapid-freeze-quench samples at each delay time were determined as done previously (21Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 315-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Arvai A.S. Hemann C. Hille R. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 500 μm Cu(II)EDTA solution was rapidmixed with buffer at each delay time, subject to rapid freezing, and then the EPR signal intensities of these samples were measured. The dilution factors ranged from 2-3-fold. The EPR intensities contributed by the 5MeH4B and FSQ radical in each reaction sample were calculated using Equations 2 and 3 and assuming that (i) one heme, one 5MeH4B, one FAD, and one FMN molecule were bound in each subunit of the nNOS homodimer, and (ii) only two radical species were formed (see “Results”). I(2 milliwatts,t)=IH4B, t+IFSQ, t(Eq. 2) I(20 microwatts,t)=0.1075×IH4B, t+0.4843×IFSQ, t(Eq. 3) where I(2 milliwatts, t) and I(20 microwatts, t) were the double integraions of EPR spectra of the same sample measured at 2 milliwatts and 20 microwatts power at time t, respectively. IH4B, t and IFSQ, t are only the two variables representing the intensities of 5MeH4B and FSQ radicals at 2 milliwatts. The coefficients of 0.1075 and 0.4842 in Equation 3 were determined from power saturation measurements, indicating the fold intensity dropped from 2 milliwatts to 20 microwatts. By solving Equations 2 and 3, the EPR intensities from H4B and FSQ at time t could be determined. The 5MeH4B and FSQ radicals saturate at different microwave power: At 2 milliwatts the FSQ radical is largely saturated and no longer responsive to power, whereas the 5MeH4B radical is not saturated at 2 milliwatts. The intensities we derived from Equations 2 and 3 were then converted to the concentration of individual radicals by comparison with samples of known radical concentration prepared as described above and measured at the same power setting. For example, IH4B, t is used to determine the concentration of the 5MeH4B radical by comparison with data from Cu(II)EDTA samples of known concentrations, and IFSQ, t is used to determine the concentration of the FSQ radical by comparison of data from an authentic sample of nNOS flavoprotein FSQ radical in which its radical concentration was determined by UV-visible spectrometry. Therefore, variables in Equations 1 and 2 already embed the different power saturation behaviors of the 5MeH4B and FSQ radicals. Redox State of Bound Biopterin—The oxidation state of biopterin in CaM-bound or CaM-free nNOS samples following single catalytic turnover Arg hydroxylation reactions was determined using established methods (13Wei C.C.

Approximately 70 μm nNOS protein was incubated with 0.4 mm H4B and 10 mm Arg at room temperature for 20 min and then passed through a PD-10 desalting column. Arg was then added to the protein to give a final concentration of 10 mm. A portion of the sample also received 100 μm CaM and 1 mm CaCl2, while another portion received 3 mm EDTA. The samples were made anaerobic and then reduced to ferrous by titrating with a near stoichiometric amount of dithionite solution. Approximately 0.3 ml of each anaerobic protein sample was mixed at room temperature with an equal amount of O2-saturated buffer (40 mm EPPS, pH 7.5) containing 24 μl of iodine solution (0.9% (w/v) iodine in H2O), and then was treated with standard alkaline and acidic iodine solutions used to determine concentrations of oxidized and reduced biopterin (22Fukushima T. Nixon J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). After removing the precipitated protein by centrifugation, a 50-μl aliquot from each sample was then injected onto a 4.5 × 250-mm Partisil 5μ ODS-3 column (Alltech) that was equilibrated with an aqueous 5% MeOH solution. The content of H4B and its oxidation products were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. The percentage of H4B in the samples was calculated by subtracting the area of the peak eluting at 12 min in the aliquot that had undergone basic workup from the corresponding peak area present in the companion aliquot that had undergone acidic workup. An H4B radical forms in NOS during Arg hydroxylation to NOHA (Fig. 1, enzyme species I-III). A subsequent reduction of the H4B radical is then thought to be required (Fig. 1, enzyme species III and IV) so that NOS can oxidize the bound NOHA to NO (Fig. 1). The reversible nature of CaM binding to nNOS (16Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 17Abu-Soud H.M. Presta A. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10811-10816Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) enabled us to create two populations of ferrous nNOS (i.e. CaM-bound and CaM-free versions of species I in Fig. 1) for use in Arg hydroxylation reactions. Because only the CaM-bound nNOS can engage in electron transfer between its flavoprotein and oxygenase domain heme (16Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), this setup allowed us to test whether: 1) the H4B radical that forms during Arg hydroxylation is actually reduced back to H4B, 2) the nNOS flavoprotein domain provides the electron for H4B radical reduction, and 3) the electron transfer to the H4B radical requires that CaM is bound to nNOS. We utilized nNOS because its flavoprotein-to-oxygenase domain electron transfer rate (about 4 s-1 at 10 °C; Ref. 19Panda K. Adak S. Aulak K.S. Santolini J. McDonald J.F. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

We also utilized 5MeH4B in place of H4B because it has an even faster radical formation (51 s-1) and a slower oxidative decay (0.2 s-1) in nNOS Arg hydroxylation reactions compared with H4B (12Wei C.C.

The 5MeH4B radical also has characteristic hyperfine structure that helps to distinguish it from flavin or superoxide radical species that may also form concurrently in NOS (9Hurshman A.R. Krebs C.

In general, the reactions were initiated at 10 °C by rapidly mixing an O2 saturated buffer (∼1.7 mm O2) with an anaerobic solution of NADPH pre-reduced CaM-bound or CaM-free ferrous nNOS (∼0.12 mm) that contained saturating concentrations of Arg and 5MeH4B. Following mixing, the reaction samples were aged for different times within the instrument and then underwent rapid freezing. The frozen reaction samples then had their free radical spectra and content analyzed by EPR. This procedure allowed us to study the sequential reaction steps I through IV (Fig. 1) during the Arg hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by nNOS. Under our reaction conditions, O2 binding to the ferrous heme is rapid compared with subsequent H4B radical formation and Arg hydroxylation, as indicated by the rates measured for these steps under near-identical reaction conditions (Fig. 1 and Refs. 12Wei C.C.

In our reactions we expect that EPR signals from the bound 5MeH4B radical and from the FSQ radical will be present simultaneously during the course of the Arg hydroxylation reaction. Fig. 2 shows that this was the case. The figure contains representative EPR traces of reaction samples that were aged for the indicated times during an Arg reaction catalyzed by either CaM-free (panel A) or CaM-bound (panel B) nNOS. Standard EPR spectra of the 5MeH4B radical and the nNOS FSQ radical are included in Fig. 2 for comparison. At 80 and 125 ms, the EPR traces have peak-to-trough values that range from 32 to 39 G. Because this value is close to the peak-to-trough value for authentic 5MeH4B radical (40 G) and the traces otherwise display characteristic spectral features and hyperfine structure of the 5MeH4B radical (9Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13287-13303Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Arvai A.S. Hemann C. Hille R. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it appears to be the dominant radical present in the enzyme reaction samples at these two early time points. For the 1- and 2-s reaction samples, however, the peak-to-trough width declines to approach the value of the nNOS FSQ radical (20 G), and the spectral traces lose characteristic features that indicate a disappearance of the 5MeH4B radical, particularly in the reaction catalyzed by the CaM-bound nNOS (panel B). The radical signals in these traces indicate the FSQ radical appears to become predominant in both reactions by 2 s (24Galli C. MacArthur R. AbuSoud H.M. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. Brudvig G.W.

Ligand-gated ion channels mediate the fast responses of cells to neurotransmitters (1Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). A universal feature of ligand-gated ion channels subunits is a common topology, comprising four membrane-spanning segments (M1-M4) and a huge N-terminal extracellular domain with a hyperconserved cysteine loop motif. In vertebrates, this “Cys loop” family of phylogenetically related genes codes for anion and cation channels activated by acetylcholine and serotonin (cation channels) or GABA 3The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAA, GABA, type A. and glycine (anion channels) (1Karlin A.

Despite the many years of intensive research on such ion channels, recent reports revealed unexpected new findings about this channel family. In vertebrates, a gene for zinc-gated ion channels was recently discovered (3Davies P.A. Wang W. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. J. Biol.

In insects, new classes of ligand-gated chloride channels gated by histamine or pH and cation channels gated by GABA were reported (4Zheng Y. Hirschberg B. Yuan J. Wang A.P. Hunt D.C. Ludmerer S.W.

Histamine is a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator acting on the metabotropic H1-H4 receptors (8Brown R.E. Stevens D.R. Haas H.L. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 2001; 63: 637-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). In addition, a direct activation of mammalian anion channels has been postulated (9Hatton G.I. Yang Q.Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2974-2982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Histamine-containing neurons are found exclusively in the tuberomamillary nucleus of the hypothalamus (10Haas H. Panula P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The GABA-synthesizing enzyme, glutamate acid decarboxylase, and GABA are also seen in most tuberomamillary neurons, and many neurons in the tuberomamillary nucleus contain both GABA and histamine (10Haas H. Panula P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The molecular structure of a potential mammalian histamine-gated channel is still elusive, but in invertebrates, two genes for histamine-gated channels have been identified (4Zheng Y. Hirschberg B.

Hatt H. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 372: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that a subtype of mammalian GABA receptors may be a good candidate mediating the effect of histamine in vertebrates. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Most of the rapid inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system is mediated by the GABA type A receptors (14Whiting P.J. Bonnert T.P. McKernan R.M. Farrar S. le Bourdelles B. Heavens R.P. Smith D.W. Hewson L. Rigby M.R. Sirinathsinghji D.J. Thompson S.A. Wafford K.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). GABAA receptors are heteropentameric proteins constructed of various subunits (α, β, γ, δ, θ, ϵ, and π). The most prominent native receptors are heteromultimers of α, β, and γ subunits (14Whiting P.J. Bonnert T.P. McKernan R.M. Farrar S. le Bourdelles B. Heavens R.P. Smith D.W. Hewson L. Rigby M.R. Sirinathsinghji D.J. Thompson S.A. Wafford K.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), but at least in recombinant systems, functional homomultimeric receptors composed of β or γ subunits alone exist (15Wooltorton J.R. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2225-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Cestari I.N. Uchida I. Li L. Burt D. Yang J.

Such homomultimeric ion channels differ in many aspects from the conventional, heteromultimeric GABAA receptors and were therefore candidates for receptors with unexpected new properties. GABAA cDNAs and RNAs—Rat α1 and β1 cDNAs were cloned by PCR-based methods using standard molecular biology procedures. Rat β2 cDNA was kindly provided by R. Rupprecht (Munich, Germany). Mouse γ2L and human β3 cDNA was obtained from ImaGenes (Berlin, Germany). All cDNAs were subcloned into pSGEM (courtesy of M. Hollmann, Bochum, Germany) or pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) for HEK293 cell expression. Expression of Receptor cRNA in Xenopus Oocytes—cRNAs were synthesized using the AmpliCap T7 high yield message maker kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer's protocol, with PacI-linearized pSGEM plasmids as templates. Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared by standard methods. After 24 h, stage V–VI oocytes were injected with cRNA (typically 5–25 ng/oocyte), incubated at 16 °C in Barth's solution, and tested for functional expression of GABAA receptors by two-electrode voltage clamp recording after 3–7 days. Agonists and antagonists were diluted to the concentrations indicated with Frog-Ringer's solution (115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). Recording was done with a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (TURBO TEC-03, npi, Tamm, Germany) and pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) with typical membrane potential of –40 to –60 mV. The pH of all Ringer's solutions containing histamine was adjusted to pH 7.2 if necessary. The quality of the water used for solution preparation can be critical for the amount of contamination by traces of Zn2+ or Cu2+. Previously it was shown that in native cerebral Purkinje neurons, co-application of histidine enhances GABA-evoked currents by complexing trace amounts of copper ions (20Sharonova I.N. Vorobjev V.S. Haas H.L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To exclude that the observed histamine effects depend on the complexation of such divalent cation contaminations, potentiation and dose-response curves experiments were performed in Ringer's solution prepared with ultrapure water (AMPUWA water, Fresenius, Bad Homburg, Germany) as suggested (20Sharonova I.N. Vorobjev V.S. Haas H.L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In experiments targeting the effect of histamine on heteromultimeric receptors, it was vital to ensure the absence of any contaminating population of homomultimeric channels composed of β subunits when expressing α1β2γ2 receptors as such could mimic a histamine effect. In preliminary studies with oocytes injected with a 1:1:1 ratio of α1β2γ2 subunits, in some experiments, small currents were directly evocable by 1 mm histamine, obviously caused by a small, contaminating population of homomultimeric β2 channels. Therefore, we injected an excess of α1 and γ2 over β2 subunit RNA (ratio α1:10, β2:1, γ2:2). In these oocytes, 1 mm histamine itself evoked no detectable currents (≪1% of the maximum GABA evoked current), proving the absence of a contaminating population of homomultimeric β2-subunits. The same is valid for receptors composed of α1β2 subunits, where the α subunit was also injected in a 10-fold excess over β. To ensure the incorporation of the γ2L subunit, oocytes were screened with 10 μm Zn2+ in the presence of GABA. Although αβ subunit combinations are highly sensitive for an inhibition by Zn2+, the αβγ isoforms are insensitive. Statistics—For electrophysiological measurements, statistical analysis and curve fitting was done by the Hill equation using SigmaPlot V8.0 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA). All mean values are ± S.E. Patch Clamp Experiments—HEK293 cells were maintained under standard conditions in a minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Semiconfluent cells were transfected in 35-mm dishes (BD Biosciences) by using standard calcium phosphate precipitation, 48–72 h after transfection. Recordings were performed using the whole-cell mode of the patch clamp technique. Cells were maintained in an extracellular recording solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Patch electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass and fire-polished to 4–6-megaohm tip resistance using a horizontal pipette puller (Zeitz Instruments, Munich, Germany). The pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 for recordings. Recordings were carried out using a HEKA EPC7 amplifier. Membrane potential was held at –40 mV. Homomultimeric β Channels—We investigated the action of histamine on homomultimeric GABAA receptors. Complementary RNAs (cRNA) from β2–3 subunits were expressed in X. laevis oocytes. 3–7 days after injection, histamine- and GABA-elicited currents were recorded in the voltage clamp configuration. We used the known β channel agonist pentobarbital (15Wooltorton J.R. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2225-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Cestari I.N. Uchida I.

Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 213-217PubMed Google Scholar) as a positive control and found that 3 mm histamine could also directly open homomultimeric β3 channels with an average current amplitude of 536 nA (±95, n = 15). When compared with saturating concentrations of pentobarbital, histamine evoked currents were smaller, reaching 67% (±6%, n = 8, p = 0.008) of the pentobarbital response (Fig. 1A). 3 mm histamine also opened homomultimeric β2 channels, although with lower average amplitudes (132 nA (±21, n = 7), data not shown). Dose-response curves show that homomultimeric receptors composed of β2 or β3 were similarly sensitive to histamine, with an EC50 of 212 ± 29 μm (n = 4) and an EC50 of 174 ± 14 μm (n = 11), respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). It has been reported that homomultimeric β channels are activated by GABA (15Wooltorton J.R. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2225-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Cestari I.N. Uchida I. Li L. Burt D. Yang J.

Our experiments expressing β2 or β3 confirmed the effect of GABA, but even at high, saturating GABA concentrations (3 mm), the amplitudes were only 10% of the histamine-activated currents (β3: IGABA (3 mM)/IHistamine (10 mM) = 0.11 ± 0.012 (n = 10)). GABA is a weak partial agonist when compared with histamine (Fig. 1A). Homomultimeric channels composed of GABAA β subunits are histamine-gated channels rather than GABA-gated channels. Histamine evoked a current reversing typically at –23 mV under standard ion conditions in oocytes expressing β3 (Fig. 1D), which is consistent with the previously reported chloride selectivity of β channels (15Wooltorton J.R. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2225-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The histamine effect is independent on the oocyte expression system. In whole-cell patch clamp experiments on human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells expressing β3 channels (Fig. 1E), 1 mm histamine evoked currents with an average amplitude of 203 pA (±31, n = 8), which was typically 60% of the pentobarbital response (21Taylor P.M. Thomas P. Gorrie G.H. Connolly C.N. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6360-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The EC50 of histamine with 386 μm (±24, n = 6) was in the same range as in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 1F). Pharmacology of the Histamine Response—The currents evoked by 1 mm histamine expressed in X. laevis oocytes expressing β3 were completely blocked by 10 μm picrotoxinin, but 100 μm of the GABA-antagonists bicuculline or gabazine were ineffective (data not shown). Histamine analogs such as histidine and tele-methylhistamine were also found to be agonists for β3 channels (Fig. 2A and supplemental Figs. 1 and 2), although with lower potencies (EC50 1.14 mm ± 0.15 μm (n = 5) and EC50 1.1 mm ± 0.13 μm (n = 3), respectively), demonstrating that metabolic precursors and metabolites could also be active agonists. For the histamine-binding sites of metabotropic H1–H4 receptors, specific agonists and antagonists are known (22van der Goot H. Timmerman H. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 35: 5-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We investigated whether the histamine-binding site of GABAA β subunits match one of those pharmacological profiles. In oocytes expressing β3 channels, current evoked by 300 μm histamine was effectively blocked by the H3/4 antagonist thioperamide. Higher concentrations of thioperamide additionally blocked a fraction of spontaneously open channels as indicated by the apparent “outward” current; it thus behaves like an “inverse agonist” (Fig. 2B). The IC50 was 7.2 ± 0.7 μm (n = 5) in the absence of histamine (Fig. 2D). In the presence of 300 μm histamine, the IC50 for thioperamide was 32 ± 3.8 μm (n = 5) determined by a four-parameter Hill fit of the complete blocking curve, but it would be in the range of 10 μm if one would relate it only to the histamine evoked current. Therefore, the found value is only a rough estimate as the population of open channels interferes with the analysis. Next, we tested whether thioperamide and histamine might compete for the same binding site and found that at 10 mm histamine, thioperamide was a far less effective blocker, a clear indication for a competitive mechanism (Fig. 2C). The H2 antagonist famotidine (IC50 = 154 ± 21 μm (n = 5)) and the H1/2 agonist histamine trifluoromethyl toluidide (IC50 = 162 ± 19 μm (n = 5)) were also found to be blockers of the histamine-evoked current as well as the population of open channels (supplemental Fig. 3). Other ligands for metabotropic histamine receptors, such as cimetidine (H2 antagonist), pyrilamine (H1 antagonist), and dimaprit (H2 agonist), were ineffective in concentrations up to 500 μm (data not shown). Our data reveal that the histamine-binding site of GABAA β subunits has a unique pharmacology not matching any of the metabotropic receptors. Histamine analog H2 blockers act on heteromultimeric GABAA receptors as reported previously (23Cannon K.E. Fleck M.W. Hough L.B. Life Sci. 2004; 75: 2551-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Koutsoviti-Papadopoulou M. Nikolaidis E. Kounenis G. Pharmacol. Res. 2003; 48: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Our findings may explain the molecular basis of this observed action as we found that such molecules directly act on β subunits. However, our findings imply that GABAA receptors are not specifically blocked by H2 antagonists alone but agonists or antagonists of other metabotropic histamine receptors also act. The Action of Histamine on α1β2γ2 Receptors—The action of histamine on the β subunits resembles that of allosteric GABAA modulators such as propofol and barbiturates, which also activate currents at homomultimeric β receptors directly (15Wooltorton J.R. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2225-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Cestari I.N. Uchida I. Li L. Burt D. Yang J. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 943-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Sanna E. Garau F. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 213-217PubMed Google Scholar). At heteromultimeric GABAA receptors, such modulators potentiate the action of GABA (25Korpi E.R. Grunder G. Luddens H. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 2002; 67: 113-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). To investigate the action of histamine on heteromultimeric receptors, we investigated recombinant α1β2γ2 receptors, which are the most abundant GABAA synaptic receptor type in the central nervous system (14Whiting P.J. Bonnert T.P. McKernan R.M. Farrar S. le Bourdelles B. Heavens R.P. Smith D.W. Hewson L. Rigby M.R. Sirinathsinghji D.J. Thompson S.A. Wafford K.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In oocytes expressing α1β2γ2 receptors, 1 mm histamine potentiated the current evoked by 10 μm GABA (about EC30) (Fig. 3A). The potentiation at 10 μm GABA was 1.5-fold on average (I(GABA + histamine)/I(GABA) = 1.52 ± 0.43, n = 12) but had a considerable variability, reaching from 0 in few oocytes up to 2.4-fold. In the same set of oocytes, 1 mm histamine was virtually ineffective on the current evoked by saturating concentrations (300 μm) of GABA (1.01 ± 0.06), pointing out that potentiation by histamine was significantly much more effective at submaximal GABA concentrations (p = 0.0012, n = 12). This fit to the observation that 1 mm histamine significantly lowered the EC50 for GABA from 15.8 ± 2.1 μm to 11.1 ± 1.7 μm (p = 0.0044, n = 5) (Fig. 3, A and B). 1 mm histamine itself did not evoke detectable currents (≪1% of the maximum GABA evoked current, Fig. 3A). The histamine potentiation of recombinant GABAA receptors was independent of the expression system and could also be observed at α1β2γ2 receptors expressed in HEK293 cells. Histamine showed potentiating effects similar to those in oocytes, demonstrating that the effect was not restricted to the oocyte expression system. At cells stimulated with 3 μm GABA, 1 mm histamine evoked an up to 2.0-fold potentiation of the GABA current (1.4-fold potentiation on average; n = 12) (Fig. 3C), but 1 mm histamine alone never evoked any detectable currents. The Action of Histamine on α1β2 Receptors—It is known that the presence of a γ2 subunit modulates the potentiation by allosteric modulators such as benzodiazepines, which are only effective in γ subunit-containing receptors (26Sigel E. Buhr A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In the case of potentiators acting on β subunits such as propofol, it was reported that the γ2 subunit alters the mode of potentiation (27Olsen R.W. Toxicol. Lett. 1998; 100-101: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To address the question of whether the presence of a γ2 subunit alters the potentiation of histamine, we compared the effect of histamine on heteromultimeric α1β2 and α1β2γ2 receptors. In oocytes expressing α1β2, receptors, 1 mm histamine potentiated currents evoked by GABA. Histamine potentiation was strongly dependent on the GABA concentration but in a different manner as for α1β2γ2 receptors. At α1β2 GABA receptors, 1 mm histamine potentiated best at saturating GABA concentrations (300 μm) but on average did not potentiate at submaximal concentrations of 3 μm GABA (Fig. 3, D and E). At 300 μm GABA, average potentiation was 1.26-fold (±0.24, n = 14) and significantly greater (p = 0.013, n = 14) than at 3 μm GABA in the same set of oocytes (1.04 ± 0.07, n = 14). Also in these experiments, some oocytes had GABA currents not potentiated by histamine at all. 1 mm histamine itself did not evoke detectable currents (≪1% of the maximum GABA evoked current). The average EC50 for GABA was not significantly affected by 1 mm histamine (p = 0.22, n = 4). These experiments demonstrate that the γ2 subunit has a vital, modulatory role in histamine potentiation of GABAA receptors. Histamine potentiates GABA receptors in a dose-dependent manner. At α1β2 receptors, the EC50 of potentiation is 965 μm (±306, n = 4) (Fig. 3F). The potentiation effect requires higher histamine concentrations as the direct action on homomultimeric β2 channels. Our study shows that histamine directly opens homomultimeric GABAA receptors that thus can function as histamine-gated channels. The existence of such histamine-gated chloride channels in mammals has been suggested for a long time (4Zheng Y. Hirschberg B. Yuan J. Wang A.P. Hunt D.C. Ludmerer S.W. Schmatz D.M. Cully D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2000-2005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 9Hatton G.I. Yang Q.Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2974-2982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The putative histamine receptor described by Hatton and Yang (9Hatton G.I. Yang Q.Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2974-2982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the nucleus supraopticus shares some pharmacological similarities with homomultimeric β channels (e.g. the PTX sensitivity). However, there are also some pronounced differences (e.g. the affinity for histamine and the sensitivity to cimetidine), suggesting that the native receptor may need additional components. When compared with the high affinity of metabotropic histamine receptors, the EC50 of β channels with ∼200–400 μm is quite low, and they are not expected to be activated by typical extracellular histamine concentrations in the brain. However, at synaptic transmission, high enough concentrations could be reached in the synaptic cleft as histamine concentration in synaptic vesicles be as high as 670 mm (28Borycz J.A. Borycz J. Kubow A. Kostyleva R. Meinertzhagen I.A. J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 1611-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our findings support the idea that GABAA subunits may be vital parts of potential native mammalian histamine-gated channels and could provide the histamine-binding site. Further, we demonstrated that histamine potentiates GABA responses in heteromultimeric receptors and thereby identified a new type of allosteric potentiator for GABAA receptors. The mode of potentiation resembles anesthetics such as propofol; like propofol, it targets β subunits and opens homomultimeric β channels directly but modulates the GABA response at heteromultimeric channels (15Wooltorton J.R. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2225-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Cestari I.N. Uchida I. Li L. Burt D. Yang J. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 943-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Sanna E. Garau F. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 213-217PubMed Google Scholar, 27Olsen R.W. Toxicol. Lett. 1998; 100-101: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Krasowski M.D. Koltchine V.V. Rick C.E. Ye Q. Finn S.E. Harrison N.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 30Lam D.W. Reynolds J.N. Brain Res. 1998; 784: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Also the influence of the γ2 subunit is similar. In receptors composed of α1β2 subunits, both histamine and propofol potentiate effectively at saturating GABA concentrations, increasing the maximally evoked currents. In contrast, at α1β2γ2 receptors, histamine and propofol were noneffective at high concentrations but are shifting the GABA dose-response curve leftwards (30Lam D.W. Reynolds J.N. Brain Res. 1998; 784: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In our oocyte expression system, we found that at recombinant heteromultimeric receptors, the strength of histamine potentiation was quite variable, an indication that potentiation might be regulated for example posttranscriptionally by a yet unknown mechanism. Such variability of receptor properties in recombinant expression systems is often observed and can have several reasons: for example, differences in expression level (31Taleb O. Betz H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1318-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), receptor clustering (32Chen Z.W. Olsen R.W. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 279-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and different amounts of γ subunits relative to α or β in αβγ GABAA receptors (33Boileau A.J. Baur R. Sharkey L.M. Sigel E. Czajkowski C. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 43: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), as well as different receptor phosphorylation, just to mention a few. Interestingly, phosphorylation regulates GABAA receptor potentiation by neurosteroids (34Lambert J.J. Belelli D. Peden D.R. Vardy A.W. Peters J.A. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 2003; 71: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In contrast to the variability of the histamine effect on heteromultimeric channels, exclusively all measured homomultimeric β channels responded to histamine, and none were found that only respond to GABA or pentobarbital. For GABAA receptors, about 10 different sites for allosteric modulators are known including neurosteroids, benzodiazepines, general anesthetics, and ethanol (25Korpi E.R. Grunder G. Luddens H. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 2002; 67: 113-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 35Olsen R.W. Chang C.S. Li G. Hanchar H.J. Wallner M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1675-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). With the exception of neurosteroids, no endogenous modulators have been identified so far. Our findings that histamine potentiates GABA action on GABAA receptors suggests that it is an endogenous ligand for an allosteric site located on the β subunits. Therefore, our results suggest an additional function for histamine in vivo, apart from the action on metabotropic histamine and N-methyl-d -aspartic acid receptors (36Williams K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 531-541PubMed Google Scholar). All histaminergic neurons in the mammalian brain are found in the tuberomamillary nucleus and send axons to almost all parts of the central nervous system (10Haas H. Panula P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Some of these neurons contain both GABA and histamine. In addition, histamine could diffuse out of a histaminergic synapse by a “spillout” effect as described for GABA-ergic synapses (37Rossi D.J. Hamann M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 783-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and thus may act on neighboring synaptic or extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. Further, mast cells in the brain are a source for histamine. Mast cells occur in the central nervous system of many species, and up to 50% of the brain histamine is attributable to the presence of these cells. By direct gating of channels or by affecting GABAA receptor currents, histamine should modulate processes in which rapid GABA-evoked currents participate (8Brown R.E. Stevens D.R. Haas H.L. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 2001; 63: 637-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). We thank R. Rupprecht and D.

https://openalex.org/W2008028424,"Herein we report the mechanism of human acid ceramidase (AC; N-acylsphingosine deacylase) cleavage and activation. A highly purified, recombinant human AC precursor underwent self-cleavage into α and β subunits, similar to other members of the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase superfamily. This reaction proceeded with first order kinetics, characteristic of self-cleavage. AC self-cleavage occurred most rapidly at acidic pH, but also at neutral pH. Site-directed mutagenesis and expression studies demonstrated that Cys-143 was an essential nucleophile that was required at the cleavage site. Other amino acids participating in AC cleavage included Arg-159 and Asp-162. Mutations at these three amino acids prevented AC cleavage and activity, the latter assessed using BODIPY-conjugated ceramide. We propose the following mechanism for AC self-cleavage and activation. Asp-162 likely forms a hydrogen bond with Cys-143, initiating a conformational change that allows Arg-159 to act as a proton acceptor. This, in turn, facilitates an intermediate thioether bond between Cys-143 and Ile-142, the site of AC cleavage. Hydrolysis of this bond is catalyzed by water. Treatment of recombinant AC with the cysteine protease inhibitor, methyl methanethiosulfonate, inhibited both cleavage and enzymatic activity, further indicating that cysteine-mediated self-cleavage is required for ceramide hydrolysis.

Human acid ceramidase (AC; 3The abbreviations used are: AC, acid ceramidase; Ntn, N-terminal nucleophile; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; MMTS, methyl methanethiosulfonate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Bis/Tris, 2-(bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. 3The abbreviations used are: AC, acid ceramidase; Ntn, N-terminal nucleophile; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; MMTS, methyl methanethiosulfonate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Bis/Tris, 2-(bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. N-acylsphingosine deacylase; EC 3.5.1.23) hydrolyzes the sphingolipid, ceramide, into sphingosine and free fatty acid. AC is considered a lysosomal enzyme since it has optimal in vitro activity at acidic pH, and most of the lipid storage in Farber disease patients (the genetic disorder resulting from the deficiency of this enzyme) occurs within late endosomes and/or lysosomes (1Moser, H., Linke, T., Fensom, A. H., Levade, T., and Sandhoff, K. (2001) in The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease (Scriver, C. R., Beaudet, A. L., Sly, W. S., and Valle, D., eds) pp. 3573–3588, McGraw-Hill, New YorkGoogle Scholar). It is therefore thought that the main function of AC is to participate in lysosomal membrane turnover. A low level, secreted form of AC also has been described (2Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol.

Commun. 2000; 275: 746-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), although its biological function remains unknown. In addition to its important housekeeping function in sphingolipid metabolism, AC participates in signal transduction pathways that regulate various physiological and pathological processes. Recently, it was shown that the AC gene (Asah1) is among the first genes expressed in newly formed mouse embryos, and its deficiency causes embryo death at the two-cell stage (5Eliyahu E. Park J.H. Shtraizent N. He X. Schuchman E.H. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 1403-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, many studies have reported the involvement of AC in complex diseases. For example, AC is overexpressed in several types of human cancer (prostate, head and neck squamous cell, etc.) (6Seelan R.S. Qian C. Yokomizo A. Bostwick D.G. Smith D.I. Liu W. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2000; 29: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 7Elojeimy S. Liu X. McKillop J.C. El-Zawahry A.M. Holman D.H. Cheng J.Y. Meacham W.D. Mahdy A.E. Saad A.F.

Moreover, impaired ceramide metabolism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes, Alzheimer disease, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis (10Chavez J.A. Holland W.L.

Pathol. 1997; 151: 1257-1263PubMed Google Scholar). Although the precise role of AC in these common diseases is unknown, the enzyme is likely to act as a rheostat controlling the levels of ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate in cells and/or extracellular spaces (15Strelow A. Bernardo K. Adam-Klages S. Linke T. Sandhoff K. Kronke M. Adam D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). AC purified from human urine was an ∼50-kDa glycoprotein that could be resolved into individual 14- and 40-kDa subunits (α and β, respectively) under reducing conditions (2Bernardo K. Hurwitz R.

The isolation of the full-length cDNAs and genes encoding human and murine AC revealed that the two subunits were derived from a single precursor by proteolytic processing (2Bernardo K. Hurwitz R.

However, the mechanism of AC precursor cleavage remains unclear. A PSI-BLAST search (16Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar) for the AC sequence revealed high homology with the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolase family (17Pei J. Grishin N.V. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The Ntn hydrolases are a diverse superfamily of enzymes that differ in their substrates, but the mechanism of their activation is conserved. Each is synthesized as a preprotein, and an autocatalytic, endoproteolytic process transforms them into mature multimers. An amino group of an amino acid nearby the cleavage site acts as the proton acceptor and activates the nucleophilic thiol in a Cys residue at the cleavage site (or the nucleophilic hydroxyl in a Ser or Thr residue). After the cleavage of the zymogen, the nucleophilic Cys is exposed at the N-terminal side of the β subunit, which serves as the enzyme active site. All known members of the Ntn hydrolyase family catalyze the hydrolysis of amide bonds in either proteins or small molecules (18Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C. Smith J.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Through a combination of protein purification, site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemical studies, the data in this study demonstrate that AC undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage and activation similar to other members of the Ntn hydrolase superfamily. Namely, AC undergoes the transition from an inactive precursor into a mature heterodimer through autocatalytic self-cleavage. These studies provide a novel perspective on the function of AC and its regulation. They also provide new insights into the effects of individual Farber disease mutations on AC folding and processing and suggest novel ways of regulating AC activity and sphingolipid signaling. In addition, they should facilitate the design of a new class of AC-specific inhibitors that could potentially be used in cancer and other therapies.

Protein Expression and Purification—The human AC cDNA was overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using a methotrexate gene amplification system (20He X. Okino N. Dhami R. Dagan A. Gatt S.

Polyclonal anti-AC antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was covalently cross-linked to protein A-coupled magnetic beads (Dynal, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated with overexpressing (CHO6) media collected after 24 h of culture. AC bound to the antibody-ProteinA-bead complex was eluted using 0.1 m citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Igepal, 10% glycerol. In Vitro, Autoproteolytic Cleavage Analysis—Purified AC precursor or cell lysates were incubated at 4 or 37 °C. At various times, an aliquot was withdrawn and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described below. Western Blot Analysis—Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using 12% precast NuPAGE Bis/Tris gels under reducing conditions and MES running buffer (Invitrogen) and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) and NuPAGE-MOPS transfer buffer. For immunoblot analysis, membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline/Tween containing 5% dry milk and then incubated with mouse monoclonal IgM against AC (specific for the α subunit). Bound antibodies were recognized by secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Detection was performed by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) using a Kodak M35A X-OMAT processor. Approximate molecular masses were determined by comparison with the migration of prestained protein standards (Bio-Rad). Silver Staining—For detection of proteins by silver staining, at least 1 μg of total protein from cell lysates or 50 ng of pure protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE separation using 12% precast NuPAGE Bis/Tris gels under reducing conditions and MES running buffer (Invitrogen). The proteins were visualized using a silver staining kit (Owl, Portsmouth, NH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The full-length human AC cDNA was subcloned in-frame into the pcDNA4/HisMaxTOPO vector (Invitrogen). To introduce point mutations into the AC cDNA, the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene was used (catalog number 200518). Primers were constructed for PCR site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's instructions. The newly synthesized cDNA constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Transient Transfection and AC Overexpression—The hAC-pcDNA/HisMaxTOPO constructs were preincubated with the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) transfection reagent in Optimem media according to the commercial instructions. DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 complexes were then added to 293T cells cultured overnight in 0.5 ml of antibiotic free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium media. After 24 h, the treated cells were harvested, centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and kept at –20 °C. For protein extraction from 239T cells, cell pellets were lysed with the CelLytic reagent (Sigma) and centrifuged (18,000 × g) to obtain protein lysates. AC Activity Assay—The AC activity assay was performed as described previously (20He X. Okino N. Dhami R. Dagan A. Gatt S. Schulze H. Sandhoff K. Schuchman E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32978-32986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, pure protein or cell lysates were incubated for 22 h at 37 °C with 0.1 ng/μl BODIPY-conjugated C12-ceramide in 0.1 m citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% detergent Igepal CA-630 (Sigma). After the reactions were complete, 5 μl of the assay mixtures was removed and added into 95 μlof ethanol, mixed, and then centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatants were then transferred to a Waters glass sampling vial, and 5 μl (2.5% of the original reaction mixture) was autosampled by a WIPS 712 (Waters) autosampler onto a high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a reversephase column (BetaBasic-18, 4.6 × 30 mm, Keystone Scientific Inc., Bellefonte, PA), and eluted isocratically with methanol/water (95:5 v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fluorescence was quantified using a Waters 474 fluorescence detector set to excitation and emission wavelengths of 505 and 540 nm, respectively. The undigested substrate and product (i.e. BODIPY-conjugated C12-ceramide and fatty acid, respectively) peaks were identified by comparing their retention times with standards, and the amount of product was calculated using a regression equation that was established from a standard curve using BODIPY-conjugated C12 fatty acid. Kinetics of AC Processing—The kinetics of AC cleavage was analyzed to determine whether AC processing could be described as a first order reaction, characteristic of self-cleavage. To calculate the reaction order, p, we compared the reaction rate for two concentrations of the precursor (C1 and C2): r1/r2 = 2p. For a first order reaction, if [C1]:[C2] = 1:2, then r1:r2 = 1:2, and p = 1. To calculate the rate of AC cleavage, we used the following equation: r = k[C]), where [C] is the concentration of precursor, estimated by Western blot densitometry, and k is the rate constant, represented by the natural logarithm of the precursor concentration, ln(dC), as a function of incubation time, dt, (k = ln(dC)/dt). AC Processing at Different pH Values—Culture media from cells overexpressing recombinant AC was collected after 24 h of confluent culture and dialyzed into a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Igepal, and 100 mm citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, or 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5. Samples were dialyzed using dialysis cassettes with a molecular mass cut-off of 7 kDa (Pierce). The dialyzed samples were incubated for 4–24 h at 37 °C and subjected to SDS-PAGE separation and Western blotting using mouse monoclonal IgM against AC (specific for the α subunit). Changes in precursor and processed protein were expressed as the relative density of the precursor and α subunit bands on Western blot as determining using the ImageJ software. Inhibition of AC Processing and Activity—AC processing was followed for 24 h in the presence of 0.1 mm methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) to test the effect of this reversible cysteine protease inhibitor on the transition of precursor into the dimer form. AC activity also was measured, as described above, in the presence of 0.1, 5, or 10 mm MMTS to test its effect on ceramide hydrolysis. Protein Expression and Purification—To test the possibility of AC self-cleavage, we purified human AC from the media of overexpressing CHO cells using a new method designed for purification of mainly the precursor form (Fig. 1A). For maximal purification, we used magnetic separation technology and a goat polyclonal antibody against the AC protein. Silver staining showed that there was significant enrichment of AC in the elution fractions when compared with the input (Fig. 1A). Three AC-related bands were identified, representing the AC precursor, β and α subunits at apparent molecular masses of ∼55, 40, and 14 kDa, respectively. Other bands evident in the silver-stained gels represent antibody and protein A leaking from the beads. Western blotting analysis using a monoclonal antibody specific for the AC α subunit confirmed that the purification process resulted in highly enriched fractions of pure AC, mostly in the precursor form (Fig. 1B). Having the majority of the purified AC in the precursor form allowed us to follow changes in AC cleavage by comparing the levels of precursor and α subunit (the latter representing the processed form of AC) over time. Autocatalytic Processing of AC—AC contains a conserved domain characteristic of the Ntn hydrolase superfamily (17Pei J. Grishin N.V. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To test the possibility of AC autocatalytic processing, similar to Ntn hydrolases, we incubated pure AC (Fig. 1, Elution fraction 2) at 37 °C and pH 7, conditions favorable for proteolysis. Samples at time 0 and 96 h were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody recognizing the AC precursor and α subunit. The results revealed a marked decrease in the amount of precursor and a corresponding increase in the α subunit after the incubation period (Fig. 2). Site-directed Mutagenesis—To further investigate the precursor processing mechanism, as well as to characterize the catalytic site, we generated point mutations in the AC protein. Human AC processing into the α and β subunits involves proteolytic cleavage between amino acid residues 142 and 143. Cysteine 143 at the N terminus of the β subunit is a conserved cleavage site for AC and AC-like proteins from Caenorhabditis elegans through human, as shown in Fig. 3A. It is also conserved among many members of the Ntn hydrolase superfamily (17Pei J. Grishin N.V. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since there are currently no data regarding AC structure, we modeled the tertiary structure of the AC β subunit using the crystal structure of cholylglycine hydrolase (PDB code: 2bjg), one member of the Ntn hydrolase family, as a template (Fig. 3, B and C). This allowed us to predict amino acids that might be in close proximity to Cys-143 and could also be involved in the catalysis of self-cleavage. Those candidates should be able to accept proton from Cys-143 and thus polarize it to become a nucleophile or to stabilize the tertiary structure to allow the angle of the peptide bond to be exposed to nucleophilic attack. In addition, those candidates should be conserved in AC from different species and in other members of the Ntn hydrolase family. Based on this analysis, likely candidates included: Arg-159, His-157, and Asp-162 (Fig. 3, B and C). These amino acids were therefore mutated to a non-functional Gly, and the effects on processing were analyzed. We also mutated Cys-143 to other nucleophilic amino acids (Thr or Ser) or to the non-functional Ala. By doing this, we aimed to obtain a mature, functionally active AC with a nucleophilic amino acid at the cleavage site other then Cys. This would allow us to test whether Cys-143 is essential for the self-cleavage by following AC processing in the presence of cysteine protease inhibitors. Mutation at Arg-296, an amino acid that is also conserved in the AC family and in the Ntn hydrolase superfamily, but located far from the cleavage site, served as a negative control. For the purpose of mutagenesis, we subcloned the human AC cDNA into the pcDNA/HisMaxTOPO vector and introduced single nucleotide changes that altered the specific amino acids. The wild-type and mutant cDNAs were then transiently transfected into 293T17 cells, and the transfection efficiency, as well as the in situ processing of the expressed enzyme, were assessed by subjecting cell lysates to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody specific for the human AC precursor and α subunit. As shown in Fig. 4A, the R159G, D162G, C143T, C143S, and C143A mutations each prevented in situ AC precursor cleavage as no α subunit was observed in 293 cell lysates following transient transfection. In contrast, the H157G mutation did not prevent AC processing since the level of α subunit in this cell lysate was similar to that of wild-type. The R296G mutation also underwent processing, although to a somewhat lesser degree than wild type. Substitution of Cys-143 to a different nucleophilic amino acid (e.g. C143S or C143T) also prevented processing. To test whether the mutations delayed or completely blocked cleavage, we incubated the cell lysates at 37 °C for a total of 72 h (Fig. 4B). No increase in α subunit was observed. Activity assays were also performed on the cell lysates as described previously (2Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11098-11102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Each of the mutants at Cys-143, Arg-159, or Asp-162 lacked enzymatic activity. Others had activity comparable with that of wild-type. These results indicate that amino acids Arg-159, Asp-162, and Cys-143 are functional amino acids required for AC proteolytic processing and activity. Kinetic Analysis of AC Processing—To further characterize AC processing, we examined the kinetics of the transition of AC from a precursor into the α and β subunits. We followed AC processing by monitoring the increase in α subunit at 24- or 72-h intervals, as described above, and plotted the relative density of the bands on Western blots as a function of incubation time. As shown in Fig. 5A, the in vitro half-life for AC cleavage from precursor to α subunit was about 17 h (Fig. 5A). To determine the reaction order, we then followed the processing of AC at two different input concentrations (Fig. 5B) and calculated the reaction rates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We observed that increasing the initial concentration of AC precursor led to a corresponding increase in the reaction rate (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the reaction was classified as first order. This type of kinetics is characteristic of autoproteolysis and further defines AC processing as a self-cleavage event that does not involve other proteases. Inhibition of AC Activity and Processing by the Cysteine Protease Inhibitor MMTS—As part of our hypothesis, we propose that Cys-143, when exposed on the N terminus of the β subunit after cleavage, serves as the active site for ceramide hydrolysis. To test this concept, we monitored AC activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of the cysteine protease inhibitor MMTS (Fig. 6). We also followed AC processing in the presence of MMTS for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 6A, AC activity was inhibited by MMTS in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting analysis further revealed that a 24-h incubation of AC with 0.1 mm MMTS inhibited processing completely (Fig. 6B). Taken together, these results confirm that one or more cysteines are involved in both AC autoproteolytic processing and ceramide hydrolysis. Due to its high conservation and location at the N terminus of the β subunit, Cys-143 stands out as a potential candidate for both of these functions. AC Processing at Different pH Values—The translocation of AC into lysosomes is thought to be a prerequisite for precursor processing. However, ceramide signaling is thought to occur at the cell membrane or other non-acidic compartments. Thus, we investigated the processing of AC at various pH values. For this purpose, we used media obtained from CHO6 cells that overexpress and secrete human AC and dialyzed into buffers at pH 4.5 or 7, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Processing of AC at different pH values was assessed as described above, and the results showed that acidic conditions accelerated the rate of AC processing. However, some precursor processing also occurred at neutral pH (Fig. 7). AC is synthesized as a precursor with an apparent molecular mass of ∼55 kDa. It is processed through the vesicular transport system, probably initiated by the presence of an N-terminal signal peptide sequence. When routed into the Golgi, AC undergoes a series of post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation of sugar residues. Mature precursor also undergoes cleavage into α and β subunits with apparent molecular masses of 14 and 40 kDa, respectively. Glycosylation of AC seems to be required for precursor processing, probably by controlling proper protein folding (21Ferlinz K. Kopal G. Bernardo K. Linke T. Bar J. Breiden B. Neumann U. Lang F. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35352-35360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4951) Google Scholar). Small amounts of AC also are secreted and may be incorporated back into cells and delivered to lysosomes via mannose-6-phosphate receptors present on the cell surface. AC translocation into the lysosomes is thought to be a prerequisite for precursor processing. The presence of mature, cleaved heterodimer in the cell culture media was attributed to acidic proteases that might be secreted into the media (21Ferlinz K. Kopal G. Bernardo K. Linke T. Bar J. Breiden B. Neumann U. Lang F. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35352-35360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To date, there are no data regarding the mechanism of AC cleavage and the potential protease involved, as well as the precise subcellular location of the cleavage event. Herein we provide new insights into the mechanism of AC processing and activation. Purification of an enriched precursor fraction of AC allowed us to demonstrate that this enzyme is capable of self-cleavage. Site-directed mutagenesis also identified functional amino acids involved in AC self-cleavage. Furthermore, kinetic analysis of AC processing confirmed that AC cleavage is most likely an autoproteolytic event. In addition, inhibition studies showed that Cys-143 is required for both AC processing and AC activity. Finally, we observed that AC cleavage can be accelerated by acidic pH but also occurs at neutral pH. Based on these data, we propose a mechanism to describe AC autocatalytic transformation from a precursor into active enzyme (Fig. 8). The process could be initiated by conformation change and/or removal of a physiological inhibitor. Based on our model, Asp-162 is located 2.89 Å from Cys-143, allowing formation of a hydrogen bond (Fig. 3C). The formation of this bond stabilizes a new conformation that is favorable for the amino group of Arg-159, which is located 3.36 Å from Cys-143, to accept a proton from the side chain sulfydril. The latter becomes a polar nucleophile and can form a thioether intermediate bond with the carbon atom of the carboxyl group of Ile-142. The hydrolysis of the thioether bond is catalyzed by a water molecule, resulting in cleavage of the peptide bond between Cys-143 and Ile-142. Cys-143, exposed on the N terminus of the β subunit, remains a powerful nucleophile and thus may potentially serve as an active site for ceramide hydrolysis. Based on the results of site-directed mutagenesis, Cys-143, Arg-159, and Asp-162 are the functional triad catalyzing AC cleavage and activation, and for this matter, could be defined as a catalytic center of the enzyme. Mutation at these amino acids resulted in the loss of AC activity, strongly suggesting that the precursor form of AC has no activity as a ceramide hydrolase and that AC processing is a prerequisite of AC activation. Inhibition studies confirmed that the activity of AC as a ceramide hydrolase requires cysteine in the active site as it can be inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitor MMTS. We attempted to confirm that the position of the cysteine is indeed Cys-143 by substituting Cys-143 to Thr or Ser, assuming that the activity of these mutant proteins would not be affected by MMTS. However, neither of these substitutions permitted precursor processing, supporting the significance of Cys-143 in both AC cleavage and AC activity. To undergo cleavage, the nucleophilic cysteine should be in a free state, not associated in a disulfide bond. Whether Cys-143 is a free cysteine remains unknown, although our model of secondary structure based on sequence homology with other proteins suggests that Cys-143 is far from other cysteines in the β subunit (Fig. 3). It is probable that it also does not form disulfide bonds with the α subunit as replacing Cys-143 by other amino acids did not affect AC post-translational modifications (e.g. glycosylation); i.e. the precursor showed the same migration pattern on SDS-PAGE as wild-type protein. The full answer could be obtained from solving the crystal structure of the protein. It is notable that a recent publication examining the structure of recombinant AC purified from insect cells by mass spectroscopy found that Cys-143 was likely involved in a disulfide bond (23Schulze H. Schepers U. Sandhoff K. Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, in this study, the recombinant AC studied was fully processed into the α and β subunits. In contrast, our studies were performed on a highly enriched precursor form (obtained from the media of CHO cells), and it is important to note that our model of AC self-cleavage only requires that Cys-143 be in a free state in the precursor form. Whether this residue is involved in a disulfide bond after cleavage and thus serves as a nucleophile for ceramide hydrolysis remains a question that awaits the final crystal structure. Further, we verified that AC processing exhibits the kinetics of a first order reaction, characteristic of any self-cleavage process. This finding is in agreement with our other conclusions about the autoproteolytic activity of AC. Finally, we observed that AC processing occurs most efficiently in vitro at acidic pH, confirming previous reports suggesting that under normal growth conditions, most AC processing likely occurs in acidic organelles (e.g. endosomes or lysosomes) (21Ferlinz K. Kopal G. Bernardo K. Linke T. Bar J. Breiden B. Neumann U. Lang F. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35352-35360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, we also observed that some AC processing proceeds at neutral pH, suggesting that AC activation may occur in other intracellular compartments. To fully investigate this point, in the future, careful subcellular localization studies must be carried out under various growth conditions to assess the state of AC processing in various cell compartments. In normal cells, the levels of ceramide are carefully regulated. Ceramide may be formed by several pathways, but the only way to degrade ceramide into sphingosine is through the activity of ceramidases. Maintaining a balance between the levels of ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate is an important component of cell survival or death. AC activity cannot be compensated by other ceramidases as deletion of AC is lethal at early stages of embryonic development in the mouse, and reduced AC activity in Farber disease patients often leads to death during early childhood. The data presented here provide new insights into one important mechanism of ceramide regulation: i.e. AC cleavage and activation. Moreover, in some types of cancer, up-regulation of the AC gene renders the tumors more resistant to ceramide- and/or chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Thus, inhibition of AC might restore the sensitivity of cancer cells to exogenous ceramides or treatment with chemotherapeutic agents known to produce ceramide (24Savtchouk I.A. Mattie F.J. Ollis A.A. Sci. STKE. 2007; 394: jc1Google Scholar). Current techniques for AC inhibition are based on using ceramide analogs as inhibitors or anti-AC small interfering RNA. Ceramide analogs, although useful in cell culture, have questionable specificity and may affect multiple cellular pathways (8Selzner M. Bielawska B. Morse M.A. Rüdiger H.A. Sindram D. Hannun Y.A.

Small interfering RNAs have limited stability and inhibit gene expression, not protein function. Based on our results, which support AC autocatalytic self-cleavage, we are now able to identify functional amino acids required for AC activation and are initiating the analysis of a new class of AC inhibitors that act by inhibiting AC processing. Such inhibitors would be potentially more specific and more tolerable when used in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1982212379,"We have recently demonstrated that specific oxidized phospholipids (oxPCCD36) accumulate at sites of oxidative stress in vivo such as within atherosclerotic lesions, hyperlipidemic plasma, and plasma with low high-density lipoprotein levels. oxPCCD36 serve as high affinity ligands for the scavenger receptor CD36, mediate uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein by macrophages, and promote a pro-thrombotic state via platelet scavenger receptor CD36.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which macrophage accumulation of cholesterol and subsequent foam cell formation are critical events. Accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages is a result of failure to adequately adjust cellular cholesterol efflux in conditions of dramatically increased cholesterol acquisition.

One of the key steps in reverse cholesterol transport is binding of HDL in the liver to hepatocyte SR-BI followed by selective uptake of cholesteryl esters (CE) from HDL. Multiple studies employing various murine models of atherosclerosis demonstrated that hepatic SR-BI is atheroprotective (1Arai T. Wang N. Bezouevski M. Welch C. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Processes that interfere with SR-BI-mediated selective uptake of CE are of particular interest because they are potentially proatherogenic and may represent novel mechanisms contributing to the development of atherosclerosis. SR-BI belongs to the evolutionarily conserved CD36 family of proteins, sharing 30% sequence identity with CD36 (5Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SR-BI is an 82-kDa membrane glycoprotein containing a large extracellular domain and two transmembrane domains with short cytoplasmic amino- and carboxyl-terminal tails (6Krieger M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 523-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Similar to CD36 it is a multifunctional protein; however, its major function is selective uptake of CE from HDL in steroidogenic tissues. SR-BI-mediated selective uptake of HDL CE is a two-step process. The first step involves lipoprotein binding to the extracellular domain of SR-BI, and the second step is the selective transfer of lipid from HDL to the plasma membrane. SR-BI shares with CD36 an affinity for a wide array of ligands, including native and modified lipoproteins, advanced glycation end products, and anionic phospholipids (7Acton S. Rigotti A.

Atherosclerosis is associated with oxidative stress and the generation of biologically active oxidized lipids.

Based on the close protein similarity between CD36 and SR-BI, we hypothesized that oxPCCD36 species would also serve as ligands for SR-BI and therefore could interfere with SR-BI-dependent processes. In this study we demonstrate that oxPCCD36 bind specifically to SR-BI and that binding of oxPCCD36 prevents HDL association because of the close proximity of the binding sites for these two ligands on SR-BI. We then demonstrate that oxPCCD36 is a potent inhibitor of SR-BI-mediated selective uptake of cholesteryl esters in hepatocytes. Thus, our results suggest that specific oxidized phospholipids accumulated in vivo in oxidative stress may inhibit reverse cholesterol transport and contribute to the development of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.

Anti-SR-BI blocking antibody was purchased from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. General Procedures—All buffers were passed over a column of Chelex-100 resin and supplemented with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid to remove any potential transition metal ions, which might catalyze phospholipid oxidation during incubations. Protein content was determined by the Markwell-modified Lowry protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard (15Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5346) Google Scholar). LDL and HDL were isolated from fresh plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation, and iodination with Na125I was performed as described previously (16Podrez E.A. Schmitt D. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Total synthesis of γ-keto-α,β-unsaturated aldehydic phospholipid, the 5-keto-8-oxo-6-octenoic acid esters of 2-lyso-PC (KOOA-PC), was performed as described earlier (14Podrez E.A. Poliakov E. Shen Z.

Lipoprotein Modification—LDL was modified utilizing the (MPO-H2O2-NO2−) system by incubating LDL (0.2 mg of protein/ml) at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 30 nm MPO, 100 μg/ml glucose, 20 ng/ml glucose oxidase, and 0.5 mm NaNO2 for 8 h (16Podrez E.A. Schmitt D. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Oxidation reactions were terminated by addition of 40 μm butylated hydroxytoluene and 300 nm catalase to the reaction mixture. LDL acetylation and oxidation of LDL by copper ions were performed as described previously (17Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). Phospholipid Vesicle Preparation and Modification—Stock solutions (2 mg/ml) of small unilamellar vesicles consisting of PAPC, PLPC, or POPC were prepared in argon-sparged sodium phosphate buffer by extrusion (11 times) through a 0.1-μm polycarbonate filter using an Avanti Mini-Extruder Set (Avanti Polar Lipids) at 37 °C (14Podrez E.A. Poliakov E. Shen Z. Zhang R. Deng Y. Sun M. Finton P.J. Shan L. Gugiu B. Fox P.L. Hoff H.F. Salomon R.G. Hazen S.L. J. Biol.

For direct binding experiments, [3H]DPPC (25 μCi/mg of phospholipids) was added to phospholipids (PAPC or PLPC) with equimolar amounts of specific synthetic oxidized phospholipids (oxPCCD36). Phospholipid vesicles oxidized by reactive nitrogen species were prepared from PAPC or PLPC vesicles (0.2 mg lipid/ml) by exposure to the MPO-H2O2-NO–2 system as described (16Podrez E.A. Schmitt D. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Cells—Hep G2 cells were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). CHO cells lacking LDL receptor activity (ldlA7 cells) and a subcloned cell line expressing scavenger receptor class B type I (ldlA7-SR-BI) (a gift from Dr. M. Krieger, MIT, Boston) were cultured as described elsewhere (18Ashkenas J. Penman M. Vasile E. Acton S. Freeman M. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 983-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For generating the SR-BI overexpressing HEK-293T cell line, full-length human SR-BI was PCR-amplified from liver Marathon-Ready cDNA (BD Biosciences) and cloned into the pEF6V5-His vector (Invitrogen). HEK-293T cells were stably transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) using blasticidine as the selection marker. Clones overexpressing SR-BI were selected based on Western blot for SR-BI. Experiments were performed on confluent cell monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, butylated hydroxytoluene (20 μm), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (100 μm), and catalase (300 nm). Selective Uptake of Cholesteryl Ester in Hepatocytes—Phospholipid liposomes containing [3H]cholesteryl oleate ether (COE) were prepared as described elsewhere (19Greene D.J. Skeggs J.W. Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4804-4811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and incubated with HDL in the presence of excess cholesteryl ester transfer protein and 0.5% BSA at 37 °C for 18 h. HDL was then re-isolated by ultracentrifugation and dialyzed. Specific activity of resulting [3H]COE HDL was 4 cpm/ng HDL protein. Hep G2 cells were cultured for 18 h in the presence of 0.1 μm adrenocorticotropic hormone in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 media containing 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum. Selective uptake of cholesteryl esters was determined as described before (19Greene D.J. Skeggs J.W. Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4804-4811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, parallel experiments to assess HDL uptake were performed using [3H]COE HDL and 125I-HDL. After 5 h of incubation at 37 °C with indicated lipoproteins, the medium was removed, and the cells washed with warm PBS. Following a 30-min chase with 100 μg/ml unlabeled HDL, cells were lysed and cell-associated radioactivity was quantified. Degradation of 125I-HDL was determined as described before (16Podrez E.A. Schmitt D. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), and total uptake of HDL protein was calculated as the sum of the 125I associated with cells plus the noniodide-, nontrichloroacetic acid-precipitable 125I in the medium. Selective uptake was calculated as the difference between total lipid uptake (3H radioactivity) and the amount of lipid incorporation that could be accounted for by whole lipoprotein uptake as determined by the accumulated cellular 125I. Cloning and Purification of GST-SR-BI Ligand Binding Domain Fusion Protein—The sequence encoding full-length human SR-BI was amplified by PCR from liver Marathon-Ready cDNA and subcloned into the PCR-blunt vector (Invitrogen). A fragment containing a putative human HDL ligand-binding site, an extracellular amino-terminal domain of SR-BI (amino acids 144–205), was amplified by PCR with appropriate primers and cloned between BamHI and XbaI sites of the pGST-Parallel1 vector. The junction with GST was sequenced to confirm insertion of SR-BI-(144–205) in-frame. GST fusion protein expression in transformed Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; cells were lysed, and fusion protein was isolated by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare). The size, amount, and purity of the fusion protein were examined by SDS-PAGE. The molecular weight was found to be close to the predicted value, and purity was typically >95%. Lipoprotein and Phospholipid Vesicle Binding Experiments—Cells were washed with serum-free medium, and the indicated amounts of 125I-labeled lipoproteins were added in 250 μl of the appropriate media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Lipoprotein binding to SR-BI expressing CHO cells (ldlA7-SR-BI) and control vector cells (ldlA7) was determined following 3 h of incubation at 37 °C with the indicated concentrations of native or modified forms of 125I-labeled lipoproteins (17Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). In competition experiments, 125I-labeled lipoproteins (5 μg/ml) were incubated with cells in the presence of the indicated concentrations of unlabeled competitor. For phospholipid vesicle binding experiments, cells (0.25–0.3 mg of cell protein/well) were incubated with the corresponding radiolabeled phospholipid vesicles (10 μg/ml, 250 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of 40-fold excess of unlabeled POPC vesicles to block nonspecific binding. Unbound vesicles were then washed from cells with PBS/BSA; cells were solubilized with 0.1 m NaOH, and bound radioactivity was quantified. GST-SR-BI binding experiments were performed by incubating GST or GST-SR-BI-(144–205) protein beads (1 μg of protein/tube) with the corresponding phospholipid vesicles containing the radioactive tracer (14Podrez E.A. Poliakov E. Shen Z. Zhang R. Deng Y. Sun M. Finton P.J. Shan L. Gugiu B. Fox P.L. Hoff H.F. Salomon R.G. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38503-38516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) at 10 μg lipid/ml in PBS for 3 h at 25 °C with gentle shaking. Unbound vesicles were removed from the beads by repeated washing with PBS, and then bound radioactivity was quantified. HDL binding and competition assays were performed by incubating 125I-HDL (5 μg/ml) in PBS with GST or GST-SR-BI-(144–205) beads (1 μg of protein/tube) for 3 h at 25 °C. In competition experiments, unlabeled competitors were added at 20-fold excess. Where indicated, the beads were preincubated for 15 min with anti-SR-BI blocking antibody. HDL binding parameters for HEK-293T cells overexpressing SR-BI and GST-SR-BI-(144–205) fusion protein were obtained from nonlinear regression analysis in Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego). Statistics—Each experimental point represents the mean ± S.D. for triplicate determinations of a representative experiment performed at least three times. Statistical analyses were made using a paired Student's t test. For all hypotheses, the significance level was 0.05. When multiple comparisons were made, a Bonferoni correction to the significance criterion for each test was made. oxPCCD36 Represent Ligands for SR-BI—SR-BI is closely related to scavenger receptor CD36 and shares with CD36 several ligands, including oxLDL (13Podrez E.A.

We hypothesized that oxLDL could bind to SR-BI via specific oxidized phospholipids (oxPCCD36) that were previously shown to be ligands for CD36. LDL oxidized by reactive nitrogen species generated by the MPO-H2O2-NO2-system (NO2-LDL) is a carrier of oxPCCD36 and represents a biologically relevant and well characterized model of oxidized LDL that selectively binds to CD36 (13Podrez E.A. Febbraio M. Sheibani N. Schmitt D. Silverstein R.L. Hajjar D.P. Cohen P.A. Frazier W.A. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin.

Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38503-38516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). First, we tested whether NO2-LDL was recognized by SR-BI and whether oxPCCD36 present in NO2-LDL serve as ligands for SR-BI. 125I-Labeled NO2-LDL binding to SR-BI-overexpressing CHO cells was significantly higher than control cells (Fig. 1a). Binding of 125I-acLDL (a specific ligand for the scavenger receptor class A) was low (data not shown). Native LDL and LDL oxidized by alternative methods (e.g. Cu2+) also bound to SR-BI-overexpressing cells in agreement with previous reports (22Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 23Nishikawa K. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5226-5231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of SR-BI-mediated recognition of 125I-labeled NO2-LDL was verified by competition experiments. Excess amounts of unlabeled NO2-LDL effectively competed with 125I-labeled NO2-LDL for binding to SR-BI-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1b). In contrast, a 40-fold molar excess of native LDL had no significant effect (Fig. 1b). An anti-SR-BI blocking antibody significantly inhibited binding of 125I-labeled NO2-LDL to SR-BI-overexpressing cells, whereas an isotype-matched nonimmune antibody had no effect (Fig. 1b). These findings confirmed that LDL modified by the (MPO-H2O2-NO2−) system was recognized specifically by SR-BI. We then tested whether SR-BI recognized NO2-LDL via its oxidized phospholipid moiety. Small unilamellar vesicles comprised of synthetic homogeneous phosphatidylcholine molecular species were oxidized by the (MPO-H2O2-NO2−) system (NO2-PAPC) and then tested for their ability to compete for 125I-labeled NO2-LDL binding to SR-BI-overexpressing cells. NO2-PAPC significantly inhibited binding of 125I-labeled NO2-LDL (Fig. 1b) indicating that free (not bound covalently to protein) oxidized phospholipid, in NO2-LDL, served as at least one of the ligands for SR-BI. A similar pattern of recognition was demonstrated by our group previously for CD36 (11Podrez E.A. Poliakov E. Shen Z. Zhang R. Deng Y. Sun M. Finton P.J. Shan L. Febbraio M. Hajjar D.P.

Because CD36 and SR-BI belong to the same family of proteins and share evolutionally conserved domains, these results suggest that CD36 and SR-BI recognize NO2-LDL via similar mechanisms. We next examined individual synthetic phospholipids previously identified by our group as specific endogenous ligands for CD36 (oxPCCD36) (14Podrez E.A. Poliakov E. Shen Z. Zhang R. Deng Y. Sun M. Finton P.J. Shan L. Gugiu B. Fox P.L. Hoff H.F. Salomon R.G. Hazen S.L. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 1b, oxPCCD36 (data for KOOA-PC are shown), but not their unoxidized phospholipid precursors (data for PAPC are shown), inhibited binding of 125I-labeled NO2-LDL to SR-BI-expressing cells. To demonstrate that oxPCCD36 directly bind to SR-BI, small unilamellar vesicles containing PLPC or PAPC as a carrier lipid, synthetic oxPCCD36 species, and tracer levels of [3H]DPPC were made and binding assays were performed as described previously (14Podrez E.A. Poliakov E. Shen Z. Zhang R. Deng Y. Sun M. Finton P.J. Shan L. Gugiu B. Fox P.L. Hoff H.F. Salomon R.G. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38503-38516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Vesicles comprised of PAPC (or PLPC, data not shown) alone failed to demonstrate SR-BI-specific binding (Fig. 1c). However, the NO2-PAPC and NO2-PLPC vesicles bound to SR-BI transfected cells at significantly greater levels than control cells (Fig. 1c and data not shown). Vesicles containing any of the individual synthetic oxPCCD36 (data for KDdiA-PC are shown) readily bound to SR-BI-expressing cells (Fig. 1c). Addition of a blocking anti-SR-BI antibody, but not isotype-matched control antibody, inhibited binding of the oxPCCD36 vesicles further demonstrating specificity. These data demonstrate that SR-BI, similar to CD36, recognizes oxPCCD36. oxPCCD36 Interfere with HDL Binding to SR-BI Because of Overlap of Binding Sites—We next tested whether NO2-LDL or oxPCCD36 interfered with SR-BI-mediated HDL binding. Binding of HDL to SR-BI-expressing cells was significantly higher than vector-transfected cells as anticipated (Fig. 2a). Excess unlabeled HDL and anti-SR-BI blocking antibody, but not isotype-matched nonimmune antibody, inhibited binding to the SR-BI-transfected cells down to the level of binding to vector-transfected cells, demonstrating specificity. Forty-fold molar excess of unlabeled NO2-LDL competed with 125I-HDL for binding to SR-BI (Fig. 2a). In contrast, native LDL failed to significantly block the binding of HDL to SR-BI-transfected cells. NO2-PAPC significantly inhibited binding of 125I-HDL, in agreement with the results in Fig. 1, b and c. At the same time, native unoxidized PAPC was found to be a weak competitor (Fig. 2a). Finally, small unilamellar vesicles containing individual synthetic oxPCCD36 (data for KDdiA-PC are shown) were potent inhibitors of 125I-HDL binding to SR-BI. Collectively, these results show that LDL and phospholipids vesicles upon oxidation acquire the ability to block HDL binding to SR-BI because of oxPCCD36. SR-BI is a multiligand receptor, one potential mechanism for the observed inhibition is that the binding sites for HDL and oxPCCD36 on SR-BI overlap. To test this hypothesis an extracellular amino-terminal domain of human SR-BI (amino acids 144–205) containing the putative HDL ligand-binding site was expressed as a GST fusion protein, isolated and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, and used in binding and competition studies. The selection of this SR-BI-(144–205) peptide was based on separate studies of lipoprotein binding domains in CD36, a close relative of SR-BI that can also bind HDL (24Calvo D. Gomez-Coronado D. Suarez Y. Lasuncion M.A. Vega M.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 777-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Gu X. Trigatti B. Xu S. Acton S. Babitt J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26338-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Binding of 125I-HDL to GST-SR-BI-(144–205) was significantly higher than control GST beads (Fig. 2b). Binding was specific because excess unlabeled HDL significantly inhibited binding of 125I-HDL. Importantly, the anti-SR-BI blocking antibody inhibited HDL binding to GST-SR-BI-(144–205) protein to the same extent as in SR-BI-expressing cells (Fig. 2b), suggesting that GST-SR-BI-(144–205) contains the true binding site for HDL. Other properties of the 125I-HDL-binding site on GST-SR-BI-(144–205) mirrored those of the full-length SR-BI expressed on cells. Specifically, NO2-PAPC and vesicles containing individual synthetic oxPCCD36 were potent inhibitors of 125I-HDL binding (results for KDdiA-PC are shown), whereas vesicles consisting of native unoxidized PAPC or PLPC were weak competitors (Fig. 2b, data for PAPC are shown). Direct binding experiments demonstrated that small unilamellar vesicles comprised of PAPC or PLPC alone failed to bind significantly to GST-SR-BI-(144–205) (Fig. 1c and data not shown), whereas NO2-PAPC and vesicles containing any of the individual synthetic oxPCCD36 (data for KDdiA-PC are shown) were found to bind to GST-SR-BI-(144–205) at significantly greater levels than control GST (Fig. 2c). Addition of the anti-SR-BI antibody, but not isotype-matched control antibody, blocked binding of the vesicles containing oxPCCD36. Comparison of SR-BI-overexpressing cells and purified GST-SR-BI-(144–205) fusion protein showed similar saturable HDL binding curves (Fig. 2d). The values for half-maximal concentration for HDL binding were similar, 5.6 ± 0.5 μg/ml for cells overexpressing SR-BI and 4.6 ± 0.1 μg/ml for the GST fusion protein. Together these results suggest that the ligand-binding site of SR-BI lies in the region between amino acids 144 and 205 and that the binding sites for HDL and oxPCCD36 on SR-BI overlap. oxPCCD36 Bind to Hepatocyte SR-BI and Interfere with SR-BI-mediated Selective Cholesteryl Uptake—Selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl esters in hepatocytes is a major physiological function of SR-BI and is a critical part of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway in the body. Because oxPCCD36 accumulate in plasma under conditions of increased oxidative stress and dyslipoproteinemia, and are associated with atherosclerosis development (10Podrez E.A. Byzova T.V. Febbraio M.

We first used NO2-LDL to test whether hepatocytes recognize this mildly modified form of oxidized LDL via SR-BI and whether oxPCCD36 present in NO2-LDL serve as ligands for hepatocyte SR-BI. Hep G2 cells bound significant amounts of 125I-labeled NO2-LDL (Fig. 3a). SR-BI was the major receptor on Hep G2 cells for 125I-labeled NO2-LDL because an anti-SR-BI blocking antibody but not isotype-matched nonimmune antibody significantly inhibited binding. Excess amounts of unlabeled HDL but not native LDL effectively competed with 125I-labeled NO2-LDL for binding to Hep G2 cells (Fig. 3a). In agreement with the data obtained using SR-BI-overexpressing cells, binding was significantly inhibited by oxPCCD36 but not by native unoxidized phospholipids. These findings demonstrated that LDL modified by the MPO-H2O2-NO–2 system was recognized specifically by SR-BI on hepatocytes via its oxidized phospholipid moiety. We next investigated the effect of oxPCCD36 on the binding of 125I-HDL to Hep G2 cells. Hep G2 cells bound significant amounts of 125I-HDL, as anticipated. Excess of unlabeled HDL and anti-SR-BI blocking antibody, but not isotype-matched nonimmune antibody, inhibited 125I-HDL binding to Hep G2 cells demonstrating specificity of the binding. Importantly, excess of all competitors containing oxPCCD36, including unlabeled NO2-LDL, NO2-PAPC and vesicles containing individual synthetic oxPCCD36 significantly inhibited binding of 125I-HDL to SR-BI (Fig. 3b), in agreement with the results in Fig. 2. In contrast, native PAPC or PLPC (data for PAPC are shown) had no significant effect on the binding (Fig. 3b). To demonstrate that oxPCCD36 directly bind to SR-BI on hepatocytes, small unilamellar vesicles containing PLPC or PAPC as a carrier lipid, synthetic oxPCCD36 species, and tracer levels of [3H]DPPC were made, and binding assays were performed as in Fig. 1c. Vesicles comprised of PAPC (or PLPC, data not shown) alone failed to demonstrate significant binding to Hep G2 cells (Fig. 3c). NO2-PAPC vesicles bound to SR-BI-transfected cells at significantly greater levels than PAPC vesicles (Fig. 3c). Vesicles containing individual synthetic oxPCCD36 (data for KOdiA-PC are shown) readily bound to Hep G2 cells (Fig. 3c). Blocking anti-SR-BI antibody, but not isotype-matched control antibody, inhibited binding of the oxPCCD36 vesicles to hepatocytes, demonstrating that SR-BI is the major receptor for oxPCCD36 on hepatocytes. Finally, we tested the effect of ligands containing oxPCCD36 on SR-BI-mediated [3H]cholesteryl ester association, 125I-HDL uptake, and selective cholesteryl ester uptake using small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. Native PAPC had a mild effect on cholesteryl ester association, 125I-HDL uptake, and selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl esters in Hep G2 cells (Fig. 4, a–c). At the same time, vesicles containing oxPCCD36 significantly inhibited all tested SR-BI-mediated processes (Fig. 4, a–c). Importantly, oxPCCD36 not only significantly reduced holoparticle uptake of HDL as evidenced by decreased uptake of 125I-HDL (Fig. 4b), it also almost completely inhibited hepatocyte selective uptake of cholesteryl esters (Fig. 4c). This result strongly suggests that oxPCCD36 also interferes with the second step of SR-BI-mediated selective uptake, i.e. lipid transfer from HDL to the cell membrane. An earlier report suggested that reverse cholesterol transport may be proportional to cell surface expression of SR-BI (26Shetty S. Eckhardt E.R. Post S.R. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 2125-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). No change in surface expression of SR-BI was observed in Hep G2 cells pretreated with either HDL or with HDL plus oxPCCD36 for the periods of time used in this experiment (data not shown). Taken together, these results support our hypothesis that ligands for SR-BI that contain oxPCCD36 compete for the binding of HDL to SR-BI and disrupt SR-BI-mediated cholesteryl ester selective uptake from HDL. Pro-atherosclerotic lipid abnormalities are associated with enhanced oxidative stress and the generation of biologically active oxidized lipids. Oxidized phospholipids accumulate at sites of oxidative stress, including plasma and in the vessel wall (10Podrez E.A. Byzova T.V. Febbraio M. Salomon R.G. Ma Y. Valiyaveettil M. Poliakov E. Sun M.

In this study we show that a recently described family of specific oxidized phospholipids represents a ligand for the scavenger receptor BI and interferes with the major physiological function of SR-BI, namely selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from HDL. We demonstrated the following: (i) oxPCCD36 are recognized by SR-BI when presented in various forms. (ii) oxPCCD36 interfered with HDL binding to SR-BI because of an overlap of binding sites for oxPCCD36 and HDL on SR-BI. (iii) oxPCCD36 prevented SR-BI-mediated selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from HDL in hepatocytes. These observations suggest a novel pro-atherogenic activity of specific oxidized phospholipids: an inhibition of reverse cholesterol transport. SR-BI belongs to the CD36 family of proteins that is well known for multiligand specificity. SR-BI and CD36 share significant sequence homology and ligands, including HDL, oxidized LDL, and anionic phospholipids (28Jessup W. Gelissen I.C. Gaus K. Kritharides L. Curr. Opin.

Based on the close similarity between CD36 and SR-BI, we hypothesized that oxPCCD36 could serve as ligands for SR-BI as well. Using direct binding and competition assays, we demonstrated that SR-BI binds oxidized LDL in the same fashion as CD36, via recognition of oxPCCD36 formed during oxidative modification of LDL. SR-BI is intimately involved in HDL metabolism in vivo (30Rigotti A. Miettinen H.E. Krieger M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 357-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 31Yancey P.G. Bortnick A.E.

Based on 125I-labeled NO2-LDL and oxPCCD36 binding studies, we hypothesized that oxPCCD36 could interfere with the ability of SR-BI to mediate cholesterol transport to and from HDL. Our competition experiments using 125I-HDL as a ligand and various competitors containing oxPCCD36 demonstrated that oxPCCD36 significantly reduced HDL binding to SR-BI, and thus affect HDL-mediated processes. To elucidate whether the observed inhibition is because of spatial hindrance or more complex cellular events, we performed competition experiments using the extracellular amino-terminal domain of human SR-BI (amino acids 144–205) containing the putative HDL ligand-binding site. Importantly, the Kd value of the binding of HDL to this protein was very similar to that determined for the full-length SR-BI expressed on cells (Fig. 2, a, b, and d). Moreover, an anti-SR-BI blocking antibody inhibited HDL binding to GST-SR-BI-(144–205) peptide, strongly suggesting that it contains the true binding site for HDL. NO2-PAPC and vesicles containing synthetic oxPCCD36 bound specifically to GST-SR-BI-(144–205) with a Kd value similar to that for HDL (Fig. 2c and data not shown). Others have reported that a M158R mutant does not bind either HDL or LDL (32Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29993-30001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) in agreement with our data. Taken together, these results suggest that the ligand-binding sites for both HDL and oxPCCD36 on SR-BI lie in the region of amino acids 144–205 and that the binding sites for HDL and oxPCCD36 on SR-BI overlap, thus providing the molecular basis for the observed competition between the two ligands on cells. Our results suggest that under conditions of increased oxidative stress, accumulation of specific oxidized phospholipids may promote atherosclerosis not only by inducing uptake of modified lipoproteins by macrophages via CD36, but can also interfere with reverse cholesterol transport by preventing SR-BI-mediated selective cholesteryl ester uptake in hepatocytes.

https://openalex.org/W1996497996,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of human diseases. A cytosine to adenine transversion in the mitochondrially encoded NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (mt-ND2, human; mt-Nd2, mouse) gene results in resistance against type 1 diabetes and several additional ROS-associated conditions. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the adenine-containing allele (mt-Nd2(a)) is also strongly associated with resistance against type 1 diabetes in mice. In this report we have confirmed that the cytosine-containing allele (mt-Nd2(c)) results in elevated mitochondrial ROS production. Using inhibitors of the electron transport chain, we show that when in combination with nuclear genes from the alloxan-resistant (ALR) strain, mt-Nd2(c) increases ROS from complex III. Furthermore, by using alamethicin-permeabilized mitochondria, we measured a significant increase in electron transport chain-dependent ROS production from all mt-Nd2(c)-encoding strains including ALR.mt(NOD), non-obese diabetic (NOD), and C57BL/6 (B6). Studies employing alamethicin and inhibitors were able to again localize the heightened ROS production in ALR.mt(NOD) to complex III and identified complex I as the site of elevated ROS production from NOD and B6 mitochondria. Using submitochondrial particles, we confirmed that in the context of the NOD or B6 nuclear genomes, mt-Nd2(c) elevates complex I-specific ROS production. In all assays mitochondria from mt-Nd2(a)-encoding strains exhibited low ROS production. Our data suggest that lowering overall mitochondrial ROS production is a key mechanism of disease protection provided by mt-Nd2(a)."
https://openalex.org/W2072537237,"Normal development of the immune system requires regulated processing of NF-kappaB2 p100 to p52, which activates NF-kappaB2 signaling. Constitutive production of p52 has been suggested as a major mechanism underlying lymphomagenesis induced by NF-kappaB2 mutations, which occur recurrently in a variety of human lymphoid malignancies. To test the hypothesis, we generated transgenic mice with targeted expression of p52 in lymphocytes. In contrast to their counterparts expressing the tumor-derived NF-kappaB2 mutant p80HT, which develop predominantly B cell tumors, p52 transgenic mice are not prone to lymphomagenesis. However, they are predisposed to inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by multiorgan infiltration of activated lymphocytes, high levels of autoantibodies in the serum, and immune complex glomerulonephritis. p52, but not p80HT, represses Bim expression, leading to defects in apoptotic processes critical for elimination of autoreactive lymphocytes and control of immune response. These findings reveal distinct signaling pathways for actions of NF-kappaB2 mutants and p52 and suggest a causal role for sustained NF-kappaB2 activation in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2075220377,"Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) refers to a naturally occurring mixture of positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid. Evidence suggests that CLA is a dietary constituent and nutraceutical with anti-cancer, insulin-sensitizing, immunomodulatory, weight-partitioning, and cardioprotective properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of intervention with CLA on cardiac hypertrophy. In vitro, CLA prevented indicators of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy elicited by endothelin-1, including cell size augmentation, protein synthesis, and fetal gene activation. Similar anti-hypertrophic effects of CLA were observed in hypertrophy induced by angiotensin II, fibroblast growth factor, and mechanical strain. CLA may inhibit hypertrophy through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). CLA stimulated PPAR activity in cardiomyocytes, and the anti-hypertrophic effects of CLA were blocked by genetic and pharmacological inhibitors of PPAR isoforms α and γ. CLA may disrupt hypertrophic signaling by stimulating diacylglycerol kinase ζ, which decreases availability of diacylglycerol and thereby inhibits the protein kinase Cϵ pathway. In vivo, dietary CLA supplementation significantly reduced blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive heart failure rats. These data suggest that dietary supplementation with CLA may be a viable strategy to prevent pathological cardiac hypertrophy, a major risk factor for heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2023039221,"HCV NS3 helicase exhibits activity toward DNA and RNA substrates. The DNA helicase activity of NS3 has been proposed to be optimal when multiple NS3 molecules are bound to the same substrate molecule. NS3 catalyzes little or no measurable DNA unwinding under single cycle conditions in which the concentration of substrate exceeds the concentration of enzyme by 5-fold. However, when NS3 (100 nm) is equimolar with the substrate, a small burst amplitude of ∼8 nm is observed. The burst amplitude increases as the enzyme concentration increases, consistent with the idea that multiple molecules are needed for optimal unwinding. Protein-protein interactions may facilitate optimal activity, so the oligomeric properties of the enzyme were investigated. Chemical cross-linking indicates that full-length NS3 forms higher order oligomers much more readily than the NS3 helicase domain. Dynamic light scattering indicates that full-length NS3 exists as an oligomer, whereas NS3 helicase domain exists in a monomeric form in solution. Size exclusion chromatography also indicates that full-length NS3 behaves as an oligomer in solution, whereas the NS3 helicase domain behaves as a monomer. When NS3 was passed through a small pore filter capable of removing protein aggregates, greater than 95% of the protein and the DNA unwinding activity was removed from solution. In contrast, only ∼10% of NS3 helicase domain and ∼20% of the associated DNA unwinding activity was removed from solution after passage through the small pore filter.

Helicases are molecular motors that catalyze unwinding of double-stranded DNA or RNA by converting chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical energy for nucleic acid strand separation. Helicases are required for virtually all cellular processes involving nucleic acids, including replication, transcription, translation, repair, and recombination (1Delagoutte E. von Hippel P.H. Q.

The quaternary structure of the active forms of helicases varies considerably, with some requiring dimer or oligomer formation for strand separation activity and others functioning efficiently as monomers. Bacteriophage T4 gp41 helicase, for example, forms a hexameric structure that sequesters single-stranded DNA by encircling it (6Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Numerous other helicases function as hexamers (7Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev.

In order to understand the mechanism by which helicases unwind duplex DNA, the quaternary structure of the active species must be known. More than 170 million people worldwide are infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), 4The abbreviations used are: HCV, hepatitis C virus; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; nt, nucleotide(s); SSB, single-stranded binding protein. predominantly through blood-borne routes, such as contaminated blood/blood product transfusion and shared needle injection (11McHutchison J.G. Am. J. Manag. Care. 2004; 10: S21-S29PubMed Google Scholar). The great majority (85%) of patients develop chronic HCV infection characterized by subclinical but persistent and progressive inflammation and fibrosis of the liver, which can ultimately result in liver cirrhosis, hepatic failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV infection has become the primary reason for liver transplants among adults in Western countries (12Pearlman B.L. South. Med. J. 2004; 97: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, current therapy is inadequate in treating all patients afflicted with chronic HCV, and an urgent medical need exists for an effective anti-HCV agent (13Choo Q.L. Weiner A.J. Overby L.R. Kuo G. Houghton M. Bradley D.W. Br. Med. Bull. 1990; 46: 423-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). HCV contains a positive single-stranded RNA genome that encodes a polyprotein of about 3010 amino acids that is processed into structural (capsid, E1, E2, and p7) and nonstructural (NS2, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5a, and NS5b) proteins by cellular and virus-encoded proteases (14Bartenschlager R. Lohmann V. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1631-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The NS3 protein is a 631-amino acid residue bifunctional enzyme with a serine protease localized to the amino-terminal 180 residues and an NTPase-RNA helicase located in the carboxyl-terminal 451 residues (15Kim D.W. Gwack Y. Han J.H. Choe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, the kinetic and chemical mechanisms for NS3h or full-length NS3 remain an active area of investigation. The full-length form of HCV NS3 is a bifunctional enzyme consisting of protease and helicase domains. Both protease and helicase activities are required for viral replication. NS3 has a 3′-to-5′ directional bias, unwinds both RNA and DNA, and binds preferentially to U-rich or dT-rich nucleic acid substrates (21Gwack Y. Kim D.W. Han J.H. Choe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Serebrov and Pyle (27Serebrov V. Pyle A.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) have reported that, based on comparison of concentration-dependent processivity and binding data, the active form of NS3 helicase is a dimer with an 18-bp kinetic step size.

The results for NS3h have been interpreted in terms of functional cooperativity, which does not rely on strong protein-protein interactions. In the functional cooperativity model, NS3h is active as a monomer, but the presence of multiple molecules increases processivity. A similar model has been put forth for Dda helicase (9Byrd A.K.

Hence, the presence of the protease domain clearly influences the interaction of NS3 with nucleic acid. The protease domain has also been reported to facilitate dimerization of NS3 (34Khu Y.L. Koh E.

In this work, we have investigated the quaternary form of NS3 by using chemical cross-linking and biophysical approaches as well as DNA unwinding measurements under pre-steady state conditions. Materials—A high pressure liquid chromatography column (Bio-Sil SEC 250-5 column) and gel filtration molecular weight marker standard (molecular weight range 1,350–670,000) were purchased from Bio-Rad. HEPES, β-mercaptoethanol, SDS, MOPS, Tris, NaCl, Na4EDTA, BSA, acrylamide, bisacrylamide, MgCl2, KOH, formamide, xylene cyanole, bromphenol blue, urea, and glycerol were purchased from Fisher. BS3 was purchased from Pierce. The Silver Stain Plus kit and 4–15% Tris-Cl Ready Gels were purchased from Bio-Rad. Sephadex G-25, PK/LDH, NADH, ATP, and PEP were from Sigma. Polyuridine was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. DNA oligonucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies and purified by preparative gel electrophoresis. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from New England Biolabs. Recombinant full-length NS3 was derived from the HCV Con 1b replicon consensus sequence and was purified as described (26Tackett A.J. Chen Y. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10797-10806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). NS3h was also derived from the HCV Con 1B replicon consensus sequence and was purified as described (35Mackintosh S.G. Lu J.Z. Jordan J.B. Harrison M.K. Sikora B. Sharma S.D. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D.

Steady State DNA Unwinding—NS3 (100 nm) was prepared in 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. DNA substrate (15 nt/30 bp, the overhang strand radiolabeled with 32P) was added to 100 nm, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The unwinding reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2 (unless otherwise specified), and a 30-fold excess of DNA trap to bind the displaced strand and prevent reannealing to the radiolabeled product. After 1–10 min, a 10-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was transferred to a centrifuge tube containing 200 mm EDTA, 0.7% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 6% glycerol. The double- and single-stranded DNA were resolved via native 20% polyacrylamide gel. The radiolabeled substrate and product were detected using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation was performed with ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare), and the ratio of single- to double-stranded DNA was plotted as a function of time. Data were fit to a linear function using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Single Turnover and Pre-steady State DNA Unwinding—NS3 (500 nm) and DNA substrate (2 nm 15 nt/30 bp, the longer strand radiolabeled with 32P) were prepared in 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. Reaction components were incubated at 37 °C using a circulating water bath. The unwinding reaction was initiated by the rapid addition of 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2 (unless otherwise specified), 30-fold excess DNA trap, and 10-fold excess polyuridine protein trap using an RQF-3 Rapid Quench Flow instrument (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). The reaction was quenched after 0.1–10 s by adding 200 mm EDTA and 0.7% SDS. Bromphenol blue (0.1%), 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 6% glycerol were added to each, and the double- and single-stranded DNA were resolved via native 20% polyacrylamide gel. The radiolabeled substrate and product were detected using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation was performed with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences), and the ratio of single- to double-stranded DNA was plotted as a function of time. Data were fit to a two-step mechanism for DNA unwinding as described (26Tackett A.J. Chen Y. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10797-10806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Chemical Cross-linking—Chemical cross-linking was carried out by incubating NS3/NS3h (final concentration is 2 μm) in a buffer containing 50 mm MOPS K+ (pH 7.0), 10 mm NaCl at 37 °C. After 30 min, BS3 (2 mm in H2O) was added to a final concentration of 500 μm. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed at various time points, quenched by adding 1 m glycine (pH 8.0) and protein sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 0.45% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.004% bromphenol blue), incubated at 100 °C for 5 min, analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4–15% gradient gel), and visualized by silver staining. Another chemical cross-linking was carried out by incubating NS3 (final concentration is 2 μm) in the same buffer as above along with poly(dT) (varying concentrations) at 37 °C. After 30 min, BS3 (2 mm in H2O) was added to a final concentration of 500 μm. After 20 min, the reaction was quenched. The reaction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4–15% gradient), and protein was visualized by silver staining. Dynamic Light Scattering—The hydrodynamic radii of wild type NS3 and NS3h were measured by dynamic light scattering using a DynaPro MS/X dynamic light scattering instrument from Protein Solutions, Inc. NS3 was used at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, whereas NS3h was used at 1.0 mg/ml. Additionally, 50 μl of each sample was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. The quartz cell was regulated at 20 °C. Measurements were made at a fixed angle of 90° using an incident laser beam of wavelength 830 nm. Twenty measurements were made with an acquisition time of 10 s for each measurement. The data were analyzed using the graphical size analysis software, Dynamics, provided with the instrument. High Pressure Gel Filtration Chromatography—Gel filtration was carried out at room temperature using a Bio-Sil SEC 250-5 column (300 × 7.8 mm). Elution was monitored by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. 20 μl of molecular weight standard mixtures were injected into the column with running buffer containing 100 mm K2HPO4, KH2PO4 (pH 7.0), and 10 mm or 150 mm NaCl. NS3 or NS3h was incubated for 5 min in running buffer before being injected onto the column. Protein Filtration through Small Pore Filters—Whatman Anotop disposable syringe filters (ThermoFisher) were used to remove oligomeric protein from solution for NS3 and NS3h. An aliquot of protein (100 μl) was allowed to thaw on ice and then passed through the filter (0.1 or 0.02 μm). Equal volumes of filtered or unfiltered protein were then assay for protein concentration by using a modified Bradford assay (Pierce). ATPase Assays—Identical volumes of filtered or unfiltered NS3 or NS3h were examined for ATPase activity by using the phosphoenolpyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay (36Runyon G.T. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4128-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The specific activity for ATP hydrolysis was calculated, assuming that the entire enzyme concentration passed through the filter. NS3 or NS3h was incubated with 5 mm ATP in 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 15 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 0.9 mm NADH. ATP hydrolysis rates were determined by measuring the conversion of NADH to NAD+ at 380 nm in the presence of 100 μm polyuridine. Hydrolysis rates were calculated using an extinction coefficient of 1,210 m-1 cm-1 for NADH. Kinetic Simulations of DNA Unwinding under Pre-steady State Conditions—We have previously shown that the Dda and TraI helicases can unwind DNA substrates as monomeric enzymes (8Nanduri B. Byrd A.K. Eoff R.L. Tackett A.J. Raney K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14722-14727Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Sikora B. Eoff R.L. Matson S.W. Raney K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36110-36116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We used a functional approach in which the active form of these two enzymes was determined by using an active site titration. DNA unwinding experiments were performed under pre-steady state conditions in which the substrate concentration exceeded the enzyme concentration. Under pre-steady state conditions, the quantity of product in the first cycle of DNA unwinding is reflective of the quantity of active enzyme and is referred to as the burst amplitude of the reaction. For Dda and TraI, the burst amplitude was similar to the concentration of enzyme, indicating that each helicase was capable of unwinding DNA in a monomeric form. Dda is only capable of unwinding short duplexes (low processivity), whereas TraI appears to be capable of unwinding much longer duplexes (high processivity). A kinetic model for a two-step process for unwinding a 30-bp DNA substrate is shown in Fig. 1A. The model was designed to simulate DNA unwinding by NS3 helicase. Only two kinetic steps are required for unwinding a 30-bp substrate, because NS3 has a very large kinetic step size of ∼18 bp (27Serebrov V. Pyle A.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); however, smaller, physical steps occur during the slow, rate-limiting kinetic step (28Dumont S. Cheng W. Serebrov V. Beran R.K. Tinoco Jr., I. Pyle A.M. Bustamante C. Nature. 2006; 439: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 37Myong S. Bruno M.M. Pyle A.M. Ha T. Science. 2007; 317: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The kinetic scheme allows the enzyme to dissociate from the substrate according to rate constant kd, or unwind the substrate to form a partially unwound intermediate, ES*. The enzyme substrate intermediate can dissociate or undergo a second unwinding step to produce product. For the kinetic simulation, ku was set at 2.0 s-1, which was the fastest rate constant that was measured for DNA unwinding in a previous report (26Tackett A.J. Chen Y. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10797-10806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The concentration of enzyme substrate complex (ES) was set at 50 nm, based on preincubation of 50 nm enzyme with excess concentration of substrate (250 nm). The dissociation rate constant was initially set at 0 s-1, which simulates an infinitely processive helicase. If NS3 is assumed to function as a monomer, then the kinetic simulation shows clearly that 50 nm NS3 should produce 50 nm ssDNA product under these conditions (Fig. 1B, filled squares). As the dissociation constant increases from 0 to 8 s-1, the quantity of product declines. Hence, a helicase can produce less than the expected burst amplitude due to low processivity. NS3 can unwind most of the 30-bp substrate (15 nt/30 bp) under single turnover conditions in the presence of a large excess of enzyme concentration over substrate concentration (Fig. 1C) (26Tackett A.J. Chen Y. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10797-10806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The fact that most of the substrate (∼80%) was converted to product in the presence of excess enzyme indicates that NS3 can be relatively processive, but it says nothing about the form of the protein that is responsible for unwinding the substrate, because the enzyme is in excess of the substrate. When NS3 (50 nm) was incubated with excess substrate (250 nm), no product was observed (Fig. 1D, filled circles). If monomeric NS3 exhibited the level of DNA unwinding activity suggested by the data in Fig. 1C, then 40 nm ssDNA product should be observed, because ∼80% of the bound enzyme would be expected to unwind the DNA. However, little or no product is actually observed under these conditions. If the protein trap is removed, then some product is observed over time (open circles in Fig. 1D), indicating that NS3 is somewhat active under these conditions. We conclude that a monomeric form of NS3 is not responsible for rapid, processive DNA unwinding as observed in Fig. 1C. NS3-catalyzed DNA Unwinding Is Fast and Relatively Processive When Enzyme Concentration Is in Excess of Substrate Concentration—It is possible that the lack of a highly active monomeric form of NS3 is due to less than optimal reaction conditions. For example, binding of NS3 to DNA is sensitive to the concentration of salt in the reaction mixture. The conditions for conducting DNA unwinding may influence the rate and amplitude of product formation when the concentration of NS3 is in excess of the substrate. We examined several different concentrations of ATP and MgCl2. NS3 (500 nm) was incubated with the 15-nt/30-bp substrate (2 nm), and the reaction was initiated upon the addition of ATP. Similar rates and amplitudes for product formation were observed regardless of whether the concentration of ATP was equal to, greater than, or less than the concentration of MgCl2 (supplemental Fig. 1). The addition of varying concentrations of detergent reduced the rate slightly but did not change the amplitude for unwinding (supplemental Table 1). Under all conditions studied, the fraction of substrate converted to product and the rate of unwinding were similar. Hence, the species of NS3 responsible for unwinding the 30 base pairs of DNA under conditions of excess enzyme is a relatively fast and processive form of the enzyme under a variety of conditions. NS3-catalyzed DNA Unwinding Exhibits a Non-zero Intercept When Substrate Is in Excess of Enzyme—We have already shown that no burst amplitude is observed when the substrate concentration exceeds the enzyme concentration by 5-fold (Fig. 1C). If NS3 forms an active species, such as a dimer, then it might be possible to observe a burst amplitude for DNA unwinding when the enzyme concentration is equal to or in slight excess of the substrate concentration. The dissociation constant for the 15-nt/30-bp DNA substrate was previously reported to be 2.7 nm when measured by gel shift assay and 5.2 nm when measured by fluorescence polarization (26Tackett A.J. Chen Y. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10797-10806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We conducted DNA unwinding experiments at 100 nm DNA and 100 nm NS3 in order that enzyme and substrate would be well above the dissociation constant. NS3 was incubated with the 15-nt/30-bp DNA substrate followed by initiation of unwinding by mixing with ATP and MgCl2. Varying the concentration of ATP (Fig. 2A) and MgCl2 (Fig. 2B) and the addition of varying concentrations of detergent (Tween 20) had little effect on the steady state rate of unwinding. The observed rates for product formation ranged from 2.0 to 4.2 nm/min. These data all exhibit a non-zero intercept at the y axis, indicating a small burst amplitude, which ranged from 8 to 16 nm. The magnitude of the burst amplitude is much lower than expected for a monomeric or dimeric enzyme. If a monomer or dimer is the only active species and is the primary form of NS3 in solution, then a much higher burst amplitude would be observed based on the rate and processivity measured under conditions of excess enzyme (Fig. 1C). One possible explanation for the low burst amplitude is that the most active form of NS3 in vitro is an oligomer, thereby assuring that multiple molecules of NS3 are bound to each DNA substrate. This conclusion does not exclude the possibility that the monomeric or dimeric forms are completely inactive. “Burst Kinetics” Are Observed When NS3 Is Similar to the Substrate Concentration—To further examine the apparent burst amplitudes indicated in Fig. 2, rapid mixing experiments were performed with 100 nm substrate and increasing concentrations of NS3. The results indicate that rapid unwinding does occur under these conditions, resulting in a low but measurable quantity of ssDNA. NS3 (100 nm) unwound the DNA (100 nm) with a burst amplitude of ∼7.5 nm (Fig. 3 and Table 1), consistent with the results from Fig. 2. Increasing NS3 concentration up to 400 nm resulted in a linear increase in the burst amplitude (Fig. 3B). The linear increase in amplitude as a function of NS3 concentration indicates that the enzyme species that unwinds the substrate has similar activity over the concentration range being examined (50–400 nm). It might be expected that an oligomeric form of NS3 would exhibit a sigmoidal increase in activity with increasing enzyme concentration if an oligomer is the optimally active species. However, it is possible that some oligomerization occurs at NS3 concentrations lower than 50 nm. We turned to biochemical and biophysical approaches to investigate the oligomeric nature of NS3.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for DNA unwinding under presteady state conditions DNA (100 nm, 15-nt/30-bp partial duplex) was incubated with NS3 (50–400 nm), followed by rapid mixing with ATP and Mg2+ at 37 °C.

In this report we show that there are at least two different pathways to transcriptional repression, depending on the type of DNA damage. After H2O2 treatment, transcription was rapidly inhibited and rapidly restored. On the other hand, UV irradiation caused a much slower transcriptional inhibition, with a corresponding depletion of unphosphorylated RNAPII. We found that after UV treatment, but not treatment with H2O2, the inhibition of transcription was dependent on both the proteasome and new protein synthesis. In addition, RNAPII activity and ubiquitination were regulated through the phosphorylation of RNAPII by the P-TEFb kinase. These results highlight that multiple cellular pathways exist to globally repress transcriptional processes that might interfere with the repair of DNA damage."

Externalization of PS is a marker of apoptosis, exocytosis, and some nonapoptotic activation events. It has been proposed that PS externalization is regulated by the activity of PLSCR1 (phospholipid scramblase 1), a Ca2+-dependent endofacial plasma membrane protein, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated in activated cells. It is, however, unclear how the phosphorylation of PLSCR1 is related to its membrane topography, PS externalization, and exocytosis. Using rat basophilic leukemia cells as a model, we show that nonapoptotic PS externalization induced through the high affinity IgE receptor (FcϵRI) or the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein Thy-1 does not correlate with enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLSCR1. In addition, PS externalization in FcϵRI- or Thy-1-activated cells is not associated with alterations of PLSCR1 fine topography as detected by electron microscopy on isolated plasma membrane sheets. In contrast, activation by calcium ionophore A23187 induces changes in the cellular distribution of PLSCR1. We also show for the first time that in pervanadate-activated cells, exocytosis occurs even in the absence of PS externalization. Finally, we document here that tyrosine-phosphorylated PLSCR1 is preferentially located in detergent-insoluble membranes, suggesting its involvement in the formation of membrane-bound signaling assemblies.

The finding that aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor (FcϵRI) in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells leads to a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of PLSCR1 (22Pastorelli C. Veiga J. Charles N.

It was, however, unclear whether tyrosine phosphorylation of PLSCR1 in mast cells is confined to FcϵRI triggering and in what way it is related to PS externalization and exocytosis observed in activated mast cells. To address these issues, we studied the interrelationships among tyrosine phosphorylation of PLSCR1 and its plasma membrane topography, PS externalization, and degranulation in RBL cells triggered by various stimuli known to have different effects on protein tyrosine phosphorylation, [Ca2+]i, and exocytosis. Our data indicate that the above events are independent phenomena, which can occur individually, depending on the activation methods employed. Antibodies and Reagents—The following antibodies were used: MRCOX7 monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for Thy-1.1 (αThy-1) (32Mason D.W. Williams A.F. Biochem.

PLSCR1-specific rabbit pAb (RαPLS) was prepared by immunizing rabbits with recombinant PLSCR1. Phosphotyrosine-specific mAb, clone PY20 (αPY), conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, was purchased from BD Biosciences. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated GαM IgG and horseradish peroxidasee-conjugated GαR IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Donkey anti-rabbit (DαR) IgG-cyanine 3 (Cy3) conjugate was bought from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Mouse mAb 129.2 specific for PLSCR1 (MαPLS*) was kindly provided by M. Benhamou (INSERM, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was from BD Biosciences. Latrunculin B, EGTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, calcium ionophore A23187, and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Production of New mAb against Plasma Membrane Microdomains and Identification of Their Target Antigens—RBL cells were lysed in ice-cold 1% Brij 96-containing lysis buffer (38Surviladze Z. Dráberová L. Kovářová M. Boubelík M. Dráber P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The lysate was subjected to fractionation on a sucrose density gradient, as described previously (38Surviladze Z. Dráberová L. Kovářová M. Boubelík M. Dráber P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and low density fraction, containing detergent-insoluble membranes (DIM), were pooled and used for immunization of BALB/c mice. Hybridoma cells were obtained after fusion of SPO2 mouse myeloma cells with spleen cells of immunized mice using standard procedures (39Dráber P. Zikán J. Vojtíšková M. J. Immunogenet. 1980; 7: 455-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The target antigens of the new mAb were immunoprecipitated from the lysate of resting RBL cells and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Alignment of immunoblotted and colloid silver-stained membranes allowed identification of silver-stained proteins corresponding to the target antigens. The corresponding in-gel silver-stained proteins were excised and destained as described previously (40Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The proteins were digested by trypsin and analyzed by peptide mass mapping and/or peptide sequencing (41Bobek J. Halada P. Angelis J. Vohradský J. Mikulík K. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 3864-3880Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Data base searches of the identified peptide fragments allowed determination of the target antigens. DNA Constructs, Recombinant Proteins, and Immunoaffinity Purification of pAb—To prepare the N-terminal fragment of recombinant PLSCR1, full-length cDNA of rat PLSCR1 without initial ATG codon was amplified and cloned into XmaI and HindIII cloning sites of pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) using the forward (5′-AAACCCGGGGAGAAGCACGGACCACCAGAA-3′) and reverse (5′-CCCAAGCTTGCTACCATACTCCTGACCTTTG-3′) primers. A DNA fragment of the cloned cDNA was excised by SpHI and BamHI restriction enzymes and cloned into the corresponding sites in pQE70 expression vector (Qiagen). To prepare the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PLSCR1 fusion protein, full-length cDNA of rat PLSCR1 without the initial ATG codon was cloned into EcoRI site of pGEX-3X expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) using the following primers: forward, 5′-AAGGAATTCCGAGAAGCACGGACCACCAGAA-3′; reverse, 5′-AAAGAATTCCTACCATACTCCTGACCTTTG-3′. Recombinant proteins were expressed in bacteria Escherichia coli strain JM109. The N-terminal fragment of PLSCR1 was isolated from inclusion bodies as previously reported (42Konvalinka J. Heuser A.M. Hrušková-Heidingsfeldová O. Vogt V.M. Sedláček J. Štrop P. Kräusslich H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and used to immunize rabbits to generate RαPLS. The recombinant GST-PLSCR1 was affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The isolated GST-PLSCR1 or recombinant fragment of rat NTAL (37Dráberová L. Shaik G.M. Volná P. Heneberg P. Tůmová M. Lebduška P. Korb J. Dráber P. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 5169-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was covalently bound to CNBr-activated beads (Sigma), which were then used for immunoaffinity purification of PLSCR1- or NTAL-specific pAb (37Dráberová L. Shaik G.M. Volná P. Heneberg P. Tůmová M. Lebduška P. Korb J. Dráber P. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 5169-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In some experiments, isolated GST-PLSCR1 fusion protein was used at a concentration of 50 μg/ml to confirm the specificity of anti-PLSCR1 antibodies. Cells and Their Activation—The origin of RBL cells, clone 2H3, and their culture conditions have been described (43Siraganian R.P. McGivney A. Barsumian E.L. Crews F.T. Hirata F. Axelrod J. Fed. Proc. 1982; 41: 30-34PubMed Google Scholar, 44Dráberová L. Dráber P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 1583-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Before activation, cells were harvested and washed with buffered saline solution (BSS; 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose), supplemented with 1.8 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The cells were sensitized or not with TNP-specific IgE (IGEL b4 1 ascitic fluid diluted 1:1000 in BSS/BSA), αFcϵRI, or biotin-labeled αThy-1 (both at 2 μg/ml), washed, and resuspended in BSS/BSA to 20 × 106/ml. The cells were activated at 37 °C for the indicated time intervals by adding equal amounts of twice concentrated activators in BSS/BSA. Final concentrations of the activators were as follows: TNP-BSA (1 μg/ml), αFcϵRI or αThy-1 (2 μg/ml), streptavidin (10 μg/ml), calcium ionophore A23187 (3 μm), and pervanadate (0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm hydrogen peroxide). To induce apoptosis by UV irradiation, cells grown in medium were exposed in open Petri dishes to UV-C (predominantly 254 nm) from a germicidal lamp (Philips TUV G30T8 30-W bulb) at 60 cm distance. After a 10-min exposure, fresh medium was added, and the cells were cultured for further 6 h before analysis. Apoptosis was confirmed by proteolytic cleavage of Lyn (45Luciano F. Ricci J.E. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4935-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and DNA laddering as previously described (46Loo D.T. Rillema J.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 57: 251-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sucrose Density Gradient Fractionation—Cells were lysed in ice-cold Brij 58 lysis buffer (25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Brij 58, phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm Na3VO4 and 10 mm glycerolphosphate), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After 30 min, the lysate was subjected to fractionation on a sucrose density gradient (38Surviladze Z. Dráberová L. Kovářová M. Boubelík M. Dráber P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) supplemented with 2 mm Na3VO4 and 10 mm glycerolphosphate. Determination of Cell Degranulation and PS Externalization—Degranulation of the cells and PS externalization were assessed by the amount of released β-glucuronidase and bound FITC-labeled annexin V, respectively, as described (9Smrž D. Dráberová L. Dráber P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10487-10497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Silver Staining—Toward the end of the activation period, cells (107) were briefly centrifuged, and the pellet was lysed in ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm glycerol phosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After 20 min, the lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was further processed. To immunoprecipitate antigens recognized by mouse mAb, beads with covalently bound anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) were incubated with hybridoma supernatant for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer and incubated with cell lysate for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated antigen was eluted with glycine buffer (50 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, 100 mm NaCl). To immunoprecipitate PLSCR1, a 1-ml aliquot of the cell lysate was incubated with 15 μl of serum from PLSCR1-immunized rabbits for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with UltraLink-immobilized protein A (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C. Alternatively, 1 ml of the cell lysate was incubated with 10 μg of immunoaffinity-purified RαPLS or 2 μg of affinity-purified MαPLS*. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in reducing Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min. The samples were analyzed by immunoblotting of SDS-PAGE-fractionated proteins or by two-dimensional electrophoresis, as described previously (47Schraven B. Ratnofsky S. Gaumont Y. Lindegger H. Kirchgessner H. Bruyns E. Moebius U. Meuer S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed with 2 μg/ml purified antibodies, or 1:1000 diluted sera or ascitic fluids. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated αPY, GαM, or GαR IgG were diluted 1:10,000. Horseradish peroxidase-generated signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) on x-ray film and quantified by Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-3000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo). SDS-PAGE or two-dimensional fractionated proteins were visualized by in-gel silver staining using silver nitrate in combination with formaldehyde developer in alkaline carbonate buffer (48Patton W.F. J. Chromatogr. B. 2002; 771: 3-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 49Merril C.R. Goldman D. Sedman S.A. Ebert M.H. Science. 1981; 211: 1437-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar) or by membrane colloid silver staining (50Vettermann C. Jäck H.M. Mielenz D. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 308: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—Cells were spun down and resuspended in annexin V binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml. Forty μl of the cell suspension was mixed with 3 μl of annexin V-FITC and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. The cells were then transferred on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (12 mm in diameter) placed in wells of a 24-well plate. Five min later, the cells were fixed with 5% paraformaldehyde in annexin V binding buffer for 30 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline solution, pH 7.2 (PBS), and nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 10 min with PBS supplemented with 5% BSA (PBS/BSA; also used for dilution of antibodies). After a 5-min permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and washing, the cells were incubated for 20 min with PBS/BSA and then labeled for 1 h with immunoaffinity-purified RαPLS (5 μg/ml) or rabbit anti-LAT serum (diluted 1:1000), followed by washing with PBS, blocking for 20 min with PBS/BSA, and incubation for 1 h with DαR IgG-Cy3 conjugate (10 μg/ml). After another washing step, the cells were fixed for 10 min with 5% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed, and mounted in p-phenylenediamine (1 mg/ml, 50% glycerol in PBS). Images were acquired with a Leica TCS NT/SP confocal system in conjunction with Leica DMR microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with oil objective ×100/1.4 numerical aperture. Electron Microscopy—Plasma membrane sheets were prepared as described (51Sanan D.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 52Wilson B.S. Steinberg S.L. Liederman K. Pfeiffer J.R. Surviladze Z. Zhang J. Samelson L.E. Yang L. Kotula P.G. Oliver J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2580-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in complete culture medium were grown overnight on glass coverslips in the presence or absence of DNP-specific IgE (1 μg/ml). Adherent cells were activated or not by DNP-BSA (1 μg/ml) or other activators in BSS/BSA for the indicated time intervals at 37 °C, and the glass coverslips with cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and then inverted and briefly pressed onto pioloform-covered and poly-l-lysine-coated electron microscopy grids kept on ice; careful separation of coverslips from the grids leaves the plasma membrane sheets attached to the grids. The membranes were fixed immediately with 2% paraformaldehyde and then exposed to immunoaffinity-purified RαPLS (10 μg/ml), rabbit anti-NTAL pAb (10 μg/ml), or anti-FcϵRI-β mAb (3 μg/ml). Washed membranes were exposed to gold-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1:20 from commercial stocks. After additional fixation with 2% glutaraldehyde and staining with osmium tetroxide, tannic acid, and uranyl acetate, the samples were dried and examined under a JEOL JEM 1200EX electron microscope operating at 60 kV. To obtain membrane sheets from cells with aggregated Thy-1, the cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with αThy-1 (1 μg/ml), washed, and then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with GαM IgG-10-nm gold conjugate. In the case of Thy-1 labeling without aggregation, the cells were first fixed with paraformaldehyde and labeled for 15 min with αThy-1, followed by 10-min exposure to GαM IgG-10-nm gold conjugate. After the extracellular labeling, plasma membrane sheets were isolated as described above. Plasma membrane sheets from nonadherent apoptotic cells were prepared as described (53Lebduška P. Korb J. Tůmová M. Heneberg P. Dráber P. J. Immunol. Methods. 2007; 20: 139-151Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Evaluation of the Results—Means ± S.D. were computed from at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance of intergroup differences was calculated using an unpaired Student's t test; each group consisted of four independent experiments. Evaluation of gold particle co-localization was performed by bivariate Ripley's analysis (BRA) using the L(r)-r function as described (52Wilson B.S. Steinberg S.L. Liederman K. Pfeiffer J.R. Surviladze Z. Zhang J. Samelson L.E. Yang L. Kotula P.G. Oliver J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2580-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Pictures of plasma membrane sheets from two independent experiments were taken to cover ∼50 μm2 of plasma membrane surface and analyzed using Matlab software algorithms (52Wilson B.S. Steinberg S.L. Liederman K. Pfeiffer J.R. Surviladze Z. Zhang J. Samelson L.E. Yang L. Kotula P.G. Oliver J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2580-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Significant co-localization (p < 0.01) of the proteins occurred when the position of the L value curve (solid lines) surpassed the boundaries (dashed lines) predicted for random distribution of gold particles at a corresponding distance (Fig. 3, E and F and Fig. 5, D, and E). Cluster size was determined by the program GOLD (54Philimonenko A.A. Janáček J. Hozák P. J. Struct.

https://openalex.org/W1977296144,"Marked reduction in apoptosis is a hallmark of early colon tumour growth and the vast majority of these tumours exhibit a loss of expression of the glycoprotein carcinoembryonic-antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1). We recently reported that the CEACAM1 functions as a mediator of apoptosis implicating this cell surface protein in early tumour development. However, the mechanistic involvement of CEACAM1 in cell death pathways is unclear. Here, we show that apoptosis triggers cleavage of the long form of CEACAM1 (CEACAM1-4L) at intracellular and extracellular sites in Jurkat cells and HEK293 cells. Signalling through CEACAM1 leads to caspase activation including caspase-1 and -3 and also involves non-caspase proteases. Moreover, we provide evidence that the naturally occurring CEACAM family member CEA is an inducer of CEACAM1-mediated apoptosis in HT29 colon cancer cells, an effect that depends on the abundance of CEACAM1 on the cell surface. Together, our results demonstrate that the CEACAM1-dependent cell death pathway involves dual cleavage of CEACAM1 and caspase activation and can be activated by CEA."
https://openalex.org/W1998525570,"Physiological mineralization in growth plate cartilage is highly regulated and restricted to terminally differentiated chondrocytes. Because mineralization occurs in the extracellular matrix, we asked whether major extracellular matrix components (collagens) of growth plate cartilage are directly involved in regulating the mineralization process. Our findings show that types II and X collagen interacted with cell surface-expressed annexin V. These interactions led to a stimulation of annexin V-mediated Ca2+ influx resulting in an increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, and ultimately increased alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization of growth plate chondrocytes. Consequently, stimulation of these interactions (ascorbate to stimulate collagen synthesis, culturing cells on type II collagen-coated dishes, or overexpression of full-length annexin V) resulted in increase of [Ca2+]i, alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineralization of growth plate chondrocytes, whereas inhibition of these interactions (3,4-dehydro-l-proline to inhibit collagen secretion, K-201, a specific annexin channel blocker, overexpression of N terminus-deleted mutant annexin V that does not bind to type II collagen and shows reduced Ca2+ channel activities) decreased [Ca2+]i, alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineralization. In conclusion, the interactions between collagen and annexin V regulate mineralization of growth plate cartilage. Because annexin V is up-regulated during pathological mineralization events of articular cartilage, it is possible that these interactions also regulate pathological mineralization.

The extracellular matrix not only plays a major role in maintaining the function of a tissue but it also interacts and communicates directly with the cell via cell receptor/matrix interactions. These interactions play crucial roles in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Various types of collagens are the main organic components of extracellular matrices of many tissues. For example, in bone the main organic extracellular matrix component is type I collagen, whereas the main collagenous component in growth plate cartilage is type II collagen (1Hausler G. Helmreich M. Marlovits S. Egerbacher M. Calcif. Tiss. Inter. 2002; 71: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Type II collagen is highly expressed in the proliferative and prehypertrophic zones of growth plate cartilage. Just before mineralization starts, type II collagen synthesis is reduced and the hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes produce type X collagen (2Mwale F. Tchetina E. Wu C.W. Poole A.R. J.

Several cell surface receptors that mediate cell/matrix interactions have been identified in growth plate chondrocytes. Among these receptors are integrin receptors and non-integrin receptors, like annexin V and CD44. Several integrins have been identified to be expressed by growth plate chondrocytes. Among these integrins are α1, α2, α5, α6, αV, β1, and β5. Most of these integrins are expressed in all growth plate zones, whereas some integrins are restricted to certain zones. For example, β5 integrin is restricted to the hypertrophic zone (1Hausler G. Helmreich M. Marlovits S. Egerbacher M. Calcif. Tiss. Inter. 2002; 71: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Wang W. Kirsch T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30848-30856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The main collagen receptors in growth plate cartilage are α1β1 and α2β1 integrins (5Durr J. Goodman S. Potocnik A. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Annexin V was identified as another protein binding to types II and X collagen, and it has been demonstrated that chondrocytes attach to type II collagen using annexin V (6Reid D.L. Aydelotte M.B. Mollenhauer J. J. Orthop. Res. 2000; 18: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It was originally isolated from the chondrocyte membrane fractions as a type II collagen-binding protein (7Mollenhauer J. Bee J.A. Lizarbe M.A. von der Mark K. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1572-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8Kirsch T. Pfaeffle M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that annexin V, among other annexins, is highly expressed by hypertrophic and terminally differentiated growth plate chondrocytes (9Kirsch T. Swoboda B. Nah H.-D. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 294-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 10Mollenhauer J. Mok M.T. King K.B. Gupta M. Chubinskaya S. Koepp H. Cole A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Annexins are normally located in the cytoplasm or at the inner plasma membrane surface. However, several annexins have been detected extracellularly or surface-exposed. In addition, several annexins have been shown to act as receptors for a variety of molecules, including extracellular matrix proteins, fetuin A, vitamin D, and other cell surface receptors (11Chung C.Y. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 12Chen N.X. O'Neill K.D. Chen X. Duan D. Wang E. Sturek M.S. Edwards J.M. Moe S.M. Amer. J.

We provided evidence that annexin V mediates Ca2+ influx into growth plate chondrocytes and that this annexin-mediated Ca2+ influx regulates terminal differentiation and mineralization events (16Wang W. Kirsch T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Wang W. Xu J. Kirsch T. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 305: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, Ca2+ influx studies into liposomes have shown that binding of type II or type X collagen to annexin V stimulated its Ca2+ channel activities, resulting in an increased Ca2+ influx into liposomes (18Kirsch T. Harrison G. Golub E.E. Nah H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35577-35583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether collagen/annexin V interactions occur under physiological conditions and whether these interactions play a role in the differentiation events of growth plate chondrocytes. To determine whether collagen/annexin V interactions occur physiologically, we determined whether annexin V is surface-exposed on growth plate chondrocytes using flow cytometric analysis and whether cell surface-exposed annexin V interacts with type II or X collagen using co-immunoprecipitation analysis. To determine the function of collagen/annexin V interactions in growth plate chondrocytes, we interfered with collagen synthesis and secretion and annexin V expression and function (collagen binding abilities and channel function). We analyzed how these interferences affect cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, as a regulator of mineralization and terminal differentiation events (16Wang W. Kirsch T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (APase) 2The abbreviation used is: APase, alkaline phosphatase. 2The abbreviation used is: APase, alkaline phosphatase. activity, an enzyme required for mineralization, and the degree of mineralization of growth plate chondrocytes. Reagents—The preparation and specificity of rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for chicken annexin V were described previously (9Kirsch T. Swoboda B. Nah H.-D. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 294-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies specific for type II and type X collagen were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa, Iowa City) and have been described by Mills and Daniel (19Mills D.K. Daniel J.C. Connect. Tissue Res. 1993; 30: 37-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and Schmid and Linsenmayer (20Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for chicken β1 integrin were purchased from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). 3,4-Dehydro-l-proline and ascorbate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Native chicken type II collagen was obtained from Chondrex, Inc. (Redmond, WA). 1,4-Benzothiazepine derivative K-201 is cell-permeable and a specific annexin channel blocker and was obtained from Toshizo Tanaka, Japan Tobacco Inc., Osaka, Japan (21Kaneko N. Ago H. Matsuda R. Inagaki E. Miyano M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Fura-2 and fura-2AM were obtained from Molecular Probes/Invitrogen. Chondrocyte Culture—Chondrocytes were isolated from the hypertrophic zone of day 19 embryonic chick tibia growth plate cartilage as described previously (22Kirsch T. Nah H.D. Shapiro I.M. Pacifici M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 50 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) (complete medium) on tissue culture dishes or tissue culture dishes coated with type II collagen. For collagen coating, a 1:100 dilution of chicken type II collagen solution (Chondrex Inc.) was added to each well of 6-well tissue culture plates and incubated at 4 °C. After overnight incubations, excess solution was removed and freshly isolated chondrocytes were plated onto the collagen-coated wells. After cells reached confluency the various treatments were started. Cells were treated with 50 μg/ml ascorbate and 0.5 mm 3,4-dehydro-l-proline or 20 μm K-201 for various time points. The same concentrations of 3,4-dehydro-l-proline and K-201 were used in previous studies to inhibit collagen synthesis in fibroblasts, growth plate chondrocytes, and osteoblasts or annexin V channel activities in growth plate chondrocytes (16Wang W. Kirsch T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. Cui Y. J. Bone Miner.

These concentrations were shown not to be toxic to growth plate chondrocytes (16Wang W. Kirsch T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25Abe T. Abe Y. Aida Y. Hara Y. Maeda K. J. Cell Physiol. 2001; 189: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The medium was changed every other day. For annexin overexpression studies, growth plate chondrocytes were incubated after 3 days with high titer retroviral stocks of replication-competent, non-transforming Rous sarcoma virus-based expression vector (RCAS-BP) or RCAS-BP containing full-length annexin V or N terminus-deleted mutant annexin V cDNA in a small volume (5 × 106 colony-forming units/106 cells in less than 1 ml of medium) for 4 h. Thereafter, cells were cultured in complete medium in the presence of 50 μg/ml ascorbate for up to 8 days. The degree of overexpression was detected by immunoblotting using antibodies specific for annexin V or antibodies specific for c-Myc. The construction and production of chicken retrovirus RCAS-BP was performed as described previously (26Wang W. Xu J. Kirsch T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3762-3769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—Freshly isolated chondrocytes were cultured for 48 h and then trypsinized. After blocking with 4% heat-inactivated goat serum for 30 min, cells were stained with a rabbit anti-annexin V IgG and mouse anti-β1 integrin for 2 h on ice, followed by incubation with the respective secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 633 and Alexa Fluor 488; Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). A fluorescence-activated cell sorter (LSR1; BD Biosciences) was used to quantify bound antibody. Cytosolic Calcium Concentration [Ca2+]i Measurements—Chondrocytes were trypsinized, and then 2 × 106 cells were incubated with 4 μm fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) for 15 min at 37 °C. [Ca2+]i was measured as described previously (27Kirsch T. Swoboda B. von der Mark K. Differentiation. 1992; 52: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4. This suspension was transferred into a cuvette (magnetically stirred and thermostated at 37 °C). Fluorescence was measured in a fluorimeter (Photon Technology; excitation and emission wavelengths were 340 and 505 nm, respectively). The fluorescence maximum (FMax) was determined by addition of ionomycin (2 pmol/liter; Calbiochem), and the fluorescence minimum (FMin) was determined in the presence of 1 mm EGTA/10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. [Ca2+]i was calculated according to the following equation: [Ca2+]i = Kd × [(F – FMin)/(FMax – F)], with Kd = 224 nm (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Measurement of APase Activity and Protein Content and Alizarin Red S Staining—APase activity was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) as a substrate as described previously (16Wang W. Kirsch T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Protein content was analyzed by the BCA protein assay from Pierce. To determine the degree of mineralization, chondrocytes were stained with alizarin red S as described previously (16Wang W. Kirsch T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To quantify the alizarin red S staining, alizarin red S-stained cultures were incubated with 100 mm cetylpyridinium chloride for 1 h to release calcium-bound alizarin red S into solution. The absorbance of the released alizarin red S staining was measured at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer. Data were expressed as units of alizarin red S released/mg of protein in each culture. Immunoprecipitation—Growth plate chondrocytes were cultured for 48 h in the presence of 50 μg/ml ascorbate. Cells were then extracted with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and proteinase inhibitor mixture. 1 mg of total protein from the cell extract was incubated with 3 μg of monoclonal mouse anti-chicken type II or chicken type X collagen IgG fractions for overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, 60 μl of 50% slurry of protein A beads (Pharmacia) were added. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, beads were harvested and washed four times with extraction buffer. 50 μl of SDS loading buffer was added, and the samples were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. Supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Measurement of Ca2+ Influx into Fura-2-loaded Liposomes and Annexin V/Collagen Liposome Binding Studies—Large thin-walled liposomes containing phosphatidylserine and phosphatidyl-ethanolamine in a ratio of 9:1 were prepared using a dehydration/hydration method and were loaded with fura-2 as described previously (29Kirsch T. Nah H.-D. Demuth D.R. Harrison G. Golub E.E. Adams S.L. Pacifici M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3359-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Ca2+ influx into fura-2-loaded liposomes was measured in the absence or presence of recombinant full-length annexin V or N terminus-deleted mutant annexin V (200 nm) as described previously (29Kirsch T. Nah H.-D. Demuth D.R. Harrison G. Golub E.E. Adams S.L. Pacifici M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3359-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recombinant full-length and N terminus-deleted mutated annexin V were prepared using the pGEX expression vector (Pharmacia) as described previously (29Kirsch T. Nah H.-D. Demuth D.R. Harrison G. Golub E.E. Adams S.L. Pacifici M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3359-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To test the binding of type II or type X collagen to liposomes in the absence or presence of full-length annexin V or N terminus-deleted mutant annexin V, 200 nm of these annexins were incubated with liposomes in the presence of 400 μm Ca2+. Liposomes containing annexin or without annexin were then incubated with type II or type X collagen (10 μg) for 1 h at room temperature. Liposomes were quantitatively pelleted by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 15 min and washed twice, and aliquots of the liposome suspension were dotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunostained with antibodies specific for annexin V, type II collagen, or type X collagen as described previously (29Kirsch T. Nah H.-D. Demuth D.R. Harrison G. Golub E.E. Adams S.L. Pacifici M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3359-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The optical density of the color reaction was determined using a densitometer, and the optical density for staining of liposomes containing full-length annexin V and type II or type X collagen and immunostained with antibodies specific for type II or type X collagen was set as 1. Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) from Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the CCK-8 solution was added to each culture dish and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. After incubation the absorption was measured at 450 nm. The absorption value for the untreated cells was set as 100%. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—To determine the secretion and synthesis of types II and X collagen the cell layer was extracted with 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 m NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, including protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma-Aldrich and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell extracts (30 μg of total protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with primary antibodies specific for type II or type X collagen as described previously (16Wang W. Kirsch T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Numerical data are presented as means ± S.D. (n ≥ 3), and statistical significance between the groups was identified by using the two-tailed Student t test (p values are reported in the figure legends). To establish the role of the interactions between collagen and annexin V in terminal differentiation and mineralization events of growth plate chondrocytes, we treated chondrocytes isolated from the hypertrophic zone of day 19 embryonic chick tibia growth plate cartilage with ascorbate in the absence or presence of 3,4-dehydro-l-proline. Ascorbate is required for collagen synthesis, whereas 3,4-dehydro-l-proline reduces the hydroxylation of prolyl residues and the secretion of collagen from the cell (30Kerwar S.S. Felix A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 503-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used the same concentration of 3,4-dehydro-l-proline (0.5 mm) as used in previous studies to inhibit collagen synthesis in fibroblasts, sternal growth plate chondrocytes, and osteoblasts (24Sullivan T.A. Uschmann B. Hough R. Leboy P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22500-22506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Abe T. Abe Y. Aida Y. Hara Y. Maeda K. J. Cell Physiol. 2001; 189: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that a treatment over 6 days with 3,4-dehydro-l-proline in the absence or presence of ascorbate did not affect cell viability compared with the cell viability of untreated or ascorbate-treated cells. The amounts of type II and X collagen were markedly increased in cell extracts from ascorbate-treated growth plate chondrocytes compared with the amounts of these collagens in extracts from untreated cells (Fig. 1B, II, X). We only determined the amounts of collagens in cell and cell layer extracts and not the collagen amounts released in the medium because only the collagen remaining in the cell layer interacts with cell receptors, including annexin V. The expression of annexin V was not affected by the 72-h ascorbate treatment. 3,4-Dehydro-l-proline treatment did not affect annexin V expression in growth plate chondrocyte cultures in the absence or presence of ascorbate (Fig. 1B, AnV). 3,4-Dehydro-l-proline, however, markedly reduced the amounts of types II and X collagen in total cell extracts from ascorbate-treated growth plate chondrocytes (Fig. 1B, II, X). To determine whether types II and X collagen, which bind to annexin V and stimulate its Ca2+ channel activities in an artificial liposome system (18Kirsch T. Harrison G. Golub E.E. Nah H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35577-35583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), affect annexin Ca2+ channel activities and ultimately mineralization events in growth plate chondrocytes, we determined first whether the inhibition of collagen secretion by 3,4-dehydro-l-proline in ascorbate-treated growth plate chondrocytes affected their [Ca2+]i and their degree of mineralization. Ascorbate increased [Ca2+]i compared with [Ca2+]i of untreated growth plate chondrocytes (Fig. 2A). 3,4-Dehydro-l-proline (0.5 mm) led to a decrease of [Ca2+]i in ascorbate-treated cultures to levels similar to those of untreated cells (Fig. 2A). 3,4-Dehydro-l-proline led to a slight, but statistically not significant, increase of [Ca2+]i compared with the levels of untreated cells (Fig. 2A). Ascorbate treatment resulted in a marked increase of APase activity and degree of mineralization compared with the levels of APase activity and mineralization in untreated cultures, which showed only very little signs of mineralization (Fig. 2, B–D). APase activity was measured in cell extracts, because most APase activity is retained on either the outer cell surface or in matrix vesicles, which are present in the cell layer (22Kirsch T. Nah H.D. Shapiro I.M. Pacifici M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). APase activity was decreased in ascorbate-treated and untreated growth plate chondrocyte cultures in the presence of 3,4-dehydro-l-proline (Fig. 2B). 3,4-Dehydro-l-proline also resulted in a notable decrease of mineralization of ascorbate-treated growth plate chondrocyte cultures (Fig. 2, C and D). These findings reveal that interfering with collagen secretion by 3,4-dehydro-l-proline affects [Ca2+]i, APase activity, and the degree of mineralization in ascorbate-treated growth plate chondrocytes. To further determine whether collagen/annexin V interactions mediate these effects, we determined whether annexin V is cell surface-expressed and interacts with types II and X collagen on the cell surface. Annexins are cytosolic proteins, which have no signal peptide for protein secretion. However, several studies have shown the secretion of annexins to the cell surface (14Siever D.A. Erickson H.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 32Castro-Caldas M. Duarte C.B. Carvalho A.P. Lopes M.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 237: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis of growth plate chondrocytes revealed that the cells express β1 integrin (Fig. 3A, c: lower and upper right quadrants) and annexin V (c: upper left and upper right quadrants) on their surface. Furthermore, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in which total cell extracts from growth plate chondrocytes treated for 48 h with ascorbate were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for type II or type X collagen and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for annexin V. Annexin V co-immunoprecipitated with type II collagen or type X collagen as shown by the immunoblot of type II collagen or type X collagen immunoprecipitates with antibodies specific for annexin V (Fig. 3B). Immunoblotting of the type II collagen immunoprecipitate with antibodies specific for type II collagen revealed a band for type II collagen, whereas immunoblotting of the type X collagen immunoprecipitate with antibodies specific for type X collagen revealed a band for type X collagen (Fig. 3B). These findings reveal that type II and type X collagens interact with cell surface-exposed annexin V. To further establish the role of collagen/annexin V interactions in growth plate chondrocyte mineralization, we cultured growth plate chondrocytes on tissue culture dishes or type II collagen-coated tissue culture dishes in the absence or presence of K-201, a specific annexin V Ca2+ channel blocker (33Kaneko N. Matsuda R. Toda M. Shimamoto K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1330: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). K-201 was used in a concentration of 20 μm, which has been previously shown to be an effective concentration to inhibit annexin VCa2+ channel activities without affecting cell viability (16Wang W. Kirsch T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cells cultured on type II collagen-coated dishes showed an increase of [Ca2+]i compared with [Ca2+]i of growth plate chondrocytes cultured on tissue culture dishes (Fig. 4A). APase activity and the degree of mineralization were also stimulated by culturing growth plate chondrocytes on type II collagen-coated dishes compared with the APase activity and degree of mineralization of cells cultured on tissue culture dishes (Fig. 4, B and C). The increase of [Ca2+]i, APase activity, and the degree of mineralization of growth plate chondrocytes cultured on type II collagen-coated dishes was inhibited by K-201 (Fig. 4, A–C). K-201 treatment had no effect on [Ca2+]i, APase activity, and mineralization of growth plate chondrocytes cultured on tissue culture dishes (Fig. 4, A–C). In the final set of experiments we determined whether a N terminus-deleted mutant annexin V, which has been previously shown to have reduced Ca2+ channel activities compared with full-length annexin V (34Berendes R. Burger A. Voges D. Demange P. Huber R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), had an effect on APase activity and the degree of mineralization of ascorbate-treated growth plate chondrocytes cultures. We prepared full-length annexin V (amino acids 1–321) and N terminus-deleted mutant annexin V (amino acids 13–321) using the pGEX expression vector as described previously (29Kirsch T. Nah H.-D. Demuth D.R. Harrison G. Golub E.E. Adams S.L. Pacifici M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3359-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We determined whether full-length or N terminus-deleted mutant annexin V mediates Ca2+ influx into fura-2-loaded phosphatidylserine-enriched liposomes. The N terminus-deleted mutant annexin V mediated Ca2+ influx into liposomes to a lesser degree than full-length annexin V (Fig. 5A). Next we tested whether binding of type II or X collagen to liposomes is affected by the N-terminal domain of annexin V. Liposomes were incubated with type II or X collagen in the absence or presence of full-length annexin V or N terminus-deleted mutant annexin V, and liposome-bound type II or X collagen was detected with antibodies specific for type II or type X collagen. In the absence of annexin V, native type II or type X collagen did not bind t"

Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) 4The abbreviations used are: TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; CDDO, 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid; CDDO-Im, CDDO-imidazolide; CDDO-biotin, biotinylated CDDO; EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal transition; TβRI and TβRII, TGFβ Ser/Thr kinase type I and II membrane receptor, respectively; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DIC, differential interference contrast. family members regulate many cellular functions, including proliferation and differentiation, and TGFβ is a potent apoptotic agent in many cells, including early stage epithelial tumors (1Pardali K. Moustakas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1775: 21-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). However, in late stage epithelial tumors, TGFβ becomes a metastatic agent and stimulates epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration (2Bose R. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 3Muraoka R.S. Dumont N. Ritter C.A. Dugger T.C. Brantley D.M. Chen J. Easterly E. Roebuck L.R. Ryan S. Gotwals P.J.

Signaling by TGFβ growth factor is initiated via ligand-induced heteromeric complex formation of the Ser/Thr kinase type I (TβRI) and type II (TβRII) transmembrane receptors (6Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smad proteins R-Smad2 and R-Smad3 is facilitated by Smad anchor for receptor activation protein, which binds the receptors and recruits R-Smad to the membrane of EEA1-positive early endosomes (7Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Early endosomes also contain other modulators of TGFβ receptor signaling, such as hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (8Miura S. Takeshita T. Asao H. Kimura Y. Murata K. Sasaki Y. Hanai J.I. Beppu H. Tsukazaki T. Wrana J.L. Miyazono K. Sugamura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9346-9355Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and cytoplasmic promyelocytic leukemia protein (9Lin H.K. Bergmann S. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2004; 431: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the TGFβ signaling pathway is carried out by several mechanisms. Phosphorylated Smad2 is targeted by the nuclear phosphatase PPM1A (10Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H. Long J. Hu M. Davis C.M. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Feng X.H. Cell. 2006; 125: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and the receptors are the target of inhibitory Smad7, which interacts with TβRI in lipid rafts/caveolae and recruits the E3 ligases, Smurf1 and Smurf2, which direct ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the TGFβ receptors (11Ebisawa T.

Perturbation of lipid rafts increases signaling and reduces the rate of receptor degradation (14Chen C.L. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol.

Thus, the signal transduction pathway initiated by cell surface TGFβ receptor complex is dependent on receptor internalization and trafficking via distinct endocytic pathways (19Le Roy C. Wrana J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of cell surface proteins is dependent on the microtubule cytoskeleton (20D'Arrigo A. Bucci C.

Cell. 2004; 15: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Microtubules are dynamic protein filaments that span the cell interior and provide a mechanical framework for chromosome sorting, cell polarity, and organelle localization, among other functions (23Burkhardt J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 24Galjart N. Perez F. Curr. Opin.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Microtubules grow and shrink from their plus-ends, and their minus-ends are usually located at the microtubule-organizing center but are also found at the apical domain in epithelial cells (29Pearson C.G. Bloom K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Polarized migration of cells as well as the movement of vesicles along the microtubules is dependent on molecular motors and microtubule-binding proteins, such as the capping protein, Clip-170 (30Goode B.L. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 31Perez F. Diamantopoulos G.S. Stalder R. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 517-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the association of microtubule-bound Clip-170 at the cell membrane with the Rac1/Cdc42-binding protein, IQGAP1, is an essential mediator between microtubules and the leading edge of migrating cells (32Fukata M. Watanabe T. Noritake J. Nakagawa M. Yamaga M. Kuroda S. Matsuura Y. Iwamatsu A. Perez F. Kaibuchi K.

Kaibuchi K. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 871-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Cdc42 also binds to the Par6-PKCζ polarity complex, which in turn links Cdc42 to APC and the microtubule network to form a focal point for directional cellular movement (26Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). These molecular links, in combination with the observation that Par6 associates with TGFβ receptors (34Ozdamar B. Bose R. Barrios-Rodiles M. Wang H.R. Zhang Y. Wrana J.L. Science. 2005; 307: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), have introduced a new area of study to the field of TGFβ-dependent signaling in cell migration and metastasis (2Bose R. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Chemotherapeutic agents that block TGFβ-dependent signaling and TGFβ-dependent metastasis have been a major focus in cancer chemotherapy (35Yingling J.M. Blanchard K.L. Sawyer J.S. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Recently, 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO), has been shown to be a promising cancer therapeutic agent that is currently in Phase I clinical trials (36Liby K.T. Yore M.M. Sporn M.B. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both CDDO and its imidazolide derivative, CDDO-Im, have been shown to synergistically increase cellular responses to factors such as TGFβ in cell culture studies (37Ji Y. Lee H.J. Goodman C. Uskokovic M. Liby K. Sporn M. Suh N. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 1452-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 38Mix K.S. Coon C.I. Rosen E.D. Suh N. Sporn M.B. Brinckerhoff C.E.

Honda T. Gribble G.W. Sporn M.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1371-1376PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby CDDO-Im does this has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that CDDO-Im alters TGFβ cell signaling and receptor trafficking and inhibits cell migration by disrupting cytoskeletal attachments to the polarity complex. Mv1Lu cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids. Mv1Lu cells stably transfected with the HA epitope-tagged TGFβ type II receptor (HAT cells) were cultured in minimal essential medium plus 1% nonessential amino acids and 0.3 mg/ml hygromycin. COS-7, C2C12, HEK293, and Rat2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum unless otherwise stated. Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin, anti-caveolin-1 (610059), anti-EEA1 (610456), anti-Rac1 (610650), anti-GM130 (610822), anti-Smad2 (610842), and anti-LAMP1 (555798) antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Mississauga, Canada). Monoclonal anti-tubulin (Tub2.1), anti-FLAG (M2), and polyclonal anti-actin (A2668) antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-PKCζ (C-20), anti-TGFβ type II receptor (C-16), anti-Par6 (H-90), anti-IQGAP1 (H-109), anti-HA (Y-11), and goat anti-lamin A/C antibodies (sc-6215) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-Smad2 (AB3849) antibodies were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The polyclonal phospho-Par6 (Ser-345) antibody was used as previously described (34Ozdamar B. Bose R. Barrios-Rodiles M. Wang H.R. Zhang Y. Wrana J.L. Science. 2005; 307: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-Clip-170 (N-terminal) antibody was a generous gift from Dr. K. Kaibuchi (Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan), and the polyclonal anti-calnexin was kindly provided by Dr. J. J. M. Bergeron and P. H. Cameron (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). The GFP-tagged Clip-170 construct was a generous gift from Dr. F. Perez (CNRS, Paris, France). Cells were preincubated in control media or media containing 1 μm CDDO-Im for 1 h at 37 °C, placed on ice, and incubated with 250 pm 125I-TGFβ in KRH plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 2 h. Following cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate, cells were lysed (time 0) or incubated at 37 °C for 2, 4, or 8 h prior to lysis. Receptors were visualized by SDS-PAGE and quantified using PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Cytoskeleton—Fractions containing the cytoskeleton were separated from those containing detergent-solubilized membranes and cytosol by the method described by Contin et al. (40Contin M.A. Sironi J.J. Barra H.S. Arce C.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 463-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells were incubated for 3 h in control medium or media containing 10 μm nocodazole or 1 μm CDDO-Im and then rinsed with microtubule stabilization buffer (90 mm Mes (pH 6.7), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol) that had been preheated to 37 °C. Cells were then lysed with microtubule stabilization buffer containing 10 μm placitaxel (Sigma), 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors for 4 min at 37 °C. The solubilized fractions were then collected. To collect the remaining cellular structures containing the cytoskeleton, SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the culture dishes. Following scraping and passaging through a syringe, the fractions containing the cytoskeleton were collected. To analyze the partitioning of cytoskeletal proteins, fractions containing the soluble proteins or the cytoskeleton were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Rac1, anti-tubulin, anti-actin, anti-IQGAP1, anti-EEA1, anti-calnexin, anti-LAMP1, anti-GM130, or anti-Clip-170 antibodies. Nuclear Fractionation—To quantify the amount of Smad2 present in the nucleus in the presence of CDDO-Im, subcellular fractionation was carried out as described by Cong and Varmus (41Cong F. Varmus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 0.5 mm TGFβ for 30 min in the absence or presence of 1 μm CDDO-Im, washed, and incubated in media containing Me2SO (control), 1 μm CDDO-Im, 10 μm SB431542, or both compounds (CDDO-Im + SB431542) at 37 °C for an additional 1 or 4 h. The cells were then scraped into ice-cold PBS and collected by centrifugation at 1000 × gav for 5 min. The cells were then washed once again with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4). After a 5-min incubation on ice, cells were homogenized with 50 strokes using a Dounce homogenizer. Cells were then centrifuged at 1000 × gav for 5 min. The pellets were washed twice with hypotonic buffer and resuspended in nuclear isolation buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 300 mm sucrose, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The pellets in the nuclear isolation buffer were then further homogenized 50 times using a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 1000 × gav for 5 min. The nuclear pellet was resuspended with nuclear isolation buffer with 1% Triton X-100 to generate the nuclear fraction. The nuclear fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with mouse anti-Smad2 or goat anti-lamin A/C antibodies. The levels of Smad2 were quantitated using QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad) and normalized to the amount of lamin A/C in each fraction. Phospho-Smad2 Time Course—Cells were incubated with 0.5 mm TGFβ for 30 min, in the absence or presence of 1 μm CDDO-Im, washed, and incubated in media containing Me2SO (control), 1 μm CDDO-Im, 10 μm SB431542 (Sigma), or both compounds (CDDO-Im + SB431542) at 37 °C for an additional 1 or 4 h prior to lysis. Cell lysates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with mouse anti-Smad2 or rabbit anti-phospho-Smad2 antibodies. Quantitation of the amount of phosphorylated Smad2 was carried out using QuantityOne software and normalized to Smad2 levels. Smad2 Nuclear Accumulation—Cells were incubated with 0.5 mm TGFβ for 30 min in the absence or presence of 1 μm CDDO-Im, washed, and incubated in media containing Me2SO (control), 1 μm CDDO-Im, 10 μm SB431542, or both compounds (CDDO-Im + SB431542) at 37 °C for an additional 1, 4, or 8 h prior to fixation and permeabilization. Cells were then immunostained with anti-Smad2/3 antibody followed by Cy2-conjugated secondary antibody. DAPI staining was used to visualize cell nuclei. To quantify the amount of Smad2 nuclear localization, nuclear versus cytoplasmic intensity profiles were generated from individual cells using ImagePro software. The quantitation of ≥100 cells/condition from three experiments was graphed as the nuclear signal minus the cytoplasmic signal versus time ± S.D. Receptor Traffic—Receptor internalization studies were carried out as previously described (15Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Briefly, HAT cells expressing extracellularly HA-tagged TβRII receptors were incubated with biotinylated-TGFβ for 2 h at 4 °C, washed, and incubated with Cy3-streptavidin (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Cells were then washed and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with or without CDDO-Im. After the 37 °C incubation, cells were fixed and incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-EEA1 antibodies and rabbit polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibodies. Anti-EEA1 and anti-caveolin-1 were detected using anti-mouse Cy5-conjugated antibodies and anti-rabbit Cy2-conjugated antibodies (Jackson Laboratories Inc.), respectively. Acid washing was carried out as previously described (15Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Images were captured using an Olympus 1X81 inverted microscope equipped with fluorescence optics and deconvolved using ImagePro software. EEA1 Distribution—To visualize the effect of CDDO-Im on EEA1-positive endosomes, we assessed the staining pattern of the EEA1 compartment via immunofluorescence microscopy as described above with the exception that Cy2-labeled secondary antibodies were used. DAPI staining was used to visualize cell nuclei. Staining observed to be localized to an area no greater than one-half of the cell area and located more intensely on one side of the nucleus was scored as “perinuclear-positive.” If the intensity and distribution of the stain was equal throughout the cell body, it was scored as “dispersed.” The quantitation of ≥100 cells/condition from three experiments was graphed ± S.D. Cytoskeleton Studies—To visualize the effect of CDDO-Im on the microtubule cytoskeleton, cells were incubated for 1 h with or without 1 μm CDDO-Im or 10 μm nocodazole (Sigma) at 37 °C. Following fixation and permeabilization, cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. To assess the effect of CDDO-Im on the actin cytoskeleton, cells were incubated with 1 μm CDDO-Im or 10 μm cytochalasin B for 1 h prior to fixation and permeabilization. The cells were then incubated for 30 min with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin. Images were collected from a Leica DMIRE inverted microscope. Scratch Assay—Rat2 fibroblasts were grown to confluence, and the cell monolayer was scratched with a sterile pipette tip to create a “wound.” For bright field or DIC microscopy, images were collected using an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope. For immunofluorescence studies, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with anti-Clip-170, anti-tubulin, anti-Rac1, anti-TβRII, anti-IQGAP1, anti-Par6, or anti-PKCζ antibodies. Following fluorescently tagged secondary antibody incubation, the nuclei of cells were stained with DAPI, and cells were visualized using an Olympus IX81 microscope controlled by QED in vivo software (Olympus). The quantitation of the number of cells containing proteins at the leading edge of the cell was carried out using ≥100 cells/condition from three experiments ± S.D. Briefly, a cell containing a positive immunofluorescence signal only along the edge of the plasma membrane that was directly adjacent to the scratch was scored as positive for leading edge localization. If a cell contained no signal along the edge adjacent to the scratch or contained dispersed signal along the complete cell periphery, it was scored as negative for leading edge staining. Clip-170 Movies—Rat2 fibroblasts were microinjected with 0.25 nm cDNA encoding GFP-tagged Clip-170 protein and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The cells were then incubated in control medium or media containing 0.1 or 1 μm CDDO-Im. Expressed GFP-tagged Clip-170 was visualized by immunofluorescence, and time lapse images were collected using a Leica DMIRE inverted microscope utilizing Openlab 3.0 software. Cells were transfected with the constructs described in the figure legends using the calcium phosphate method as previously described (15Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and mixture of protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 15,000 × gav at 4 °C for 5 min. Aliquots of supernatants were collected for analysis of total protein concentration. The remaining cell lysates were incubated with primary antibody, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose. The precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Rat2 fibroblasts were grown to 100% confluence and scratched to create a wound. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 6 h to allow for the establishment of polarity. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with Rac1 antibodies followed by Cy2-labeled secondary antibodies. The cells were then incubated with 10 μm biotin, CDDO, or CDDO-biotin for 2 h, followed by incubation with Cy3-labeled streptavidin and DAPI. Cells were visualized using an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope. Protein concentrations of lysates were measured using the Lowry method (Fisher). The triterpenoid, CDDO-imidazolide (CDDO-Im) extends TGFβ signal transduction in several cell lines (37Ji Y. Lee H.J. Goodman C. Uskokovic M. Liby K. Sporn M. Suh N. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 1452-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 39Suh N. Roberts A.B. Birkey Reffey S. Miyazono K. Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Heiss E.H. Place A.E. Risingsong R. Williams C.R. Honda T. Gribble G.W. Sporn M.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1371-1376PubMed Google Scholar); however, the mechanism(s) and functional consequences have yet to be fully elucidated. In order to study the mechanism of how CDDO-Im extends TGFβ-dependent signaling, we first attempted to identify cell lines in which TGFβ-dependent Smad2 phosphorylation is transient. We treated various cell lines with a 30-min pulse of TGFβ and investigated the state of Smad2 phosphorylation by immunoblot analysis using a phospho-Smad2-specific antibody. We observed that the phosphorylation of Smad2 was transient in Rat2, COS-7, and C2C12 cells (≤4.5 h) whereas it was prolonged (>8 h) in HepG2 and HeLa cells (Fig. 1) (data not shown). In Rat2 and COS-7 cells, Smad2 phosphorylation was observed 30 min after TGFβ stimulation and attenuated over the remainder of the time course (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 1-4). In C2C12 cells, Smad2 phosphorylation returned to background levels within 1 h of ligand removal from the culture medium (Fig. 1C, lanes 1-4). Having observed transient Smad2 phosphorylation in Rat2, C2C12, and COS-7 cells, we next assessed the effect of co-incubating cells with TGFβ and CDDO-Im. We observed that CDDO-Im increased both the extent and duration of TGFβ-dependent Smad2 phosphorylation in all of the three cell types tested (Fig. 1, lanes 5-8). We next investigated if the effect of CDDO-Im on the duration of Smad2 phosphorylation could be due to an inhibition of Smad2 phosphatase activity. In order to test this, we employed one of the strategies used by Lin et al. (10Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H. Long J. Hu M. Davis C.M. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Feng X.H. Cell. 2006; 125: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) to identify PPM1A as the nuclear Smad2 phosphatase. Briefly, the TGFβ type I receptor inhibitor, SB431542, was added to the cell culture media after a preincubation of the cells with TGFβ. The addition of the inhibitor would allow assessment of whether TGFβ receptor activity would influence the effect of CDDO-Im on TGFβ-dependent Smad2 phosphorylation. In Rat2, COS-7, and C2C12 cells, the SB431542 inhibitor greatly reduced the phosphorylation of Smad2 within 1 h of incubation, indicating that these cell types have functional phosphatase activity (Fig. 1, lanes 9-12). We next assessed if CDDO-Im would influence Smad2 phosphatase by co-incubating cells with SB431542 and CDDO-Im. We observed that CDDO-Im did not extend TGFβ-dependent Smad2 phosphorylation in Rat2, COS-7, or C2C12 cells when SB431542 was present in the culture media (Fig. 1, lanes 13-16). These results suggest that the Smad2 phosphatase was not a CDDO-Im target, since CDDO-Im was unable to extend the duration of Smad2 phosphorylation after TGFβ receptor inactivation. As a second line of investigation, we assessed TGFβ-dependent Smad2 nuclear translocation using immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2). We found that in the absence of TGFβ, Smad2 staining was observed throughout the cytoplasm of C2C12 cells (Fig. 2A). After 1 h of TGFβ stimulation, Smad2 staining was only observed in the nuclei of cells regardless of treatment (Fig. 2, B-E, top panels). Eight hours after TGFβ was removed from the cell culture medium, Smad2 cytoplasmic staining reappeared in both control and CDDO-Im-treated cells (Fig. 2, B and C, bottom panels). Consistent with the phospho-Smad2 time course studies, the TGFβ type I receptor inhibitor, SB431542, increased cytoplasmic Smad2 staining after 8 h of incubation (Fig. 2D), and this was also observed if the cells were co-incubated with SB431542 and CDDO-Im (Fig. 2E). These results were supported by the quantitation of three experiments (Fig. 2F), and similar results were obtained with the use of Rat2 or COS-7 cells (data not shown). Finally, to further evaluate TGFβ-dependent nuclear accumulation of Smad2 in the presence or absence of CDDO-Im and/or SB431542, we carried out subcellular fractionation studies. We assessed TGFβ-dependent Smad2 nuclear accumulation by immunoblotting isolated nuclear fractions with anti-Smad2 antibodies (supplemental Fig. 1). In control cells, we observed Smad2 in the nuclear fractions after 0.5 h of TGFβ stimulation and the signal attenuated after 4.5 h of stimulation (supplemental Fig. 1, lanes 1-3). This was accentuated if the cells were incubated with CDDO-Im (supplemental Fig. 1, lanes 4-6). We observed that the TGFβ type I receptor inhibitor, SB431542, decreased the amount of Smad2 in the nuclear fractions after 4 h of incubation (supplemental Fig. 1, lanes 7-9), and this was also observed if the cells were co-incubated with SB431542 and CDDO-Im (supplemental Fig. 1, lanes 10-12). Taken together, these results support the conclusion that CDDO-Im increases TGFβ-dependent Smad2 phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation in a process that is independent of Smad2 phosphatase activity.

Inborn errors of glucose homeostasis and metabolism (1Sperling M.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have illuminated a vital link between a metabolic index, the ATP/ADP ratio, and cellular excitability that utilizes ABCC8(9)/KCNJ11(8)-encoded KATP channels as metabolic sensors (2Babenko A.P.

Res. 2001; 11: 1156-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar), SUR possess two non-equivalent nucleotide-binding domains, NBD1 and NBD2. Magnesium ·nucleotide-bound NBD1/NBD2 dimers counterbalance a magnesium-independent nucleotide inhibition of the KATP pore, an effect essentially saturated in intact cells by ATP present at >100 times the IC50(ATP) (5Babenko A.P.

Consistent with this mechanism, loss-of-stimulation mutations in NBD of SUR1 (ABCC8), the neuroendocrine-type receptor, have been discovered in infants with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (6Nichols C.G.

This study is the first analysis of permanent ND currents caused by a heterozygous mutation in a key TMD2-coding region of ABCC8, ABCC8Q1178R, found in a proband with normal KCNJ11 (8Christesen H.B.T. Sjoblad S. Brusgaard K. Papadopoulou D. Jacobsen B.B. Horm. Res. 2005; 64: 135Google Scholar). To understand how ABCC8Q1178R (NDSUR1) hyperactivate the heterozygous KATP ensemble, I used direct approaches, including recordings of single channels with the differentially restricted receptor composition, as well as structural modeling of the receptor core. The results reveal a novel mechanism of channelopathies, explain why the smallest subpopulation of hyperstimulated KATP channels can make a large contribution to the pathogenic conductance in heterozygous patients, and reveal that normal tolbutamide sensitivity of non-stimulated mutant SUR does not guarantee their normal response to the drug in physiologic MgATP. Mutagenesis, sequencing, cell culture and transfections were done as described previously (7Babenko A.P. Polak M. Cave H. Busiah K. Czernichow P. Scharfmann R. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. Vaxillaire M.

All the described mutations were introduced into hamster SUR1 cDNA (9Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J. P. t. Boyd III, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J.

The cDNA construct(s) were co-expressed in COSm6 cells with enhanced green fluorescent protein as described previously (7Babenko A.P. Polak M. Cave H. Busiah K. Czernichow P. Scharfmann R. Bryan J.

Patch clamp recording and current analysis was done as described previously (7Babenko A.P. Polak M. Cave H. Busiah K. Czernichow P. Scharfmann R. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. Vaxillaire M. Froguel P. N.

The bath Mg2+-free ([Mg2+]i < 0.1 nm) internal solution contained (in mm): 140 KCl; 5 EDTA; 5 HEPES; 10 KOH; pH 7.2 (KOH). The bath intracellular solution contained (in mm): 140 KCl; 1 MgCl2; 5 EGTA; 5 HEPES; 10 KOH; pH 7.2 (KOH). The [Mg2+]i in nucleotide-containing solutions was kept at ∼0.7 mm by adding MgCl2. The holding potential was –40 mV. COSm6 cells have negligible background currents, permitting measurements of virtually any low mean KATP currents, I. I analyzed the inwardly directed currents through <102 KATP channel-containing patches, allowing me to verify the unitary current amplitude, i, in cell-attached configuration from all-points current amplitude histograms and thus accurately determine the on-cell activity of n identical channels with the mean open probability Po, n × Po = I × i–1. The Colquhoun-Hawkes test was used to evaluate the channel singularity. The ligand-independent Pomax determined from single-channel currents and from macro-current noise were similar. The ligand responses of KATP currents were obtained using a programmed rapid solution changer. To correct the ATP dose responses for run-down and/or refreshment, the I value in the presence of each ATP concentration was normalized to the arithmetic mean of the I values before application of each [ATP] and after washout. Similar corrections were applied when estimating the relative steady-state activity in the presence of other ligands. The averaged values were expressed as mean ± S.E. for n ≥ 5; differences were evaluated using unpaired t test (p values are given in text or figure legends). Molecular modeling was done as described previously (10Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41577-41580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) using Sav1866 coordinates (11Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and the sequence alignment shown in supplemental Fig. S1. supplemental Fig. S2 shows a stereo view of the NDSUR1 core model. Fig. 1 shows that NDSUR1 hyperactivate normal KATP pores in the presence of millimolar MgATP in intact cells without changing their ligand-independent activity or apparent KD for inhibitory ATP. The effect of the mutation on the Po on-cell can be accounted for by its effect on the MgATP-dependent stimulatory action predicted to subsaturate at millimolar MgATP (5Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49083-49092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The ADP in human insulin-secreting β-cells is unlikely to rise above 0.5 mm, and the intracellular ATP in these and other mammalian cells is unlikely to drop below 0.5 mm (12Detimary P. Dejonghe S. Ling Z. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33905-33908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13Fridlyand L.E. Ma L. Philipson L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: E839-E848Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A, panel b, shows that in 0.5 mm MgATP + 0.5 mm MgADP, approximating severe catabolic conditions, the activity of the NDSUR1 channel is slightly higher than that of the WT channel. This implies that ADP makes a relatively small contribution to the hyperstimulation of NDSUR1 in vivo, where [ADP] should be lower and [ATP] + [ADP] > 1 mm, even in low glucose (12Detimary P. Dejonghe S. Ling Z. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33905-33908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13Fridlyand L.E. Ma L. Philipson L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: E839-E848Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the hyperglycemic NDSUR1 subject, the [ATP]/[ADP] ≫ 1. Therefore I determined the fraction of the maximal activity of the NDSUR1 versus WT channel in 1 mm MgATP + 0.1 mm MgADP and in 2 mm MgATP + 0.05 mm MgADP (0.159 ± 0.042 versus 0.035 ± 0.016 and 0.115 ± 0.033 versus 0.021 ± 0.007, respectively; n = 4 for each). The more significant (p < 0.005) effect of the mutation at these higher MgATP/ADP ratios indicates that the Q1178R markedly amplifies the stimulatory action of [MgATP] > 0.5 mm (see later). In 0.5 mm MgADP without ATP, or in 5 mm MgUDP, which subsaturates the stimulatory, but not adenine-selective, inhibitory sites (5Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49083-49092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), both channels display >90% of the ligand-independent activity, Pomax (three pairs of records not shown). Altogether, these observations argue that the hyperactivity of the NDSUR1 channel in physiological [ATP]/[ADP] is predominantly determined by MgATP, regardless of whether the magnesium ·nucleotide diphosphate-dependent stimulation of NDSUR1 is abnormal. ADP, normally a key regulator of the excitability of insulin-secreting cells (6Nichols C.G. Shyng S.L. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Clement J. P. t. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Permutt M.A. Bryan J. Science. 1996; 272: 1785-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), may not effectively control the basal KATP conductance in cells expressing NDSUR1/KIR6.2 channels as their hyperstimulation by submembrane MgATP ∼1–2 mm is sufficient to maintain large permanent hyperpolarizing currents. A much lower basal activity of KATP channels, ∼1% of their maximal activity (15Cook D.L. Satin L.S. Ashford M.L. Hales C.N. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), is essential for metabolic regulation of the β-cell excitability. Glucose metabolism-dependent increases in [ATP] and decreases in [ADP], which abolish this low basal activity of the WT KATP channels, may not be sufficient to nullify the NDSUR1 channel currents. Indeed these hyperpolarizing currents prevented excitation of insulin-secreting cells in vivo because the NDSUR1 patient responded to glibenclamide treatment (see also Ref. 7Babenko A.P. Polak M. Cave H. Busiah K. Czernichow P. Scharfmann R. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. Vaxillaire M. Froguel P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 456-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Thus the experimental and clinical observations argue that the MgATP-dependent hyperstimulation of mutant SUR can compromise the ability of KATP channels to couple the ATP/ADP ratio with cellular excitability in humans. NDSUR1 has normal NBD. So I proposed that the Arg-1178 stabilizes the normally occurring Mg2+ ·nucleotide-bound state of the ABCC8 core (supplemental Fig. S2) with either two ATPs or one ATP/one ADP bound at its NBD1/NBD2 dimer interface. The proposal is consistent with the non-equivalent nucleotide binding properties of the two domains (16Matsuo M. Tanabe K. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), similar ADP-bound versus AMP-PNP-bound conformers of Sav1866 with the closed NBD dimer and “outward-facing” (open) TMD (11Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 17Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar) and the maltose importer state with the similarly closed ATP-bound MalKE159Q dimer and open MalFG (18Oldham M.L. Khare D. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Nature. 2007; 450: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The proposal passed two complementary tests. First, as Mn2+ substitutes for Mg2+ in ATP-dependent stimulation of SUR (19Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dorschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5529-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), I verified that hyperstimulation is reproduced with Mn2+ in place of Mg2+; the fraction of the maximal activity of the NDSUR1 channel in 1 mm Mn-ATP was 0.141 ± 0.031 (n = 3). Second, K719R plus K1384R in the Walker A motifs eliminated the differences between the two channel activities on-cell and in 1 mm MgATP; the fractions of the Pomax were 0.003 ± 0.0012 and 0.0034 ± 0.0018 versus 0.0025 ± 0.001 and 0.0028 ± 0.0011 for NDSUR1K719R+K1384R versus SUR1K719R+K1384R channel, respectively (n = 3 for each). These activities match the activities of the NDSUR1 and SUR1 channels in 1 mm ATP without Mg2+ (Fig. 1A, panel b). Fig. 1A, panel b, also reveals that inhibition of the hyper-stimulated channels by tolbutamide is attenuated, whereas the same population of NDSUR1 channels under non-stimulatory conditions normally responds to the same drug. The IC50h = 1.8 ± 0.3 μm, hh = 1.01 ± 0.07, IC50l = 1305.5 ± 201.3 μm, hl = 1.09 ± 0.11 and L = 0.438 ± 0.017 describing the two-component tolbutamide dose response of the non-stimulated NDSUR1 channels were undistinguishable from the corresponding parameters for the WT channels under similar experimental conditions (14Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Consistent with the latter report and my model, I hypothesize that the Q1178R mutation reduces the ability of the sulfonylurea-binding TM domain to destabilize the magnesium ·nucleotide-bound state of the receptor. This is in line with several observations. (i) The ND mutation is within the TM15–16 segment of the TMD2, which specifies the stronger inhibition of SUR1-versus SUR2A-containing channels by tolbutamide (14Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Ashfield R. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft S.J. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). (ii) The coupling helix between TM15 and TM16 interacts with the canonical ATP-binding domain of the ABCC8 core (supplemental Fig. S2). (iii) The sulfonylurea binding releases ATP from ABCC8 and abolishes its stimulation (14Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Ueda K. Komine J. Matsuo M. Seino S. Amachi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To further examine the proposed mechanism of metabolism-excitation uncoupling, I obtained full ATP dose responses of the ND versus WT metabolic sensors with versus without physiologic [Mg2+]i and derived their apparent net stimulation curves. Essential for this analysis, my assay resolves very low activities of KATP channels in supramillimolar ATP. The results (Fig. 1B) show the following. (i) The ATP dose response of both WT and mutant channels, in intracellular concentrations of free Mg2+ (∼0.7 mm), deviates from an inhibitory Hill function when the concentration of ATP is greater than either the IC50(ATP) or the KD for the magnesium-independent binding of ATP at the first Walker A-based site (<10 μm (16Matsuo M. Tanabe K. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)). (ii) The deviation is greater for mutant channels in which the hyper-stimulating conformer is stabilized. (iii) The net stimulatory action of ATP, reflected by the ratio of the mean open channel probabilities in ATP with Mg2+ to ATP without Mg2+, is a sigmoidal (logistic) function, and C50 values for NDSUR1 and WT SUR1 are comparable with the apparent KD values for nucleotide binding, KD(ATP), (ADP), and KM for ATP hydrolysis at the lower affinity, second Walker A-based site of SUR1 and SUR1-KIR6.2 fusion (see Refs. 16Matsuo M.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4166-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, respectively, and note that all of the K values for the ABCC7 channel are also between 0.1 and 1 mm (23Rosenberg M.F.

Chem. 2004; 279: 39051-39057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas biochemical experiments on SUR1 indicate a very low, ADP-insensitive hydrolytic activity (16Matsuo M. Tanabe K. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24de Wet H. Mikhailov M.V. Fotinou C. Dreger M. Craig T.J. Venien-Bryan C. Ashcroft F.M. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 3532-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). (iv) The net stimulation saturates with a much higher maximum for the NDSUR1 channel. These findings reinforce the conclusion that the ND mutation in the TMD2 stabilizes the magnesium ·nucleotide-bound ABCC8 core whose lower affinity Walker A-based site specifies the stimulatory profile of the neuroendocrine-type metabolic sensors. The ND mutation exerts its pathogenic action in the heterozygous state. To deduce which species of the heterogeneous ND-KATP ensemble dominate the pathogenic conductance, one must determine the effectiveness of NDSUR1 in mixed KATP channels. I solved the problem using heteroconcatemers (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows an exponential dependence of channel hyperstimulation on NDSUR1 number. Macroscopic Imax from heterozygous, homozygous, and WT cells (10 for each) were similar, revealing no effect of the ND mutation on the density of KATP channels; the NHeterozygous/NWT and NHomozygous/NWT ratio was 0.97 ± 0.39 and 0.95 ± 0.36, respectively; thus channels with a different number of NDSUR1 should distribute binomially. In this case, the relative contribution of each channel species to the hyperconductance of cells expressing both ND and WT subunits is determined by the product of the exponential and binomial functions (Fig. 2C). The histogram shows that channels with three and four NDSUR1s, expected to comprise about one-third of a heterozygous population, generate ∼70% of the basal hyperconductance; (NDSUR1/KIR6.2)4 channels comprising only 6.25% of total n generate almost 30% of the pathogenic currents. Consistently, the heterozygous I × i–1 on-cell and in millimolar MgATP were between those for (NDSUR1/KIR6.2)4 and WT channels, e.g. 2.6 ± 0.5- and 2.7 ± 0.4-fold higher than the corresponding fractions of the n × Pomax for the WT channels (n = 5 for each). I conclude that tetradimeric channels with more than two NDSUR1 dominate the pathogenic conductance caused by the heterozygous mutation that stabilizes a Mg2+ ·nucleotide-bound conformer of the receptor. My findings (also see Ref. 7Babenko A.P. Polak M. Cave H. Busiah K. Czernichow P. Scharfmann R. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. Vaxillaire M. Froguel P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 456-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) suggest that magnesium ·nucleotide-dependent hyperstimulation of mutant KATP channels is a common pathogenic mechanism and that the measured on-cell fraction of the n × Pomax, not the IC50(ATP), for a recombinant mutant channel is the most universal and direct predictor of the severity of KATP channelopathies. A >2-fold overstimulation of KATP channels seems to be sufficient to uncouple excitability from the metabolic index in at least two human cell types with high input impedance, e.g. β-cells and neurons, thus illuminating the key role of cell type-specific regulators of ubiquitous KIRs in fine-tuning the Vm response to the tissue-specific dynamic metabolic rate. The regulatory signal (differential stimulation) is specified by the lower affinity, second Walker A-based site of ABCC8. The disease due to the gain in the ABCC8 response to physiologic [MgATP] implies that evolution has optimized SUR/KIR6 channels to monitor the submillimolar ADP at this lower affinity site of the NBD1/NBD2 dimer, positioned several nm away from the membrane phospholipids, when all of the other nucleotide-binding sites in the channel are essentially saturated by intracellular [ATP]. ATP-sensitive K+ pores themselves cannot function as sensors of the metabolic index. Nature created high fidelity, low noise metabolic sensors by coupling intrinsically low active weak inward rectifiers with ABC-based integral proteins that decrease the IC50(ATP) despite increasing the Pomax (25Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and are large enough to encircle and thus shield the KIR pore from promiscuous activators. The attenuated response of NDSUR1 channels to tolbutamide in the presence, but not absence, of MgATP is consistent with the proposed mechanism of hyperstimulation and reveals a potential overlooked mechanism of sulfonylurea tolerance, a compromised inhibition of receptor stimulation (14Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Predicting the effectiveness of the sulfonylurea treatment of ND requires testing recombinant ND channels at physiologic [MgATP]. The daily dose of tolbutamide (per kg of body weight) needed to transfer the NDSUR1 patient from insulin therapy to sulfonylurea treatment is predicted to exceed the currently recommended dose for treatment of type 2 diabetes. The exponential dependence in Fig. 2B is consistent with the view of KATP channels as concerted tetradimers (5Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49083-49092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and may close debates on the stoichiometry of KATP stimulation as four NDSUR1s with intact NBDs stimulate more than three NDSUR1 + one SUR1, in physiologic MgATP. Given a similar, exponential dependence of Pomax on the number of KIR6 subunits with a higher stability of the active state (5Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49083-49092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), I anticipate that 50% of the offspring of parents with mild diabetes or glucose intolerance secondary to heterozygous mutations in either ABCC8 and/or KCNJ11 may have severe neuroendocrine disorders.

We demonstrate such a method, which combines mass spectrometry with mild reductions, requires no prior experimentation or knowledge of proteins' physicochemical characteristics, function or activity, and is amenable to automation.

Targeted enzymes may evolve toward inhibitor resistance through selective incorporation of mutations. Acquisition of insensitivity may, however, result in profound devolution of native enzyme function and stability. We therefore investigated the consequential effects on native function and stability by evolving a cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) enzyme toward insensitivity to the small molecule inhibitor of the protein, acarbose. Error-prone PCR mutagenesis was applied to search the sequence space of CGTase for acarbose-insensitive variants. Our results show that all selected mutations were localized around the active site of the enzyme, and in particular, at the acceptor substrate binding sites, highlighting the regions importance in acarbose inhibition. Single mutations conferring increased resistance, K232E, F283L, and A230V, raised IC50 values for acarbose between 3,500- and 6,700-fold when compared with wild-type CGTase but at a significant cost to catalytic efficiency. In addition, the thermostability of these variants was significantly lowered. These results reveal not only the relative ease by which resistance may be acquired to small molecule inhibitors but also the considerable cost incurred to native enzyme function and stability, highlighting the subsequent constraints in the further evolutionary potential of inhibitor-resistant variants.

Many small molecule inhibitors play a central role in current treatment of human diseases, targeting an essential structure or process of the bacterium, virus, or host cell itself. Bactericidal antibiotics including aminoglycosides, macrolides, and tetracyclines are all potent inhibitors of bacterial protein synthesis (1Jana S. Deb J.K. Appl. Microbiol.

Numerous small molecule nucleoside and nucleotide inhibitor analogs have been synthesized to target the essential enzymes of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 2The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; BC251, B. circulans strain 251; CGTase, cyclodextrin glucanotransferase; epPCR, error-prone PCR; pNPG7, 0.05-3 mm 4-nitrophenyl-α-d-maltoheptaoside-4-6-O-ethylidene.

The powerful mitotic antitumor inhibitor, taxol, promotes the assembly and hyperstabilization of microtubules in the treatment of breast, lung, and ovarian cancers (8Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev.

A. 2003; 100: 6394-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, resistance to all of these effective inhibitors, due to intrinsic or acquired immunity, seems to be a mere formality (10Normark B.H. Normark S. J. Intern. Med. 2002; 252: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 11Andersson D.I. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The target cell may apply numerous counteractive measures to prevent the fatal actions of inhibitors. Multidrug efflux pumps are extremely effective in the removal of inhibitors from the cell in Gram-negative bacteria (12Poole K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Inhibitor modification by enzymes such as aminoglycoside acetyltransferases and phosphotransferases render aminoglycoside antibiotics ineffective (2Magnet S. Blanchard J.S. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 477-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Another form of resistance involves incorporation of single or multiple mutations at the target site of the inhibitors, ultimately leading to non-adherence and lack of inhibitor potency. Mutated variants must, however, preserve cell function while acquiring resistance. Studies of clinical isolates have shown that the biological cost of native enzyme function by the acquisition of antibiotic resistance is a main determinant of both the rate and the extent of resistance development under a given antibiotic pressure (11Andersson D.I. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Although compensatory mutations may aid in lowering this biological cost, there is ultimately a price to be paid in the initial acquisition of this newly attained function (13Gagneux S. Long C.D.

To investigate the delicate balance between this newly attained function and native function and stability, we have evolved a cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) enzyme toward resistance to the small molecule inhibitor of the protein, acarbose (Fig. 1). CGTase is a well studied model enzyme for the glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13) (16Stam M.R. Danchin E.G. Rancurel C. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Protein Eng. Des.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) catalyzing the formation of α-(1,4)-linked oligosaccharides (cyclodextrins) from starch (Fig. 1) and is strongly inhibited by the small molecule acarbose (19Leemhuis H. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Wehmeier U.F. Piepersberg W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 63: 613-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To evolve this enzyme toward acarbose insensitivity, we applied directed evolution, introducing random mutations throughout the cgt gene by error-prone (ep) PCR. CGTase variants were subsequently screened for native cyclodextrin-forming activity in the presence of high acarbose concentrations. Our results demonstrate the relative ease at attaining acarbose-resistant CGTase mutants, increasing the IC50 value for acarbose up to 6,700-fold. However, detailed analysis of the insensitive variants highlights the conflicting compromise between native and newly attained enzyme function and subsequent impact on protein stability. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli strain MC1061 was used for DNA manipulations and library screening. Plasmid-carrying strains were grown on LB medium at 37 °C in the presence of kanamycin (50 μg/ml for E. coli and 5 μg/ml for Bacillus subtilis). Bacillus circulans 251 (BC251) CGTase proteins were produced from plasmid pDP66k- using B. subtilis strain DB104A as host, as described (19Leemhuis H. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Purity and molecular weight were checked by SDS-PAGE. Enzyme concentrations were determined using the Bradford reagent from Bio-Rad (München, Germany) and bovine serum albumin as standard. Saturation and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutants were constructed in pDP66k- as described (21Leemhuis H. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and verified by DNA sequencing (BaseClear, Leiden, the Netherlands). Construction of the single mutants A230V, K232E, F283L, I61V, D313E, and D319E was carried out using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GC CTG CTT GAT TTA CGT TTT GC-′3 (F283L); 5′-TGG ATG CGG TG GAG CAT A-′3 (K232E); 5′-AC AAA GTC AAC GAC GG TTA C-′3 (I61V); 5′-TCC GCA GCC GAA TAC GCC CA-′3 (D313E); 5′-CGC ATG GAT GTG GTG AAG CAC ATG CCG TTC G-′3 (A230V); 5′-AT GAA CAG GTG ACG TTC ATC-′3 (D319E). The underlined regions of the oligonucleotides indicate where the nucleotide substitution was introduced. Double mutants H140Q/F283L, A230V/F283L, and A230V/H140Q were subsequently constructed using H140Q and A230V oligonucleotides with F283L and H140Q mutants as PCR template. His-140 was replaced by all 19 other amino acid residues by site-saturation mutagenesis, using the oligonucleotide: H140X, 5′-TTT GCC CCG AAC NNS ACG TC-′3. The underlined region indicates where the nucleotide substitutions were introduced. N is A+G+C+T, S is G+C, and X is any amino acid residue. Error-prone PCR Mutagenesis—The cgt gene was amplified from pDP66k- with the primers F1 (XhoI), 5′-GCG CCG GAT ACC TCG AGT TCC AAC AAG CAA AAT TTC-′3 and Rev1 (KpnI), 5′-CCA ATT CAC GTT AAT GGT ACC GGT GCC GCT GGA CGG-′3. The XhoI and KpnI restriction sites introduced (underlined) into pDP66k- resulted in V6S (N terminus) and A678G (C terminus) mutations, which had no effect on the catalytic properties of the enzyme (22Leemhuis H. Rozeboom H.J. Wilbrink M. Euverink G.-J.W. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7518-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). PCR mixtures (50 μl) contained: 1× TaqDNA polymerase buffer, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.25 mm MnCl2, 0.6 mm of each dNTP, 0.07 μm of each primer, 20 ng of pDP66k-, and 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). PCR reactions were performed for 25 cycles: 30 s 94 °C, 40 s 54 °C, and 2 min 72 °C. The PCR products were restricted with XhoI and KpnI, and the resulting fragment (2100 bp) was extracted from agarose gel (QIAquick gel extraction kit; Qiagen) and cloned in pDP66k-, replacing the wild-type cgt gene. Gene Shuffling—DNA shuffling of the single variants (A230V, F283L, K232E, H140Q) and wild-type BC251 cgt genes was carried out using an adapted version applied by Kikuchi et al. and Kaper et al. (23Kikuchi M. Ohnishi K. Harayama S. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 24Kaper T. Brouns S.J. Geerling A.C. De Vos W.M. Van Der O.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 461-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant genes were amplified using the flanking primers FLKF, 5′-GGA CAA GCC TGG AAT TCA-′3, and FLKR, 5′-CCG AAG CTT GCT CAA TCA-′3. PCR products were subsequently diluted to a concentration of 84 μg/ml before being pooled. Separate overnight restriction digestions of the pooled variants by MwoI, MspI, TaqI/EcoRII, NciI/Sau3AI, and HaeIII/NciI were followed by thermal enzyme inactivation. DNA fragments were reassembled in the following PCR cycles lacking primers: 96 °C, 90 s; 35 cycles of (94 °C, 30 s; 65 °C, 90 s; 62 °C, 90 s; 59 °C, 90 s; 56 °C, 90 s; 53 °C, 90 s; 50 °C, 90 s; 47 °C, 90 s; 44 °C, 90 s; 41 °C, 90 s; 72 °C, 4 min); 72 °C, 7 min; 4 °C 10 min. One μl of this reaction was used for generation of the full-length cgt gene by PCR using the F1 and Rev1 primers (mentioned above). The resulting full-length gene products were cloned into the expression vector to obtain the second generation library. Selection of Acarbose-insensitive CGTase Variants—E. coli MC1061 cells were transformed with the epPCR library and plated on LB agar plates. Resulting colonies were transferred to 200 μl of LB medium in 96-well microtiter plates using the Q-pix (Genetix, New Milton Hamsphire, UK) and incubation overnight (750 rpm) at 37 °C. From each well, 25 μl of culture was transferred to a second 96-well plate containing 25 μl/well of bacterial protein extraction reagent (Pierce) to lyse the cells. Subsequently, 200 μl of 1% (w/v) Paselli SA2 starch with 250 μm acarbose (Serva Electrophoresis, Heidelberg, Germany) in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) was added, and the microtiter plates were incubated at 50 °C for 5 h in an oven. Under these conditions, wild-type CGTase displayed no detectable cyclization activity. The amount of β-cyclodextrin formed was measured by the addition of 10 μl of the reaction to 100 μl of phenolphthalein solution before reading absorbance at 552 nm (25Vikmon, M. (1982) Rapid and Simple Spectrophotometric Method for Determination of Microamounts of Cyclodextrins (Szejlti, J., ed) pp. 69-74, Reidel Publishing Co, Dordrecht, The NetherlandsGoogle Scholar). Enzyme Assays—All CGTase enzyme assays (initial rates) were performed in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 60 °C. β-Cyclodextrin-forming activity was determined by incubating 1.3-66 nm of enzyme with a 2.5% (w/v) solution of partially hydrolyzed potato starch with an average degree of polymerization of 50 (Paselli SA2; AVEBE, Foxhol, The Netherlands). The amount of β-cyclodextrin produced was quantified with phenolphthalein (25Vikmon, M. (1982) Rapid and Simple Spectrophotometric Method for Determination of Microamounts of Cyclodextrins (Szejlti, J., ed) pp. 69-74, Reidel Publishing Co, Dordrecht, The NetherlandsGoogle Scholar). Inhibition by acarbose (IC50) was determined directly from the cyclization assay in the presence of 0.2-30,000 μm acarbose. The data were fitted to a four-parameter non-linear regression function using SigmaPlot 10 software (Systat). E=max+((min−max))/(1+C/IC50)k))+max,(Eq. 1) where min = minimum response, max = maximum response, C = acarbose concentration, IC50 = acarbose concentration causing half-maximum β-cyclization activity, and k = curve slope. Disproportionation activity was measured as described (19Leemhuis H. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), using 0.06-0.6 nm enzyme, 0.05-3 mm 4-nitrophenyl-α-d-maltoheptaoside-4-6-O-ethylidene (pNPG7; Megazyme, Wicklow, Ireland) as donor substrate, and 0.05-3 mm maltose as acceptor substrate. The 4-hydroxyl of the donor substrate pNPG7 is blocked, thereby preventing the donor substrate from being used as acceptor substrate. Fitness of epPCR Library—Competent E. coli MC1061 cells were transformed with the epPCR plasmid library, and the entire transformation (∼2 million transformants) was used to inoculate 2 liters of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Following overnight growth at 37 °C, cells were collected by centrifugation. Cells were broken by French press (10,000 p.s.i), and cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 15,000 × g. CGTase proteins were subsequently purified as described previously (22Leemhuis H. Rozeboom H.J. Wilbrink M. Euverink G.-J.W. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7518-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). High Pressure Liquid Chromatography Analysis—Formation of cyclodextrins from starch (10% (w/v) Paselli SA2 in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0) was analyzed by incubating the starch for 54 h with 13 nm wild-type and 65 nm mutant proteins (A230V, H140Q, K232E, F283L, and A230V/H140Q). Samples were taken at taken at regular time intervals and subsequently boiled for 30 min for enzyme inactivation. Products formed were analyzed on a homemade Benson BC calcium column (300 × 7.8 mm ID) at 90 °C connected to a refractive index detector. A mobile phase of 100 ppm Ca2+-EDTA in demineralized water at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min was used. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Thermal unfolding of (mutant) CGTases was measured using a MicroCal VP-DSC microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northhampton, MA) with a cell volume of 0.52 ml. Experiments were performed at a scan rate of 1 °C/min at a constant pressure of 2.75 bars. Samples were degassed prior to scan. The enzyme concentration used was 6.9 μm in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5 (26Leemhuis H. Rozeboom H.J. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. Proteins. 2004; 54: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Generation of Acarbose-insensitive Mutant CGTase Proteins—Random genetic diversity was created by error-prone PCR amplification of the cgt gene in the presence of 0.25 mm MnCl2. Under these conditions, 90% of the E. coli transformants retained starch-degrading activity as detected by the formation of halos surrounding the colonies on starch/agar plates. The fitness of the epPCR library was 60% regarding the initial β-cyclization activity, and the IC50 value for acarbose was 1.2 μm, nearly identical to that of the wild-type enzyme (Table 1). Twelve thousand variants of the library were screened for decreased inhibition by acarbose. Fifty-six variants retained β-cyclization activity in the presence of 250 μm of the acarbose inhibitor. Sequencing of 13 variants revealed the presence of A230V (9×), K232E (2×), and F283L (2×) mutations. Also, I61V, D313E, and D319E mutations were found, but only in combination with those mentioned. Construction and characterization of the purified proteins of the single mutations I61V, D313E, D319E, A230V, K232E, and F283L demonstrated that the A230V, K232E, and F283L mutations were responsible for CGTase insensitivity to acarbose inhibition (Table 1). Surprisingly, no His-140 mutant was identified from the screening as this histidine residue has been shown to be important for the strong inhibition by acarbose in Bacillus sp. 1011 and Thermoanaerobacterium thermosulfurigenes EM1 CGTases (27Nakamura A. Haga K. Yamane K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6624-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28Leemhuis H. Wehmeier U.F. Dijkhuizen L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13204-13213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). His-140 was therefore targeted by saturation mutagenesis. Screening of the 288 clones from the H140X library yielded six variants that formed β-cyclodextrins in the presence of 250 μm acarbose. Three of the clones were randomly picked and sequenced, revealing the His to Gln substitution in each case.TABLE 1Cyclization rates from starch and IC50 values for acarbose by wild-type and acarbose insensitive CGTase mutants from Bacillus circulans 251Enzymeβ-Cyclization kcatIC50-Fold increasea-Fold increase indicates the factor of improvement of variants compared to wild-type based on IC50 valuess–1μmWild-type329 ± 31.11EpPCR librarybMixture of mutant CGTases from the epPCR library195 ± 51.21.1A230V9 ± 0.17,3706,700H140Q79 ± 31,8071,642F283L35 ± 0.54,1973,815K232E26 ± 13,9303,572A230V/H140Q48 ± 21,8451,677a -Fold increase indicates the factor of improvement of variants compared to wild-type based on IC50 valuesb Mixture of mutant CGTases from the epPCR library Open table in a new tab Shuffling and Construction of Double Mutant CGTase Variants—In an effort to further decrease the inhibitory effects by acarbose, while retaining or increasing native β-cyclization activities, DNA shuffling of the selected variants from the error-prone library was carried out. Over 8,000 clones were screened at an increased concentration of 500 μm acarbose; however, no improved variants were found. To investigate whether combinations of mutations selected in the first round had additive effects for CGTase insensitivity toward acarbose, the double mutants A230V/F283L, A230V/H140Q, and F283L/H140Q were constructed. Only the A230V/H140Q mutant remained functional in β-cyclization production, with lower acarbose resistance levels when compared with the single mutants generated by epPCR (Table 1). This may explain the lack of identification of better performing mutants from shuffling. IC50 Values of Wild-type and Mutant CGTases—Measurement of β-cyclization activity in the presence of varying concentrations of acarbose revealed that mutations at the acceptor subsites of CGTase had a profound effect on inhibitor insensitivity, raising IC50 values by 3,500-6,700-fold when compared with wild type (Table 1). Mutation H140Q, located at the -1 donor subsite, had the least effect on inhibitor resistance, although still increasing the IC50 value over 1,600-fold when compared with wild type (Table 1). Catalytic Properties of Wild-type and Mutant CGTases—The β-cyclization rates of the selected mutations were compromised (Table 1). The F283L, K232E, and A230V/H140Q variants showed comparable decreases of ∼10-fold in the initial β-cyclization rates when compared with wild type, whereas the A230V mutation was most severely affected with an almost 40-fold reduction in activity. Product analysis also revealed a 3.4-fold reduction in cyclodextrin production for the A230V mutant, with a large increase in short linear saccharide formation when compared with wild type (not shown). All other mutants formed approximately the same amount of β- and γ-cyclodextrins as wild type, with lowered production of α-cyclodextrin (Fig. 2). How the mutations at the subsites -1/+1/+2 alter cyclodextrin product specificity is not yet clearly understood (29Leemhuis H. Dijkhuizen L. Biocatal. Biotransform. 2003; 21: 261-270Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Measurements of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for processing of the maltoheptaoside substrate pNPG7 in the disproportionation reaction with maltose as acceptor substrate revealed a 5-fold (F283L) to 18-fold (H140Q and K232E) reduction (Table 2). Surprisingly, the catalytic efficiency of the A230V/H140Q combination is much higher than that of its single mutant counterparts. The Km values for the acceptor substrate maltose were not significantly altered by most mutations, with only the H140Q mutant displaying a 2-fold decrease when compared with wild type (Table 2).TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of the disproportionation reaction of wild-type and mutant B. circulans 251 CGTases with the blocked pNPG7 and maltose substratesEnzymekcatKm, pNPG7Km, maltosekcat/Km, pNPG7s–1mmmms–1/mmWild type490 ± 100.09 ± 0.011.2 ± 0.175,444A230VaDue to elevated hydrolytic rates of A230V, only hydrolysis of pNPG7 could be measured.

Both the wild-type and the mutant proteins displayed irreversible thermal unfolding patterns. All mutants were significantly affected in stability, lowering the apparent melting temperature between 7 and 11 °C (Fig. 3). Mechanism and Effects of Acquired Inhibitor Resistance—As a general trend, most resistance-conferring mutations are located throughout the active site due to the substrate mimicking nature of small molecule inhibitor (Table 3). As active sites have primarily evolved for reaction specificity and rate enhancement, introduction of such mutations is expected to have a negative effect on the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. A trade-off between enzyme function and inhibitor resistance is indeed observed for enzymes with resistance-conferring mutations (14McCallum N. Karauzum H. Getzmann R. Bischoff M. Majcherczyk P.

Directed evolution of our model enzyme, BC251 CGTase, also resulted in most effective resistance-conferring mutations (A230V, K232E and F283L) clustered in and around the active site (Fig. 4). All three residues (Ala-230, Lys-232, and Phe-283) are conserved among CGTases (supplemental Table S1), indicating their important role in enzyme catalysis and reaction specificity. Replacement of such essential residues yielded variants with severely compromised catalytic function (Tables 1 and 2).TABLE 3Effects of evolved variants toward small molecule inhibitor insensitivity, on native enzyme function and stability · indicates active site.Enzyme (Inhibitor)Mutations (location)-Fold reductiona-Fold reduction indicates the factor of reduced inhibitor sensitivity of variants compared to wild-type based on IC50 or Ki valuesCost to nativebComparison between variants and wild-type based on kcat/Km for enzymatic activities and indicated thermostability testsReferenceActivityStabilityThymidylate synthase (5-fluorodeoxyuridine)T51S ·110.5653Kawate H.
