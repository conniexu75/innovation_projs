https://openalex.org/W1985697238,"Physiological and ecological results from a variety of species are consistent with what seem to be valid general statements concerning insect migration. These are as follows: (i)During migration locomotory functions are enhanced and vegetative functions such as feeding and reproduction are suppressed. (ii) Migration usually occurs prereproductively in the life of the adult insect (the oogenesis-flight syndrome). (iii)Since migrant individuals are usually prereproductive, their reproductive values, and hence colonizing abilities, are at or near maximum. (iv) Migrants usually reside in temporary habitats. (v)Migrants have a high potential for population increase, r, which is also advantageous for colonizers. (vi)Both the physiological and ecological parameters of migration are modifiable by environmental factors (that is, phenotypically modifiable)to suit the prevailing conditions. Taken together, these criteria establish a comprehensive theory and adumbrate the basic strategy for migrant insects. This basic strategy is modified to suit the ecological requirements of individual species. Comparative studies of these modifications are of considerable theoretical and practical interest, the more so since most economically important insects are migrants. No satisfactory general statements can as yet be made with respect to the genotype and migration. Certainly we expect colonizing populiations to possess genotypes favoring a high r, but genotypic variation in r depends on the heritabilities of life table statistics, and such measurements are yet to be made (10, 53). The fact that flight duration can be increased by appropriate selection in Oncopeltus fasciatus, and the demonstration of additive genetic variance for this trait in Lygaeus kalmii, suggest that heritability studies of migratory behavior would also be worth pursuing. Most interesting of course, will be possible genetic correlations between migration and life history parameters. Also, migration often transports genotypes across long distances with considerable mixing of populations. An understanding of its operation therefore carries with it implications for population genetics, zoogeography, and evolutionary theory. Finally, at least parts of the above general theory would seem to be applicable to forms other than insects. Bird and insect migrations, for example, are in many respects ecologically and physiologically similar. Birds, like insects, emphasize locomotory. as opposed to vegetative functions during long-distance flight; the well-known Zugenruhe or migratory restlessness is a case in point. Further, many birds migrateat nigt at a time when they would ordinarily roost(vegetative activity). Because their life spans exceed single seasons, bird migrants are not prereproductive in the same sense that insect migrants are, and hence reproductive values do not have the same meaning(but note that some insects are also interreproductive migrants). The situaion is complicated further by the fact that in many birds adult survivorship is virtually independent of age so that colonizing ability tends to be also (10, 54). Nevertheless, birds arrive on their nesting grounds in reproductive condition with the result that migration is a colonizing episode. It is also phenotypically modifiable by environmental factors, some of which, for example, photoperiod, influence insects as well (55). The similarities between birds and insects thus seem sufficient to indicate, at least provisionally, that the theory developed for insects applies also to birds with appropriate modifications for longer life span and more complex social behavior; comparisons between insects and fish (56) lead to the same conclusion. In birds especially, and also in other forms, various functions accessory to migration such as reproductive endocrinology, energy budgets, and orientation mechanisms have been studied extensively (55, 56). But there is need in vertebrates for more data andtheoy on the ecology and physiology of migratory behavior per se in order tobetter understand its evolution and its role in ecosystem function (5, 57). Migration in any animal cannot be understood until viewed in its entirety as a physiological, behavioral, and ecological syndrome."

Both micas are stable only in environments of high ammonia fugacity. Ammonia or nitrogen, or both, are released by thermal decomposition, cation exchange, or oxidation. The ammonia : nitrogen ratio in the gas depends primarily on the hydrogen fugacity and the temperature of the environment. Calculations show that, even in a predifferentiated Earth, nitrogen may have predominated. The total amount of nitrogen present on the surface of Earth could be accounted for by the decomposition of a layer of ammonium muscovite 170 meters thick."

This stridulation was acoustically distinct from stress sound and correlated with known attraction behavior. The response of female D. pseudotsugae to male stridulation-negation her attraction-was induced by playback of recorded attractant stridulation but not by that of stress sounds. Acoustic communication must be more important in scolytid behavior than it was heretofore believed to be."

In principle, augmentation (and duplication) of the installation and the launching of masses into orbit or into space could be accomplished with energy derived entirely from the rotation of the central body. In practice, a portion of the total energy requirement would probably be supplied by simple mechanical devices."

https://openalex.org/W1984477884,"Gonad-stimulating substance, a hormonal peptide released from the nervous system of starfishes, acts on the ovary to produce 1-methyladenine, an inducer of oocyte maturation. Addition of methionine to the incubation mixture of ovarian fragments and gonad-stimulating substance enhanced the production of 1-methyladenine, whereas ethionine inhibited it. Incubation of ovarian tissue with methionine alone failed to produce 1-methyladenine. Use of a radioactive label showed that methionine is a methyl donor in the biosynthesis of 1-methyladenine, suggesting that gonad-stimulating substance is involved in the methylation process."

https://openalex.org/W1978962332,"Trigonopsis cameronii females often work in groups of up to four individuals on single nests, and because of inbreeding and a tendency to return to the mother nest, nestmates are likely to be highly related. The altruistic behavior associated with group living, most notably the failure to steal prey from nestmates, can thus be explained by kin-selection theory."
https://openalex.org/W2055809079,"A mechanism is proposed whereby displacement between continents and the earth's pole of rotation (polar wandering) gives rise to latitudinal transport of continental plates (continental drift) because of their relatively greater rotational inertia. When extended to short-term polar wobble, the hypothesis predicts an energy change nearly equivalent to the seismic energy rate."
https://openalex.org/W2030305052,"Data accumulated during an intensive survey of Prehispanic settlements in the Ixtapalapa Peninsula region enables me to formulate hypotheses regarding the nature of sociocultural change and adaptation during the Prehispanic period. A summary of these hypotheses follows. The Early and Middle Formative period was a time of low population, when most communities were located on or near the agriculturally productive lakeshore plain zone. During the subsequent period, attendant upon the development in the central highlands of more productive varieties of maize, population increased, and for the first time the agriculturally marginal piedmont zone was colonized. This process may have resulted in the enhancement of status differentiation in these societies because some communities maintained access to the preferred land along the lakeshore plain zone. Also, occupation of a variety of environmental zones may have encouraged symbiosis, which could have further enhanced status differentiation as some individuals or groups became the focuses of exchange networks. During the Late Formative period, developments along this line proceeded throughout the Valley of Mexico, but later, during the Terminal Formative period, some groups prospered more than others because they were favorably situated for the construction of large-scale irrigation systems. The foremost example of the latter is Teotihuacan, which eventually dominated the population of the Ixtapalapa Peninsula region, as well as the remainder of the Valley of Mexico and probably adjacent groups in the central highlands. From A.D. 0 to A.D. 700, the region was dominated by Teotihuacan. This was a period of low population and apparently rural settlement patterns. A similar situation existed during the Late Toltec period as Tula dominated the region. I suggest that Teotihuacan and Tula had similar relationships with their rural peripheries; specifically, they were largely extractive and so dominated rural populations that they were the only important focuses of exchange and craft specialization. Population declined in the rural areas in part because they were too far from the urban centers to participate effectively in the exchange networks. In contrast, the Aztec period was characterized by the presence of a number of urban centers scattered widely over the valley; these centers served as the focuses of exchange and specialization. A similar situation may have characterized the Early Toltec period. During the Aztec period, the combination of intensive local and valleywide symbiosis plus the introduction of chinampas allowed the population to reach the greatest density of the Prehispanic period."

Recent advances include improved understanding of the basic factors affecting ion reaction rates, and application of these in metastable and collision-induced decompositions. Utilization of the unusual quantity of information in a high-resolution spectrum is greatly facilitated with on-line computers; identification and interpretation of spectra by computer techniques is faster and often more informative than the human counterpart. Feedback control from the computer makes possible the multiple rescanning of peaks in blank spectral regions, increasing signal quality and quantity dramatically. It appears that the application of a combination of these techniques of high-resolution mass spectrometry will give detailed amino acid sequence information on mixtures of peptides."

This difference in sensitivity is probably due to bleaching and implies that the larvae experience an asymmetric day."

When the hailstones are polarized by nearly vertical electrostatic field these vertically discharged water drops carry away free charge of the same sign as that induced on the upper surfaces. The hail thereby accumulates an equilibrium charge of opposite sign, corresponding to the charges induced on the bottom surfaces. The equilibrium charges are large enough to be important in thunderstorms."
