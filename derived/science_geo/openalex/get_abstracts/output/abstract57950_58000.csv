https://openalex.org/W1576198188,"Mitochondria were isolated from chicken liver and were then separated into fractions containing the outer membrane, the soluble components of the intermembrane space, the inner membrane, and the soluble enzymes of the matrix space. The manganosuperoxide dismutase was found primarily in the matrix space whereas the cuprozinc superoxide dismutase, previously isolated from the cytosol, was found in the intermembrane space. No activity was associated with the membranous fractions. A strain of petite mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae which lacks mitochondrial DNA, was examined and found to contain both the mangano- and the cuprozinc types of superoxide dismutase. This result indicates that the manganoenzyme, although localized in the mitochondrial matrix, is actually made under the directions of the nuclear genome and that its biosynthesis therefore probably takes place in the cytosol."

https://openalex.org/W1590837427,"Abstract Escherichia coli RNA molecules in the size range of 70 to 400 nucleotides have been characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by RNase T1 (EC 2.7.7.26) finger-printing. RNA labeled by 32PO43- for 20 min is separated into about 20 bands by electrophoresis in 5, 10, and 20% polyacrylamide gels; many of them represent pure RNA species. Some correspond to known molecules such as tRNAs, 5 S RNA, 4.5 S RNA, and 6 S RNA, but others have not been described previously. The amounts of these latter molecules are low, usually less than 10% of the level of 5 S RNA. One molecule, with electrophoretic mobility similar to 5 S RNA, has a 5'-terminal guanosine triphosphate. Another, with a mobility similar to that of 6 S RNA, contains dihydrouracil. Several different RNA preparation methods give essentially the same results. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% → 20% polyacrylamide) was used to purify RNA in the 4 S to 5 S region. This technique is capable of resolving at least 30 different RNA species; many of them are pure tRNA molecules. It allows for direct comparison of the quantities of purified tRNAs and the other molecules described in this paper. Such analysis shows that during 20 min labeling the newly characterized molecules accumulate at levels comparable to many individual tRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2049718720,"The migrational response of Salmonella typhimurium away from compounds such as phenol, indole, acetic acid, and leucine occurs because the bacteria tumble less frequently while descending gradients of repellents. This contrasts with their response of tumbling less frequently while ascending gradients of attractants. The results of competition experiments suggest that repellents, like attractants, operate through specific receptors, and the algebraic additivity experiments indicate that repellents and attractants utilize a common memory mechanism for taxis."
https://openalex.org/W2074141045,"ALTHOUGH vaccination has assisted the control of many bacterial diseases, parenteral vaccination against enteric disease is not as satisfactory as we could wish1. This is attributable to incomplete knowledge of both the pathogenesis of intestinal infections and the protective immune responses of the alimentary tract, with the result that vaccine development has been largely empirical. New knowledge of the specific determinants of microbial pathogenicity2 provides a sounder basis for the development of effective vaccines and the following report is an example of this approach to disease control."
https://openalex.org/W1481281898,"Abstract Ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli consists of two nonidentical subunits, proteins B1 and B2. Affinity chromatography resulted in a B1 preparation which appeared homogeneous during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. The molecular weight was 160,000 by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation using a partial specific volume of 0.706 ml per g at 4°. Protein B1 was composed of two polypeptide chains of similar or identical size, both having isoleucine as the COOH-terminal residue. In contrast, the NH2-terminal residues were different: glutamic acid and aspartic acid. This difference in amino acid composition was shown to reach further into the polypeptide chains. From these data the subunit structure of protein B1 seems to be of the type αα'. The αα' complex starts to dissociate in the absence of magnesium ions, and dissociation also occurred on oxidation of protein B1 in air. The latter dissociation was followed by an inactivation of the protein and was a result of oxidation of cysteine residues to cystines. Both dissociation and inactivation were reversed to a great extent by incubation in dithiothreitol. A homogeneous preparation of protein B2 had a molecular weight of 78,000 using a partial specific volume of 0.683 ml per g at 4°. This protein also was composed of two polypeptide chains of similar or identical size, but in this case both chains had the same NH2-terminal residue (alanine) and COOH-terminal residues (leucine). Analysis of tryptic peptides further supported the identity of the two chains. The subunit structure of protein B2 can therefore be designated β2. In the presence of the stimulatory effector dTTP proteins B1 and B2 formed a complex with a s20,w of 10.1 S and a molecular weight of 245,000. This indicates that the active form of ribonucleotide reductase consists of a 1:1 complex between proteins B1 and B2 of the type αα'β2. In the presence of the inhibitory effector dATP, proteins B1 and B2 form heavier complexes, the type of which are strongly influenced by the presence of sucrose."
https://openalex.org/W1573154650,"Abstract Proinsulin is converted to insulin in an impure secretion granule fraction prepared from rat islets of Langerhans that have been labeled before homogenization with [3H]leucine or [3H]arginine. During incubation of this particulate fraction at pH 6.3 and 37°, the initial rate of conversion of the endogenous labeled proinsulin is similar to that observed in whole islets, while externally added labeled proinsulin is not cleaved. Only intact granules catalyze conversion, and thus the pH optimum of about 6.0 for this process corresponds closely to that for granule stability. The most rapid in vitro cleavage of endogenous proinsulin is observed when the islets have been prelabeled with [3H]leucine for 30 min, followed by a 15-min chase to allow time for the transport of newly synthesized proinsulin to the Golgi apparatus and new secretory granules. Several proteinase inhibitors, including soybean trypsin inhibitor, pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, N-α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone·HCl, benzamidine, p-nitrophenyl-p'-guanidinobenzoate·HCl, N-ethylmaleimide, and iodoacetate, do not inhibit conversion in vitro, possibly due to a lack of permeability of the granules to some of these substances; high concentrations of p-chloromercuribenzoate completely inhibit conversion. The products of in vitro conversion have been characterized by polyacrylamide gel and thin layer electrophoresis as rat insulins I and II and their corresponding C-peptides. The residual proinsulin fraction after incubation consists mainly of partly cleaved intermediate forms. When islets are prelabeled with [3H]arginine before preparation of the granule fraction, in vitro conversion is accompanied by the release from the cleavage regions of free arginine rather than dipeptides of arginine or lysylarginine. Granule preparations disrupted by repeated freeze-thawing lose their ability to introduce cleavages in intact proinsulin but are still able to rapidly remove COOH-terminal arginine residues from lightly trypsinized proinsulin. A low level of tryptic-like activity, as indicated by the slow cleavage of N-α-tosyl-l-[methyl-3H]arginine methyl ester, can still be detected in the disrupted preparations. These results are in accord with the hypothesis that enzyme(s) having trypsin-like and carboxypeptidase B-like activity exist in the secretory granules of the β-cells and participate in the conversion of proinsulin to insulin. The nature and precise subcellular localization of these proteolytic enzymes, as well as their possible relationship to the exocrine pancreatic proteases, remain to be clarified."
https://openalex.org/W1537939025,"Abstract The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae X2180, the strain most commonly used for genetic studies on yeasts, was treated with the mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate, and mutants defective in the synthesis of cell wall mannan were isolated. The initial selection of mutants was made on the basis of their failure to agglutinate with antiserum that was specific for the mannotetraose side chain of the mannan, the immuno-dominant group of this yeast strain, which has the structure αMan(1→3)αMan(1→2)αMan(1→2)Man. Nonagglutinating cells were assumed to have modified mannan structures, and this was confirmed by chemical analysis of the isolated mutant mannans. Two classes of mutants were obtained. One was apparently defective in the formation of the α-1→3-mannosyl-transferase (mnn1) which is presumed to be involved in the addition of the terminal α-1→3-linked mannose unit to form the mannotetraose side chain. The other class was defective in one of two α-1→2-mannosyltransferases that must be involved in adding the two α-1→2-linked mannose units, one of them (mnn2) directly to the α-1→6-linked mannose units in the backbone of the polysaccharide and the other (mnn3) to this first side chain mannose unit. No mutant was obtained that was defective in forming the backbone. Since such a mutation would yield a cell completely lacking mannan, it might be lethal. Complementation studies on diploid crosses of representatives of the different mutant classes gave results that were consistent with the interpretations based on chemical analysis of the mutant mannans. Thus, diploids obtained from crosses between mnn1 x mnn2, mnn2 x mnn3, or mnn1 x mnn3 mutants all made mannan of the X2180 chemotype. We conclude that all of the mutations involve structural genes for the various mannosyltransferases that are required for mannan synthesis and not regulatory genes that control expression of a particular mannan chemotype."
https://openalex.org/W1868644750,"Abstract Protein synthesis initiation was studied using preincubated reticulocyte ribosomes, and the transfer of methionine from Met-tRNAfmet into the NH2-terminal positions of the polypeptides synthesized in response to poly[r(U-G)] and poly[r(A-U-G)] messengers was measured. Methionine transfer reactions in the above systems were dependent on the addition of 0.5 m KCl wash of reticulocyte ribosomes (I fraction). The I fraction was further purified by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. At least three protein factors (IF-1, IF-2, IF-3) that eluted from the column stimulated both poly[r(U-G)]- and poly[r(A-U-G)]-directed methionine transfer reactions. However, the ability of these factors to catalyze the methionine transfer reactions in response to poly[r(U-G)] and poly[r(A-U-G)] messengers (containing two different initiation codons GUG and AUG) was significantly different. Also, these three factors when added together catalyzed more than additive transfer of methionine in response to poly[r(U-G)] messenger but not in response to poly[r(A-U-G)] messenger. A protein factor also found in the crude I fraction that eluted similarly to IF-1 on DEAE-cellulose chromatography, bound Met-tRNAfmet in the presence of GTP. The complex formed was quantitatively retained on Millipore filter and was assayed accordingly. The complex formation was specific for reticulocyte Met-tRNAfmet. Escherichia coli Met-tRNAfmet and f-Met-tRNAfmet also form similar complexes with IF-1; however, this complex formation was not GTP dependent. A preformed Met-tRNAfmet (reticulocyte) complex was more active in methionine transfer reactions than free Met-tRNAfmet (reticulocyte), indicating that this complex formation is an essential step in peptide chain initiation. Another protein factor (Fx) was obtained by re-extraction of the 0.5 m KCl-washed ribosomes with 1 m KCl. This factor bound Met-tRNAfmet and other aminoacyl tRNAs in the absence of GTP. As was the IF-1 complex, the aminoacyl tRNAs-Fx complexes were retained on Millipore filters and were assayed accordingly. The Fx fraction possibly binds unspecifically to different RNA species as the binding of Met-tRNAfmet to Fx was inhibited by addition of uncharged crude reticulocyte tRNA, poly(r-U), poly(r-A), and poly(r-U):poly(r-A). The Fx fraction strongly inhibited protein synthesis in response to poly[r(U-G)], poly[r(A-U-G)], and poly(r-U) messengers. With poly(r-U) messenger tested, the inhibition of polyphenylalanine synthesis by Fx fraction was overcome by increasing the poly(r-U) concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1619411151,"Abstract The accumulation of small RNAs (4 to 6 S) in Escherichia coli during amino acid starvation has been studied by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and two-dimensional fingerprint analysis. In CP78, a stringent (rel+) strain, RNA labeled with 32PO43- during amino acid starvation has a gel electrophoresis pattern that is very different from that of nonstarved cells. However, in CP79, a relaxed (rel-) mutant, RNA labeled during starvation has a gel pattern similar to normal. During starvation of the stringent strain, 32PO43- labeling of 5 S RNA, 4.5 S RNA, and most tRNAs is reduced to about 5% normal. The accumulation of an unstable molecule containing dihydrouracil, with an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of 6 S RNA, is also reduced. In contrast, 6 S RNA (which is stable) and an unstable molecule with GTP at its 5' end are much less severely reduced, if at all. Thus the accumulation of these molecules during stringent control is noncoordinate and the inhibition of accumulation is not necessarily correlated with metabolic stability. When cells of the stringent strain are treated with the antibiotic trimethoprim, an undermethylated form of tRNALeu1 appears as the most highly labeled single species of the small RNAs. Trimethoprim treatment reduces both the level of bulk tRNA labeling and the extent of tRNA methylation. These effects of trimethoprim are inhibited by the addition of methionine to the medium. The various RNA molecules are labeled with different kinetics. In short labeling periods the GTP-starting unstable molecule is one of the most highly labeled species. From radioactivity pulse-chase experiments under normal and starvation conditions it was found that amino acid starvation does not seem to affect the stability of the RNAs."

https://openalex.org/W37729912,"Valinomycin-induced uptake of rubidium by membrane vesicles prepared from Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus denitrificans is analogous in nearly all respects to the transport of sugars or amino acids, or both, by these membrane vesicles. In E. coli membrane vesicles, concentrative rubidium uptake is stimulated maximally by d -lactate and by the artificial electron donor ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate, to a lesser extent by l -lactate, dl -α-hydroxybutyrate, succinate, and reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide, and not at all by ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate, or a number of other metabolites. There is no direct relationship between the ability of various electron donors to stimulate rubidium uptake (ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate >> d -lactate >> l -lactate g dl -α-hydroxybutyrate g succinate g reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide) and their rates of oxidation by membrane vesicles (ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate >> reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide g succinate g d -lactate g l -lactate g dl -α-hydroxybutyrate). In the presence of d -lactate and valinomycin, the initial rate of rubidium uptake versus the rate of d -lactate oxidation yields a ratio of nearly 2:1. Initial rates of d -lactate-dependent rubidium uptake are saturable with respect to rubidium and valinomycin concentrations and exhibit the same temperature optimum at 50° as that observed for d -lactate oxidation. Steady state levels of rubidium accumulation vary with temperature and can be shifted readily from one steady state level to another by raising or lowering the temperature. Competitive uptake and displacement experiments indicate that rubidium and potassium are equivalent substrates for valinomycin-induced uptake. Rubidium uptake in the presence of valinomycin is markedly inhibited by anaerobiosis, by the electron transfer inhibitors oxamate, amytal, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide and cyanide, and by p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate, but not by arsenate or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; inhibition by p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate is reversed by dithiothreitol. Moreover, anaerobiosis, amytal, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, and cyanide produce rapid efflux of rubidium from the vesicles. Oxamate and p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate, however, cause little or no efflux of rubidium accumulated in the presence of valinomycin, even though p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate-treated vesicles catalyze exchange of intravesicular rubidium with external potassium at normal rates. These findings indicate that valinomycin does not simply catalyze the passive transfer of rubidium across the vesicle membrane. Valinomycin-induced active rubidium uptake is accompanied by the rapid efflux of intravesicular sodium against its concentration gradient. The vesicles are passively permeable to the lipophilic dibenzyldimethylammonium ion; however, this cation does not inhibit rubidium uptake or rubidium-induced sodium efflux and does not cause sodium efflux. Moreover, radioactive dibenzyldimethylammonium is not accumulated by membrane vesicles under conditions in which rubidium is actively transported. Valinomycin, in the presence of potassium, has no significant effect on the transient acidification of the medium observed upon addition of d -lactate to the vesicles. In addition, vesicles treated with Tween 40 such that they are rendered devoid of a diffusion barrier exhibit pH changes similar to those of untreated vesicles. These findings indicate that active rubidium uptake is an electrogenic process and that proton or potential gradients are not the primary driving force for respiration-linked active transport in isolated bacterial membrane vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W1580257733,"Abstract Previous physical studies from this laboratory by sedimentation velocity and diffusion and by sedimentation equilibrium (Yue, R. H., Ratliff, R. L., and Kuby, S. A. (1967) Biochemistry 6, 2923–2932) have permitted an assignment of the kinetic molecular weight of the crystalline brewers' yeast nucleoside diphosphokinase, namely 102,000 (±2,000) at infinite dilution. The observed concentration dependence of its weight average molecular weight value (Yue et al.) was likely, in part, the result of a complex set of association-dissociation equilibria. Evidence presented here and derived (a) from the amino acid analyses, tryptic peptides, and terminal group analyses; (b) from sedimentation equilibrium studies on the native enzyme and on its S-carboxymethylated derivative, in the presence of disruptive agents; (c) from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.2% dodecyl sulfate; and (d) from gel filtration through 8% agarose in 6 m guanidinium chloride, all indicate that the protein molecule is composed of six similar, if not identical, subunits. The best value for the individual subunit molecular weight (of this hexameric structure) may be selected from its amino acid composition, 17,300 ± 500. The NTP-NDP transphosphorylase appears to be unique among the other ATP-transphosphorylases studied in this laboratory, in that it possesses a single, shielded sulfhydryl group per subunit polypeptide chain, and in that it displays unusual resistance to inactivation by guanidinium chloride."
https://openalex.org/W1656313990,"Abstract The 1- and 7-ribosyl 5'-phosphates of oxipurinol [4,6-dihydroxypyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidine] were enzymatically synthesized. These nucleotides, 3-xanthosine 5'-phosphate, and the 1-ribosyl 5'-phosphate of allopurinol [4-hydroxypyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidine] were characterized by spectral, chromatographic, and enzymatic procedures. The oxipurinol nucleotides were found to be potent competitive inhibitors of orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase from yeast. This enzyme exhibited bimodal substrate saturation kinetics, the characteristics of which were consistent with the involvement of a single enzyme. Inhibition by nucleotides was also bimodal; thus, two Ki values could be determined for each inhibitor. The most effective inhibitor tested was 1-ribosyloxipurinol 5'-phosphate, which had Ki values of 0.02 and 0.003 µm at high (12 to 48 µm) and low (0.5 to 2 µm) substrate concentrations, respectively. The corresponding N-7 derivative had corresponding Ki values of 0.7 and 0.06 µm. 1-Ribosylallopurinol 5'-phosphate, 3-xanthosine 5'-phosphate, and several naturally occurring nucleotides were less inhibitory. Nucleotide inhibitors also stabilized the enzyme against loss of activity at 37°. Inhibition constants determined with the enzyme from rat liver were similar to those from yeast. The findings furnish direct, quantitative support for the idea that it is the inhibition of orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase by the nucleotides of oxipurinol that is primarily responsible for the increased urinary excretion of orotic acid and orotidine in patients treated with allopurinol."

https://openalex.org/W1623403625,"Abstract Enzymatically prepared DNA fragments have been fractionated according to molecular weight on agarose columns. The upper limit of fractionation on the most porous gel used (Sepharose 2B) corresponds to a molecular weight of about 0.85·106 for double-stranded DNA. The relationships between kav and [η] or s as well as the [η] versus s relationship were determined for the 2B fractions. Sepharose 6B columns have been used to fractionate both native and denatured DNA fragments having a molecular weight lower than about 3.5·105. Sedimentation equilibrium studies using the short column technique (Van Holde, K. E., and Baldwin, R. L. (1958) J. Phys. Chem. 62, 734) at high speed (Yphantis, D. A. (1964) Biochemistry 3, 297), which only requires 0.5 µg of DNA, were done on the 6B chromatographic fractions. These were found to be practically monodisperse (Mz/Mω ≤ 1.1). Relationships between the sedimentation coefficients and the molecular weights of the 6B chromatographic fractions of native and denatured DNA and their elution volumes were determined. At the same time, the relationships between s and Mω were established in a molecular weight range where no data were previously available."

https://openalex.org/W1550700730,"Abstract A procedure has been devised for the purification of the biosynthetic l-threonine deaminase (l-threonine hydrolase, deaminating: EC 4.2.1.16) from a genetically derepressed mutant, strain TIR8, of Escherichia coli K-12. The procedure produces a purification of 400-fold relative to derepressed enzyme levels and 4000-fold relative to repressed levels. The purity of the final enzyme preparation has been determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and by sedimentation equilibrium experiments. The native enzyme, molecular weight 204,000, is a tetramer composed of four apparently identical subunits, molecular weight 51,000. When the native enzyme is resolved of its cofactor, pyridoxal 5'-monophosphate, catalytically inactive apodimers, molecular weight 102,000, are formed. Addition of pyridoxal 5'-monophosphate to the apodimers promotes reassociation to catalytically active tetramers. The kinetic data of the l-threonine deaminase reaction are similar with the pure enzyme and with partially purified preparations. l-Isoleucine is a competitive allosteric inhibitor. The enzyme exhibits cooperative homotropic interactions with respect to the substrate only in the presence of l-isoleucine. These interactions are reversed by l-valine. The enzyme exists in a pH-dependent equilibrium between two distinct and catalytically active species; a tetramer sensitive to l-isoleucine inhibition and a dimer insensitive to l-isoleucine inhibition. The tetramer is favored at pH values from 6.0 to 7.5 while at pH values from 8.5 to 10.0 the enzyme is present almost exclusively as the dimer. At pH 8.0 a mixture of the two is present."
https://openalex.org/W1586569143,"A chymotryptic-like fragment of the rat proinsulin connecting peptide (C-peptide) has been isolated from whole rat pancreas. Amino acid analysis and partial sequence determination showed the fragment to contain the NH2-terminal 22 residues of C-peptide I. A radioactive fragment of similar electrophoretic mobility was also isolated from rat pancreatic islets which had been incubated with [3H]-leucine. Stepwise Edman degradation of the radioactive fragment showed the positions of its leucine residues to be identical with those of the unlabeled material. Homogenization of [3H]leucine-labeled rat C-peptide with whole pancreas and extraction under conditions used for the isolation of the fragment did not result in cleavage of the C-peptide to the fragment. Furthermore, the fractional ratio of fragment to C-peptide (normally about 0.2) did not increase when rat islets were incubated with [3H]leucine for 1 hour and then incubated with unlabeled leucine for 1, 2, or 3 hours. Treatment of a mixture of [3H]leucine-labeled proinsulin and proinsulin intermediates with high amounts of trypsin resulted in the release of the C-peptide fragment as well as desglutamine (residue 31) C-peptide. It is concluded that a chymotrypsin-like cleavage in the C-peptide region of proinsulin or in one of its intermediates occurs normally during the conversion of proinsulin to insulin in the rat."
https://openalex.org/W1599372957,"Abstract Polyadenylate sequences of 100 to 200 AMP residues can be covalently attached to the 3' hydroxyl group of several polyribonucleotides, but not to deoxypolyribonucleotides, with a magnesium-activated poly(A) polymerase from calf thymus nuclei. Examination of a limited number of well defined RNAs indicates that the reaction is relatively non-specific for small RNAs, since poly(A)'s of 50 to 100 AMPs, transfer RNAs, and RNA fragments from extracts of the enzyme were effective primers. In the latter case, no specificity could be detected for the nucleotide at the 3' end, but the nucleotides of all four bases were used as sites of initiation of poly(A) chains. Size and shape appear to be important, however, as short AMP oligomers were far less effective on a molar basis than (Ap)40A, while poly(A) sequences could not be attached to native 28 S RNA or the MS-2 phage RNA, but only to fragments derived from them. Available data on this polymerase and the reaction it catalyzes are compatible with a role for it in the post-transcriptional addition of poly(A) sequences to the heterogeneous RNA of eucaryotic nuclei."

https://openalex.org/W1552473798,"Abstract Replacement of Zn(II) by Cd(II) in aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli gives rise to an intense circular dichroism difference spectrum with a maximum ellipticity at 259 nm of 44,000 deg cm2 per dmole of Cd(II). This Cotton effect can be assigned to the Cd(II) chromophore and used as a sensitive spectral probe of metal site conformational changes. When circular dichroism difference spectra for carbamyl phosphate and succinate binding to Cd(II)-aspartate transcarbamylase are compared with the corresponding circular dichroism difference spectra for Zn(II)-aspartate transcarbamylase, perturbations of the Cd(II)-chromophore are apparent. Thus, conformational changes at metal ion binding sites in the regulatory subunits occur when substrate or substrate analogue molecules bind at active sites in the catalytic subunits. Conversely, replacement of Zn(II) by Cd(II) slightly alters the kinetic and binding parameters of native aspartate transcarbamylase. Thus, alteration of the metal ion binding site structure alters the conformation of the active site. These observations show that a coupling exists between conformational changes at metal ion sites in regulatory subunits and active sites in catalytic subunits. Consequently, conformational changes at metal ion binding sites may be involved in the allosteric mechanism of homotropic interactions. The binding of the feedback inhibitor, CTP, either to Cd(II)-regulatory subunit or to Cd(II)-aspartate transcarbamylase causes no change in the circular dichroism of the Cd(II)-chromophore. Thus, the metal ion does not seem to be directly involved either in the binding of CTP or in the mechanism of communicating heterotropic interactions. Since the metal ion sites are implicated in homotropic interactions, but not in heterotropic interactions, the allosteric mechanisms of these two effects must involve different sets of conformational changes. To assess the linkage between conformational changes at different loci in aspartate transcarbamylase, circular dichroism changes at different wave lengths were monitored during ligand titrations. For Cd(II)-aspartate transcarbamylase, the apparent carbamyl phosphate concentration required for half-maximal change is 0.32 mm at 280 nm (tyrosyl chromophore) but 0.10 mm at 256 nm (Cd(II)-chromophore). The succinate concentration required for half-maximal change is 0.20 mm at 256 nm (Cd(II)-chromophore) but 0.40 mm at 290 nm (tryptophanyl chromophore). These results demonstrate the existence of multiple conformational equilibria for the binding of these substrate ligands and suggest that allosteric interactions of aspartate transcarbamylase cannot adequately be described by a two-state model."

https://openalex.org/W1517155765,"Abstract A quantitative specific assay for the regulatory subunit of aspartate transcarbamylase is described. The assay, in which the native enzyme will not interfere even when present in large excess, is sensitive to 5 ng of regulatory subunit at a concentration as low as 0.1 µg per mg in crude extracts. The assay utilizes a 125I-labeled catalytic subunit which combines spontaneously with regulatory subunit to form a complex which co-migrates with the native enzyme on acrylamide gel electrophoresis in a position clearly separable from the 125I-catalytic subunit. The amount of regulatory subunit can then be calculated from the known weight ratio in the enzyme complex. Mutants of Salmonella typhimurium defective in aspartate transcarbamylase activity are shown to still synthesize regulatory subunit, while a mutant constitutive for the enzymes in the pathway for pyrimidine biosynthesis is shown to produce an excess of free regulatory subunit over native enzyme. A new procedure for iodination of proteins under mild conditions is described. It utilizes a preoxidation of iodide to iodine under conditions of stoichiometric or very low excess of oxidizing agent followed by reaction with the protein. It is used on a microscale to prepare 125I-catalytic subunit having properties virtually indistinguishable from the native protein."

https://openalex.org/W1591468608,Abstract The kinetics of inactivation of apo- and holo-tryptophanase are shown to be very different. The influence of covalent binding of pyridoxal phosphate on the stability of the tetramer has been studied. It is shown that saturation of a limited percentage of coenzyme-binding sites per enzyme molecule is sufficient to confer to the hybrid tetramer the thermal stability of the holoenzyme. The structural and energetic implications of this finding are discussed.

Absorption studies with human embryonic tissues suggest that S(2) may be a fetal antigen. The presence of antibody to S(2) in patients with tumors and in their relatives implies a propensity in these individuals for cellular dedifferentiation which may be a prerequisite for malignant transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1494369352,"Abstract A major and a minor lysine-specific transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) were purified from the haploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae αS288C by column chromatography on benzoylated diethylaminoethylcellulose. The nucleotide sequence of the major lysine tRNA was determined by use of 32P-labeled material. The molecule is 76 nucleotide residues in length and contains the anticodon C-U-U. In experiments to determine coding specificity, the major lysine tRNA showed the greatest response with the codon A-A-G. Preliminary studies on the structure of the minor lysine tRNA showed that its structure is most probably identical with one of the two major lysine tRNAs from bakers' yeast. The minor lysine tRNA recognizes both the lysine codons A-A-G and A-A-A weakly. The anticodon proposed for bakers' yeast lysine tRNA is S-U-U, where S is the 3'-phosphate of 2-thio-5-carboxymethyluridine. The major lysine tRNA differs from bakers' yeast lysine tRNA in a total of 21 nucleotides. Only the G-T-ψ-C loop and its supporting stem are identical."
https://openalex.org/W1599960967,"Abstract Two wild type strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which differ in the structure of their cell wall mannans, have been hybridized and the genetic control of the mannan structure expressed in the diploid has been investigated. The mannan of one strain (X2180) is characterized by the presence of a mannotetraose side chain, while the other (strain 4484-24D) possesses a mannosylphosphorylmannotriose side chain in place of the mannotetraose unit. The diploid had the X2180 mannan chemotype rather than an average mixture of the two. Sporulation and tetrad analysis of the diploid hybrids demonstrated that the two mannan chemotypes segregated 2:2 as though the difference were under the control of a single gene, and from a detailed genetic analysis we have mapped the dominant gene to chromosome V, tightly linked to ura3 and the centromere. It is the first gene concerned with mannan biosynthesis to be placed on the yeast genetic map and it has been designated mnn1. From the observed differences between the structures of the mannans of strains X2180 and 4484-24D, we conclude that the gene is involved in the synthesis of an α-1→3-mannosyltransferase which adds the terminal α-1→3-linked mannose unit to α-1→2-linked mannotriose side chains in the mannan. The mechanism which prevents the expression of the mannosylphosphate group on the surface of the hybrid diploid cell is unknown, but it must be related to the processes which control the organization of the mannan in the cell wall."
https://openalex.org/W1538689657,"Abstract Previous experiments have shown that RNase A from which the last 6 residues have been removed enzymatically can be reactivated by mixture with synthetic peptides containing 9 to 14 residues of the COOH-terminal sequence. In such experiments there were at least 3 overlapping residues in the recombination. To avoid the overlap, 9 residues have now been removed by treating RNase-(1-118) with yeast carboxypeptidase which hydrolyzes the sequence that includes Pro117. A 10th residue (Tyr115) could be removed by further hydrolysis with carboxypeptidase A. RNase-(1-115) and RNase-(1-114) were found to be largely unfolded at 25°, whereas RNase-(1-118) had a transition temperature of 33°. When the synthetic Peptide-(116-124) was added to RNase-(1-115) or RNase-(1-114), the transition temperature of the complex was about 38°. The binding of the peptide to these proteins is more than 10 times as strong as it is to RNase-(1-118). The Km values with the cyclic cytidylic acid substrate are the same as for the native enzyme. The maximum regenerated activity, about 50%, did not differ from that obtained when the overlap was present. When the 14-residue Peptide(111-124), which gave 98% activity with RNase 1-118, was added the regeneration of activity was still only 50%. These results indicate that the removal of Val118, Pro117, and Val116 unfolds the chain to an extent that is not completely reversible through complex formation with the 14-residue peptide to give the precise orientation of His119 necessary for full catalytic activity. The complex between RNase-(1-114) and Peptide-(116-124) lacks Tyr115 and yet is as active as the other complexes; Tyr115 is thus not essential for complex formation or for activity in bovine RNase, and this conclusion fits with the finding by Jackson and Hirs that in porcine RNase tyrosine is replaced by proline at position 115."
https://openalex.org/W1543478617,"Abstract Carbamyl phosphate, the first ligand in the ordered sequence of binding to the hexameric enzyme aspartate transcarbamylase, binds tightly to half of the active sites in the absence of other ligands. This partial saturation is changed by the binding of succinate, an unreactive aspartate analogue. Succinate binding increases the number of high affinity carbamyl phosphate binding sites from three to six, thereby increasing the number of sites to which it can bind. This unmasking of sites can contribute to the cooperative interactions between active sites in this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1560714500,"Abstract A messenger RNA preparation from Clostridium pasteurianum is active in stimulating protein synthesis in vitro by ribosomes and initiation factors derived from C. pasteurianum or from Escherichia coli. Other messengers tested, f2 RNA, T4 early mRNA, and E. coli mRNA, are active with ribosomes and initiation factors derived from E. coli, but not with those derived from C. pasteurianum. By testing the heterologous combinations of salt-washed ribosomes and initiation factors from these two bacterial species in protein synthesis assays, it was demonstrated that the salt-washed ribosomes, and not the initiation factors, control the specificity of mRNA translation and also determine the characteristic magnesium optimum for protein synthesis. The initiation factors influence the efficiency of translation obtained with each type of mRNA. The relative efficiency of translation observed when using E. coli initiation factors and when using C. pasteurianum initiation factors varies with the different types of mRNA. The heterologous combinations of salt-washed ribosomes and initiation factors from the two bacterial species were also tested for their ability to bind fMet-tRNA in response to f2 RNA, T4 early mRNA, and C. pasteurianum mRNA. These assays demonstrated the same difference in messenger specificities between the two ribosomal systems as was found in the protein synthesis assays. Moreover, the results indicated, in agreement with the protein synthesis assays, that the salt-washed ribosomes, and not the initiation factors, control the specificity of mRNA recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1602879876,"Abstract The galactose-binding protein, a necessary component of the β-methylgalactoside transport system of Escherichia coli K12 mediates the uptake of galactose against a concentration gradient. The equilibrium state of accumulation is characterized by the simultaneous entry and exit of galactose. However, in contrast to the lactose transport system of E. coli, energy coupling occurs during entry but not exit of galactose, and counterflow for the entry process could not be demonstrated in poisoned cells. Transmembranal stimulation can be observed for the exit but not for the entry of galactose and requires the presence of a functional galactose-binding protein. The galactose-binding protein mediates only the entry and not the exit of galactose. Exit of galactose is mediated either by other components of the β-methylgalactoside transport system or by an entirely different transport system specific for galactose."

https://openalex.org/W1597925536,"Abstract The physicochemical properties of the antileukemic l-asparaginase from Erwinia carotovora have been studied and compared with those of the corresponding clinically effective enzyme from Escherichia coli B. Although both enzymes are tetramers with similar molecular weight, the amino acid compositions are distinctly different and the Erwinia enzyme is more basic as judged by polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Of the 48 to 50 tyrosyl residues in native Erwinia asparaginase, only about 10% ionize with a normal pK, while 30% of these residues in the E. coli enzyme titrate normally. The native tetramer (s20,w = 7.2) is considerably more stable than the corresponding tetramer from E. coli. Asparaginase from Erwinia is only partially dissociated in 8 m urea, whereas the E. coli enzyme is completely converted to the 1.7 S monomer under the same conditions. Guanidinium chloride at concentrations of 3.5 m completely dissociates Erwinia asparaginase. Dissociation is accompanied by the appearance of an ultraviolet difference spectrum with a maximum at 288 nm. The rate of dissociation is markedly increased by the addition of alcohols to the denaturant. Dissociation in the presence of alcohols occurs in two distinct steps whose rates increase as the length of the alkyl side chain of the alcohol increases. Succinylation of the lysyl residues results in marked increases in mobility of the modified enzyme on polyacrylamide gels, but does not affect the state of aggregation of the tetramer or its catalytic activity. In addition succinylation does not affect either the rate of dissociation in guanidinium chloride or the extent of reconstitution to the active enzyme. The presence of five bands on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of hybrids prepared from the native and succinylated enzyme indicates that Erwinia carotovora asparaginase is composed of four identical subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1512891256,"Abstract The binding of l-serine and ATP to seryl-tRNA synthetase from Escherichia coli was examined by equilibrium dialysis. The gel filtration method of Hummel and Dryer ((1962) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 63, 530) was used to estimate the binding of the enzyme to tRNAser. The molar ratio of substrate bound to the enzyme in each instance was approximately 2:1, suggesting that each subunit has one binding site for each of the substrates. Several sulfhydryl reagents were employed to evaluate the role of the thiol groups in the synthetase. When the enzyme was treated with high concentrations of 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) or [14C]iodoacetamide, only 1 of the 10 cysteinyl residues per subunit was modified and the enzyme retained full aminoacylation activity. On the other hand, reaction with equivalent concentrations of [14C]iodoacetate appeared to be a two-step process. The initial rate of carboxymethylation was characterized by a hyberbolic curve which slowly progressed to a point where 0.75 to 0.9 carboxymethyl groups were incorporated per subunit, with no detectable inactivation. At this point, the reaction rate increased in an exponential fashion and was accompanied by a nonlinear loss of enzyme activity. Similarly, titration of seryl-tRNA synthetase with p-mercuribenzoate (PMB) was characterized by a linear inactivation-inhibitor concentration relationship which required 20 moles of PMB per mole of enzyme for complete inactivation, suggesting that sulfhydryl group modification with PMB is an all-or-none event. It is proposed that the thiol groups of the seryl-tRNA synthetase possess a structural rather than a catalytic role. Seryl-tRNA synthetase was covalently linked to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose and this material was used for chromatography of tRNA from E. coli. A one-step purification of serine transfer RNA was achieved. The stable Sepharose-synthetase conjugate has also been used to study the effects of reagents such as urea on the dissociation of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1566945429,"Abstract The in vitro assembly of Escherichia coli 50 S ribosomes from the ribonucleic acid and protein components of 50 S ribosomes was attempted. The two components were prepared by subjecting 50 S ribosomes to LiCl-urea treatment. The ribonucleic acid fraction contains 23 S RNA and 5 S RNA in equimolar amounts and is free from significant amounts of protein. The protein fraction is composed of all of the protein subunits of 50 S ribosomes. The reconstitution experiments were carried out in a standard system: 0.01 m Tris HCl, pH 7.5–0.3 m KCl-0.02 m magnesium acetate-0.006 m β-mercaptoethanol. The ribosomal RNA and protein components were incubated in the standard system at 42° for 15 min. These conditions permitted the formation of 30 S ribosomes from their components with 72% recovery of the original activity, as measured by polyuridylic acid-directed phenylalanine incorporation. Under identical conditions, the RNA and protein components of 50 S ribosomes were assembled stoichiometrically into 37 S particles. In a search for a chemical agent that would effectively reassemble particles of more compact structure, we found that spermine or spermidine or both, in addition to Mg++, led to the formation of 45 to 48 S ribonucleoprotein particles with all of the macromolecular components of 50 S ribosomes. The 45 to 48 S particles and 37 S particles were inactive in terms of polyuridylic acid-directed phenylalanine incorporation, the peptidyltransferase reaction and peptide chain termination reaction. We also showed that 23 S ribonucleoprotein particles are assembled in the absence of Mg++ and polyamines. The particles continuously increase in sedimentation constant from 23 S to 26 S when Mg++ is gradually increased to 10-2 m. Above 10-2 m Mg++, 36 S particles appear and the sedimentation constant of the particles plateaus at 37 to 39 S at the concentration higher than 2 x 10-2 m Mg++. Spermine or spermidine, in addition to Mg++, further increased the sedimentation constant of the particles continuously to 45 to 48 S. The process is the reversal of the previously reported unfolding of 50 S ribosomes by citrate-Mg++ treatment. NH4Cl, in place of KCl, or the pH in a range between 7 and 8 had no significant effects on the ribosomal assembly. Mg++ or Mg++ plus polyamine(s) have to be added to the assembly system at zero time. The later those cations are added, the more unfolded are the resultant particles. The incorporation of 5 S RNA into the assembled ribonucleoprotein particles is stoichiometric and highly specific so that no significant incorporation of tRNA was observed."
https://openalex.org/W1486810765,"Abstract The effects of cryolysis on the inducible regulatory enzyme, cysteine desulfhydrase from Salmonella typhimurium, were examined. The stoichiometry of product formation catalyzed by partially purified preparations changes from one sulfide to one pyruvate to as much as 1:0.3 as a function of slow freezing and thawing. The ratio of the value for Vmax of sulfide formation to the value for Vmax of pyruvate formation also changes. The order of substrate dependence (n from Hill plots) does not change when velocity is measured via sulfide formation but changes from 1.9 to as much as 3 when velocity is measured via pyruvate formation. Cryolyzed preparations apparently catalyze the abnormal decomposition of cysteine to alanine and sulfide instead of pyruvate, ammonia, and sulfide. Methionine and dithiothreitol prevent the changes that occur upon freeze-aging. Sephadex G-200 chromatography revealed the presence in crude extracts of a protein (P II) with a Kd three times greater than that of cysteine desulfhydrase, and which is capable of converting altered enzyme to native enzyme. The addition of P II to cryolyzed preparations restores the 1:1 stoichiometry of product formation, restores the native order of substrate dependence of pyruvate formation, and prevents the formation of alanine. This restorative protein is heat stable. It has thiopyruvate desulfurase activity and is induced in parallel with cysteine desulfhydrase. It is proposed that: (a) P II activity represents a catalytic subunit of cysteine desulfhydrase which displays thiopyruvate desulfurase activity instead of cysteine desulfhydrase activity; (b) the catalytic subunit is cold-labile when present in native enzyme but is stable to both heat and cold when in the free subunit form; (c) the cryolysis of native enzyme results in the formation of an altered enzyme containing an altered catalytic subunit. This altered enzyme catalyzes the abnormal production of alanine and sulfide from cysteine instead of pyruvate, ammonia, and sulfide, resulting in a decrease of the 1:1 stoichiometry of pyruvate and sulfide production; (d) the addition of P II to freeze-altered enzyme results in the exchange of good catalytic subunits for altered ones, regenerating the native enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1490772730,"Abstract Biodegradative threonine deaminase exhibits an absorption maximum at 415 nm presumably due to the Schiff base formation between pyridoxal phosphate and e-amino group of a lysine residue of the enzyme protein. The addition of the substrate, l-threonine, to the enzyme solution causes a transient shift of this absorption maximum to 430 nm and the absorption spectrum returns to the starting maximum as the substrate becomes depleted. This spectral change corresponds to the appearance and disappearance of a peak at 455 nm in the difference spectra of the enzyme in the presence and absence of l-threonine. Detailed kinetic analyses indicate, however, that the change in the difference absorption at 455 nm (ΔA455) is not directly proportional to the reaction velocity. Furthermore, at a fixed concentration of the enzyme protein, the plot of the integrated amount of ΔA455 during the entire course of the reaction against the concentration of l-threonine is not linear, but rather a curve having two inflection points. On the other hand, at a fixed concentration of l-threonine, the integrated amount of ΔA455 is proportional to the enzyme concentration used. These results suggest that there is negative cooperativity among the enzyme subunits in the binding of the substrate and that the spectral change does not always reflect the obligatory intermediate in the enzyme reaction, but rather represents the substrate-induced interconversion of the enzyme species during the reaction. Accordingly, a new reaction scheme has been developed for the biodegradative threonine deaminase reaction, in which at high protein concentrations, almost all of the enzyme exist as an inactive form and l-threonine induces the conversion of this inactive enzyme into an active form, causing the spectral change of the enzyme-bound pyridoxal phosphate. A theoretical curve obtained from the rate equation derived from this scheme coincides well with the substrate saturation curve which has been experimentally determined."
