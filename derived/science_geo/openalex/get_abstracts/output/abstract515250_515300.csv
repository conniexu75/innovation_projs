https://openalex.org/W1973062929,"We use in situ Hi-C to probe the 3D architecture of genomes, constructing haploid and diploid maps of nine cell types. The densest, in human lymphoblastoid cells, contains 4.9 billion contacts, achieving 1 kb resolution. We find that genomes are partitioned into contact domains (median length, 185 kb), which are associated with distinct patterns of histone marks and segregate into six subcompartments. We identify ∼10,000 loops. These loops frequently link promoters and enhancers, correlate with gene activation, and show conservation across cell types and species. Loop anchors typically occur at domain boundaries and bind CTCF. CTCF sites at loop anchors occur predominantly (>90%) in a convergent orientation, with the asymmetric motifs ""facing"" one another. The inactive X chromosome splits into two massive domains and contains large loops anchored at CTCF-binding repeats."
https://openalex.org/W2042337609,"Transcript fusions as a result of chromosomal rearrangements have been a focus of attention in cancer as they provide attractive therapeutic targets. To identify novel fusion transcripts with the potential to be exploited therapeutically, we analyzed RNA sequencing, DNA copy number and gene mutation data from 4366 primary tumor samples. To avoid false positives, we implemented stringent quality criteria that included filtering of fusions detected in RNAseq data from 364 normal tissue samples. Our analysis identified 7887 high confidence fusion transcripts across 13 tumor types. Our fusion prediction was validated by evidence of a genomic rearrangement for 78 of 79 fusions in 48 glioma samples where whole-genome sequencing data were available. Cancers with higher levels of genomic instability showed a corresponding increase in fusion transcript frequency, whereas tumor samples harboring fusions contained statistically significantly fewer driver gene mutations, suggesting an important role for tumorigenesis. We identified at least one in-frame protein kinase fusion in 324 of 4366 samples (7.4%). Potentially druggable kinase fusions involving ALK, ROS, RET, NTRK and FGFR gene families were detected in bladder carcinoma (3.3%), glioblastoma (4.4%), head and neck cancer (1.0%), low-grade glioma (1.5%), lung adenocarcinoma (1.6%), lung squamous cell carcinoma (2.3%) and thyroid carcinoma (8.7%), suggesting a potential for application of kinase inhibitors across tumor types. In-frame fusion transcripts involving histone methyltransferase or histone demethylase genes were detected in 111 samples (2.5%) and may additionally be considered as therapeutic targets. In summary, we described the landscape of transcript fusions detected across a large number of tumor samples and revealed fusion events with clinical relevance that have not been previously recognized. Our results support the concept of basket clinical trials where patients are matched with experimental therapies based on their genomic profile rather than the tissue where the tumor originated."
https://openalex.org/W1972255859,"Cells control dynamic transitions in transcript levels by regulating transcription, processing, and/or degradation through an integrated regulatory strategy. Here, we combine RNA metabolic labeling, rRNA-depleted RNA-seq, and DRiLL, a novel computational framework, to quantify the level; editing sites; and transcription, processing, and degradation rates of each transcript at a splice junction resolution during the LPS response of mouse dendritic cells. Four key regulatory strategies, dominated by RNA transcription changes, generate most temporal gene expression patterns. Noncanonical strategies that also employ dynamic posttranscriptional regulation control only a minority of genes, but provide unique signal processing features. We validate Tristetraprolin (TTP) as a major regulator of RNA degradation in one noncanonical strategy. Applying DRiLL to the regulation of noncoding RNAs and to zebrafish embryogenesis demonstrates its broad utility. Our study provides a new quantitative approach to discover transcriptional and posttranscriptional events that control dynamic changes in transcript levels using RNA sequencing data."
https://openalex.org/W2002097805,"Transcriptome analysis of human brain provides fundamental insight into development and disease, but it largely relies on existing annotation. We sequenced transcriptomes of 72 prefrontal cortex samples across six life stages and identified 50,650 differentially expression regions (DERs) associated with developmental and aging, agnostic of annotation. While many DERs annotated to non-exonic sequence (41.1%), most were similarly regulated in cytosolic mRNA extracted from independent samples. The DERs were developmentally conserved across 16 brain regions and in the developing mouse cortex, and were expressed in diverse cell and tissue types. The DERs were further enriched for active chromatin marks and clinical risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia. Lastly, we demonstrate quantitatively that these DERs associate with a changing neuronal phenotype related to differentiation and maturation. These data show conserved molecular signatures of transcriptional dynamics across brain development, have potential clinical relevance and highlight the incomplete annotation of the human brain transcriptome."
https://openalex.org/W2070746836,"Aberrant regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is one of the major causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Loss-of-function mutations in APC are commonly found in CRC, leading to inappropriate activation of canonical Wnt signaling. Conversely, gain-of-function mutations in KRAS and BRAF genes are detected in up to 60% of CRCs. Whereas KRAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathways are critical for intestinal tumorigenesis, mechanisms integrating these two important signaling pathways during CRC development are unknown. Results herein demonstrate that transformation of normal intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) by oncogenic forms of KRAS, BRAF or MEK1 was associated with a marked increase in β-catenin/TCF4 and c-MYC promoter transcriptional activities and mRNA levels of c-Myc, Axin2 and Lef1. Notably, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of T-Cell Factor 4 (ΔNTCF4) severely attenuated IEC transformation induced by oncogenic MEK1 and markedly reduced their tumorigenic and metastatic potential in immunocompromised mice. Interestingly, the Frizzled co-receptor LRP6 was phosphorylated in a MEK-dependent manner in transformed IECs and in human CRC cell lines. Expression of LRP6 mutant in which serine/threonine residues in each particular ProlineProlineProlineSerine/ThreonineProline motif were mutated to alanines (LRP6-5A) significantly reduced β-catenin/TCF4 transcriptional activity. Accordingly, MEK inhibition in human CRC cells significantly diminished β-catenin/TCF4 transcriptional activity and c-MYC mRNA and protein levels without affecting β-catenin expression or stability. Lastly, LRP6 phosphorylation was also increased in human colorectal tumors, including adenomas, in comparison with healthy adjacent normal tissues. Our data indicate that oncogenic activation of KRAS/BRAF/MEK signaling stimulates the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which in turn promotes intestinal tumor growth and invasion. Moreover, LRP6 phosphorylation by ERK1/2 may provide a unique point of convergence between KRAS/MAPK and Wnt/β-catenin signalings during oncogenesis."

The primate brain has a limited capacity to process the immense amount of visual information entering the visual system at any given moment (Marois and Ivanoff, 2005Marois R. Ivanoff J. Capacity limits of information processing in the brain.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2005; 9: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Visual attention provides a solution to this problem by selecting behaviorally relevant information for detailed processing while filtering out distracting information (Petersen and Posner, 2012Petersen S.E.

J. Exp. Psychol. 1980; 32: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (7060) Google Scholar). In macaque monkeys, attention enhances the responses of visual neurons representing the sensory attributes of behaviorally relevant stimuli while suppressing the responses of neurons representing the attributes of irrelevant distractors (Desimone and Duncan, 1995Desimone R. Duncan J. Neural mechanisms of selective visual attention.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 193-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (5982) Google Scholar, Moran and Desimone, 1985Moran J. Desimone R.

During the voluntary allocation of attention, this response modulation is stronger and occurs earlier in the lateral prefrontal cortex relative to upstream striate and extrastriate visual areas (Buschman and Miller, 2007Buschman T.J.

Furthermore, activation (Moore and Fallah, 2004Moore T. Fallah M. Microstimulation of the frontal eye field and its effects on covert spatial attention.J.

Control of visual cortical signals by prefrontal dopamine.Nature. 2011; 474: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) of prefrontal neurons increases or decreases, respectively, the modulation of single-neuron activity in visual cortices. This suggests that the primate LPFC contains a saliency map influencing neuronal activity in visual cortical areas, thus playing an instrumental role in visual selective attention (Miller and Cohen, 2001Miller E.K. Cohen J.D. An integrative theory of prefrontal cortex function.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 167-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (8462) Google Scholar, Squire et al., 2013Squire R.F. Noudoost B.

Evidence for such a saliency map is mainly provided by studies that average the activity of single neurons over multiple repetitions of the same trial condition (Armstrong et al., 2009Armstrong K.M.

Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This across-trial averaging is performed in order to overcome the substantial amount of trial-to-trial variability in the responses of single neurons (Faisal et al., 2008Faisal A.A. Selen L.P.J. Wolpert D.M. Noise in the nervous system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 292-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar, Tolhurst et al., 1983Tolhurst D.J. Movshon J.A. Dean A.F.

Crapper D.R. Neuronal variability: non-stationary responses to identical visual stimuli.Brain Res. 1974; 79: 405-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This method, however, may not entirely reveal the ability of the prefrontal cortex to encode attentional signals in realistic environments where the brain must direct attention on a single-trial basis despite the variability of single-neuron responses. It is currently thought that the brain averages the activity of many neurons to overcome the variability of neuronal responses (Nienborg and Cumming, 2010Nienborg H. Cumming B.

A computational analysis of the relationship between neuronal and behavioral responses to visual motion.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1486-1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To account for this, previous studies have pooled single neurons’ activities recorded independently over different recording sessions into a neuronal group, sometimes referred to as a “neuronal population” (Astrand et al., 2014Astrand E. Enel P. Ibos G. Dominey P.F. Baraduc P. Ben Hamed S.

Dynamic coding for cognitive control in prefrontal cortex.Neuron. 2013; 78: 364-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). This procedure assumes that single neurons fire independently from one another and that the pooled activity of individual neurons recorded during different trials approximates the activity of the neuronal population on a single trial. This assumption, however, is probably unrealistic. Single neurons in many brain areas exhibit correlated firing (i.e., noise correlations) that can limit the efficacy of averaging and therefore affect the information content of the population (Averbeck et al., 2006aAverbeck B.B. Latham P.E. Pouget A. Neural correlations, population coding and computation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, Shadlen and Newsome, 1994Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T. Noise, neural codes and cortical organization.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Although the precise effects of these correlations on population coding are still unclear (Ecker et al., 2011Ecker A.S. Berens P. Tolias A.S. Bethge M.

Neurosci. 2012; 35: 463-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), they seem to play an important role in visual attention (Cohen and Maunsell, 2009Cohen M.R. Maunsell J.H.R.

Spatial attention decorrelates intrinsic activity fluctuations in macaque area V4.Neuron. 2009; 63: 879-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a realistic estimate of population responses can be obtained by simultaneously recording from a group of neurons, referred to as a neuronal ensemble (Buzsáki, 2004Buzsáki G. Large-scale recording of neuronal ensembles.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, Hebb, 1949Hebb D.O. The Organization of Behavior. Wiley & Sons, New York1949Google Scholar). In the primate prefrontal cortex, however, few studies have recorded from neuronal ensembles in order to understand the population dynamics underlying visual attention (Buschman and Miller, 2009Buschman T.J. Miller E.K. Serial, covert shifts of attention during visual search are reflected by the frontal eye fields and correlated with population oscillations.Neuron. 2009; 63: 386-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, Cohen et al., 2010Cohen J.Y.

Difficulty of visual search modulates neuronal interactions and response variability in the frontal eye field.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 2580-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Currently, whether prefrontal neuronal ensembles can encode the allocation of visual attention on a single-trial basis despite response variability and correlated firing is unclear. To investigate this issue, we chronically implanted multielectrode arrays in area 8A of two macaque monkeys. Area 8A is a cytoarchitectonically defined granular region of the LPFC located on the prearcuate convexity, anterior to the frontal eye fields (FEF) and posterior to area 9/46 (Petrides, 2005Petrides M. Lateral prefrontal cortex: architectonic and functional organization.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 781-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Neurons in this area have particularly strong attentional signals that are independent of eye movements, have attentional fields spanning both visual hemifields, and lead to specific attentional deficits when lesioned (Johnston et al., 2009Johnston K.

B Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 781-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). We recorded the activity of neuronal ensembles in area 8A while the animals performed a standard attentional task. From the ensemble activity, we could accurately decode the focus of attention on a single-trial basis. Additionally, we found that correlated firing between similarly tuned neurons was detrimental to the decoding of attention. Moreover, the decoding was resilient to transient distractors, predictive of behavioral outcomes, and stable across weeks of chronic recordings. Two monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) performed a visual attention task while we recorded from neuronal ensembles in their left LPFC area 8A (Figure 1). The animals were instructed to covertly attend to one out of four identical Gabor stimuli, to detect a subtle change in its orientation, and to saccade to it within 400 ms of the change to obtain a juice reward (Figure 1A). The target Gabor was cued by appearing 363 ms before the other three distractors. After a variable delay period, orientation changes could happen in either the target (“Target” trials) or in the opposite distractor (“Distractor” trials). In the latter case, the monkey had to ignore the transiently changing distractor and maintain fixation on the center dot until the end of the trial. In a third trial type, orientation changes happened simultaneously both in the target and in the opposite distractor, in which case the monkey had to saccade to the target and ignore the transient distractor (“Target + Distractor” trials). Within a given session, all three trial types were randomly interleaved, so that it was impossible for the animals to (1) predict the location of the target, (2) know whether or not a saccade would be required, and (3) know whether the change would happen in the target or in a distractor stimuli or in both. Both monkeys performed above chance in all trial types: “Target,” “Target + Distractor” (both ∼80% hit rate, including fixation breaks), and “Distractor” (∼60%; Figure 1B). The performance in the latter condition was lower because in some trials the monkeys made a saccade to the distractor change. Importantly, this was not due to the animals ignoring the cue and saccading to any stimulus change. In the latter scenario, the performance in the “Target + Distractor” trials would have been 50% and the performance in the “Distractor” trials would have been 0%. Further supporting that the animals allocated attention to the cued location, saccades to the distractor change had longer latencies than saccades to the target change (Figure 1C). We recorded the activity of neuronal ensembles in area 8A of each monkey’s left LPFC using a chronically implanted 96-channel multielectrode array (Figures 1D, 1E, and S1). We isolated action potentials from single neurons and multiunit clusters using standard thresholding and spike-sorting techniques (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online). We refer to both single units and multiunit clusters when using the general term “unit.” We found units tuned for the spatial position of each one of the four possible targets, although a larger proportion of units preferred targets in the hemifield contralateral to the implant (70% contralateral versus 30% ipsilateral; Figure 1E and Supplemental Information). In agreement with previous studies (Lebedev et al., 2004Lebedev M.A. Messinger A. Kralik J.D. Wise S.P.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 9520-9529Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), many units within the recorded ensembles showed a sustained increase in firing rate that was selective for the spatial allocation of attention to the target stimulus (Figures 1F and S2). This sustained increase in responses is a signature of visual attention at the single-cell level (Moran and Desimone, 1985Moran J. Desimone R.

Feature-based attention influences motion processing gain in macaque visual cortex.Nature. 1999; 399: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) and corroborates that the animals attended to the target during the delay period. The activity of each neuronal ensemble (mean [M] = 52 simultaneously recorded units, standard deviation [SD] = 7, 23 recording sessions) was inputted to a decoding algorithm capable of making single-trial predictions about both external (e.g., stimulus location) and internal (e.g., attention allocation) variables. Figure 2A depicts four example single-trial ensemble activities from the same recording session, one for each attended location. Although the exact nature of the neuronal code used by these prefrontal neuronal ensembles remains unknown, it has recently been suggested that state-of-the-art decoders such as support vector machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995Cortes C. Vapnik V. Support-vector networks.Mach. Learn. 1995; 20: 273-297Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar) might be best suited to extract the multidimensional information coded by ensembles of simultaneously recorded LPFC neurons (Astrand et al., 2014Astrand E. Enel P. Ibos G. Dominey P.F. Baraduc P. Ben Hamed S. Comparison of classifiers for decoding sensory and cognitive information from prefrontal neuronal populations.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e86314Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, Rigotti et al., 2013Rigotti M.

As such, we used a SVM decoder to predict the target location during the various epochs of a trial (LIBSVM v.3.14) (Chang and Lin, 2011Chang C.-C. Lin C.-J. LIBSVM: A Library for Support Vector Machines.ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology. 2011; 2Crossref Scopus (25442) Google Scholar). Throughout the article, we refer to the cue (1), attention (2), or saccade (3) epochs and extract the corresponding single-trial average decoding accuracies. The decoder’s accuracy was assessed using a standard cross-validation procedure by iteratively training the decoder on 4/5 of trials and testing its predictions in the remaining 1/5 of trials (K-fold = 5). Confusion matrices of the decoder’s misclassifications were obtained to identify potential error patterns. Chance performance was determined by a permutation test that shuffles trial labels of the training set (see Supplemental Information for more details on the decoding procedure). In order to make single-trial predictions about the cue position, the allocation of attention, and the saccade endpoint, we trained and tested the decoder at different time points during correct “Target” trials. We used different time windows to integrate the firing rate of units in the ensembles, from 20 to 800 ms. The decoder gave classification performances significantly above chance in all epochs using windows equal to or longer than 80 ms (see Figure S3). Figure 2B shows the classifier performance using two time windows, 100 (dashed red line) and 400 ms (full red line). In both scenarios the performance was significantly higher than chance (25%). For further analyses, we used the larger 400 ms window because it provided a good compromise between decoding speed and accuracy (see Figure S3). Across all recording sessions, we found that the decoder achieved higher than chance accuracy in predicting: (1) the cue position (M = 82%, 95% confidence interval of the mean [CI] = 72%–92%, paired t test, p < 0.001), (2) the allocation of attention (M = 74%, CI = 65%–83%, paired t test, p < 0.001), and (3) the saccade endpoint (M = 98%, CI = 97%–99%, paired t test, p < 0.001) (Figure 2B, red line). Following cue offset, decoding accuracy reached a constant level throughout the attention epoch (∼1–2 s long), a result likely attributable to the sustained activity of units encoding the attended target location (Figures 1F, 2A, and S2). These results indicate that LPFC neuronal ensembles can select a visual target among distractors within timeframes of a few hundred milliseconds. Attention is known to have various modulatory effects on the signal-to-noise ratio of neuronal activity, including increases in firing rate (Everling et al., 2002Everling S. Tinsley C.J. Gaffan D. Duncan J. Filtering of neural signals by focused attention in the monkey prefrontal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), decreases in Fano factor (Mitchell et al., 2007Mitchell J.F. Sundberg K.A. Reynolds J.H.

Gotts S.J. Zhou H. Desimone R. High-frequency, long-range coupling between prefrontal and visual cortex during attention.Science. 2009; 324: 1207-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, Womelsdorf et al., 2006Womelsdorf T. Fries P. Mitra P.P. Desimone R. Gamma-band synchronization in visual cortex predicts speed of change detection.Nature. 2006; 439: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). These effects have been documented using single-electrode recording methods. More recently, some studies have recorded from neuronal ensembles in the extrastriate visual area V4 and reported that attention improves performance primarily by reducing noise correlations between neurons (Cohen and Maunsell, 2009Cohen M.R. Maunsell J.H.R. Attention improves performance primarily by reducing interneuronal correlations.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, Mitchell et al., 2009Mitchell J.F. Sundberg K.A. Reynolds J.H. Spatial attention decorrelates intrinsic activity fluctuations in macaque area V4.Neuron. 2009; 63: 879-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). However, whether noise correlations are always detrimental to neuronal ensemble encoding is still being debated theoretically (Ecker et al., 2011Ecker A.S. Berens P. Tolias A.S. Bethge M. The effect of noise correlations in populations of diversely tuned neurons.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 14272-14283Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, Nienborg et al., 2012Nienborg H. Cohen M.R. Cumming B.G. Decision-related activity in sensory neurons: correlations among neurons and with behavior.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 463-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It has recently been suggested that combining simultaneous recordings with decoding methods can reveal whether noise correlations truly limit the information coding capabilities of a neuronal population (Moreno-Bote et al., 2014Moreno-Bote R. Beck J. Kanitscheider I. Pitkow X. Latham P. Pouget A. Information-limiting correlations.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1410-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). To investigate this issue, we quantified noise correlations between neurons in the recorded neuronal ensembles. Figure 2C illustrates correlations between simultaneously recorded units in two example sessions. Lines represent statistically significant correlations between pairs of units corresponding to different electrodes (p < 0.05). Most correlations were positive and small (Figure 2C; white lines). We also quantified changes in noise correlations during attentional selection of each possible target compared to a passive fixation (Figure 2D). The distribution of noise correlations between all possible pairs of units within a neuronal ensemble was different during attention compared to fixation (p < 0.05, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test) and depended on which target attention was allocated to (Monkey “F”: p < 1"
https://openalex.org/W2029614054,"Recent advances in cancer biology have emerged important roles for microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating tumor responses. However, their function in mediating intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment is thus far poorly explored. Here, we found miR-206 to be abrogated in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) specimens and cell lines. We show that miR-206 directly targets the oncogenes KRAS and annexin a2 (ANXA2), thereby acting as tumor suppressor in PDAC cells by blocking cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Importantly, we identified miR-206 as a negative regulator of oncogenic KRAS-induced nuclear factor-κB transcriptional activity, resulting in a concomitant reduction of the expression and secretion of pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory factors including the cytokine interleukin-8, the chemokines (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 and (C–C motif) ligand 2, and the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. We further show that miR-206 abrogates the expression and secretion of the potent pro-lymphangiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor C in pancreatic cancer cells through an NF-κB-independent mechanism. By using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we reveal that re-expression of miR-206 in PDAC cells is sufficient to inhibit tumor blood and lymphatic vessel formation, thus leading to a significant delay of tumor growth and progression. Taken together, our study sheds light onto the role of miR-206 as a pleiotropic modulator of different hallmarks of cancer, and as such raising the intriguing possibility that miR-206 may be an attractive candidate for miRNA-based anticancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2076413516,"Mechanical and thermal activation of ion channels is central to touch, thermosensation, and pain. The TRAAK/TREK K2P potassium channel subfamily produces background currents that alter neuronal excitability in response to pressure, temperature, signaling lipids, and anesthetics. How such diverse stimuli control channel function is unclear. Here we report structures of K2P4.1 (TRAAK) bearing C-type gate-activating mutations that reveal a tilting and straightening of the M4 inner transmembrane helix and a buckling of the M2 transmembrane helix. These conformational changes move M4 in a direction opposite to that in classical potassium channel activation mechanisms and open a passage lateral to the pore that faces the lipid bilayer inner leaflet. Together, our findings uncover a unique aspect of K2P modulation, indicate a means for how the K2P C-terminal cytoplasmic domain affects the C-type gate which lies ∼40Å away, and suggest how lipids and bilayer inner leaflet deformations may gate the channel."
https://openalex.org/W2114772731,"In humans, shift work induces a desynchronization between the circadian system and the outside world, which contributes to shift work-associated medical disorders. Using a simulated night shift experiment, we previously showed that 3 d of bright light at night fully synchronize the central clock to the inverted sleep schedule, whereas the peripheral clocks located in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) took longer to reset. This underlines the need for testing the effects of synchronizers on both the central and peripheral clocks. Glucocorticoids display circadian rhythms controlled by the central clock and are thought to act as synchronizers of rodent peripheral clocks. In the present study, we tested whether the human central and peripheral clocks were sensitive to exogenous glucocorticoids (Cortef) administered in the late afternoon. We showed that 20 mg Cortef taken orally acutely increased PER1 expression in PBMC peripheral clocks. After 6 d of Cortef administration, the phases of central markers were not affected, whereas those of PER2-3 and BMAL1 expression in PBMCs were shifted by ∼ 9.5-11.5 h. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that human peripheral clocks are entrained by glucocorticoids. Importantly, they suggest innovative interventions for shift workers and jet-lag travelers, combining synchronizing agents for the central and peripheral clocks."
https://openalex.org/W1984525171,"The authors show that mice lacking the gene Erbb4 in somatostatin-expressing (SOM) neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) show selective behavioral deficits in tasks involving switching attention between cues of different sensory modalities. Slice recordings also showed enhanced cortical drive in Erbb4-deficient TRN SOM neurons. Selective processing of behaviorally relevant sensory inputs against irrelevant ones is a fundamental cognitive function whose impairment has been implicated in major psychiatric disorders. It is known that the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) gates sensory information en route to the cortex, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show in mice that deficiency of the Erbb4 gene in somatostatin-expressing TRN neurons markedly alters behaviors that are dependent on sensory selection. Whereas the performance of the Erbb4-deficient mice in identifying targets from distractors was improved, their ability to switch attention between conflicting sensory cues was impaired. These behavioral changes were mediated by an enhanced cortical drive onto the TRN that promotes the TRN-mediated cortical feedback inhibition of thalamic neurons. Our results uncover a previously unknown role of ErbB4 in regulating cortico-TRN-thalamic circuit function. We propose that ErbB4 sets the sensitivity of the TRN to cortical inputs at levels that can support sensory selection while allowing behavioral flexibility."
https://openalex.org/W2034586402,"Background There is increasing evidence that chronic inflammation is an important determinant in insulin resistance and in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). MicroRNAs constitute a newly discovered system of cell regulation and in particular two microRNAs (miR-146a and miR-155) have been described as regulators and biomarkers of inflammation. Aim To determine a putative association between the levels of miR-146a and miR-155 in serum of T2D patients, clinical parameters and serological indicators of inflammation. Methods We performed quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR) of microRNAs from serum (56 Ecuadorian T2D ambulatory patients and 40 non-diabetic controls). In addition, we evaluated T2D-related serum cytokines.chemokines and growth factors using a commercially available multi-analyte cytometric bead array system. We correlated outcomes to clinical parameters, including BMI, HbA1c and lipid state. Results The Ecuadorian non-diabetic controls appeared as overweight (BMI>25: patients 85%, controls 82.5%) and as dyslipidemic (hypercholesterolemia: patients 60.7%, controls 67.5%) as the patients. The serum levels of miR-146a were significantly reduced in T2D patients as compared to these non-diabetic, but obese/dyslipidemic control group (mean patients 0.61, mean controls set at 1; p = 0.042), those of miR-155 were normal. The serum levels of both microRNAs correlated to each other (r = 0.478; p<0.001) and to leptin levels. The microRNAs did not correlate to BMI, glycemia and dyslipidemia. From the tested cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, we found IL-8 and HGF significantly raised in T2D patients versus non-diabetic controls (p = 0.011 and 0.023 respectively). Conclusions This study shows decreased serum anti-inflammatory miR-146a, increased pro-inflammatory IL-8 and increased HGF (a vascular/insular repair factor) as discriminating markers of failure of glucose control occurring on the background of obesity and dyslipidemia."
https://openalex.org/W2048374819,"Excitatory glutamatergic synapses at dendritic spines exchange and modulate their receptor content via lateral membrane diffusion. Several studies have shown that the thin spine neck impedes the access of membrane and solute molecules to the spine head. However, it is unclear whether the spine neck geometry alone restricts access to dendritic spines or if a physical barrier to the diffusion of molecules exists. Here, we investigated whether a complex of septin cytoskeletal GTPases localized at the base of the spine neck regulates diffusion across the spine neck. We found that, during development, a marker of the septin complex, Septin7 (Sept7), becomes localized to the spine neck where it forms a stable structure underneath the plasma membrane. We show that diffusion of receptors and bulk membrane, but not cytoplasmic proteins, is slower in spines bearing Sept7 at their neck. Finally, when Sept7 expression was suppressed by RNA interference, membrane molecules explored larger membrane areas. Our findings indicate that Sept7 regulates membrane protein access to spines."
https://openalex.org/W2069916815,"There is controversy over the role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) in cancer progression. Recent work has implicated GSK-3 in the regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a known player in malignant transformation. Autophagy, a self-degradation pathway, is inhibited by mTOR and is tightly associated with cell survival and tumor growth. Here we show that GSK-3 suppresses autophagy via mTOR complex-1 (mTORC1) and lysosomal regulation. We show that overexpression of GSK-3 isoforms (GSK-3α and GSK-3β) activated mTORC1 and suppressed autophagy in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells as indicated by reduced beclin-1 levels and upregulation of sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1). Further, overexpression of GSK-3 increased the number of autophagosomes and inhibited autophagic flux. This activity was directly related to reduced lysosomal acidification triggered by GSK-3 (in which GSK-3β has a stronger impact). We found that lysosomal acidification is reduced in MCF-7 cells that also exhibit increased levels of autophagosomes and p62/SQSTM1 and increased activity of mTORC1. Subsequently, treating cells with GSK-3 inhibitors restored lysosomal acidification, enhanced autophagic flux and inhibited mTORC1. Furthermore, GSK-3 inhibitors inhibited cell proliferation. We provide evidence that GSK3-mediated mTORC1 activity and GSK-3-mediated lysosomal acidification occur via distinct pathways, yet both mTORC1 and lysosomes control cell growth. Finally, we show that GSK-3-reduced lysosomal acidification inhibits endocytic clearance as demonstrated by reduced endocytic degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Taken together, our study places GSK-3 as a key regulator coordinating cellular homeostasis. GSK-3 inhibitors may be useful in targeting mTORC1 and lysosomal acidification for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2075304876,"In normal colon, claudin-7 is one of the highly expressed claudin proteins and its knockdown in mice results in altered epithelial cell homeostasis and neonatal death. Notably, dysregulation of the epithelial homeostasis potentiates oncogenic transformation and growth. However, the role of claudin-7 in the regulation of colon tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. Using a large colorectal cancer (CRC) patient database and mouse models of colon cancer, we found claudin-7 expression to be significantly downregulated in cancer samples. Most notably, forced claudin-7 expression in poorly differentiated and highly metastatic SW620 colon cancer cells induced epithelial characteristics and inhibited their growth in soft agar and tumor growth in vivo. By contrast, knockdown of claudin-7 in HT-29 or DLD-1 cells induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), colony formation, xenograft-tumor growth in athymic mice and invasion. Importantly, a claudin-7 signature gene profile generated by overlapping the DEGs (differentially expressed genes in a high-throughput transcriptome analysis using claudin-7-manipulated cells) with human claudin-7 signature genes identified high-risk CRC patients. Furthermore, Rab25, a colon cancer suppressor and regulator of the polarized cell trafficking constituted one of the highly upregulated DEGs in claudin-7 overexpressing cells. Notably, silencing of Rab25 expression counteracted the effects of claudin-7 expression and not only increased proliferation and cell invasion but also increased the expression of p-Src and mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 that were suppressed upon claudin-7 overexpression. Of interest, CRC cell lines, which exhibited decreased claudin-7 expression, also exhibited promoter DNA hypermethylation, a modification associated with transcriptional silencing. Taken together, our data demonstrate a previously undescribed role of claudin-7 as a colon cancer suppressor and suggest that loss of claudin-7 potentiates EMT to promote colon cancer, in a manner dependent on Rab25."
https://openalex.org/W2012625125,"Background Diminished control of standing balance, traditionally indicated by greater postural sway magnitude and speed, is associated with falls in older adults. Tai Chi (TC) is a multisystem intervention that reduces fall risk, yet its impact on sway measures vary considerably. We hypothesized that TC improves the integrated function of multiple control systems influencing balance, quantifiable by the multi-scale “complexity” of postural sway fluctuations. Objectives To evaluate both traditional and complexity-based measures of sway to characterize the short- and potential long-term effects of TC training on postural control and the relationships between sway measures and physical function in healthy older adults. Methods A cross-sectional comparison of standing postural sway in healthy TC-naïve and TC-expert (24.5±12 yrs experience) adults. TC-naïve participants then completed a 6-month, two-arm, wait-list randomized clinical trial of TC training. Postural sway was assessed before and after the training during standing on a force-plate with eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC). Anterior-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) sway speed, magnitude, and complexity (quantified by multiscale entropy) were calculated. Single-legged standing time and Timed-Up–and-Go tests characterized physical function. Results At baseline, compared to TC-naïve adults (n = 60, age 64.5±7.5 yrs), TC-experts (n = 27, age 62.8±7.5 yrs) exhibited greater complexity of sway in the AP EC (P = 0.023), ML EO (P<0.001), and ML EC (P<0.001) conditions. Traditional measures of sway speed and magnitude were not significantly lower among TC-experts. Intention-to-treat analyses indicated no significant effects of short-term TC training; however, increases in AP EC and ML EC complexity amongst those randomized to TC were positively correlated with practice hours (P = 0.044, P = 0.018). Long- and short-term TC training were positively associated with physical function. Conclusion Multiscale entropy offers a complementary approach to traditional COP measures for characterizing sway during quiet standing, and may be more sensitive to the effects of TC in healthy adults.

https://openalex.org/W4210339143,"Drosophila optic lobe neurons are generated from the outer and inner proliferation centers (IPC). The authors show a new mode of neurogenesis in which progenitors in one IPC domain migrate to a second domain where they mature into neural stem cells/neuroblasts. They also identify several genes that regulate this process. Brain areas each generate specific neuron subtypes during development. However, underlying regional variations in neurogenesis strategies and regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. In Drosophila, neurons in four optic lobe ganglia originate from two neuroepithelia, the outer (OPC) and inner (IPC) proliferation centers. Using genetic manipulations, we found that one IPC neuroepithelial domain progressively transformed into migratory progenitors that matured into neural stem cells (neuroblasts) in a second domain. Progenitors emerged by an epithelial-mesenchymal transition–like mechanism that required the Snail-family member Escargot and, in subdomains, Decapentaplegic signaling. The proneural factors Lethal of scute and Asense differentially controlled progenitor supply and maturation into neuroblasts. These switched expression from Asense to a third proneural protein, Atonal. Dichaete and Tailless mediated this transition, which was essential for generating two neuron populations at defined positions. We propose that this neurogenesis mode is central for setting up a new proliferative zone to facilitate spatio-temporal matching of neurogenesis and connectivity across ganglia."
https://openalex.org/W2046809316,"Deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are required to mitigate climate change. However, there is low willingness amongst the public to prioritise climate policies for reducing emissions. Here we show that the extent to which Australians are prepared to reduce their country's CO2 emissions is greater when the costs to future national income are framed as a ""foregone-gain""--incomes rise in the future but not by as much as in the absence of emission cuts--rather than as a ""loss""--incomes decrease relative to the baseline expected future levels (Studies 1 & 2). The provision of a normative message identifying Australia as one of the world's largest CO2 emitters did not increase the amount by which individuals were prepared to reduce emissions (Study 1), whereas a normative message revealing the emission policy preferences of other Australians did (Study 2). The results suggest that framing the costs of reducing emissions as a smaller increase in future income and communicating normative information about others' emission policy preferences are effective methods for leveraging public support for emission cuts."
https://openalex.org/W2085012903,"Background A relevant fraction of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) exhibit a fronto-temporal pattern of cognitive and behavioural disturbances with pronounced deficits in executive functioning and cognitive control of behaviour. Structural imaging shows a decline in fronto-temporal brain areas, but most brain imaging studies did not evaluate cognitive status. We investigated microstructural white matter changes underlying cognitive impairment using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a large cohort of ALS patients. Methods We assessed 72 non-demented ALS patients and 65 matched healthy control subjects using a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and DTI. We compared DTI measures of fiber tract integrity using tract-based spatial statistics among ALS patients with and without cognitive impairment and healthy controls. Neuropsychological performance and behavioural measures were correlated with DTI measures. Results Patients without cognitive impairment demonstrated white matter changes predominantly in motor tracts, including the corticospinal tract and the body of corpus callosum. Those with impairments (ca. 30%) additionally presented significant white matter alterations in extra-motor regions, particularly the frontal lobe. Executive and memory performance and behavioural measures were correlated with fiber tract integrity in large association tracts. Conclusion In non-demented cognitively impaired ALS patients, white matter changes measured by DTI are related to disturbances of executive and memory functions, including prefrontal and temporal regions. In a group comparison, DTI is able to observe differences between cognitively unimpaired and impaired ALS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2064960387,"Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) continues to be a major clinical problem and the mechanisms behind it remain unclear. Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5 (TXNDC5) is involved in protein folding and chaperone activity, and its overexpression has been reported in multiple malignancies. In the current study, we demonstrated that TXNDC5 is up-regulated following long-term androgen-deprivation treatment (ADT) and is highly overexpressed in CRPC tumors compared with hormone-naive prostate cancer (PCa) cases. Functionally, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that TXNDC5 overexpression promotes the growth of both androgen-dependent and castration-resistant PCa xenografts. Mechanistically, TXNDC5 directly interacts with the AR protein to increase its stability and thus enhances its transcriptional activity. TXDNC5-mediated CRPC growth can be fully abolished by AR inhibition, suggesting TXDNC5 up-regulation as an escape pathway for aberrant AR re-activation and CRPC growth in the milieu of low androgen. Indeed, we found that TXNDC5 is increased by ADT-induced hypoxia through HIF-1α in an miR-200b-dependent manner. Overall, we defined an important role of TXNDC5 in CRPC and further investigations are needed to screen TXNDC5 antagonists as a novel therapeutic approaches to treat PCa patients with CRPC."

A total of 67,325 mites representing 4 genera and 14 species were collected from 783 trapped rodents, corresponding to a chigger index (number of chigger mites per rodent) of 86.0. The predominant mite species were Leptotrombidium pallidum (52.6%), Leptotrombiduim scutellare (27.1%), Leptotrombidium palpale (8.2%), Leptotrombidium orientale (5.6%), and Neotrombicula tamiyai (1.7%). However, the proportions of L. scutellare in southern areas, including endemic provinces such as Jeollabuk-Do (34.3%), Jeollanam-Do (49.0%), and Gyeongsangnam-Do (88%), were relatively higher than in central Korean regions where L. pallidum was predominant. In autumn, the ratio of L. scutellare increased to 42% while the ratio of L. pallidum decreased. The geographical distribution map of the L. scutellare chigger index was identical to the incidence pattern of scrub typhus, whereas those of overall mites and L. pallidum showed no relationship with case incidence patterns. Distribution mapping analysis shows an identical geographical distribution of L. scutellare and epidemic incidence of scrub typhus in South Korea. L. pallidum could be another vector at all other parts of the Korean peninsula, including the eastern and northern regions that have a low level of scrub typhus incidence."
https://openalex.org/W2078611782,"There is a concern on how emerging pests and diseases will affect the distribution range and adaptability of their host species, especially due to different conditions derived from climate change and growing globalization. Fusarium circinatum, which causes pitch canker disease in Pinus species, is an exotic pathogen of recent introduction in Spain that threatens its maritime pine (P. pinaster) stands. To predict the impact this disease will have on the species, we examine host resistance traits and their genetic architecture. Resistance phenotyping was done in a clonal provenance/progeny trial, using three-year-old cuttings artificially inoculated with the pathogen and maintained under controlled environmental conditions. A total number of 670 ramets were assessed, distributed in 10 populations, with a total of 47 families, 2 to 5 half-sibs per family, and 3–7 ramets per clone. High genetic variation was found at the three hierarchical levels studied: population, family and clone, being both additive and non-additive effects important. Narrow-sense and broad-sense heritability estimates were relatively high, with respective values of 0.43–0.58 and 0.51–0.8, depending on the resistance traits measured (lesion length, lesion length rate, time to wilting, and survival). These values suggest the species' high capacity of evolutionary response to the F. circinatum pathogen. A population originated in Northern Spain was the most resistant, while another from Morocco was the most susceptible. The total number of plants that did not show lesion development or presented a small lesion (length<30 mm) was 224 out of 670, indicating a high proportion of resistant trees in the offspring within the analyzed populations. We found large differences among populations and considerable genetic variation within populations, which should allow, through natural or artificial selection, the successful adaptation of maritime pine to pitch canker disease."
https://openalex.org/W2056056779,"We describe a novel approach named REAL-Select for the non-covalent display of IgG-molecules on the surface of yeast cells for the purpose of antibody engineering and selection. It relies on the capture of secreted native full-length antibodies on the cell surface via binding to an externally immobilized ZZ domain, which tightly binds antibody Fc. It is beneficial for high-throughput screening of yeast-displayed IgG-libraries during antibody discovery and development. In a model experiment, antibody-displaying yeast cells were isolated from a 1:1,000,000 mixture with control cells confirming the maintenance of genotype-phenotype linkage. Antibodies with improved binding characteristics were obtained by affinity maturation using REAL-Select, demonstrating the ability of this system to display antibodies in their native form and to detect subtle changes in affinity by flow cytometry. The biotinylation of the cell surface followed by functionalization with a streptavidin-ZZ fusion protein is an approach that is independent of the genetic background of the antibody-producing host and therefore can be expected to be compatible with other eukaryotic expression hosts such as P. pastoris or mammalian cells."

Methods In 2012, we conducted a survey to capture information on pharmaceuticals and other facility indicators from over 200 facilities in each country. We analyze data on the availability of pharmaceuticals and quantify its association with various facility-level indicators. We analyze both availability of essential medicines, as defined by the various essential medicine lists (EMLs) of each respective country, and availability of all surveyed pharmaceuticals deemed important for treatment of various high-burden diseases, including those on the EMLs. Results We find that there is heterogeneity with respect to availability across the three countries with Ghana generally having better availability than Uganda and Kenya. To analyze the relationship between facility-level factors and pharmaceutical stock-out we use a binomial regression model. We find that the factors associated with stock-out vary by country, but across all countries both presence of a laboratory at the facility and presence of a vehicle at the facility are significantly associated with reduced stock-out. Conclusion The results of this study highlight the poor availability of essential medicines across these three countries and suggest more needs to be done to strengthen the supply system so that stock remains uninterrupted."
https://openalex.org/W2106041976,"We characterized Teth514_1788 and Teth514_1789, belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 130, from Thermoanaerobacter sp. X-514. These two enzymes catalyzed the synthesis of 1,2-β-oligomannan using β-1,2-mannobiose and d-mannose as the optimal acceptors, respectively, in the presence of the donor α-d-mannose 1-phosphate. Kinetic analysis of the phosphorolytic reaction toward 1,2-β-oligomannan revealed that these enzymes followed a typical sequential Bi Bi mechanism. The kinetic parameters of the phosphorolysis of 1,2-β-oligomannan indicate that Teth514_1788 and Teth514_1789 prefer 1,2-β-oligomannans containing a DP ≥3 and β-1,2-Man2, respectively. These results indicate that the two enzymes are novel inverting phosphorylases that exhibit distinct chain-length specificities toward 1,2-β-oligomannan. Here, we propose 1,2-β-oligomannan:phosphate α-d-mannosyltransferase as the systematic name and 1,2-β-oligomannan phosphorylase as the short name for Teth514_1788 and β-1,2-mannobiose:phosphate α-d-mannosyltransferase as the systematic name and β-1,2-mannobiose phosphorylase as the short name for Teth514_1789."
https://openalex.org/W2014886405,"The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a multifunctional endocytic receptor abundantly expressed in neurons. Increasing evidence demonstrates that LRP1 regulates synaptic integrity and function at the post synapses, at least partially by regulating glutamate receptors. The α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) are critical ionotropic glutamate receptors consisting of homotetramer or heterotetramer of GluA1-4 subunits and play an essential role in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. Our previous work has shown that neuronal deletion of the Lrp1 gene in mice leads to decreased level of GluA1 and reduced long-term potentiation. To understand the underlying mechanism, we investigated the cellular and functional consequences of LRP1 deletion in primary neurons. Here, we show that LRP1 interacts with and regulates the cellular distribution and turnover of GluA1. LRP1 knockdown in mouse primary neurons led to accelerated turnover and decreased cell surface distribution of GluA1, which correspond to decreased phosphorylation of GluA1 at S845 and S831 sites. Decreased LRP1 expression also attenuated AMPA-evoked calcium influx and reduced GluA1-regulated neurite outgrowth and filopodia density. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which LRP1 controls synaptic integrity and function, specifically by regulating GluA1 trafficking, phosphorylation and turnover. They further demonstrate that LRP1-GluA1 pathway may hold promises as a therapeutic target for restoring synaptic functions in neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1965170694,"Salmonids are generally considered to have a robust genetic sex determination system with a simple male heterogamety (XX/XY). However, spontaneous masculinization of XX females has been found in a rainbow trout population of gynogenetic doubled haploid individuals. The analysis of this masculinization phenotype transmission supported the hypothesis of the involvement of a recessive mutation (termed mal). As temperature effect on sex differentiation has been reported in some salmonid species, in this study we investigated in detail the potential implication of temperature on masculinization in this XX mal-carrying population. Seven families issued from XX mal-carrying parents were exposed from the time of hatching to different rearing water temperatures ((8, 12 and 18°C), and the resulting sex-ratios were confirmed by histological analysis of both gonads. Our results demonstrate that masculinization rates are strongly increased (up to nearly two fold) at the highest temperature treatment (18°C). Interestingly, we also found clear differences between temperatures on the masculinization of the left versus the right gonads with the right gonad consistently more often masculinized than the left one at lower temperatures (8 and 12°C). However, the masculinization rate is also strongly dependent on the genetic background of the XX mal-carrying families. Thus, masculinization in XX mal-carrying rainbow trout is potentially triggered by an interaction between the temperature treatment and a complex genetic background potentially involving some part of the genetic sex differentiation regulatory cascade along with some minor sex-influencing loci. These results indicate that despite its rather strict genetic sex determinism system, rainbow trout sex differentiation can be modulated by temperature, as described in many other fish species."
https://openalex.org/W2002692693,"Infections with human rhinovirus (HRV) are commonly associated with acute upper and lower respiratory tract disease and asthma exacerbations. The role that HRVs play in these diseases suggests it is important to understand host-specific or virus-specific factors that contribute to pathogenesis. Since species A HRVs are often associated with more serious HRV disease than species B HRVs, differences in immune responses they induce should inform disease pathogenesis. To identify species differences in induced responses, we evaluated 3 species A viruses, HRV 25, 31 and 36 and 3 species B viruses, HRV 4, 35 and 48 by exposing human PBMCs to HRV infected Calu-3 cells. To evaluate the potential effect of memory induced by previous HRV infection on study responses, we tested cord blood mononuclear cells that should be HRV naïve. There were HRV-associated increases (significant increase compared to mock-infected cells) for one or more HRVs for IP-10 and IL-15 that was unaffected by addition of PBMCs, for MIP-1α, MIP-1β, IFN-α, and HGF only with addition of PBMCs, and for ENA-78 only without addition of PBMCs. All three species B HRVs induced higher levels, compared to A HRVs, of MIP-1α and MIP-1β with PBMCs and ENA-78 without PBMCs. In contrast, addition of CBMCs had less effect and did not induce MIP-1α, MIP-1β, or IFN-α nor block ENA-78 production. Addition of CBMCs did, however, increase IP-10 levels for HRV 35 and HRV 36 infection. The presence of an effect with PBMCs and no effect with CBMCs for some responses suggest differences between the two types of cells possibly because of the presence of HRV memory responses in PBMCs and not CBMCs or limited response capacity for the immature CBMCs relative to PBMCs. Thus, our results indicate that different HRV strains can induce different patterns of cytokines and chemokines; some of these differences may be due to differences in memory responses induced by past HRV infections, and other differences related to virus factors that can inform disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2063172951,"Tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF) proteins are involved in the genesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We examined the association of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the TNFSF15 gene with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in the Indian population.Seven SNPs in the TNFSF15 gene (rs10114470, rs3810936, rs6478108, rs4263839, rs6478109, rs7848647 and rs7869487) were genotyped in 309 CD patients, 330 UC patients and 437 healthy controls using the Sequenom iPLEX MassArray platform. Disease associations were evaluated for allelotypes and for genotypes.The minor T alleles and the TT genotypes of rs10114470 and rs3810936 were significantly protectively associated with both CD and UC. The CC genotype of rs6478108, AA genotype of rs4263839, the AA genotype of rs6478109, the TT genotype of rs7848647 and the CC genotype of rs7869487 were all protectively associated with CD but not with UC. Two haplotype blocks could be discerned, one where SNPs rs10114470 and rs3810936 were in tight LD (D' = 0.8) and the other where rs6478108, rs4263839, rs6478109, rs7848647 and rs7869487 were in tight LD (D' 0.92-1.00). The second block of haplotypes were not associated with CD or with UC. The first block of haplotypes was very significantly associated with both CD and UC.Strong associations exist between TNFSF15 gene polymorphisms and IBD (both CD and UC) in the Indian population."
https://openalex.org/W2066297934,"Dammarane steroids (DS) are a class of chemical compounds present in Panax ginseng. Here, we evaluated the effect of 10 weeks of DS supplementation on inflammatory modulation in the soleus muscle following eccentric exercise (EE)-induced muscle damage (downhill running). Eighty rats were randomized into 4 groups of DS supplementation (saline, 20, 60, 120 mg/kg body weight). Inflammatory markers were measured at rest and again 1 h after EE. At rest, NFκB signaling, TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNAs, 3-nitrotyrosine, glutathione peroxidase, and GCS (glutamylcysteine synthetase) levels were significantly elevated in the skeletal muscle of DS-treated rats in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, there were no detectable increases in the number of necrotic muscle fibers or CD68+ M1 macrophages. However, muscle strength, centronucleation, IL-10 mRNA expression, and the number of CD163+ M2 macrophages increased significantly over controls with DS treatment in rat soleus muscle. Under EE-challenged conditions, significant increases in muscle fiber necrosis, CD68+ M1 macrophage distribution, and 3-nitrotyrosine were absent in rats that received low and medium doses (20 and 60 mg/kg) of DS treatment, suggesting that DS possess anti-inflammatory action protecting against a muscle-damaging challenge. However, this protective activity was diminished when a high dose of DS (120 mg/kg) was administered, suggesting that DS possess hormetic properties. In conclusion, our study provides new evidence suggesting that DS is an ergogenic component of ginseng that potentiate inflammation at baseline but that produce anti-inflammatory effects on skeletal muscle following muscle-damaging exercise. Furthermore, high doses should be avoided in formulating ginseng-based products."
https://openalex.org/W2055310509,"Mutations in the WNT/beta-catenin pathway are present in the majority of all sporadic colorectal cancers (CRCs), and histone deacetylase inhibitors induce apoptosis in CRC cells with such mutations. This apoptosis is counteracted by (1) the signaling heterogeneity of CRC cell populations, and (2) the survival pathways induced by mitogens secreted from apoptotic cells. The phenomena of signaling heterogeneity and apoptosis-induced survival constitute the immediate mechanisms of resistance to histone deacetylase inhibitors, and probably other chemotherapeutic agents. We explored the strategy of augmenting CRC cell death by inhibiting all survival pathways induced by the pro-apoptotic agent LBH589, a histone deacetylase inhibitor: AKT, JAK/STAT, and ERK signaling. The apoptosis-enhancing ability of a cocktail of synthetic inhibitors of proliferation was compared to the effects of the natural product propolis. We utilized colorectal adenoma, drug-sensitive and drug-resistant colorectal carcinoma cells to evaluate the apoptotic potential of the combination treatments. The results suggest that an effective approach to CRC combination therapy is to combine apoptosis-inducing drugs (e.g., histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as LBH589) with agents that suppress all compensatory survival pathways induced during apoptosis (such as the cocktail of inhibitors of apoptosis-associated proliferation). The same paradigm can be applied to a CRC prevention approach, as the apoptotic effect of butyrate, a diet-derived histone deacetylase inhibitor, is augmented by other dietary agents that modulate survival pathways (e.g., propolis and coffee extract). Thus, dietary supplements composed by fermentable fiber, propolis, and coffee extract may effectively counteract neoplastic growth in the colon."
https://openalex.org/W2168502452,"Cystic fibrosis is associated with increased inflammatory responses to pathogen challenge. Here we revisited the role of IL-1β in lung pathology using the experimental F508del-CFTR murine model on C57BL/6 genetic background (Cftr(tm1eur) or d/d), on double deficient for d/d and type 1 interleukin-1 receptor (d/d X IL-1R1-/-), and antibody neutralization. At steady state, young adult d/d mice did not show any signs of spontaneous lung inflammation. However, IL-1R1 deficiency conferred partial protection to repeated P. aeruginosa endotoxins/LPS lung instillation in d/d mice, as 50% of d/d mice succumbed to inflammation, whereas all d/d x IL-1R1-/- double mutants survived with lower initial weight loss and less pulmonary collagen and mucus production, suggesting that the absence of IL-1R1 signaling is protective in d/d mice in LPS-induced lung damage. Using P. aeruginosa acute lung infection we found heightened neutrophil recruitment in d/d mice with higher epithelial damage, increased bacterial load in BALF, and augmented IL-1β and TNF-α in parenchyma as compared to WT mice. Thus, F508del-CFTR mice show enhanced IL-1β signaling in response to P. aeruginosa. IL-1β antibody neutralization had no effect on lung homeostasis in either d/d or WT mice, however P. aeruginosa induced lung inflammation and bacterial load were diminished by IL-1β antibody neutralization. In conclusion, enhanced susceptibility to P. aeruginosa in d/d mice correlates with an excessive inflammation and with increased IL-1β production and reduced bacterial clearance. Further, we show that neutralization of IL-1β in d/d mice through the double mutation d/d x IL-1R1-/- and in WT via antibody neutralization attenuates inflammation. This supports the notion that intervention in the IL-1R1/IL-1β pathway may be detrimental in CF patients."
https://openalex.org/W2063550887,"Objective We examine the trend in causes of death among people living with AIDS in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, in the periods before and after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and we investigate potential disparities across districts of residence. Methods Descriptive study of three periods: pre-HAART (1991–1996); early post-HAART (1997–1999); and late post-HAART (2000–2006). The data source was the São Paulo State STD/AIDS Program and São Paulo State Data Analysis Foundation. Causes of death were classified by the ICD-9 (1991–1995) and ICD-10 (1996–2006). We estimated age-adjusted mortality rates for leading underlying causes of death and described underlying and associated causes of death according to sociodemographic characteristics and area of residence. We used Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test to compare categorical variables. Areas of residence were categorized using a socioeconomic index. To analyze trends we apply generalized linear model with Poisson regression. Results We evaluated 32,808 AIDS-related deaths. Between the pre- and late post-HAART periods, the proportion of deaths whose underlying causes were non-AIDS-related diseases increased from 0.2% to 9.6% (p<0.001): from 0.01% to 1.67% (p<0.001) for cardiovascular diseases; 0.01% to 1.62% (p<0.001) for bacterial/unspecified pneumonia; and 0.03% to 1.46% (p<0.001) for non-AIDS-defining cancers. In the late post-HAART period, the most common associated causes of death were bacterial/unspecified pneumonia (35.94%), septicemia (33.46%), cardiovascular diseases (10.11%) and liver diseases (8.0%); and common underlying causes, besides AIDS disease, included non-AIDS-defining cancers in high-income areas, cardiovascular diseases in middle-income areas and assault in low-income areas. Conclusions The introduction of HAART has shifted the mortality profile away from AIDS-related conditions, suggesting changes in the pattern of morbidity, but heterogeneously according to area of residence. There is a need for public policies aimed at adapting health care services to address the new scenario."
https://openalex.org/W2009719472,"The ways in which embryo development can vary across individuals of a population determine how genetic variation translates into adult phenotypic variation. The study of developmental variation has been hampered by the lack of quantitative methods for the joint analysis of embryo shape and the spatial distribution of cellular activity within the developing embryo geometry. By drawing from the strength of geometric morphometrics and pixel/voxel-based image analysis, we present a new approach for the biometric analysis of two-dimensional and three-dimensional embryonic images. Well-differentiated structures are described in terms of their shape, whereas structures with diffuse boundaries, such as emerging cell condensations or molecular gradients, are described as spatial patterns of intensities. We applied this approach to microscopic images of the tail fins of larval and juvenile rainbow trout. Inter-individual variation of shape and cell density was found highly spatially structured across the tail fin and temporally dynamic throughout the investigated period."
https://openalex.org/W2050216628,"Posterior Capsular Opacification (PCO) is the capsule fibrosis developed on implanted IntraOcular Lens (IOL) by the de-differentiation of Lens Epithelial Cells (LECs) undergoing Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). Literature has shown that the incidence of PCO is multifactorial including the patient's age or disease, surgical technique, and IOL design and material. Reports comparing hydrophilic and hydrophobic acrylic IOLs have shown that the former has more severe PCO. On the other hand, we have previously demonstrated that the adhesion of LECs is favored on hydrophobic compared to hydrophilic materials. By combining these two facts and contemporary knowledge in PCO development via the EMT pathway, we propose a biomimetically inspired strategy to promote LEC adhesion without de-differentiation to reduce the risk of PCO development. By surface grafting of a cell adhesion molecule (RGD peptide) onto the conventional hydrophilic acrylic IOL material, the surface-functionalized IOL can be used to reconstitute a capsule-LEC-IOL sandwich structure, which has been considered to prevent PCO formation in literature. Our results show that the innovative biomaterial improves LEC adhesion, while also exhibiting similar optical (light transmittance, optical bench) and mechanical (haptic compression force, IOL injection force) properties compared to the starting material. In addition, compared to the hydrophobic IOL material, our bioactive biomaterial exhibits similar abilities in LEC adhesion, morphology maintenance, and EMT biomarker expression, which is the crucial pathway to induce PCO. The in vitro assays suggest that this biomaterial has the potential to reduce the risk factor of PCO development."
https://openalex.org/W2028361026,"Somatic mutations or loss of von Hippel–Lindau (pVHL) happen in the majority of VHL disease tumors, which present a constitutively active Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF), essential for tumor growth. Recently described mechanisms for pVHL modulation shed light on the open question of the HIF/pVHL pathway regulation. The aim of the present study was to determine the molecular mechanism by which RSUME stabilizes HIFs, by studying RSUME effect on pVHL function and to determine the role of RSUME on pVHL-related tumor progression. We determined that RSUME sumoylates and physically interacts with pVHL and negatively regulates the assembly of the complex between pVHL, Elongins and Cullins (ECV), inhibiting HIF-1 and 2α ubiquitination and degradation. We found that RSUME is expressed in human VHL tumors (renal clear-cell carcinoma (RCC), pheochromocytoma and hemangioblastoma) and by overexpressing or silencing RSUME in a pVHL-HIF-oxygen-dependent degradation stability reporter assay, we determined that RSUME is necessary for the loss of function of type 2 pVHL mutants. The functional RSUME/pVHL interaction in VHL-related tumor progression was further confirmed using a xenograft assay in nude mice. RCC clones, in which RSUME was knocked down and express either pVHL wt or type 2 mutation, have an impaired tumor growth, as well as HIF-2α, vascular endothelial growth factor A and tumor vascularization diminution. This work shows a novel mechanism for VHL tumor progression and presents a new mechanism and factor for targeting tumor-related pathologies with pVHL/HIF altered function."
https://openalex.org/W2088023657,"Background/Aims The associations between phosphate, calcium, and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and composite cardiovascular end points have been studied. This study examined the associations of these markers with myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke separately. Methods This is a longitudinal study on 65,849 hemodialysis patients from the Japan Renal Data Registry. Patients with prior events at baseline were excluded. Predictors were phosphate, albumin-corrected calcium, intact PTH, and calcium times phosphate product levels. Outcome was the first episode of MI or stroke during a 1-year observation period. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analyses, adjusted for potential confounders. Results There were 1,048, 651, and 2,089 events of incident MI, hemorrhagic, and ischemic stroke, respectively. Incident MI was associated with phosphate levels ≥6.5 mg/dL (odds ratio 1.49; confidence interval 1.23–1.80) compared with phosphate levels of 4.7–5.4 mg/dL and intact PTH levels>500 pg/mL (1.35; 1.03–1.79) compared with intact PTH levels of 151–300 pg/mL. Higher albumin-corrected calcium level was positively associated with MI (p = 0.04 by trend analysis). Hemorrhagic stroke was associated only with intact PTH levels>500 pg/mL (1.54; 1.10–2.17). Incident ischemic stroke had no association with phosphate, calcium, or intact PTH levels. The association of calcium times phosphate product with outcomes was essentially the same pattern as that of phosphate and outcomes. Conclusions MI was associated with phosphate, calcium, and intact PTH levels, whereas hemorrhagic stroke was associated only with intact PTH. Ischemic stroke was not associated with any of them. The potential distinct beneficial effect on MI and stroke by managing bone and mineral disease should be investigated in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2024509015,"Background Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) have shown immunosuppressive activity in transplantation. This study was designed to determine whether BMMSCs could improve outcomes of small bowel transplantation in rats. Methods Heterotopic small bowel transplantation was performed from Brown Norway to Lewis rats, followed by infusion of BMMSCs through the superficial dorsal veins of the penis. Controls included rats infused with normal saline (allogeneic control), isogeneically transplanted rats (BN-BN) and nontransplanted animals. The animals were sacrificed after 1, 5, 7 or 10 days. Small bowel histology and apoptosis, cytokine concentrations in serum and intestinal grafts, and numbers of T regulatory (Treg) cells were assessed at each time point. Results Acute cellular rejection occurred soon after transplantation and became aggravated over time in the allogeneic control rats, with increase in apoptosis, inflammatory response, and T helper (Th)1/Th2 and Th17/Treg-related cytokines. BMMSCs significantly attenuated acute cellular rejection, reduced apoptosis and suppressed the concentrations of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-17, IL-23, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interferon (IFN)-γ while upregulating IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β expression and increasing Treg levels. Conclusion BMMSCs improve the outcomes of allogeneic small bowel transplantation by attenuating the inflammatory response and acute cellular rejection. Treatment with BMMSCs may overcome acute cellular rejection in small bowel transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W1987364832,"Aims Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a rare condition of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), in which post-capillary veins are affected. Since the therapeutic approach in PVOD differs from other forms of PAH, it is crucial to establish the diagnosis. Due to the fact that affected patients are often hemodynamically unstable, minimal invasive procedures are necessary for the diagnostic work-up. Chronic alveolar haemorrhage has been observed during bronchoalveolar lavage in PVOD cases. This study therefore investigates whether signs of alveolar haemorrhage can also be found in the sputum of these patients. Methods and Results Six patients suffering from PVOD were included in this analysis. As controls, patients with idiopathic PAH (n = 11), chronic thromboembolic PH (n = 9) and with sclerodermia-associated PH (n = 10) were assessed. Sputum from every patient was obtained by a non-invasive manner. The amount of haemosiderin-laden macrophages was determined using the Golde score. There were statistically significant more haemosiderin-laden macrophages in the sputum of patients suffering from PVOD as compared to the other groups (P<0.05). Assuming a cut-off of 200 on the Golde score, all of the 6 PVOD patients surpassed this value compared with only 1 out of the 30 cases with precapillary PH. Thus, sensitivity and specificity with respect to the diagnosis of PVOD was 100% and 97%, respectively. Conclusion The content of haemosiderin-laden macrophages in the sputum of patients suffering from PVOD is significantly higher as compared to other forms of PH and may be useful in the non-invasive diagnostic work-up of these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2016089804,"Aphids exhibit a form of phenotypic plasticity, called polyphenism, in which genetically identical females reproduce sexually during one part of the life cycle and asexually (via parthenogenesis) during the remainder of the life cycle. The molecular basis for aphid parthenogenesis is unknown. Cytological observations of aphid parthenogenesis suggest that asexual oogenesis evolved either through a modification of meiosis or from a mitotic process. As a test of these alternatives, we assessed the expression levels and expression patterns of canonical meiotic recombination and germline genes in the sexual and asexual ovaries of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. We observed expression of all meiosis genes in similar patterns in asexual and sexual ovaries, with the exception that some genes encoding Argonaute-family members were not expressed in sexual ovaries. In addition, we observed that asexual aphid tissues accumulated unspliced transcripts of Spo11, whereas sexual aphid tissues accumulated primarily spliced transcripts. In situ hybridization revealed Spo11 transcript in sexual germ cells and undetectable levels of Spo11 transcript in asexual germ cells. We also found that an obligately asexual strain of pea aphid produced little spliced Spo11 transcript. Together, these results suggest that parthenogenetic oogenesis evolved from a meiosis-like, and not a mitosis-like, process and that the aphid reproductive polyphenism may involve a modification of Spo11 gene activity."
https://openalex.org/W2027707331,"Background Serum γ - glutamyltransferase (GGT) is implicated in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Albuminuria is a marker of endothelial damage and correlated with structural and functional integrity of the vasculature. Our objective was to evaluate the association between serum GGT level and prevalence of albuminuria in a Chinese population. Materials and Methods We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study in 9,702 subjects aged 40 years or older. Increased urinary albumin excretion was defined according to the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) ranges greater or equal than 30 mg/g. Low-grade albuminuria was defined according to the highest quartile of ACR in participants without increased urinary albumin excretion. Results The prevalence of low-grade albuminuria and increased urinary albumin excretion were respectively 23.4% and 6.6% in this population and gradually increased across the sex-specific serum GGT quartiles (all P for trend <0.05). In logistic regression analysis, compared with subjects in the lowest quartile of serum GGT level, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) in the highest quartile was 1.22 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04–1.43] for low-grade albuminuria and 1.55 (95% CI, 1.18–2.04) for increased urinary albumin excretion. In subgroup analysis, significant relationship of serum GGT level with both low-grade albuminuria and increased urinary albumin excretion were detected in women, younger subjects, overweight subjects and in those with hypertension or glomerular filtration rate greater than 90 (all P <0.05). Conclusion Serum GGT level is associated with urinary albumin excretion in middle-aged and elderly Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W2074382877,"Mechanical forces play an important role in proper embryologic development, and similarly such forces can directly impact pluripotency and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) in vitro. In addition, manipulation of the embryoid body (EB) microenvironment, such as by incorporation of microspheres or microparticles, can similarly influence fate determination. In this study, we developed a mechanical stimulation regimen using permanent neodymium magnets to magnetically attract cells within an EB. Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic Acid (RGD)-conjugated paramagnetic beads were incorporated into the interior of the EBs during aggregation, allowing us to exert force on individual cells using short-term magnetization. EBs were stimulated for one hour at different magnetic field strengths, subsequently exerting a range of force intensity on the cells at different stages of early EB development. Our results demonstrated that following exposure to a 0.2 Tesla magnetic field, ESCs respond to magnetically mediated strain by activating Protein Kinase A (PKA) and increasing phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2) expression. The timing of stimulation can also be tailored to guide ESC differentiation: the combination of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) supplementation with one hour of magnetic attraction on Day 3 enhances cardiomyogenesis by increasing contractile activity and the percentage of sarcomeric α-actin-expressing cells compared to control samples with BMP4 alone. Interestingly, we also observed that the beads alone had some impact on differentiation by increasingly slightly, albeit not significantly, the percentage of cardiomyocytes. Together these results suggest that magnetically mediated strain can be used to enhance the percentage of mouse ESC-derived cardiomyocytes over current differentiation protocols."
https://openalex.org/W1970252287,"Graph analysis is a promising tool to quantify brain connectivity. However, an essential requirement is that the graph measures are reproducible and robust. We have studied the reproducibility and robustness of various graph measures in group based and in individual binary and weighted networks derived from a task fMRI experiment during explicit associative-semantic processing of words and pictures. The nodes of the network were defined using an independent study and the connectivity was based on the partial correlation of the time series between any pair of nodes. The results showed that in case of binary networks, global graph measures exhibit a good reproducibility and robustness for networks which are not too sparse and these figures of merit depend on the graph measure and on the density of the network. Furthermore, group based binary networks should be derived from groups of sufficient size and the lower the density the more subjects are required to obtain robust values. Local graph measures are very variable in terms of reproducibility and should be interpreted with care. For weighted networks, we found good reproducibility (average test-retest variability <5% and ICC values >0.4) when using subject specific networks and this will allow us to relate network properties to individual subject information."
https://openalex.org/W1981651387,"As corals decline and macroalgae proliferate on coral reefs, coral-macroalgal competition becomes more frequent and ecologically important. Whether corals are damaged by these interactions depends on susceptibility of the coral and traits of macroalgal competitors. Investigating changes in gene expression of corals and their intracellular symbiotic algae, Symbiodinium, in response to contact with different macroalgae provides insight into the biological processes and cellular pathways affected by competition with macroalgae. We evaluated the gene expression profiles of coral and Symbiodinium genes from two confamilial corals, Acropora millepora and Montipora digitata, after 6 h and 48 h of contact with four common macroalgae that differ in their allelopathic potency to corals. Contacts with macroalgae affected different biological pathways in the more susceptible (A. millepora) versus the more resistant (M. digitata) coral. Genes of coral hosts and of their associated Symbiodinium also responded in species-specific and time-specific ways to each macroalga. Changes in number and expression intensity of affected genes were greater after 6 h compared to 48 h of contact and were greater following contact with Chlorodesmis fastigiata and Amphiroa crassa than following contact with Galaxaura filamentosa or Turbinaria conoides. We documented a divergence in transcriptional responses between two confamilial corals and their associated Symbiodinium, as well as a diversity of dynamic responses within each coral species with respect to the species of macroalgal competitor and the duration of exposure to that competitor. These responses included early initiation of immune processes by Montipora, which is more resistant to damage after long-term macroalgal contact. Activation of the immune response by corals that better resist algal competition is consistent with the hypothesis that some macroalgal effects on corals may be mediated by microbial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2004095032,"Development of thymocytes through the positive selection checkpoint requires the rearrangement and expression of a suitable T cell receptor (TCR) α-chain that can pair with the already-expressed β-chain to make a TCR that is selectable. That is, it must have sufficient affinity for self MHC-peptide to induce the signals required for differentiation, but not too strong so as to induce cell death. Because both alleles of the α-chain continue to rearrange until a positively-selectable heterodimer is formed, thymocytes and T cells can in principle express dual α-chains. However, cell-surface expression of two TCRs is comparatively rare in mature T cells because of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms termed “phenotypic allelic exclusion”. We produced mice transgenic for a rearranged β-chain and for two unrearranged α-chains on a genetic background where endogenous α-chains could not be rearranged. Both Vα3.2 and Vα2 containing α-chains were efficiently positively selected, to the extent that a population of dual α-chain-bearing cells was not distinguishable from single α-chain-expressors. Surprisingly, Vα3.2-expressing cells were much more frequent than the Vα2 transgene-expressing cells, even though this Vα3.2-Vβ5 combination can reconstitute a known selectable TCR. In accord with previous work on the Vα3 repertoire, T cells bearing Vα3.2 expressed from the rearranged minilocus were predominantly selected into the CD8+ T cell subpopulation. Because of the dominance of Vα3.2 expression over Vα2 expressed from the miniloci, the peripheral T cell population was predominantly CD8+ cells."
https://openalex.org/W2076176957,"Viral gastroenteritis is the most common causal agent of public health problems worldwide. Noroviruses cause nonbacterial acute gastroenteritis in humans of all ages. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of norovirus infection in children with acute gastroenteritis admitted to university hospitals in South Korea. We also analyzed the genetic diversity of the viruses and identified novel recombination events among the identified viral strains. Of 502 children with acute gastroenteritis admitted to our three hospitals between January 2011 and March 2012, genotyping of human noroviruses was performed in 171 (34%) norovirus-positive samples. Of these samples, 170 (99.5%) were in genogroup II (GII), while only one (0.5%) was in genogroup I (GI). The most common GII strain was the GII.4-2006b variant (n = 96, 56.5%), followed by GII.6 (n = 23, 13.5%), GII.12 (n = 22, 12.9%), GII.3 (n = 20, 11.8%), GII.2 (n = 6, 3.5%), GII.b (n = 2, 1.2%), and GII.10 (n = 1, 0.6%). Potential recombination events (polymerase/capsid) were detected in 39 GII strains (22.9%), and the most frequent genotypes were GII.4/GII.12 (n = 12, 30.8%), GII.4/GII.6 (n = 12, 30.8%), GII.4/GII.3 (n = 8, 20.5%), GII.b/GII.3 (n = 3, 7.7%), GII.16/GII.2 (n = 2, 5.1%), GII.4/GII.2 (n = 1, 2.6%), and GII.2/GII.10 (n = 1, 2.6%). For the first time, a novel GII.2/GII.10 recombination was detected; we also identified the GII.16/GII.2 strain for the first time in South Korea. Our data provided important insights into new recombination events, which may prove valuable for predicting the emergence of circulating norovirus strains with global epidemic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2031434959,"The Korean Native Chicken (KNC) is an important endemic biological resource in Korea. While numerous studies have been conducted exploring this breed, none have used next-generation sequencing to identify its specific genomic features. We sequenced five strains of KNC and identified 10.9 million SNVs and 1.3 million InDels. Through the analysis, we found that the highly variable region common to all 5 strains had genes like PCHD15, CISD1, PIK3C2A, and NUCB2 that might be related to the phenotypic traits of the chicken such as auditory sense, growth rate and egg traits. In addition, we assembled unaligned reads that could not be mapped to the reference genome. By assembling the unaligned reads, we were able to present genomic sequences characteristic to the KNC. Based on this, we also identified genes related to the olfactory receptors and antigen that are common to all 5 strains. Finally, through the reconstructed mitochondrial genome sequences, we performed phylogenomic analysis and elucidated the maternal origin of the artificially restored KNC. Our results revealed that the KNC has multiple maternal origins which are in agreement with Korea's history of chicken breed imports. The results presented here provide a valuable basis for future research on genomic features of KNC and further understanding of KNC's origin."

Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper, we revised the diagnosis of Necrotauliidae Handlirsch, 1906. One new genus and species of Necrotauliidae is described. An analysis based on the fossil morphological characters clarified the taxonomic status of the new taxa. Conclusions/Significance New fossil evidence supports the viewpoint that the family Necrotauliidae belongs to the Integripalpia."
https://openalex.org/W2033180559,"This study was performed to assess the prognostic relevance of genomic aberrations at chromosome 4q in NSCLC patients. We have previously identified copy number changes at 4q12-q32 to be significantly associated with the early hematogenous dissemination of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and now aim to narrow down potential hot-spots within this 107 Mb spanning region. Using eight microsatellite markers at position 4q12-35, allelic imbalance (AI) analyses were performed on a preliminary study cohort (n = 86). Positions indicating clinicopathological and prognostic associations in AI analyses were further validated in a larger study cohort using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 209 NSCLC patients. Losses at positions 4q21.23 and 4q22.1 were shown to be associated with advanced clinicopathological characteristics as well as with shortened disease free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) (DFS: P = 0.019; OS: P = 0.002). Multivariate analyses identified the losses of 4q21.23-22.1 to be an independent prognostic marker for both DFS and OS in NSCLC (HR 1.64–2.20, all P<0.04), and especially in squamous cell lung cancer (P<0.05). A case report study of a lung cancer patient further revealed a loss of 4q21.23 in disseminated tumor cells (DTCs). Neither gains at the latter positions, nor genomic aberrations at 4q12, 4q31.2 and 4q35.1, indicated a prognostic relevance. In conclusion, our data indicate that loss at 4q21.23-22.1 in NSCLC is of prognostic relevance in NSCLC patients and thus, includes potential new tumor suppressor genes with clinical relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2084222161,"Assemblies of vertically connected neurons in the cerebral cortex form information processing units (columns) that participate in the distribution and segregation of sensory signals. Despite well-accepted models of columnar architecture, functional mechanisms of inter-laminar communication remain poorly understood. Hence, the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the effects of sensory information features on columnar response properties. Using acute recording techniques, extracellular response activity was collected from the right hemisphere of eight mature cats (felis catus). Recordings were conducted with multichannel electrodes that permitted the simultaneous acquisition of neuronal activity within primary auditory cortex columns. Neuronal responses to simple (pure tones), complex (noise burst and frequency modulated sweeps), and ecologically relevant (con-specific vocalizations) acoustic signals were measured. Collectively, the present investigation demonstrates that despite consistencies in neuronal tuning (characteristic frequency), irregularities in discharge activity between neurons of individual A1 columns increase as a function of spectral (signal complexity) and temporal (duration) acoustic variations."
