https://openalex.org/W2162056974,"Innocuous touch of the skin is detected by distinct populations of neurons, the low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs), which are classified as Aβ-, Aδ-, and C-LTMRs. Here, we report genetic labeling of LTMR subtypes and visualization of their relative patterns of axonal endings in hairy skin and the spinal cord. We found that each of the three major hair follicle types of trunk hairy skin (guard, awl/auchene, and zigzag hairs) is innervated by a unique and invariant combination of LTMRs; thus, each hair follicle type is a functionally distinct mechanosensory end organ. Moreover, the central projections of Aβ-, Aδ-, and C-LTMRs that innervate the same or adjacent hair follicles form narrow LTMR columns in the dorsal horn. These findings support a model of mechanosensation in which the activities of Aβ-, Aδ-, and C-LTMRs are integrated within dorsal horn LTMR columns and processed into outputs that underlie the perception of myriad touch sensations."
https://openalex.org/W2170696599,"We describe tethered conformation capture (TCC), a method for genome-wide mapping of chromatin interactions. By performing ligations on solid substrates rather than in solution, TCC substantially enhances the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby facilitating a detailed analysis of interactions within and between chromosomes. We identified a group of regions in each chromosome in human cells that account for the majority of interchromosomal interactions. These regions are marked by high transcriptional activity, suggesting that their interactions are mediated by transcriptional machinery. Each of these regions interacts with numerous other such regions throughout the genome in an indiscriminate fashion, partly driven by the accessibility of the partners. As a different combination of interactions is likely present in different cells, we developed a computational method to translate the TCC data into physical chromatin contacts in a population of three-dimensional genome structures. Statistical analysis of the resulting population demonstrates that the indiscriminate properties of interchromosomal interactions are consistent with the well-known architectural features of the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W2018338123,"Rosa Rademakers and colleagues show that mutations in CSF1R cause hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids, a central nervous system white-matter disease with variable clinical presentations that include personality and behavioral changes, dementia, depression, parkinsonism and seizures. Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS) is an autosomal-dominant central nervous system white-matter disease with variable clinical presentations, including personality and behavioral changes, dementia, depression, parkinsonism, seizures and other phenotypes1,2. We combined genome-wide linkage analysis with exome sequencing and identified 14 different mutations affecting the tyrosine kinase domain of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (encoded by CSF1R) in 14 families with HDLS. In one kindred, we confirmed the de novo occurrence of the mutation. Follow-up sequencing identified an additional CSF1R mutation in an individual diagnosed with corticobasal syndrome. In vitro, CSF-1 stimulation resulted in rapid autophosphorylation of selected tyrosine residues in the kinase domain of wild-type but not mutant CSF1R, suggesting that HDLS may result from partial loss of CSF1R function. As CSF1R is a crucial mediator of microglial proliferation and differentiation in the brain, our findings suggest an important role for microglial dysfunction in HDLS pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2127835459,"Hundreds of chromatin regulators (CRs) control chromatin structure and function by catalyzing and binding histone modifications, yet the rules governing these key processes remain obscure. Here, we present a systematic approach to infer CR function. We developed ChIP-string, a meso-scale assay that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation with a signature readout of 487 representative loci. We applied ChIP-string to screen 145 antibodies, thereby identifying effective reagents, which we used to map the genome-wide binding of 29 CRs in two cell types. We found that specific combinations of CRs colocalize in characteristic patterns at distinct chromatin environments, at genes of coherent functions, and at distal regulatory elements. When comparing between cell types, CRs redistribute to different loci but maintain their modular and combinatorial associations. Our work provides a multiplex method that substantially enhances the ability to monitor CR binding, presents a large resource of CR maps, and reveals common principles for combinatorial CR function."

https://openalex.org/W2061643993,"An unusual feature of the cerebellar cortex is that its output neurons, Purkinje cells, release GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid). Their high intrinsic firing rates (50 Hz) and extensive convergence predict that their target neurons in the cerebellar nuclei would be largely inhibited unless Purkinje cells pause their spiking, yet Purkinje and nuclear neuron firing rates do not always vary inversely. One indication of how these synapses transmit information is that populations of Purkinje neurons synchronize their spikes during cerebellar behaviours. If nuclear neurons respond to Purkinje synchrony, they may encode signals from subsets of inhibitory inputs. Here we show in weanling and adult mice that nuclear neurons transmit the timing of synchronous Purkinje afferent spikes, owing to modest Purkinje-to-nuclear convergence ratios (∼40:1), fast inhibitory postsynaptic current kinetics (τ(decay) = 2.5 ms) and high intrinsic firing rates (∼90 Hz). In vitro, dynamically clamped asynchronous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials mimicking Purkinje afferents suppress nuclear cell spiking, whereas synchronous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials entrain nuclear cell spiking. With partial synchrony, nuclear neurons time-lock their spikes to the synchronous subpopulation of inputs, even when only 2 out of 40 afferents synchronize. In vivo, nuclear neurons reliably phase-lock to regular trains of molecular layer stimulation. Thus, cerebellar nuclear neurons can preferentially relay the spike timing of synchronized Purkinje cells to downstream premotor areas."
https://openalex.org/W2163058756,"The authors show that structural connectivity, as measured by diffusion-weighted imaging, can predict functional activation to faces in the fusiform gyrus. The structure–function correspondence developed in one group of subjects outperformed two other predictive models and was able to predict activation in a second group of subjects. A fundamental assumption in neuroscience is that brain structure determines function. Accordingly, functionally distinct regions of cortex should be structurally distinct in their connections to other areas. We tested this hypothesis in relation to face selectivity in the fusiform gyrus. By using only structural connectivity, as measured through diffusion-weighted imaging, we were able to predict functional activation to faces in the fusiform gyrus. These predictions outperformed two control models and a standard group-average benchmark. The structure–function relationship discovered from the initial participants was highly robust in predicting activation in a second group of participants, despite differences in acquisition parameters and stimuli. This approach can thus reliably estimate activation in participants who cannot perform functional imaging tasks and is an alternative to group-activation maps. Additionally, we identified cortical regions whose connectivity was highly influential in predicting face selectivity within the fusiform, suggesting a possible mechanistic architecture underlying face processing in humans."

Neurexins are a highly polymorphic family of synaptic receptors diversified by extensive alternative splicing. Neurexin variants exhibit distinct isoform-specific biochemical interactions and synapse assembly functions, but the mechanisms governing splice isoform choice are not understood. We demonstrate that Nrxn1 alternative splicing is temporally and spatially controlled in the mouse brain.

More recently, activity-dependent alternative splicing has emerged as an additional mechanism for the dynamic modification of neuronal function where production of specific splice variants modifies cellular trafficking, signaling properties or function of synaptic proteins (An and Grabowski, 2007An P. Grabowski P.J. Exon silencing by UAGG motifs in response to neuronal excitation.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e36Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2007bLi Q. Lee J.A. Black D.L. Neuronal regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Signaling pathways for activity-dependent splicing regulation are only beginning to be uncovered. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV) activation modifies alternative splicing in cultured neuronal cells. Some pre-mRNAs contain CaMKIV-responsive elements (CaRRE1 and 2) and UAGG motifs that impose depolarization-dependent regulation (Xie and Black, 2001Xie J. Black D.L.

Lee C.J. Black D.L. Depolarization and CaM kinase IV modulate NMDA receptor splicing through two essential RNA elements.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e40Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, these RNA elements are not found in all pre-mRNAs subject to depolarization-dependent alternative splicing, and additional response elements remain to be uncovered. One class of synaptic cell surface receptors that is extensively regulated at the level of alternative splicing is the Neurexins (Ushkaryov et al., 1992Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M.

Neurexins contribute to the assembly of functional presynaptic terminals (Dean et al., 2003Dean C. Scholl F.G. Choih J. DeMaria S. Berger J. Isacoff E. Scheiffele P.

Three neurexin genes (Nrxn1, 2, 3) each encode two primary neurexin transcripts (alpha and beta) that are subject to alternative splicing at five positions yielding more than 3,000 protein-coding mRNAs (Rowen et al., 2002Rowen L.

This molecular diversity as well as the capability of neurexins to organize synaptic structures led to the hypothesis that alternative splicing may give rise to cell-type- and/or synapse-specific functions (Chih et al., 2006Chih B.

Most attention of functional studies has focused on the Nrxn alternatively spliced segment 4 (AS4), which is highly conserved in all Nrxn pre-mRNAs. Incorporation of exon 20 at AS4 generates NRX 4(+) protein variants containing a 30 amino acid insertion, whereas skipping results in the 4(−) variant. Importantly, alternative splicing of Nrxns may underlie an adhesive code: The NRX 4(+) and 4(−) variants exhibit differential interactions with several ligands that are critical mediators of synaptogenesis, including neuroligins, leucine-rich repeat proteins (LRRTMs), and the Cbln1-GluD2 complex (Ichtchenko et al., 1995Ichtchenko K.

For example, the NRX1 4(+) isoform exhibits only weak adhesion and binding with the neuroligin-1B postsynaptic receptor (NL1B), whereas the NRX1 4(−) isoform engages in strong adhesive interactions (Dean et al., 2003Dean C.

The critical functional consequences of Nrxn alternative splicing at AS4 raise the question of how alternative splice isoform choice is regulated. Genome-wide identification of mRNA targets for several RNA-binding proteins has not yielded insights into Nrxn1 AS4 regulation (Ule et al., 2005Ule J. Ule A. Spencer J. Williams A. Hu J.S. Cline M.

Dynamic changes in neurexins' alternative splicing: role of Rho-associated protein kinases and relevance to memory formation.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e18579Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the RNA response elements and RNA-binding proteins conferring alternative splice isoform choice in Nrxns have not been identified. In fact, the RNA-binding proteins controlling activity-dependent alternative splicing of any neuronal pre-mRNA are not understood. Here, we describe a signaling pathway and RNA response elements for Nrxn1 and demonstrate that the KH-domain RNA-binding protein SAM68 (Src-associated in mitosis 68 kDa protein) is a key regulator of activity-dependent alternative splicing in the central nervous system. Incorporation of the cassette exon at AS4 (exon 20) in Nrxn1, 2, 3 varies across brain regions (Figure 1A ; Figure S1 available online). Moreover, for some regions exon 20 inclusion differs between the three Nrxns indicating gene-specific regulation. In the developing cerebellar cortex Nrxn 4(−) mRNAs declines successively from postnatal day 0 to postnatal day 21 (Figure 1B). This reveals spatial and developmental regulation of Nrxn alternative splicing in the mouse brain.Figure S1Brain Area Survey for Nrxn1,2,3 AS4 Alternative Splice Isoforms, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Distribution of Nrxn1,2,3 variants in adult brain regions was assayed by semiquantitative RT-PCR performed under PCR conditions with amplification in the linear range.

The changes in Nrxn splicing regulation during the first 2 postnatal weeks parallel the developmental shift in resting membrane potential of cerebellar granule cells (−25 to −55 mV) (Rossi et al., 1998Rossi P. De Filippi G. Armano S. Taglietti V. D'Angelo E. The weaver mutation causes a loss of inward rectifier current regulation in premigratory granule cells of the mouse cerebellum.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3537-3547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether alternative splicing is altered by membrane depolarization we stimulated cultured granule cells by addition of 25 mM potassium chloride (KCl), which shifts the membrane potential to approximately −36 mV (Mellor et al., 1998Mellor J.R. Merlo D. Jones A. Wisden W. Randall A.D. Mouse cerebellar granule cell differentiation: electrical activity regulates the GABAA receptor alpha 6 subunit gene.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2822-2833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figures 1C–1E). After 6 hr, the abundance of Nrxn1 4(−) mRNA was increased nearly 10-fold as measured by quantitative PCR (n = 4, p < 0.01, Figure 1D). This was accompanied by a decrease in the Nrxn1 4(+) and total Nrxn1 transcript indicating that in addition to the increase of Nrxn1 4(−) also the turnover of the preexisting Nrxn1 mRNA might be altered by depolarization (Figure 1D). Using a semiquantitative PCR assay with flanking primers we found that transcripts from all three neurexin genes (Nrxn1, 2, 3) each responded similarly to depolarization (n = 4, p < 0.001, Figures 1C and 1E). The shift in Nrxn1 alternative splicing was detectable upon a depolarizing stimulus of 30 min and was reversible, as Nrxn1 4(−) levels returned to baseline 48 hr after stimulation (Figures S2A and S2B ). To explore whether alternative splicing was controlled by neuronal activity we stimulated glutamate receptors by application of kainic acid (50 μM for 6 hr) or applied electrical field stimulation (3 × 3 min at 200 Hz spaced by 7 min intervals). Both paradigms produced a significant increase in Nrxn1 and Nrxn2 4(−) mRNA (for electrical stimulation n ≥ 7, p < 0.05, Figure 1F). Nrxn3 4(−) was not significantly upregulated in response to electrical stimulation. The activity-dependent alternative splicing shift in Nrxn1 AS4 was further confirmed by quantitative PCR (Rq Nrxn1 4(−)/Gapdh increased 2.4 ± 0.4-fold compared to nonstimulated control, n = 6, p = 0.004). Importantly, depolarization did not significantly alter exon incorporation at the neighboring alternatively spliced segments 3 and 5 in Nrxn1 (Figure S2C). This highlights site-selective activity-dependent splicing regulation for Nrxn1 AS4 in cerebellar neurons. We assessed the effects of pharmacological inhibitors to obtain insight into the signaling mechanisms underlying the regulation of Nrxns at AS4. Blockade of voltage-gated calcium channels by 20 μM Cd2+ or the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blocker nifedipine abolished the depolarization-dependent splicing shifts (n = 4, p < 0.01, Figure 2A ). The depolarization-induced increase in the Nrxn1 4(−) isoform was abolished by application of the CaMK inhibitors KN-62 and KN-93 (n = 5, p < 0.01, Figure 2B). By contrast, inhibitors of the MAP-Kinases MEK1 and MEK2 (U0126) and calcineurin (FK506) had no significant effect on depolarization-dependent Nrxn splicing regulation (Figure S2D). When cells were treated with actinomycin D during stimulation no increase in the Nrxn 4(−) splice variant was observed, demonstrating a requirement for ongoing transcription (Figure S2D). KN-62 and KN-93 inhibit CaMKs but also affect other kinases and neuronal receptors (Wayman et al., 2008Wayman G.A. Lee Y.S. Tokumitsu H. Silva A.J. Soderling T.R. Calmodulin-kinases: modulators of neuronal development and plasticity.Neuron. 2008; 59: 914-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Therefore, we further examined the involvement of the CaMK pathway by inhibiting CaMK kinases with STO-609 (Tokumitsu et al., 2002Tokumitsu H. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Ikeda M. Saji I. Kobayashi R. STO-609, a specific inhibitor of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15813-15818Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) or by RNA interference knockdown of CaMKIV, the dominant nuclear CaMK isoform in granule neurons (Ohmstede et al., 1989Ohmstede C.A. Jensen K.F. Sahyoun N.E. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase enriched in cerebellar granule cells. Identification of a novel neuronal calmodulin-dependent protein kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both treatments reduced depolarization-induced alternative splicing (n ≥ 7, STO609: p < 0.01, siCaMKIV: p = 0.02, Figure 2B). These experiments uncover a depolarization-induced, calcium- and CaMKIV-dependent mechanism for alternative splicing of Nrxn1. Alternative splicing of Nrxns at AS4 regulates adhesive interactions with synaptic receptors (Figure 2C). NRX1 4(−) but not NRX1 4(+) forms strong trans-synaptic adhesion complexes with the neuroligin-1B receptor (NL1B) (Dean et al., 2003Dean C. Scholl F.G. Choih J. DeMaria S. Berger J. Isacoff E.

To test whether the depolarization-induced alternative splicing switch in Nrxns translates into altered trans-synaptic signaling we employed a coculture system where primary neurons are combined with non-neuronal cells expressing a single postsynaptic receptor isoform (Scheiffele et al., 2000Scheiffele P.

Neuroligin expressed in nonneuronal cells triggers presynaptic development in contacting axons.Cell. 2000; 101: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). NL1B-expressing HEK293 cells induced only low levels of presynaptic differentiation as measured by the accumulation of the synaptic vesicle marker vGluT1 (Figure 2D). By contrast, GluD2-expressing cells triggered robust recruitment of this marker. These findings are consistent with weak functional coupling between NL1B and NRX1 4(+), the primary Nrxn1 isoform expressed in unstimulated granule cells, and strong coupling of NRX1 4(+) to the Cbln1-GluD2 complex. When granule cells were maintained under depolarizing conditions, the response to NL1B-expressing cells was strongly increased and responses to GluD2 were reduced (Figures 2D, 2F, and S2E). Interestingly, this reduction in GluD2 responses is likely due to both, a change in Nrxn1 alternative splicing but also reduced expression of Cbln1, a critical component of the tripartite NRX-Cbln1-GluD2 complex (Figure S2E) (Matsuda et al., 2010Matsuda K.

Inhibition of the CaMK pathway by addition of STO609 suppressed not only Nrxn1 4(−) production but also depolarization-induced responsiveness to NL1B (n = 35 cells per condition, p < 0.001, Figures 2E and 2F). By contrast, inhibition of calcineurin, another calcium-dependent signaling molecule activated in depolarized granule cells had no effect on NL1B-induced presynaptic differentiation (FK506, Figures 2E and 2F). To confirm that the altered presynaptic assembly in depolarized cells was indeed due to neurexin-receptor binding specificities we compared the induction of presynaptic structures with the NL1A isoform which exhibits similar adhesion and binding affinities for both, NRX1 4(+) and NRX1 4(−) (Boucard et al., 2005Boucard A.A.

Presynaptic differentiation induced by NL1A did not differ significantly between nondepolarized and depolarized granule cells (n = 37 cells per condition, p = 0.29, Figures 2E and 2F), highlighting that the depolarization-induced increase in presynaptic assembly in response to NL1 is dependent on the identity of the postsynaptic neuroligin receptor isoform. To identify RNA-binding proteins that regulate Nrxn1 alternative splicing, we established an assay in heterologous cells. A splice reporter spanning Nrxn1 AS4 (Nrxn1-4, exons 19–21, Figure 3A ) primarily produced the Nrxn1 4(+) splice isoform when transfected into HEK293 cells, therefore providing an assay to identify proteins that promote exon 20 skipping. A survey of the intronic sequences flanking exon 20 revealed AU-rich sequence elements reminiscent of binding sites for the RNA-binding protein SAM68 (Lin et al., 1997Lin Q. Taylor S.J. Shalloway D.

Stress, aging and the chronic expression of misfolded proteins, however, challenge the proteostasis machinery and the vitality of the cell. Enhanced expression of molecular chaperones, regulated by heat shock transcription factor-1 (HSF-1), has been shown to restore proteostasis in a variety of conformational disease models, suggesting this mechanism as a promising therapeutic approach. We describe the results of a screen comprised of ∼900,000 small molecules that identified new classes of small-molecule proteostasis regulators that induce HSF-1-dependent chaperone expression and restore protein folding in multiple conformational disease models. These beneficial effects to proteome stability are mediated by HSF-1, FOXO, Nrf-2 and the chaperone machinery through mechanisms that are distinct from current known small-molecule activators of the heat shock response. We suggest that modulation of the proteostasis network by proteostasis regulators may be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of a variety of protein conformational diseases."

In this study, we investigated a new approach to GBM treatment using therapeutic stem cells encapsulated in biodegradable, synthetic extracellular matrix (sECM) in mouse models of human GBM resection. Using multimodal imaging, we first showed quantitative surgical debulking of human GBM tumors in mice, which resulted in increased survival. Next, sECM encapsulation of engineered stem cells increased their retention in the tumor resection cavity, permitted tumor-selective migration and release of diagnostic and therapeutic proteins in vivo. Simulating the clinical scenario of GBM treatment, the release of tumor-selective S-TRAIL (secretable tumor necrosis factor apoptosis inducing ligand) from sECM-encapsulated stem cells in the resection cavity eradicated residual tumor cells by inducing caspase-mediated apoptosis, delayed tumor regrowth and significantly increased survival of mice. This study demonstrates the efficacy of encapsulated therapeutic stem cells in mouse models of GBM resection and may have implications for developing effective therapies for GBM."
https://openalex.org/W2116294169,"Nicholas Hayward and colleagues sequenced eight metastatic melanoma exomes and identified frequent somatic mutations in two MAP kinase family genes, MAP3K5 and MAP3K9. Mutation in MAP3K9 may confer resistance to temozolomide, a common chemotherapeutic drug. We sequenced eight melanoma exomes to identify new somatic mutations in metastatic melanoma. Focusing on the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family, we found that 24% of melanoma cell lines have mutations in the protein-coding regions of either MAP3K5 or MAP3K9. Structural modeling predicted that mutations in the kinase domain may affect the activity and regulation of these protein kinases. The position of the mutations and the loss of heterozygosity of MAP3K5 and MAP3K9 in 85% and 67% of melanoma samples, respectively, together suggest that the mutations are likely to be inactivating. In in vitro kinase assays, MAP3K5 I780F and MAP3K9 W333* variants had reduced kinase activity. Overexpression of MAP3K5 or MAP3K9 mutants in HEK293T cells reduced the phosphorylation of downstream MAP kinases. Attenuation of MAP3K9 function in melanoma cells using siRNA led to increased cell viability after temozolomide treatment, suggesting that decreased MAP3K pathway activity can lead to chemoresistance in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W1972414581,"Maintenance of a hematopoietic progenitor population requires extensive interaction with cells within a microenvironment or niche. In the Drosophila hematopoietic organ, niche-derived Hedgehog signaling maintains the progenitor population. Here, we show that the hematopoietic progenitors also require a signal mediated by Adenosine deaminase growth factor A (Adgf-A) arising from differentiating cells that regulates extracellular levels of adenosine. The adenosine signal opposes the effects of Hedgehog signaling within the hematopoietic progenitor cells and the magnitude of the adenosine signal is kept in check by the level of Adgf-A secreted from differentiating cells. Our findings reveal signals arising from differentiating cells that are required for maintaining progenitor cell quiescence and that function with the niche-derived signal in maintaining the progenitor state. Similar homeostatic mechanisms are likely to be utilized in other systems that maintain relatively large numbers of progenitors that are not all in direct contact with the cells of the niche."
https://openalex.org/W2160855062,"Prolonged seizures [status epilepticus (SE)] constitute a neurological emergency that can permanently damage the brain. SE results from a failure of the normal mechanisms to terminate seizures; in particular, γ-amino butyric acid-mediated inhibition, and benzodiazepine anticonvulsants are often incompletely effective. ATP acts as a fast neurotransmitter via ionotropic ligand-gated P2X receptors. Here we report that SE induced by intra-amygdala kainic acid in mice selectively increased hippocampal levels of P2X7 receptors relative to other P2X receptors. Using transgenic P2X7 reporter mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein, we identify dentate granule neurons as the major cell population transcribing the P2X7 receptor after SE. Pretreatment of mice with an intracerebroventricular microinjection of 1.75 nmol A438079, a P2X7 receptor antagonist, reduced seizure duration by 58% and reduced seizure-induced neuronal death by 61%. Injection of brilliant blue G (1 pmol), another selective antagonist, reduced seizure duration by 48% and was also neuroprotective. A438079 was seizure-suppressive when injected shortly after induction of SE, and coinjection of A438079 with lorazepam 60 min after triggering SE, when electrographic seizure-responsiveness to lorazepam had decreased, also terminated SE. Our results suggest that P2X7 receptor antagonists may be a promising class of drug for seizure abrogation and neuroprotection in SE."
https://openalex.org/W2083323375,"In eukaryotic cells, the spatial regulation of protein expression is frequently conferred through the coupling of mRNA localization and the local control of translation. mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a prominent example of such regulation and serves a ubiquitous role in segregating the synthesis of secretory and integral membrane proteins to the ER. Recent genomic and biochemical studies have now expanded this view to suggest a more substantial role for the ER cellular protein synthesis. We have utilized cell fractionation and ribosome profiling to obtain a genomic survey of the subcellular organization of mRNA translation and report that ribosomal loading of mRNAs, a proxy for mRNA translation, is biased to the ER. Notably, ER-associated mRNAs encoding both cytosolic and topogenic signal-encoding proteins display similar ribosome loading densities, suggesting that ER-associated ribosomes serve a global role in mRNA translation. We propose that the partitioning of mRNAs and their translation between the cytosol and ER compartments may represent a novel mechanism for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression."

This study investigates the role of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) within this action. In the lung cancer cell lines A549, H358, and H460, cannabidiol (CBD; 0.001-3 μM) elicited concentration-dependent ICAM-1 up-regulation compared to vehicle via cannabinoid receptors, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Up-regulation of ICAM-1 mRNA by CBD in A549 was 4-fold at 3 μM, with significant effects already evident at 0.01 μM. ICAM-1 induction became significant after 2 h, whereas significant TIMP-1 mRNA increases were observed only after 48 h. Inhibition of ICAM-1 by antibody or siRNA approaches reversed the anti-invasive and TIMP-1-upregulating action of CBD and the likewise ICAM-1-inducing cannabinoids Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and R(+)-methanandamide when compared to isotype or nonsilencing siRNA controls. ICAM-1-dependent anti-invasive cannabinoid effects were confirmed in primary tumor cells from a lung cancer patient. In athymic nude mice, CBD elicited a 2.6- and 3.0-fold increase of ICAM-1 and TIMP-1 protein in A549 xenografts, as compared to vehicle-treated animals, and an antimetastatic effect that was fully reversed by a neutralizing antibody against ICAM-1 [% metastatic lung nodules vs. isotype control (100%): 47.7% for CBD + isotype antibody and 106.6% for CBD + ICAM-1 antibody]. Overall, our data indicate that cannabinoids induce ICAM-1, thereby conferring TIMP-1 induction and subsequent decreased cancer cell invasiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2004577874,"Compounds containing a primary amino group can protect against light-induced retinal degeneration in a mouse model of Stargardt’s disease and age-related retinal degeneration by forming a transient Schiff base with all-trans-retinal, lowering its intracellular concentration and preventing accumulation of lipofuscin chromophores in the eye. Vertebrate vision is initiated by photoisomerization of the visual pigment chromophore 11-cis-retinal and is maintained by continuous regeneration of this retinoid through a series of reactions termed the retinoid cycle. However, toxic side reaction products, especially those involving reactive aldehyde groups of the photoisomerized product, all-trans-retinal, can cause severe retinal pathology. Here we lowered peak concentrations of free all-trans-retinal with primary amine–containing Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved drugs that did not inhibit chromophore regeneration in mouse models of retinal degeneration. Schiff base adducts between all-trans-retinal and these amines were identified by MS. Adducts were observed in mouse eyes only when an experimental drug protected the retina from degeneration in both short-term and long-term treatment experiments. This study demonstrates a molecular basis of all-trans-retinal–induced retinal pathology and identifies an assemblage of FDA-approved compounds with protective effects against this pathology in a mouse model that shows features of Stargardt's disease and age-related retinal degeneration."

Their synthesis takes mere seconds, leaving minimal time for recognition by the machinery for cotranslational protein translocation into the ER. The pathway taken by these substrates to enter the ER is not known. Here, we show that both in vivo and in vitro, small secretory proteins can enter the ER posttranslationally via a transient cytosolic intermediate. This intermediate contained calmodulin selectively bound to the signal peptides of small secretory proteins. Calmodulin maintained the translocation competence of small-protein precursors, precluded their aggregation and degradation, and minimized their inappropriate interactions with other cytosolic polypeptide-binding proteins. Acute inhibition of calmodulin specifically impaired small-protein translocation in vitro and in cells. These findings establish a mammalian posttranslational pathway for small-protein secretion and identify an unexpected role for calmodulin in chaperoning these precursors safely through the cytosol."

To address this question, we sought to dissociate these two activities. We uncoupled the function of syt1 in exo- and endocytosis in mouse neurons either by re-targeting the protein or via mutagenesis of its tandem C2 domains. The effect of these manipulations on exo- and endocytosis were analyzed using electrophysiology, in conjunction with optical imaging of the vesicle cycle. Our results indicate that syt1 is directly involved in endocytosis. Notably, either of the C2 domains of syt1, C2A or C2B, was able to function as a Ca(2+) sensor for endocytosis. Thus, syt1 functions as a dual Ca(2+) sensor for both endo- and exocytosis, potentially coupling these two components of the vesicle cycle."

We employed human mammary cells and two stimuli: epidermal growth factor (EGF), which induced cellular migration, and serum factors, which stimulated cell growth. In addition to strong activation of ERK by EGF, and AKT by serum, early transcription remarkably differed: while EGF induced early growth response-1 (EGR1), and this was required for migration, serum induced c-Fos and FosB to enhance proliferation. We demonstrate that induction of EGR1 involves ERK-mediated down-regulation of microRNA-191 and phosphorylation of the ETS2 repressor factor (ERF) repressor, which subsequently leaves the nucleus. Unexpectedly, knockdown of ERF inhibited migration, which implies migratory roles for exported ERF molecules. On the other hand, chromatin immunoprecipitation identified a subset of direct EGR1 targets, including EGR1 autostimulation and SERPINB2, whose transcription is essential for EGF-induced cell migration. In summary, EGR1 and the EGF-ERK-ERF axis emerge from our study as major drivers of growth factor-induced mammary cell migration."

Elongation of very long chain fatty acids-4 (ELOVL4) has been identified as a fatty acid elongase protein involved in the synthesis of VLC-PUFAs. Mutations in ELOVL4 have also been implicated in an autosomal dominant form of Stargardt disease (STGD3), a type of juvenile macular degeneration. We have generated photoreceptor-specific conditional knock-out mice and used high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) to examine and analyze the fatty acid composition of retinal membrane glycerophosphatidylcholine and glycerophosphatidylethanolamine species. We also used immunofluorescent staining and histology coupled with electrophysiological data to assess retinal morphology and visual response. The conditional knock-out mice showed a significant decrease in retinal glycerophospholipids containing VLC-PUFAs, specifically contained in the sn-1 position of glycerophosphatidylcholine, implicating the role of Elovl4 in their synthesis. Conditional knock-out mice were also found to have abnormal accumulation of lipid droplets and lipofuscin-like granules while demonstrating photoreceptor-specific abnormalities in visual response, indicating the critical role of Elovl4 for proper rod or cone photoreceptor function. Altogether, this study demonstrates the essential role of ELOVL4 in VLC-PUFA synthesis and retinal function."

Previous findings suggest that the protein kinase A (PKA) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascades are necessary to induce long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF) in Aplysia, a neuronal correlate of memory. We developed a computational model of the PKA and ERK cascades and used it to identify a training protocol that maximized PKA and ERK interactions. In vitro studies confirmed that the protocol enhanced LTF. Moreover, the protocol enhanced the levels of phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB1. Behavioral training confirmed that long-term memory also was enhanced by the protocol. These results illustrate the feasibility of using computational models to design training protocols that improve memory."
https://openalex.org/W2016987246,"Mammalian zinc finger protein Ars2 is revealed as a sequence-specific transcription factor that promotes the self-renewal of postnatal and adult neural stem cells by directly activating transcription of the pluripotency factor Sox2. The zinc finger protein Ars2 (arsenite-resistance protein 2) is known for its role in microRNA biogenesis. A previously unknown function for Ars2 has now been identified: it acts as a sequence-specific transcription factor to promote self-renewal of neural stem cells in the adult mouse brain. The process is RNA-independent, proceeding through activation of the pluripotency factor Sox2. Fundamental questions remain unanswered about the transcriptional networks that control the identity and self-renewal of neural stem cells (NSCs), a specialized subset of astroglial cells that are endowed with stem properties and neurogenic capacity. Here we report that the zinc finger protein Ars2 (arsenite-resistance protein 2; also known as Srrt) is expressed by adult NSCs from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of mice, and that selective knockdown of Ars2 in cells expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein within the adult SVZ depletes the number of NSCs and their neurogenic capacity. These phenotypes are recapitulated in the postnatal SVZ of hGFAP-cre::Ars2fl/fl conditional knockout mice, but are more severe. Ex vivo assays show that Ars2 is necessary and sufficient to promote NSC self-renewal, and that it does so by positively regulating the expression of Sox2. Although plant1,2,3 and animal4,5 orthologues of Ars2 are known for their conserved roles in microRNA biogenesis, we unexpectedly observed that Ars2 retains its capacity to promote self-renewal in Drosha and Dicer1 knockout NSCs. Instead, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that Ars2 binds a specific region within the 6-kilobase NSC enhancer of Sox2. This association is RNA-independent, and the region that is bound is required for Ars2-mediated activation of Sox2. We used gel-shift analysis to refine the Sox2 region bound by Ars2 to a specific conserved DNA sequence. The importance of Sox2 as a critical downstream effector is shown by its ability to restore the self-renewal and multipotency defects of Ars2 knockout NSCs. Our findings reveal Ars2 as a new transcription factor that controls the multipotent progenitor state of NSCs through direct activation of the pluripotency factor Sox2."

https://openalex.org/W2171115168,"Bone diseases such as postmenopausal osteoporosis are primarily caused by excessive formation and activity of osteoclasts (OCLs). Receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) is a key initiating cytokine for OCL differentiation and function. RANKL induces calcium (Ca(2+)) oscillations, resulting in selective and robust induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), a Ca(2+)-responsive transcription factor that drives osteoclastogenesis. Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) is a major Ca(2+) influx pathway in most nonexcitable cell types and is activated by any stimulus that depletes Ca(2+) stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. Although the role of Orai1, a SOCE channel in the plasma membrane, in maintaining Ca(2+) oscillations and transactivation of NFAT in other cell types is well known, its contribution to osteoclastogenesis remains unclear. We show here that silencing of the Orai1 gene with viral delivery of shRNA reduces SOCE and inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis of RAW264.7 cells, a murine monocyte/macrophage cell line, by suppressing the induction of NFATc1. This was accompanied by defective induction of OCL-specific genes, such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and immunoreceptor OCL-associated receptor, which are known to be direct transcriptional targets of NFATc1 during osteoclastogenesis. In addition, maturation of OCLs was abrogated by defective cell fusion of pre-OCLs depleted of Orai1, consistent with defective RANKL-mediated induction of d2 isoform of vacuolar ATPase V(o) domain that is involved in cell fusion of pre-OCLs. We found that the functional bone resorbing capacity was severely impaired in OCLs depleted of Orai1, potentially related to the observed decrease in the induction of cathepsin K, a major bone matrix degrading protease. Our results indicate that Orai1 plays a critical role in the differentiation and function of OCLs, suggesting that Orai1 might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment or prevention of bone loss caused by OCLs."

Ogura T. Hiraga S. Effects of the ccd function of the F plasmid on bacterial growth.J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 841-849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Active toxin may cause cell death to prevent loss of the plasmid within the population, or it may inhibit cell growth to allow the levels of the plasmid to return to normal. TA systems have also been found in bacterial chromosomes, and at present there has been considerable debate about the role of these systems in cell physiology with several hypotheses being presented (3.Magnuson R.D. Hypothetical functions of toxin-antitoxin systems.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 6089-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). There are three types of TA systems, and they differ primarily in the interactions between the toxin and the antitoxin to form the benign complex. In type I TA systems, such as the Hok/Sok system of plasmid R1, the antitoxin is a small RNA that inhibits the mRNA of the toxin. The complex in type II systems is composed of two proteins, and the toxic protein of the type III system is inhibited by the antitoxic RNA (4.Fineran P.C. Blower T.R. Foulds I.J. Humphreys D.P. Lilley K.S. Salmond G.P. The phage abortive infection system, ToxIN, functions as a protein-RNA toxin-antitoxin pair.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nine families of toxins have been characterized for the type II TA systems (5.Gerdes K. Christensen S.K. Løbner-Olesen A. Prokaryotic toxin-antitoxin stress-response loci.Nat. Rev.

All three of these toxins cleave mRNA; RelE requires the ribosome for RNA cleavage, whereas MazF, HigB, and VapC do not (7.Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M.

The CcdB and ParE toxins inhibit chromosome replication through DNA gyrase (11.Jiang Y. Pogliano J. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I.

Molecular mechanisms of HipA-mediated multidrug tolerance and its neutralization by HipB.Science. 2009; 323: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Even though the toxins target important components of the cell, the role of chromosomally encoded TA systems has been difficult to determine as the phenotypes appear to be pleiotropic. A five TA deletion strain has been created in Escherichia coli where the mazEF, relBE, yefM-yoeB, chpB, and dinJ-yafQ TA systems have been deleted (16.Tsilibaris V. Maenhaut-Michel G. Mine N. Van Melderen L. What is the benefit to Escherichia coli of having multiple toxin-antitoxin systems in its genome?.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 6101-6108Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). No phenotypic difference was found in response to stress and recovery responses. However, when Kim et al. (17.Kim Y. Wang X. Ma Q. Zhang X.S. Wood T.K. Toxin-antitoxin systems in Escherichia coli influence biofilm formation through YjgK (TabA) and fimbriae.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1258-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) investigated the role of TA systems in biofilms, they found that this five TA deletion strain had reduced initial biofilm formation and reduced biofilm dispersal. Each of the five TA systems was found to play a different role in the process of forming biofilms, with MazF appearing to be the main effector in the network (18.Kolodkin-Gal I. Verdiger R. Shlosberg-Fedida A. Engelberg-Kulka H. A differential effect of E. coli toxin-antitoxin systems on cell death in liquid media and biofilm formation.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e6785Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Several studies have been performed to identify TA systems in the chromosomes of sequenced bacteria and archaea (19.Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Toxin-antitoxin loci are highly abundant in free-living but lost from host-associated prokaryotes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 20.Anantharaman V. Aravind L. New connections in the prokaryotic toxin-antitoxin network. Relationship with the eukaryotic nonsense-mediated RNA decay system.Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest a large amount of diversity in the number of TA systems in each genome. One group that is of interest is the genus Mycobacterium. The number of TA systems in the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been greatly expanded with 88 putative TA systems present (19.Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Toxin-antitoxin loci are highly abundant in free-living but lost from host-associated prokaryotes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 21.Ramage H.R.

Implications for pathogenesis, stress responses, and evolution.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000767Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In contrast, the chromosome of Mycobacterium leprae contains only toxin pseudogenes, whereas Mycobacterium smegmatis contains only three TA systems (19.Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Toxin-antitoxin loci are highly abundant in free-living but lost from host-associated prokaryotes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 22.Robson J. McKenzie J.L. Cursons R. Cook G.M. Arcus V.L. The vapBC operon from Mycobacterium smegmatis is an autoregulated toxin-antitoxin module that controls growth via inhibition of translation.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 390: 353-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The greatest number of TA modules in M. tuberculosis belongs to VapBC with 47 in total. The vapBC family of TA systems consists of the antitoxin VapB and the toxin VapC, which is proposed to be an RNase. This family has recently been reviewed (23.Arcus V.L. McKenzie J.L. Robson J. Cook G.M. The PIN-domain ribonucleases and the prokaryotic VapBC toxin-antitoxin array.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2011; 24: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). There are examples where VapBC systems have been shown to play a role in the adaptation of the bacteria to an environmental niche (e.g. epithelial cells and root nodules) (24.Hopper S. Wilbur J.S. Vasquez B.L. Larson J. Clary S. Mehr I.J. Seifert H.S. So M. Isolation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae mutants that show enhanced trafficking across polarized T84 epithelial monolayers.Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 896-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To provide a molecular model for understanding the role of TA systems in mycobacteria, we have characterized all three TA systems in M. smegmatis at a molecular level. We show that all three TA systems are bona fide TA modules, and deleting all three (vapBC-mazEF-phd/doc) in M. smegmatis leads to a survival defect in complex growth medium. All strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C with agitation (200 rpm). M. smegmatis strain mc2155 and derived strains were routinely grown at 37 °C, 200 rpm in LB containing 0.05% (w/v) Tween 80 (LBT), in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) supplemented with 10% albumin/glucose/catalase enrichment (ADC; BD Biosciences) and 0.05% (w/v) Tween 80, or in modified Hartmans de Bont medium (HdB) (25.Smeulders M.J. Keer J. Speight R.A. Williams H.D. Adaptation of Mycobacterium smegmatis to stationary phase.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 270-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The composition of this medium per liter was as follows: 10 ml of trace metals, 27.4 mm glycerol, 15 mm ammonium sulfate, 21 mm Na2HPO4, and 11 mm KH2PO4 and 0.05% Tween 80. For nutrient limitation studies, glycerol was reduced to 11 mm for carbon limitation, ammonium sulfate reduced 100-fold for nitrogen limitation, and Na2HPO4 and K2HPO4 reduced 100-fold for phosphate limitation. During phosphate limitation, the buffering capacity of the medium was increased by the addition of 50 mm MOPS.TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyDescriptionaThe following abbreviations are used: Gmr, gentamicin resistance; Hygr, hygromycin B resistance; Kmr, kanamycin resistance; Apr, ampicillin resistance; Strepr, streptomycin resistance; Specr, spectomycin resistance; Sacs, sucrose sensitivity; ts, temperature sensitivity.Source or ref.Bacterial strains E. coliDH10BF− mcrAΔ(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) φ80dlacZΔM15 ΔlacX74deoRrecA1 araD139Δ(araleu)7697galUgalKrpsLendA1nupG77.Hanahan D.

Open table in a new tab M. smegmatis transformants were grown at 28 °C for propagation of temperature-sensitive vectors and at 40 °C for allelic exchange mutagenesis. Selective media contained kanamycin (50 μg ml−1 for E. coli; 20 μg ml−1 for M. smegmatis), gentamicin (20 μg ml−1 for E. coli; 5 μg ml−1 for M. smegmatis), hygromycin B (200 μg ml−1 for E. coli; 50 μg ml−1 for M. smegmatis), spectinomycin (50 μg ml−1 for E. coli), streptomycin (50 μg ml−1 for E. coli, 20 μg ml−1 for M. smegmatis), and ampicillin (100 μg ml−1 for E. coli). Solid media contained 1.5% agar. Growth curves were performed in triplicate in LBT and HdB. Bacterial cell viability was monitored by cell counts based on cfu ml−1 where serial dilutions of bacterial cell culture in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% (w/v) Tween 80 (PBS-T) were spread onto LBT agar plates supplemented with appropriate antibiotics. For adaptation to hypoxia experiments, 100-ml serum vials were used, containing 30 ml of LBT or HdB. For iron limitation the iron chelator, ethylenediamine-N,N′-bis(2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid), was added to media at a final concentration of 10 μm, and to supplement the media with extra iron, iron sulfate was added to a final concentration of 100 μm. External pH of cultures was measured using pH indicator strips (4.0–7.0 or 7.5–14.0; Merck). Absorbance was measured at 600 nm (A600) using culture samples diluted in saline to bring A600 to below 0.5 when measuring in cuvettes of 1-cm light path length in a Jenway 6300 spectrophotometer. Genomic DNA from M. smegmatis was isolated using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method (26.Bull T.J. Hermon-Taylor J. Pavlik I. El-Zaatari F. Tizard M. Characterization of IS900 loci in Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis and development of multiplex PCR typing.Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2185-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Restriction or DNA-modifying enzymes and other molecular biology reagents were obtained from Roche Diagnostics or New England Biolabs. All primers used in this study are shown in supplemental Table S1. The tetracycline-inducible expression construct for mazF was made by amplifying the gene using primers mazFpSE100 F and mazFpSE100 R. This product was ligated into the BamHI/PstI sites of pSE100 (27.Guo X.V. Monteleone M. Klotzsche M. Kamionka A. Hillen W. Braunstein M. Ehrt S. Schnappinger D. Silencing Mycobacterium smegmatis by using tetracycline repressors.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4614-4623Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (Addgene plasmid 17972), creating plasmid pRF202. This was also done for the mazEF operon using primers mazEFpSE100 F and mazFpSE100 R, and this created plasmid pRF203. Plasmids pRF202 and pRF203 were electroporated into mc2155 with pMC1s (28.Ehrt S. Guo X.V. Hickey C.M. Ryou M. Monteleone M. Riley L.W. Schnappinger D. Controlling gene expression in mycobacteria with anhydrotetracycline and Tet repressor.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e21Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), which integrates into the attB site. The primers docpMind F and docpMind R were used to amplify the doc gene, and this product was ligated into the BamHI/SpeI sites of pMind (29.Blokpoel M.C. Murphy H.N. O'Toole R. Wiles S. Runn E.S. Stewart G.R. Young D.B. Robertson B.D. Tetracycline-inducible gene regulation in mycobacteria.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e22Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), creating pRF200. The phd/doc operon was amplified using primers phd/docpMind F and docpMind R. This product was also ligated into the BamHI/SpeI sites of pMind, creating pRF201. To create a construct for the deletion of MSMEG_4447 and MSMEG_4448 (mazEF), PCR products of ∼850 bp flanking the mazEF genes of M. smegmatis were amplified using the primer mazEFKOLF F with primer mazEFKOLF R (left flank) and primer mazEFKORF F with primer mazEFKO RF R (right flank). Primer mazEFKOLF R and primer mazEFKORF F contain 7-bp overlapping regions. The left flank and right flank PCR products were used in a second PCR with primer mazEFKOLF F and primer mazEFKORF R to generate an overlapping PCR product of the mazEF flanking regions with 88% of the genes deleted. This PCR product was digested with SpeI and ligated into the SpeI site of the pBluescript II KS plasmid. The insert was then subcloned into pX33 (30.Gebhard S. Tran S.L. Cook G.M. The Phn system of Mycobacterium smegmatis. A second high-affinity ABC transporter for phosphate.Microbiology. 2006; 152: 3453-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) generating the pRF220 plasmid. Allelic replacement was carried out essentially as described previously (31.Pelicic V. Reyrat J.M. Gicquel B.

Incubation at 40 °C selected for integration of the entire deletion construct into the chromosome of M. smegmatis via a single crossover event at either the left or right flank. Colonies that formed a yellow product when exposed to 250 mm catechol because of the presence of the xylE marker were screened by Southern hybridization analysis for correct integration of the construct. One integrant was chosen and grown in LBT with gentamicin at 37 °C, 200 rpm to an A600 of ∼0.5, followed by plating onto low salt LBT plates (2 g of NaCl liter−1) containing 10% sucrose and incubated at 40 °C to select for a second crossover event resulting in loss of the plasmid and replacement of mazEF with the overlapping flanks. Colonies that did not form the yellow product after exposure to catechol were picked onto LBT plates to confirm loss of the plasmid backbone. Candidate clones were screened by Southern hybridization analysis for correct deletion of mazEF. Replacement of mazEF with the overlapping flanks created strain RF100 (ΔmazEF). To create a construct for the deletion of MSMEG_1277 and MSMEG_1278 (phd/doc), the kanamycin resistance (Kmr) cassette, encoded by aphA-3, was amplified from pUC18K (33.Ménard R. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. Nonpolar mutagenesis of the ipa genes defines IpaB, IpaC, and IpaD as effectors of Shigella flexneri entry into epithelial cells.J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5899-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) by using primers 5′mcspUC F and 3′mcspUC R. The resulting 850-bp product was digested with EcoRI and PstI. PCR products of ∼1000 bp flanking the phd/doc genes of M. smegmatis were amplified by using the primer phd/docKOLF F with primer phd/docKOLF R (left flank) and primer phd/docKORF F with primer phd/docKORF R (right flank). The left flank PCR product was digested with SpeI and EcoRI, and the right flank PCR product was digested with PstI and SpeI. Both flanking products and the kanamycin cassette were ligated into the SpeI site of the pBluescript II KS plasmid. The resulting assembly, left flank/Kmr/right flank, was subcloned as a SpeI fragment into pX33 (30.Gebhard S. Tran S.L. Cook G.M. The Phn system of Mycobacterium smegmatis. A second high-affinity ABC transporter for phosphate.Microbiology. 2006; 152: 3453-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) generating the pRF221 plasmid. The expected double crossover event would result in a nonpolar deletion insertion at the phd/doc locus, eliminating 73% of the phd/doc coding sequence in exchange for the kanamycin resistance marker. Allelic replacement of phd/doc was carried out essentially as described previously (32.Pelicic V. Jackson M. Reyrat J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Efficient allelic exchange and transposon mutagenesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 10955-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and was achieved by growing a culture of M. smegmatis carrying pRF221 in Middlebrook 7H9-ADC medium with kanamycin at 28 °C with agitation (200 rpm) to an A600 of ∼0.5, followed by plating onto low salt LBT plates (2 g NaCl liter−1) containing kanamycin and 10% sucrose at 40 °C, selecting for double crossover events. Replacement of phd/doc with the kanamycin marker created strain RF101 (Δphd/doc::aphA-3). To create a ΔmazEF ΔvapBC Δphd/doc triple mutant, a ΔmazEF ΔvapBC double mutant was made. Strain RF100 was transformed with pJR113 (22.Robson J. McKenzie J.L. Cursons R. Cook G.M. Arcus V.L. The vapBC operon from Mycobacterium smegmatis is an autoregulated toxin-antitoxin module that controls growth via inhibition of translation.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 390: 353-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the mutant was created as described previously, and this is strain RF102. This strain was then transformed with pRF221, and the triple mutant (ΔTAtriple; RF105) was created using the two-step crossover protocol. All crossover events were analyzed by Southern hybridization. For Southern hybridization analysis, EcoRI-digested genomic DNA (SmaI-digested genomic DNA was used for the creation of the ΔmazEF ΔvapBC double mutant) of the putative mutants was separated on a 0.8% agarose/Tris acetate/EDTA gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; Amersham Biosciences) by vacuum blotting. Probes were labeled using Gene Images AlkPhos Direct Labeling and Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). To create a transcriptional fusion of the mazEF operon, a PCR product encompassing 556 bp of DNA upstream of mazE and 107 bp of its coding region was amplified using the primers mazElac F and mazElac R.

MTDH has been detected at the plasma membrane as well as in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and the function of MTDH in these locales remains under investigation. In the nucleus, MTDH acts as a transcription co-factor to induce expression of chemoresistance-associated genes. However, MTDH is predominantly cytoplasmic in prostate tumors, and this localization correlates with poor prognosis. Herein, we used endometrial cancer cells as a model system to define a new role for MTDH in the cytoplasm. First, MTDH was primarily localized to the cytoplasm in endometrial cancer cells, and the N-terminal region of MTDH was required to maintain cytoplasmic localization. Next, we identified novel binding partners for cytoplasmic MTDH, including RNA-binding proteins and components of the RNA-induced silencing complex. Nucleic acids were required for the association of MTDH with these cytoplasmic proteins. Furthermore, MTDH interacted with and regulated protein expression of multiple mRNAs, such as PDCD10 and KDM6A. Depletion of cytoplasmic MTDH was associated with increased stress granule formation, reduced survival in response to chemotherapy and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor BIBF1120, Rad51 nuclear accumulation, and cell cycle arrest at G2/M. Finally, in vivo tumor formation was abrogated with knockdown of cytoplasmic MTDH. Taken together, our data identify a novel function for cytoplasmic MTDH as an RNA-binding protein. Our findings implicate cytoplasmic MTDH in cell survival and broad drug resistance via association with RNA and RNA-binding proteins.

Although the underlying mechanism by which MTDH confers chemoresistance has not been established, one possibility is that MTDH functions as a transcription co-factor to promote expression of genes involved in resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (3Hu G.

However, a complete understanding of the biological functions and biochemical characteristics of MTDH remains elusive to date, particularly the significance of differential MTDH subcellular localization. metadherin immunoprecipitation stress granule nuclear localization signal mitomycin C endoplasmic reticulum mammalian target of rapamycin. Subcellular distribution of endogenous and exogenous MTDH and exogenous MTDH fragments in Hec50 cells was detected by microscopy and electron microscope as described in the supplemental Methods. Nuclear Rad51 accumulation was assessed by staining with anti-Rad51 (Ab-1, Calbiochem). For stress granule formation, cells were subjected to no treatment or 45 °C heat shock for 10 or 15 min. FLAG-tagged full-length or fragments of MTDH were generated by PCR, cloned in pCMV6 (OriGene), and expressed in Hec50 cells transiently (Rad51 experiments) or stably by selection with G418. A stable cell line expressing FLAG-tagged MTDH that is resistant to MTDH shRNA was also established (see also the supplemental Methods). Stable MTDH or control shRNA Hec50 cells were established as reported previously (14Meng X. Brachova P. Yang S. Xiong Z. Zhang Y. Thiel K.W. Leslie K.K. Knockdown of MTDH sensitizes endometrial cancer cells to cell death induction by death receptor ligand TRAIL and HDAC inhibitor LBH589 co-treatment.PloS One. 2011; 6: e20920Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with mitomycin C (MMC) for 24 h and then cultured in normal medium for 2 weeks. Resulting colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted. Stable MTDH or control shRNA Hec50 cells were treated with BIBF1120 (LC Laboratories), and then viability was assessed with the WST-1 assay. Cell lysates from Hec50-FLAG-MTDH (with mutated shRNA binding site) transfected with MTDH shRNA or parental Hec50 cells were used to identify and validate MTDH-interacting proteins as described in the supplemental Methods. Where indicated, lysates were treated with Benzonase nuclease (50 units/ml, EMD Chemicals) prior to and during immunoprecipitation (IP). Magna RIPTM (RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation) kit and microarray were used to pull down MTDH-associated RNAs and to identify mRNAs that associate with MTDH in the absence or presence of 100 nm BEZ235 (LC Laboratories). The full list of RNAs associated with MTDH is provided in supplemental Tables 2–5. Microarray data have been deposited at GEO (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under accession number GSE30588. The cell cycle profile in control and MTDH-depleted Hec50 cells cultured in medium containing 10% FBS or 0.1% FBS for 2 days was analyzed by Click-iT EdU flow cytometry assay kits (Invitrogen). Total DNA was stained with FxCycleTM violet. For xenograft studies (15Dai D. Holmes A.M. Nguyen T. Davies S. Theele D.P. Verschraegen C. Leslie K.K. A potential synergistic anticancer effect of paclitaxel and amifostine on endometrial cancer.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9517-9524Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), 6–8-week-old athymic NCr-NU/NU female mice (NCI-Frederick, National Institutes of Health) were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 10 × 106 Hec50 cells in 100 μl of DMEM. Tumors were measured weekly, and the cross-sectional area (mm2) was calculated as length (mm) × width (mm) × π/4. The University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved experimental protocols. Expression of MTDH has been observed in the ER/perinuclear region, nucleus, and nucleolus and at the plasma membrane (3Hu G. Chong R.A. Yang Q. Wei Y. Blanco M.A. Li F. Reiss M. Au J.L. Haffty B.G.

Metadherin, a cell surface protein in breast tumors that mediates lung metastasis.Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 365-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In these studies, distribution depended on the cell types examined and the experimental approach. We therefore first investigated the relative subcellular localization of MTDH in multiple endometrial and ovarian cancer cell lines. MTDH was detected predominantly in the cytoplasm, although a low level of punctate staining was also detected in the nucleus of all tested endometrial and ovarian cancer cell lines, similar to early reports that MTDH is an ER/nuclear envelope-associated protein (16Sutherland H.G. Lam Y.W. Briers S. Lamond A.I. Bickmore W.A. 3D3/lyric: a novel transmembrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope, which is also present in the nucleolus.Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B, and supplemental Fig. 1). Other anti-MTDH antibodies that target the N and C terminus of MTDH were used to confirm subcellular distribution of MTDH (supplemental Fig. 2). Exogenously expressed FLAG-tagged MTDH was also localized in the cytoplasm as evidenced by staining with FLAG antibody (Fig. 1D). Several lines of evidence substantiate a critical function for MTDH in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. First, a previous study demonstrated that cytoplasmic MTDH correlates with poor prognosis or aggressive disease in prostate cancer patients (12Thirkettle H.J. Mills I.G. Whitaker H.C. Neal D.E. Nuclear LYRIC/AEG-1 interacts with PLZF and relieves PLZF-mediated repression.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 3663-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Second, MTDH has been reported to promote chemoresistance by facilitating translation of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1), which is involved in drug efflux (19Yoo B.K. Chen D. Su Z.Z. Gredler R. Yoo J. Shah K. Fisher P.B. Sarkar D. Molecular mechanism of chemoresistance by astrocyte elevated gene-1.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 3249-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Third, MTDH was shown to co-localize with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) component staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing-1 (SND1) (20Yoo B.K. Santhekadur P.K. Gredler R. Chen D. Emdad L. Bhutia S. Pannell L. Fisher P.B. Sarkar D. Increased RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) activity contributes to hepatocellular carcinoma.Hepatology. 2011; 53: 1538-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21Blanco M.A. Aleckovi M. Hua Y. Li T. Wei Y. Xu Z. Cristea I.M. Kang Y. Identification of staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing 1 (SND1) as a metadherin-interacting protein with metastasis-promoting functions.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 19982-19992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Finally, we recently reported that depletion of MTDH alters expression of several MTDH downstream genes, and MTDH is mainly cytoplasmic in the endometrial cancer cell lines used in this study (14Meng X. Brachova P. Yang S. Xiong Z. Zhang Y. Thiel K.W. Leslie K.K. Knockdown of MTDH sensitizes endometrial cancer cells to cell death induction by death receptor ligand TRAIL and HDAC inhibitor LBH589 co-treatment.PloS One. 2011; 6: e20920Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, MTDH contains three functional nuclear localization signals (NLSs) including residues 79–91, 432–451, and 561–580 (22Thirkettle H.J. Girling J. Warren A.Y. Mills I.G. Sahadevan K. Leung H. Hamdy F. Whitaker H.C. Neal D.E. LYRIC/AEG-1 is targeted to different subcellular compartments by ubiquitinylation and intrinsic nuclear localization signals.Clin Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 3003-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We investigated distribution of FLAG-tagged MTDH fragments with the different NLSs in Hec50 endometrial cancer cells. Full-length MTDH (MTDH 1–582) or MTDH truncated at the C terminus (MTDH 1–300 and 1–471) were all detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, D–F). However, MTDH fragments with an N-terminal deletion (MTDH 197–582, 300–582, and 471–582) were nuclear (Fig. 1, G–I). Our data indicate that the N terminus of MTDH (residues 1–197) may play a dominant role in MTDH localization in the cytoplasm. We hypothesized that deletion of the N-terminal region or regulation of this region by post-translation modification will release MTDH from the cytoplasmic membrane system and promote translocation to the nucleus. For example, cytoplasmic but not nuclear MTDH is monoubiquitinated (22Thirkettle H.J. Girling J. Warren A.Y. Mills I.G. Sahadevan K. Leung H. Hamdy F. Whitaker H.C. Neal D.E. LYRIC/AEG-1 is targeted to different subcellular compartments by ubiquitinylation and intrinsic nuclear localization signals.Clin Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 3003-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), indicating that MTDH subcellular distribution may be regulated by post-translation modification. MTDH phosphorylation at multiple sites, including Thr-143 (23Dephoure N. Zhou C. Villén J. Beausoleil S.A. Bakalarski C.E. Elledge S.J. Gygi S.P. A quantitative atlas of mitotic phosphorylation.Proc.

Signal. 2010; 3: ra3Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar), has been reported in mammalian cells (supplemental Fig. 3A), but no studies have examined how MTDH phosphorylation affects its distribution. We made several site-specific mutations at MTDH phosphorylation sites, but all of these mutants retained cytoplasmic localization (supplemental Fig. 3, B–D). To explore the function of cytoplasmic MTDH, we employed the strategy of FLAG-tagged MTDH co-IP coupled with mass spectrometry to identify novel MTDH-interacting proteins in the cytoplasm. A total of 64 potential MTDH-interacting proteins were thus identified (supplemental Table 1). The most represented proteins were ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4), nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), SND1, and MTDH (Fig. 2A). The interactions between SND1, NPM1, and RPL4 with MTDH were confirmed by co-IP (Fig. 2, B and C). The finding that SND1, which is part of RNA-induced silencing complex, interacts with MTDH is consistent with two recent studies that identified a metastatic role for the association of SND1 with MTDH (21Blanco M.A. Aleckovi M. Hua Y. Li T. Wei Y. Xu Z. Cristea I.M. Kang Y. Identification of staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing 1 (SND1) as a metadherin-interacting protein with metastasis-promoting functions.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 19982-19992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and a novel role for MTDH in RNAi-mediated gene silencing (20Yoo B.K. Santhekadur P.K. Gredler R. Chen D. Emdad L. Bhutia S. Pannell L. Fisher P.B. Sarkar D. Increased RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) activity contributes to hepatocellular carcinoma.Hepatology. 2011; 53: 1538-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, pretreatment of protein lysates with Benzonase nuclease, which degrades nucleic acids, disrupted the interaction of MTDH with SND1 and RPL4 (Fig. 2D), demonstrating that nucleic acids are required for MTDH association with these proteins. Mutation of phosphorylation sites in MTDH did not prevent association with SND1 and RPL4 (supplemental Fig. 4). Co-localization of MTDH and RPL4, as determined by immunofluorescence, was observed only in the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus (Fig. 2E). Our data indicate that MTDH associates with multiple cytoplasmic proteins, and this interaction is dependent on the presence of nucleic acids. SND1 was recently found to physiologically interact with G3BP, a component of stress granules (SGs) (27Gao X. Ge L. Shao J. Su C. Zhao H. Saarikettu J. Yao X. Yao Z. Silvennoinen O. Yang J. Tudor-SN interacts with and co-localizes with G3BP in stress granules under stress conditions.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 3525-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). SGs are dynamic dense structures that rapidly form in the cytosol in response to stress stimuli, such as heat shock and arsenite, and serve as a reservoir for nontranslated mRNAs (28Buchan J.R. Parker R. Eukaryotic stress granules: the ins and outs of translation.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 932-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Although cytosolic mRNAs such as actin aggregate into SGs in response to stress, there is a complete lack of localization of ER-associated transcripts such as MDR1 with SGs in arsenite-treated cells (29Yagüe E. Raguz S. Escape from stress granule sequestration: another way to drug resistance.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2010; 38: 1537-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 30Unsworth H. Raguz S. Edwards H.J. Higgins C.F. Yagüe E. mRNA escape from stress granule sequestration is dictated by localization to the endoplasmic reticulum.FASEB J. 2010; 24: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Importantly, mRNAs that escape from SGs resume translation faster than mRNAs aggregated in SGs, which may increase cellular resistance to stress (29Yagüe E. Raguz S. Escape from stress granule sequestration: another way to drug resistance.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2010; 38: 1537-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 30Unsworth H. Raguz S. Edwards H.J. Higgins C.F. Yagüe E. mRNA escape from stress granule sequestration is dictated by localization to the endoplasmic reticulum.FASEB J. 2010; 24: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Knockdown of endogenous SND1 retards aggregation of small SGs into large SGs, although it has no effect on SG formation (27Gao X. Ge L. Shao J. Su C. Zhao H. Saarikettu J. Yao X. Yao Z. Silvennoinen O. Yang J. Tudor-SN interacts with and co-localizes with G3BP in stress granules under stress conditions.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 3525-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Based on the observations that MTDH interacts with both SND1 and mRNAs, we tested whether MTDH regulates SG formation or aggregation. As shown in Fig. 2F, formation of SGs induced by 45 °C heat shock was significantly increased in MTDH knockdown Hec50 cells as compared with control shRNA-transfected cells, suggesting that MTDH prevents SG formation. Heat shock had no effect on MTDH levels in control shRNA-transfected cells (supplemental Fig. 5). Our data reveal a previously unrecognized cytoplasmic function of MTDH in stress granule formation. Because the interaction of MTDH with SND1, RPL4, or NPM1 depended on the presence of nucleic acid, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis to identify novel functional domains in MTDH. We found that MTDH has homology with the RNA-binding protein leucine tRNA synthase and contains several putative RNA binding domains (supplemental Figs. 6 and 7). Given the involvement of MTDH in RNA and protein complex formation, we therefore examined whether MTDH is a novel RNA-binding protein and whether it regulates translation of specific mRNAs. We conducted RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (31Zong X. Tripathi V. Prasanth K.V. RNA splicing control: yet another gene regulatory role for long nuclear noncoding RNAs.RNA Biol. 2011; 8: 968-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by microarray analysis (RIP-chip) to identify MTDH-associated mRNA targets. As shown in Fig. 3A and supplemental Tables 2–5, various mRNAs interacted with MTDH, and some of these encode proteins that are linked to chemoresistance, such as ABCA 12 (32Park S. Shimizu C. Shimoyama T. Takeda M. Ando M. Kohno T. Katsumata N. Kang Y.K. Nishio K. Fujiwara Y. Gene expression profiling of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters as a predictor of the pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients.Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2006; 99: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Others have shown that MTDH increases MDR1 protein levels without affecting MDR1 transcription in a mechanism that involves increased association of MDR1 mRNA with polysomes (19Yoo B.K. Chen D. Su Z.Z. Gredler R. Yoo J. Shah K. Fisher P.B. Sarkar D. Molecular mechanism of chemoresistance by astrocyte elevated gene-1.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 3249-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This study also reported that the association of MDR1 mRNA with polysomes is profoundly inhibited by PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Thus, we tested the effect of PI3K/mTOR inhibition using BEZ235 (dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) on the association of MTDH with target mRNAs. BEZ235 treatment reduced the association of some mRNAs with MTDH, increased the association of some mRNAs with MTDH, and also induced the association of novel mRNAs with MTDH (Fig. 3A and supplemental Tables 2–5). These data demonstrate that MTDH can associate with various mRNAs, and inhibition of PI3K/mTOR alters the pattern of mRNAs associated with MTDH. To determine whether MTDH association with mRNAs alters their translation, we examined how MTDH knockdown affects protein levels of select MTDH-associated mRNAs. As shown in Fig. 3B, an increase in protein levels of PDCD11 and KDM6A was observed in MTDH-depleted cells, suggesting that cytoplasmic MTDH negatively regulates translation of these mRNAs. We next performed a series of experiments to understand the functional consequences of cytoplasmic MTDH expression. First, to test whether MTDH affects the response to DNA damage, we examined distribution of the homologous repair protein Rad51 by immunostaining in Hec50 cells with control or MTDH shRNA. A significant increase in nuclear accumulation of Rad51 was observed with MTDH depletion in full serum (Fig. 4A). It should be noted that the nuclear Rad51 is much larger than the typically reported size of Rad51 foci that form in response to DNA damage. However, a similar Rad51 accumulation was observed in serum-starved Hec50 cells without MTDH knockdown (Fig. 4A). This specific Rad51 staining was not detected in mitotic cells, which are indicated in Fig. 4A by the arrow. Restoring expression of full-length MTDH or MTDH (1–471) but not MTDH (1–300) or MTDH (471–582) inhibited Rad51 nuclear accumulation (supplemental Fig. 8). We next analyzed how cytoplasmic MTDH affects cell cycle progression. When cells were cultured in full serum, flow cytometry analysis showed that 16.5% of MTDH-depleted cells were at the G2/M phase as compared with 7.4% of control shRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4B). However, after culture in 0.1% FBS, 25% of MTDH-depleted cells were in S phase and 29.5% of cells were at G2/M as compared with 61.6% of control cells at S and 18% at G2/M (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that MTDH is involved in cell cycle regulation. Expression of MTDH confers resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents (8Yoo B.K. Gredler R. Vozhilla N. Su Z.Z. Chen D.

Therefore, we explored how depletion of cytoplasmic MTDH alters sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent MMC. Decreased colony formation was observed with MTDH knockdown as compared with control shRNA-transfected cells after treatment with MMC (Fig. 4C). In addition to DNA-damaging agents, MTDH depletion also increased sensitivity to targeted agents such as the triple angiokinase inhibitor BIBF1120 (Fig. 4D). Finally, we examined how MTDH affects tumor formation and progression by injecting MTDH shRNA or control shRNA Hec50 cells into athymic mice. MTDH knockdown significantly reduced malignancy as determined by tumor volume (Fig. 4E). Collectively, our data indicate that cytoplasmic MTDH functions in cell cycle regulation, proliferation, sensitivity to anti-cancer treatments, and tumor progression in vivo. In conclusion, we define a novel function for cytoplasmic MTDH that may contribute to drug resistance and metastasis. Our study indicates that cytoplasmic MTDH associates with multiple cytoplasmic proteins and mRNAs and regulates mRNA translation. Furthermore, we reveal that MTDH interacts with mRNAs encoding proteins involved in numerous oncogenic signaling pathways and inhibits translation of these mRNAs. Our functional data reveal that cytoplasmic MTDH provides a strong survival advantage to cancer cells and identify MTDH as an emerging therapeutic target for cancers in which it is overexpressed.

However, the mechanism underlying pAkt loss is unclear. In the current study, we demonstrate pAkt loss in ventral midbrain of mice treated with dopaminergic neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), when compared to ventral midbrain of control mice treated with vehicle alone. Thiol residues of the critical cysteines in Akt are oxidized to a greater degree in mice treated with MPTP, which is reflected as a 40% loss of reduced Akt. Association of oxidatively modified Akt with the phosphatase PP2A, which can lead to enhanced dephosphorylation of pAkt, was significantly stronger after MPTP treatment. Maintaining the protein thiol homeostasis by thiol antioxidants prevented loss of reduced Akt, decreased association with PP2A, and maintained pAkt levels. Overexpression of glutaredoxin, a protein disulfide oxidoreductase, in human primary neurons helped sustain reduced state of Akt and abolished MPP+-mediated pAkt loss. We demonstrate for the first time the selective loss of Akt activity, in vivo, due to oxidative modification of Akt and provide mechanistic insight into oxidative stress-induced down-regulation of cell survival pathway in mouse midbrain following exposure to MPTP.—Durgadoss, L., Nidadavolu, P., Khader Valli, R., Saeed, U., Mishra, M., Seth, P., Ravindranath, R.

https://openalex.org/W2081677105,"IRE1α is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized signaling molecule critical for unfolded protein response. During ER stress, IRE1α activation is induced by oligomerization and autophosphorylation in its cytosolic domain, a process triggered by dissociation of an ER luminal chaperone, binding immunoglobulin-protein (BiP), from IRE1α. In addition, inhibition of a cytosolic chaperone protein Hsp90 also induces IRE1α oligomerization and activation in the absence of an ER stressor. Here, we report that the Hsp90 cochaperone Cdc37 directly interacts with IRE1α through a highly conserved cytosolic motif of IRE1α. Cdc37 knockdown or disruption of Cdc37 interaction with IRE1α significantly increased basal IRE1α activity.

The folding capacity of the ER is tightly regulated to match the flux of protein synthesis through a highly conserved ER stress signaling pathway. An increase in ER load triggers a coordinated compensatory response, including inhibition of protein synthesis, increase in ER chaperone expression, and removal of unfolded proteins via proteasome-dependent degradation. This so-called unfolded-protein-response (UPR) is critical to maintain ER homeostasis and essential for cellular survival and function (1.Patil C. Walter P.

Dynamic interaction of BiP and ER stress transducers in the unfolded protein response.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). Under basal condition, an ER luminal chaperone protein, BiP/GRP78, binds to these molecules from the ER lumen and suppresses their basal activity. During ER stress, misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen and remove BiP from IRE1, PERK, and ATF-6, leading to their activation and downstream signaling. For IRE1, removal of BiP binding uncovers an IRE1 dimerization domain located in the N-terminal domain within the ER lumen that initiates IRE1 oligomerization. Oligomerized IRE1 triggers trans-autophosphorylation in its cytosolic domain (9.Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. The unfolded protein response pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

In addition to the dimerization domain within the ER lumen, recent biochemical and structural analysis has also revealed that IRE1 possesses an oligomerization motif in the cytosolic kinase domain that mediates IRE1 interaction and endonuclease activation (14.Marcu M.G. Doyle M. Bertolotti A. Ron D. Hendershot L. Neckers L. Heat shock protein 90 modulates the unfolded protein response by stabilizing IRE1α.Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8506-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism that regulates the cytosolic domain-mediated oligomerization and autophosphorylation activity of IRE1α remains to be established. Hsp90 is an abundant cytosolic protein that functions with cochaperone Cdc37 to selectively interact with client kinases and regulate their stability and activity. Inhibition of Hsp90 induces ER stress associated with increased expression BiP (15.Lai M.T. Huang K.L. Chang W.M. Lai Y.K.

Sreedhar A.S. Rao C.M. Hsp90 inhibitors, GA and 17AAG, lead to ER stress-induced apoptosis in rat histiocytoma.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 78: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have implied that heat shock protein Hsp90 regulates IRE1 protein stability and UPR through a cytosolic domain (14.Marcu M.G. Doyle M. Bertolotti A. Ron D. Hendershot L. Neckers L. Heat shock protein 90 modulates the unfolded protein response by stabilizing IRE1α.Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8506-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, the detailed molecular mechanism remains unexplored. In this report, we find that Hsp90 and Cdc37 are molecular components of the IRE1α signaling complex. Cdc37 interacts with IRE1α directly via a cytosolic motif located in the kinase/oligomerization domain of IRE1α. Cdc37 expression is both necessary and sufficient for IRE1α inactivation under basal conditions. Disrupting the Cdc37 interaction with IRE1α impairs the normal UPR during ER stress. In INS-1 cells, Hsp90 inhibition or interrupting Cdc37 interaction with IRE1 results in a significant impairment of glucose-induced insulin synthesis and secretion. Therefore, our study has revealed Cdc37 as a new molecular component of the IRE1 signaling complex. Cdc37-Hsp90 activity is necessary to maintain basal IRE1α inactivation through direct interaction in the cytosol. This mechanism also plays a role in the normal ER stress response and protein homeostasis important for glucose induced insulin synthesis/secretion in pancreatic β cells. INS-1 was grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 units/ml penicillin:streptomycin solution. HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin:streptomycin solution. Cells were treated with 1 μg/ml of geldanamycin (GA) for the indicated time. HeLa cells were infected with an adenovirus expressing IRE1α (Adv-IRE1α) and were incubated for an additional 24 h before the experiment. Cotransfection of HeLa cells with Adv-IRE1α and Adv-shRNA was also performed 24 h prior to the experiment. Proteins were homogenized in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2.5 mm Na4P2O7, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Proteins were separated on 12% Bis/Tris PAGE (Invitrogen) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins were detected by immunoblots using antibodies against IRE1α, XBP-1, Actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), IRE1α (Ser-724) (Novus Biologicals), BiP, IRE1α, Cdc37 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), Cdc37, Hsp90α/β, insulin (Abcam), penta-His (Qiagen), Myc, p-Akt, and Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). Phospho-IRE1α was detected by first immunoprecipitating IRE1α from the total protein extract using anti-IRE1α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) with protein A-conjugated agarose beads (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4 °C. Precipitant was boiled in loading buffer containing 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol and separated on 4–12% Bis/Tris SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) following the company's protocol. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer, and 2 mg of total cellular protein lysates were loaded on a column of sucrose gradient ranging from 10–50% or 10–40% and centrifuged for 16 h at 132,000 × g at 4 °C. INS-1 cells were cultured as described earlier, and fresh media were added a day before the assay. Cells were starved in KRBH buffer (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.01% DMSO, 1 μg/ml GA, or 1 μg/ml tunicamycin (TM). Cells were then treated with KRBH + 16.7 mm glucose for 1 h at 37 °C. Media from each sample was snap-frozen and kept at −80 °C for an insulin secretion assay by ELISA (Crystal Chem, Inc.). Total protein lysates were prepared in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the company's protocol. RNA was isolated from each sample using TRIzol, and cDNA was synthesized using SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the company's protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR was done using iQ SYBR Green Supermix and MyiQ (Bio-Rad). All the reactions and analyses were done using iCycler (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences, melt curve, and efficiency of each PCR are shown in supplemental Fig. S6, A–C, respectively. Hsp90 inhibition by GA is known to regulate IRE1 protein stability (14.Marcu M.G. Doyle M. Bertolotti A. Ron D. Hendershot L. Neckers L. Heat shock protein 90 modulates the unfolded protein response by stabilizing IRE1α.Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8506-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and participates in the unfolded protein response regulation (14.Marcu M.G. Doyle M. Bertolotti A. Ron D. Hendershot L. Neckers L. Heat shock protein 90 modulates the unfolded protein response by stabilizing IRE1α.Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8506-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 17.Davenport E.L. Moore H.E. Dunlop A.S. Sharp S.Y. Workman P. Morgan G.J. Davies F.E. Heat shock protein inhibition is associated with activation of the unfolded protein response pathway in myeloma plasma cells.Blood. 2007; 110: 2641-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of GA on IRE1, INS-1 (a rat pancreatic β cell line) was treated with GA, and its effect was compared with other ER stress inducers, including DTT, TM, and thapsigargin (TG). DTT is a strong reducing agent that quickly induces ER stress to activate UPR pathways, whereas TM and TG are slow-acting inducers by inhibiting protein glycosylation or sarcoplasmic/ER calcium ATPase (SERCA), respectively. We observed that GA treatment for 30 min resulted in a robust induction of IRE1α phosphorylation. In contrast, cells treated with TM failed to induce IRE1α phosphorylation during the same time frame (Fig. 1A). When the effect of GA was compared with DTT, both equally induced IRE1α phosphorylation, whereas the PERK pathway indicated by p-PERK and its downstream substrate p-eIF2α or ATF6 was not activated by GA to the same extent as DTT (Fig. 1B). Therefore, acute GA treatment specifically induced IRE1α phosphorylation without inducing the general ER stress pathway. Similar results were seen in INS-1 cells treated with another Hsp90 inhibitor, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (supplemental Fig. S1). ER stressors such as TM and TG lead to sustained IRE1 activation, as indicated by increased levels of Xbp-1 pro-RNA splicing for up to 4 h post-treatment (Fig. 1C). In contrast, Hsp90 inhibition resulted in only a transient induction of IRE1 activity. After 120 min post-GA-treatment, total IRE1, phospho-IRE1α, and Xbp-1 pro-RNA splicing were all decreased (Fig. 1, B and C). This is in an agreement with a previous report that long-term Hsp90 inhibition causes IRE1 protein degradation (14.Marcu M.G. Doyle M. Bertolotti A. Ron D. Hendershot L. Neckers L. Heat shock protein 90 modulates the unfolded protein response by stabilizing IRE1α.Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8506-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, however, the IRE1 induction was maintained up to 120 min when the culture media was replaced every 30 min with fresh media containing 1 μg/ml GA. In contrast, total IRE1 protein was reduced after 90 min of GA treatment compared with the earlier time points by the same treatment (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that Hsp90 regulates IRE1 through two different mechanisms: one regulates IRE1 protein stability, and another regulates IRE1 activity through a so far uncharacterized mechanism independent of general ER stress induction. To identify the IRE1α binding proteins, we employed LC-MS/MS analysis of the IRE1α immunocomplex isolated from INS-1 cells expressing FLAG-tagged IRE1α protein and identified Hsp90 and its cochaperone Cdc37 as part of the protein complex. Using coimmunoprecipitation assay in HeLa cells expressing cMyc-tagged IRE1α (WT) or IRE1α kinase dead mutant (KD), we found that both wild-type IRE1α and the KD mutant bind to the endogenous Hsp90 and Cdc37 chaperone complex (Fig. 2A). However, when INS-1 cells were treated with TM or GA for 10 or 60 min, the amount of Cdc37 interacting with the IRE1α was decreased with no marked change in the interaction between IRE1α and Hsp90. Therefore, Cdc37 appears to be released from the IRE1α complex upon ER stress induction or Hsp90 inhibition (Fig. 2, B and C). This observation suggests that IRE1 interaction with Hsp90 is not sensitive to Hsp90 inhibition. However, Cdc37 interaction with IRE1 is Hsp90 activity-dependent. To further investigate the interaction between endogenous IRE1α and Hsp90-Cdc37 chaperones, INS-1 cells were treated with DMSO or GA for 15 min, and the total lysates were fractionated on a sucrose gradient. Increase in phospho-IRE1α is detected in GA-treated samples as expected (Fig. 3A). Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B) or immunoblotting on β-actin (C) from the fractionated samples demonstrated no apparent differences in the overall protein distribution profile between DMSO- and GA-treated samples. In protein extracts prepared from DMSO-treated INS-1 cells, IRE1α displayed a broad spectrum of distribution from fraction 8 to 16, indicating different forms of IRE1 complexes in intact cells. Both Hsp90 and Cdc37 comigrated with IRE1α in lower molecular weight fractions (8 to 12). Upon GA treatment, IRE1α signals were shifted to higher molecular weight fractions, consistent with IRE1α oligomerization (Fig. 3, C and D). Similarly, distribution of Hsp90 was also observed to shift to higher molecular weight fractions. This is consistent with the notion that Hsp90 remained associated with IRE1 upon Hsp90 inhibition (as shown in Fig. 2), as well as previously reported by Marcu et al. (14.Marcu M.G. Doyle M. Bertolotti A. Ron D. Hendershot L. Neckers L. Heat shock protein 90 modulates the unfolded protein response by stabilizing IRE1α.Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8506-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In contrast, Cdc37 showed no change in sucrose gradient distribution after GA treatment. These data again support the earlier observation that Cdc37 interacts with IRE1 in an Hsp90 activity-dependent manner. To investigate the functional significance of Cdc37-Hsp90 interaction with IRE1, shRNA was used to down-regulate endogenous Cdc37 expression in HeLa cells where the Hsp90 inhibition-induced IRE1 activation was also observed (supplemental Fig. S2). As shown in Fig. 4, A–C, IRE1α activities, as indicated by phospho-IRE1α, IRE1α dimerization, and Xbp-1 pro-RNA splicing at both protein and RNA levels, were all significantly increased in Cdc37 knockdown cells compared with controls (shLuci), whereas there was no change in ATF6 or PERK (indicated by p-eIF2α) activities (Fig. 4D). Moreover, GA-induced IRE1 activation was further enhanced in Cdc37 knockdown cells (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that Cdc37 is a negative regulator of IRE1α. The specificity of IRE1α-mediated XBP1 splicing was demonstrated in Fig. 5C, where the IRE1α kinase dead mutant (KD) failed to trigger XBP1 splicing under any treatment. Chronic inactivation of Cdc37 did not result in a loss of total IRE1α protein expression or a change in its sucrose gradient distribution profile (supplemental Fig. S3), implying that Cdc37 is not involved in Hsp90-mediated regulation of IRE1α protein stability or oligomerization. Overexpression of Cdc37 in INS-1 resulted in a modest but significant reduction of phospho-IRE1α at the basal level (supplemental Fig. S4). When the cells were treated with DTT or GA, there was a trend toward a decrease in IRE1α activation, but it did not reach statistical significance. Thus, although necessary, base-line expression of Cdc37 does not appear to be sufficient to modulate IRE1 activation. This may be explained by the notion that Hsp90/Cdc37 are very abundant proteins relative to other ER regulatory components (18.Csermely P. Schnaider T. Soti C. Prohászka Z. Nardai G.

The full-length IRE1α containing the N terminus transmembrane domain could not be purified because of its insolubility. However, a specific interaction was detected between Cdc37 and the IRE1α aa 551–832 fragment containing the kinase domain (Fig. 6, B and C). When expressed in INS-1 cells, this IRE1α fragment did not reduce the endogenous IRE1α interaction with Cdc37 under basal conditions but reduced Cdc37 binding after 15 min of DTT or GA treatment (Fig. 6D). The aa 551–832 region was further divided into smaller fragments containing different functional motifs, including aa 551–650 for the ATP binding pocket, aa 651–750 for both the catalytic loop and activation loop, and aa 701–750 for the activation loop. As shown in Fig. 7A, the Cdc37 interaction was only detected with the fragment aa 651–750, which we postulate to contain a Cdc37 binding domain (CBD) (supplemental Fig. S5). This interaction was further validated using a coimmunoprecipitation assay in INS-1 cells expressing Myc-IRE1α-CBD (Fig. 7B). Consistent with the observation made in the Cdc37 knockdown cells, the expression of IRE1α-CBD fragment increased the basal phosphorylation level of the endogenous IRE1α (Fig. 7C). However, overexpression of IRE1α-CBD attenuated GA-induced IRE1α autophosphorylation, indicating Cdc37-interaction with IRE1α can also impact on the full activity. Earlier structural studies have revealed that the IRE1α aa 551–650 fragment contains several conserved residues that are directly involved in an IRE1 kinase domain dimer interface interaction critical for the IRE1 autophosphorylation (Fig. 7D, Ref. 12.Lee K.P.

Therefore, our data suggest that Cdc37 interacts with IRE1α via its highly conserved kinase domain in the cytosol. This interaction may modulate IRE1 autophosphorylation by regulating the kinase domain dimer interface interaction.FIGURE 7Cdc37 interacts with the IRE1 dimer interface region and regulates IRE1 activity.

To determine the effect of Hsp90 inhibition on insulin expression and secretion, INS-1 cells were starved for 2 h and treated with or without 16.7 mm glucose for 1 h in the presence of 0.01% DMSO or 1 μg/ml GA. As shown in Fig. 8A, GA treatment induced a robust increase in Xbp-1 pro-RNA splicing, whereas there was no detectable difference in IRE1α phosphorylation levels at the same time point. The intracellular insulin level was significantly reduced in GA-treated cells compared with the DMSO-treated control (Fig. 8B). A similar effect was also observed in TM-treated cells. Glucose-induced insulin secretion was measured by ELISA from conditioned culture media and found to be reduced in GA-treated cells compared with DMSO controls (Fig. 8C). In contrast, there were no differences in the insulin mRNA levels between DMSO- and GA-treated cells at both basal conditions and in response to glucose stimulation (Fig. 8D). The quality of RT-PCR according to MIQE guidelines is shown in supplemental Fig. S6. Therefore, Hsp90 inhibition is sufficient to decrease insulin production and secretion similar to what is observed under ER stress induction (21.Lipson K.L. Fonseca S.G. Ishigaki S. Nguyen L.X.

To further demonstrate the role of Cdc37-mediated IRE1α regulation in this process, the IRE1α-CBD was expressed in INS-1 cells followed by glucose stimulation as described earlier (Fig. 9A). Western blot analyses showed a significant decrease in the insulin protein level at both basal conditions and following glucose stimulation in the IRE1α-CBD expressing INS-1 cells compared with controls. In addition, RT-PCR also showed a significant decrease in insulin mRNA expression at the basal level when IRE1α-CBD was overexpressed (Fig. 9B). Therefore, disrupting the Cdc37-Hsp90-IRE1α complex by either Hsp90 inhibition or IRE1α-CBD peptide leads to impaired insulin synthesis and secretion. All these data suggest that Cdc37-Hsp90-mediated IRE1α regulation is important for protein homeostasis (Fig. 9C).FIGURE 9Cdc37-IRE1 interaction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. A, immunoblot analyses for Myc, insulin protein, p-IRE1α, total IRE1α, and BiP in cell extracts prepared from INS-1 cells expressing either vector or Myc-IRE1α-CBD (651–750) at basal levels or after 1-h treatment with 16.7 mm glucose.

Doyle M. Bertolotti A. Ron D. Hendershot L. Neckers L. Heat shock protein 90 modulates the unfolded protein response by stabilizing IRE1α.Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8506-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), but the molecular basis and the functional significance of Hsp90-mediated regulation of IRE1 have not yet been established. In this report, we demonstrate that Cdc37, a kinase specific cochaperone of Hsp90, interacts directly with the kinase domain of IRE1α in an Hsp90 activity-dependent manner. This interaction may block IRE1α kinase autophosphorylation by interfering with the IRE1 dimerization via its kinase domain dimer interface and has a critical role in suppressing IRE1α activity under basal condition as well as its induction under ER stress. Disrupting this interaction by either Hsp90 inhibition, Cdc37 knockdown, or overexpression of the IRE1α-CBD peptide led to elevated basal activity of IRE1α. At the functional level, Hsp90 inhibition or IRE1α-CBD expression attenuated glucose-stimulated insulin production and secretion. Therefore, Cdc37 interaction with IRE1α and Cdc37-Hsp90-mediated regulation of IRE1α activity are critical to normal ER stress response and the dynamic regulation of protein homeostasis in cells. It has been reported previously that IRE1α is a client protein of Hsp90 because of its ability to regulate IRE1α protein stability (14.Marcu M.G. Doyle M. Bertolotti A. Ron D. Hendershot L. Neckers L. Heat shock protein 90 modulates the unfolded protein response by stabilizing IRE1α.Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8506-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that Hsp90 inhibition induces IRE1α autophosphorylation and oligomerization, which is also associated with the exit of Cdc37 from the IRE1α complex. Cdc37 knockdown resulted in an increase in IRE1α phosphorylation and oligomerization and an induction of XBP-1s. However, Cdc37 knockdown or disruption of Cdc37-IRE1α interaction had no effect on IRE1α protein stability. These data lead us to conclude that Hsp90 regulates IRE1α oligomerization and autophosphorylation in a Cdc37-dependent manner, whereas IRE1α protein stability is regulated independently of Cdc37, perhaps involving other yet to be characterized cochaperones. On the basis of our binding assays, Cdc37 directly interacts with the IRE1α kinase domain, which overlaps with dimer interface residues as defined by a previous structural analysis. Overexpression of the Cdc37 binding domain increased the basal IRE1α phosphorylation, whereas attenuated Hsp90 inhibition or ER stress induced IRE1α induction. Therefore, our study revealed a so far uncharacterized Cdc37-dependent cytosolic regulatory motif for IRE1α oligomerization and autophosphorylation. We can postulate that the dissociation of BiP from the ER luminal domain of IRE1α and dissociation of Cdc37 from the kinase domain in the cytosolic compartment represent a coordinated two-prompt regulatory process for IREα activation during the ER stress response. The exact molecular mechanism involved in the dynamic regulation of Cdc37-IRE1α interaction is unknown but may involve Cdc37-Hsp90-mediated conformational changes of IRE1α. It is known that conformation of the IRE1 cytosolic domain determines the amplitude as well as the specificity of its RNase activity. The specific contribution of Cdc37-Hsp90 chaperone complex activity toward IRE1 conformational change needs to be further established. Although others have observed the induction of both the ATF6 and PERK pathways in response to Hsp90 inhibition, we only observed a slight increase in PERK activity, as indicated by the eIF2α phosphorylation level. This is consistent with a previous observation showing a very weak activation of PERK in response to GA (14.Marcu M.G. Doyle M. Bertolotti A. Ron D. Hendershot L. Neckers L. Heat shock protein 90 modulates the unfolded protein response by stabilizing IRE1α.Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8506-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In our study, Cdc37 knockdown has a specific effect on IRE1α activity. Moreover, despite the increase in XBP-1s, we did not observe any increase in BiP expression after GA treatment or Cdc37 knockdown. Therefore, Cdc37 has a highly selective impact on IRE1α activity. All three UPR sensor proteins, PERK, ATF6, and IRE1, are under tight regulation. Although these proteins all interact with BiP in the luminal domain, the kinetics and the duration of the activation for each pathway are different (23.Lin J.H. Li H. Yasumura D. Cohen H.R. Zhang C.

There is also cross-talk and cooperation among different pathways to enable concerted UPR (2.Ma Y. Hendershot L.M.

Some of the mechanisms implicated in the IRE1 inactivation include deactivation by phosphatase, such as Dcr2 in S. cerevisiae (29.Guo J. Polymenis M. Dcr2 targets Ire1 and down-regulates the unfolded protein response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), or by cleaving its own mRNA(30.Tirasophon W.

The endoribonuclease activity of mammalian IRE1 autoregulates its mRNA and is required for the unfolded protein response.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Lin et al. (23.Lin J.H. Li H. Yasumura D. Cohen H.R. Zhang C. Panning B. Shokat K.M. Lavail M.M. Walter P. IRE1 signaling affects cell fate during the unfolded protein response.Science. 2007; 318: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar) found that prolongation of IRE1 activity under constant ER stress also enhanced cell survival. Thus, sustained or early termination of IRE1 activity can lead to cell apoptosis, highlighting the importance of tight regulation of IRE1 activity in ER stress signaling. Our report has identified yet another step in the IRE1α regulatory scheme involving the cytosolic interaction with Cdc37. Its specific impact on IRE1α versus other ER stress pathways, such as PERK and ATF6, may contribute to the differential activation profiles among the different ER stress signaling pathways and helps to determine the functional outcome of an UPR. Pancreatic β-cells secrete insulin in response to hyperglycemia along with an induction in insulin gene expression (31.Fonseca V. Davidson J. Home P. Snyder J. Jellinger P. Dyhr Toft A. Barnett A.

IRE1α is shown to be activated, and its activity is important to mediate compensatory UPR during insulin induction (21.Lipson K.L. Fonseca S.G. Ishigaki S. Nguyen L.X. Foss E. Bortell R. Rossini A.A.

IRE1α knockdown resulted in a decrease in insulin expression at the basal level, whereas prolonged activation of IRE1α also leads to impaired insulin biosynthesis (21.Lipson K.L. Fonseca S.G.

We show here that Hsp90 inhibition and specific disruption of the Cdc37-IRE1α interaction all lead to defects in insulin secretion and expression. Therefore, a coordinated regulation of IRE1α from the ER lumen and cytosol is critical to maintain normal ER function. However, our current study is limited to in vitro analysis using INS-1 cells, and the physiological significance of this mechanism in glucose regulation or other ER stress related function in intact animals remains to be elucidated.

At present, post mortem sampling is the only way to identify them. Therefore, such cell typing is inadequate for preserving neural progenitor cells for any meaningful stem cell therapy. We aimed to target cerebral pericytes in vivo using dual gene transcript-targeted MRI (GT-tMRI) in male C57black6 mice after a 60-min bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO). We attached superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to phosphorothioate-modified micro-DNA that targets actin or nestin mRNA. Because BCAO compromises the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and induces expression of α-smooth muscle (αSM)-actin and nestin antigens by pericytes in new vessels, we delivered pericyte-specific magnetic resonance contrast agents (SPION-actin or SPION-nestin at 4 mg Fe/kg) by i.p. injection to C57black6 mice that had experienced BCAO. We demonstrated that the surge in cerebral iron content by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry matched the increase in the frequency of relaxivity. We also found that SPION-nestin was colocalized in αSM-actin- and nestin-expressing pericytes in BCAO-treated C57black6 or transgenic mice [B6.Cg-Tg(CAG-mRFP1) 1F1Hadj/J, expressing red fluorescent protein by actin promoter]. We identified pericytes in the repair patch in living brains after BCAO with a voxel size of 0.03 mm3 . The presence of electron-dense nanoparticles in vascular pericytes in the region of BBB injury led us to draw the conclusion that GT-tMRI can noninvasively reveal neural progenitor cells during vascularization.—Liu, C.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are dual-specificity serine/threonine kinases that drive intracellular signal transduction (1.Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mitogen-activated protein kinases. Specific messages from ubiquitous messengers.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). MAPK family kinases share sequence similarity and conserved structural domains and include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and p38 MAPK. ERK is activated by mitogens and growth factors (2.Roux P.P. Blenis J. ERK and p38 MAPK-activated protein kinases. A family of protein kinases with diverse biological functions.Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Protein arginine methyl transferases (PRMTs) are evolutionarily conserved enzymes that catalyze transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosyl methionine to the guanidino nitrogen of protein-bound arginine. Eight functional PRMT proteins are encoded in the mammalian genome (17.Pahlich S. Zakaryan R.P. Gehring H. Protein arginine methylation. Cellular functions and methods of analysis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1890-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These enzymes mono- and dimethylate arginine residues in proteins and are classified as type I (PRMT1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8) and type II (PRMT5 and 7) enzymes. Type I enzymes catalyze formation of asymmetrically dimethylated arginine (16.Bedford M.T. Clarke S.G. Protein arginine methylation in mammals. Who, what, and why.Mol.

An important study shows that PRMT1 modulates p38 MAPK regulation of differentiation in megakaryocytes (36.Chang Y.I. Hua W.K. Yao C.L. Hwang S.M. Hung Y.C. Kuan C.J. Leou J.S. Lin W.J.

In addition to these functions in signal transduction, PRMT5 also participates in the assembly of the transcriptional repressor complex on various eukaryotic promoters (37.Cesaro E. De Cegli R.

Involucrin is a keratinocyte structural protein that functions as a precursor of the cornified envelope and is expressed in the suprabasal layers of epidermis (38.Rice R.H. Green H.

Regulation of involucrin gene expression has been extensively studied as a model for understanding regulation of differentiation-dependent gene expression in epidermis (5.Eckert R.L. Crish J.F.

A PKC, Ras, MEKK1, MEK3/MEK6 signaling cascade has been implicated as a key control pathway in regulating involucrin expression (5.Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Efimova T. Dashti S.R. Deucher A. Bone F.

In this study we use this system to study cross-talk between PRMT5 and MAPK signaling in regulating keratinocyte differentiation. We show that PRMT5 reduces involucrin expression in normal human keratinocytes (KERn). These studies further show that PRMT5 is part of a p38δ-ERK signaling complex and that PRMT5 modification of proteins in this complex is associated with reduced p38δ phosphorylation. The net impact is that PRMT5 antagonizes p38δ-dependent keratinocyte differentiation. Keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM), trypsin and Hanks' balanced salt solution were purchased from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for ERK1/2 (sc-94), protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ, sc-213), PKCα (sc-208), p38δ (sc-7587), p38α (sc-7572), p38β (sc-6176), PRMT5 (sc-22132), PRMT1 (sc-59648), and peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (sc-2033) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-β-actin (A5441), anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (F-3165), anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (A2220), and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were obtained from Sigma. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (NXA931) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V) were purchased from GE Healthcare. The antibody for detection of symmetric dimethyl arginine (07-412) was from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Knockdown of PKCδ and PRMT5 was achieved using siRNA. Pooled PKCδ-siRNA was from Santa Cruz (sc-36253) and from Dharmacon (J-003524-08). We also used individual siRNAs that target PKCδ mRNA sequences 5′-AGAAGAAGCCGACCAUGUAU (PKCδ-1) and 5′-GUUGAUGUCUGUUCAGUAUUU (PKCδ-2) (40.Cai Q. Li J. Gao T. Xie J. Evers B.M.

Rabbit anti-phospho-p38 (9211S) was from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA), and mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (M8159) was from Sigma.

Adenoviruses encoding wild-type FLAG-p38δ, PKCδ, and empty control adenovirus (Ad5-FLAG-p38δ, Ad5-PKCδ, Ad5-EV) were prepared as previously described by propagation in 293 cells and purification by cesium chloride centrifugation (9.Dashti S.R.

For infection, keratinocytes were treated with multiplicity of infection 10 of adenovirus in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml Polybrene for 4 h before the addition of fresh KSFM. Keratinocytes were infected with Ad5-FLAG-p38δ and after 24 h extracts were prepared in lysate buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and proteinase inhibitor mixture). Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel was washed with a large volume of lysis buffer followed by two bed volumes of 20 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.8, and then re-equilibrated with lysis buffer. Cell lysate (120 mg of total protein) was incubated with M2 gel for 12 h at 4 °C with shaking and then packed in to PD10 column and washed with lysis buffer until A280 < 0.02 to remove unbound protein. FLAG-p38δ-associated proteins were eluted with 20 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.8, and the collected fractions (200 μl) were neutralized by the addition of 1 m Tris before storage at −20 C. Affinity-purified FLAG-p38δ-associated proteins, prepared as outlined above, were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Gel bands were excised and digested with trypsin, and the tryptic peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy using a Bruker Omniflex benchtop MALDI-TOF MS/MS. For protein identification, the monoisotopic mass maps of tryptic peptides were searched in databases using the MASCOT search engine. Total extracts in lysis buffer were incubated with appropriate primary antibody and protein A/G-agarose overnight at 4 ºC and washed 4 times with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. After the final wash the beads were collected, boiled with sample buffer, and centrifuged, and supernatant was electrophoresed and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and antibody binding was visualized by chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Biosciences). Keratinocytes were electroporated with plasmids using an Amaxa electroporator and the VPD-1002 nucleofection kit (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany). Keratinocytes were harvested with trypsin and replated 1 day before use. On the day of electroporation, 1.2 million replated cells were harvested with trypsin and resuspended in KSFM. The cells were collected at 2000 × g, washed with 1 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in 100 μl of keratinocyte nucleofection solution. The cell suspension, which included 3 μg of plasmid or siRNA, was mixed by gentle up and down pipetting and electroporated using the T-018 program. KSFM (500 μl) was added, and the suspension was transferred to a 60-mm cell culture dish. The pOTB7-hPRMT5 (GenBankTM BC025979) plasmid (MHS1011-7508890) was obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). hPRMT5 was amplified to create a BamHI/NotI fragment using forward (5′-GATCGAATTCGGATCCATGGAACAAAAACTTATTTCTGAAGAAGATCTGATGGCGGCGATGGCGGTCGGG3) and reverse (5′-GATCTCTAGAGCGGCCGCCTAGAGGCCAATGGTATATGAGCGGCCTGT3)primers. The ATG start codon (double underline) and myc epitope (underlined) are indicated. The insert was then cloned into pcDNA3 to create pcDNA3-myc-hPRMT5. RNA was isolated using RNAspin Mini kit (25-0500-71) (GE Healthcare). RNA (1 μg) was used for cDNA synthesis with Moloney murine leukemia virus transcriptase (Invitrogen). Gene expression was measured by real time PCR using Light Cycler 480 SYBR Green I Master mix (04-707 516 001) from Roche Diagnostics and specific primers for hPRMT5 (forward, 5′-TGAGGCCCAGTTTGAGATGCCTTA; reverse, 5′-AGTAGCCGGCAAAGCCATGTAGTA3), involucrin (forward, 5′-CCTCAGCCTTACTGTGAG; reverse, 5′-GGGAGGCAGTGGAGTTGG), PKCδ (forward, 5′-GGCCACATCAAGATTGCCGACTTT; reverse, 5′-ACTGGCCAATGAGCATCTCGTACA), and GAPDH (forward, 5′-TCCACTGGCGTCTTCACC; reverse, 5′-GGCAGAGATGATGACCCTTT). Our previous studies describe a p38δ-ERK signaling complex in keratinocytes that regulates keratinocyte differentiation (6.Efimova T. Broome A.M. Eckert R.L.

Although these studies show that p38δ interacts with ERK1/2, it is likely that p38δ also interacts with other proteins and that these proteins influence function. To identify additional interaction partners, extracts were prepared from FLAG-p38δ-expressing keratinocytes, and p38δ-associated proteins were purified by FLAG affinity column chromatography. The column was loaded with 120 mg of total cell lysate and washed with loading buffer, and affinity-bound proteins were eluted with glycine buffer.

The signal transduction events that orchestrate the numerous cellular activities required for angiogenesis remain incompletely understood. We have shown previously that STAT5 plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis induced by FGF2 and FGF8b. To delineate the signaling pathway downstream of STAT5, we expressed constitutively active (CA) or dominant-negative (DN) mutant STAT5A in mouse brain endothelial cells (EC). We found that the conditioned medium from CA-STAT5A but not from dominant-negative STAT5A overexpressing EC is sufficient to induce EC invasion and tube formation, indicating that STAT5A regulates the secretion of autocrine proangiogenic factors. Conversely, CA-STAT5A-induced conditioned medium had no effect on EC proliferation. Using a comparative genome-wide transcription array screen, we identified the prolactin family member proliferin (PLF1 and PLF4) as a candidate autocrine factor. The CA-STAT5A-dependent transcription and secretion of PLF by EC was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. CA-STAT5A binds to the PLF1 promoter region, suggesting a direct transcriptional regulation. Knockdown of PLF expression by shRNA or by blocking of PLF activity with neutralizing antibodies removed the CA-STAT5A-dependent proangiogenic activity from the conditioned medium of EC. Similarly, the ability of concentrated conditioned medium from CA-STAT5A transfected EC to induce angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs in vivo was abolished when PLF was depleted from the medium. These observations demonstrate a FGF/STAT5/PLF signaling cascade in EC and implicate PLF as autocrine regulator of EC invasion and tube formation.

We have recently reported that STAT5 and to a lesser degree STAT1 but not STAT3 are activated by FGF2 and FGF8b in mouse brain EC (4.Yang X. Qiao D. Meyer K. Friedl A. Signal transducers and activators of transcription mediate fibroblast growth factor-induced vascular endothelial morphogenesis.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1668-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In these cells, active STAT5 induces migration, invasion, and tube formation in collagen gels but not proliferation. This apparent separation of proangiogenic signaling pathways prompted us to examine endothelial effector molecules downstream of STAT5. We report here that STAT5-induced mouse endothelial cell migration, invasion, and tube formation requires the secretion of an autocrine factor and identify this factor as the prolactin family member proliferin (PLF). We show that STAT5 binds to the regulatory region of the PLF1 gene and thus directly participates in the regulation of its expression. We further demonstrate that secreted PLF is required for STAT5-mediated angiogenesis in the Matrigel plug assay in vivo. Thus, we describe a novel role for STAT5 in a FGF-STAT5-PLF signaling cascade that facilitates FGF-induced migration, invasion, and tube formation of brain EC. Conditionally immortal mouse microvascular ECs from brain (BMVEC), bone, and prostate isolated from H-2Kb-tsA58 mice (gift from Isaiah J. Fidler) (7.Langley R.R. Ramirez K.M. Tsan R.Z. Van Arsdall M.

The cells were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h to abolish the SV40 large T antigen before the experiments. Stock solutions (10.0 mm) of recombinant human FGF2 (Pepro Tech) and recombinant mouse FGF8b (gift from Alan C. Rapraeger, University of Wisconsin) were diluted in DMEM containing 0.2% BSA to their final concentration and added to cultures for different time periods with occasional mixing. All of the monoclonal antibodies and antisera were obtained from commercial sources. Antibodies to STAT5 (C-17) and to proliferin (N-14) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Biotinylated anti-mouse PLF (BAF1623) was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Streptavidin-HRP was obtained from GE Healthcare. An antibody to phospho-STAT5A/B (8-5-2) was obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Antibodies against FLAG (F-3165) and β-actin (AC-74) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Collagen type I and collagen invasion chambers were purchased from BD Biosciences (Sparks, MD). An adenoviral expression system containing a constitutively active STAT5A mutant (CA-STAT5A) harboring a COOH terminus FLAG tag (pRKmSTAT5AHSFLAG; generated from pRKmSTAT5AcFLAG using site-directed mutagenesis by substituting His-299 and Ser-711 with arginine and phenylalanine, respectively) and a dominant-negative STAT5A mutant (DN-STAT5A) truncated from amino acids 713 to 793 (pRKmSTAT5A713FLAG) was generated in our laboratory and described previously (4.Yang X. Qiao D. Meyer K. Friedl A. Signal transducers and activators of transcription mediate fibroblast growth factor-induced vascular endothelial morphogenesis.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1668-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For adenovirus infection of target cells, BMVEC (5 × 105 cells/well) were seeded into 10-cm Petri dishes 1 day prior to infection. A fixed volume of a viral stock (50 pfu/cell) was used to infect the target cells for 24 h. The infected BMVEC were then starved in serum-free DMEM for 24 h for the subsequent experiments. Conditioned medium was collected for the subsequent experiments as needed. PLF expression in BMVEC was silenced with shRNA-containing lentiviral particles commercially obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Control shRNA (sc-10808) and shRNA targeting PLF (sc-61412-v) consist of a pool of three to five expression constructs each encoding target-specific 19–25-nucleotide (plus hairpin) shRNA designed to knockdown gene expression. The constructs were introduced into the BMVEC by lentiviral transduction, supplementing the medium with 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). After selection with Puromycin (8 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for about 2 weeks, the cells were pooled and expanded. Total RNA from treated BMVEC was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed in a reaction volume of 20 μl, containing 2 μl of 10× reverse transcription buffer, 4 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP, 1 μl of 50 μm random primer, 1 μl of 40 units RNaseOUT (Invitrogen). Synthesis of cDNA was carried out for 50 min at 50 °C. PCR amplifications were carried out in a 25-μl reaction volume at a 60 °C annealing temperature. The primer sequences used for the ChIP assays were as follows: F1, CCAACTCCAGTGAAGCA; R1, TCAGTACCTAAGCCGTGTGG; F2, TGAGACTGCTGGTCCTCCTA; R2, TGCTGACAACTGTGGTTGAA; F3, TTGTGAGCCCTGTTTGAGAG; and R3, AGTCTCCTTCACTGCCCATT. The primer sequences used to measure PLF1 gene expression were: F1, TTCAACCATGCTCCTGGATA; and R1, GACCATTCCTCATTGCACAC. The primer sequences used to measure PLF4 gene expression were: F1, CCCTCATGAGCACCATGAA; and R1, TGATCATGCCATATGAAGAAC. For measuring cell proliferation, 1.5 × 105 BMVEC were seeded into DMEM supplemented with 0.5% or 5.0% FBS in a 24-well plate and cultured at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After a 96-h incubation, the cells were washed with ice-cold saline, trypsinized, stained with Trypan Blue, and counted. For the chromogenic proliferation assay, 3000 cells in a 100-μl volume were seeded into 96-well plates and at the end of treatments, 50 μl of CellTiter 96Aqueous One Solution Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) were added. The cultures were incubated for 1–4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and absorbance at 490 nm was recorded using a 96-well plate reader (SpectraMax; Molecular Devices). The cells were collected and washed three times with cold PBS and lysed with 150 μl of RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors on ice for 20 min. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured by BCA assay, and the lysates were mixed with 5× sample buffer. After boiling for 5 min, 50 μg of total protein from each sample were separated on a 7.5–12% SDS-PAGE gel. After transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies against the proteins of interest in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk plus 0.5% Tween 20, overnight at 4 °C. After washing and incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the proteins were revealed using an enhanced chemiluminescent detection kit (Thermo-Scientific, Rockford, IL). The volume of conditioned medium samples was adjusted up 1 ml and precipitated with 100 μl of 100% TCA (28.57 g of TCA in 20 ml of Milli Q water). The tubes were placed on ice for at least 2 h. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the precipitates were washed twice with cold acetone (−20 °C). After briefly air drying, samples were mixed with 1× sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The assay was performed according to the antibody manufacturer's ChIP assay kit protocol (Millipore). Briefly, 1 × 107 BMVEC (transduced with Ad-Con, Ad-CA-STAT5A, and Ad-DN-STAT5A at 100 pfu/cells) were grown in 100-mm dishes, and cross-linking was accomplished by adding formaldehyde to final concentration of 1% (v/v), incubating at room temperature for 10 min. The samples were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing protease, and the cells were scraped into conical tubes, pelleted, and resuspended in ChIP lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). After a 10-min incubation on ice, the cells were sonicated to shear DNA to lengths between 200 and 1000 base pairs. After centrifuging for 10 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C, the A260 of the lysates was measured. Then 60 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) were added to the sonicated lysates and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h to reduce the nonspecific binding. Anti-STAT5 immunoprecipitation antibody (C17; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the supernatant and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotator. As a negative control, the primary antibody was omitted, and the supernatant was incubated with 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose. The agarose beads were pelleted by gentle centrifugation (700–1000 rpm at 4 °C, ∼1 min) and washed for 3–5 min on a rotating platform with 1 ml of each of the buffers listed in the following order: low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl); high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl); LiCl buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% SDC, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The DNA-transcription factor complex was eluted from the antibody by adding 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) to the pelleted protein A-agarose-antibody-STAT5 complex. 5 m NaCl (20 μl) was added to the eluates, and the STAT5-DNA cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h. Ten μl of 0.5 m EDTA, 20 μl 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and 2 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K were added to the eluates and incubated for 1 h at 45 °C. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in an appropriate buffer for PCR. BMVEC at 75% confluence were infected with Ad-Con, Ad-CA-STAT5A, or Ad-DN-STAT5 at 100 pfu/cell. The infected cells were cultured for 48 h with complete medium at 33 °C and starved for an additional 24 h after two washes with PBS. Total RNA from 5 × 105 cells for each sample was extracted using the RNeasy microRNA kit (Qiagen). Each sample was analyzed on a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer and Agilent RNA 6000 NanoChip to verify RNA quantity and quality, respectively, and RNA from three independent experiments was pooled. Ten μg of total RNA per sample were used for cDNA synthesis using oligo(dT)15 as primer (Promega). After adding EtOH to precipitate the cDNA, the samples were stored overnight at −20 °C. The cDNA samples were purified and quantified with a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer, and the size distribution determined on an Agilent RNA 6000 NanoChip. The cDNA samples were then sent to Roche NimbleGen (Madison, WI) for mouse gene expression array analysis on a fee-for-service basis. We jointly analyzed RMA (“robust multichip analysis”) (8.Irizarry R.A. Bolstad B.M. Collin F. Cope L.M. Hobbs B. Speed T.P. Summaries of Affymetrix GeneChip probe level data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (4034) Google Scholar) normalized intensity values from the three experiments (CON = empty virus, CA = CA-STAT5A, DN = DN-STAT5A), using an empirical Bayes method for gene expression data (9.Kendziorski C.M. Newton M.A. Lan H. Gould M.N. On parametric empirical Bayes methods for comparing multiple groups using replicated gene expression profiles.Stat. Med. 2003; 22: 3899-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This method grouped genes into five different patterns (P1: CON = CA = DN; P2: CON = CA! = DN; P3: CON! = CA = DN; P4: CA! = CON = DN; P5: CON! = CA! = DN) based on their posterior probabilities of belonging to these prespecified groups. We further summarized the genes that are differentially expressed between CON and CA (and differentially expressed between CA and DN) by combining data sets from P4 and P5. Genes expressed at low levels in CA (arbitrary signal level of 200 or less) were filtered out. Fold change (CA/CON) was calculated, and an arbitrary value of 5 was used as the cut-off. Collagen gels were prepared according to a previous report (4.Yang X. Qiao D. Meyer K. Friedl A. Signal transducers and activators of transcription mediate fibroblast growth factor-induced vascular endothelial morphogenesis.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1668-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 12-well tissue culture plate was prechilled at −20 °C and coated with rat tail collagen I (1.3 μg/ml; 500 μl/well; BD Biosciences). The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to allow the collagen to solidify. Brain EC (15,000 cells/well) were seeded on the surface of the collagen gel in starvation medium. After 12–24 h, images of the tube structures were captured under phase contrast microscopy using a SPOT RT Slider digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) and analyzed using ImageJ software. Tube length was assessed by drawing a line along each tubule and measuring the length of the line in pixels. Tube length was measured for each sample in five nonoverlapping fields under 200× original magnification. BMVEC were seeded onto 6-well plates at 5 × 105 cells/well and grown to confluence prior to a 24-h starvation period in serum-free DMEM. A single scratch wound was introduced in the monolayer using a micropipette tip, and the medium was replaced with conditioned medium from differently treated BMVEC. Wound closure was monitored for 48 h. BMVEC invasion was assayed using modified invasion chambers with polycarbonate PVP-free Nucleopore filters (8 μm pore size), coated with 25 μg/filter Matrigel (BD Bioscience). Starved BMVEC (2 × 105 cells/well) without treatment or infected with Ad-Con, Ad-CA-STAT5A, or Ad-DN-STAT5A and suspended in serum-free DMEM were added to the upper chamber. Medium containing 0.2% FBS or conditioned media from STAT5A overexpressing BMVEC was placed in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. At the end of a 48-h incubation period, the cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed with a cotton swab, and cells on the lower surface of the filter were stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml). Cells on the lower surface were counted, and each assay was performed in triplicate. Conditioned media (5 ml each) from STAT5A overexpressing MBVEC were incubated with goat anti-mouse PLF antibody (60 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or an equivalent amount of goat serum at 4 °C for 2 h and then depleted with 300 μl of protein A beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The supernatant volumes were reduced to 2 ml by vacuum concentration for about 1 h at 4 °C. The resultant preparations were then analyzed for PLF content by TCA precipitation followed by Western blot. Aliquots of PLF-depleted conditioned media were then mixed with Matrigel at a 1:1 ratio yielding a final Matrigel concentration of 6.5 mg/ml. Then 0.6 ml of the media-Matrigel mixture were injected subcutaneously into the bilateral flanks of athymic nude mice (6–8 weeks). Each group contained three mice (six plugs in total). The same volumes and concentrations of Matrigel containing 20 ng/ml FGF2 and 1 μg/ml heparin, with or without goat anti-PLF antibody (final concentration, 10 μg/ml; goat serum served as control), were injected into another group of mice as controls. Matrigel plugs were harvested after 8 days, photos were taken, and the plugs were fixed in 10% formalin, processed, and embedded in paraffin to assess EC invasion. We have recently shown that STAT5 orchestrates FGF-induced endothelial cell migration, invasion, and tube formation (4.Yang X. Qiao D. Meyer K. Friedl A. Signal transducers and activators of transcription mediate fibroblast growth factor-induced vascular endothelial morphogenesis.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1668-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that this activity involves a secreted factor, we expressed CA-STAT5 or DN-STAT5 in BMVEC by adenoviral transduction (Fig. 1A), collected conditioned medium, and added it to native BMVEC cultures. Consistent with our previously reported observations (4.Yang X. Qiao D. Meyer K. Friedl A. Signal transducers and activators of transcription mediate fibroblast growth factor-induced vascular endothelial morphogenesis.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1668-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), conditioned media from CA-STAT5-transduced cells did not affect endothelial cell proliferation compared with conditioned media from cells treated with empty virus or DN-STAT5-transduced cells (Fig. 1B). However, conditioned media from CA-STAT5-transduced cells stimulated BMVEC invasion (Fig. 1C) and tube formation (Fig. 1D), two processes essential for angiogenesis. These observations indicate that STAT5 activation in EC leads to the secretion of a single or multiple factors that specifically promote invasion and tube formation but not mitogenesis via an autocrine loop. To identify the factor (or factors) secreted in response to STAT5 activation, we compared gene expression signatures between BMVEC transduced with CA-STAT5A, empty virus or DN-STAT5A using the NimbleGen platform and an empirical Bayes analysis method. After eliminating genes expressed at low levels (see “Experimental Procedures” for details), we identified 31 transcripts (47 probe sets) encoding 20 unique genes that were overexpressed in CA-STAT5 at least 5-fold (Table 1). Two of the genes (Cish and Socs2) are known STAT5 targets; others, involved in intracellular signaling (SPrr2a, Rgs16, and ElmoD1) or the ubiquitination pathway (Dub2 and Dub3), have not previously been linked to STAT5 signaling. Interestingly, in the context of these studies, at least six of the transcripts encode secreted proteins (Apo10a, Serpina3f, Col28a1, Prl2c2, Prl2c5, and Igfbp5). qRT-PCR confirmed the induction of the transcription of Prl2c2 (PLF1) and Prl2c5 (PLF4) by CA-STAT5 (Fig. 2A). Importantly, Western blotting with an antibody that detects mouse PLF (PLF1 and PLF4) demonstrated the secretion of PLF into the conditioned medium of BMVEC transduced with CA-STAT5 (Fig. 2B). The induction of PLF expression was not limited to BMVEC cells but was also observed in ECs from bone and prostate (Fig. 2C). Unless otherwise specified, we refer subsequently to PLF without differentiating between PLF1 and PLF4, which share a high degree of homology.TABLE 1Genes induced by CA-STAT5A OverexpressionTranscriptGene symbolFold inductionPredicted protein (function)XM_111219EG23774958.6BC010818Sprr2a24.7Small proline-rich protein 2A, cornifin familyXM_001000192LOC66823122.3AK146137EG22660419.5NM_177744Apol10a19.4Apolipoprotein L 10ANM_001033335Serpina3f19.1Serine protease inhibitor A3FAK154426Gm1052218.1BC049968Rgs1617.2Regulator of G protein signaling 16BC027400Aqp312.2Aquaporin 3 (promotes water transport across cell membranes)NM_001037865Col28a112.1Collagen type XXVIII α1 (may act as cell-binding protein)XM_133360LOC23303810.7AK132394Slco2b110.4Solute carrier organic anion transporter family, member 2B1BC063328Scin10.1Scinderin (calcium-dependent actin-severing and -capping protein)BC056203Prl2c2 (PLF1)9.7Prolactin family 2, subfamily c, member 2; Proliferin-1BC106153Socs29.3Suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (STAT-induced STAT inhibitor 2)NM_001013824EG4353378.0NM_053080Aldh1a37.9Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A3NM_001040611Peg107.7Paternally expressed 10BC025512Rnf1837.6Ring finger protein 183NM_177769Elmod17.2ELMO/CED-12 domain containing 1NM_017474Clca37.2Chloride channel accessory 3 (pseudogene)BC003783Cish (Cis)7.0Cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein (STAT inhibitor)NM_181852Prl2c56.8Prolactin family 2, subfamily c, member 5; Proliferin-4NM_001037919EG6238986.3XM_890107Dub36.3Deubiquitinating enzyme 3NM_010089Dub25.8Deubiquitinating enzyme 2XM_990379EG6674035.2BC030929D630039A035.1NM_010518Igfbp55.0Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5XM_892460EG5465395.0XM_994582EG6668625.0 Open table in a new tab We have previously observed the activation of STAT5 after exposing EC to FGF2 or FGF8b (4.Yang X. Qiao D. Meyer K. Friedl A. Signal transducers and activators of transcription mediate fibroblast growth factor-induced vascular endothelial morphogenesis.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1668-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether these growth factors and VEGF, another powerful angiogenesis stimulator, induce PLF secretion. Indeed, abundant PLF is detected in the conditioned medium of BMVEC treated with FGF2 or FGF8b (Fig. 3). Only minimal PLF secretion is seen in response to VEGF, which may be due to a loss of VEGF signaling pathway components in the immortalized endothelial cell line used in these experiments. Importantly, transduction with DN-STAT5 abolishes the growth factor-induced secretion of PLF. Together, these observations are consistent with the novel finding that STAT5 activation is both necessary and sufficient for FGF-induced PLF secretion. It has been reported that inducible PLF gene transcription in response to serum growth factors involves activator protein 1 (AP-1) (12.Mordacq J.C. Linzer D.I.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6013-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); however, the regulation of PLF expression remains incompletely understood. To test whether STAT5 participates directly in the transcriptional regulation of PLF, we examined STAT5 binding to the PLF1 promoter by ChIP. Transduction of BMVEC with CA-STAT5 led to a significant increase in STAT5 binding to the PLF1 promoter region, as detected by qRT-PCR using three different primer pairs (Fig. 4). These observations suggest that STAT5 binds to the PLF1 gene in an activation-dependent manner. To examine a potential role for PLF in endothelial cell migration, invasion, and tube formation, we decided to disrupt expression of this protein by RNAi. shRNA constructs targeting PLF were stably expressed in BMVEC by lentiviral transduction followed by selection in Puromycin. qRT-PCR demonstrated a 95–99% reduction of baseline PLF1 and PLF4 expression (Fig. 5A). Next, we examined whether the shRNA construct can suppress PLF induction by active STAT5. shRNA expressing clones and controls were transduced with CA-STAT5A or DN-STAT5A or control virus.

https://openalex.org/W2090538188,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) mediates antibody diversification by deaminating deoxycytidines to deoxyuridine within immunoglobulin genes. However, it also generates genome-wide DNA lesions, leading to transformation. Though the biochemical properties of AID have been described, its 3-dimensional structure has not been determined. Hence, to investigate the relationship between the primary structure and biochemical characteristics of AID, we compared the properties of human and bony fish AID, since these are most divergent in amino acid sequence. We show that AIDs of various species have different catalytic rates that are thermosensitive and optimal at native physiological temperatures. Zebrafish AID is severalfold more catalytically robust than human AID, while catfish AID is least active. This disparity is mediated by a single amino acid difference in the C terminus. Using functional assays supported by models of AID core and surface structure, we show that this residue modulates activity by affecting ssDNA binding. Furthermore, the cold-adapted catalytic rates of fish AID result from increased ssDNA binding affinity at lower temperatures. Our work suggests that AID may generate DNA damage with variable efficiencies in different organisms, identifies residues critical in regulating AID activity, and provides insights into the evolution of the APOBEC family of enzymes.—Dancyger, A.

https://openalex.org/W2063091298,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are synthesized as proproteins that undergo proteolytic processing by furin/subtilisin proprotein convertases to release the active ligand. Here we study processing of BMP5/6/7/8 proteins, including the Drosophila orthologs Glass Bottom Boat (Gbb) and Screw (Scw) and human BMP7. Gbb and Scw have three functional furin/subtilisin proprotein convertase cleavage sites; two between the prodomain and ligand domain, which we call the Main and Shadow sites, and one within the prodomain, which we call the Pro site. In Gbb each site can be cleaved independently, although efficient cleavage at the Shadow site requires cleavage at the Main site, and remarkably, none of the sites is essential for Gbb function. Rather, Gbb must be processed at either the Pro or Main site to produce a functional ligand. Like Gbb, the Pro and Main sites in Scw can be cleaved independently, but cleavage at the Shadow site is dependent on cleavage at the Main site. However, both Pro and Main sites are essential for Scw function. Thus, Gbb and Scw have different processing requirements. The BMP7 ligand rescues gbb mutants in Drosophila, but full-length BMP7 cannot, showing that functional differences in the prodomain limit the BMP7 activity in flies. Furthermore, unlike Gbb, cleavage-resistant BMP7, although non-functional in rescue assays, activates the downstream signaling cascade and thus retains some functionality. Our data show that cleavage requirements evolve rapidly, supporting the notion that changes in post-translational processing are used to create functional diversity between BMPs within and between species. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are synthesized as proproteins that undergo proteolytic processing by furin/subtilisin proprotein convertases to release the active ligand.

Furthermore, unlike Gbb, cleavage-resistant BMP7, although non-functional in rescue assays, activates the downstream signaling cascade and thus retains some functionality. Our data show that cleavage requirements evolve rapidly, supporting the notion that changes in post-translational processing are used to create functional diversity between BMPs within and between species."
https://openalex.org/W2114308272,"Lung injury is marked by a persistent self-propagating inflammation within the pulmonary tissue that is initiated by the migration of leukocytes into the alveolar space. Recent work has demonstrated that neuronal guidance proteins are involved into the orchestration of leukocyte migration. Neogenin is a crucial guidance receptor for axonal migration, yet its role during leukocyte migration and acute inflammation is to date unknown. Here, we report that neogenin influences neutrophil migration across endothelial HMEC-1 and alveolar A549 monolayers in vitro. In vivo, Neo1(-/-) mice demonstrated 59% reduced cell count, 41% reduced TNF-α, and 76% reduced IL-6 levels within the alveolar space during lung injury. In studies employing chimeric animals, the presence of Neo1(-/-) bone marrow was associated with a 42% reduction of cell count and reduced inflammatory changes within pulmonary tissue during lung injury. The functional inhibition of neogenin through antibody injection confirmed these results and the role of neogenin for the inflammatory changes within the alveolar space. Previously unappreciated, the guidance receptor neogenin has a significant effect on the orchestration of leukocyte migration and the control of acute inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2026198864,"c-Abl is a tyrosine kinase involved in many cellular processes, including cell cycle control and proliferation. However, little is known about its substrates. Here, we show that c-Abl directly phosphorylates diacylglycerol kinase α (DGKα), an important regulator of many cellular events through its conversion of diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid. We found that DGKα was transported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to serum starvation, and serum restoration induced the nuclear export of the enzyme to the cytoplasm. This serum-induced export involves two tyrosine kinases, c-Src and c-Abl. The latter, c-Abl, is activated by c-Src, phosphorylates DGKα, and shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a direction opposite to that of DGKα in response to serum restoration. Moreover, an in vitro phosphorylation assay using purified mutants of DGKα identified Tyr-218 as a site of phosphorylation by c-Abl. We confirmed these results for endogenous DGKα using an antibody specific for phospho-Tyr-218, and this phosphorylation was necessary for the serum-induced export of DGKα. These results demonstrate that the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of DGKα is orchestrated by tyrosine phosphorylation by the Src-activated tyrosine kinase c-Abl and that this phosphorylation is important for regulating the function of cytoplasmic and/or nuclear DGKα. c-Abl is a tyrosine kinase involved in many cellular processes, including cell cycle control and proliferation.

Cellular activities are controlled by various substances, including lipids. Lipids are the principal components not only of the cytoplasmic membrane but also of the membrane structure of organelles, including the mitochondria, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus. In addition, lipids have important roles in signal transduction. The cytoplasmic membrane contains phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, which is hydrolyzed to diacylglycerol (DG) 3The abbreviations used are:DGdiacylglycerol kinaseDGKdiacylglycerol kinasePAphosphatidic acidRVHrecoverin homologyMBPmaltose-binding proteinaaamino acidsKNkinase-negativeRDregulatory domain. and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate by phospholipase Cβ upon stimulation.

Thus, DG is an important lipid messenger in signal transduction. diacylglycerol kinase diacylglycerol kinase phosphatidic acid recoverin homology maltose-binding protein amino acids kinase-negative regulatory domain. Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) phosphorylates DG to produce phosphatidic acid (PA) (1.Hodgkin M.N. Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Michell R.H. Pemberton A.J. Wakelam M.J. Diacylglycerols and phosphatidates.

PA is also an activator for many other kinases, including phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (2.Jones D.R. Sanjuan M.A. Mérida I.

Phosphatidic acid-mediated mitogenic activation of mTOR signaling.Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Therefore, DGK is thought to be one of the key enzymes in lipid signal transduction. Mammalian DGKs have 10 subtypes and are categorized into five groups, depending on their primary structure (6.Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Yasuda S. Kanoh H. Diacylglycerol kinases. Why so many of them?.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 793-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). All DGKs, except DGKθ, have two cysteine-rich regions (C1A and C1B domains) in the regulatory domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus. DGKθ has three C1 domains, and catalytic domains of type II DGKs are separated. In addition to these domains, they have different structures, depending on their groups. Type I DGKs, DGKα, -β, and -γ, have an EF-hand motif and a recoverin homology (RVH) domain. Type II DGKs, DGKδ, -η, and -κ, have a pleckstrin homology domain instead of an EF-hand and RVH domain at the N terminus. DGKδ and -η have a sterile α motif domain at the C terminus. DGKκ has an EPAP repeat at the N terminus and a PDZ binding domain at the C terminus. DGKϵ is a Type III DGK, and it contains only a C1 domain. Type IV DGKs, DGKζ and -ι, have a myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate phosphorylation site-like region at the N terminus and four ankyrin repeats at the C terminus. Finally, DGKθ, which is a Type V DGK, has a proline- and glycine-rich domain and a pleckstrin homology domain with an overlapping Ras association domain. DGKs are thought to be involved in development, differentiation, construction of neural networks, and immunity (7.Zha Y. Marks R. Ho A.W. Peterson A.C. Janardhan S. Brown I. Praveen K. Stang S.

However, subtype-specific functions and regulatory mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Some DGKs show translocation to the plasma membrane, where DG is produced, in response to various stimulations (8.Shirai Y. Segawa S. Kuriyama M. Goto K. Sakai N. Saito N.

However, lipid metabolism also exists in the nucleus, and the production of DG and PA in the nucleus has been reported (11.Martelli A.M. Tabellini G. Bortul R. Manzoli L. Bareggi R. Baldini G. Grill V. Zweyer M. Narducci P. Cocco L.

Moreover, it was reported that DGKζ, -θ, and -γ were localized in the nucleus (14.Goto K. Kondo H. A 104-kDa diacylglycerol kinase containing ankyrin-like repeats localizes in the cell nucleus.Proc.

Cell Res. 2003; 287: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that DGKs are important for nuclear DG/PA metabolism. In a series of experiments aimed at elucidating the subtype-specific functions of DGKs, we found that DGKα shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. However, DGKα does not have a conserved nuclear localization signal or a nuclear export signal. Therefore, we tried to clarify the mechanism of DGKα nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling and found that the nuclear export of the enzyme is regulated by phosphorylation at Tyr-218 by C-Abl. NIH3T3 cells and COS-7 cells were purchased from the RIKEN Cell Bank. DDT1-MF2 (DTT) cells were obtained from B. B. Fredholm (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). The plasmids encoding either wild-type Src or a kinase-negative Src C-terminally fused to a FLAG tag were obtained from Dr. Fukami (Kobe University, Kobe, Japan). The plasmids encoding either wild-type c-Abl or a kinase negative c-Abl were kindly provided by Dr. Tanaka (Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan). The anti-GFP antibodies were made in house, and the anti-DGKα antibodies were described previously (18.Goto K. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Yuasa H. Sakane F. Kanoh H.

We purchased peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit and mouse IgG from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA) and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-guinea pig IgG from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA) as secondary antibodies. DGKα siRNA from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. was donated by Dr. Yamashita and Dr. Akifusa (Kyusyu University, Fukuoka, Japan) (19.Kamio N. Akifusa S. Yamashita Y.

COS-7 and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nacalitesque, Kyoto, Japan). All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. All media contained 25 mm glucose, and they were all buffered with 44 mm NaHCO3 and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). The fetal bovine serum used was not heat-inactivated. The constructs encoding DGKα N-terminally fused to GFP (GFP-DGKα) were described previously (8.Shirai Y. Segawa S. Kuriyama M. Goto K. Sakai N.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24760-24766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To construct the plasmid encoding DGKα with the substitution of Phe for Tyr-218 (Y218F), mutagenesis was carried out as described by the manufacturer's protocol using a QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers for Y218F were 5′-AGACCCAAGAGGTTCCCCAGGCCTGTCTTCTGCAACCTGTGCGAGTCG-3′ and 5′-CGACTCGCACAGGTTGCAGAAGACAGGCCTGGGGAACCTCTTGGGTCTC-3′. The mutation was confirmed by verifying its sequence. cDNA fragments of either wild-type or kinase-negative c-Abl with a HindIII site at the N terminus and a KpnI site at the C terminus were produced by PCR using mouse c-Abl cDNA as the template. The PCR products were first subcloned into a pUC118 vector (Takara, Shiga, Japan). After digestion with HindIII and KpnI, the cDNA encoding each fragment was subcloned into the HindIII and KpnI site in the pEGFP-C1 vector or the pDsRed-Monomer-C1 vector (Clontech). The primers used were 5′-TTAAGCTTCGGCCACCATGGGGCAGCCTGGA-3′ and 5′-TTGGTACCGTCCTCCGGACAATGTCGCT-3′. NIH3T3 cells (7.5 × 104 cells/dish) grown on a glass bottom dish (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) were transfected using 3 μl of FuGENETM6 Transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and 1 μg of DNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were cultured at 37 °C for about 24 h before use. Cy3 and GFP fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The GFP fluorescence was monitored at 488 nm using an argon laser for excitation with a 515-nm-long pass barrier filter. Cy3 fluorescence was monitored at 543 nm using a HeNe 1 laser for excitation with a 560–615-nm band pass filter. Quantitation of the subcellular distribution of the GFP fusion proteins was defined as described below. The cells in which the ratio of the GFP fluorescence intensity of the cytoplasm and the nucleus was under 0.5 were defined as “only in the cytoplasm,” and the cells in which the ratio was 0.5–0.7 were defined as “abundantly in the cytoplasm.” If the ratio was over 0.7, the cells were defined as “equally in the cytoplasm and the nucleus.” Fractionation was performed as described previously (20.Irie N. Sakai N. Ueyama T. Kajimoto T. Shirai Y. Saito N. Subtype- and species-specific knockdown of PKC using short interfering RNA.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 or DDT cells were harvested and resuspended in cytoplasmic lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cells were incubated on ice for 15 min. Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.4%. Cells were vortexed vigorously for 10 s and then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 s. The supernatant was kept as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was washed twice in lysis buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The tube was vigorously rotated at 4 °C for 15 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 18,000 × g. The supernatant was designated as the nuclear fraction. Nuclear fractions were subjected to immunoblotting. The lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with wild-type or kinase-negative GFP-c-Abl were incubated with rotation with an anti-GFP antibody immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads in homogenizing buffer without Triton-X 100 at 4 °C for 2 h. After incubation, the protein A-Sepharose beads were washed with c-Abl kinase buffer three times. Plasmids (∼32 μg) were electroporated into COS-7 cells using a gene pulser (Bio-Rad, 975 microfarads, 220 mV) or transfected into NIH3T3 cells using the FuGENETM6 transfection reagent. After being cultured, the cells were harvested and centrifuged at 5,500 × g for 3 min. The cells were resuspended in homogenizing buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate) and sonicated (UD-210 TOMY, Tokyo, Japan; output 3, 15 s, two times). For immunoblotting, the samples were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, followed by blotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 5% skim milk in 0.01 m PBS containing 0.03% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS-T, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 30 min. After three rinses with PBS-T, the immunoreactive bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For the preparation of the anti-phospho-Tyr-218 of DGKα antibody, an oligopeptide corresponding to amino acids 213–223 of pig DGKα containing phospho-Tyr-218 (FPRPVpYVNLCE) was used as an antigen. The synthetic peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and 20 μg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated antigen was emulsified and injected into a 10-week-old female guinea pig. Booster injections (20 μg each) were given at 2-week intervals. Three days after the sixth boost, serum was collected and purified with an affinity column using the antigen peptide. cDNA fragments of DGKα fragments with an EcoRI site at the N terminus and a SalI site at the C terminus were produced by PCR using pig DGKα cDNA as the template. The PCR products were first subcloned into a pUC118 vector (TAKARA, Shiga, Japan). After digestion with EcoRI and SalI, the cDNA encoding each fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites in the pMAL-C2 vector (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA). The primers for the DGKα regulatory domain (bp 1–1116) were 5′-TTGAATTCATGTCCAAGGAGAGGGGG-3′ and 5′-TTGTCGACTCAGTTAGAAACGGGGTC-3′. The primers for RDΔhinge (318 aa) (bp 1–954), for RVH-EF-C1 domains (252 aa) (bp 1–756), for RVH-EF-C1a (204 aa) (bp 1–612), and for RVH-EF hand (112 aa) (bp 1–336) were 5′-TTGTCGACTCAACACTCATGGCCCATGGC-3′, 5′-TTGTCGACTCAAACACAGGGCAGGGCCTTCAT-3′, 5′-TTGTCGACTCACTGCCCATTGTCCTTCAA-3′, and 5′-TTGTCGACTCAGTCTTCTGGCCGGCCGCC-3′, respectively. DH5α cells were transformed with expression plasmids for MBP fusion proteins. MBP fusion proteins were expressed and purified according to the manufacturer's protocols (New England Biolabs). Expression of MBP fusion proteins was induced with 0.3 mm IPTG at 25 °C for 16 h. The induced cells were harvested and sonicated in column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DDT, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, MBP fusion proteins were applied to amyrose resin and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing with column buffer, to cut MBP, 10× factor Xa cleavage buffer and factor Xa were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Eluate was dialyzed against PBS(−). Purified proteins were incubated in c-Abl kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 2 mm DDT, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate) with the precipitants obtained from the immunoprecipitation using an anti-GFP antibody and [γ-32P]ATP (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) for 15 min at 30 °C. Reaction products were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed using BSA2500 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). To specifically detect the cells transfected with c-Abl siRNA, we employed thymidine dimer methods described previously (21.Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. c-Abl is activated by growth factors and Src family kinases and has a role in the cellular response to PDGF.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2400-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μg of siRNA was irradiated with 2.0 J/cm2 UV. The irradiated siRNA (300 nm) and 1 μg of the plasmid encoding GFP-DGKα were simultaneously transfected into 4 × 104 NIH3T3 cells. Twenty-four hours after the transfection, serum was depleted for 24 h, and then serum was added and incubated for 3 h. Before and after serum starvation and 3 h after serum restoration, the cells were fixed. After immunostaining with anti-thymidine dimer (Kyowa Medics), the localization of GFP-DGKα in the thymidine-dimer positive cells was categorized into three groups and plotted. When GFP-DGKα was transfected into NIH3T3 cells, it localized mainly in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus (Fig. 1A, top). However, the percentage of the cells expressing GFP-DGKα both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus gradually increased over a several-day course of culturing (Fig. 1A, bottom). At day 1 (24 h after transfection), the percentage of cells expressing GFP-DGKα only in the cytoplasm was 56% (Fig. 1B), which decreased to 28% at Day 3 (72 h after transfection). In contrast, the percentage of cells expressing GFP-DGKα equally in the cytoplasm and the nucleus increased from 31 to 52% within 3 days (Fig. 1B). To quantify the nuclear localization of the enzyme, the ratio of the cells expressing GFP-DGKα equally in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus to those cells expressing the protein only in the cytoplasm was defined as the nuclear localization index, which is plotted in Fig. 1C. The index increased from 0.55 at day 1 to 1.36 at day 3, indicating that GFP-DGKα was transported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a time-dependent manner. The fact that this nuclear transportation took 2–3 days suggests the lack or shortage of some factor(s) from the medium required for triggering nuclear import. Therefore, we determined the effect of serum depletion on nuclear import. Serum starvation accelerated the rate of the nuclear transportation; significant nuclear transportation was detected within 24 h after serum depletion (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the subsequent restoration of serum induced the export of DGKα from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The nuclear localization index increased from 0.40 to 1.93 during 24 h of serum starvation but reversed to 0.53 within 3 h of serum addition (Fig. 1E), indicating that DGKα shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, depending on the culture conditions. The serum-dependent shuttling of DGKα was also detected in DDT cells derived from Syrian hamster leiomyosarcoma (Fig. 1F), indicating that this phenomenon is not unique to NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, biochemical fractionation followed by immunoblotting revealed that endogenous DGKα also shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in a serum-dependent manner (Fig. 1G). To identify the factor(s) involved in the serum-induced nuclear export of DGKα, we tested several growth factors instead of serum. Among them, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) similarly induced the nuclear export (Fig. 1H), suggesting the involvement of tyrosine kinases in this process. Previous reports showed that tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family protein-tyrosine kinases is required for the recruitment of DGKα to the membrane (12.Irvine R. Nuclear lipid signaling.Sci. STKE. 2000; 2000: re1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin, on the serum-induced nuclear export of DGKα. The herbimycin treatment significantly inhibited the movement of DGKα from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). Next, we checked for the presence of Lck and/or c-Src in the NIH3T3 cells because it has been reported that c-Src and Lck directly phosphorylate DGKα (9.Baldanzi G. Cutrupi S. Chianale F. Gnocchi V. Rainero E. Porporato P. Filigheddu N. van Blitterswijk W.J. Parolini O. Bussolino F. Sinigaglia F. Graziani A.

The cells endogenously express c-Src but not Lck (Fig. 2B), suggesting that c-Src is a possible candidate. However, GFP-tagged c-Src mainly localized in the cytoplasm under all of the conditions we tested (data not shown), suggesting that the serum-induced nuclear export of DGKα involves an additional factor, which is regulated by c-Src and phosphorylates DGKα in the nucleus. c-Abl tyrosine kinase was an attractive candidate as an additional factor regulating the nuclear export of DGKα because it is activated by Src (21.Plattner R.

Therefore, we checked if NIH3T3 cells endogenously express c-Abl, and we determined the effects of a specific c-Abl inhibitor, STI571, on the serum-induced nuclear exportation of DGKα. c-Abl is endogenously expressed in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2B), and STI571 inhibited the nuclear export of GFP-DGKα in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting the involvement of c-Abl. To confirm it, we used the irradiated siRNA of c-Abl, as described under “Methods.” First we checked whether endogenous c-Abl was down-regulated by the irradiated siRNA treatment. Fig. 2E indicates that endogenous c-Abl was down-regulated in the cells transfected with siRNA, which was recognized by anti-T-T dimer antibody. We then investigated the localization of GFP-DGKα in the T-T-positive cells. As shown in Fig. 2F, the serum-induced nuclear exportation of DGKα was significantly inhibited by the c-Abl siRNA treatment, confirming the importance of the enzyme for the exportation. Next, we investigated the shuttling of c-Abl in response to serum. GFP-c-Abl showed nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling in response to serum, but the direction was opposite that of DGKα; GFP-c-Abl was exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by serum depletion, whereas it was imported to the nucleus by serum restoration (Fig. 3A), fitting with our hypothesis that c-Abl directly regulates the serum-induced nuclear export of DGKα. Furthermore, co-expression of mDsRed-tagged c-Abl enhanced the cytoplasmic localization of GFP-DGKα before serum depletion (Fig. 3B); co-expression of c-Abl increased the percentage of cells expressing GFP-DGKα only in the cytoplasm from 60 to 80% and decreased that of the cells both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus from 30 to 15%. In addition, co-expression of c-Abl inhibited the serum depletion-induced nuclear import of DGKα; the nuclear index was lower than 1 in the presence of c-Abl (Fig. 3B, bottom). Together, these results suggest that growth factors, including PDGF, in the serum activate c-Src and that activated c-Src phosphorylates c-Abl, resulting in the activation and nuclear import of c-Abl, and finally, c-Abl phosphorylates DGKα in the nucleus to export DGKα. To confirm this hypothesis, we tried to detect the c-Src-dependent activation of c-Abl using an anti-phospho-Tyr-412-c-Abl antibody, because the phosphorylation of Tyr-412 is a marker for the activation of c-Abl (21.Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A.

When co-transfected with Src-FLAG, the tyrosine phosphorylation at 412 on GFP-c-Abl KN was enhanced by H2O2 stimulation, which is an activator of c-Src (Fig. 4A). Serum restoration induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of GFP-c-Abl KN only when Src-FLAG was co-expressed (Fig. 4B) and tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by herbimycin (Fig. 4B), indicating that serum-activated c-Src phosphorylates c-Abl in NIH3T3 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2064123874,"Although diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major cause of end-stage renal disease, the mechanism of dysfunction has not yet been clarified. We previously reported that in diabetes proinsulin-producing bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) fuse with hepatocytes and neurons. Fusion cells are polyploidy and produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, ultimately causing diabetic complications. In this study, we assessed whether the same mechanism is involved in DN. We performed bone marrow transplantation from male GFP-Tg mice to female C57BL/6J mice and produced diabetes by streptozotocin (STZ) or a high-fat diet. In diabetic kidneys, massive infiltration of BMDCs and tubulointerstitial injury were prominent. BMDCs and damaged tubular epithelial cells were positively stained with proinsulin and TNF-α. Cell fusion between BMDCs and renal tubules was confirmed by the presence of Y chromosome. Of tubular epithelial cells, 15.4% contain Y chromosomes in STZ-diabetic mice, 8.6% in HFD-diabetic mice, but only 1.5% in nondiabetic mice. Fusion cells primarily expressed TNF-α and caspase-3 in diabetic kidney. These in vivo findings were confirmed by in vitro coculture experiments between isolated renal tubular cells and BMDCs. It was concluded that cell fusion between BMDCs and renal tubular epithelial cells plays a crucial role in DN."
https://openalex.org/W1968677547,"SF-1 is a key transcription factor for all steroidogenic genes. It up-regulates the expression of the steroidogenic Cyp11a1 gene in the adrenal in a pathway stimulated by cAMP through HIPK3-mediated JNK/c-Jun phosphorylation. In the present study, we have investigated the factors mediating cAMP-dependent HIPK3 action to potentiate the activity of SF-1 for Cyp11a1 transcription in mouse adrenocortical Y1 cells. We found Daxx, a HIPK kinase substrate in the apoptosis pathway, was phosphorylated by HIPK3 at Ser-669 in response to cAMP stimulation. Daxx participated in SF-1-dependent Cyp11a1 expression as shown by experiments involving both overexpression and down-regulation via a dominant negative Daxx mutant. The S669A mutant of Daxx, which could not be phosphorylated by HIPK3, lost the ability to potentiate SF-1 activity for Cyp11a1 expression. The enhancement of SF-1 activity by Daxx required JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation. Thus, Daxx functioned as a signal transducer linking cAMP-stimulated HIPK3 activity with JNK/c-Jun phosphorylation and SF-1-dependent Cyp11a1 transcription for steroid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2008233219,"Notch1 receptor functions as a critical controller of cell fate decisions and also as a key regulator of cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation in invertebrates and vertebrates. In this study, we have demonstrated that the adaptor protein Fe65 attenuates Notch1 signaling via the accelerated degradation of the membrane-tethered Notch1 in the cytoplasm. Fe65 also suppresses Notch1 transcriptional activity via the dissociation of the Notch1-IC-recombining binding protein suppressor of hairless (RBP)-Jk complex within the nucleus. Fe65 is capable of forming a trimeric complex with Itch and membrane-tethered Notch1, and Fe65 enhances the protein degradation of membrane-tethered Notch1 via an Itch-dependent proteasomal pathway. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Fe65 carries out different functions depending on its location in the regulation of Notch1 signaling."
