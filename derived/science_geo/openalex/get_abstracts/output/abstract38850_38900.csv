https://openalex.org/W1989941131,"Fertilized clam embryos synthesize several new cell-cycle-related proteins. The cloned cDNA and derived amino acid sequences of one of these, cyclin A, are presented here. Immunoblots with an anti-cyclin A antibody reveal that cyclin A is undetectable in oocytes, appears within 15 min of fertilization, and is destroyed near the end of each meiosis and mitosis. We directly tested the ability of cyclin A to induce M phase by injecting SP6 cyclin A mRNA into Xenopus oocytes, which are arrested at the G2/M border of first meiosis. The injected mRNA was translated, with the result that the Xenopus oocytes entered meiosis. These findings indicate that the rise in cyclin A plays a direct and natural role in driving cells into M phase."
https://openalex.org/W2075362101,"Splicing complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on a native low-percentage polyacrylamide gel. Two distinct heparin-resistant complexes, A and B, are assembled specifically on an RNA precursor containing authentic 5' and 3' splice sites. This assembly is ATP-dependent. Kinetic experiments suggest that complex A is converted with time to a larger, slower migrating complex B. Complexes A and B detected by gel electrophoresis correspond to material sedimenting at 25S and 35S, respectively. Substrate RNA containing only the 3' splice site is capable of forming the smaller complex A but not complex B. Complex A protects sequences upstream of the 3' splice site, encompassing the branch site and polypyrimidine tract from digestion by RNAase T1. U2 snRNA, but not U1 snRNA was detected in both complexes A and B by Northern hybridization analysis. Interestingly, an endogenous large complex containing U2 snRNP could be detected in nuclear extracts."

https://openalex.org/W2118485393,"Trimethyl capping of U2 snRNA has been studied using U2 genes with mutations located in either the 5' flanking or the coding region. A monomethyl (7-methylguanosine) cap is added to U2 cotranscriptionally, trimethylation being posttranscriptional. The immediate 5' flanking sequences have no influence on trimethylation; furthermore, trimethylation is not affected by changing the position and sequence of the cap site. The efficiency of trimethylation is reduced by deleting the Sm binding site from U2 RNA, but it is not altered by other mutations in the coding sequence. Insertion of artificial Sm binding sites either into a mutant U2 from which the natural binding site has been deleted or into SP6 transcripts generated in vitro allows these RNAs to become trimethylated. The trimethylase activity in Xenopus laevis oocytes is cytoplasmic."
https://openalex.org/W1965711974,"Binding of antibodies to effector cells by way of receptors to their constant regions (Fc receptors) is central to the pathway that leads to clearance of antigens by the immune system. The structure and function of this important class of receptors on immune cells is addressed through the molecular characterization of Fc receptors (FcR) specific for the murine immunoglobulin G isotype. Structural diversity is encoded by two genes that by alternative splicing result in expression of molecules with highly conserved extracellular domains and different transmembrane and intracytoplasmic domains. The proteins encoded by these genes are members of the immunoglobulin supergene family, most homologous to the major histocompatibility complex molecule EÎ². Functional reconstitution of ligand binding by transfection of individual FcR genes demonstrates that the requirements for ligand binding are encoded in a single gene. These studies demonstrate the molecular basis for the functional heterogeneity of FcR's, accounting for the possible transduction of different signals in response to a single ligand."
https://openalex.org/W2074005277,"The adenovirus E1a region encodes two closely related gene products: 243 and 289 amino acid phosphoproteins. These proteins differ in their primary sequence only by 46 amino acids unique to the 289 amino acid protein. By constructing single-base substitution mutants we localized two functional regions of these E1a proteins: one required for efficient transcriptional activation, another required for efficient transcriptional repression. The 289 amino acid protein contains both regions and appears to function primarily as a transcriptional activator. The 243 amino acid protein lacks the transcriptional activation domain and appears to function primarily as a transcriptional repressor. Mutations within a highly conserved region define a novel class of transformation-defective mutants. These mutant E1a proteins can still efficiently activate transcription of early viral and cellular genes but cannot repress transcription of target genes. The fact that viral transformation may require a transcriptional repression function provides new insights into the mechanism by which adenovirus transforms cells."
https://openalex.org/W1980428104,"A HeLa cell nuclear extract active in splicing of pre-mRNA has been fractionated to identify the component that interacts with the 3' splice site. The activity that binds this region in an RNAase T1 protection assay copurifies with a 70 kd protein which is recognized by anti-Sm antibodies. Protein blots probed with labeled mRNA precursors either containing or lacking an intact 3' splice site reveal that the 70 kd polypeptide can bind pre-mRNA after immobilization on nitrocellulose and that it shows a preference for sequences located between the 3' splice junction and the site of lariat formation. Cofractionation during chromatography and immunoprecipitation by anti-2,2,7-trimethylguanosine antibodies demonstrate that the 3' splice site binding component associates with small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles in low (1 mM) but not high (15 mM) Mg++ concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2112030247,"The glycoprotein Ib (GPIb), a two-chain integral platelet membrane protein, acts as a receptor for von Willebrand factor. In order to obtain information on the domain involved in this function, as well as on the structural organization of GPIb, the protein has been purified and submitted to limited proteolysis using three different enzymes. The resulting fragments were topographically oriented by means of partial NH2-terminal sequence analysis and immunological identification using monoclonal antibodies. One of these antibodies (LJ-Ib1) inhibited the von Willebrand factor-GPIb interaction completely, one (LJ-P3) partially, and one (LJ-Ib10) had no inhibitory effect. Three distinct fragments, the 38-kDa fragment produced by Serratia marcescens protease as well as the 45- and 35-kDa fragments produced by trypsin, had the same NH2 terminus as the intact GPIb alpha-chain (apparent molecular mass = 140 kDa). These fragments and the alpha-chain reacted with the inhibitory antibodies. On the other hand, three fragments produced by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, one of 92 kDa similar to the previously described macroglycopeptide and two others of 52 and 45 kDa, had NH2-terminal sequences different from that of the GPIb alpha-chain and reacted only with the noninhibitor monoclonal antibody LJIb10. Thus, the binding domain for von Willebrand factor resides near the NH2 terminus of the GPIb alpha-chain, whereas the carbohydrate-rich region is part of the innermost portion of GPIb and does not appear to be involved in the von Willebrand factor binding function."
https://openalex.org/W1533764872,"Infusion of cystamine into the isolated, perfused rat liver resulted in tissue damage preceded by the formation of cystamine-protein mixed disulfides which were mainly detected in the plasma membrane fraction. Hepatotoxicity was prevented when dithiothreitol was infused after cystamine or when the calcium antagonist, verapamil, was co-infused with the disulfide. In isolated hepatocytes, the formation of cystamine-protein mixed disulfides was associated with an inhibition of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase activity and a decreased rate of Ca2+ efflux from the cells. This resulted in intracellular Ca2+ accumulation which was followed by a stimulation of both phospholipid hydrolysis and proteolysis, as indicated by enhanced rates of release of radioactivity from hepatocytes prelabeled with [14C]arachidonate and [14C]valine, respectively. Preincubation of hepatocytes with the calmodulin inhibitor, calmidazolium, or with the phospholipase inhibitors, chlorpromazine and dibucaine, inhibited the stimulation of [14C]arachidonate release by cystamine. However, none of these agents prevented the onset of cystamine toxicity in hepatocytes. In contrast, pretreatment of the cells with antipain or leupeptin, two inhibitors of Ca2+-activated proteases, abolished the stimulation of proteolysis by cystamine and also protected the cells from cystamine toxicity. Our results suggest that the perturbation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis by cystamine is caused by the inhibition of Ca2+ efflux associated with the formation of cystamine-protein mixed disulfides in the plasma membrane and that subsequent cytotoxicity results from Ca2+-activation of a nonlysosomal proteolytic system."
https://openalex.org/W2145167060,"Human apolipoprotein B100 cDNA is 14 kilobases in length and encodes a 4563-amino acid precursor protein. The corresponding human gene has been isolated as a series of overlapping lambda clones and extends over 43 kilobases. The gene comprises 29 exons and 28 introns. The distribution of introns is extremely asymmetrical, most of them appearing in the 5'-terminal one-third of the gene. Although most of the exons fall within the normal size limits for mammalian genes, two are unusually long: 1906 and 7572 base pairs. The latter exon is by far the longest reported for a vertebrate gene."
https://openalex.org/W152429101,"A major sialoglycoprotein (previously called gp105) on the human erythroleukemic cell line K562 was purified, and specific antibodies were raised in a rabbit. A number of different hematopoietic cell lines belonging to erythroid, myeloid, T-lymphoid, and B-lymphoid cell lineages were found to possess glycoproteins that were immunoprecipitated by these antibodies. However, the apparent molecular weights differed between cell lines, ranging from 113,000 to 150,000. In almost all cases, the immune precipitated molecule corresponded to the major sialoglycoprotein of the respective cell. Pulse-chase experiments showed that all cells produced an early precursor form of the molecule of 54 kDa, which was susceptible to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H to give an apoprotein of 52 kDa. Neuraminidase treatment of the mature forms resulted in a characteristic decrease of the mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (apparent molecular weights from 150,000 to 183,000). Amino acid analysis of the glycoprotein isolated from HL-60 cells showed a high content of serine, threonine, and proline, and the carbohydrate composition was compatible with the presence of a large number (approximately 90) of O-linked carbohydrate chains. The name leukosialin is proposed for this sialoglycoprotein, which seems to be widely distributed, but differently glycosylated, on leukocytes with diverse functions. In the following paper (Carlsson, S.R., Sasaki, H., and Fukuda, M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12787-12795), we demonstrate that the structures of O-linked oligosaccharides vary significantly depending on the cells from which leukosialin was isolated."
https://openalex.org/W1480795950,"Monolayer cultures of a rat hepatocyte cell line shown previously to accumulate a nuclear pool of free heparan sulfate chains that are enriched in sulfated glucuronic acid (GlcA) residues (Fedarko, N.S., and Conrad, H.E., (1986) J. Cell Biol. 587-599) were incubated with 35SO4(2-), and the rate of appearance of heparan [35S]sulfate in the nuclei was measured. Heparan [35S]sulfate began to accumulate in the nuclei 2 h after the administration of 35SO4(2-) to the cells and reached a steady state level after 20 h. Heparan [35S]sulfate was lost from the nuclei of prelabeled cells with a t1/2 of 8 h. Chloroquine did not inhibit the transport of heparan sulfate into the nucleus, but increased the t1/2 for the exit of heparan sulfate from the nucleus to 20 h and led to a doubling of the steady state level of nuclear heparan sulfate. Heparan [35S]sulfate which was obtained from the medium or from the cell matrix of a labeled culture and which contained only low levels of GlcA-2-SO4 residues was incubated with cultures of unlabeled cells, and the uptake of the exogenous heparan [35S]sulfate was studied. At 37 degrees C the cells took up proteoheparan [35S]sulfate and transported about 10% of the internalized heparan [35S]sulfate into the nucleus, where it appeared as free chains. The heparan [35S]sulfate isolated from the nucleus was enriched in GlcA-2-SO4 residues, whereas the heparan [35S]sulfate remaining in the rest of the intracellular pool showed a corresponding depletion in GlcA-2-SO4 residues. At 16 degrees C, where endocytosed materials do not enter the lysosomes, the cells also transported exogenous proteoheparan [35S]sulfate to the nucleus with similar processing. Thus, the metabolism of exogenous heparan sulfate by hepatocytes follows the same pathway observed in continuously labeled cells and does not involve lysosomal processing of the internalized heparan sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W1527219367,"A cell surface protein known as T4 (CD4, Leu3), Mr = 55,000, is expressed on the subset of human T lymphocytes which provides helper function for B cell and cytotoxic T cell activities. We show that T4 is constitutively phosphorylated and that phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induces a rapid serine phosphorylation which is followed by a fast dephosphorylation. Within 5 min after PMA treatment, there is a 24% reduction of T4 on the cell surface, by 4 h the loss is nearly complete, and by 20 h T4 is re-expressed. Addition of antigen to a T4+ antigen-reactive T cell clone induces both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation with kinetics similar to that described for PMA. Antigen also causes reduction of cell surface T4, although to a lesser degree than stimulation with PMA. The rapid phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of T4 as well as its movement from the cell surface suggest that T4 functions as a receptor for an unknown ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1585133178,"Strains containing a disrupted structural gene for chitin synthetase (chs1::URA3) are defective in chitin synthetase 1 (Chs1) activity but contain normal amounts of chitin (Bulawa, C.E., Slater, M., Cabib, E., Au-Young, J., Sburlati, A., Adair, L., and Robbins, P. W. (1986) Cell 46, 213-225). We have now detected in such strains a new chitin synthetase activity (Chs2), at levels about 5% of those of Chs1 in wild-type cells. Thus, Chs2 is presumably the physiological agent for chitin deposition in strains with a disrupted CHS1 gene and probably also in wild-type strains. Chs1 and Chs2 share certain properties, such as stimulation by N-acetylglucosamine and by partial proteolysis. They differ sharply, however, in divalent cation specificity and in pH optimum. Chs2 also shows less sensitivity than Chs1 to inhibition by polyoxin D or sodium chloride, a property that was used to demonstrate the presence of Chs2 in wild-type extracts. As in the case of Chs1, most of the Chs2 activity was found to be associated with the plasma membranes. This finding, together with the apparent zymogenic nature of Chs2, is consistent with the hypothesis, previously put forward for Chs1, that localized deposition of chitin is attained by activation of the zymogen form at a specific time and place. Function and significance of the two chitin synthetases are discussed in connection with fungal morphogenesis and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2246321819,"Structures of O-linked oligosaccharides of leukosialin isolated from K562 erythroid, HL-60 promyelocytic, and HSB-2 T-lymphoid cell lines were examined. Leukosialin was isolated by specific immunoprecipitation from cells which were metabolically labeled with [3H]glucosamine, and glycopeptides were isolated after Pronase digestion. O-Linked oligosaccharides were released by alkaline borohydride treatment, and the structures of purified oligosaccharides were elucidated by specific exoglycosidase digestion, Smith degradation, and methylation anaylsis. Oligosaccharides from K562 cells were found to be GalNAcOH, Gal beta 1----3GalNAcOH, NeuNAc alpha 2----6GalNAcOH, NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3GalNAcOH, Gal beta 1----3(NeuNAc alpha 2----6)GalNAcOH, and NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3(NeuNAc alpha 2----6)GalNAcOH. On the other hand, oligosaccharides from HL-60 and HSB-2 cells were found to be NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3GalNAcOH, NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6(Gal beta 1----3)GalNAcOH, Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6(NeuNAc alpha 2----3)Gal beta 1----3)GalNAcOH, and NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6(NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3)GalNAcOH. These results clearly indicate that leukosialin can be differently glycosylated with O-linked chains, and each erythroid or myeloid (and T-lymphoid) cell line expresses a characteristic set of O-linked oligosaccharides which differ in core structures as well as in sialylation."
https://openalex.org/W1505772870,"Caldesmon was purified to homogeneity from both chicken gizzard and bovine aortic smooth muscles. Caldesmon purified from bovine aorta was slightly larger than purified from chicken gizzards (Mr = 140,000) when the two were compared electrophoretically. Caldesmon bound tightly to actin saturating at a molar ratio of 1 monomer per 6.6 actin monomers. Ca2+-calmodulin appeared to reduce the affinity of for actin. Caldesmon was also a potent inhibitor of heavy actomeromyosin ATPase activity producing a maximal effect at a ratio of 1 monomer per 7-10 actin monomers. This effect was also antagonized by Ca2+-calmodulin. While inhibited heavy actomeromyosin ATPase activity, it greatly enhanced binding of both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated heavy meromyosin to actin in the presence of MgATP, reducing the Kd for binding by a factor of 40 for each form of heavy meromyosin. Although we did identify a Ca2+-calmodulin-stimulated caldesmon kinase activity in preparations purified under nondenaturing conditions, we observed no effect of phosphorylation (2 mol of PO4/mol of caldesmon) on the capacity to inhibit heavy actomeromyosin ATPase activity. Our results suggest that could serve some role in smooth muscle function by enhancing cross-bridge affinity while inhibiting actomyosin ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1548951842,"Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I (greater than or equal to 10(-10)M, insulin-like growth factor II (greater than or equal to 10(-9) M), insulin (greater than or equal to 10(-9) M, and epidermal growth factor (EGF, greater than or equal to 10(-11) M) caused rapid membrane ruffling in KB cells. The morphological change was observed within 1 min after the addition of these growth factors and was accompanied by microfilament reorganization, but not by microtubule reorganization. IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin induced morphologically very similar or identical membrane ruffles with the order of potency IGF-I greater than IGF-II greater than insulin, whereas EGF-induced membrane ruffles were morphologically different. KB cells possessed EGF receptors, type I IGF receptors, and insulin receptors, but few or no type II IGF receptors. Monoclonal antibody against type I IGF receptors, which completely inhibited the binding of 125I-IGF-I to the cells but did not inhibit the binding of 125I-insulin, caused marked inhibition of IGF-I (10(-8) M)-stimulated membrane ruffling. IGF-II (10(-8) M)-stimulated membrane ruffling was partially inhibited in the presence of this antibody, but insulin (10(-7) M)-stimulated membrane ruffling was only slightly inhibited. In contrast, monoclonal antibody against insulin receptors blocked insulin (10(-7) M) stimulation, but not IGF-I (10(-8) M) stimulation, of membrane ruffling. Thus, this study provides evidence that IGF-I and insulin act mostly through their own (homologous) receptors and that IGF-II acts by cross-reacting with both type I IGF and insulin (heterologous) receptors in causing rapid alterations in cytoskeletal structure."
https://openalex.org/W2038172814,"In the kalilo strains of N. intermedia, senescence is initiated by insertion of a 9.0 kb foreign nucleotide sequence, kalDNA, into mitochondrial DNA. A 9.0 kb linear DNA plasmid that is structurally homologous to the mitochondrial kalDNA insertion sequences exists in high copy numbers in close association with the nuclei of presenescent and senescent kalilo cells, but is not present in cells of long-lived normal strains. The free kalilo plasmid has not been detected in mitochondria, suggesting that the element does not contain a mitochondrial origin of replication. Unexpectedly, the nuclear plasmid, like the mitochondrial insertion element, follows a strict pattern of maternal inheritance. We surmise that the extramitochondrial plasmid is the etiological precursor of the kalDNA insertion sequences that appear in the mtDNAs of senescent cell lines and conclude that the kalilo element induces senescence because it is a mutator of mitochondrial genes."
https://openalex.org/W1583312727,"The fibronectin receptor is a complex of two cell surface glycopeptides that mediate the binding of cells to fibronectin substrata. To study the structure of this receptor, we have isolated cDNA clones coding for the human fibronectin receptor alpha subunit from a lambda gt11 placental cDNA library. The cDNAs code for 229 amino acids from the COOH terminus of the alpha subunit. The deduced sequence has a hydrophobic region with properties characteristic of a membrane-spanning domain. From the membrane-spanning domain to the COOH terminus are 23-28 amino acids that are likely to constitute the cytoplasmic domain. These results establish the fibronectin receptor alpha subunit as an integral membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W1566481288,"Oxygen exchange between (18O4)Pi in the medium and water accompanies ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the calcium-regulated MgATPase of vertebrate skeletal muscle. Exchange was observed in chemically skinned fibers from rabbit psoas muscle held isometrically and activated by 30 microM free Ca2+. The rate of exchange was approximately proportional to Pi concentration (up to 10 mM) and was characterized by an apparent second order rate constant greater than or equal to 475 M-1 S-1 (pH 7.1, ionic strength 0.2 M, 22 degrees C). Much less exchange occurred in the absence of Ca2+ or when ATP was replaced by ADP. It has been inferred from mechanical experiments that Pi can bind to a force-generating ADP-bound state of actomyosin with resultant suppression of force (Hibberd, M. G., Dantzig, J. A., Trentham, D. R., and Goldman, Y. E. (1985) Science 228, 1317-1319). The oxygen exchange results support this inference by providing direct evidence that Pi in the medium binds at the ATPase catalytic site in activated isometric fibers. The inter-relationship of these two effects involving Pi on mechanochemical coupling in muscle is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2047090545,"Although cholera toxin induces a marked stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in rat adipocyte plasma membranes, the holotoxin induces only a slight increase of cyclic AMP accumulation in intact cells. A similar apparent anomaly is seen with pertussis toxin, which has been shown to inhibit the Gi subunit of adenylate cyclase, and has a greater effect on cAMP accumulation and lipolysis than the activation by cholera toxin of the Gs subunit. To understand better the way in which these bacterial toxins are modifying the adipocyte cells, we prepared adipocyte plasma membranes and submitted them to ADP-ribosylation by cholera and pertussis toxins. During the incubation of control cells, we found endogenous ADP-ribosylation of Gs as a result of sustained stimulation of Gi by adenosine. Our results point to a possible homoeostatic system in which the autonomous adjustment of the basal activity of Gs as a function of that of Gi, under the control of feedback inhibitory ligands, ensures a steady production of cAMP within the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1998511035,"The binding of nominal antigen to Ti alpha-beta heterodimers on MHC-restricted human T cell clones specific for fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FL) was detected by flow cytometry and affinity chromatography. The FL-Ti interaction is of physiologic significance, since T cell activation is induced by cross-linked arrays of FL in the absence of the specific MHC recognition. High antigen valence is required to achieve stable binding to cells and subsequent activation, which is consistent with estimated Ti-FL association constants of less than 3 X 10(5) l/mol. In addition to providing direct evidence that the Ti alpha-beta heterodimer is the receptor for antigen, these data suggest that nominal antigen binding sites exist on the Ti molecules of at least some MHC-restricted clones."
https://openalex.org/W1574466725,"We previously characterized the structural features of the interaction of sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes with nonsolubilizing concentrations of C12E8, the non-ionic detergent octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (Andersen, J.P., le Maire, M., Kragh-Hansen, V., Champeil, P., and Moller, J. V. (1983) Eur. J. Biochem. 134, 205-214). The present study characterizes especially the functional aspects and implications of the detergent-induced perturbation for an understanding of ATPase function. Perturbing detergent decreased Vmax, but left Ca2+ transport intact. Detergent incorporation affected neither the calcium-dependent phosphorylation from ATP, as judged from multimixer quenching experiments, nor the calcium-releasing transition between the two phosphoenzyme forms (Ca2E1P to E2P), as judged from kinetically resolved dual-wavelength measurements with the calcium-sensitive dye antipyrylazo III. However, the decrease in Vmax was accounted for by a decrease in the rate of enzyme dephosphorylation by a factor of 3-4, whereas the Ca2+-dependent transition between the nonphosphorylated enzyme forms (E2 to Ca2E1) was enhanced almost 10-fold. Evidence of a conformational change of E2 by C12E8 toward that of the E1 state to account for the perturbed reactions was obtained from experiments on vanadate reactivity and tryptic degradation pattern. Both direct and steady-state evidence was obtained for an acceleration by ATP of the Ca2E1P to E2P transition which may account for the low affinity modulatory effect of the nucleotide on enzyme turnover. The kinetic data indicated that reduction of ATP hydrolysis by C12E8 coincided with conditions where E2P dephosphorylation becomes rate-limiting (high ATP concentration, low pH, absence of potassium). Otherwise, the Ca2E1P to E2P transition is deduced to be a rate-limiting step for the ATPase cycle, whereas the potential for rate control of the cycle by modulation of the E2 to Ca2E1 transition is very small. Only in special circumstances (absence of potassium, high temperature, and using ITP as a substrate) did this transition become a rate-limiting step, subject to rate enhancement of the whole cycle by detergent perturbation."
https://openalex.org/W1490825000,"Troponin was isolated from striated adductor muscles of the scallop (Chlamys nipponensis akazara), and purified in an active form by DEAE-cellulose (Whatman DE52) column chromatography and subsequent gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300. According to sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and densitometry, Akazara troponin is composed of three components having molecular weights of 52,000, 40,000, and 20,000 in a molar ratio of 1:1:1. The three components were separated from each other by column chromatography in the presence of 6 M urea and 1 mM EDTA on SP-Sephadex C-50 and DEAE-cellulose. The Mr 20,000 component was regarded as troponin C according to the Ca2+-binding properties, which was found to bind 0.7 mol of Ca2+/mol at 0.1 mM Ca2+. The association constant of Ca2+ to troponin C was estimated to be 5 X 10(5) M-1, and was not affected by the addition of 2 mM MgCl2. The Mr 52,000 component appeared to be troponin I, since it inhibited, together with Akazara tropomyosin, both Mg-ATPase and superprecipitation activities of actomyosin reconstituted from rabbit myosin and actin, and the inhibition of the ATPase activity was diminished by the addition of Akazara troponin C. Finally, the Mr 40,000 component appeared to be troponin T, since it co-precipitated with actin-tropomyosin filament and was indispensable with Akazara troponin C and the Mr 52,000 component (troponin I) for conferring the Ca2+ sensitivity to reconstituted actomyosin."
https://openalex.org/W1563007355,"Eukaryotic initiation factors (eIF)-4A, -4B, and -4F isolated from wheat germ were tested for their ability to catalyze ATP hydrolysis in the absence and presence of RNA. We find that eIF-4B or eIF-4F alone exhibit ATPase activity in the presence of poly(U), satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV) RNA, or globin mRNA but not in the absence of RNA. eIF-4A alone exhibits ATPase activity in the absence of RNA, but this activity is not stimulated by the addition of RNA. eIF-4A does, however, enhance RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis in the presence of either eIF-4B or eIF-4F. The RNA-dependent ATPase activities of eIF-4B and eIF-4F are additive, not synergistic. At saturating concentrations of eIF-4F, little or no stimulation of ATP hydrolysis is obtained upon the addition of eIF-4B and at saturating concentrations of eIF-4B little or no stimulation is obtained upon the addition of eIF-4F. This observation is in agreement with our previous finding (Lax, S., Fritz, W., Browning, K., and Ravel, J. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 330-333) that initiation of polypeptide synthesis is obtained in vitro with either eIF-4F or eIF-4B."
https://openalex.org/W1495756611,"Two interconvertible kinetic modes are described for ATP synthesis by bovine heart submitochondrial particles. One mode is characterized by low apparent Km values for ADP (6-10 microM) and Pi (less than or equal to 0.25 mM), and a limited capacity for ATP synthesis (apparent Vmax approximately 500 nmol ATP.min-1.mg of protein-1). ATP synthesis occurs predominantly in this mode when the coupled activity of the respiratory chain relative to the number of functional ATP synthase complexes is low. The second kinetic mode is characterized by high apparent Km values for ADP (50-100 microM) and Pi (approximately 2.0 mM) and a high capacity for ATP synthesis (Vmax greater than 1800 nmol ATP.min-1.mg of protein-1). This mode of ATP synthesis predominates when the available free energy relative to the number of functional ATP synthase units is high. These results suggest that energy pressure in mitochondria might regulate ATP synthesis such that at low levels of energy the ATP synthase operates economically (low substrate Km values, low turnover capacity for ATP synthesis), while at high levels of energy these kinetic constraints are relaxed (high substrate Km values, high turnover capacity for ATP synthesis). The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the cooperative-type kinetics of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis, the differential effects of a number of F0-F1 inhibitors on the rates of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis, and the controversy as to whether protonic energy in mitochondria is localized or delocalized."
https://openalex.org/W1531903893,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor has a subunit stoichiometry of alpha 2 beta gamma delta; all 5 subunits contain N-linked oligosaccharides. We investigated what role trimming of the oligosaccharides played in the post-translational processing of the subunits and assembly of the receptor by examining the receptor synthesized in the presence of an inhibitor of oligosaccharide trimming, 1-deoxynojirimycin. BC3H-1 cells express one-third fewer receptors when grown in the presence of 1-deoxynojirimycin. The receptor subunits that are expressed have decreased mobility by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating an inhibition of oligosaccharide trimming. In control cells, 40% of the translated alpha subunit acquires the capacity to bind alpha-bungarotoxin with a half-time of 40 min before assembly with the other subunits; the rest is rapidly degraded. In 1-deoxynojirimycin-treated cells approximately the same amount of alpha subunit is translated as in control cells, but that alpha subunit is degraded more rapidly, and only 25% acquires the capacity to bind alpha-bungarotoxin. From these results, we conclude that oligosaccharide processing either may aid in protecting the alpha subunit primary translation product from degradation or may be required for the conformational change or other post-translational modification(s) necessary for formation of the alpha-bungarotoxin binding form of the alpha subunit, which is then protected from proteolytic degradation. The cell surface receptor that is expressed in the presence of 1-deoxynojirimycin, however, is not altered in its affinity for cholinergic ligands. Thus, we conclude that differential N-linked oligosaccharide trimming of the 2 alpha subunits does not appear to play a part in the differences in affinities of the 2 alpha subunits for cholinergic ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1581375878,"Rat glomerular heparan sulfate (HS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) proteoglycan synthesis was studied in vitro and in vivo. Incorporation of [35S]sulfate into macromolecules was linear over 16 h in vitro, and DS was the predominant glycosaminoglycan (GAG), while HS dominated in vivo incubations. Proteoglycans were found in the bottom 2/5 (high density) CsCl gradient fractions and eluted as two overlapping peaks from DEAE-Sephacel columns. The proportion of low density 35S-glycoproteins and 35S-proteoglycans increased with time. Two high buoyant density HS proteoglycans were extracted from glomeruli and eluted in DEAE peak I. The first, HS-tIA, had an Mr of 130 X 10(3) with Mr 12.5 X 10(3) GAG chains. This proteoglycan was released from the tissue by trypsin and was partially displaced by heparin treatment. In addition, it was rapidly released into the medium of label-chase experiments after which it migrated slightly more rapidly than HS-tIA in gels, with HS chains similar in length to its tissue counterpart. The second, HS-tIB, had an Mr of 8.6 X 10(3) with little or no attached protein. This proteoglycan was characterized as intracellular as it resisted release by trypsin treatment or heparin extraction in medium and was not detected in the medium of label-chase experiments. Two tissue DS proteoglycans were characterized. The first, DS-tIA, co-purified with HS-tIA and was the predominant proteoglycan synthesized during 4-h in vitro incubations. Like HS-tIA, it was rapidly released into medium and displaced from cell surfaces or tissue ""receptors"" by heparin or trypsin treatments. A second, Sepharose CL-6B-excluded DS proteoglycan from DEAE peak II, DS-tII, accumulated in tissue over 16 h in vitro. This proteoglycan was self-associating and contained clusters of iduronic acid residues along its Mr 26 X 10(3) DS chains. It resisted extraction from the tissue with heparin, trypsin, and detergent. No DS-tII was detected in the incubation medium. Instead, medium proteoglycans eluted as single Sepharose CL-6B-included peaks. DS chains from medium proteoglycans were shorter (Mr 18 X 10(3)) and had more regularly spaced iduronic acid residues than GAGs from DS-tII. The length and sulfation patterns of DS-mII GAG were similar to GAG from DS-tIA. Thus, glomeruli rapidly synthesized and released Sepharose CL-6B-included heparin-displaceable DS and HS proteoglycans while retaining a Sepharose CL-6B-excluded self-associating DS proteoglycan and an intracellular HS."
https://openalex.org/W1588106930,"The asparagine-linked oligosaccharides on bovine lutropin (bLH) are unusual, containing GalNAc and sulfate but no galactose or sialic acid. Oligosaccharides from metabolically radiolabeled or purified bLH consist of non- (neutral), mono- (S-1), and di- (S-2) sulfated structures. We have previously shown that S-2 is a complex type oligosaccharide bearing two peripheral branches with the sequence SO4----GalNAc----GlcNAc attached to a typical Man3GlcNAc2 core (Green, E.D., van Halbeek, H., Boime, I., and Baenziger, J.U. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15623-15630). We have now characterized the S-1 oligosaccharides on bLH which, in contrast to S-2, consist of several different structures of both the hybrid and complex types. The sulfate on S-1 oligosaccharides is located exclusively within the peripheral sequence SO4----GalNAc----GlcNAc. The GalNAc bearing hybrid structures, either with or without sulfate, cannot be processed to mono- or disulfated complex oligosaccharides due to the inability of either alpha-mannosidase II or GlcNAc-transferase II to act on GalNAc containing oligosaccharides. Since both Gal and GalNAc are added to oligosaccharides on some pituitary hormones, for example bovine and ovine follitropin and human lutropin, the Gal- and GalNAc-transferases appear to be key elements in regulating the synthesis of sulfated oligosaccharides on bLH and the other pituitary glycoprotein hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1589693763,"Reversible thiol/disulfide exchange equilibria between rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase and glutathione redox buffers results in a dependence of the activity of the enzyme on the thiol to disulfide ratio of the redox buffer (Gilbert, H. F. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12086-12091). The transition between fully reduced (active) and fully oxidized (inactive) enzyme is half complete at a [GSH]/[GSSG] ratio of 6.5 +/- 1 at pH 8.0 and 5.6 +/- 0.9 at pH 7.2. In the presence of excess GSSG approximately 40-50% of the activity is lost in a rapid process (k = 110 M-1 min-1), while the remaining activity is lost more slowly (k = 1.9 M-1 min-1). Two equivalents of radiolabeled glutathione are incorporated covalently, one coincident with each phase of inactivation. The most rapidly oxidized sulfhydryl group is also the most rapidly reduced by GSH in the reverse reaction (k = 150 M-1 min-1). Reduction of a more slowly reacting protein-glutathione mixed disulfide is required to regenerate the original activity (k = 0.33 M-1 min-1). The thiol/disulfide oxidation equilibrium constant (Kox) for the most rapidly oxidized sulfhydryl group is estimated to be 0.7 while that for the more slowly oxidized group is 6.1. The sulfhydryl group which is more easily oxidized kinetically is the more thermodynamically resistant to oxidation. The magnitude of the equilibrium constants for these reversible oxidations would suggest that the oxidation state (and activity) of phosphofructokinase would not be significantly affected by typical metabolic changes in the glutathione oxidation state in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1589099107,"Glycerinated rabbit fast skeletal muscle fibers were chemically skinned with 1% Brij 35 and partially depleted of endogenous troponin C subunit (TnC) by exposure of the fibers to EDTA (Zot, H. G., and Potter, J. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7678-7683). The TnC-depleted fibers exhibited a decrease in maximal tension that was mostly restored by readdition of TnC or by the addition of the fluorescent 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl aziridine analogue, TnCDanz. TnCDanz is known to undergo an increase in fluorescence intensity when Ca2+ binds to the two low affinity Ca2+-specific regulatory sites of TnC. Steady-state fractional fluorescence and tension changes were measured simultaneously as a function of Ca2+. The Ca2+ sensitivity of the fluorescence curve was about 0.6 log unit greater than the tension curve. This difference in sensitivity could be explained if separate conformational states of TnC, brought about by Ca2+ binding to the Ca2+-specific sites, produce the fluorescence and tension changes. TnC-depleted fibers were also reconstituted with the fluorescent 2-[(4'-iodoacetamido)analino]naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid analogue, cardiac TnCIaans, which undergoes an increase in fluorescence intensity when Ca2+ binds to the single Ca2+- specific regulatory site. The steady-state fractional fluorescence and tension curves for fibers reconstituted with cardiac TnCIaans had nearly the same Ca2+ sensitivity. The steady-state fractional fluorescence of myofibrils reconstituted with TnCDanz was found to have a greater sensitivity to Ca2+ than the simultaneously measured ATPase. In all cases paired fractional fluorescence and activity curves tended to have parallel dependence on Ca2+. These procedures make it possible to study the Ca2+ binding properties of the Ca2+- specific sites in intact myofibrils and skinned fibers; the results presented suggest that the Ca2+ affinity of the Ca2+-specific sites of troponin are reduced in the thin filament compared to that of troponin in solution."
https://openalex.org/W1552725012,"An assay has been developed to measure association of brain ankyrin with protein site(s) in brain membranes that are independent of spectrin and tubulin, behave as integral membrane proteins, and appear to be similar in several respects to the erythrocyte anion channel. Brain membranes were depleted of ankyrin, spectrin, and other peripheral membrane proteins by a brief incubation in 0.1 M sodium hydroxide. Binding of ankyrin to these membranes fulfilled experimentally testable criteria for a specific protein-protein association. Binding was optimal at physiological values for ionic strength and pH, was of high affinity (Kd = 20-60 nM), and the capacity of 25 pmol/mg of brain membrane protein is in the same range as the number of spectrin tetramers (30 pmol/mg). The membrane-binding site(s) for brain ankyrin are likely to be related in some way to the cytoplasmic domain of the erythrocyte anion channel since binding was inhibited by the anion channel domain and by erythrocyte ankyrin. The binding site(s) for brain ankyrin were released from the membrane by limited proteolysis as active water-soluble fragments capable of inhibiting binding of ankyrin to membranes. Ankyrin-binding fragments of Mr = 40,000 and 68,000 were selectively bound to an erythrocyte ankyrin affinity column. The fragment of Mr = 40,000 is close to the size of the cytoplasmic domain of the erythrocyte anion channel. It is likely based on these results that membrane attachment proteins for ankyrin are present in brain and other tissues and that these membrane proteins have domains homologous at least in conformation to the ankyrin-binding site of the erythrocyte anion channel."
https://openalex.org/W1565461689,"Effects of purealin isolated from a sea sponge, Psammaplysilla purea, on the enzymatic and physiochemical properties of chicken gizzard myosin were studied. At 0.15 M KCl, 40 microM purealin increased the Ca2+- and Mg2+-ATPase activity of dephosphorylated gizzard myosin to 2.5- and 3-fold, respectively, but decreased the K+-EDTA-ATPase activity of the myosin to 0.25-fold. In contrast, purealin had little effect on the ATPase activities of phosphorylated gizzard myosin. The ATP-induced decrease in light scattering of dephosphorylated gizzard myosin at 0.15 M KCl was lessened by 40 microM purealin. Electron microscopic observations indicated that thick filaments of dephosphorylated myosin were disassembled immediately by addition of 1 mM ATP at 0.15 M KCl, although they were preserved by purealin for a long time even after addition of ATP. Upon ultracentrifugation, dephosphorylated myosin sedimented as two components, the 10 S species and myosin filaments, in the solution containing 0.18 M KCl and 1 mM Mg X ATP in the presence of 60 microM purealin. These results suggest that purealin modulates the ATPase activities of dephosphorylated gizzard myosin by enhancing the stability of myosin filaments against the disassembling action of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1588922342,"To examine the possibility of cooperative interactions between the two myosin heads in muscle contraction, Ca2+-activated force development, K+-EDTA-and Mg2+-ATPase activities, muscle fiber stiffness, and the velocity of unloaded shortening were measured on partially p-phenylenedimaleimide (p-PDM)-treated glycerinated muscle fibers, which contained a mixture of myosin molecules with zero, one, and two of their heads inactivated, and the relationships among these values (expressed relative to the control values) were studied. It was found that the magnitude of the Ca2+-activated isometric force development was proportional to the square of both K+-EDTA- and Mg2+-ATPase activities and also to the square of muscle fiber stiffness. If the two myosin heads in the glycerinated fibers are assumed to react independently with p-PDM, the above results strongly suggest that each myosin molecule in the thick filaments can generate force only when its two heads do not react with p-PDM, muscle fiber stiffness is determined by the total number of native heads, and there is no cooperative interaction between the two myosin heads in catalyzing ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2000588645,"Replication of a replicative form DNA of bacteriophage ÏX174 initiates by rolling-circle synthesis of the viral DNA followed by discontinuous synthesis of the complementary DNA. Gene C protein of ÏX174, which is involved in DNA packaging, inhibits the rolling-circle DNA synthesis by binding to the initiation complex in vitro. The gene C protein-associated initiation complex can synthesize and package the viral DNA to produce infectious phage when supplemented with ÏX174 gene J protein and the prohead. Multiple rounds of phage synthesis occur without dissociation of the gene C protein from the complex. These results indicate that gene C protein is central in the switch from replication of a replicative form DNA to synthesis and concomitant packaging of viral DNA into phage capsid, which occurs in the late stage of infection."
https://openalex.org/W1503085869,"Raman spectra have been measured of the following samples: active calcium pump protein in light sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes, lipids extracted from light SR membranes, active calcium pump protein reconstituted in dielaidoylphosphatidylcholine (DEPC), and pure DEPC. The spectra of native SR lipids and of pure DEPC are different, and yet when these spectra are subtracted from the spectra of the respective protein-lipid complexes, the resulting amide I spectra of the calcium pump protein are the same, indicating that appropriate criteria have been chosen for subtraction of the spectrum of a lipid. This spectrum has been analyzed for secondary structure with the following results. The SR calcium pump protein contains 51 +/- 5% helix, in agreement with a prediction of secondary structure obtained from an analysis of the sequence, and 21 +/- 4% beta-strand. In addition, the presence of protein broadens and lowers the main melting transition of DEPC."

https://openalex.org/W1493387528,"The effect of a lipophilic antibiotic, ionophore A23187, on the purified Ca2+-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum was investigated. When the enzyme was pretreated with A23187 in the presence and absence of Ca2+, the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity was inhibited almost completely, but the activity of the contaminating Mg2+-ATPase was unaffected. The steady state level of the phosphoenzyme (EP) from ATP or Pi was not substantially altered. When the pretreatment was performed in the presence of Ca2+, EP formation from ATP was only slightly retarded, but EP decomposition was strongly inhibited. Under these conditions, the accumulated EP was ADP-sensitive. EP formation from Pi after chelating of Ca2+ was quite slow, whereas EP once formed was in rapid equilibrium with Pi of the medium. On the other hand, when the pretreatment was performed in the absence of Ca2+, EP formation from ATP was extremely slow, but EP once formed was in rapid dynamic equilibrium with ATP of the medium. EP formation from Pi was very fast, and this EP was in rapid equilibrium with Pi of the medium. These results demonstrate that A23187 selectively inhibits isomerization of the enzyme between the high Ca2+-affinity form and the low Ca2+-affinity form in the catalytic cycle, whether or not the enzyme is phosphorylated. This suggests that interactions between the enzyme protein and the surrounding lipids could play a crucial role in this isomerization."
https://openalex.org/W1527016114,"Preincubation of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles in the presence of the calcium chelator, [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)tetraacetic acid] (EGTA), irreversibly uncouples calcium transport from ATP hydrolysis. Uncoupling cannot be explained by increased membrane permeability, but is associated with decreased capacity of the Ca2+-ATPase to bind noncatalytic, tightly bound ATP and ADP (Berman, M. C. (1982) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 694, 95-121). The effects of EGTA-induced uncoupling on absorbance and fluorescence properties of the bound ATP analog, 2'(3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP), have been studied under static and turnover conditions. Binding of 4.5-4.9 nmol of TNP-ATP/mg, as determined by absorbance difference titration, was relatively unaffected in the uncoupled state. TNP-ATP, bound to coupled vesicles during turnover, showed 6-8-fold enhanced fluorescence and a shift in the difference absorbance maximum from 510 to 493 nm, indicating increased hydrophobicity of the noncatalytic site. Turnover-dependent fluorescence enhancement was diminished by 60-70% in the uncoupled state, while the absorbance maximum wavelength shift was abolished. These data, correlating changes in the environment of the noncatalytic or regulatory nucleotide binding site on the Ca2+-ATPase with coupling activity, indicate that uncoupling is an intramolecular process, involving a ligand binding site on the ATPase, and that exclusion of H2O from the site occupied by noncatalytic nucleotides, during at least part of the catalytic cycle, is an event associated with energy transduction."

In all cases, an enzyme-dependent and substrate-specific oxidation to alpha-NAD+ is observed with the stereochemistry of oxidation identical with that found for the oxidation of the correspondingly labeled beta-NADH. The ability of dehydrogenases from diverse sources to utilize alpha-NADH in a stereochemically competent fashion is discussed in relation to proposed interactions between the nicotinamide sugar moiety and active site residues or obligatory alignments of the pyridine and sugar moieties."
https://openalex.org/W1493149317,"The ATPase activity of native dynein 1 from sea urchin sperm flagella is activated reversibly by inorganic monovalent chlorides with the magnitude of activation being nearly independent of the cation below 0.3 M. At higher concentrations, activation increases in the order LiCl greater than NH4Cl greater than NaCl greater than KCl, with the maximum occurring at about 0.8 M in all cases. The sodium halides activate reversibly in the order NaI greater than NaBr greater than NaCl, but NaF is strongly inhibitory. The presence of the organic anions formate, acetate, or propionate favors the native low ATPase activity state, with lithium acetate giving little activation at up to 1 M and sodium acetate partially reversing the activation due to simultaneous presence of 0.6 M NaCl. The sedimentation rate of the dynein does not change between 0.2 and 0.8 M NaCl or sodium acetate, suggesting that the effects of the anions on ATPase activity are due to local changes near the catalytic site, rather than to large-scale changes in the molecular structure. All the agents that activate the dynein ATPase, either reversibly (halides) or irreversibly (Triton X-100), decrease its sensitivity to inhibition by vanadate, consistent with ATPase activation being the result of a decreased stability of the dynein. ADP.Pi kinetic intermediate that is thought to bind vanadate at the gamma-Pi site and act as a dead-end kinetic block. Although many divalent cations, including Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, and Sr2+, can support dynein ATPase activity, the magnitude of ATPase increase observed upon treatment with Triton X-100 is greatest with Mg2+ and Mn2+, which are also the only cations capable of supporting the motility of demembranated flagella at rates similar to those observed in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W95140266,"An altered form of the elongation factor 3 (EF-3) has been purified to near homogeneity from a thermolabile yeast mutant ts 13-06. The isolation procedure involved chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex, CM-Sepharose, and hydroxylapatite columns. The final purification of this protein was obtained by affinity chromatography on an ATP-Sepharose column. Because of the extreme lability of the mutant protein, the yield was very poor. Silver stain analysis of the sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoretograms indicated that the affinity-purified protein was better than 90% pure. From the studies of the physical and biochemical properties, the following characteristics of the purified wild type and the mutant protein have been established. The two proteins were indistinguishable by their molecular weight, amino acid composition, and isoelectric point. Purified mutant EF-3 was rapidly inactivated between 37 and 39 degrees C. Under this condition, wild type EF-3 was completely stable. Ribosome-dependent GTPase and ATPase activities of the mutant EF-3 were heat sensitive; GTPase activity was more labile than the ATPase activity. Mutant EF-3, after exposure to a nonpermissive temperature, failed to stimulate binding of the ternary complex of EF-1 X GTP X aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosome. The wild type protein was fully active under this condition. Other biochemical and physical properties of these two proteins are under current investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1528575631,"Rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen debranching enzyme is inactivated in a kinetically biphasic manner by GSSG at pH 8.0. The rapid phase results in the loss of 30% activity, while the slower phase leads to total enzyme inactivation. Both the glucosidase and the transferase activities of the enzyme are inhibited by GSSG. The inactivation by disulfides is fully and rapidly reversed in a biphasic manner by reduction with excess reduced dithiothreitol or GSH. After a fast initial recovery of 70% of the initial activity, the remaining 30% of the activity is recovered more slowly. Equilibration of the enzyme with a redox buffer of GSH and GSSG shows a monophasic equilibration of the activity. The ratio of GSH/GSSG where the enzyme is 50% active (R0.5) is 0.06 +/- 0.03. The R0.5 does not vary significantly with the total concentration of glutathione species suggesting formation of protein-SSG mixed disulfides. The ratios of the observed second-order rate constants for GSSG inactivation and GSH reactivation do not lead to a correct value of the observed thiol/disulfide oxidation equilibrium constant. Although the enzyme has sulfhydryl groups, the oxidation of which leads to activity changes, the kinetic and thermodynamic resistance to oxidation suggests that the enzyme is not likely to be subject to regulation by thiol/disulfide exchange in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1588922811,"The presence of low concentrations of methanol or isopropyl alcohol (2-5%, v/v) in the assay medium stabilizes the latency of dynein 1 from sea urchin sperm flagella, with about a 50% decrease in ATPase level compared to that in the absence of solvent. Somewhat higher concentrations (10-20%, v/v) of these solvents in the assay give a 5-10-fold activation of ATPase activity. Dioxane, formamide, and dimethylformamide, on the other hand, always activate the ATPase activity, with a 5-10-fold increase observed at about 15% (v/v). The activation of latent ATPase activity by solvents is reversible for short exposures, especially in the presence of ATP and at low temperature, but the activation becomes irreversible upon more prolonged exposure. The rate constant for irreversible activation by 16% methanol at 21 degrees C is 0.08 min-1, compared to rates of 0.44 and 0.02 min-1 for activation by 0.05% Triton X-100 at 21 and 0 degree C, respectively. The slowness of this reversible activation induced by methanol and by Triton X-100 suggests that it is the result of large-scale conformational changes in the structure of the dynein. However, the activation by methanol occurs without the dissociation of the alpha and beta subunits of dynein that is observed with Triton X-100. The presence of 1 mM MgATP, or of 100 microM MgATP and 10 microM vanadate substantially protects latent dynein from activation by 0.05% Triton X-100."

https://openalex.org/W21533465,"Treatment of the multifunctional alpha 2 beta 2 anthranilate synthase complex of Neurospora crassa with elastase produced two fragments of the complex, one possessing anthranilate synthase activity and the other having both indole-3-glycerol phosphate (InGP) synthase and N-(5'-phosphoribosyl)anthranilate (PRA) isomerase activities. Sequencing the NH2 terminus of the InGP synthase-PRA isomerase fragment revealed that cleavage was between positions 237 and 238 of the beta-subunit within a segment of the polypeptide chain which links the glutamine-binding (G) domain with the InGP synthase-PRA isomerase domains. The fragment containing anthranilate synthase activity has a molecular weight of 98,000, as estimated by gel filtration, and is composed of an apparently intact alpha-subunit (70 kDa) associated with the G-domain fragment (29 kDa) derived from the beta-subunit. The alpha X G-domain complex was resistant to further degradation by elastase. When either the alpha 2 beta 2 complex or the alpha X G-domain complex was incubated with trypsin, the alpha-subunit was degraded to a 66-kDa alpha-fragment with reduced enzymatic activity, which was resistant to further cleavage. In contrast, incubation of alpha-subunit alone with either elastase or trypsin resulted in its complete degradation, indicating that association of the alpha-subunit with either G-domain or beta-subunit protected the alpha-subunit from this extensive degradation. A model for the anthranilate synthase complex is proposed in which the trifunctional beta-subunit forms a dimer by the self-association of the InGP synthase-PRA isomerase domains; the G-domain is connected to the InGP synthase-PRA isomerase domain by a relatively disordered region of the peptide chain which, in the alpha 2 beta 2 complex, remains susceptible to proteases; and neither alpha-subunit nor G-domain significantly self-associates."

The specific antibody was purified further by immunoaffinity chromatography on a phosphofructokinase-conjugated affinity column. Intermediate catabolic products of phosphofructokinase were extracted from fresh pig livers under conditions of inhibition of proteinases, concentrated by chromatography on an anti-phosphofructokinase IgG-conjugated affinity column, and purified by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Their cross-reactivities to the purified phosphofructokinase were assessed by an immunoelectrotransfer blot method. The intact form of phosphofructokinase in pig liver was demonstrated as the major spot of 84 kDa on the blot. Polypeptides of 68, 64, 56, and 51 kDa showed apparent cross-reactivities to phosphofructokinase. The structural homology among them was confirmed by proteinase V8 digestion followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The possibility of artifacts in preparation was ruled out by an internal tracer method. Thus, it is concluded that the predominant isozyme of phosphofructokinase in pig liver (84 kDa) is in vivo degraded via intermediate catabolic products of 68, 64, 56, and 51 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W1500881272,"In previous work, we (El-Saleh, S., Theiret, R., Johnson, P., and Potter, J. D. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 11014-11021) presented evidence that Ca2+ activation of skeletal myofilaments depends on a specific actin domain. We showed that rabbit skeletal thin filaments reconstituted with actin modified at Lys-237 activate heavy meromyosin X Mg2+-ATPase activity independently of the Ca2+ ion concentration. The modification, which apparently blocks the inhibitory effects of troponin-tropomyosin (Tn X Tm), on acto-heavy meromyosin X Mg2+-ATPase activity, consisted of conversion of Lys-237 to an enamine by reaction of purified actin with 2,4-pentanedione (PD). In experiments reported here, we have treated myofibrils with PD with the idea of altering actin in its native state within the myofilament lattice. Preparations of native and Tn X Tm free (desensitized) myofibrils were incubated with PD (100 mol/mol of actin lysine) under rigorous conditions (10 mM 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, pH 7.0, 2.0 nM [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid, 0.4 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.15 mM NaN3). Actin isolated from PD X myofibrils contained 0.5 mol of enamine/mol. In the presence of Ca2+, the Mg2+-ATPase activity of PD-treated myofibrils was 110-120% of the maximum Ca2+-stimulated Mg2+-ATPase activity of untreated control myofibrils. In low free Ca2+ (pCa greater than 8), the Mg2+-ATPase activity of the PD-treated myofibrils was not suppressed and remained at 100-106% of the maximum activity of the control myofibrils. Ca2+ sensitivity of the PD-treated myofibrils was restored following treatment with hydroxylamine, which hydrolyzes enamine's products. Preparations of desensitized myofibrils reconstituted with PD-modified or unmodified Tn X Tm demonstrated the same Ca2+-sensitive ATPase activities. On the other hand, preparations reconstituted with unmodified or PD-modified Tn X Tm and PD-modified desensitized myofibrils were insensitive to Ca2+ ion concentration. The Mg2+-ATPase activity of preparations of myosin treated with PD was not activated by modified or unmodified actin. Our results indicate that is is possible to produce an active state(s) of the myofibrils in the absence and presence of Ca2+ by specific alteration of the actin X Tm interaction following modification of myofibrillar actin most likely at Lys-237."
