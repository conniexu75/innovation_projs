https://openalex.org/W3028644610,"In many areas of oncology, we lack sensitive tools to track low-burden disease. Although cell-free DNA (cfDNA) shows promise in detecting cancer mutations, we found that the combination of low tumor fraction (TF) and limited number of DNA fragments restricts low-disease-burden monitoring through the prevailing deep targeted sequencing paradigm. We reasoned that breadth may supplant depth of sequencing to overcome the barrier of cfDNA abundance. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of cfDNA allowed ultra-sensitive detection, capitalizing on the cumulative signal of thousands of somatic mutations observed in solid malignancies, with TF detection sensitivity as low as 10-5. The WGS approach enabled dynamic tumor burden tracking and postoperative residual disease detection, associated with adverse outcome. Thus, we present an orthogonal framework for cfDNA cancer monitoring via genome-wide mutational integration, enabling ultra-sensitive detection, overcoming the limitation of cfDNA abundance and empowering treatment optimization in low-disease-burden oncology care."
https://openalex.org/W3032166296,"Neutralizing antibodies to adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are highly prevalent in humans1,2, and block liver transduction3–5 and vector readministration6; thus, they represent a major limitation to in vivo gene therapy. Strategies aimed at overcoming anti-AAV antibodies are being studied7, which often involve immunosuppression and are not efficient in removing pre-existing antibodies. Imlifidase (IdeS) is an endopeptidase able to degrade circulating IgG that is currently being tested in transplant patients8. Here, we studied if IdeS could eliminate anti-AAV antibodies in the context of gene therapy. We showed efficient cleavage of pooled human IgG (intravenous Ig) in vitro upon endopeptidase treatment. In mice passively immunized with intravenous Ig, IdeS administration decreased anti-AAV antibodies and enabled efficient liver gene transfer. The approach was scaled up to nonhuman primates, a natural host for wild-type AAV. IdeS treatment before AAV vector infusion was safe and resulted in enhanced liver transduction, even in the setting of vector readministration. Finally, IdeS reduced anti-AAV antibody levels from human plasma samples in vitro, including plasma from prospective gene therapy trial participants. These results provide a potential solution to overcome pre-existing antibodies to AAV-based gene therapy. An IgG-cleaving endopeptidase can degrade circulating anti-adeno-associated virus antibodies in mice and nonhuman primates in vivo, as well as in human plasma in vitro, offering a potential solution for a major hurdle in gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3030039762,"The mucosal epithelium is a common target of damage by chronic bacterial infections and the accompanying toxins, and most cancers originate from this tissue. We investigated whether colibactin, a potent genotoxin1 associated with certain strains of Escherichia coli2, creates a specific DNA-damage signature in infected human colorectal cells. Notably, the genomic contexts of colibactin-induced DNA double-strand breaks were enriched for an AT-rich hexameric sequence motif, associated with distinct DNA-shape characteristics. A survey of somatic mutations at colibactin target sites of several thousand cancer genomes revealed notable enrichment of this motif in colorectal cancers. Moreover, the exact double-strand-break loci corresponded with mutational hot spots in cancer genomes, reminiscent of a trinucleotide signature previously identified in healthy colorectal epithelial cells3. The present study provides evidence for the etiological role of colibactin in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3031036292,"In metastatic cancer, the degree of heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its molecular underpinnings remain largely unstudied. To characterize the tumor–immune interface at baseline and during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), we performed immunogenomic analysis of treatment-naive and paired samples from before and after treatment with chemotherapy. In treatment-naive HGSOC, we found that immune-cell-excluded and inflammatory microenvironments coexist within the same individuals and within the same tumor sites, indicating ubiquitous variability in immune cell infiltration. Analysis of TME cell composition, DNA copy number, mutations and gene expression showed that immune cell exclusion was associated with amplification of Myc target genes and increased expression of canonical Wnt signaling in treatment-naive HGSOC. Following NACT, increased natural killer (NK) cell infiltration and oligoclonal expansion of T cells were detected. We demonstrate that the tumor–immune microenvironment of advanced HGSOC is intrinsically heterogeneous and that chemotherapy induces local immune activation, suggesting that chemotherapy can potentiate the immunogenicity of immune-excluded HGSOC tumors. Immunogenomic analyses of advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer samples before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy show that the tumor–immune microenvironment is intrinsically heterogeneous and that chemotherapy induces local immune activation."

https://openalex.org/W3030331522,"The Mediator complex directs signals from DNA-binding transcription factors to RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Despite this pivotal position, mechanistic understanding of Mediator in human cells remains incomplete. Here we quantified Mediator-controlled Pol II kinetics by coupling rapid subunit degradation with orthogonal experimental readouts. In agreement with a model of condensate-driven transcription initiation, large clusters of hypophosphorylated Pol II rapidly disassembled upon Mediator degradation. This was accompanied by a selective and pronounced disruption of cell-type-specifying transcriptional circuits, whose constituent genes featured exceptionally high rates of Pol II turnover. Notably, the transcriptional output of most other genes was largely unaffected by acute Mediator ablation. Maintenance of transcriptional activity at these genes was linked to an unexpected CDK9-dependent compensatory feedback loop that elevated Pol II pause release rates across the genome. Collectively, our work positions human Mediator as a globally acting coactivator that selectively safeguards the functionality of cell-type-specifying transcriptional networks."

https://openalex.org/W3029257300,"Many women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) report high depression rates. The relationship between PCOS and these high depression rates is unclear. Two-component lifestyle interventions have revealed short-term effects on depression scores in this group of women. In general, 3-component interventions including diet, exercise, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are more effective in the long-term to improve emotional well-being. This has not yet been studied in women with PCOS. This study examined the effect of 20 CBT lifestyle (LS) sessions combined with a healthy diet and physical therapy with or without 9 months additional feedback through Short Message Service (SMS) via mobile phone, compared to care as usual (CAU, involving advice to lose weight). In this secondary analysis, 155 women with PCOS and a BMI above 25 kg/m2 were eligible. Depression scores decreased significantly in the LS programme compared to CAU (P = 0.045). In both the LS programme without SMS (P = 0.036) and the LS programme with SMS (P = 0.011) depression scores decreased while no change was observed in CAU (P = 0.875). Self-esteem scores improved significantly in the LS programme compared to CAU (P = 0.027). No differences in body image scores were observed in LS participants compared to CAU (P = 0.087), although body image improved significantly in both the LS without SMS (P = 0.001) and with SMS (P = 0.008) study arms. We found no significant mediating role by androgens in the relationship between LS participants and emotional well-being. Only weight-loss mediated the relationship between LS and self-esteem. To conclude, a three-component lifestyle intervention programme with or without additional SMS resulted in significant improvements in depression and self-esteem compared to CAU, in women with PCOS, obesity, and a wish to achieve a pregnancy. Testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA, insulin, HOMA-IR, and cortisol did not mediate this effect. Weight loss mediated the effects on self-esteem but not on depression and body-image. This suggests that lifestyle treatment independent of weight loss can reduce depression and body-image, but both lifestyle treatment and weight loss can improve self-esteem. Thus, a three-component lifestyle intervention based on CBT could prove successful in improving mood in women with PCOS who are overweight or obese and attempting to become pregnant."

This paper then makes a spatial and temporal analysis of the coupling coordination relationship among the dimensions of sustainable higher education development by using the coupling coordination model. In addition, this paper proposes specific and applicable countermeasures for sustainable higher education development. The results show that the comprehensive degrees of sustainable higher education development in most regions are not high, and the coastal regions and the Central-south China regions have higher grades; in addition, for most regions, the coupling coordination degrees mainly remain stable, with mild growth in the respective classifications, and the gap between the west and other regions is declining. The improved method is applicable to measure the sustainable development of higher education and to propose detailed and appropriate suggestions for further development."
https://openalex.org/W3029267962,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are essential for maintenance of lineage fidelity by coordinating developmental gene expression programs. Polycomb group ring finger 6 (PCGF6) has been previously reported to repress expression of lineage-specific genes, especially germ cell–related genes in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) via the noncanonical polycomb repressive complex PRC1.6. However, the molecular mechanism of this repression remains largely unknown. Here, using RNA-Seq, real-time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, immunoprecipitation, and ChIP analyses, we demonstrate that PCGF6 plays an essential role in embryonic development, indicated by the partially penetrant embryonic lethality in homozygous PCGF6 (Pcgf6−/−)-deficient mice. We also found that surviving Pcgf6-deficient mice exhibit reduced fertility. Using the Pcgf6-deficient mice, we observed that ablation of Pcgf6 in somatic tissues robustly derepresses germ cell–related genes. We further provide evidence that these genes are direct targets of PCGF6 in ESCs and that endogenous PCGF6 co-localizes with the histone-modifying proteins G9A histone methyltransferase (G9A)/G9a-like protein (GLP) and histone deacetylase 1/2 (HDAC1/2) on the promoters of the germ cell–related genes. Moreover, the binding of these proteins to their target genes correlated with methylation of Lys-9 of histone 3 and with the status of histone acetylation at these genes. Moreover, the recruitment of G9A/GLP and HDAC1/2 to target promoters depended on the binding of PCGF6.

Of interest, the expression of germ cell–specific genes is globally repressed in ESCs and all somatic cells in the body. Failure to appropriately express these genes in meiotic cells often results in a partial or complete loss of fertility (14Matzuk M.M. Lamb D.J. Genetic dissection of mammalian fertility pathways.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4 (12479614): s41-s4910.1038/ncb-nm-fertilityS41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas illegitimate expression in somatic cells may lead to catastrophic consequences such as oncogenic transformation (15Simpson A.J.

Cancer. 2005; 5 (16034368): 615-62510.1038/nrc1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms that govern Pcgf6-mediated timely silencing of the germline-specific genes remain poorly understood. Intriguingly, the association of Pcgf6 with G9a/Glp (7Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. A complex with chromatin modifiers that occupies E2F- and Myc-responsive genes in G0 cells.Science. 2002; 296 (12004135): 1132-113610.1126/science.1069861Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), with major euchromatic H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 HKMTs (histone lysine methyltransferases), and with the histone deacetylase Hdac1/2 suggests that epigenetic modulations could play a role in silencing of germ line–expressed genes (8Qin J. Whyte W.A. Anderssen E. Apostolou E. Chen H.H. Akbarian S. Bronson R.T. Hochedlinger K. Ramaswamy S. Young R.A. Hock H. The polycomb group protein L3mbtl2 assembles an atypical PRC1-family complex that is essential in pluripotent stem cells and early development.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11 (22770845): 319-33210.1016/j.stem.2012.06.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, this issue has not been addressed experimentally. In this study, we showed that disruption of the Pcgf6 gene led to partial embryonic lethality, and mutant male and female mice exhibited significantly impaired fertility. In the surviving Pcgf6-deficient mice, Pcgf6 was found to be essential for silencing germ cell–specific genes in somatic tissues, thereby suppressing the germ cell differentiation program. Furthermore, G9a/Glp and Hdac1/2 existed in a repressive complex assembled by Pcgf6. Pcgf6 directly bound to its silenced genes, and its binding highly correlated with G9a/Glp and Hdac1/2 in ESCs. Moreover, deletion of the Pcgf6 gene induced robust reduction of H3K9me1/2, accompanied with derepression of germ cell–specific genes. Our data genetically demonstrate mechanistic insight into how Pcgf6 acts as a dedicated repressor of genes associated with meiosis and germ cells, thereby preserving the identity of ESCs as well as somatic cells under physiological conditions. To uncover the biological role of Pcgf6 in vivo, we generated mice with targeted disruption of the Pcgf6 locus (Fig. 1A). The conserved RING motif is located in exon 3 of the Pcgf6 gene (16Akasaka T. Takahashi N. Suzuki M. Koseki H. Bodmer R. Koga H. MBLR, a new RING finger protein resembling mammalian Polycomb gene products, is regulated by cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation.Genes Cells. 2002; 7 (12167161): 835-85010.1046/j.1365-2443.2002.00565.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); therefore, we designed a conditional targeting construct spanning 2 kb to disrupt exons 2, 3, 4, and 5. A loxP site (3′loxP) was cloned downstream of exon 5, and a PGKneo cassette flanked by FRT sites was cloned upstream of exon 2. The linearized targeting vector was introduced into C57BL/6J ESCs by electroporation, and cells were selected with G418. 96 G418-resistant ESC colonies were selected and screened for a recombination event using long-range PCR. The FRT-flanked Neo selection cassette was removed by subsequent FLPe-mediated recombination. Two ESC clones carrying one floxed Pcgf6 allele were microinjected into C57BL/6J blastocysts to generate chimeric animals. Both ESC clones successfully transmitted the Pcgf6-flox conditional allele through the germline. These mice were mated with a mouse strain that expresses Cre recombinase ubiquitously under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Deletion of exons 2–5 of the Pcgf6 gene was confirmed by PCR analysis (Fig. 1B). Successful gene ablation of Pcgf6 in homozygous Pcgf6 (Pcgf6–/–)-deficient mice was also confirmed by the absence of its protein product in multiple tissues by Western blotting analyses (Fig. 1C). Heterozygous Pcgf6 mice were viable, fertile, and indistinguishable from WT littermates. When heterozygotes were intercrossed, we observed a significantly lower fraction of Pcgf6 homozygous mutant offspring than the 25% predicted by the Mendelian law (Fig. 1D), which is consistent with previous results (12Endoh M. Endo T.A. Shinga J. Hayashi K. Farcas A. Ma K.W. Ito S. Sharif J. Endoh T. Onaga N. Nakayama M. Ishikura T. Masui O. Kessler B.M.

Additionally, surviving homozygotes appeared smaller in body size and lighter in weight than their WT or heterozygous littermates at the same age (Fig. 1, E and F). Notably, ablation of Pcgf6 did not affect the protein levels of other components of the PRC1.6 complex (Fig. 1C). qRT-PCR showed broad expression of Pcgf6 mRNA in various tissues of WT mice, among which the highest level of expression was detected in testis (Figs. S1 and S2A). Moreover, recent research has demonstrated that ablation of the genes encoding the unique subunits of PRC1.6 in ESCs is accompanied with robust derepression of germline-specific gene expression (8Qin J.

Thus, the unique expression patterns of Pcgf6 prompted us to explore its potential regulation of reproduction and fertility in mice. When Pcgf6+/– males and females were crossed with their WT counterparts, the litter sizes (7.1 and 6.7 pups/litter, respectively) were slightly smaller than that after intercrossing the WT male and female mice (8.2 ± 1.2 pups) (Fig. 1G); however, crosses of Pcgf6–/– males and females with WT counterparts produced significantly smaller litters than did the controls (5.8 and 4.5 pups, respectively). It was noteworthy that mating of Pcgf6–/– mice produced an average litter size of only 1.7 pups (Fig. 1G). These data indicated that loss of Pcgf6 in both male and female mice caused a reduction in fecundity. To evaluate fertility in the male Pcgf6 null mice, testicular development and morphology were analyzed. At 8 weeks postpartum, testes and epididymis from male Pcgf6–/– were smaller than those from WT littermates (Fig. 2A). When testes and epididymis weights were normalized to body weight, the ratios were significantly reduced in Pcgf6−/− mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 2B), suggesting an impairment of testicular function and/or spermatogenesis. Histological analysis of the testes by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining indicated that there were no significant alterations in the interstitial spaces or seminiferous epithelium of testes from Pcgf6−/− mice (Fig. 2C). Meanwhile, as observed with the testis, H&E staining did not reveal any significant morphological differences in the ovaries of adult Pcgf6−/− mice compared with WT littermates (Fig. S2). However, compared with WT mice, Pcgf6−/− mice exhibited significant reductions in sperm motility, accompanied by more morphologically abnormal sperm than exhibited by WT littermates (Fig. 2, D–F). To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed phenotypic changes, we performed RNA-Seq on whole testes from Pcgf6–/– mice and their respective control. In Pcgf6–/– testes, 150 genes were deregulated (with 65 up-regulated and 85 down-regulated) on a -fold change cutoff of 2 and p value <0.05 (Fig. 2G and Table S3). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of down-regulated target genes scored them as being strongly related to sperm motility and differentiation (Fig. 2H), suggesting a particular role for Pcgf6 in sperm fate specification. In contrast, GO analysis of up-regulated genes did not show significant association with any biological process. Importantly, among down-regulated genes, our analysis revealed a set of genes, including Adam7, Crisp1, Rnase9, Spinkl, Spink8, Spink10, and Ceacam10 (Fig. 2I), which have been shown to have critical roles in testicular development and function (19Choi H.

Spermatogenesis and fertility depend upon functional interactions between germ cells and somatic cells (Leydig and Sertoli cells). To have a more in-depth understanding of Pcgf6 in spermatogenetic events, we isolated multiple testicular cell populations (Sertoli, Leydig, and several spermatogenic cell populations) from testes. Interestingly, although Pcgf6 was expressed in Leydig and Sertoli cells, as well as in all types of germ cells of mouse testis, loss of the Pcgf6 gene affected its target gene expression (such as Crisp1, Rnase9, and Spinkl) in germ cells at the round and elongating spermatid stage but not in somatic cells or pachytene spermatocytes, raising the possibility that Pcgf6 functions in a stage-dependent manner during spermatogenesis (Fig. S3). Together, our studies suggest a previously unknown role for Pcgf6 in testicular development and spermatogenesis. Given that genetic ablation of Pcgf6 in ESCs results in illegitimate expression of germ cell– and meiosis–related genes, we wondered whether Pcgf6 is functionally required for the silencing of germline genes in somatic tissues (10Zhao W. Tong H. Huang Y. Yan Y. Teng H. Xia Y. Jiang Q. Qin J. Essential role for polycomb group protein Pcgf6 in embryonic stem cell maintenance and a noncanonical polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) integrity.J. Biol.

To this end, we compared the expression profiles of liver and brain (organs that show the high Pcgf6 mRNA expression levels (Fig. S1)) from Pcgf6 knockout and littermate WT control mice by RNA-Seq analysis. A total of 160 versus 61 genes were considerably up-regulated in Pcgf6-deficient liver and brain, respectively, and 50 versus 56 down-regulated genes in Pcgf6-deficient liver and brain, respectively, compared with their corresponding controls (Fig. 3 (A and C) and Tables S4 and S5). To gain insight into the physiological functions of Pcgf6-mediated gene regulation in somatic tissues, we performed gene ontology (GO) analyses, which revealed that the up-regulated genes are significantly enriched in germ cell– and meiosis–related functions (Fig. 3B). Strikingly, analysis of genes commonly up-regulated in Pcgf6-deficient liver and brain revealed highly significant overlap between the two RNA-Seq datasets, and GO analysis of these overlapping genes again demonstrated a strong enrichment of terms involved in meiosis and germ cell development (Fig. 3, C and D). By contrast, no significant association to any pathways or biological processes was identified in the down-regulated gene group. Together, these data revealed a previously unappreciated function of Pcgf6 for suppressing genes associated with germ cells and meiosis in cell types other than ESCs. Interestingly, we examined the proximal promoter regions of 41 up-regulated germ cell–specific genes and found specific enrichment of the binding motifs for E2f6/Dp1 (GCGGGAA) (26Gaubatz S. Wood J.G. Livingston D.M. Unusual proliferation arrest and transcriptional control properties of a newly discovered E2F family member, E2F-6.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95 (9689056): 9190-919510.1073/pnas.95.16.9190Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and Mga/Max (the E-box, CACGTG) (27Hurlin P.J. Steingrìmsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Eisenman R.N. Mga, a dual-specificity transcription factor that interacts with Max and contains a T-domain DNA-binding motif.EMBO J. 1999; 18 (10601024): 7019-702810.1093/emboj/18.24.7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, E and F). The presence of centrally enriched E-box and E2f6/Dp1 motifs in these germ cell promoters suggests that Pcgf6 represses germ cell gene expression in the context of a PRC1.6 complex. To build on this observation, we next chose to focus our efforts on the set of germline-specific genes showing aberrant expression in adult somatic tissues derived from Pcgf6 null mice. qRT-PCR analysis of Ddx4, Luzp4, Mael, Syce1, Slc25a31, Rbm46, Tex11, and Xlr4c mRNA confirmed that expression of these genes was undetectable in WT somatic tissues, whereas they were derepressed in liver and brain but also in all of the tissues we tested derived from Pcgf6 null adult mice (Fig. 4). From these results, we concluded that Pcgf6 is primarily involved in suppression of the germ cell lineage differentiation program in somatic cells and tissues. Because Pcgf6 is highly expressed in ESCs and contributes to the repression of germline genes in somatic cells, we postulated that Pcgf6 may be required for somatic cell reprogramming. To explore this possibility, we reprogrammed mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from the Pcgf6−/− mice using the classical Yamanaka’s method (28Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126 (16904174): 663-67610.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16935) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. S4, Pcgf6 deficiency in MEFs dramatically reduced the formation of alkaline phosphatase–positive colonies in Oct4-, Sox2-, Klf4-, and c-Myc (OSKM)-driven reprogramming. Importantly, reprogramming efficiency of Pcgf6−/− MEFs could be rescued by transduction of Pcgf6 (Fig. S4). The requirement for Pcgf6 in somatic cell reprogramming was also reported in recent studies using an shRNA-mediated knockdown approach (11Zdzieblo D. Li X. Lin Q. Zenke M. Illich D.J. Becker M. Müller A.M. Pcgf6, a polycomb group protein, regulates mesodermal lineage differentiation in murine ESCs and functions in iPS reprogramming.Stem Cells. 2014; 32 (25187489): 3112-312510.1002/stem.1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies reveal that Pcgf6 is specifically implicated in somatic cell reprogramming. Promoter CpG island DNA methylation is generally associated with gene silencing (29Fuks F.

However, the actual endometrial virulence profile of E. coli is poorly understood. The present study aims to characterize the phylogenetic structure and virulence potential of native vaginal populations of E. coli from healthy heifers (H), and cows with postpartum uterine diseases (PUD), such as metritis/endometritis (MT) or repeat breeder cows (RB). To this end, the virulence repertoire of 97 E. coli isolates was genotypically and phenotypically assessed. Most of them were assigned to phylogenetic group A (74%), followed by B1 (17%) and D (9%); RB strains were significantly (p < 0.05) more represented by B1. Seven of the 15 evaluated virulence genes (VFG) were detected and the most prevalent were fimH (87%), agn43 (41%) and csgA (35%); while traT (27%), fyuA (11%), hlyA (5%) and kpsMT II (5%) were observed in a lower proportion. Particularly, fyuA was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in MT cows whereas csgA showed the same behavior in PUD animals (p < 0.05). When comparing H and PUD strains, these last ones were associated to positive expression of biofilm, fimbriae curli/cellulose and motility; yet RB strains did not show motility. Vaginal B1 E. coli populations, that possess VFG (fyuA and csgA) as well as the expression of motility, curli fimbriae/cellulose and biofilm, may represent risk factors for endometrial disorders; specifically, those that also, have kpsMT II may have a pathogenic potential for causing the RB syndrome. Future research focusing on the detection of these strains in the vaginal microbiota of cows with postpartum uterine diseases should be done since the control of their presence in vagina could reduce the risk that they access the uterus during the postpartum period."

Its high intake has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including hypertension (HTN) and hyperlipidaemia (HLP). Despite being physically active, the Maasai at Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) depend heavily on animals' products as their staple food with fewer intakes of vegetables or fruits due to restriction from carrying out agricultural activities within the NCA. This study aimed at determining the prevalence of HTN and HLP and their association with red meat consumption among adult Maasai of NCA.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in October 2018 using multistage sampling technique. Eight hundred and ninety-four (894) participants enrolled from seven villages in three wards within NCA Data were collected using a modified WHO NCDs-STEPS tool. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure (BP) measurements, and blood samples for glucose and cholesterol tests were obtained from the study participants. Crude and adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) for factors associated with HTN and HLP were estimated using Ordinal and Bayesian logistic regression models, respectively.The prevalence of HLP was 23.7 percent. The levels were higher among males than were among the females (29.0% vs. 20.1%, p = 0.002). The prevalence of HTN and pre-HTN (elevated BP) were 9.8 and 37.0 percent, respectively. Both HTN and elevated BP were higher among males than were among females (hypertensive [10.9% vs. 9.0%]; elevated BP [44.0% vs. 32.1%], p<0.001). The prevalence of HLP was significantly associated with level II (PR = 1.56, 95%CrI: 1.10-2.09) and level III (PR = 1.64, 95%CrI: 1.08-2.41) of red meat consumption as opposed to level I.The prevalence of hyperlipidaemia and elevated BP were high among NCA Maasai. We found a significant association between red meat consumption and hyperlipidaemia. Further follow-up studies are warranted to establish a temporal relationship between red meat consumption and both conditions."

Epidemiological evidence suggests that unsaturated fatty acids improve cardiovascular health. Here, using quantitative RT-PCR, histological analyses, magnetic cell sorting and flow cytometry assays, and MS-based lipidomics, we show that the activity of a lipid-metabolizing enzyme, secreted phospholipase A2 group V (sPLA2-V), protects against aortic dissection by endogenously mobilizing vasoprotective lipids. Global and endothelial cell–specific sPLA2-V–deficient mice frequently developed aortic dissection shortly after infusion of angiotensin II (AT-II). We observed that in the AT-II–treated aorta, endothelial sPLA2-V mobilized oleic and linoleic acids, which attenuated endoplasmic reticulum stress, increased the expression of lysyl oxidase, and thereby stabilized the extracellular matrix in the aorta. Of note, dietary supplementation with oleic or linoleic acid reversed the increased susceptibility of sPLA2-V–deficient mice to aortic dissection. These findings reveal an unexplored functional link between sPLA2-driven phospholipid metabolism and aortic stability, possibly contributing to the development of improved diagnostic and/or therapeutic strategies for preventing aortic dissection.

Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that is caused by a tear in the intimal layer of the aorta or bleeding within the aortic wall, leading to the separation of the layers of the aortic wall. Two-thirds of such cases involve dissection of the thoracic ascending aorta, which is highly lethal (10–35%) even if emergency surgery can be performed at specialist centers (1Nienaber C.A.

Although there are only limited opportunities for examining the pathogenesis of aortic dissection in patients who are seen after onset, several recent investigations using animal models have improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition. It has been shown that aortic dissection can be induced by infusion of angiotensin II (AT-II), which raises blood pressure, into mice with an ApoE−/− genetic background, which develop extensive atherosclerosis characterized by an unusual plasma lipid profile (4Saraff K. Babamusta F. Cassis L.A. Daugherty A. Aortic dissection precedes formation of aneurysms and atherosclerosis in angiotensin II-infused, apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

However, considering that aortic dissection in humans is not accompanied by typical atherosclerotic plaques in many cases (6Coady M.A. Rizzo J.A. Elefteriades J.A.

Two main mechanisms underlying medial fragility of the aortic wall have been proposed: extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and inflammation, where matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to the onset and severity of aortic dissection (3Nienaber C.A.

Interestingly, a recent clinical study involving individuals with higher cardiovascular risks showed that the incidences of major cardiovascular events including aortic rupture were lower among those assigned to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, which abundantly contains oleic acid (OA) and to a lesser extent linoleic acid (LA), than those assigned to a reduced-fat diet (12Estruch R.

As well as being supplied exogenously as nutrients, unsaturated fatty acids are largely stored in membrane phospholipids and can be spatiotemporally released by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes. Among the PLA2 enzymes identified to date, the secreted PLA2 (sPLA2) family comprises the largest subgroup, containing 10 catalytically active isoforms. Individual sPLA2s show distinct tissue distributions and substrate preferences, thereby participating in diverse biological events in response to microenvironmental cues (13Murakami M. Sato H.

Thus, the precise roles of sPLA2s and underlying lipid metabolism in aortic diseases remain controversial, and no report has examined the contributions of sPLA2s to aortic dissection.

We also show that the increased incidence of aortic dissection by endothelial sPLA2-V deficiency could be rescued by dietary supplementation with OA or LA, providing a rationale for the beneficial role of these fatty acids for cardiovascular health. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that, among the nearly full set of sPLA2s, Pla2g2d, Pla2g2e, Pla2g3, and Pla2g5 (encoding sPLA2-IID, -IIE, -III, and -V, respectively) were substantially expressed in the aorta of C57BL/6 mice (male, 8–12 weeks old), Pla2g5 showing the highest expression (Fig. 1A). The expression level of Pla2g5 in the aorta was almost equivalent to that in the heart (Fig. 1B), a tissue previously shown to express this sPLA2 most abundantly (30Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. Cloning and recombinant expression of a novel human low molecular weight Ca2+-dependent phospholipase A2.J. Biol.

The expression levels of Pla2g5 in anatomically distinct aortas, including thoracic ascending, thoracic descending, and abdominal aortas, were almost equal (Fig. S1A). Pla2g5 was also expressed in the inferior vena cava, where its expression level was less than half of that in the aortas (Fig. S1A). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that sPLA2-V protein was localized mainly in the EC lining of the aorta (Fig. 1C) as well as in the myocardium (Fig. S1B) in Pla2g5+/+ mice, whereas its staining was absent in Pla2g5−/− mice. To address the aortic expression of sPLA2-V further, we isolated ECs from aortic tissues using anti-CD31 magnetic beads (Fig. 1D). Consistent with the immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1C), Pla2g5 was expressed almost exclusively in the CD31-positive EC fraction (Fig. 1E). In contrast, the expression of Pla2g2d and Pla2g3 in the CD31-positive EC fraction was far lower than that of Pla2g5, and that of Pla2g2e was distributed mainly in the CD31-negative non-EC fraction (Fig. 1E). Thus, sPLA2-V is the major sPLA2 expressed in aortic ECs in mice. As in mouse ECs, PLA2G5 was the most abundant sPLA2 isoform in human ECs (Fig. S1C), where its expression level was higher than that in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and fibroblasts (Fig. S1D). Following AT-II infusion into mice (the procedure is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1F), the aortic expression of Pla2g5 mRNA as well as mRNAs for the other three sPLA2s (Pla2g2d, Pla2g2e, and Pla2g3) declined over 24–48 h (Fig. 1G). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that, prior to AT-II infusion, sPLA2-V protein was distributed mainly in aortic ECs, being colocalized with the signature EC marker CD31, in Pla2g5+/+ mice but not in Pla2g5−/− mice (Fig. 1H). Even after 48 h of AT-II infusion, at which time Pla2g5 mRNA expression was reduced (Fig. 1G), sPLA2-V protein was still present in the EC lining (Fig. 1H). Interestingly, the aortic staining of sPLA2-V was nearly abolished after infusion of heparin into the circulation (Fig. 1H), suggesting that sPLA2-V, a heparin-binding sPLA2 (32Murakami M.

Consistent with the reduced Pla2g5 expression in the aortas of AT-II–infused mice (Fig. 1G), the expression of PLA2G5 in human aortas obtained by curative resection from six patients with aortic dissection, all of whom had undergone aortic replacement, was significantly lower in dissecting sites than in nondissecting sites (Fig. 1I). Immunohistochemical analysis of the nondissecting site of a patient, where the histology of the aortic wall was maintained, showed that sPLA2-V protein was localized mainly in ECs, which were also positive for CD31 in a serial section (Fig. 1J). Precise evaluation of sPLA2-V immunostaining in the dissecting site was difficult because of the collapsed histology. Nonetheless, expression of PLA2G5 was reduced in cultured human ECs after stimulation for 24 h with AT-II in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. S1E). Thus, although sPLA2-V mRNA expression in ECs is decreased after AT-II treatment in both mice and humans, its protein expression is maintained on EC surfaces likely through binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans. To clarify the roles of sPLA2s in the pathophysiology of aortic dissection, we studied mice with knockout of the four sPLA2s that had been detected in the aorta. AT-II infusion has commonly been used to trigger aortic dissection in mice; however, these models typically require prolonged exposure to AT-II (>4 weeks) or use of elderly mice (>7 months old) or atherosclerosis-prone ApoE−/− mice, and the dissection takes place in the abdominal or thoracic descending, rather than thoracic ascending, aorta (4Saraff K.

Surprisingly, we found that Pla2g5−/− mice, even at a young age (8–12 weeks old), frequently developed aortic dissection after exposure to AT-II for a shorter period. Thus, when subjected to AT-II infusion only for 7 days, nearly half of Pla2g5−/− mice suffered from aortic dissection, which occurred mainly in the thoracic ascending aorta and often extended to the aortic arch (Fig. 2A). Some of the Pla2g5−/− mice died within 3 days due to rupture of the thoracic aorta, which was confirmed by an immediate autopsy showing intrathoracic hematoma accompanied by a tear of the aortic arch (Fig. 2B). Under the same conditions, only a few WT mice displayed a sign of aortic dissection, and none of them suffered sudden death due to aortic rupture. Histological examination of the lesions revealed dissection of the aortic wall with formation of intramural hematoma (as assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining) and disruption of medial elastic fibers (as assessed by Elastica van Gieson (EVG) staining) in Pla2g5−/− mice (Fig. 2C). Thus, on day 7, the incidence of aortic dissection including rupture reached 44% (11 of 25) in Pla2g5−/− mice, whereas few or no aortic lesions were evident in Pla2g2d−/−, Pla2g2e−/−, Pla2g3−/−, or their littermate WT mice (Fig. 2D and Fig. S2 (A–C)). Although hypertension is a main causal factor for aortic dissection and rupture, systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as heart rates were similarly elevated in both Pla2g5+/+ and Pla2g5−/− mice after 2 days of AT-II infusion (Fig. 2E), indicating that the increased incidence of aortic dissection caused by Pla2g5 deficiency was due to a mechanism other than elevated blood pressure. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the increased susceptibility of Pla2g5−/− mice to aortic dissection, we analyzed gene expression in the aortic tissues after 48 h of AT-II infusion, a time point just prior to dissection onset. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of a panel of genes implicated in aortic stability, vascular remodeling, and inflammation showed that the AT-II–induced up-regulation of Lox mRNA, encoding a prototypic LOX that catalyzes the cross-linking of ECM proteins and thereby strengthens the aortic stability (34Rodriguez C.

Forty-three infants diagnosed with HIE within 6 hours of life were included. HIE was severe in 20 infants, moderate in 12, and mild in 11. Infants with moderate-to-severe HIE received whole-body cooling. Both the HIE cohort and a control group of 59 infants with suspected infection underwent measurement of CSF-NSE concentrations at between 12 and 72 hours after birth. aEEG monitoring was started at admission and brain MRI was performed within the first 2 weeks. Neurodevelopment was assessed at 24 months.The HIE group showed higher levels of CSF-NSE than the control group: median 70 ng/ml (29; 205) vs 10.6 ng/ml (7.7; 12.9); p <0.001. Median levels of CSF-NSE in infants with severe, moderate, and mild HIE were 220.5 ng/ml (120.5; 368.8), 45.5 ng/ml (26, 75.3), and 26 ng/ml (18, 33), respectively. CSF-NSE levels correlated were significantly higher in infants with seizures, abnormal aEEG, or abnormal MRI, compared to those without abnormalities. Infants with an adverse outcome showed higher CSF-NSE levels than those with normal findings (p<0.001), and the most accurate CSF-NSE cutoff level for predicting adverse outcome in the whole cohort was 108 ng/ml and 50ng/ml in surviving infants.In the era of hypothermia, CSF-NSE concentrations provides valuable information as a clinical surrogate of the severity of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage, and this information may be predictive of abnormal outcome at two years of age."
https://openalex.org/W3029126782,"Climate models agree in predicting scenarios of global warming. In endothermic species heat stress takes place when they are upper their thermal neutral zone. Any physiological or behavioural mechanism to mitigate heat stress is at the cost of diverting energy from other physiological functions, with negative repercussions for individual fitness. Tolerance to heat stress differs between species, age classes and sexes, those with the highest metabolic rates being the most sensitive to stressing thermal environments. This is especially important during the first months of life, when most growth takes place. Red deer (Cervus elaphus) is supposedly well adapted to a wide range of thermal environments, based on its worldwide distribution range, but little is known about the direct effect that heat stress may have on calf growth. We assessed the effect that heat stress, measured by heat stress indices and physical environment variables (air temperature, relative air humidity, wind speed and solar radiation), have on calf and mother body weights from calf´s birth to weaning. We used 9265 longitudinal weekly body weight records of calf and mother across 19 years in captive Iberian red deer. We hypothesised that (i) heat stress in hot environments has a negative effect on calf growth, especially in males, as they are more energetically demanding to produce than females; and that (ii) the body weight of the mother through lactation should be negatively affected by heat stress. Our results supported hypothesis (i) but not so clearly hypothesis (ii). By weaning (day 143) calves growing under low heat stress environment grew up to 1.2 kg heavier than those growing in high heat stress environment, and males were more affected by heat stress than females. The results have implications in animal welfare, geographical clines in body size and adaptation to climate change."

Although structurally diverse, each member of this growing gene family contains a PKA anchoring helix that binds with high affinity to docking and dimerization domains of the regulatory subunits of the PKA holoenzyme (9Carr D.W.

These protein–protein interactions not only enable the local modulation of substrates by phosphorylation, but also facilitate their preferential dephosphorylation by AKAP-associated phosphatases. Subcellular localization of individual AKAP signaling complexes is mediated by unique targeting domains on each anchoring protein that direct kinase/phosphatase assemblies to membranes, the cytoskeleton, and organelles (8Smith F.D.

For example, a 30-amino-acid mitochondrial targeting domain (MTD) directs the dual-specificity anchoring protein dAKAP1 (also called sAKAP84, AKAP149; gene AKAP1) to outer mitochondrial membranes (14Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. Identification of a novel protein kinase A anchoring protein that binds both type I and type II regulatory subunits.J. Biol.

Recent evidence suggests that other domains on dAKAP1 contribute to its various biological roles (16Ginsberg M.D. Feliciello A. Jones J.K. Avvedimento E.V. Gottesman M.E. PKA-dependent binding of mRNA to the mitochondrial AKAP121 protein.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327 (12654270): 885-89710.1016/S0022-2836(03)00173-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Association with RNA is thought to proceed through a K homology (KH) domain (17Rogne M. Landsverk H.B. Van Eynde A. Beullens M. Bollen M. Collas P. Kuntziger T. The KH-Tudor domain of a-kinase anchoring protein 149 mediates RNA-dependent self-association.Biochemistry. 2006; 45 (17154535): 14980-1498910.1021/bi061418yCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Accordingly, dAKAP1 association with mRNA for steroidogenic acute regulator (StAR) protein is thought to enhance cAMP-responsive regulation of steroid hormone synthesis (18Grozdanov P.N. Stocco D.M. Short RNA molecules with high binding affinity to the KH motif of A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1): implications for the regulation of steroidogenesis.Mol. Endocrinol. 2012; 26 (23077346): 2104-211710.1210/me.2012-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similarly, the Tudor domain of dAKAP1 is thought to recruit argonaute 2 (Ago2), a member of the RNA-induced silencing complex (19Merrill R.A. Strack S. Mitochondria: a kinase anchoring protein 1, a signaling platform for mitochondrial form and function.Int. J Biochem. Cell Biol. 2014; 48 (24412345): 92-9610.1016/j.biocel.2013.12.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, these molecular interactions may be necessary for posttranscriptional regulation of selected dAKAP1-associated RNAs. In this report, we show that dAKAP1 interacts with several components of ribonucleoprotein granules, the intracellular substructures composed of RNA and proteins that participate in mRNA translation, storage, and decay. Subsequent RNA-Seq analyses uncover that dAKAP1 anchors RNAs that encode electron transport chain and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) components at the outer mitochondrial membrane. These results imply that dAKAP1 not only anchors second messenger signaling enzymes, but also sequesters RNA regulatory and cotranslation machinery at the outer mitochondrial membrane. A common feature of anchoring proteins is a modular organization in which structured protein interaction domains are linked by regions of intrinsic disorder (1Scott J.D. Pawson T. Cell signaling in space and time: where proteins come together and when they're apart.Science. 2009; 326 (19965465): 1220-122410.1126/science.1175668Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 20Nygren P.J.

Nott T.J. Jin J. Pawson T. Deciphering arginine methylation: Tudor tells the tale.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12 (21915143): 629-64210.1038/nrm3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Whereas the mitochondrial targeting and signaling enzyme binding properties of dAKAP1 have been thoroughly investigated, much less is known about how this anchoring protein interfaces with RNA or proteins that contain methylated arginine (7Steen R.L. Martins S.B. Tasken K. Collas P. Recruitment of protein phosphatase 1 to the nuclear envelope by A- kinase anchoring protein AKAP149 is a prerequisite for nuclear lamina assembly.J.

As a prelude to investigation of these uncharacterized macromolecular interactions, we disrupted the AKAP1 gene in HEK293T cells. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was performed with guide RNAs that target exon 2, upstream of the KH and Tudor domains (Fig. 1A). Interruption of the AKAP1 gene was validated by nucleotide sequencing (Fig. S1A). Immunoblots and RII overlays confirmed that expression of dAKAP1 protein was eliminated (Fig. 1B). Three clonal dAKAP1 null cell lines were derived (Fig. 1B, top, lanes 2–4). Immunofluorescent staining of WT cells revealed a distribution of dAKAP1 (green) signal that localized to the mitochondria (as indicated by the mitochondrial marker MitoTracker, deep red; Fig. 1C and the higher magnification inset). DAPI staining (blue) detected nuclei (Fig. 1C). The dAKAP1 signal was absent from dAKAP1−/− cells, although mitochondrial morphology remained intact (Fig. 1D and higher magnification inset). Similar results were obtained upon validation of the other dAKAP1−/− clonal cell lines (Fig. S1, B–D). Hence, these dAKAP1−/− cells served as a valuable reference reagent for rescue experiments that monitored how modified dAKAP1 forms alter scaffolding and ribonucleotide binding of the anchoring protein. Interaction with PKA was abrogated via site-directed mutagenesis of two residues in the PKA binding helix (9Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (1860836): 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). Transfection of a V5-tagged ΔPKA dAKAP1 construct restored protein expression as assessed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1F, top, lane 2). Loss of PKA anchoring was validated by RII overlay (Fig. 1F, middle, lane 3). Equivalent expression of both proteins was evident in cell lysates, and detection of GAPDH served as a loading control (Fig. 1F, lower). Similarly, a nontargeting form of dAKAP1 was created by deleting the mitochondrial targeting domain (dAKAP1ΔMTD; Fig. 1G). V5-tagged forms of the anchoring protein were immunoprecipitated from mitochondrial fractions. The full-length anchoring protein was present in mitochondrial fractions, as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 1H, top, lane 2). Importantly, the faster migrating dAKAP1ΔMTD form (seen as a doublet because of proteolysis) was only detected in total lysates (Fig. 1H, lower-middle, lane 3). Immunoblot detection of TOM20 served as a mitochondrial marker (Fig. 1H, lower-middle). These rescue experiments indicate that dAKAP1ΔMTD is excluded from mitochondria. Homology modeling of the KH domain in dAKAP1 revealed which residues were important for RNA binding and stabilization (Fig. 1, I and J). Whereas the structural basis for specificity in KH domain–RNA interactions has yet to be completely elucidated, a GxxG motif forms a binding loop for RNA in many KH domains (25Valverde R. Edwards L. Regan L. Structure and function of KH domains.FEBS J. 2008; 275 (18422648): 2712-272610.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06411.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This corresponds to glycine 624 to glycine 627 (Gly624-Lys-Gln-Gly627) in human dAKAP1 (Fig. 1K). These residues form an electrostatically positive surface that interfaces with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of RNA (Fig. 1K, orange). Substituting aspartic acids in the GxxG loop introduces an electrostatically negative surface that hinders RNA binding but does not alter the stability of the anchoring protein (26Hollingworth D. Candel A.M. Nicastro G. Martin S.R. Briata P. Gherzi R. Ramos A. KH domains with impaired nucleic acid binding as a tool for functional analysis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 (22547390): 6873-688610.1093/nar/gks368Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, L and M). This mutant anchoring protein, designated dAKAP1ΔRNA, is utilized as a control in later phases of this study. Because the KH domain in dAKAP1 engages mRNAs, we hypothesized that the tandem KH-Tudor moiety could serve as a platform for recruitment of RNA-binding proteins. To investigate this at the molecular level, the KH-Tudor moiety (designated KHT) was bacterially expressed as a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion (Fig. 2, A and B). The mouse Leydig cell line MA10 was chosen because of abundant expression of Star mRNA and protein. Star mRNA is known to interact with dAKAP1 (18Grozdanov P.N. Stocco D.M. Short RNA molecules with high binding affinity to the KH motif of A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1): implications for the regulation of steroidogenesis.Mol. Endocrinol. 2012; 26 (23077346): 2104-211710.1210/me.2012-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, MA10 cells provided a consistent source of material for our proteomic and RNA interaction analyses (18Grozdanov P.N. Stocco D.M. Short RNA molecules with high binding affinity to the KH motif of A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1): implications for the regulation of steroidogenesis.Mol. Endocrinol. 2012; 26 (23077346): 2104-211710.1210/me.2012-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Purified KHT was used as bait to capture interacting partners from MA10 cell lysates (Fig. 2C, lane 1). Control pulldowns were performed with MBP alone (Fig. 2C, lane 2). Analysis by LC-MS/MS identified 1181 putative interacting proteins (Fig. 2, D and E, light gray). Peptides corresponding to 487 of these proteins (≥2 per hit) were present in all five replicates (Fig. 2E, dark gray). Of these, 40 proteins were enriched with a normalized intensity of 5-fold in the KHT pulldown over the MBP control (Fig. 2, D and E, red; p < 0.05). Using the Gene Ontology (GO) database, we probed for possible functions of these high-stringency KHT-binding partners (27Ashburner M. Ball C.A. Blake J.A. Botstein D. Butler H. Cherry J.M. Davis A.P. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S. Eppig J.T. Harris M.A. Hill D.P. Issel-Tarver L. Kasarskis A. Lewis S. et al.Gene ontology: tool for the unification of biology.Nat.

Gene Ontology molecular functions with a p value of <0.001 included RNA-binding functions, such as mRNA coding sequence (CDS) binding, pre-mRNA 3′ splice site binding, and poly(A) RNA binding (Fig. 2F). In parallel, we queried the STRING database to identify prospective protein–protein interactions among our cohort of KHT-binding partners (29Szklarczyk D. Franceschini A. Wyder S. Forslund K. Heller D. Huerta-Cepas J. Simonovic M. Roth A. Santos A. Tsafou K.P. Kuhn M. Bork P. Jensen L.J. von Mering C. STRING v10: protein-protein interaction networks, integrated over the tree of life.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (25352553): D447-D45210.1093/nar/gku1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (5483) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 2G, three subcomplexes were predicted: components of the spliceosome (green), the ribosome (magenta), and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules (blue). Because the latter group was most enriched in our proteomic screen, we further investigated the association of two key RNP components, PABPC1 and LARP4, with the full-length anchoring protein. Validation of the interaction between dAKAP1 and the ribonucleoprotein components PABPC1 and LARP4 at mitochondria proceeded in several phases (Fig. 3A). Rescue experiments in the dAKAP1−/− genetic background revealed that PABPC1 associates with V5-tagged dAKAP1 (Fig. 3B, top, lane 2). Antibody compatibility issues required immunoprecipitation of V5-tagged dAKAP1 rather than the native human anchoring protein. Immunoblotting of cell lysates monitored expression levels of endogenous PABPC1, V5-dAKAP1 rescue, and GAPDH loading controls (Fig. 3B, lower). Related analyses focused on the LARP4-dAKAP1 interface. Coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed that rescue with dAKAP1 restores capture of LARP4 (Fig. 3C, top, lane 2) in the context of the dAKAP1−/− genetic background (Fig. 3C, top, lane 1). Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates monitored expression levels of LARP4, dAKAP1, and GAPDH loading controls (Fig. 3C, lower). Reciprocal experiments captured endogenous dAKAP1 upon immunoprecipitation of LARP4 (Fig. S2A). Structured illumination (SIM) immunofluorescent microscopy revealed that the intracellular distribution of LARP4 (green) and dAKAP1 (magenta) correlated with the mitochondrial marker MitoTracker (cyan; Fig. 3D, insets and composite image). Three-dimensional reconstruction and surface rendering of mitochondria (boxed region, Fig. 3D) verify that dAKAP1 (magenta) and LARP4 (green) signals adopt similar topologies as they decorate these organelles (Figs. 3, E–G). Colocalization of the LARP4 and dAKAP1 signals in an independent sample is shown (Fig. 3H). Regions of signal overlap are indicated in white (Fig. 3H). The extent of LARP4/dAKAP1 signal overlap was evaluated by line plot intensity profiling (Figs. 3H, yellow line, and I). The LARP4 (green) and dAKAP1 (magenta) signals exhibit comparable intensity profiles (Fig. 3I). These findings support the notion that these proteins form complexes at the mitochondria. Additional biochemical analyses were conducted in dAKAP1−/− cells. Subcellular fractionation revealed that LARP4 protein was depleted from mitochondrial fractions in two independent dAKAP1−/− clonal cell lines (Fig. 3J, middle, lanes 2 and 3). Immunoblot detection of TOM20 served as a control marker for mitochondrial enrichment (Fig. 3J, lower-middle). In contrast, immunoblot analysis of crude lysates revealed that total cellular LARP4 levels were unchanged in both genotypes (Fig. 3J, bottom). Further confirmation of this result was provided by rescue experiments where overexpression of WT dAKAP1 restored accumulation of LARP4 to mitochondrial fractionations (Fig. 3K, top, lane 3). Importantly, enrichment of mitochondrial LARP4 was not observed when rescue experiments were conducted with dAKAP1ΔMTD (Fig. 3K, top, lane 4). Immunoblot analysis of VDAC expression served as a marker for mitochondrial enrichment and a control, unaltered protein (Fig. 3K, middle). Taken together, these biochemical studies indicate that dAKAP1 facilitates mitochondrial accumulation of the RNP-associated factor LARP4. Attempts to detect this phenomenon by superresolution imaging were less conclusive. LARP4 signal (green) was regionally distributed at perinuclear sites reminiscent of mitochondria (Fig. 3L). However, line plot intensity profiles of LARP4 (green) and MitoTracker (blue) signals were not well correlated (Fig. 3M). Thus, loss of dAKAP1 reduces LARP4 recruitment to mitochondria but does not cause total exclusion of this RNP protein from these organelles. The next phase of investigation was to establish if RNP proteins were recruited to dAKAP1 through association with RNA. To test this hypothesis, we used a coimmunoprecipitation approach in dAKAP1−/− cells. We evaluated LARP4 interaction upon rescue with the RNA binding-defective dAKAP1ΔRNA form. Capture of LARP4 was reduced in the presence of dAKAP1ΔRNA compared with experiments conducted with the WT anchoring protein (Fig. 3N, top, lanes 2 and 3, and Fig. S2B). Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates monitored expression levels of V5-dAKAP1 and LARP4, as well as GAPDH loading controls (Fig. 3N, lower). These studies demonstrate that association with RNA is a factor in the recruitment of LARP4 to dAKAP1 (Fig. 3A). The LARP4–dAKAP1 interaction is especially intriguing, because LARP4 is predicted to be a PKA substrate (30Blom N. Sicheritz-Ponten T. Gupta R. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. Prediction of post-translational glycosylation and phosphorylation of proteins from the amino acid sequence.Proteomics. 2004; 4 (15174133): 1633-164910.1002/pmic.200300771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation studies revealed that LARP4 robustly incorporated 32P in the presence of exogenous PKA, as assessed by PhosphorImager analysis (Fig. S3A, lane 4). We further examined this phosphorylation event within the context of intact dAKAP1-PKA signaling assemblies. Immune complexes of dAKAP1 were secondarily fractionated by a phospho-PKA substrate antibody. Increased levels of LARP4 were detected by immunoblotting in the presence of full-length dAKAP1 (Fig. S3B, top, lane 2). This signal was reduced upon rescue with the kinase anchoring-defective dAKAP1ΔPKA form (Fig. S3B, top, lane 3). Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates monitored expression levels of dAKAP1 and LARP4 as well as GAPDH loading controls (Fig. S3B, lower). Collectively, these studies validate our proteomic data and indicate that the RNP component PABPC1 and the PKA substrate LARP4 are elements of dAKAP1 signaling islands (Fig. 3A). A biological role for anchored PABPC1/LARP4 subcomplexes could be to promote local translation of dAKAP1-associated mRNAs. To test this idea, we utilized SUrface SEnsing of Translation (SUnSET), a puromycin-based technique that monitors nascent protein synthesis (31Schmidt E.K. Clavarino G. Ceppi M. Pierre P. SUnSET, a nonradioactive method to monitor protein synthesis.Nat Methods. 2009; 6 (19305406): 275-27710.1038/nmeth.1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently treated with puromycin (10 µg/ml), an antibiotic that is incorporated into polypeptide chains (32David A. Dolan B.P. Hickman H.D. Knowlton J.J. Clavarino G. Pierre P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Nuclear translation visualized by ribosome-bound nascent chain puromycylation.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197 (22472439): 45-5710.1083/jcb.201112145Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Immunoblot detection of puromycin labeling in isolated mitochondrial fractions served as an index of local translation (Fig. 3O, top). The puromycin signal was more pronounced in mitochondrial lysates prepared from WT cells than dAKAP1−/− cells (Fig. 3O, top, lane 1). Controls included immunoblot detection of dAKAP1 and TOM20, as well as treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide to globally block translation (Fig. 3O, lower, and Fig. S4A). Immunoblot quantification of puromycin labeling was performed by line plots and area under the curve measurement (Fig. S4B). Analysis of in situ puromycin labeling revealed that mitochondrial signal was reduced in dAKAP1−/− cells compared with that of the WT (Fig. 3P, red column). Additional controls included analysis of cells pretreated with cycloheximide (Fig. S4C). Together, the findings in Fig. 3 imply that dAKAP1 serves as a platform for the assembly of RNA translation machinery. Loss of dAKAP1 precludes mitochondrial tethering of PABPC1 and LARP4, thereby attenuating local protein synthesis. A logical extension of our working hypothesis was to query which mRNAs are incorporated into dAKAP1 signaling complexes. RNA-Seq was used to catalog RNAs that associate with the KH-Tudor moiety (Fig. 4A). Purified total RNA from MA10 cells was incubated with KHT protein. This mouse Leydig cell line was chosen for abundant expression of the Star mRNA (18Grozdanov P.N. Stocco D.M.

https://openalex.org/W3028996777,"In the United States (U.S.), the HIV infection rate is disproportionately high among incarcerated individuals. HIV-infected individuals typically receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress HIV and reduce the threat of transmission. Although HIV-infected individuals are generally ART-adherent while incarcerated, the public health benefits experienced during incarceration are often lost as HIV-infected individuals struggle to maintain optimal adherence post-incarceration. While the importance of maintaining adherence in the post-incarceration period has been acknowledged, research on barriers to ART adherence during this period is limited. To better understand post-release barriers to ART adherence, we conducted in-depth interviews with 20 HIV-infected formerly incarcerated individuals in New York City; we also followed up with 18 (90%) participants after three months to explore whether their adherence challenges changed over time. Viral load testing results from their most recent physician visit were also recorded at each interview. Interviews were transcribed using transcription software and reviewed for accuracy by a researcher. Thematic coding based on discussion guide prompts were then used to identify commonly mentioned barriers to adherence. The results identified four overarching themes that affected study participants’ efforts to adhere to their ART regimen: medication burden, forgetfulness, mental health and emotional difficulties, and perceived conflict between substance use and medication adherence. These barriers were the most commonly cited and largely persisted at three-month follow-up. The results suggest that interventions addressing these challenges are essential for promoting ART adherence among HIV-infected formerly incarcerated individuals. Effective interventions may include mobile-based text messaging reminders and those that facilitate patient-provider communication. Additionally, interventions or programs that integrate substance use and mental health treatment into HIV-related care, along with other types of behavioral health support, may also be beneficial for this population. Such interventions should be a routine part of discharge planning and support for incarcerated individuals returning to the community."
https://openalex.org/W3022711429,"Background Removal of cement-retained implant fixed restorations when needed, can be challenging. Conventional methods of crown removal are time consuming and costly for patients and practitioners. This research explored the use of two different types of pulsed erbium lasers as a non-invasive tool to retrieve cemented zirconia crowns from zirconia implant abutments. Materials and methods Twenty identical zirconia crowns were cemented onto 20 identical zirconia prefabricated abutments using self-adhesive resin cement. The specimens were divided into two groups for laser assisted crown removal; G1 for erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser (Er:YAG), and G2 for erbium, chromium-doped yttrium, scandium, gallium and garnet (Er,Cr:YSGG). For the G1, after the first crown removal, the specimens were re-cemented and removed again using the Er:YAG laser. Times needed to remove the crowns were recorded and analyzed using ANOVA (α = 0.05). The surfaces of the crown and the abutment were further examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses. Results The average times of zirconia crown removal from zirconia abutments were 5 min 20 sec and 5 min 15 sec for the Er:YAG laser of first and second experiments (G1), and 5 min 55 sec for the Er,Cr:YSGG laser experiment (G2). No statistical differences were observed among the groups. SEM and EDS examinations of the materials showed no visual surface damaging or material alteration from the two pulsed erbium lasers. Conclusions Both types of pulsed erbium lasers can be viable alternatives for retrieving a zirconia crown from a zirconia implant abutment. Despite operating at different wavelengths, the Er:YAG and Er,Cr:YSGG lasers, perform similarly in removing a zirconia crown from a zirconia implant abutment with similar parameters. There are no visual and elemental composition damages as a result of irradiation with pulsed erbium lasers."
https://openalex.org/W3028654748,"Aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (ACLP) is a collagen-binding extracellular matrix protein that has important roles in wound healing and fibrosis. ACLP contains thrombospondin repeats, a collagen-binding discoidin domain, and a catalytically inactive metallocarboxypeptidase domain. Recently, mutations in the ACLP-encoding gene, AE-binding protein 1 (AEBP1), have been discovered, leading to the identification of a new variant of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome causing connective tissue disruptions in multiple organs. Currently, little is known about the mechanisms of ACLP secretion or the role of post-translational modifications in these processes. We show here that the secreted form of ACLP contains N-linked glycosylation and that inhibition of glycosylation results in its intracellular retention. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we determined that glycosylation of Asn-471 and Asn-1030 is necessary for ACLP secretion and identified a specific N-terminal proteolytic ACLP fragment. To determine the contribution of secreted ACLP to extracellular matrix mechanical properties, we generated and mechanically tested wet-spun collagen ACLP composite fibers, finding that ACLP enhances the modulus (or stiffness), toughness, and tensile strength of the fibers. Some AEBP1 mutations were null alleles, whereas others resulted in expressed proteins. We tested the hypothesis that a recently discovered 40-amino acid mutation and insertion in the ACLP discoidin domain regulates collagen binding and assembly. Interestingly, we found that this protein variant is retained intracellularly and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress identified with an XBP1-based endoplasmic reticulum stress reporter. Our findings highlight the importance of N-linked glycosylation of ACLP for its secretion and contribute to our understanding of ACLP-dependent disease pathologies."

We attempted to formulate a framework for initial flood drainage rights allocation to promote the sustainable drainage of the Sunan Canal, China. The Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model was constructed using a literature review and interviews with experts and directors using 18 key indicators being determined from field surveys and library studies. We then assessed the flood status of Zhenjiang City, Changzhou City, Wuxi City and Suzhou City in the Sunan Canal zone using an entropy-based matter-element model. The flood drainage rights for a total of 400m3/s was allocated to the four cities in accordance with their flood status. Our research demonstrated that, overall, the four cities may gain the flood drainage rights of 106.67m3/s,120.40m3/s, 118.22m3/s and 54.71m3/s, respectively. Specifically, the calculation of the flood drainage for Wuxi was very close to the actual allocation in 2016, whereas there were differences in the other cities that should not be neglected."
https://openalex.org/W3030861957,"Enzymes acting on α-L-arabinofuranosides have been extensively studied; however, the structures and functions of β-L-arabinofuranosidases are not fully understood. Three enzymes and an ABC transporter in a gene cluster of Bifidobacterium longum JCM 1217 constitute a degradation and import system of β-L-arabinooligosaccharides on plant hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins. An extracellular β-L-arabinobiosidase (HypBA2) belonging to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 121 plays a key role in the degradation pathway by releasing β-1,2-linked arabinofuranose disaccharide (β-Ara2) for the specific sugar importer. Here, we present the crystal structure of the catalytic region of HypBA2 as the first three-dimensional structure of GH121 at 1.85 Å resolution. The HypBA2 structure consists of a central catalytic (α/α)6 barrel domain and two flanking (N- and C-terminal) β-sandwich domains. A pocket in the catalytic domain appears to be suitable for accommodating the β-Ara2 disaccharide. Three acidic residues Glu383, Asp515, and Glu713, located in this pocket, are completely conserved among all members of GH121; site-directed mutagenesis analysis showed that they are essential for catalytic activity. The active site of HypBA2 was compared with those of structural homologs in other GH families: GH63 α-glycosidase, GH94 chitobiose phosphorylase, GH142 β-L-arabinofuranosidase, GH78 α-L-rhamnosidase, and GH37 α,α-trehalase. Based on these analyses, we concluded that the three conserved residues are essential for catalysis and substrate binding. β-L-Arabinobiosidase genes in GH121 are mainly found in the genomes of bifidobacteria and Xanthomonas species, suggesting that the cleavage and specific import system for the β-Ara2 disaccharide on plant hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins are shared in animal gut symbionts and plant pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3030878554,"Pharmacotherapy with two antiepileptic drugs in combination is usually prescribed to epilepsy patients with refractory seizures. The choice of antiepileptic drugs in combination should be based on synergistic cooperation of the drugs with respect to suppression of seizures. The selection of synergistic interactions between antiepileptic drugs is challenging issue for physicians, especially, if 25 antiepileptic drugs are currently available and approved to treat epilepsy patients. The aim of this study was to determine all possible interactions among 5 second-generation antiepileptic drugs (gabapentin (GBP), lacosamide (LCM), levetiracetam (LEV), pregabalin (PGB) and retigabine (RTG)) in the 6-Hz corneal stimulation-induced seizure model in adult male albino Swiss mice. The anticonvulsant effects of 10 various two-drug combinations of antiepileptic drugs were evaluated with type I isobolographic analysis associated with graphical presentation of polygonogram to visualize the types of interactions. Isobolographic analysis revealed that 7 two-drug combinations of LEV+RTG, LEV+LCM, GBP+RTG, PGB+LEV, GBP+LEV, PGB+RTG, PGB+LCM were synergistic in the 6-Hz corneal stimulation-induced seizure model in mice. The additive interaction was observed for the combinations of GBP+LCM, GBP+PGB, and RTG+LCM in this seizure model in mice. The most beneficial combination, offering the highest level of synergistic suppression of seizures in mice was that of LEV+RTG, whereas the most additive combination that protected the animals from seizures was that reporting additivity for RTG+LCM. The strength of interaction for two-drug combinations can be arranged from the synergistic to the additive, as follows: LEV+RTG > LEV+LCM > GBP+RTG > PGB+LEV > GBP+LEV > PGB+RTG > PGB+LCM > GBP+LCM > GBP+PGB > RTG+LCM."
https://openalex.org/W3028888095,"Background The pattern of myocardial fibrosis differs significantly between different cardiomyopathies. Fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characteristically as patchy and regional but in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as diffuse and global. We sought to investigate if texture analyses on myocardial native T1 mapping can differentiate between fibrosis patterns in patients with HCM and DCM. Methods We prospectively acquired native myocardial T1 mapping images for 321 subjects (55±15 years, 70% male): 65 control, 116 HCM, and 140 DCM patients. To quantify different fibrosis patterns, four sets of texture descriptors were used to extract 152 texture features from native T1 maps. Seven features were sequentially selected to identify HCM- and DCM-specific patterns in 70% of data (training dataset). Pattern reproducibility and generalizability were tested on the rest of data (testing dataset) using support vector machines (SVM) and regression models. Results Pattern-derived texture features were capable to identify subjects in HCM, DCM, and controls cohorts with 202/237(85.2%) accuracy of all subjects in the training dataset using 10-fold cross-validation on SVM (AUC = 0.93, 0.93, and 0.93 for controls, HCM and DCM, respectively), while pattern-independent global native T1 mapping was poorly capable to identify those subjects with 121/237(51.1%) accuracy (AUC = 0.78, 0.51, and 0.74) (P<0.001 for all). The pattern-derived features were reproducible with excellent intra- and inter-observer reliability and generalizable on the testing dataset with 75/84(89.3%) accuracy. Conclusion Texture analysis of myocardial native T1 mapping can characterize fibrosis patterns in HCM and DCM patients and provides additional information beyond average native T1 values."

Folded C-Pro domains then template the formation of triple helices between appropriate partner strands. Numerous C-Pro missense variants that disrupt or delay triple-helix formation are known to cause disease, but our understanding of the specific proteostasis defects introduced by these variants remains immature. Moreover, it is unclear whether or not recognition and quality control of misfolded C-Pro domains is mediated by recognizing stalled assembly of triple-helical domains or by direct engagement of the C-Pro itself. Here, we integrate biochemical and cellular approaches to illuminate the proteostasis defects associated with osteogenesis imperfecta-causing mutations within the collagen-α2(I) C-Pro domain. We first show that “C-Pro-only” constructs recapitulate key aspects of the behavior of full-length Colα2(I) constructs. Of the variants studied, perhaps the most severe assembly defects are associated with C1163R C-Proα2(I), which is incapable of forming stable trimers and is retained within cells. We find that the presence or absence of an unassembled triple-helical domain is not the key feature driving cellular retention versus secretion. Rather, the proteostasis network directly engages the misfolded C-Pro domain itself to prevent secretion and initiate clearance. Using MS-based proteomics, we elucidate how the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis network differentially engages misfolded C1163R C-Proα2(I) and targets it for ER-associated degradation.

The cysteine residues are important for stability and were also recently shown to be critical for controlling proper heterotrimer formation (10DiChiara A.S. Li R.C. Suen P.H. Hosseini A.S.

These biochemical and structural insights provide a framework to understand how C-Pro mutations can induce collagenopathies. Currently, at least thirty missense mutations in either C-Proα1(I) or C-Proα2(I) are known to cause OI (22Symoens S. Hulmes D.J. Bourhis J.M. Coucke P.J. De Paepe A. Malfait F.

In early studies, it was observed that several variants delay secretion or cause collagen-I overmodification [e.g. C1299W, G1272V, and T1431I in C-Proα1(I) and D1315V and G1176V in C-Proα2(I)] (19Pace J.M.

More recently, studies of C-Proα(I) variants in primary patient cells confirmed that the resulting misfolding can cause aberrant collagen-I trafficking (18Barnes A.M. Ashok A. Makareeva E.N.

Despite this progress, there is much that remains unknown regarding C-Pro proteostasis. Well-appreciated practical challenges associated with biochemical characterization of collagen folding, quality control, and chaperone interactions (24DiChiara A.S. Taylor R.J. Wong M.Y. Doan N.-D. Rosario A.M. Shoulders M.D. Mapping and exploring the collagen-I proteostasis network.ACS Chem.

Many variants have never been subjected to biochemical characterization. Moreover, it is unclear whether or not quality control mechanisms directly recognize misfolded C-Pro domains or if they instead require the presence of a full-length, triple-helix domain-containing collagen molecule stalled at the assembly or folding stage. Along these lines, there is considerable data now available regarding how the ER proteostasis network engages full-length collagen-I (24DiChiara A.S. Taylor R.J. Wong M.Y. Doan N.-D. Rosario A.M. Shoulders M.D. Mapping and exploring the collagen-I proteostasis network.ACS Chem.

We sought to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of how collagen-I folding and assembly is disrupted by disease-causing C-Pro mutations and of how the cell responds to C-Pro misfolding. We focused on C-Proα2(I) variants because, unlike C-Proα1(I), only a single copy of C-Proα2(I) is included in any given assembled heterotrimer. This stoichiometry simplifies analysis, because collagen-I heterotrimers in autosomal dominant patients must then contain only either one or no mutant C-Proα2(I) domains; there can be no cases of normal assemblies that contain both a mutant and a WT monomer. We created a set of full-length and C-Pro-only Colα2(I) constructs spanning a range of OI-causing C-Pro mutations (Figs. 1B–E), including mutations that add or delete Cys residues (e.g. Y1263C [22Symoens S.

We began by showing that these C-Pro-only constructs recapitulate the behavior of the full-length collagen-I constructs, indicating that the presence versus the absence of unassembled or slowly assembling triple-helical domains has little impact on the trafficking of these proteins, which is instead driven mainly by the misbehaving C-Pro domain itself. Arguably, the most severe assembly defect was associated with C1163R C-Proα2(I), which was also the only variant completely retained in cells. We next applied a suite of biochemical and imaging approaches to compare the folding, trafficking, and quality control behavior of WT versus C1163R C-Proα2(I). Finally, we used MS-based proteomics to illuminate how the ER proteostasis network differentially engages normal versus misfolding collagen-I C-Pro domains. Our results provide fresh insights into the molecular determinants of collagen-I proteostasis and will inform continued efforts to resolve dysregulated collagen proteostasis in disease. We began by developing a panel of constructs encoding missense variants of Colα2(I) within the C-Pro domain that are known to cause autosomal-dominant OI (Figs. 1B–E). We chose Y1263C and C1163R C-Proα2(I) (Figs. 1B and C), because they either introduce an extra Cys residue or remove one of the Cys residues present in the WT protein (19Pace J.M. Wiese M.

We selected P1182R (Fig. 1D), because this mutation not only removes a conformationally constrained Pro residue but also introduces an extra positive charge within the Ca2+-binding region of the protein (22Symoens S. Hulmes D.J. Bourhis J.M. Coucke P.J. De Paepe A. Malfait F. Type I procollagen C-propeptide defects: study of genotype-phenotype correlation and predictive role of crystal structure.Hum.

Finally, we employed the G1176V variant (Fig. 1E), a relatively more conservative mutation that was previously proposed to disrupt triple-helix formation (19Pace J.M. Wiese M. Drenguis A.S.

Overmodified Colα2(I) chains were observed in both the medium and cell layer of G1176V Colα2(I)-expressing primary patient fibroblasts (19Pace J.M. Wiese M. Drenguis A.S. Kuznetsova N. Leikin S.

We designed constructs in which full-length Colα2(I) variants were FLAG tagged at their N termini, whereas the corresponding WT Colα1(I) constructs were HA tagged (Fig. 2A). Given the lack of high-quality collagen-I antibodies, this approach enables robust differential detection of the various constructs. We previously showed that such N-terminal tags do not disrupt normal collagen-I assembly (24DiChiara A.S. Taylor R.J. Wong M.Y. Doan N.-D. Rosario A.M. Shoulders M.D. Mapping and exploring the collagen-I proteostasis network.ACS Chem. Biol. 2016; 11 (26848503): 1408-142110.1021/acschembio.5b01083Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We cotransfected WT or mutant full-length Colα2(I) plasmids along with the WT, full-length Colα1(I) plasmid in HEK293T cells. We selected HEK293T cells as an expression platform, because this cell line does not produce endogenous collagen-I, which could otherwise convolute our analyses, and because it was particularly convenient for our downstream studies focusing entirely on the C-Pro domain itself. As a control, cells cotransfected with Colα1(I) and RFP instead of Colα1(I) and Colα2(I) were included in each sample set. We analyzed the resulting lysate and medium samples by immunoblotting of reducing SDS-PAGE gels. We observed that, just like full-length WT Colα1(I) and Colα2(I), all the full-length Colα2(I) OI variants were robustly expressed in cell lysates (Fig. 2B, top). In contrast, analysis of the corresponding medium samples revealed that, whereas all the other full-length Colα2(I) OI variants were secreted at high levels, full-length C1163R Colα2(I) was intracellularly retained (Fig. 2B, bottom). We note that the full-length WT Colα1(I) that was cotransfected with full-length C1163R Colα2(I) secreted normally into the media despite C1163R Colα2(I) retention, consistent with the notion that this mutation may prevent collagen-I heterotrimer assembly without interfering with Colα1(I) homotrimer production (19Pace J.M.

Altogether, these observations are consistent with prior efforts to characterize collagen-I production by patient fibroblasts expressing the same variants. We next asked whether these behaviors would be recapitulated by C-Pro-only constructs, which are much more amenable to detailed biochemical characterization. In particular, we questioned whether the presence or absence of a triple-helical domain was critical for the observed results. To test this possibility, we prepared C-Pro-only constructs lacking collagen-I triple-helical domains such that HA epitope-tagged C-Proα2(I) WT and OI variants could be cotransfected alongside WT FLAG epitope-tagged C-Proα1(I) (Fig. 2C).

https://openalex.org/W3032251522,"Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is an angiogenic and inflammatory disease. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) transduce intracellular signals, resulting in the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), which leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) functions as a mediator of inflammatory responses through TLRs. In this study, we examined the expression of HMGB1 and components of the Toll-like receptor and NF-κB signaling pathways in the outer membrane of CSDH. Eight patients whose outer membrane was successfully obtained during trepanation surgery were included in this study. The expression of TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (Tak1), interferon regulatory factors 3 (IRF3), IκB kinase β (IKKβ), IKKγ, IκBε, IκBα, NF-κB/p65 and β-actin was examined by Western blot analysis. The expression of TLR4, NF-κB/p65 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was also examined by immunohistochemistry. The concentrations of HMGB1 and IL-6 in CSDH fluids were measured using ELISA kits. Above-mentioned molecules were detected in all cases. In addition, TLR4, NF-κB/p65 and IL-6 were localized in the endothelial cells of vessels within CSDH outer membranes. The concentrations of HMGB1 and IL-6 in CSDH fluids were significantly higher than that in the CSF and serum. There existed a correlation between the concentrations of HMGB1 and IL-6 in CSDH fluids. Our data suggest that HMGB1 in CSDH fluids produces the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in endothelial cells through the Toll-like receptor and NF-κB signaling pathways. Anti-HMGB1 therapy might be a useful method to treat the growth of CSDH."
https://openalex.org/W3032651516,"Recently, Wang and Theeuwes used the additional singleton task and showed that attentional capture was reduced for the location that was likely to contain a distractor [1]. It is argued that due to statistical learning, the location that was likely to contain a distractor was suppressed relative to all other locations. The current study replicated these findings and by adding a search-probe condition, we were able to determine the initial distribution of attentional resources across the visual field. Consistent with a space-based resource allocation (""biased competition"") model, it was shown that the representation of a probe presented at the location that was likely to contain a distractor was suppressed relative to other locations. Critically, the suppression of this location resulted in more attention being allocated to the target location relative to a condition in which the distractor was not suppressed. This suggests that less capture by the distractor results in more attention being allocated to the target. The results are consistent with the view that the location that is likely to contain a distractor is suppressed before display onset, modulating the first feed-forward sweep of information input into the spatial priority map."
https://openalex.org/W3028731687,"Background Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating gastrointestinal disease of neonates, especially premature neonates. To date, there is no prophylactic treatment against NEC, except breast milk and slow increase in enteral feeding, and there is no antenatal prophylaxis. Aims To assess possible protective effects of antenatal N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) against the intestinal pathophysiological changes associated with NEC in a rat model of NEC and against its associated mortality. Methods Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups: control (n = 33); NEC (n = 32)-subjected to hypoxia and formula feeding for 4 days to induce NEC; NEC-NAC (n = 34)-with induced NEC and concomitant postnatal NAC administration; NAC-NEC (n = 33)-born to dams treated with NAC for the last 3 days of pregnancy starting at gestational age of 18 days, and then subjected to induced NEC after birth; NAC-NEC-NAC (n = 36)—subjected to induced NEC with both prenatal and postnatal NAC treatment. At day of life 5, weight and survival of pups in the different groups were examined, and pups were euthanized. Ileal TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, NFkB p65, iNOS and cleaved caspase 3 protein levels (western blot) and mRNA expression (RT-PCR) were compared between groups. Results Pup mortality was significantly reduced in the NAC-NEC-NAC group compared to NEC (11% vs. 34%, P<0.05). Ileal protein levels and mRNA expression of all injury markers tested except IL-10 were significantly increased in NEC compared to control. These markers were significantly reduced in all NAC treatment groups (NEC-NAC, NAC-NEC, and NAC-NEC-NAC) compared to NEC. The most pronounced decrease was observed in the NAC-NEC NAC group. Conclusions Antenatal NAC decreases injury markers and mortality associated with NEC in a rat model. Antenatal administration of NAC may present a novel approach for NEC prophylaxis in pregnancies with risk for preterm birth."
https://openalex.org/W3028989839,"Promoters are very important for transcriptional regulation and gene expression, and have become invaluable tools for genetic engineering. Owing to the characteristics of obligate biotrophs, molecular research into obligate biotrophic fungi is seriously lagging behind, and very few of their endogenous promoters have been developed. In this study, a WY7 fragment was predicted in the genome of Oidium heveae Steinmann using PromoterScan. Its promoter function was verified with transient transformations (Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation, ATMT) in Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi nc. The analysis of the transcription range showed that WY7 could regulate GUS expression in both monocots (Zea mays Linn and Oryza sativa L. spp. Japonica cv. Nipponbare) and dicots (N. tabacum and Hylocereus undulates Britt). The results of the quantitative detection showed that the GUS transient expression levels when regulated by WY7 was more than 11.7 times that of the CaMV 35S promoter in dicots (N. tabacum) and 5.13 times that of the ACT1 promoter in monocots (O. sativa). GUS staining was not detected in the T1 generation of the WY7-GUS transgenic N. tabacum. This showed that WY7 is an inducible promoter. The cis elements of WY7 were predicted using PlantCARE, and further experiments indicated that WY7 was a low temperature- and salt-inducible promoter. Soluble proteins produced by WY7-hpa1Xoo transgenic tobacco elicited hypersensitive responses (HR) in N. tabacum leaves. N. tabacum transformed with pBI121-WY7-hpa1Xoo exhibited enhanced resistance to the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). The WY7 promoter has a lot of potential as a tool for plant genetic engineering. Further in-depth studies will help to better understand the transcriptional regulation mechanisms of O. heveae."
https://openalex.org/W3029142014,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae Coq8 is a member of the ancient UbiB atypical protein kinase family. Coq8, and its orthologs UbiB, ABC1, ADCK3, and ADCK4, are required for the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q in yeast, E. coli, A. thaliana, and humans. Each Coq8 ortholog retains nine highly conserved protein kinase-like motifs, yet its functional role in coenzyme Q biosynthesis remains mysterious. Coq8 may function as an ATPase whose activity is stimulated by coenzyme Q intermediates and phospholipids. A key yeast point mutant expressing Coq8-A197V was previously shown to result in a coenzyme Q-less, respiratory deficient phenotype. The A197V substitution occurs in the crucial Ala-rich protein kinase-like motif I of yeast Coq8. Here we show that long-term cultures of mutants expressing Coq8-A197V produce spontaneous revertants with the ability to grow on medium containing a non-fermentable carbon source. Each revertant is shown to harbor a secondary intragenic suppressor mutation within the COQ8 gene. The intragenic suppressors restore the synthesis of coenzyme Q. One class of the suppressors fully restores the levels of coenzyme Q and key Coq polypeptides necessary for the maintenance and integrity of the high-molecular mass CoQ synthome (also termed complex Q), while the other class provides only a partial rescue. Mutants harboring the first class of suppressors grow robustly under respiratory conditions, while mutants containing the second class grow more slowly under these conditions. Our work provides insight into the function of this important yet still enigmatic Coq8 family."

Across four experiments, we studied the interplay between instrumentality-based pro-diversity beliefs, actual instrumentality of ethnic diversity, and outgroup attitudes. Our results do not reveal a robust interaction effect between instrumentality-based pro-diversity beliefs and actual instrumentality of diverse groups. Some evidence, however, supports the assumption that instrumentality-based pro-diversity beliefs yielded a weaker positive or even a negative effect on ethnic outgroup attitudes when ethnic diversity was perceived as non-instrumental (i.e., when diversity was perceived as having a negative impact on group functioning).

https://openalex.org/W3029388791,"As facility-based deliveries increase globally, maternity registers offer a promising way of documenting pregnancy outcomes and understanding opportunities for perinatal mortality prevention. This study aims to contribute to global quality improvement efforts by characterizing facility-based pregnancy outcomes in Kenya and Uganda including maternal, neonatal, and fetal outcomes at the time of delivery and neonatal discharge outcomes using strengthened maternity registers.Cross sectional data were collected from strengthened maternity registers at 23 facilities over 18 months. Data strengthening efforts included provision of supplies, training on standard indicator definitions, and monthly feedback on completeness. Pregnancy outcomes were classified as live births, early stillbirths, late stillbirths, or spontaneous abortions according to birth weight or gestational age. Discharge outcomes were assessed for all live births. Outcomes were assessed by country and by infant, maternal, and facility characteristics. Maternal mortality was also examined.Among 50,981 deliveries, 91.3% were live born and, of those, 1.6% died before discharge. An additional 0.5% of deliveries were early stillbirths, 3.6% late stillbirths, and 4.7% spontaneous abortions. There were 64 documented maternal deaths (0.1%). Preterm and low birthweight infants represented a disproportionate number of stillbirths and pre-discharge deaths, yet very few were born at ≤1500g or <28w. More pre-discharge deaths and stillbirths occurred after maternal referral and with cesarean section. Half of maternal deaths occurred in women who had undergone cesarean section.Maternity registers are a valuable data source for understanding pregnancy outcomes including those mothers and infants at highest risk of perinatal mortality. Strengthened register data in Kenya and Uganda highlight the need for renewed focus on improving care of preterm and low birthweight infants and expanding access to emergency obstetric care. Registers also permit enumeration of pregnancy loss <28 weeks. Documenting these earlier losses is an important step towards further mortality reduction for the most vulnerable infants."
https://openalex.org/W3031051908,"Conversion of cellular prion protein (PrPC) into the pathogenic isoform of prion protein (PrPSc) in neurons is one of the key pathophysiological events in prion diseases. However, the molecular mechanism of neurodegeneration in prion diseases has yet to be fully elucidated because of a lack of suitable experimental models for analyzing neuron-autonomous responses to prion infection. In the present study, we used neuron-enriched primary cultures of cortical and thalamic mouse neurons to analyze autonomous neuronal responses to prion infection. PrPSc levels in neurons increased over the time after prion infection; however, no obvious neuronal losses or neurite alterations were observed. Interestingly, a finer analysis of individual neurons co-stained with PrPSc and phosphorylated protein kinase RNA-activated-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (p-PERK), the early cellular response of the PERK-eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) pathway, demonstrated a positive correlation between the number of PrPSc granular stains and p-PERK granular stains, in cortical neurons at 21 dpi. Although the phosphorylation of PERK was enhanced in prion-infected cortical neurons, there was no sign of subsequent translational repression of synaptic protein synthesis or activations of downstream unfolded protein response (UPR) in the PERK-eIF2α pathway. These results suggest that PrPSc production in neurons induces ER stress in a neuron-autonomous manner; however, it does not fully activate UPR in prion-infected neurons. Our findings provide insights into the autonomous neuronal responses to prion propagation and the involvement of neuron-non-autonomous factor(s) in the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in prion diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3032031982,"Objective To investigate whether leucine-rich α2-glycoprotein (LRG) can be a biomarker for the disease activity, progression, and prognosis of interstitial pneumonia (IP) in patients with dermatomyositis (DM). Methods Correlations between the clinical findings and serum LRG levels were investigated in 46 patients with DM-IP (33 with acute/subacute IP [A/SIP] and 13 patients with chronic IP [CIP], including 10 fatal cases of IP). Results The median serum LRG level of 18.4 (14.6–25.2) μg/mL in DM-IP patients was higher than that in healthy control subjects. The median levels of serum LRG at baseline and at 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment in the patients who died were significantly higher than those in the surviving patients (P = 0.026, 0.029, and 0.008, respectively). The median level of serum LRG in the DM-A/SIP patients was significantly higher than that in the DM-CIP patients (P = 0.0004), and that in the anti-MDA5-Ab-positive group was slightly higher than that in the anti-ARS-Ab-positive group. The serum LRG levels correlated significantly with the serum levels of LDH, C-reactive protein, ferritin, AaDO2, %DLco, and total ground-glass opacity score. The survival rate after 24 weeks in patients with an initial LRG level ≥ 17.6 μg/mL (survival rate: 40%) was significantly lower than that in patients with an initial LRG level < 17.6 μg/mL (100%) (P = 0.0009). Conclusion The serum LRG level may be a promising marker of disease activity, progression, and prognosis in patients with DM-IP."
https://openalex.org/W3029685739,"UltraPrep is an open-source, two-step method for purification of cell-free DNA that entails extraction of total DNA followed by size-selective enrichment of the smaller fragments that are characteristic of DNA originating from fragmentation between nucleosome. The advantages of the two related protocols that are described are that they can easily accommodate a wide range of sample input volumes, they rely on simple, magnetic bead-based technology, the yields of cfDNA are directly comparable to the most popular methods for cfDNA purification, and they dramatically reduce the cost of cfDNA isolation relative to currently available commercial methods. We provide a framework for physical and molecular quality analysis of purified cfDNA and demonstrate that the cfDNA generated by UltraPrep meets or exceeds the quality metrics of the most commonly used procedure. In addition, our method removes high molecular weight genomic DNA (hmwgDNA) that can interfere with downstream assay results, thereby addressing one of the primary concerns for preanalytical collection of blood samples."
https://openalex.org/W3030197448,"Johne's disease (JD) is an infectious wasting condition of ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) in domestic livestock of every country that has been investigated. Controlling JD is problematic due to the lack of sensitive, specific, efficient, and cost-effective diagnostic tests. A major challenge in the development of diagnostics like ELISA is the selection of an ideal antigen/(s) that is pathogen-specific and allows sensitive recognition. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify and use Mce-truncated protein-based ELISA assay for the diagnosis of MAP infection with high sensitivity and specificity. In silico epitope prediction by epitope mapping throughout the whole length of MAP2191 protein revealed that C-terminal portion of this protein presented potential T- and B-cell epitopes. Therefore, a novel Mce-truncated protein encoded by the selected region of MAP2191 gene was expressed, purified with Ni-NTA gel matrix and confirmed by SDS PAGE and western blot. A profiling ELISA assay was developed to evaluate sera from MAP infected and non-infected ruminant species for antibodies against Mce-truncated protein to infer the immunogenicity of this protein in the host. Using this Mce protein-based ELISA, 251 goats, 53 sheep, 117 buffaloes, and 33 cattle serum samples were screened and 49.4, 51.0, 69.2, and 54.6% animals, respectively, were found positive. Comparing with i-ELISA, the new Mce-based ELISA kit showed a relatively higher specificity but suffered from slightly reduced sensitivity. Mce-based ELISA excluded apparently false positive results of i-ELISA. Mce protein was found to be antigenic and Mce-ELISA test could be employed as a diagnostic test for JD in domestic livestock in view of the a relatively higher specificity and accuracy. The antigenic potential of Mce antigen can also be exploited for the development of a new vaccine for the control of MAP infection."
https://openalex.org/W3026953437,"Background The aim of this study was to investigate the effects on subjective and objective sleepiness of a stay above a large struck singing bowl compared to a relaxation period in a silent singing bowl. Methods Fifty-eight healthy subjects were recruited for the study, 48 participated on two days, one week apart, during the same timeslot. The Karolinska sleepiness scale was used to evaluate current subjective sleepiness, and the relative pupillary unrest index to assess objective sleepiness. In this randomized cross-over study, the intervention consisted of a 20-minute stay in a hammock while the singing bowl, positioned beneath, was struck seven times. The controlled comparator was a 20-minute stay in the same hammock above the singing bowl, but without being struck. After these two interventions subjective and objective sleepiness were re-evaluated. Results The mean relative pupillary unrest index values after relaxation in the struck and silent singing bowl groups were 0.74 and respectively 0.71 (p = 0.460). The median Karolinska sleepiness scale value after relaxation with the struck singing bowl was 3 compared with 4 (p = 0.041) for the silent singing bowl. Discussion This study evaluated the influence of a struck singing bowl on sleepiness during daytime. Subjective sleepiness was significantly lower after relaxation above a struck singing bowl. After gender stratification, the difference was still significant in women. Objective sleepiness was not different in both groups. Finally, we can only speculate if women may be more susceptible to subjective improvements in case of sleepiness and show another perception of relaxation in a struck singing bowl compared to men."
https://openalex.org/W3030455767,"Low back pain (LBP) is a common ailment in most developed countries. Because most cases of LBP are known as 'non-specific', it has been challenging to develop experimental pain models of LBP which reproduce patients' clinical pain. In addition, previous models have limited applicability in a steady-pain-state neuroimaging environment. Thus, this study aims to devise a low back pain model with a simple methodology to induce experimental LBP, which has similar pain properties to patients' clinical pain, and to apply the model in a steady-pain-state neuroimaging study.Our low back extension (LBE) pain model was tested on 217 LBP patients outside the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner to determine the reproducibility of endogenous pain and the similarity to their own clinical pain (STUDY1), and applied in a steady-pain-state functional MRI study (47 LBP patients and 23 healthy controls) to determine its applicability (induced head motions and brain functional connectivity changes; STUDY2).By the LBE pain model, 68.2% of the LBP patients reported increased LBP with high similarity of sensations to their own clinical pain (STUDY1), and the head motions were statistically similar to and correlated with those in resting state (STUDY2). Furthermore, the LBE model altered brain functional connectivity by decreasing the default-mode and the sensorimotor networks, and increasing the salience network, which was significantly associated with the intensity of the induced pain. Conversely, the healthy controls showed increased somatosensory network (but not of the cognitive pain processing).Our investigations suggest that our LBE pain model, which increased LBP with high similarity to the LBP patients' own pain sensation and induced patient-specific brain responses with acceptable head motion, could be applied to neuroimaging studies investigating brain responses to different levels of endogenous LBP."
https://openalex.org/W3030914092,"Introduction In health care systems in need of additional intensive care unit (ICU) beds, the decision to mechanically ventilate critically ill patients in Internal Medicine (IM) Department wards needs to balance patients’ health outcomes, possible futility, and logistics. We aimed to examine the survival rates and predictors in these patients. Methods We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients receiving mechanical ventilation during their care in the IM wards of a tertiary University hospital between April 2016 and December 2018. Primary outcome was 90-day mortality and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and ICU transfer. Results Our cohort consisted of 151 unique patient intubations, of whom 74 (49%) patients were transferred to ICU within a median of 0 days (range 0–7). Compared to patients who remained in the wards, patients transferred to ICU had lower in-hospital and 90-day mortality (65% vs. 97%, and 70% vs. 99%, respectively, p<0.001 for both). Amongst several possible predictors of survival in the ICU, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score at the time of intubation had the best prognostic accuracy with an AUROC of 0.818 and 0.855 for in-hospital and 90-day mortality, respectively. A baseline SOFA score ≤8 had a 100% sensitivity for survival prediction in ICU. However, out of 26 patients with SOFA score ≤8 who remained in the wards, only one survived, whereas 19 patients with SOFA score >8 who were transferred to ICUs received futile care. Conclusion Mortality for patients receiving mechanical ventilation in IM wards is almost inevitable when ICU availability is lacking. Therefore, applying additional transfer criteria beyond the SOFA score is imperative."
https://openalex.org/W3031607205,"The dogs' responses to training exercise are seldom monitored using physiological variables, and cardiac autonomic regulation (CAR) is a relevant determinant of endurance-training adaptation. There are studies in the literature establishing that regular exercise could interfere with CAR in dogs, measured by heart rate and vagal-derived indexes of heart-rate-variability (HRV). However, few studies were found using a prescribed training program based on the lactate threshold (LT) to determine HRV by a 24-h Holter analysis. The purpose of this study was to test whether an endurance-training program (ETP) guided individually by LT raises time-domain measures of HRV in healthy Beagle dogs. Twenty dogs were assigned to two groups: control (C) and trained (T). The dogs from group T underwent an incremental exercise test (IET) to determine their LT. Both LT and velocity corresponding to the LT (VLT) was determined by visual inspection. T group performed an eight-week endurance-training program consisting of treadmill runs set to 70-80% of the VLT. Next, dogs from the group T have submitted to IET again. The maximal velocities (Vmax) at which achieved by the trained dogs in both IETs were determined. The group S did not undergo IETs or ETP. HRV was determined by the 24-hour-Holter at rest, before and on the 2°, 4°, 6° and 8° training weeks. To examine the HR impact on HRV, standard HRV variables were normalized to prevailing HR. VLT and Vmax rose in group T, indicating an improvement of dogs' aerobic and anaerobic capacity. The normalized standard HRV indexes were relatively attenuated since these variables had a reduction in the degree of correlation concerning an average HR. The ETP resulted in decreased resting heart rate and increased time-domain indices, highlighting the log-transformed square root of the mean sum of the squared differences between R-R intervals (Ln rMSSD). The lactate-guided endurance-training program could lead to better parasympathetic cardiac modulation in Beagle dogs."
https://openalex.org/W3029125542,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcus) is the etiologic agent for the sexually transmitted Infection gonorrhea, a disease with a significant global public health impact. The treatment regimen for gonorrhea has been changed frequently over the past few decades due to the organism's propensity for developing antibiotic resistance. This study investigated antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of quinolones, third-generation cephalosporin, and other relevant antimicrobials found in N. gonorrhoeae isolated from men presenting with urethral discharge at selected healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with the aim of revising the national treatment regimen based on the information generated from this study.A total of 599 male patients presenting with urethral discharge were included in the current study. Urethral discharge specimens were cultured on Modified Thayer Martín media and suspected gonococcal colonies were confirmed using Oxidase and Superoxol tests followed by identification through a commercial kit (API-NHR). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method using ciprofloxacin (5μg), ceftriaxone (30μg), cefixime (5μg), cefoxitin (30 μg), penicillin (10μg) and spectinomycin (100 μg) on enriched GC agar. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was also carried out using concentration gradient strips (E-tests) of the same antimicrobial agents.The prevalence of gonococcal isolates in the current study was 69%. Out of the 361 gonococcal isolates, close to 68% were fluoroquinolone non-susceptible, with 60% resistant and 7% having an intermediate status. However, all tested isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. In addition, all of the isolates have shown reduced non-susceptibility to spectinomycin and cefoxitin.The prevalence of gonococcal isolates in men presenting with urethral discharge at selected healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia was found to be high. The high level of fluoroquinolone resistance observed in gonococcal isolates recovered in this study necessitates revision of the national syndromic treatment guideline."
https://openalex.org/W3029290981,"To address the problem of endogeneity in public opinion research, this study examines the opinions of healthcare held by the foreign born, i.e. those not socialized in the system they are asked to evaluate. It (a) explores the degree to which the healthcare ratings of the foreign born depend on the country's institutional healthcare setting; (b) stresses the importance of referential standards and the significance of knowledge and previous experiences of healthcare services in the country of origin; and (c) investigates differences in healthcare ratings with the length of time foreign born spent in the destination country. This study uses data from the seven rounds of the European Social Survey (2002-2014) and applies multilevel modelling techniques. Results show the institutional characteristics of healthcare services in the country of residence are associated with healthcare evaluations of the foreign born, in particular if these services are compared to those in the country of origin: the better healthcare institutions perform relative to those in the country of origin, the higher the healthcare ratings. Although comparisons with the country of origin seem relevant to all foreign born, they are sometimes more important to recent arrivals. This study suggests knowledge and experience of different healthcare institutions change perspectives and evaluations of healthcare. This finding enriches the discussion of the effects of socialisation and adaptation processes in the formation of public opinion."
https://openalex.org/W3030959743,"Background Human breast milk (BM) fortification is required to feed preterm newborns with less than 32 weeks of gestation. However, addition of fortifiers increases osmolarity and osmolarity values higher than 450 mOsm/kg may be related to gastrointestinal pathology. Hence, fortifier selection and dosage are key to achieve optimal feeding. Objectives To compare the effect on osmolality of adding different fortifications, including recently developed formulations, to BM and to study evolution of osmolarity over time in supplemented BM. Methods Frozen mature BM from 10 healthy mothers of premature newborns was fortified with each of the following human milk fortifiers (HMF): AlmirónFortifier®, NANFM85®, or PreNANFM85®. In addition, fortified BMs were modified with one of the following nutritional supplements (NS): Duocal MCT®, Nutricia® AminoAcids Mix, or Maxijul®. Osmolality of BM alone, fortified and/or supplemented was measured at 1 and 22 hours after their preparation. All samples were kept at 4°C throughout the study. Results Osmolality of BM alone was close to 300 mOsm/kg and did not change over 22 hours. When equicaloric amounts of HMF AlmirónFortifier®, NANFM85®, and PreNANFM85® were added to BM, osmolality increased roughly to 480 mOsm/kg with the first two fortifiers and only to 433±6 mOsm/kg with the third one. Upon addition of any of four different NSs to BM modified with AlmirónFortifier® and NANFM85®, osmolality reached values greater than 520 mOsm/kg, while osmolality of PreNANFM85® with two out of the four NSs remained below 490 mOsm/kg. NSs supplementing carbohydrates and hydrolysed proteins resulted into a higher increase of BM osmolarity. Osmolality increased significantly with time and, after 22h, only BM modified with PreNANFM85® remained below 450 mOsm/kg. Conclusions Upon addition of the HMFs tested, BM osmolality increases significantly and keeps raising over time. All HMFs but the recently developed PreNAN FM85® at 4% exceed the AAP recommended threshold for osmolarity of 450 mOsm/kg. Addition of NSs to PreNAN FM85® at 4% significantly increases osmolality above 450 mOsm/Kg. Thus, using PreNAN FM85® at 5% may be preferable to adding nutritional supplements since nutritional recommendations by the ESPGHAN are reached with a lower increase in osmolality."
https://openalex.org/W3031336011,"There is great variability in the ways that humans treat one another, ranging from extreme compassion (e.g., philanthropy, organ donation) to self-interested cruelty (e.g., theft, murder). What underlies and explains this variability? Past research has primarily examined human prosociality using explicit self-report scales, which are susceptible to self-presentation biases. However, these concerns can be alleviated with the use of implicit attitude tests that assess automatic associations. Here, we introduce and assess the validity of a new test of implicit prosociality–the Self versus Other Interest Implicit Association Test (SOI-IAT)–administered to two samples in pre-registered studies: regular blood donors (Study 1; N = 153) and a nationally representative sample of Americans (Study 2; N = 467). To assess validity, we investigated whether SOI-IAT scores were correlated with explicit measures of prosociality within each sample and compared SOI-IAT scores of the control sample (representative sample of Americans) with the prosocial sample (blood donors). While SOI-IAT scores were higher in the prosocial blood donor sample, SOI-IAT scores were generally uncorrelated with explicit measures and actual prosocial behaviour. Thus, the SOI-IAT may be able to detect group differences in everyday prosociality, but future testing is needed for a more robust validation of the SOI-IAT. These unexpected findings underscore the importance of sharing null and mixed results to fill gaps in the scientific record and highlight the challenges of conducting research on implicit processes."
https://openalex.org/W3032027300,"In the present study we have characterized the biophysical properties of wild-type (WT) α1β2 and α3β2 GABAA receptors and probed the molecular basis for the observed differences. The activation and desensitization behavior and the residual currents of the receptors expressed in HEK293 cells were determined in whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Kinetic parameters of α1β2 and α3β2 activation differed significantly, with α1β2 and α3β2 exhibiting rise times (10-90%) of 24 ± 2 ms and 51 ± 7 ms, respectively. In contrast, the two receptors exhibited largely comparable desensitization behavior with decay currents that could be fitted to exponential functions with two or three components. Most notably, the two receptor compositions displayed different degrees of desentization, with the residual currents of α1β2 and α3β2 constituting 34 ± 2% and 21 ± 2% of the peak current, respectively. The respective contributions of the extracellular domains and the transmembrane/intracellular domains of the α-subunit to these physiological profiles were next assessed in recordings from cells expressing αβ2 receptors comprising chimeric α-subunits. The rise times displayed by α1ECD/α3TMDβ2 and α3ECD/α1TMDβ2 receptors were intermediate to those of WT α1β2 and WT α3β2, and the distribution of the different components of the current decays exhibited by the two chimeric receptors followed the same pattern as the two WT receptors. The residual current exhibited by α1ECD/α3TMDβ2 (23 ± 3%) was similar to that of α3β2 but significantly different from that of α1β2, whereas the residual current displayed by α3ECD/α1TMDβ2 (27 ± 2%) was intermediate to and did not differ significantly from either of the WT receptors. This points to molecular differences in the transmembrane/intracellular domains of the α-subunit as the main determinants of the observed differences in receptor physiology between α1β2 and α3β2 receptors."
https://openalex.org/W3029868569,"Intentional self-harm is a common cause of hospital presentations in New Zealand and across the world, and self-poisoning is the most common method of self-harm. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is frequently used in impulsive intentional overdoses, where ease of access may determine the choice of substance.This cross-sectional study aimed to determine how much paracetamol is present and therefore accessible in urban New Zealand households, and sources from where it has been obtained. This information is not currently available through any other means, but could inform New Zealand drug policy on access to paracetamol.Random cluster-sampling of households was performed in major urban areas of two cities in New Zealand, and the paracetamol-containing products, quantities, and sources were recorded. Population estimates of proportions of various types of paracetamol products were calculated.A total of 174 of the 201 study households (86.6%) had at least one paracetamol product. Study households had mostly prescription products (78.2% of total mass), and a median of 24.0 g paracetamol present per household (inter-quartile range 6.0-54.0 g). Prescribed paracetamol was the main source of large stock. Based on the study findings, 53% of New Zealand households had 30 g or more paracetamol present, and 36% had 30 g or more of prescribed paracetamol, specifically.This study highlights the importance of assessing whether and how much paracetamol is truly needed when prescribing and dispensing it. Convenience of appropriate access to therapeutic paracetamol needs to be balanced with preventing unnecessary accumulation of paracetamol stocks in households and inappropriate access to it. Prescribers and pharmacists need to be aware of the risks of such accumulation and assess the therapeutic needs of their patients. Public initiatives should be rolled out at regular intervals to encourage people to return unused or expired medicines to pharmacies for safe disposal."

This retrospective review included patients with DHD without XT or ET who underwent augmented LR recession and were followed-up for ≥12 months. Each patient’s medical records were evaluated to identify their demographics, preoperative angle of deviation, surgical procedure, success rate, and reoperation rate. A total of 11 patients with DHD were included (median patient age at surgery, 6 years; interquartile range [IQR], 5 to 10 years). Four patients (36.4%) had a history of infantile ET while three patients (27.3%) had a history of unilateral cataract surgery for congenital cataract. The median preoperative angle of DHD in the unilateral eye was 20 prism diopters (PD) (IQR, 15 to 25 PD). The median amount of LR recession was 8.0 mm (IQR, 7.5 to 8.0 mm). Three patients (27.3%) underwent simultaneous surgery for dissociated vertical deviation. At the final examination after a median follow-up period of 32 months (IQR, 24 to 58 months), 10 patients (91%) showed successful alignment. The long-term successful alignment rate after augmented LR recession for DHD was good; thus, application of this technique is appropriate in patients with DHD."
https://openalex.org/W3029023159,"Melon yellow spot orthotospovirus (MYSV), a member of the genus Orthotospovirus, is an important virus in cucurbits. Thrips palmi is considered the most serious pest of cucurbits because it directly damages and indirectly transmits MYSV to the plant. The effects of MYSV-infected plants on the development time, fecundity, and preference of the thrips were analyzed in this study. Our results showed that the development time of male and female thrips did not differ significantly between MYSV-infected and non-infected cucumbers. The survival rate of thrips in non-infected and MYSV-infected cucumbers were not significantly different. In a non-choice assay, T. palmi adults were released on non-infected and MYSV-infected cucumbers and allowed to lay eggs. The number of hatched larvae did not significantly differ between non-infected and MYSV-infected cucumbers. In a choice assay, MYSV had no detectable effect on the number of adult thrips and preceding hatched larvae. In a pull assay, the settling rate of thrips on the released plant did not differ significantly when the adult thrips were released to non-infected or MYSV infected cucumbers for any cucumber cultivar. Based on our results, we propose that the effects of MYSV-infected cucumbers on the development time, fecundity, or preference of T. palmi may not be an important factor in MYSV spread between cucumbers."

We did regression analysis and analyzed the differences between the two methods with Medcalc software version 19.0.4. The result was showed by Passing-Bablok regression analysis diagram and Bland and Altman plot.The Passing-Bablok showed that the result of proptosis measured by CT and simple Heron's formula showed good positive correlation. A 95% limit of agreement in proptosis between CT and Heron's formula method was -0.46 to 0.54 mm in right eye and -0.45 to 0.46 mm in left eye. 1.66% (1/60) point was outside 95% LoA in both eyes. Moreover, a 95% limit of agreement between CT and Heron's formula method was -0.42 to 0.56 mm in difference of both eyes. 3.33% (2/60) points were outside 95% LoA. The points in all Bland and Altman plots were lower than 5%. It means that the results of comparison between the two methods had a good consistency in the measurement of proptosis.Heron's formula could be applied to calculate proptosis and has a good consistency compared with computed tomography (CT). This method is practical in proptosis assessment because of its accuracy, reliability and simplicity."
