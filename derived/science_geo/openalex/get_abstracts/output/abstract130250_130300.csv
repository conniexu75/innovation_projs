https://openalex.org/W1926303070,"The genome of the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi B31, the aetiologic agent of Lyme disease, contains a linear chromosome of 910,725 base pairs and at least 17 linear and circular plasmids with a combined size of more than 533,000 base pairs. The chromosome contains 853 genes encoding a basic set of proteins for DNA replication, transcription, translation, solute transport and energy metabolism, but, like Mycoplasma genitalium, it contains no genes for cellular biosynthetic reactions. Because B. burgdorferi and M. genitalium are distantly related eubacteria, we suggest that their limited metabolic capacities reflect convergent evolution by gene loss from more metabolically competent progenitors. Of 430 genes on 11 plasmids, most have no known biological function; 39% of plasmid genes are paralogues that form 47 gene families. The biological significance of the multiple plasmid-encoded genes is not clear, although they may be involved in antigenic variation or immune evasion."

https://openalex.org/W1556223086,"Structural and mechanistic studies show that when the selection criteria of the immune system are changed, catalytic antibodies that have the efficiency of natural enzymes evolve, but the catalytic antibodies are much more accepting of a wide range of substrates. The catalytic antibodies were prepared by reactive immunization, a process whereby the selection criteria of the immune system are changed from simple binding to chemical reactivity. This process yielded aldolase catalytic antibodies that approximated the rate acceleration of the natural enzyme used in glycolysis. Unlike the natural enzyme, however, the antibody aldolases catalyzed a variety of aldol reactions and decarboxylations. The crystal structure of one of these antibodies identified the reactive lysine residue that was selected in the immunization process. This lysine is deeply buried in a hydrophobic pocket at the base of the binding site, thereby accounting for its perturbed pKa."

https://openalex.org/W2329617636,"Activation of Myc triggers a rapid induction of cyclin E/cdk2 kinase activity and degradation of p27. Overt degradation of p27 is preceded by a specific dissociation of p27 from cyclin E/cdk2, but not from cyclin D/cdk4 complexes. We now show that cyclin E/cdk2 phosphorylates p27 at a carboxy-terminal threonine residue (T187) in vitro; mutation of this residue to valine stabilises cyclin E/cdk2 complexes. This reaction is not significantly inhibited by high concentrations of p27, suggesting that cdk2 bound to p27 is catalytically active. In vivo, p27 bound to cyclins E and A, but not to D-type cyclins is phosphorylated. Myc-induced release of p27 from cdk2 requires cdk2 kinase activity and is delayed in a T187V mutant of p27. After induction of Myc, p27 phosphorylated at threonine 187 transiently accumulates in a non cdk2 bound form. Our data suggest a mechanism in which p27 is released from cyclin E/cdk2 upon phosphorylation; in Myc-transformed cells, release is efficient as phosphorylated p27 is transiently bound in a non-cdk2 containing complex and subsequently degraded."

https://openalex.org/W2028315004,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) can exert mitogenic and viability-promoting effects in a wide range of biological systems. The biochemical activities mediating the cell survival function of bFGF are largely unknown. We report here that exposure of fibroblasts to bFGF, which confers upon them increased survival, also causes at the same time an increase in cellular levels of the Mdm2 oncoprotein. Cells constitutively exposed to a bFGF autocrine loop are more refractory to killing by cisplatin. This increased chemoresistance coincides with elevated Mdm2 and reduced activation of the endogenous p53, resulting in inefficient transcriptional activation of the bax gene promoter. Importantly, unlike Mdm2 accumulation in fibroblasts exposed to DNA damage, induction of Mdm2 by bFGF does not occur through a p53-mediated pathway. The role of p53 in DNA damage-induced apoptosis and the ability of Mdm2 to block p53-mediated cell death are well established. These findings therefore suggest that induction of Mdm2 and the subsequent inhibition of p53 function may contribute, at least partially, to the anti-apoptotic effects of bFGF and possibly some other survival factors."
https://openalex.org/W1978404812,"Placenta growth factor (PlGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) represent two closely related angiogenic growth factors active as homodimers or heterodimers. Since goiters of the thyroid gland are extremely hypervascular, we investigated the expression of PlGF, VEGF and their receptors, Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR, in a small panel of human goiters from patients with Graves's disease, in an animal model of thyroid goitrogenesis and in in vitro cultured thyroid cells. Here we report that the mRNA expression of PlGF, VEGF and their receptors is markedly enhanced in biopsies of goiters resected from Graves's patients. In vivo studies demonstrated that in the thyroid gland of thiouracil-fed rats, increased mRNA and protein expression of PlGF, VEGF, Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR occurred subsequent to the rise in the serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and in parallel with thyroid capillary proliferation. In vitro studies confirmed the existence of such TSH-dependent paracrine communication between thyroid epithelial cells and endothelium since the conditioned medium collected from TSH-stimulated thyrocytes acquired mitogenic activity for human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells. Altogether, these data suggest that PlGF and VEGF, released by thyrocytes in response to the chronic activation of the TSH receptor pathway, may act through a paracrine mechanism on thyroid endothelium."

https://openalex.org/W2313767788,"The ATM gene product, which is defective in the cancer-prone disorder ataxia telangiectasia, has been implicated in mitogenic signal transduction, chromosome condensation, meiotic recombination and cell cycle control. The ATM gene has homology with the TEL1 gene of yeast, mutations of which lead to shortened telomeres. To test the hypothesis that the ATM gene product is involved in telomere metabolism, we examined telomeric associations (TA), telomere length, and telomerase activity in human cells expressing either dominant-negative or complementing fragments of the ATM gene. The phenotype of RKO colorectal tumor cells expressing ATM fragments containing a leucine zipper (LZ) motif mimics that of ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) cells. These transfected RKO cells relative to transfected controls had a higher frequency of cells with TA and shortened telomeres, but no detectable change in telomerase activity. In addition, the percentage of cells with TA after gamma irradiation was higher in the transfected RKO cells with dominant negative activity of the ATM gene, compared to control cells. SV40 transformed fibroblasts derived from an A-T patient and transfected with a complementing carboxyl terminal kinase region of the ATM gene had a reduced frequency of cells with TA, with no effect on the telomere length or telomerase activity. The present studies using isogenic cells with manipulated ATM function demonstrate a role for the ATM gene product in telomere metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2070001832,"Members of the Ras subfamily of GTP-binding proteins, including Ras (H-, K-, and N-), TC21, and R-ras have been shown to display transforming activity, and activating lesions have been detected in human tumors. We have identified an additional member of the Ras gene family which shows significant sequence similarity to the human TC21 gene. This novel human ras-related gene, R-ras3, encodes for a protein of 209 amino acids, and shows ∼60 – 75% sequence identity in the N-terminal catalytic domain with members of the Ras subfamily of GTP-binding proteins. An activating mutation corresponding to the leucine 61 oncogenic lesion of the ras oncogenes when introduced into R-ras3, activates its transforming potential. R-ras3 weakly stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity, but this effect is greatly potentiated by the co-expression of c-raf-1. By the yeast two-hybrid system, R-ras3 interacts only weakly with known Ras effectors, such as Raf and RalGDS, but not with RglII. In addition, R-ras3 displays modest stimulatory effects on trans-activation from different nuclear response elements which bind transcription factors, such as SRF, ETS/TCF, Jun/Fos, and NF-κB/Rel. Interestingly, Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from various tissues revealed that the 3.8 kilobasepair (kb) transcript of R-ras3 is highly restricted to the brain and heart. The close evolutionary conservation between R-ras3 and Ras family members, in contrast to the significant differences in its biological activities and the pattern of tissue expression, raise the possibility that R-ras3 may control novel cellular functions previously not described for other GTP-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1975215012,"Up-regulation of the p53 protein was found to induce cell cyle arrest at the G1/S border and in some cases at the G2/M border. Futhermore, it was suggested that p53 is associated with the induction of the various DNA repair pathways. Previously, we demonstrated that cells coexpressing endogenous wild type p53 protein, together with dominant negative mutant p53, exhibit deregulation of apoptosis, G1 arrest and delay in G2 following γ-irradiation. IN the present study, we investigated the role of p53 protein in the DNA damage response at the G2 phase. Using p53-null, wild type p53 and mutant p53-producer cell lines, we found that the two C-terminally spliced p53 forms could prevent γ-irradiation induced muatgenesis prior to mitosis, at the G2/M checkpoint. We found that at the G2 phase, p53 may facilitate repair of DNA breaks giving rise to micronuclei, and regulate the exit from the G2 checkpoint. At the G1 phase, only the regularly spliced form of p53 caused growth arrrest. In contrast, both the regularly and the alternatively spliced p53 forms directed postmitotic micronucleated cells towards apoptosis. These results provide a functional explanation for the cell cycle-independent expression of p53 in mnormal cycling cells, as well as in cells where p53 is up-regulated, following DNA damage."

https://openalex.org/W2323054544,"In the present work we studied mechanisms of growth control in contact-inhibited and serum-deprived human diploid fibroblasts. The observation that the effects on [3H]thymidine incorporation and reduction of retinoblastoma gene product-phosphorylation were additive when contact-inhibition and serum-deprivation were combined led us to the conclusion that the underlying mechanisms might be different. Both contact-inhibition and serum-deprivation led to a strong decrease of cdk4-kinase-activity and cdk2-phosphorylation at Thr 160, while the total amounts of cdk4 and cdk2 remained constant. In contact-inhibited cells, we revealed a strong protein accumulation of the cdk2-inhibitor p27 and a slight, but significant increase of the cdk4-inhibitor p16. In serum-deprived cells, the protein levels in p27 and p16 remained low. In contrast, we detected a rapid decrease of cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 which did not occur in contact-inhibited cells. These results indicate that serum-deprivation and contact-inhibition have different mechanisms although they affect the same pathway cyclin D-cdk4, pRB, cyclin E-cdk2."
https://openalex.org/W2315441528,"Wild type p53 expressed from a temperature-sensitive (ts p53) construct induces both G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the p53-negative J3D mouse T lymphoma line (Wang et al., 1995). Using differential display analysis, we have identified one new p53-induced gene, wig-1 (for wild type p53-induced gene 1), whose 7.6 kb and 2.2 kb transcripts are upregulated in ts p53-transfected J3D cells following induction of wild type p53 expression by temperature shift to 32 degrees C. The wig-1 transcripts were also induced in irradiated NIH3T3 and p21-/- fibroblasts but not in irradiated p53-/- fibroblasts. Whole body gamma irradiation caused induction of both wig-1 transcripts in mouse brain, testis, kidney, spleen and lung. A basal wig-1 expression was detected in brain, testis and kidney. The WIG-1 protein contains three zinc finger motifs and a putative nuclear localization signal."
https://openalex.org/W2334062824,"The transcriptional activator E2F1 regulates the expression of genes at the G1/S boundary. We have characterized interactions of the E2F1 activation domain with two general transcription factors, the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) and TFIIH. Two distinct binding sites on E2F1 were identified for TBP (amino acids 386 – 417 and 415 – 437) each of which supported activation in mammalian cells when expressed as a fusion to a heterologous DNA-binding domain. Neither of these minimal activation domains independently bound TFIIH; rather, the TFIIH binding site of E2F1 overlaps both domains. Loss of TFIIH-binding by E2F1 resulted in a 60 – 65% reduction in transactivation, suggesting that the E2F1/TFIIH interaction is important, but not essential, for transactivation. The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) binds directly to E2F1 and represses E2F1-mediated transactivation. We have demonstrated that recombinant Rb can compete with TBP and the p62 subunit of TFIIH for binding to immobilized E2F1. A tumorigenic form of Rb deficient in repressing E2F1-mediated transactivation is likewise deficient in displacing TBP from E2F1. We propose that competition between Rb and both TBP and TFIIH for binding to E2F1 is a mechanism by which Rb inhibits transactivation by E2F1."
https://openalex.org/W2329156618,"The multi tumor suppressor genes MTS1 (CDKN2 p16INK4A) and MTS2 (CDKN1, p15INK4B) located at 9p21-22 are inactivated in some human cancers via several mechanisms including deletion and hypermethylation. We have investigated the deletion and methylation status of MTS1 and MTS2 in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of both T-cell (17 cases) and B-cell phenotypes (29 cases), and p16INK4A and p15INK4B mRNA expression in 36 of these cases. Biallelic or monoallelic loss of both MTS1 and MTS2 was observed in 12 cases of B-ALL and nine cases of T-ALL. Two cases of T-ALL showed deletion of MTS1 but not MTS2. The 5′ CpG region of MTS2 was hypermethylated in 12 cases of precursor B-ALL and eight cases of T-ALL but no hypermethylation was found in the 5′ CpG region of MTS1. All cases with homozygous deletion of MTS1 or MTS2 had no or low levels of mRNA expression and similar low levels of expression were found in cases in which MTS2 was present but fully methylated. Thus hypermethylation of MTS2, in contrast to MTS1, is frequent in childhood ALL. Furthermore our data show that although inactivation of MTS1 by deletion is common, inactivation of MTS2 by a combination of deletion and hypermethylation is more frequent in both B-ALL (20/29, 69%) and T-ALL (17/17, 100%). This suggests that both MTS1 and MTS2 are important targets of the 9p21-22 deletion."

https://openalex.org/W2335683301,"The binding of insulin to its receptor initiates multiple signal transduction pathways regulating such diverse processes as proliferation, differentiation, glucose transport, and glycogen metabolism. The STAT-family of transcription factors has been demonstrated to play a critical role in gene induction by a variety of hemopoietic cytokines and hormones. Furthermore, constitutive activation of STATs is observed in transformed cells. Here we describe activation of a transcriptional complex binding to a consensus STAT-transcriptional element in response to insulin challenge. This complex is induced rapidly after tyrosine autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor, and is sustained for several hours. Supershift analysis of the insulin-induced complex reveals that it specifically contains the transcription factor Stat3. DAN binding of this complex is inhibited by pre-incubation with tyrosine, but not serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitors, whereas transcriptional activation is inhibited by both. Utilising a dominant negative mutant of p21ras we demonstrate that both insulin-induced Stat3 DNA-binding and also transactivation do not require p21ras. Furthermore, although previous studies have suggested a role for MAP kinases (ERKs) and PI-3K in STAT activation, utilising the specific MEK inhibitor PD098059 and the PI-3K inhibitor wortmannin, we demonstrate that activation of ERKs or PI-3K are not required for insulin induced Stat3 phosphorylation or transactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2312707238,"Mimosine (MIM) and aphidicolin (APH) are two agents frequently used in tissue culture-based experiments to achieve cell synchronization at late G1 and S phases. Following MIM or APH treatment of human cancer cell lines, a reversible growth arrest in late G1 and S phases of the cell cycle was correlated with moderate increases in p53 and p21 protein levels. Both p53-dependent and -independent increases in p21 were observed following treatment with either agent. However, a striking increase in p21 protein levels and a continuous elevation in both p53 and p21 protein levels were observed over 48 h after cells re-entered the cell cycle following the chemically-induced synchronization. In addition, the increase in p21 protein levels typically seen following treatment of cells with DNA damaging agents, was enhanced when cells were treated with genotoxic agents following MIM or APH synchronization. These findings suggest that caution should be exercised when interpreting results from experiments using cell synchronization agents, in particular, studies designed to investigate p53- and p21-regulatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2315187181,"Radicicol, an inhibitor of Src-family protein-tyrosine kinases, causes morphological reversion of v-src- and v-Ha-ras-transformed fibroblasts and arrest of the cell cycle at both the G1 and the G2 phases. Radicicol was found to inhibit the growth of several other oncogene-transformed cell lines and human carcinoma cell lines and to revert their cell morphology to be flat. In the radicicol-treated flat cells, actin stress fiber bundles were reorganized. Since this effect of radicicol on these cell lines was inhibited by cycloheximide, de novo protein synthesis is required for the morphological reversion. Screening of cellular proteins enhanced in response to radicicol by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis suggested that the amount of gelsolin, an actin regulatory protein, was distinctly increased upon radicicol treatment. Western blot and Northern blot analyses showed that radicicol enhanced transcription of the gelsolin gene in human carcinoma cell lines, as a result of which the amount of gelsolin was increased several folds. Injection with an anti-gelsolin antibody into cells and successive treatment with radicicol resulted in approximately 80% reduction of the number of flat cells with stress fibers in comparison with controls treated with an irrelevant antibody. These results show that elevated expression of gelsolin is associated, at least in part, with the suppression of transformation and the restoration of actin stress fibers in human carcinoma cells by radicicol."
https://openalex.org/W2325090247,"RAS interacts with multiple targets in the cell and controls at least two signaling pathways, one regulating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and the other controlling membrane ruffling formation. These two pathways appear to act synergistically to cause transformation. SCH 51344 is a pyrazolo-quinoline derivative identified based on its ability to derepress transformation sensitive alpha-actin promoter in RAS-transformed cells. Previous studies have shown that SCH 51344 is a potent inhibitor of RAS-transformation. However, SCH 51344 had very little effect on the activities of proteins in the ERK pathway, suggesting that it inhibits RAS-transformation by a novel mechanism. In this study, we show that SCH 51344 specifically blocks membrane ruffling induced by activated forms of H-RAS, K-RAS, N-RAS and RAC. Treatment of fibroblast cells with this compound had very little effect on RAS-mediated activation of ERK and JUN kinase activities. SCH 51344 was effective in inhibiting the anchorage-independent growth of Rat-2 fibroblast cells transformed by the three forms of oncogenic RAS and RAC V12. These results indicate that SCH 51344 inhibits a critical component of the membrane ruffling pathway downstream from RAC and suggest that targeting this pathway may be an effective approach to inhibit transformation by RAS and other oncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W2333352978,"Mice transgenic for the leukemia oncogene E2A-PBX1 invariably develop lethal, high-grade T-cell lymphomas by 5 months of age. In this study, retroviral insertional mutagenesis was employed to identify oncogenes that cooperate with the E2A-PBX1 transgene in lymphomagenesis. Neonatal retroviral infection substantially reduced length of survival due to accelerated development of lymphomas (81 versus 130 days). The Pim1 gene was targeted by retroviral insertions in 48% of accelerated lymphomas whereas less than 5% contained activated c-Myc and none contained activated Pim2. However, Pim1 DNA rearrangements were frequently sub-stoichiometric and not present at all sites of involvement in an otherwise monoclonal lymphoma indicating that Pim1 activation occurred late in the course of lymphomagenesis. Tumor subpopulations containing activated Pim1 alleles displayed a substantial growth advantage over Pim1 negative cells following serial transfer to secondary, syngeneic recipients. Cooperative interactions were observed in intercrossed Pim1 and E2A-PBX1 transgenic mice in which all double transgenic progeny developed lethal, diffuse T lineage lymphomas by 3 months of age, whereas only 13% of E2A-PBX1 and none of Pim1 single transgenic intercross progeny developed lymphomas by 1 year. Tumors from double transgenic mice were monoclonal providing evidence that additional genetic events were required for transformation. Therefore, Pim1 and E2a-Pbx1 cooperate in T lineage lymphomagenesis but they are not sufficient and the role of Pim1 is more likely to be associated with tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2323679634,"We have shown before that the N8 mRNA is expressed at higher levels in lung tumor and lung tumor-derived cell lines than normal lung cells. In this paper, we have characterized the N8 protein, and studied its properties. The N8 gene encodes a major 24 kDa protein and its expression correlates well with the N8 mRNA expression pattern observed in different cell lines. N8 protein is capable of forming a homodimer or multimeter in vitro. It is a phosphorylated cytoplasmic protein and phosphorylation occurs mainly at serine residues. N8 protein is expressed at higher levels in epithelial cells than in mesenchymal cells. N8 protein expression is induced in a fibroblast cell line expressing adenoviral E1a protein, which acquired epithelial-like characteristics. Furthermore, ectopic expression of N8 protein in NIH3T3 cells converts them into a spheroid form. These spheroids also have some of the characteristic features of epithelial cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the N8 protein may be associated with the development or maintenance of epithelial cell phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1965967958,"p27kip1 is a general inhibitor of Cdks that preferentially accumulates and functions during G1 phase, before the restriction point of the mammalian cell cycle. We observed that injection of purified p27kip1 into Xenopus oocytes potently inhibits the G2/M transition and activation/dephosphorylation of the maturation promoting factor (MPF, p34cdc2/cyclin B complex) kinase associated with germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) induced by progesterone or insulin. Addition of exogenous p27kip1 in vitro to lysates of hormonally matured oocytes blocked the enzymatic activity of the activated MPF kinase present in those extracts. Interestingly, the isolated amino-terminal region of p27kip1 (p27N), encompassing only the Cdk binding site, exhibited a similar inhibitory behavior in vitro and a weaker inhibitory effect in vivo than the complete p27kip1 protein. Surprisingly, the remaining carboxy-terminal region of p27kip1 (p27C) actually induced GVBD when injected alone into the oocytes, and also accelerated the kinetics of insulin- or progesterone-induced GVBD. Consistent with the in vivo observations, p27C formed a complex with, and activated, the MPF kinase in lysates of immature oocytes, although this activation was blocked by simultaneous addition of p27N or complete p27kip1. Active MPF was able to phosphorylate p27C only in the absence of p27N or whole p27kip1, suggesting that the inhibitory activity associated with the amino terminus is dominant over the activation produced by p27C. These results demonstrate the functional interaction of p27kip1 with cyclin B/p34cdc2 complexes during G2/M progression in oocytes, and suggest that the amino and carboxy terminal portions of this protein may play opposite regulatory roles, reminiscent of the corresponding N- and C-terminal portions of p21waf. We speculate that accumulation of a truncated, C-terminal p27 fragment may play a physiological regulatory role in progression through G2 and later stages of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1969704363,"Expression of oncogenic H-Ras in 23A2 myoblasts (A2:H-Ras cells) is sufficient to induce both a transformed phenotype and a differentiation-defective phenotype. Because oncogenic Ras is known to induce the secretion of several different growth factors involved in maintaining the transformed phenotype of both fibroblast and epithelial cells, we explored the possibility that expression of oncogenic Ras in 23A2 myoblasts might lead to the secretion of a factor which inhibits differentiation. The differentiation of 23A2 myoblasts was inhibited (i) by coculture with an equal number of A2:H-Ras cells, (ii) by culture with an equal number of A2:H-Ras cells in the same tissue culture medium on an insert which allowed equilibration of molecules smaller than 1 micron, and (iii) by culture in media previously conditioned by A2:H-Ras cells. Similar results were obtained when 23A2 myoblasts expressing oncogenic N-Ras were substituted for A2:H-Ras cells in each assay. No inhibition of differentiation was observed, however, when differentiation-defective E1A-expressing 23A2 cells or C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were substituted for A2:H-Ras cells. The differentiation inhibitor(s) in media conditioned by A2:H-Ras cells is heat stable, larger than 3 kD, and sensitive to the non-specific growth factor antagonist, suramin. Western analyses failed to detect either FGF-2 or TGFbeta (the known inhibitors of myoblast differentiation) in media conditioned by A2:H-Ras cells. Furthermore, while FGF-2 is a potent activator of MAP kinase and TGFbeta is a potent inhibitor of mink lung epithelial cell (CCL64) growth, conditioned media from A2:H-Ras cells does not activate MAP kinase and does not inhibit the growth of CCL64 cells. These results indicate that expression of oncogenic Ras induces the secretion of a novel inhibitor of skeletal myoblast differentiation. Furthermore, these results are the first to implicate an autocrine/paracrine mechanism in the inhibition of differentiation by oncogenic Ras."
