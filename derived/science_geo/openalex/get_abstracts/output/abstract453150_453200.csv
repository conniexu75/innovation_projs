Mutations in the IDH1 and IDH2 genes are common in certain types of human cancer. Whether inhibition of mutant IDH activity might offer therapeutic benefits is unclear (see the Perspective by Kim and DeBerardinis ). F. Wang et al. (p. 622 , published online 4 April) isolated a small molecule that selectively inhibits mutant IDH2, describe the structural details of its binding to the mutant enzyme, and show that this compound suppresses the growth of patient-derived leukemia cells harboring the IDH2 mutation. Rohle et al. (p. 626 , published online 4 April) show that a small molecule inhibitor of IDH1 selectively slows the growth of patient-derived brain tumor cells with the IDH1 mutation."

https://openalex.org/W2049557857,"How Copper Clicks The copper-catalyzed coupling of azides and alkynes has been termed a “click” reaction on account of its efficiency and versatility, but despite its widespread use, the mechanism remains somewhat unclear. Through a series of kinetic and isotopic labeling studies, Worrell et al. (p. 457 , published online 4 April) show that, in the case of terminal alkynes (capped at one end by an H atom), two equivalents of copper participate in activating each molecule's reactivity toward azide. Surprisingly, the reaction also appears to proceed through an intermediate in which the two copper centers become equivalent and functionally exchangeable, despite initially coordinating to distinct sites on the alkyne."

Machine-learning–based analyses can decode the stimulus- and task-induced brain activity patterns that represent specific visual contents. Horikawa et al. (p. 639 , published online 4 April) examined patterns of brain activity during dreaming and compared these to waking responses to visual stimuli. The findings suggest that the visual content of dreams is represented by the same neural substrate as observed during awake perception."
https://openalex.org/W2026993081,"Formins are potent activators of actin filament assembly in the cytoplasm. In turn, cytoplasmic actin polymerization can promote release of actin from megakaryocytic acute leukemia (MAL) protein for serum response factor (SRF) transcriptional activity. We found that formins polymerized actin inside the mammalian nucleus to drive serum-dependent MAL-SRF activity. Serum stimulated rapid assembly of actin filaments within the nucleus in a formin-dependent manner. The endogenous formin mDia was regulated with an optogenetic tool, which allowed for photoreactive release of nuclear formin autoinhibition. Activated mDia promoted rapid and reversible nuclear actin network assembly, subsequent MAL nuclear accumulation, and SRF activity. Thus, a dynamic polymeric actin structure within the nucleus is part of the serum response."
https://openalex.org/W2024627126,"Quelccaya Ice Cap Ice cores drilled in the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica are some of the most important sources of information about the paleoclimate of high latitudes. Comparable records from the tropics are rare, however, because there are so few locations at which long-lived, undisturbed ice can be found. Thompson et al. (p. 945 , published online 4 April) report results obtained from one of the few such sites, the Quelccaya ice cap in the Peruvian Andes. The annually resolved data, extending back 1800 years, provide a detailed chronicle of changes in the isotopic composition of the oxygen in the ice, which are related to the sea surface temperature of the water's source. Analyses of a collection of major ions such as ammonium and nitrate reveal how atmospheric circulation in the region varied over that period. Finally, the radiocarbon content of ancient plants—recently exposed by the retreat of the ice sheet—reveals that Quelccaya has not been smaller for at least six thousand years."
https://openalex.org/W2031303523,"A plethora of algorithmic assemblers have been proposed for the de novo assembly of genomes, however, no individual assembler guarantees the optimal assembly for diverse species. Optimizing various parameters in an assembler is often performed in order to generate the most optimal assembly. However, few efforts have been pursued to take advantage of multiple assemblies to yield an assembly of high accuracy. In this study, we employ various state-of-the-art assemblers to generate different sets of contigs for bacterial genomes. A tool, named CISA, has been developed to integrate the assemblies into a hybrid set of contigs, resulting in assemblies of superior contiguity and accuracy, compared with the assemblies generated by the state-of-the-art assemblers and the hybrid assemblies merged by existing tools. This tool is implemented in Python and requires MUMmer and BLAST+ to be installed on the local machine. The source code of CISA and examples of its use are available at http://sb.nhri.org.tw/CISA/."
https://openalex.org/W2055523840,"This population-based birth cohort study examined whether normal weight obesity is associated with metabolic disorders in young adults in a middle-income country undergoing rapid nutrition transition.The sample involved 1,222 males and females from the 1978/79 Ribeirão Preto birth cohort, Brazil, aged 23-25 years. NWO was defined as body mass index (BMI) within the normal range (18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)) and the sum of subscapular and triceps skinfolds above the sex-specific 90th percentiles of the study sample. It was also defined as normal BMI and % BF (body fat) >23% in men and >30% in women. Insulin resistance (IR), insulin sensitivity and secretion were based on the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) model.In logistic models, after adjusting for age, sex and skin colour, NWO was significantly associated with Metabolic Syndrome (MS) according to the Joint Interim Statement (JIS) definition (Odds Ratio OR = 6.83; 95% Confidence Interval CI 2.84-16.47). NWO was also associated with HOMA2-IR (OR = 3.81; 95%CI 1.57-9.28), low insulin sensitivity (OR = 3.89; 95%CI 2.39-6.33), and high insulin secretion (OR = 2.17; 95%CI 1.24-3.80). Significant associations between NWO and some components of the MS were also detected: high waist circumference (OR = 8.46; 95%CI 5.09-14.04), low High Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (OR = 1.65; 95%CI 1.11-2.47) and high triglyceride levels (OR = 1.93; 95%CI 1.02-3.64). Most estimates changed little after further adjustment for early and adult life variables.NWO was associated with MS and IR, suggesting that clinical assessment of excess body fat in normal-BMI individuals should begin early in life even in middle-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W2018849212,"The human nasopharynx is the main reservoir for Streptococcus pneumoniae. We applied conventional and molecular methods to determine the prevalence of S. pneumoniae nasopharyngeal colonization in adults. Paired trans-orally and trans-nasally obtained nasopharyngeal samples from 268 parents of 24-month-old children were assessed for pneumococcal presence. Parents were classified as colonized when live pneumococci were recovered from either sample cultured on medium selective for S. pneumoniae. Of the 52 (19%) colonized parents 49 (18%) were culture-positive in trans-nasal and 10 (4%) in trans-oral samples. Bacterial growth was harvested from these cultures, DNA isolated and tested by quantitative-PCR (qPCR) targeting lytA and piaA genes specific for S. pneumoniae. A sample was considered positive if signals for both genes were detected. Altogether 105 (39%) individuals were classified as positive for pneumococcus by qPCR including 50 (19%) in trans-nasal and 94 (35%) in trans-oral settings. Although significantly more trans-nasal compared to trans-oral samples were culture-positive for S. pneumoniae at the primary diagnostic step (p<0.001) the opposite was observed in qPCR results (p<0.001). To confirm the presence of live pneumococcus in samples positive by qPCR but negative at the initial diagnostic step, we serially-diluted cell harvests, re-cultured and carefully examined for S. pneumoniae presence. Live pneumococci were recovered from an additional 43 parents including 42 positive in trans-oral and 4 in trans-nasal samples increasing the number of individuals culture- and qPCR-positive to 93 (35%) and positive by either of two methods to 107 (40%). There were significantly more trans-oral than trans-nasal samples positive for pneumococcus by both culture and qPCR (n = 71; 27%; vs. n = 50; 19%; p<0.05). Our data suggest that pneumococcal colonization is more common in adults than previously estimated and point towards the superiority of a trans-oral over a trans-nasal approach when testing adults for colonization with S. pneumoniae."
https://openalex.org/W2052094121,"The microbial deconstruction of the plant cell wall is a key biological process that is of increasing importance with the development of a sustainable biofuel industry. The glycoside hydrolase families GH5 (PaMan5A) and GH26 (PaMan26A) endo-β-1,4-mannanases from the coprophilic ascomycete Podospora anserina contribute to the enzymatic degradation of lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, P. anserina mannanases were further subjected to detailed comparative analysis of their substrate specificities, active site organization, and transglycosylation capacity. Although PaMan5A displays a classical mode of action, PaMan26A revealed an atypical hydrolysis pattern with the release of mannotetraose and mannose from mannopentaose resulting from a predominant binding mode involving the -4 subsite. The crystal structures of PaMan5A and PaMan26A were solved at 1.4 and 2.85 Å resolution, respectively. Analysis of the PaMan26A structure supported strong interaction with substrate at the -4 subsite mediated by two aromatic residues Trp-244 and Trp-245. The PaMan26A structure appended to its family 35 carbohydrate binding module revealed a short and proline-rich rigid linker that anchored together the catalytic and the binding modules."
https://openalex.org/W2090437352,"Obesity is associated with elevated serum transaminase levels and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and weight loss is a recommended therapeutic strategy. Bariatric surgery is effective in obtaining and maintaining weight loss. Aim of the present study was to examine the long-term effects of bariatric surgery on transaminase levels in obese individuals.The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study is a prospective controlled intervention study designed to compare the long-term effects of bariatric surgery and usual care in obese subjects. A total of 3,570 obese participants with no excess of alcohol consumption at baseline (1,795 and 1,775 in the control and surgery group, respectively) were included in the analyses. Changes in transaminase levels during follow-up were compared in the surgery and control groups.Compared to usual care, bariatric surgery was associated with lower serum ALT and AST levels at 2- and 10- year follow up. The reduction in ALT levels was proportional to the degree of weight loss. Both the incidence of and the remission from high transaminase levels were more favorable in the surgery group compared to the control group. Similarly, the prevalence of ALT/AST ratio <1 was lower in the surgery compared to the control group at both 2- and 10-year follow up.Bariatric surgery results in a sustained reduction in transaminase levels and a long-term benefit in obese individuals."
https://openalex.org/W1983544591,"Background Pancreatic neuritis is a histopathological hallmark of pancreatic neuropathy and correlates to abdominal neuropathic pain sensation in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) and chronic pancreatitis (CP). However, inflammatory cell subtypes that compose pancreatic neuritis and their correlation to the neuropathic pain syndrome in PCa and CP are yet unknown. Methods Inflammatory cells within pancreatic neuritis lesions of patients with PCa (n = 20) and CP (n = 20) were immunolabeled and colorimetrically quantified with the pan-leukocyte marker CD45, with CD68 (macrophages), CD8 (cytotoxic T-lymphocytes), CD4 (T-helper cells), CD20 (B-lymphocytes), NCL-PC (plasma cells), neutrophil elastase, PRG2 (eosinophils), anti-mast cell (MC) tryptase and correlated to pain sensation. Perineural mast cell subtypes were analyzed by double immunolabeling with MC chymase. Expression and neural immunoreactivity of protease-activated receptor type 1 (PAR-1) and type 2 (PAR-2) were analyzed in PCa and CP and correlated to pain status of the patients. Results In PCa and CP, nerves were predominantly infiltrated by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (PCa: 35% of all perineural inflammatory cells, CP: 33%), macrophages (PCa: 39%, CP: 33%) and MC (PCa: 21%, CP: 27%). In both entities, neuropathic pain sensation was associated with a specific increase of perineural MC (PCa without pain: 14% vs. PCa with pain: 31%; CP without pain: 19% vs. CP with pain: 34%), not affecting the frequency of other inflammatory cell subtypes. The vast majority of these MC contained MC chymase. PAR-1 and PAR-2 expression did not correlate to the pain sensation of PCa and CP patients. Conclusion Pancreatic neuritis in PC and CP is composed of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, macrophages and MC. The specific enrichment of MC around intrapancreatic nerves in neuropathic pain due to PCa and CP suggests the presence of MC-induced visceral hypersensitivity in the pancreas. Therefore, pancreatic and enteric neuropathies seem to share a similar type of neuro-immune interaction in the generation of visceral pain."

Other acceptors of flavins in flavoproteins include His, Tyr, and Cys residues that form C-N, C-O, and C-S bonds, respectively, mostly through the 8αC atom of the flavin (e.g., in succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate reductase, sarcosine oxidase, trimethylamine dehydrogenase, and p-cresol methylhydroxylase) (18Heuts D.P.

Heterologous expression of the Vibrio cholerae nqrC gene in Escherichia coli results in production of a flavin-deficient apo-form of NqrC (22Barquera B. Häse C.C. Gennis R.B.

Similar results have been recently obtained for Shewanella oneidensis urdA expressed in E. coli (17Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Bloch D.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Urocanate reductase.

Although Na+-NQR subunits NqrB and NqrC and related FMN-binding proteins have completely different overall primary and tertiary structures (23Yeats C. Bentley S. Bateman A. New knowledge from old. In silico discovery of novel protein domains in Streptomyces coelicolor.BMC Microbiol. 2003; 3: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), they contain a common pattern around the FMN-carrying Thr residue (Fig. 1) reminiscent of a motif for a post-translational modification. In the present work, we identified the missing protein factor that recognizes this pattern and present evidence that it is a novel specific enzyme, flavin transferase. The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae cells were routinely grown in LB medium at 37 °C. K. pneumoniae cells were grown in the presence of the antibiotics ampicillin at 150 μg/ml, tetracycline at 3.3 μg/ml, kanamycin at 100 μg/ml, and chloramphenicol at 40 μg/ml. The concentrations of these antibiotics used for E. coli were 100, 10, 50, and 20 μg/ml, respectively.

The gene sequence encoding the truncated NqrC subunit, NqrC′ (a soluble variant of NqrC without its N-terminal transmembrane α-helix), was amplified by PCR with Taq polymerase and primers sh_nqrC_dir and nqrC_rev (see Table 1) using the genomic DNA of Vibrio harveyi as a template. The amplified 706-bp fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), resulting in the pSHC221 plasmid. The NcoI-EcoRI fragment of this plasmid was subcloned into the pBAD/Myc-His A vector (Invitrogen) treated with the NcoI and EcoRI restriction enzymes, resulting in plasmid pMshC3. This plasmid was used to produce truncated NqrC subunit with a C-terminal His6 tag. An expression vector for C-terminally His6-tagged ApbE protein devoid of its leader sequence (ApbE′) was constructed by amplifying the DNA fragment of apbE without its leader sequence by PCR with a Tersus PCR kit and the primers CM_ApbE_dir and CM_ApbE_rev (see Table 1) using the genomic DNA of V. cholerae as a template. The resulting 966-bp fragment was cloned into the pAL-TA vector (Evrogen), yielding the pAL_CM14 plasmid. The NcoI-HindIII fragment of this plasmid was subcloned into the pBAD/Myc-His A vector digested by the same restriction nucleases, resulting in plasmid pB_CM1. In addition, the part of this plasmid containing pUC ori and ApR was replaced by the EcoRV-BsaBI fragment of the pACYC184 vector containing p15A ori and CmR, resulting in plasmid p15BCM7. The plasmid pΔhis3, bearing the gene encoding ApbE′ protein without the His6 tag, was produced by treating the p15BCM7 plasmid with HindIII and self-ligating the resulting 4805-bp fragment. This procedure resulted in removal of the 753-bp fragment containing the His6 tag sequence and creation of a stop codon in the proper place in the apbE′ gene. The K. pneumoniae genome contains two genes encoding ApbE-like proteins, ApbE1 (YP_002237370) and ApbE2 (YP_002238733) (Fig. 2). Because ApbE1 is more similar to ApbE-like proteins from other Gammaproteobacteria (see below), its gene was used as the target for mutagenesis. The DNA fragment containing the apbE1 gene was amplified by PCR with Taq polymerase and primers Kpn_ApbE_dir and Kpn_ApbE_rev (see Table 1) using the genomic DNA of K. pneumoniae 204 as a template. The amplified 2.7-kb fragment was cloned into the pAL-TA vector, resulting in the pAL_A8 plasmid. A kanamycin resistance cassette was inserted into the EcoRV site of the apbE1 gene in pAL_A8, and a Km-containing plasmid (pALAK7) bearing the apbE1 gene together with the unidirectionally transcribing kanamycin resistance cassette was selected. The apbE1::Km fragment from pALAK7 was subcloned into the suicide vector pKNOCK-Tc, resulting in pKn_ApbE1::Km3. This plasmid was transferred into the K. pneumoniae KNU210 (nuoB::Cm) (24Bertsova Y.V. Bogachev A.V. The origin of the sodium-dependent NADH oxidation by the respiratory chain of Klebsiella pneumoniae.FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) strain via conjugation using E. coli SM10λpir as the donor, and a TcS KmR CmR phenotype clone (KNUAE11 nuoB::Cm, apbE1::Km) characteristic of a double-crossover-introduced mutation was selected. Proper localization of the mutation in the K. pneumoniae chromosome was verified by PCR analysis. The disruption of apbE1 did not result in a thiamine auxotrophic phenotype in the K. pneumoniae KNUAE11 strain when tested in M9 medium supplemented with glucose, as described previously for Salmonella enterica (25Beck B.J. Downs D.M. A periplasmic location is essential for the role of the ApbE lipoprotein in thiamine synthesis in Salmonella typhimurium.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7285-7290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apbE1-containing DNA fragment was amplified by PCR with the high fidelity Tersus PCR kit (Evrogen) and primers Kpn_ApbE_dir and Kpn_ApbE_rev (Table 1) using the genomic DNA of K. pneumoniae 204 as a template. The amplified 2.7-kb fragment was cloned into the pAL-TA vector, resulting in the pATAE15 plasmid. K. pneumoniae KNUAE11 cells were transformed with the pATAE15 plasmid using electroporation. Na+-NQR content was increased by growing K. pneumoniae cells in M9 medium supplemented with sodium succinate as the sole energy and carbon source (26Fadeeva M.S. Yakovtseva E.A. Belevich G.A. Bertsova Y.V. Bogachev A.V. Regulation of expression of Na+-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase genes in Vibrio harveyiKlebsiella pneumoniae.Arch. Microbiol. 2007; 188: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min) and washed twice with medium 1 (100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgSO4, pH 8.0). The cell pellet was suspended in medium 2 (10 mm HEPES-Tris, 5 mm MgSO4, 50 mm KCl, pH 8.0), and the suspension was passed through a French press (16,000 p.s.i.). Undamaged cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 22,500 × g (10 min), and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 180,000 × g (60 min). The membrane pellet was suspended in medium 2 (at 20–30 mg of protein ml−1) and immediately used for activity measurements. NADH and dNADH oxidation by membrane vesicles isolated from K. pneumoniae strains were measured at 30 °C using a Hitachi 557 spectrophotometer at 340 nm. The reaction medium contained 20 mm HEPES-Tris, 5 mm MgSO4, and 100 mm KCl or NaCl (pH 8.0). For measurement of dNADH:menadione oxidoreductase activity, the reaction medium was supplemented with 50 μm menadione. The extinction coefficient, ϵ340, of 6.22 mm−1 cm−1 was used for NADH and dNADH quantitation. For nqrC′, apbE′, or urdA induction, E. coli cells bearing the appropriate plasmid(s) were grown at 32 °C to mid-exponential phase (A600 = 0.3–0.4), after which the growth medium was supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) l-arabinose, and cells were grown for additional 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min) and washed twice with medium containing 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 5 mm MgSO4 (pH 8.0). The cell pellet was suspended in medium containing 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm imidazole HCl (pH 8.0), and the suspension was passed twice through a French press (16,000 p.s.i.). Cell debris and membrane vesicles were removed by centrifugation at 180,000 × g (60 min). His6-tagged proteins were purified from the supernatant using affinity chromatography. This was accomplished by loading the supernatant onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated with solution A containing 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 5 mm imidazole HCl (pH 8.0); washing the column twice, first with solution A containing 10 mm imidazole HCl and then with solution A containing 20 mm imidazole HCl; and eluting His6-tagged proteins with solution A containing 100 mm imidazole HCl. The protein obtained was concentrated and kept frozen at −80 °C until use. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (27Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Measurement of protein using bicinchoninic acid.Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18579) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Covalently and noncovalently bound flavins in the holoNqrC′ protein were assayed as described by Casutt et al. (28Casutt M.S. Schlosser A. Buckel W. Steuber J. The single NqrB and NqrC subunits in the Na+-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) from Vibrio cholerae each carry one covalently attached FMN.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1817: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The protein (3 mg) was precipitated with 7.5% (v/v) TFA, sedimented by centrifugation, and washed with H2O (0 °C). The supernatants were combined, neutralized by adding 0.8 m K2HPO4, and passed through a Microcon YM-10 centrifugal filter (Millipore). The filtrate was used for determination of flavins noncovalently bound to holoNqrC′. Covalently bound flavins were released from the protein pellet by alkaline hydrolysis. To this end, an ice-cold 0.5 m LiOH solution (0.2 ml) was added to the pellet, and the mixture was vortexed and incubated on ice for 24 h. After the incubation, the suspension was neutralized by adding 1 m MES and passed through a Microcon YM-10 centrifugal filter. The filtrate was subjected to reverse phase HPLC using a Prontosil 120–5 C18 column (75 × 2 mm). A linear gradient of methanol (total sweep from 10 to 70% (v/v)s, 25 min) in 5 mm MES-Tris (pH 6.0) with the flow rate of 0.1 ml/min was used. Flavins were detected at 360 nm. Mass spectra were recorded on an Ultraflex Extreme MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with a neodymium laser. Aliquots of the sample were mixed on a steel target with a solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (20 mg/ml) in 30% (v/v) acetonitrile (Aldrich) with 0.5% (v/v) TFA. The [MH]+ molecular ions were analyzed in linear (proteins) or reflector (peptides) mode; the values of m/z were accurate to 30 ppm. Fragment ion spectra were obtained in Lift mode with a mass accuracy of better than 1 Da. The apoNqrC′ protein (4 mg/ml) was incubated for 45 min at 30 °C in medium containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm FAD or FMN, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in the presence or absence of 0.1 mg/ml ApbE′ and/or 5 mm MgSO4. After the incubation, the reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed using 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels (29Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206989) Google Scholar). Covalently bound flavins were detected by photographing gels under UV illumination with a GelDoc-It M-26XV gel documentation system using a SYBR Green emission filter. Bacterial genes are known to often cluster according to their functions (30Lawrence J. Selfish operons. The evolutionary impact of gene clustering in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), a feature that facilitates identification of functionally coupled proteins (31Rentzsch R. Orengo C.A. Protein function prediction. The power of multiplicity.Trends Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 210-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Genome context analysis of the nqr operons in marine bacteria of the genus Vibrio, a popular source of Na+-NQR, revealed the gene apbE, encoding the putative “alternative pyrimidine biosynthesis” protein ApbE, immediately downstream of the nqr operon in all Vibrio species with known genome sequences (Fig. 2). In contrast to this conservation at downstream positions, upstream positions are occupied by a variety of genes. This same regularity holds throughout the entire set of ∼1600 sequenced bacterial genomes, most of which, primarily proteobacteria, contain the apbE gene adjacent to the nqr operon. In the genomes of Na+-NQR-containing bacteria of the Chlamydiae/Verrucomicrobia group, Deferribacteres, Fusobacteria, Spirochaetes, Thermotogae, and some enterobacteria (e.g., K. pneumoniae), the apbE gene is also invariably present, but at more distant positions from the nqr operon (Fig. 2). Thus, all nqr-containing bacterial genomes contain the apbE gene, which is most commonly adjacent to the nqr operon. Similarly, the genomes of bacteria containing a homologous RNF complex with covalently bound FMN residues as prosthetic groups (15Backiel J. Juárez O. Zagorevski D.V. Wang Z. Nilges M.J. Barquera B. Covalent binding of flavins to RnfG and RnfD in the Rnf complex from Vibrio cholerae.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 11273-11284Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) always carry an apbE gene (Fig. 2), which is frequently located adjacent to the rnf operon; sometimes proteins containing an ApbE-like domain are even designated RnfF (12Schmehl M. Jahn A. Meyer zu Vilsendorf A. Hennecke S. Masepohl B. Schuppler M. Marxer M. Oelze J. Klipp W. Identification of a new class of nitrogen fixation genes in Rhodobacter capsulatus. A putative membrane complex involved in electron transport to nitrogenase.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 602-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We found only one exception to this rule: some species of the genus Buchnera (obligate endosymbionts of aphids) possess the full rnf operon, but their apbE genes contain an authentic frameshift. The nqr and rnf operons are thus genetically coupled to apbE, suggesting a functional link between the Na+-NQR (RNF) and ApbE proteins. Even when an apbE-like gene is clustered in bacterial genomes with genes for proteins other than NqrB, NqrC, RnfD, and RnfG, their encoded proteins are also often shown or predicted to contain a covalently bound FMN residue. Such examples include the FMN-containing NosR protein (Pden_4220) and ApbE-like protein NosX (Pden_4214) of Paracoccus denitrificans; the presumptive FMN-containing UrdA-like urocanate reductases (Shal_2847, Ssed_0694, and ZP_02156482) and ApbE-like proteins (Shal_2846, Ssed_0695, and ZP_02156483) of Shewanella halifaxensis, Shewanella sediminis, and Shewanella benthica KT99, respectively; and the FAD/FMN-binding/flavocytochrome c (KPK_2907) and ApbE-like protein (KPK_2905) of K. pneumoniae (Fig. 2). In addition, there are several examples in genomic databases where the genes of an ApbE-like protein and a putative FMN-binding protein are fused, resulting in one elongated gene (CAJ73234, ZP_03630453, and ZP_10101304). The above analysis suggested that the ApbE protein is the sought-after “flavin-attaching” enzyme. To test this hypothesis, we measured the effect of co-expressing V. harveyi nqrC and V. cholerae apbE in E. coli cells on flavin incorporation into NqrC. As originally reported by Barquera et al. (22Barquera B. Häse C.C. Gennis R.B. Expression and mutagenesis of the NqrC subunit of the NQR respiratory Na+ pump from Vibrio cholerae with covalently attached FMN.FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), heterologous expression of the V. cholerae nqrC gene in E. coli cells results in the production of flavin-deficient NqrC. A similar result was obtained in the present work using a truncated V. harveyi NqrC (NqrC′) protein in which the N-terminal transmembrane α-helix was eliminated by genetic manipulations to make NrqC water-soluble. The NqrC′ protein isolated from E. coli/pMshC3 cells showed no bands characteristic of bound flavin in absorption spectra (Fig. 3A, red line), and no fluorescent band was detected in SDS-PAGE analyses (Fig. 4A, lane 1).FIGURE 4SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant NqrC′ and UrdA′ proteins purified from different E. coli strains. A and C, unstained gels under UV illumination; B and D, Coomassie Blue-stained gels. Lanes 1 and 2 are NqrC′ isolated from E. coli/pMshC3 strain (nqrC′ only) and E. coli/pMshC3 + pΔhis3 strain (nqrC′ + apbE′), respectively.

This study compared the effects of dried plum on bone to other dried fruits and further explored the potential mechanisms of action through which dried plum may exert its osteoprotective effects. Adult osteopenic ovariectomized (OVX) C57BL/6 mice were fed either a control diet or a diet supplemented with 25% (w/w) dried plum, apple, apricot, grape or mango for 8 weeks. Whole body and spine bone mineral density improved in mice consuming the dried plum, apricot and grape diets compared to the OVX control mice, but dried plum was the only fruit to have an anabolic effect on trabecular bone in the vertebra and prevent bone loss in the tibia. Restoration of biomechanical properties occurred in conjunction with the changes in trabecular bone in the spine. Compared to other dried fruits in this study, dried plum was unique in its ability to down-regulate osteoclast differentiation coincident with up-regulating osteoblast and glutathione (GPx) activity. These alterations in bone metabolism and antioxidant status compared to other dried fruits provide insight into dried plum's unique effects on bone."

Although accumulating evidence suggests the involvement of RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) in TDP-43 proteinopathy, it remains unclear how native TDP-43 is converted to pathogenic forms. To elucidate the role of homeostasis of RRM1 structure in ALS pathogenesis, conformations of RRM1 under high pressure were monitored by NMR. We first found that RRM1 was prone to aggregation and had three regions showing stable chemical shifts during misfolding. Moreover, mass spectrometric analysis of aggregated RRM1 revealed that one of the regions was located on protease-resistant β-strands containing two cysteines (Cys-173 and Cys-175), indicating that this region served as a core assembly interface in RRM1 aggregation. Although a fraction of RRM1 aggregates comprised disulfide-bonded oligomers, the substitution of cysteine(s) to serine(s) (C/S) resulted in unexpected acceleration of amyloid fibrils of RRM1 and disulfide-independent aggregate formation of full-length TDP-43. Notably, TDP-43 aggregates with RRM1-C/S required the C terminus, and replicated cytopathologies of ALS, including mislocalization, impaired RNA splicing, ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and motor neuron toxicity. Furthermore, RRM1-C/S accentuated inclusions of familial ALS-linked TDP-43 mutants in the C terminus.

https://openalex.org/W2083656186,"A bacterial transcriptome of the primary etiological agent of human dental caries, Streptococcus mutans, is described here using deep RNA sequencing. Differential expression profiles of the transcriptome in the context of carbohydrate source, and of the presence or absence of the catabolite control protein CcpA, revealed good agreement with previously-published DNA microarrays. In addition, RNA-seq considerably expanded the repertoire of DNA sequences that showed statistically-significant changes in expression as a function of the presence of CcpA and growth carbohydrate. Novel mRNAs and small RNAs were identified, some of which were differentially expressed in conditions tested in this study, suggesting that the function of the S. mutans CcpA protein and the influence of carbohydrate sources has a more substantial impact on gene regulation than previously appreciated. Likewise, the data reveal that the mechanisms underlying prioritization of carbohydrate utilization are more diverse than what is currently understood. Collectively, this study demonstrates the validity of RNA-seq as a potentially more-powerful alternative to DNA microarrays in studying gene regulation in S. mutans because of the capacity of this approach to yield a more precise landscape of transcriptomic changes in response to specific mutations and growth conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1979338972,"Vancomycin-resistance in enterococci (VRE) is associated with isolates within ST18, ST17, ST78 Enterococcus faecium (Efm) and ST6 Enterococcus faecalis (Efs) human adapted lineages. Despite of its global spread, vancomycin resistance rates in enterococcal populations greatly vary temporally and geographically. Portugal is one of the European countries where Tn1546 (vanA) is consistently found in a variety of environments. A comprehensive multi-hierarchical analysis of VRE isolates (75 Efm and 29 Efs) from Portuguese hospitals and aquatic surroundings (1996-2008) was performed to clarify the local dynamics of VRE. Clonal relatedness was established by PFGE and MLST while plasmid characterization comprised the analysis of known relaxases, rep initiator proteins and toxin-antitoxin systems (TA) by PCR-based typing schemes, RFLP comparison, hybridization and sequencing. Tn1546 variants were characterized by PCR overlapping/sequencing. Intra- and inter-hospital dissemination of Efm ST18, ST132 and ST280 and Efs ST6 clones, carrying rolling-circle (pEFNP1/pRI1) and theta-replicating (pCIZ2-like, Inc18, pHTβ-like, two pRUM-variants, pLG1-like, and pheromone-responsive) plasmids was documented. Tn1546 variants, mostly containing ISEf1 or IS1216, were located on plasmids (30-150 kb) with a high degree of mosaicism and heterogeneous RFLP patterns that seem to have resulted from the interplay between broad host Inc18 plasmids (pIP501, pRE25, pEF1), and narrow host RepA_N plasmids (pRUM, pAD1-like). TAs of Inc18 (ω-ε-ζ) and pRUM (Axe-Txe) plasmids were infrequently detected. Some plasmid chimeras were persistently recovered over years from different clonal lineages. This work represents the first multi-hierarchical analysis of VRE, revealing a frequent recombinatorial diversification of a limited number of interacting clonal backgrounds, plasmids and transposons at local scale. These interactions provide a continuous process of parapatric clonalization driving a full exploration of the local adaptive landscape, which might assure long-term maintenance of resistant clones and eventually fixation of Tn1546 in particular geographic areas."
https://openalex.org/W2084761882,"The accumulation of cadmium, copper and zinc and the induction of metallothioneins (MT) in liver of three freshwater fish species was studied. Gudgeon (Gobio gobio), roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis) were captured at 6 sampling sites along a cadmium and zinc gradient and one reference site in a tributary of the Scheldt River in Flanders (Belgium). At each site up to 10 individuals per species were collected and analyzed on their general condition factor (K), hepatosomatic index (HSI) and gonadosomatic index (GSI). From each individual fish the liver was dissected and analyzed on Cd, Cu and Zn and MT-content. Although not all species were present at each site, hepatic Cd and Zn levels generally followed the pollution gradient and highest levels were measured in perch, followed by roach and gudgeon. Nevertheless also an effect of site was observed on this order. MT-levels appeared to be the highest in gudgeon although differences with the other species were not very pronounced and depended on the site. Significant relationships were found between hepatic zinc accumulation and MT levels. For each species the ratio MT(theoretical)/ MT(measured) was calculated, which gives an indication of the relative capacity to induce MTs and thus immobilize the metals. Perch had the lowest capacity in inducing MTs (highest ratio). Relationships between hepatic metal levels and fish condition indices were absent or very weak."
https://openalex.org/W2029977177,"Nearly one million Americans suffer a myocardial infarction each year, many of whom progress to heart failure, the single most common hospital discharge diagnosis in those over age 65 (ref. 1). The adult human heart has a limited regenerative response to injury such that the loss or dysfunction of cardiomyocytes results in reduced pump function, often culminating in heart failure, life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden death. Numerous clinical trials over the past decade have introduced a variety of autologous stem and progenitor cell types into failing human hearts as a strategy for regenerating new myocardium, but exogenous stem cells seem to give rise to few if any new muscle cells, bringing into question the biological basis for the limited functional improvement. Thus, there is still a dire need for innovative strategies for heart regeneration and repair.

A series of recent studies in rodents has reported the ability of exogenous transcription factors and miRNAs to reprogram cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes2–6, resulting in dramatic improvement of cardiac contractility after myocardial infarction2,3,6. Much work remains to optimize such reprogramming methods and to define the mechanistic basis for functional improvement in this setting, but this initial evidence suggests a potentially transformative new approach for heart repair.

Whereas skeletal and smooth muscle cells can be generated from fibroblasts by ectopic expression of single transcription factors7,8, the cardiac muscle phenotype has proven more elusive, as no single factor has been shown to be capable of generating cardiomyocytes from fibroblasts. An important step toward possible therapeutic generation of cardiomyocytes was provided by Ieda et al.9, who showed that three transcription factors—Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (together referred to as GMT)—could activate cardiac gene expression in cultured mouse fibroblasts with a low efficiency of between 5 and 15%. Activation of cardiac genes by these factors seems to require precise levels of expression of the factors. Inclusion of a fourth factor, Hand2, in the GMT cocktail substantially increases reprogramming efficiency2. Several cardiac miRNAs have also been reported to activate cardiac gene expression in fibroblasts with low efficiency4. Because cardiac transcription factors and miRNAs function within complex regulatory networks involving feed-forward and autoregulatory interactions, it is likely that multiple combinations of these cardiac regulators may initiate the cardiac phenotype.

Reprogramming by cardiac transcription factors and miRNAs seems to involve direct conversion of fibroblasts toward a cardiomyocyte-like fate without transition through a stem cell intermediate. This approach therefore differs from reprogramming methods that involve the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells and subsequent commitment to the cardiac lineage. Direct cardiac reprogramming of fibroblasts also circumvents potential teratogenicity and immunogenicity of induced pluripotent stem cells.

Induced cardiac-like myocytes (iCLMs) seem to be relatively immature, and only a very low fraction show action potentials and strong contractility, well-developed sarcomeres, and binucleation, characteristics of adult cardiomyocytes. Thus, maturation to adult cardiac phenotypes may require prolonged periods in culture or additional factors not yet identified. Initial efforts to reprogram human fibroblasts to a cardiac fate have recently found a set of at least five factors different from the factor combination in mouse fibroblasts that can activate cardiac gene expression in adult human cardiac and dermal fibroblasts and in neonatal human foreskin fibroblasts10. Cardiac reprogramming of human fibroblasts is slower and less efficient than in mouse fibroblasts, perhaps reflecting stable epigenetic events that need to be overcome.

Nearly half of the cells in the heart are fibroblasts, and their activation during heart disease leads to fibrosis, which impedes contractility and contributes to conduction abnormalities. Thus, targeting activated cardiac fibroblasts after injury to induce heart repair is particularly attractive (Fig. 1). Retroviruses, which infect only proliferating cells, were used to introduce GMT and GHMT into fibroblasts in the infarct zone of mice after myocardial infarction2,3,5. Lineage-tracing studies with fibroblast markers indicated that newly generated iCLMs were derived from fibroblasts.

There are a few aspects of these studies that warrant consideration. First, the reprogramming efficiency in vivo seems to be higher compared to in vitro, suggesting that the milieu of the intact heart may favor reprogramming in ways that cannot be reproduced in culture. Second, introduction of reprogramming factors results in dramatic functional improvement after myocardial infarction2,3, indicating that, at least in mice, the impact of cardiac reprogramming exceeds the relatively modest and transient effects observed with autologous stem cell transplantation. Finally, the extent of functional improvement after in vivo reprogramming is greater than expected, given the relatively modest number of mature cardiomyocytes generated. This may suggest that reprogramming factors enhance cardiac function through mechanisms beyond simply reprogramming of fibroblasts toward a cardiomyocyte cell fate, perhaps also promoting neoangiogenesis, preventing cardiomyocyte death and/or inhibiting fibroblast proliferation.

Although these initial studies point to a potentially promising new approach for heart repair, numerous technical and biological hurdles remain to be overcome. The efficiency of the reprogramming process remains relatively low, and reprogrammed cells show a spectrum of intermediate phenotypes, reflecting incomplete conversion to a mature cardiac phenotype. The latter issue is of concern, given the propensity of arrhythmias to arise from zones of cardiomyocyte heterogeneity11. The long-term stability and integration of reprogrammed cardiomyocytes with native cardiomyocytes also remains to be shown. Further optimization of reprogramming of human fibroblasts and demonstration of the therapeutic efficacy and safety of this approach in large animals is needed.

Cells from the cardiac conduction system and vasculature are also lost after cardiac injury, and full restoration of cardiac function after injury will therefore require recreation of multiple cell types. Smooth muscle, endothelial and angioblast-like progenitor cells have been efficiently generated by reprogramming8,12,13 and inclusion of a vascular endothelial growth factor–expressing virus with GMT enhances functional recovery of mice after myocardial infarction, possibly through neovascularization of the injured myocardium6. In addition, forced expression of Tbx3, activated Notch or Tbx18 in working cardiomyocytes is sufficient to generate conduction system cells in vitro14–16 and in vivo16.

Reprogramming experiments in rodents requires open chest surgery to directly inject viruses into the infarct zone; in humans, direct delivery of reprogramming factors during coronary artery bypass graft surgery could be a starting point. Given the potential for teratogenic viral insertions in the genome, as well as other complications associated with viral delivery, it will be important to develop nonintegrative methods for safe clinical application. Replacing cardiogenic transcription factors with small molecules or synthetic oligonucleotides with cardiogenic activity has long-term therapeutic possibilities; their combination with catheter-based delivery during a percutaneous coronary artery intervention after myocardial infarction could also reach widespread and effective use for intervention after heart attack.

Whereas studies thus far have been limited to the reprogramming of fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes within the infarct zone of hearts after myocardial infarction, it will be of interest to determine whether this approach can also be applied to other forms of acquired and inherited forms of heart disease associated with loss or dysfunction of cardiomyocytes. As most heart diseases are associated with an increase in cardiac fibrosis, this approach may extend beyond post–myocardial infarction therapy. Given our desperate need for entirely new heart repair strategies, further studies are warranted to resolve the current challenges facing in vivo reprogramming approaches. Cellular reprogramming, perhaps in combination with biological scaffolds or other bioengineering strategies, has the potential to provide an alternative or complementary heart repair strategy to cell transplantation–based approaches, which have been in clinical trials for nearly a decade."
https://openalex.org/W2023054436,"The Biogents® Sentinel (BGS) trap is the standard tool to monitor adult Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae), the Asian tiger mosquito. BGS traps are commonly placed in residential properties during surveillance operations, but locations within properties may have significant differences in ambient light, temperature, and humidity (e.g. between a sunlit lawn and shady underbrush). We examined the effect of BGS trap placement on Ae. albopictus capture rates in three residential properties in Monmouth County, New Jersey, USA. In each property we visually selected locations as shade, partial shade, and sun. Traps in “partial shade” locations were under vegetation and were exposed to filtered sunlight during some parts of the day while “shaded” locations were never exposed to direct sunlight. Locations defined as “sun” were exposed to direct sunlight for large parts of the day. We placed a BGS trap in each of the three location types and used small data loggers to measure temperature, relative humidity, and light exposure at each trap during a 24-hour deployment. To address temporal variability, we made seven separate measurements from 31 August to 22 September 2010. We found that “partial shade” and “full shade” locations did not differ but that “full sun” locations had significantly higher light exposure, higher temperature, and lower humidity. Importantly, Ae. albopictus catches (males, females, or both) were consistently and significantly over 3 times higher in traps located in shaded locations. To further investigate the effects of local temperature and humidity on surveillance we examined Ae. albopictus collections from 37 BGS traps fitted with data loggers and deployed weekly from August through mid October, during the 2009 season, in three urban sites in Mercer County, NJ. We confirmed that local climate influences capture rates and that Ae. albopictus surveillance projects need to monitor trap placement carefully for maximum efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1981605516,"Breast cancer is a complex disease, with heterogeneous clinical evolution. Several analyses have been performed to identify the risk factors for breast cancer progression and the patients who respond best to a specific treatment. We aimed to evaluate whether the hormone receptor expression, HER2 and MYC genes and their protein status, and KRAS codon 12 mutations may be prognostic or predictive biomarkers of breast cancer. Protein, gene and mutation status were concomitantly evaluated in 116 breast tumors from women who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide. We observed that MYC expression was associated with luminal B and HER2 overexpression phenotypes compared to luminal A (p<0.05). The presence of MYC duplication or polysomy 8, as well as KRAS mutation, were also associated with the HER2 overexpression subtype (p<0.05). MYC expression and MYC gain were more frequently observed in early-onset compared to late-onset tumors (p<0.05). KRAS mutation was a risk factor of grade 3 tumors (p<0.05). A multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that MYC amplification defined as MYC/nucleus ratio of ≥2.5 was a protective factor for chemotherapy resistance. On the other hand, age and grade 2 tumors were a risk factor. Additionally, luminal B, HER2 overexpression, and triple-negative tumors presented increased odds of being resistant to chemotherapy relative to luminal A tumors. Thus, breast tumors with KRAS codon 12 mutations seem to present a worse prognosis. Additionally, MYC amplification may help in the identification of tumors that are sensitive to doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide treatment. If confirmed in a large set of samples, these markers may be useful for clinical stratification and prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2035336413,"The DEAD-box protein UAP56 (U2AF65-associcated protein) is an RNA helicase that in yeast and metazoa is critically involved in mRNA splicing and export. In Arabidopsis, two adjacent genes code for an identical UAP56 protein, and both genes are expressed. In case one of the genes is inactivated by a T-DNA insertion, wild type transcript level is maintained by the other intact gene. In contrast to other organisms that are severely affected by elevated UAP56 levels, Arabidopsis plants that overexpress UAP56 have wild type appearance. UAP56 localises predominantly to euchromatic regions of Arabidopsis nuclei, and associates with genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II independently from the presence of introns, while it is not detected at non-transcribed loci. Biochemical characterisation revealed that in addition to ssRNA and dsRNA, UAP56 interacts with dsDNA, but not with ssDNA. Moreover, the enzyme displays ATPase activity that is stimulated by RNA and dsDNA and it has ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity unwinding dsRNA, whereas it does not unwind dsDNA. Protein interaction studies showed that UAP56 directly interacts with the mRNA export factors ALY2 and MOS11, suggesting that it is involved in mRNA export from plant cell nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W1966412165,"Background We aimed to assess the changes in health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with confirmed diagnosis of influenza (H1N1)2009, and to estimate the individual and societal loss of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) caused by the pandemic. Methods and Results Longitudinal study of patients recruited at major hospitals and primary care centers in Spain. Patients reported their HRQL (EQ-5D) during their influenza episode and seven days prior to it. A subsample was monitored to evaluate HRQL after recovery. HRQL loss was estimated as the difference between EQ-5D prior to the influenza episode and during it. Individual QALY loss (disutility multiplied by the duration of the influenza episode in days) for confirmed cases was calculated and used to estimate the societal loss in Spain (with the official estimations). A total of 432 inpatients and 563 outpatients were included, of whom 145 and 184, respectively, were followed up. Baseline mean HRQL loss was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.53–0.63) for inpatients and 0.43 (95% CI, 0.40–0.46) for outpatients. The majority of the 145 inpatients and 184 outpatients who were followed up regained initial HRQL levels, presenting a mean difference of 0.01 between the EQ-5D score prior to and after the influenza episode. Individual QALY losses for inpatients (0.031, 95% CI, 0.025–0.037) were higher than for outpatients (0.009, 95% CI, 0.007–0.011), while societal QALY losses were reversed: 94 years for inpatients and 6,778 years for outpatients. For fatal cases (an official number of 318), we estimated a QALY loss of 11,981. Conclusions The influenza (H1N1)2009 pandemic had a significant but temporary impact on the HRQL of the majority of confirmed in- and outpatients. The societal impact of the influenza pandemic in Spain was estimated to be higher than other acute conditions. These results provide useful data for future cost-utility analyses."

Mucosal wounds in inflammatory disorders compromise the critical epithelial barrier. In response to injury, intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) rapidly migrate to reseal wounds. We have previously observed that a membrane-associated, actin binding protein, annexin A2 (AnxA2), is up-regulated in migrating IECs and plays an important role in promoting wound closure. To identify the mechanisms by which AnxA2 promotes IEC movement and wound closure, we used a loss of function approach. AnxA2-specific shRNA was utilized to generate IECs with stable down-regulation of AnxA2. Loss of AnxA2 inhibited IEC migration while promoting enhanced cell-matrix adhesion. These functional effects were associated with increased levels of β1 integrin protein, which is reported to play an important role in mediating the cell-matrix adhesive properties of epithelial cells. Because cell migration requires dynamic turnover of integrin-based adhesions, we tested whether AnxA2 modulates internalization of cell surface β1 integrin required for forward cell movement. Indeed, pulse-chase biotinylation experiments in IECs lacking AnxA2 demonstrated a significant increase in cell surface β1 integrin that was accompanied by decreased β1 integrin internalization and degradation.

Conclusion: Annexin A2 promotes wound closure by regulating internalization of β1 integrin in migrating epithelial cells. Significance: This study identifies a novel role of annexin A2 in regulating β1 integrin internalization required for intestinal epithelial cell migration. The intestinal epithelium functions as a selectively permeable barrier that allows for the absorption of nutrients and fluids while excluding bacteria and toxins from underlying tissue compartments. The epithelium is highly dynamic as it is actively turned over by proliferation of crypt epithelial cells, migration of cells along the crypt-luminal axis, and apoptosis at the luminal surface. Epithelial injury such as that observed in inflammatory diseases leads to fluid and electrolyte loss as well as exposure to luminal antigens that further exacerbate the inflammatory response. It is therefore critical that epithelial wounds efficiently reseal so as to reestablish the intestinal epithelial barrier and restore the physiologic state. The intestinal epithelium has a remarkable capacity to efficiently reseal wounds. An important mechanism of intestinal epithelial wound closure involves migration of the epithelial cell sheet that rapidly covers denuded surfaces (1Rutten M.J. Ito S.

Cell migration requires regulated cycles of polarized cell-matrix attachment at the leading edge of the cell with corresponding detachment at its trailing edge. These critical migratory events are mediated by dynamic turnover of integrin-mediated adhesions. Indeed, disassembly of integrin-based cell-matrix adhesions is important for mediating forward cell movement. Past studies have shown that integrin based adhesions form at the leading edge, mature, and then disassemble at the trailing edge. Focal adhesion disassembly requires endocytosis of integrins that are then recycled back to the plasma membrane at the leading edge of migrating cells or destroyed by lysosomal degradation (4Caswell P.T.

Lentiviruses were generated in HEK293T cells by polyethyleneimine transfection (Open Biosystems). Titered lentiviruses were then used to transduce SK-CO15 and Caco2 human colonic cancer epithelial cells. Clonal lines were grown as described previously except for the addition of 2 μg/ml puromycin (30Severson E.A. Lee W.Y. Capaldo C.T. Nusrat A. Parkos C.A.

Cycloheximide (MP Biomedical) was used at the concentration of 50 μg/ml for the given amount of time at 37 °C before harvesting cells. Bafilomycin A1 (Acros) was used at the concentration of 30 nm for two hours at 37 °C before fixation. For transient rescue experiments, a pShuttle eGFP plasmid containing a shRNA-resistant AnxA2 (Addgene) was electroporated into cells in solution L, program 15 (Lonza). For scratch wound rescue experiments a shRNA-resistant AnxA2-eGFP was subcloned from pShuttle into pLEX to generate a shRNA-resistant AnxA2-eGFP lentivirus. Cells were transduced with the lentivirus and sorted for eGFP expression by flow cytometry. Supplemental Table 1 contains the shRNA sequences and primers used for the creation of shRNA-resistant constructs. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation before boiling in a reducing SDS sample buffer. After SDS-PAGE, resulting gels were transferred to Immobilon-Fl PVDF membranes (Millipore) overnight. Immunoblots were incubated in casein for 1 h to inhibit nonspecific binding followed by primary and secondary antibody treatment and scanned (LI-COR Biosciences). The following primary antibodies were used: β1 integrin clone EP1041Y (Novus), AnxA2 clone ZO14 (Invitrogen), paxillin clone 165 (BD), pPaxillin Y118 (2541, Cell Signaling), actin (A2668, Sigma), cyclin D1 clone DCS-6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), E-cadherin clone HECD-1 (in-house). Caveolin-1 clone N-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and transferrin receptor clone C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. Secondary antibodies were from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formalin for 20 min and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 3 min. Fixed cells were then incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h before primary antibody incubation overnight. After secondary antibody incubation, cells were mounted in ProLong® gold antifade agent (Invitrogen) before confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510). The following primary antibodies were used: pPaxillin Y118 (Cell Signaling), β1 integrin clone Mab13 (BD Biosciences), AnxA2 clone 3E8-B6 (Sigma). Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen. Proliferation was monitored by a 1-h pulse with 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (Invitrogen). Cells were fixed and permeabilized as described above before counterstaining with To-Pro® 3-iodide (Invitrogen) to highlight nuclei. For Rab5a co-localization experiments, cells were transduced in suspension with Celllight® early endosomes RFP, Bacmam (version 2.0, Invitrogen) before culturing. Focal adhesions in individual cells were quantified using To-Pro® 3-iodide to highlight nuclei and NIH ImageJ software. Scratch wounds were generated using suction via a micropipette. Time-lapse imaging of wound closure was then performed. Images of the leading edge were captured every 2 min for 4 h at 37 °C with an Electron Multiplying Charge-Coupled Device camera (Photometrics). For the 24-h time point, the bottom of the culture plate was scored by a marker perpendicular to the wound, and images were taken at this intersection immediately after wounding and 24 h later. NIH ImageJ was used to quantify wound areas. Single cell suspensions were generated using a non-enzymatic cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen). Equal concentrations of cells (10000 cells in 0.1 ml) were resuspended in optimem with 0.1% BSA and then incubated with BCECF-AM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Antibodies against β1 integrin, clone Mab13 (Becton Dickinson Biosciences) or clone TS2/16 (eBioscience), were dialyzed in PBS overnight and used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. Cells were incubated with these antibodies for 2 h prior to the adhesion assay. Antibody-treated cells were then allowed to adhere to a matrix-coated/BSA-blocked 96-well plate for 30 min at 37 °C. Plates were coated overnight with 10 μg/ml of MatrigelTM (356234, BD Biosciences) or fibronectin (354008, BD Biosciences). RNA was isolated using Trizol® (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I (Qiagen) prior to cDNA synthesis using an oligo(dT) primer and Superscript® III (Invitrogen). SYBR® Green master mix Applied Biosystems was used to perform real time PCR on a Bio-Rad iQ5 cycler. Cycle threshold values (Ct) were used to calculate the fold change in mRNA according to the 2′−ΔΔCT method (31Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2(−ΔΔCT) Method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123424) Google Scholar). GAPDH was used as a reference gene. Supplemental Table 1 includes PCR primer sequences. Cells were harvested in HBSS+ supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) before nitrogen cavitation at 200 psi for 15 min (32Macdonald J.L. Pike L.J. A simplified method for the preparation of detergent-free lipid rafts.J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The postnuclear supernatant was placed in the bottom of a 5–35% continuous sucrose gradient. Gradients were then centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 19 h in a SW41 rotor (Beckman) to isolated light density lipid rafts (∼21% sucrose). Sucrose fractions were harvested and immunoblotted. Pulse-chase biotinylation experiments were performed as described previously (33Roberts M. Barry S. Woods A. van der Sluijs P. Norman J.

Internalization of cell surface proteins was induced by placing the cells at 37 °C for 2 h. Biotin was stripped from non-internalized proteins by treating cells twice with 20 mm 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate sodium (Genscript) for 5 min. Cells were then treated with 20 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma) for 15 min to quench any remaining 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate sodium. Biotinylated proteins from soluble lysates (200 μg) were purified using monomeric avidin agarose (Pierce), eluted in a reducing SDS sample buffer, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. We have previously reported that AnxA2 is up-regulated in migrating IECs and controls cell motility and wound closure (13Babbin B.A. Parkos C.A. Mandell K.J. Winfree L.M. Laur O. Ivanov A.I. Nusrat A. Annexin 2 regulates intestinal epithelial cell spreading and wound closure through Rho-related signaling.Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 951-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To further identify the mechanisms by which AnxA2 regulates epithelial cell motility, we generated cell lines with stable down-regulation of AnxA2 using two different shRNA sequences (shAnxA2) and a control cell line with a non-silencing shRNA target (shCtrl). Additionally, to verify our results, AnxA2 was stably down-regulated in two model IECs (SK-CO15, Caco2). Immunoblot analysis revealed a significant down-regulation of AnxA2 (>80% reduction) in shAnxA2 cells as compared with shCtrl cells (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, to determine whether any effects of the AnxA2 shRNA were specific to loss of AnxA2 protein, we transduced shAnxA2 cells with a shRNA-resistant eGFP-tagged AnxA2. As shown in Fig. 1A, the AnxA2 eGFP fusion protein was identified at 70 kDa using an AnxA2 antibody. Actin and tubulin were used as loading controls. We next tested the functional effects of stable AnxA2 down-regulation and rescue on IEC wound closure. Using an in vitro scratch wound resealing assay and time-lapse imaging, we observed that loss of AnxA2 resulted in a 4-fold delay in wound closure over a four hour time period and re-expression of AnxA2 was able to significantly rescue the delay in wound closure (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1B, supplemental Movies 1–3). Similarly, after 24 h of wound closure, shAnxA2 cells displayed a 2-fold decrease in wound closure that was abrogated in shAnxA2 cells re-expressing AnxA2 (supplemental Fig. 1A). These experiments support a role of AnxA2 in controlling intestinal epithelial wound closure. Because wound closure can be mediated by cell proliferation in addition to cell migration, epithelial proliferation was evaluated by determining EdU incorporation in cells during wound closure. Despite decreased wound closure in shAnxA2 cells as compared with control cells, we observed increased proliferation in cells with down-regulated AnxA2 (supplemental Fig. 1B). These findings suggest that the decreased wound closure following AnxA2 down-regulation is mediated by an influence of this protein on epithelial cell migration. Because AnxA2 facilitates IEC migration that, in turn, requires dynamic turnover of cell-matrix associations, we next investigated the adhesion of epithelial cells to a complex extracellular matrix. Down-regulation of AnxA2 increased cell-matrix adhesion (40% increase) (Fig. 2A, left panel). In an analogous manner, increased adhesion of shAnxA2 cells to fibronectin was also observed (Fig. 2A, right panel). Because SK-CO15 cells were used for these assays, we verified adhesive properties of another model intestinal epithelial cell line, Caco2. Analogous to SK-CO15 cells, increased cell-matrix adhesion was seen in Caco2 cells with down-regulated AnxA2 (data not shown). To biochemically link functional cell-matrix adhesion to the activity of proteins that mediate cell-matrix adherence, we evaluated the phosphorylation/activation status of the β1 integrin scaffold protein, paxillin. Phosphorylated paxillin at tyrosine 118 (pPaxY118) has been previously reported in engaged cell-matrix adhesions (35Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and pp125FAK accompanies cell adhesion to extracellular matrix: a role in cytoskeletal assembly.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 36Bellis S.L. Perrotta J.A. Curtis M.S. Turner C.E. Adhesion of fibroblasts to fibronectin stimulates both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin.Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In keeping with the increased adhesive properties of shAnxA2 cells, immunoblot analysis revealed pPaxY118 and total Paxillin levels were increased 2-fold in shAnxA2 cells compared with shCtrl IECs (Fig. 2B). Immunofluorescence labeling and confocal microscopy of spreading cells corroborated the biochemical results. In shCtrl cells, pPaxY118 is visualized in short punctate basal structures representing focal adhesions. In shAnxA2 cells, the pPaxY118 containing cell-matrix adhesions were more prominent in size and staining intensity. Quantification of pPaxY118-positive adhesions per spreading cell revealed a 2-fold increase in the number adhesions in cells with down-regulated AnxA2 (Fig. 2D). These findings support a role of AnxA2 in regulating cell-matrix adhesions in IECs migrating to close wounds. Cell surface β1 integrin mediates IEC-matrix adhesion and plays an important role in cell movement. Because we had observed that AnxA2 down-regulation resulted in increased cell-matrix adhesion with a concomitant increase in pPaxY118 containing focal adhesions, we next determined whether the increase in cell-matrix adhesion in shAnxA2 cells was dependent upon β1 integrin function. Inhibitory (Mab13) but not non-inhibitory (TS2/16) β1 integrin antibodies abrogated the increase in cell-matrix adhesion in shCtrl and shAnxA2 cells (Fig. 2A, right panel). Additionally, the inhibition of β1 integrin abrogated the difference in pPaxY118 in shCtrl and shAnxA2 cells (Fig. 2C). To better understand how AnxA2 regulates β1 integrin, we first examined the steady state levels of β1 integrin mRNA and protein. IEC immunoblots revealed a 2-fold increase in β1 integrin protein in shAnxA2 cells as compared with shCtrl cells (Fig. 3A). The increased β1 integrin protein in shAnxA2 cells was not associated with a corresponding increase in β1 integrin mRNA (Fig. 3B), suggesting an influence of AnxA2 on β1 integrin protein dynamics/stability. We next determined whether AnxA2 regulates the post-translational stability of β1 integrin. As shown in Fig. 3C, the stability of β1 integrin protein was increased 4 h after cycloheximide treatment in shAnxA2 cells as compared with shCtrl cells. Additionally, β1 integrin stability was significantly increased after 8 h of cycloheximide treatment in shAnxA2 cells as compared with shCtrl cells (p < 0.05). Given that down-regulation of AnxA2 resulted in increased stability of β1 integrin protein, we next determined β1 integrin subcellular localization by immunofluorescence labeling and confocal microscopy. In control cells, β1 integrin is visualized in intracellular punctate, “vesicle-like” structures that were prominent at the leading edge of migrating cells in addition to a small pool in the basolateral membrane. However, in migrating shAnxA2 cells, β1 integrin was localized predominantly in the basolateral membrane of migrating cells (Fig. 3D). These findings suggest that loss of AnxA2 results in increased β1 integrin at the cell surface. To further support these results, we biochemically analyzed cell surface β1 integrin levels. Cell surface biotinylation, avidin pulldown, and β1 integrin immunoblotting revealed a 6-fold increase in cell surface β1 integrin relative to total β1 integrin in shAnxA2 cells as compared with control cells (Fig. 3E). The AnxA2 effects observed were specific for β1 integrin as we did not observe a change in total and cell surface levels of another basolateral plasma membrane-associated protein, E-cadherin. The influence of AnxA2 loss on total and cell surface β1 integrin levels was also confirmed in another model intestinal epithelial cell line, Caco2 (Fig. 3F). Cell surface proteins undergo trafficking into early endosomes. Thus, to further characterize β1 integrin trafficking in cells with down-regulated AnxA2, we co-localized β1 integrin with Rab5a, a marker of early endosomes. To highlight early endosomes, a CellLight® early endosome RFP, Bacmam (version 2.0, RFP-Rab5a) construct was expressed in migrating IECs. In shCtrl cells, a large pool of β1 integrin co-localized with early endosomes. However, in shAnxA2 cells, β1 integrin was distribut"
https://openalex.org/W1994656768,"Streptomycetes are very important industrial bacteria, which produce two thirds of all clinically relevant secondary metabolites. They have a complex developmental-cycle in which an early compartmentalized mycelium (MI) differentiates to a multinucleated mycelium (MII) that grows inside the culture medium (substrate mycelium) until it starts to growth into the air (aerial mycelium) and ends up forming spores. Streptomyces developmental studies have focused mainly on the later stages of MII differentiation (aerial mycelium and sporulation), with regulation of pre-sporulation stages (MI/MII transition) essentially unknown. This work represents the first study of the Streptomyces MI transcriptome, analyzing how it differs from the MII transcriptome. We have used a very conservative experimental approach to fractionate MI from MII and quantify gene expressions. The expression of well characterized key developmental/metabolic genes involved in bioactive compound production (actinorhodin, undecylprodigiosin, calcium-dependent antibiotic, cpk, geosmin) or hydrophobic cover formation-sporulation (bld, whi, wbl, rdl, chp, ram) was correlated with MII differentiation. Additionally, 122 genes conserved in the Streptomyces genus, whose biological function had not been previously characterized, were found to be differentially expressed (more than 4-fold) in MI or MII. These genes encoded for putative regulatory proteins (transcriptional regulators, kinases), as well as hypothetical proteins. Knowledge about differences between the MI (vegetative) and MII (reproductive) transcriptomes represents a huge advance in Streptomyces biology that will make future experiments possible aimed at characterizing the biochemical pathways controlling pre-sporulation developmental stages and activation of secondary metabolism in Streptomyces."
https://openalex.org/W2167147553,"The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is one of the central effectors involved in regulation of salt and water homeostasis in the kidney. To study mechanisms of ENaC regulation, we generated knockout mice lacking the insulin receptor (InsR KO) specifically in the collecting duct principal cells. Single-channel analysis in freshly isolated split-open tubules demonstrated that the InsR-KO mice have significantly lower ENaC activity compared to their wild-type (C57BL/6J) littermates when animals were fed either normal or sodium-deficient diets. Immunohistochemical and Western blot assays demonstrated no significant changes in expression of ENaC subunits in InsR-KO mice compared to wild-type littermates. Insulin treatment caused greater ENaC activity in split-open tubules isolated from wild-type mice but did not have this effect in the InsR-KO mice. Thus, these results suggest that insulin increases ENaC activity via its own receptor affecting the channel open probability. To further determine the mechanism of the action of insulin on ENaC, we used mouse mpkCCDc14 principal cells. Insulin significantly augmented amiloride-sensitive transepithelial flux in these cells. Pretreatment of the mpkCCDc14 cells with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002; 10 μM) or mTOR (PP242; 100 nM) inhibitors precluded this effect. This study provides new information about the importance of insulin receptors expressed in collecting duct principal cells for ENaC activity.—Pavlov, T. S., Ilatovskaya, D.

https://openalex.org/W2084977582,"Development of resistance to first line antimalarials led to recommendation of artemisinin based combination therapies (ACTs). High adherence to ACTs provided by community health workers (CHWs) gave reassurance that community based interventions did not increase the risk of drug resistance. Integrated community case management of illnesses (ICCM) is now recommended through which children will access both antibiotics and antimalarials from CHWs. Increased number of medicines has been shown to lower adherence.To compare adherence to antimalarials alone versus antimalarials combined with antibiotics under ICCM in children less than five years.A cohort study was nested within a cluster randomized trial that had CHWs treating children less than five years with antimalarials and antibiotics (intervention areas) and CHWs treating children with antimalarials only (control areas). Children were consecutively sampled from the CHWs' registers in the control areas (667 children); and intervention areas (323 taking antimalarials only and 266 taking antimalarials plus antibiotics). The sampled children were visited at home on day one and four of treatment seeking. Adherence was assessed using self reports and pill counts.Adherence in the intervention arm to antimalarials alone and antimalarials plus antibiotics arm was similar (mean 99% in both groups) but higher than adherence in the control arm (antimalarials only) (mean 96%). Forgetfulness (38%) was the most cited reason for non-adherence. At adjusted analysis: absence of fever (OR = 3.3, 95%CI =1.6-6.9), seeking care after two or more days (OR = 2.2, 95%CI = 1.3-3.7), not understanding instructions given (OR = 24.5, 95%CI = 2.7-224.5), vomiting (OR = 2.6, 95%CI = 1.2-5.5), and caregivers' perception that the child's illness was not severe (OR = 2.0, 95%CI = 1.1-3.8) were associated with non-adherence.Addition of antibiotics to antimalarials did not lower adherence. However, caregivers should be adequately counseled to understand the dosing regimens; continue with medicines even when the child seems to improve; and re-administer doses that have been vomited."
https://openalex.org/W2032496521,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) preferentially migrate to damaged tissues and, due to their immunomodulatory and trophic properties, contribute to tissue repair. Although MSC express molecules, such as membrane cofactor protein (CD46), complement decay-accelerating factor (CD55), and protectin (CD59), which confer protection from complement-mediated lysis, MSC are recruited and activated by anaphylatoxins after transplantation, potentially causing MSC death and limiting therapeutic benefit. We have previously demonstrated that transduction of MSC with a retrovirus encoding HCMV-US proteins resulted in higher levels of MSC engraftment due to decreased HLA-I expression. Here, we investigate whether engineering MSC to express US2 (MSC-US2), US3 (MSC-US3), US6 (MSC-US6), or US11 (MSC-US11) HCMV proteins can alter complement recognition, thereby better protecting MSC from complement attack and lysis. HCMV-US proteins increased MSC CD59 expression at different levels as determined by flow cytometric evaluation of the median fluorescence intensity ratio (MFI). A significant increase in CD59 expression was seen in MSC-US2, MSC-US3, and MSC-US6, but not in MSC-US11. Only MSC-US2 displayed increased expression of CD46, while US2 and US3 proteins were both able to augment the percentage of MSC expressing this molecule. Regardless of the HCMV protein expressed, none changed CD55 MFI; however, expression of US6, US11, and US2 each increased the percentage of MSC that were positive for this molecule. Because US2 protein was the most efficient in up-regulating all three complement regulatory proteins, we used a functional complement-mediated cytotoxicity assay to investigate whether MSC-US2 were protected from complement-mediated lysis. We demonstrated that over-expression of the US2 protein reduced complement lysis by 59.10±12.89% when compared to untransduced MSC. This is the first report, to our knowledge, describing a role of HCMV-US proteins in complement evasion, and our data shows that over-expression of US2 protein on MSC could serve as a strategy to protect these cells from complement lysis."
https://openalex.org/W2095020383,"Inflammation inhibits normal lung morphogenesis in preterm infants. Soluble inflammatory mediators present in the lungs of patients developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia disrupt expression of multiple genes critical for development. However, the mechanisms linking innate immune signaling and developmental programs are not clear. NF-κB activation inhibits expression of the critical morphogen FGF-10. Here, we show that interactions between the RELA subunit of NF-κB and SP3 suppress SP1-mediated FGF-10 expression. SP3 co-expression reduced SP1-mediated Fgf-10 promoter activity, suggesting antagonistic interactions between SP1 and SP3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of LPS-treated primary mouse fetal lung mesenchymal cells detected increased interactions between SP3, RELA, and the Fgf-10 promoter. Expression of a constitutively active IκB kinase β mutant not only decreased Fgf-10 promoter activity but also increased RELA-SP3 nuclear interactions. Expression of a dominant-negative IκB, which blocks NF-κB nuclear translocation, prevented inhibition of FGF-10 by SP3. The inhibitory functions of SP3 required sequences located in the N-terminal region of the protein. These data suggested that inhibition of FGF-10 by inflammatory signaling involves the NF-κB-dependent interactions between RELA, SP3, and the Fgf-10 promoter. NF-κB activation may therefore lead to reduced gene expression by recruiting inhibitory factors to specific gene promoters following exposure to inflammatory stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2122382762,"Although complement is a known contributor to biomaterial-induced complications, pathological implications and therapeutic options remain to be explored. Here we investigated the involvement of complement in the inflammatory response to polypropylene meshes commonly used for hernia repair. In vitro assays revealed deposition of complement activation fragments on the mesh after incubation in plasma. Moreover, significant mesh-induced complement and granulocyte activation was observed in plasma and leukocyte preparations, respectively. Pretreatment of plasma with the complement inhibitor compstatin reduced opsonization >2-fold, and compstatin and a C5a receptor antagonist (C5aRa) impaired granulocyte activation by 50 and 67%, respectively. We established a clinically relevant mouse model of implantation and could confirm deposition of C3 activation fragments on mesh implants in vivo using immunofluorescence. In meshes extracted after subcutaneous or peritoneal implantation, the amount of immune cell infiltrate in mice deficient in key complement components (C3, C5aR), or treated with C5aRa, was approximately half of that observed in wild-type littermates or mice treated with inactive C5aRa, respectively. Our data suggest that implantation of a widely used surgical mesh triggers the formation of an inflammatory cell microenvironment at the implant site through complement activation, and indicates a path for the therapeutic modulation of implant-related complications."
https://openalex.org/W2014926534,"Zymogenicity is a regulatory mechanism that prevents inadequate catalytic activity in the wrong context. It plays a central role in maintaining microbial virulence factors in an inactive form inside the pathogen until secretion. Among these virulence factors is the cysteine peptidase gingipain B (RgpB), which is the major virulence factor secreted by the periodontopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis that attacks host vasculature and defense proteins. The structure of the complex between soluble mature RgpB, consisting of a catalytic domain and an immunoglobulin superfamily domain, and its 205-residue N-terminal prodomain, the largest structurally characterized to date for a cysteine peptidase, reveals a novel fold for the prodomain that is distantly related to sugar-binding lectins. It attaches laterally to the catalytic domain through a large concave surface. The main determinant for latency is a surface ""inhibitory loop,"" which approaches the active-site cleft of the enzyme on its non-primed side in a substrate-like manner. It inserts an arginine (Arg(126)) into the S1 pocket, thus matching the substrate specificity of the enzyme. Downstream of Arg(126), the polypeptide leaves the cleft, thereby preventing cleavage. Moreover, the carbonyl group of Arg(126) establishes a very strong hydrogen bond with the co-catalytic histidine, His(440), pulling it away from the catalytic cysteine, Cys(473), and toward Glu(381), which probably plays a role in orienting the side chain of His(440) during catalysis. The present results provide the structural determinants of zymogenic inhibition of RgpB by way of a novel inhibitory mechanism for peptidases in general and open the field for the design of novel inhibitory strategies in the treatment of human periodontal disease."
https://openalex.org/W1992226176,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a specific disease process distinct from coronary artery disease and hypertension. The disease features cardiac remodeling stimulated by hyperglycemia of the left ventricle wall and disrupts contractile functions. Cardiac mast cells may be activated by metabolic byproducts resulted from hyperglycermia and then participate in the remodeling process by releasing a multitude of cytokines and bioactive enzymes. Nedocromil, a pharmacologic stabilizer of mast cells, has been shown to normalize cytokine levels and attenuate cardiac remodeling. In this study, we describe the activation of cardiac mast cells by inducing diabetes in normal mice using streptozotocin (STZ). Next, we treated the diabetic mice with nedocromil for 12 weeks and then examined their hearts for signs of cardiac remodeling and quantified contractile function. We observed significantly impaired heart function in diabetic mice, as well as increased cardiac mast cell density and elevated mast cell secretions that correlated with gene expression and aberrant cytokine levels associated with cardiac remodeling. Nedocromil treatment halted contractile dysfunction in diabetic mice and reduced cardiac mast cell density, which correlated with reduced bioactive enzyme secretions, reduced expression of extracellular matrix remodeling factors and collagen synthesis, and normalized cytokine levels. However, the results showed nedocromil treatments did not return diabetic mice to a normal state. We concluded that manipulation of cardiac mast cell function is sufficient to attenuate cardiomyopathy stimulated by diabetes, but other cellular pathways also contribute to the disease process."

Although progress is being made, protein analysis from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues is still challenging. In previous reports, we showed that the novel formalin-free tissue preservation technology, the PAXgene Tissue System, allows the extraction of intact and immunoreactive proteins from PAXgene-fixed and paraffin-embedded (PFPE) tissues. In the current study, we focused on the analysis of phosphoproteins and the applicability of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to the analysis of a variety of malignant and non-malignant human tissues. Using western blot analysis, we found that phosphoproteins are quantitatively preserved in PFPE tissues, and signal intensities are comparable to that in paired, frozen tissues. Furthermore, proteins extracted from PFPE samples are suitable for 2D-PAGE and can be quantified by ELISA specific for denatured proteins. In summary, the PAXgene Tissue System reliably preserves phosphoproteins in human tissue samples, even after prolonged fixation or stabilization times, and is compatible with methods for protein analysis such as 2D-PAGE and ELISA. We conclude that the PAXgene Tissue System has the potential to serve as a versatile tissue fixative for modern pathology."

We therefore studied the role of NFκB In a cohort of clinical DLBCL samples and ABC cell lines. In our clinical tissue microarray cohort of DLBCL samples, p-IκBα was detected in 38.3% of ABC DLBCL and was an independent prognostic marker for poor survival. In vitro, we found that Thymoquinone (TQ), a natural compound isolated from Nigella sativa caused release of ROS in ABC cells. TQ-mediated release of ROS in turn inhibited NFκB activity by dephosphorylating IκBα and decreased translocation of p65 subunit of NFκB in the nuclear compartment in ABC cell lines. This led to inhibition of cell viability and induction of mitochondrial dependent apoptosis in ABC-DLBCL cell lines. Additionally, TQ treatment also caused up-regulation of death receptor 5 (DR5), however, up-regulation of DR5 did not play a role in TQ-induced apoptosis. Finally, combination of sub-optimal doses of TQ and TRAIL induced efficient apoptosis in ABC-DLBCL cell lines. These data show that p-IκBα can be used as a prognostic marker and target for therapy in this aggressive sub-type of DLBCL and TQ may play an important role in the management of DLBCL in the future."

In the present study, general practitioners (n = 42) from the Dutch Sentinel General Practice Network collected urinary samples from 560 male patients (≥18 years) suspected of UTI and recorded prescribed antibiotic treatment. In this way, the antibiotic susceptibility of Gram-negative uropathogens, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL-) producing Escherichia coli could be determined. In addition, E. coli susceptibility and antibiotic prescriptions were compared with data from a similar UTI study among women and with data collected 7 years earlier. Of 367 uropathogens (66%) identified (≥103 cfu/mL), most were Gram-negative (83%) and E. coli being isolated most frequently (51%). Antibiotic susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and nitrofurantoin was 94%, 92% and 88%, respectively, whereas co-amoxiclav (76%) and co-trimoxazole (80%) showed lower susceptibilities. One ESBL (0.5%) was found. A significantly higher proportion of female UTIs was caused by E. coli compared with men (72% versus 51%, P<0.05). E. coli susceptibility tended to be lower in men compared with women, although not reaching statistical significance. No changes in E. coli susceptibility were observed over time (all P>0.05). Co-amoxiclav and nitrofurantoin prescriptions increased over time (11% versus 28% and 16% versus 23% respectively, both P<0.05), whereas co-trimoxazole prescriptions decreased (24% versus 14%, P<0.05). In conclusion, given the observed gender differences in uropathogen distribution and (tendency in) E. coli antibiotic susceptibility, empirical male UTI treatment options should be based on surveillance studies including men only. When awaiting the culture result is clinically not possible, fluoroquinolones are advised as first-choice antibiotics for male UTIs in Dutch general practices based on current antibiotic susceptibility data. The prevalence of ESBL-producers was low and no differences were observed in antibiotic susceptibility over a 7-year period. In addition, antibiotic prescriptions changed in accordance with national guidelines during this time period."
https://openalex.org/W2076335641,"Various natural polysaccharides are capable of activating the immune system and therefore can be employed as biological response modifiers in anti-tumor therapy. We previously found a homogenous polysaccharide from the mycelium of marine fungus Phoma herbarum YS4108, named YCP, exhibiting strong in vivo antitumor ability via enhancement of the host immune responses. To further elucidate the role of YCP as a biological response modifier, the immunomoduating activities of YCP in B cells was investigated in the current study. We demonstrated that stimulation of YCP with murine splenic B cells resulted in cell proliferation and generation of IgM antibody response. Binding of YCP to B cells was a direct, saturable and reversible event and required TLR2 and TLR4 involvement. TLR2 and TLR4 defunctionalization by either antibody blocking or allele-specific mutation significantly impaired the B-cell proliferative and IgM responses to YCP. YCP interaction with TLR2 and TLR4 led to the activation of intracellular p38, ERK and JNK, as well as the translocation of transcriptional factor NF-κB into nucleus. Furthermore, specific inhibitors of p38, ERK, JNK and NF-κB could attenuate the ability of YCP to induce B cell proliferation and IgM production. Taken together, this study has indicated for the first time the immunostimulating properties of YCP on B cells through a receptor-mediated mechanism, which involves TLR2 and TLR4 and resultant activation of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby highlighting the role of YCP as an efficacious biological response modifier in oncologic immunotherapy."

The current study examined the expression and the prognostic value of PPM1D mRNA in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods Total RNA was extracted from 86 HCC and paired non-cancerous liver tissues. PPM1D mRNA expression was determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Immunohistochemistry assay was used to verify the expression of ppm1d protein in the HCC and non-cancerous liver tissues. HCC patients were grouped according to PPM1D mRNA expression with the average PPM1D mRNA level in non-cancerous liver tissue samples as the cut-off. Correlations between clinicopathologic variables, overall survival and PPM1D mRNA expression were analyzed. Findings PPM1D mRNA was significantly higher in HCC than in the paired non-cancerous tissue (p<0.01). This was confirmed by ppm1d staining. 56 patients were classified as high expression group and the other 30 patients were categorized as low expression group. There were significant differences between the two groups in term of alpha-fetoprotein (α-FP) level (p<0.01), tumor size (p<0.01), TNM stage (p<0.01), recurrence incidence (p<0.01) and family history of liver cancer (p<0.01). The current study failed to find significant differences between the two groups in the following clinical characteristics: age, gender, portal vein invasion, lymphnode metastasis, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and alcohol intake. Survival time of high expression group was significantly shorter than that of low expression group (median survival, 13 months and 32 months, respectively, p<0.01). Conclusion Up-regulation of PPM1D mRNA was associated with progressive pathological feature and poor prognosis in HCC patients. PPM1D mRNA may serve as a prognostic marker in HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2052874074,"Shewanella oneidensis is a facultative anaerobic γ-proteobacterium possessing remarkably diverse respiratory capacities for reducing various organic and inorganic substrates. As a veteran research model for investigating redox transformations of environmental contaminants the bacterium is well known to be a naturally ampicillin-resistant microorganism. However, in this study we discovered that ampicillin has a significant impact on growth of S. oneidensis. Particularly, cell lysis occurred only with ampicillin at levels ranging from 0.49 to 6.25 µg/ml but not at 50 µg/ml. This phenotype is attributable to insufficient expression of the β-lactamase BlaA. The subsequent analysis revealed that the blaA gene is strongly induced by ampicillin at high (50 µg/ml), but not at low levels (2.5 µg/ml). In addition, we demonstrated that penicillin binding protein 5 (PBP5), the most abundant low molecular weight PBP (LMW PBP), is the only one relevant to β-lactam resistance under the tested conditions. This nonessential PBP, largely resembling its Escherichia coli counterpart in functionality, mediates expression of the blaA gene."

https://openalex.org/W1963942263,"Podosomes are cellular “feet,” characterized by F-actin-rich membrane protrusions, which drive cell migration and invasion into the extracellular matrix. Small GTPases that regulate the actin cytoskeleton, such as Cdc42 and Rac are central regulators of podosome formation. The adaptor protein IRSp53 contains an I-BAR domain that deforms membranes into protrusions and binds to Rac, a CRIB motif that interacts with Cdc42, an SH3 domain that binds to many actin cytoskeletal regulators with proline-rich peptides including VASP, and the C-terminal variable region by splicing. However, the role of IRSp53 and VASP in podosome formation had been unclear. Here we found that the knockdown of IRSp53 by RNAi attenuates podosome formation and migration in Src-transformed NIH3T3 (NIH-Src) cells. Importantly, the differences in the IRSp53 C-terminal splicing isoforms did not affect podosome formation. Overexpression of IRSp53 deletion mutants suggested the importance of linking small GTPases to SH3 binding partners. Interestingly, VASP physically interacted with IRSp53 in NIH-Src cells and was essential for podosome formation. These data highlight the role of IRSp53 as a linker of small GTPases to VASP for podosome formation."
https://openalex.org/W2030348083,"Background Diesel exhaust particle (DEP) exposure enhances allergic inflammation and has been linked to the incidence of asthma. Oxidative stress on the thiol molecules cysteine (Cys) and glutathione (GSH) can promote inflammatory host responses. The effect of DEP on the thiol oxidation/reduction (redox) state in the asthmatic lung is unknown. Objective To determine if DEP exposure alters the Cys or GSH redox state in the asthmatic airway. Methods Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was obtained from a house dust mite (HDM) induced murine asthma model exposed to DEP. GSH, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), Cys, cystine (CySS), and s-glutathionylated cysteine (CySSG) were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. Results DEP co-administered with HDM, but not DEP or HDM alone, decreased total Cys, increased CySS, and increased CySSG without significantly altering GSH or GSSG. Conclusions DEP exposure promotes oxidation and S-glutathionylation of cysteine amino acids in the asthmatic airway, suggesting a novel mechanism by which DEP may enhance allergic inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W1992859751,"Vertebrate APC collaborates with Dia through its Basic domain to assemble actin filaments.Despite limited sequence homology between the vertebrate and Drosophila APC Basic domains, Drosophila APC1 collaborates with Dia to stimulate actin assembly in vitro.The mechanism of actin assembly is highly conserved over evolution.APC-Dia collaborations may be crucial in a wide range of animal cells. Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a large multidomain protein that regulates the cytoskeleton. Recently, it was shown that vertebrate APC through its Basic domain directly collaborates with the formin mDia1 to stimulate actin filament assembly in the presence of nucleation barriers. However, it has been unclear whether these activities extend to homologues of APC and Dia in other organisms. Drosophila APC and Dia are each required to promote actin furrow formation in the syncytial embryo, suggesting a potential collaboration in actin assembly, but low sequence homology between the Basic domains of Drosophila and vertebrate APC has left their functional and mechanistic parallels uncertain. To address this question, we purified Drosophila APC1 and Dia and determined their individual and combined effects on actin assembly using both bulk fluorescence assays and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Our data show that APC1, similar to its vertebrate homologue, bound to actin monomers and nucleated and bundled filaments. Further, Drosophila Dia nucleated actin assembly and protected growing filament barbed ends from capping protein. Drosophila APC1 and Dia directly interacted and collaborated to promote actin assembly in the combined presence of profilin and capping protein. Thus, despite limited sequence homology, Drosophila and vertebrate APCs exhibit highly related activities and mechanisms and directly collaborate with formins. These results suggest that APC-Dia interactions in actin assembly are conserved and may underlie important in vivo functions in a broad range of animal phyla."
https://openalex.org/W2065020496,"During the last decade, an increasing number of papers have described the use of various genera of bacteria, including E. coli and S. typhimurium, in the treatment of cancer. This is primarily due to the facts that not only are these bacteria capable of accumulating in the tumor mass, but they can also be engineered to deliver specific therapeutic proteins directly to the tumor site. However, a major obstacle exists in that bacteria because the plasmid carrying the therapeutic gene is not needed for bacterial survival, these plasmids are often lost from the bacteria. Here, we report the development of a balanced-lethal host-vector system based on deletion of the glmS gene in E. coli and S. typhimurium. This system takes advantage of the phenotype of the GlmS(-) mutant, which undergoes lysis in animal systems that lack the nutrients required for proliferation of the mutant bacteria, D-glucosamine (GlcN) or N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), components necessary for peptidoglycan synthesis. We demonstrate that plasmids carrying a glmS gene (GlmS(+)p) complemented the phenotype of the GlmS(-) mutant, and that GlmS(+) p was maintained faithfully both in vitro and in an animal system in the absence of selection pressure. This was further verified by bioluminescent signals from GlmS (+)pLux carried in bacteria that accumulated in grafted tumor tissue in a mouse model. The signal was up to several hundred-fold stronger than that from the control plasmid, pLux, due to faithful maintenance of the plasmid. We believe this system will allow to package a therapeutic gene onto an expression plasmid for bacterial delivery to the tumor site without subsequent loss of plasmid expression as well as to quantify bioluminescent bacteria using in vivo imaging by providing a direct correlation between photon flux and bacterial number."

https://openalex.org/W1969369802,"The intrahelical salt bridge between E/D(3.49) and R(3.50) within the E/DRY motif on helix 3 (H3) and the interhelical hydrogen bonding between the E/DRY and residues on H6 are thought to be critical in stabilizing the class A G protein-coupled receptors in their inactive state. Removal of these interactions is expected to generate constitutively active receptors. This study examines how neutralization of E(3.49/6.30) in the thromboxane prostanoid (TP) receptor alters ligand binding, basal, and agonist-induced activity and investigates the molecular mechanisms of G protein activation. We demonstrate here that a panel of full and partial agonists showed an increase in affinity and potency for E129V and E240V mutants. Yet, even augmenting the sensitivity to detect constitutive activity (CA) with overexpression of the receptor or the G protein revealed resistance to an increase in basal activity, while retaining fully the ability to cause agonist-induced signaling. However, direct G protein activation measured through bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) indicates that these mutants more efficiently communicate and/or activate their cognate G proteins. These results suggest the existence of additional constrains governing the shift of TP receptor to its active state, together with an increase propensity of these mutants to agonist-induced signaling, corroborating their definition as superactive mutants. The particular nature of the TP receptor as somehow ""resistant"" to CA should be examined in the context of its pathophysiological role in the cardiovascular system. Evolutionary forces may have favored regulation mechanisms leading to low basal activity and selected against more highly active phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2042906014,"A fundamental problem in vision science is how useful perceptions and behaviors arise in the absence of information about the physical sources of retinal stimuli (the inverse optics problem). Psychophysical studies show that human observers contend with this problem by using the frequency of occurrence of stimulus patterns in cumulative experience to generate percepts. To begin to understand the neural mechanisms underlying this strategy, we examined the connectivity of simple neural networks evolved to respond according to the cumulative rank of stimulus luminance values. Evolved similarities with the connectivity of early level visual neurons suggests that biological visual circuitry uses the same mechanisms as a means of creating useful perceptions and behaviors without information about the real world."
https://openalex.org/W2143439413,"Circulating lipids levels, as well as several familial lipid metabolism disorders, are strongly associated with initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and incidence of myocardial infarction (MI).We hypothesized that genetic variants associated with circulating lipid levels would also be associated with MI incidence, and have tested this in three independent samples.Using age- and sex-adjusted additive genetic models, we analyzed 554 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 41 candidate gene regions proposed to be involved in lipid-related pathways potentially predisposing to incidence of MI in 2,602 participants of the Swedish Twin Register (STR; 57% women). All associations with nominal P<0.01 were further investigated in the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM; N = 1,142).In the present study, we report associations of lipid-related SNPs with incident MI in two community-based longitudinal studies with in silico replication in a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies. Overall, there were 9 SNPs in STR with nominal P-value <0.01 that were successfully genotyped in ULSAM. rs4149313 located in ABCA1 was associated with MI incidence in both longitudinal study samples with nominal significance (hazard ratio, 1.36 and 1.40; P-value, 0.004 and 0.015 in STR and ULSAM, respectively). In silico replication supported the association of rs4149313 with coronary artery disease in an independent meta-analysis including 173,975 individuals of European descent from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium (odds ratio, 1.03; P-value, 0.048).rs4149313 is one of the few amino acid changing variants in ABCA1 known to associate with reduced cholesterol efflux. Our results are suggestive of a weak association between this variant and the development of atherosclerosis and MI."
https://openalex.org/W2050859264,"Interactions between proteins are a hallmark of all cellular activities. Such interactions often occur with low affinity, a feature that allows them to be rapidly reversible, but it makes them difficult to detect using conventional methods such as yeast 2-hybrid analyses, co-immunoprecipitation or analytical ultracentrifugation. We developed a simple and economical bead aggregation assay to study low-affinity interactions between proteins. By coating beads with interacting proteins, the weak interactions between many proteins are sufficient to allow stable aggregation of beads, an avidity effect. The aggregation is easily measured to allow quantification of protein-protein interactions under a variety of controlled conditions. We use this assay to demonstrate low-affinity interactions between the N-terminal domains of an intracellular Ca2+ channel, the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. This simple bead aggregation assay may have widespread application in the study of low-affinity interactions between macromolecules."
https://openalex.org/W1966750791,"Abl interactor 1 (Abi1) is a scaffold protein that plays a central role in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics as a constituent of several key protein complexes, and homozygous loss of this protein leads to embryonic lethality in mice. Because this scaffold protein has been shown in cultured cells to be a critical component of pathways controlling cell migration and actin regulation at cell-cell contacts, we were interested to investigate the in vivo role of Abi1 in morphogenesis during the development of Xenopus embryos. Using morpholino-mediated translation inhibition, we demonstrate that knockdown of Abi1 in the whole embryo, or specifically in eye field progenitor cells, leads to disruption of eye morphogenesis. Moreover, signaling through the Src homology 3 domain of Abi1 is critical for proper movement of retinal progenitor cells into the eye field and their appropriate differentiation, and this process is dependent upon an interaction with the nucleation-promoting factor Wasp (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein). Collectively, our data demonstrate that the Abi1 scaffold protein is an essential regulator of cell movement processes required for normal eye development in Xenopus embryos and specifically requires an Src homology 3 domain-dependent interaction with Wasp to regulate this complex morphogenetic process."
https://openalex.org/W2074971097,"Rhodococcus equi is a facultative intracellular pathogen of macrophages and the causative agent of foal pneumonia. R. equi virulence is usually assessed by analyzing intracellular growth in macrophages by enumeration of bacteria following cell lysis, which is time consuming and does not allow for a high throughput analysis. This paper describes the use of an impedance based real-time method to characterize proliferation of R. equi in macrophages, using virulent and attenuated strains lacking the vapA gene or virulence plasmid. Image analysis suggested that the time-dependent cell response profile (TCRP) is governed by cell size and roundness as well as cytoxicity of infecting R. equi strains. The amplitude and inflection point of the resulting TCRP were dependent on the multiplicity of infection as well as virulence of the infecting strain, thus distinguishing between virulent and attenuated strains."
