https://openalex.org/W2137037787,"Superhydrophobic surfaces are generally made by controlling the surface chemistry and surface roughness of various expensive materials, which are then applied by means of complex time-consuming processes. We describe a simple and inexpensive method for forming a superhydrophobic coating using polypropylene (a simple polymer) and a suitable selection of solvents and temperature to control the surface roughness. The resulting gel-like porous coating has a water contact angle of 160 degrees. The method can be applied to a variety of surfaces as long as the solvent mixture does not dissolve the underlying material."

The concept that scrolling could lead to nanotube-like structures ([3][3]) inspired us to extend our recent work on making colloidal suspensions of layered compounds ([4][4]) to graphite."

https://openalex.org/W1964126053,"A single antibody was shown to adopt different binding-site conformations and thereby bind unrelated antigens. Analysis by both x-ray crystallography and pre-steady-state kinetics revealed an equilibrium between different preexisting isomers, one of which possessed a promiscuous, low-affinity binding site for aromatic ligands, including the immunizing hapten. A subsequent induced-fit isomerization led to high-affinity complexes with a deep and narrow binding site. A protein antigen identified by repertoire selection made use of an unrelated antibody isomer with a wide, shallow binding site. Conformational diversity, whereby one sequence adopts multiple structures and multiple functions, can increase the effective size of the antibody repertoire but may also lead to autoimmunity and allergy."
https://openalex.org/W2016774108,"Although curvature of biological surfaces has been considered from mathematical and biophysical perspectives, its molecular and developmental basis is unclear. We have studied the cin mutant of Antirrhinum, which has crinkly rather than flat leaves. Leaves of cin display excess growth in marginal regions, resulting in a gradual introduction of negative curvature during development. This reflects a change in the shape and the progression of a cell-cycle arrest front moving from the leaf tip toward the base. CIN encodes a TCP protein and is expressed downstream of the arrest front. We propose that CIN promotes zero curvature (flatness) by making cells more sensitive to an arrest signal, particularly in marginal regions."

https://openalex.org/W2121990753,"In response to a variety of stimuli, dendritic cells (DCs) transform from immature cells specialized for antigen capture into mature cells specialized for T cell stimulation. During maturation, the DCs acquire an enhanced capacity to form and accumulate peptide–MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class II complexes. Here we show that a key mechanism responsible for this alteration was the generalized activation of lysosomal function. In immature DCs, internalized antigens were slowly degraded and inefficiently used for peptide loading. Maturation induced activation of the vacuolar proton pump that enhanced lysosomal acidification and antigen proteolysis, facilitating efficient formation of peptide–MHC class II complexes. Lysosomal function in DCs thus appears to be specialized for the developmentally regulated processing of internalized antigens."
https://openalex.org/W1996263122,"Ecological theory suggests that complex food webs should not persist because of their inherent instability. ""Real"" ecosystems often support a large number of interacting species. A mathematical model shows that fluctuating short-term selection on trophic links, arising from a consumer's adaptive food choice, is a key to the long-term stability of complex communities. Without adaptive foragers, food-web complexity destabilizes community composition; whereas in their presence, complexity may enhance community persistence through facilitation of dynamical food-web reconstruction that buffers environmental fluctuations. The model predicts a linkage pattern consistent with field observations."
https://openalex.org/W2092587339,"Carbonylated proteins were visualized in single cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, revealing that they accumulate with replicative age. Furthermore, carbonylated proteins were not inherited by daughter cells during cytokinesis. Mother cells of a yeast strain lacking the sir2 gene, a life-span determinant, failed to retain oxidatively damaged proteins during cytokinesis. These findings suggest that a genetically determined, Sir2p-dependent asymmetric inheritance of oxidatively damaged proteins may contribute to free-radical defense and the fitness of newborn cells."

https://openalex.org/W2045143786,"Molecular etiologies of heart failure, an emerging cardiovascular epidemic affecting 4.7 million Americans and costing 17.8 billion health-care dollars annually, remain poorly understood. Here we report that an inherited human dilated cardiomyopathy with refractory congestive heart failure is caused by a dominant Arg → Cys missense mutation at residue 9 (R9C) in phospholamban (PLN), a transmembrane phosphoprotein that inhibits the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular Ca 2+ –adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) pump. Transgenic PLN R9C mice recapitulated human heart failure with premature death. Cellular and biochemical studies revealed that, unlike wild-type PLN, PLN R9C did not directly inhibit SERCA2a. Rather, PLN R9C trapped protein kinase A (PKA), which blocked PKA-mediated phosphorylation of wild-type PLN and in turn delayed decay of calcium transients in myocytes. These results indicate that myocellular calcium dysregulation can initiate human heart failure—a finding that may lead to therapeutic opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W2087892194,"Nonhuman primates represent the most relevant model organisms to understand the biology of Homo sapiens. The recent divergence and associated overall sequence conservation between individual members of this taxon have nonetheless largely precluded the use of primates in comparative sequence studies. We used sequence comparisons of an extensive set of Old World and New World monkeys and hominoids to identify functional regions in the human genome. Analysis of these data enabled the discovery of primate-specific gene regulatory elements and the demarcation of the exons of multiple genes. Much of the information content of the comprehensive primate sequence comparisons could be captured with a small subset of phylogenetically close primates. These results demonstrate the utility of intraprimate sequence comparisons to discover common mammalian as well as primate-specific functional elements in the human genome, which are unattainable through the evaluation of more evolutionarily distant species."
https://openalex.org/W2072278366,"Dynein ATPases are microtubule motors that are critical to diverse processes such as vesicle transport and the beating of sperm tails; however, their mechanism of force generation is unknown. Each dynein comprises a head, from which a stalk and a stem emerge. Here we use electron microscopy and image processing to reveal new structural details of dynein c, an isoform from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagella, at the start and end of its power stroke. Both stem and stalk are flexible, and the stem connects to the head by means of a linker approximately 10 nm long that we propose lies across the head. With both ADP and vanadate bound, the stem and stalk emerge from the head 10 nm apart. However, without nucleotide they emerge much closer together owing to a change in linker orientation, and the coiled-coil stalk becomes stiffer. The net result is a shortening of the molecule coupled to an approximately 15-nm displacement of the tip of the stalk. These changes indicate a mechanism for the dynein power stroke."
https://openalex.org/W1964706050,"The mechanisms that determine how folding attempts are interrupted to target folding-incompetent proteins for endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation (ERAD) are poorly defined. Here the α-mannosidase I–like protein EDEM was shown to extract misfolded glycoproteins, but not glycoproteins undergoing productive folding, from the calnexin cycle. EDEM overexpression resulted in faster release of folding-incompetent proteins from the calnexin cycle and earlier onset of degradation, whereas EDEM down-regulation prolonged folding attempts and delayed ERAD. Up-regulation of EDEM during ER stress may promote cell recovery by clearing the calnexin cycle and by accelerating ERAD of terminally misfolded polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1984672567,"Terminally misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are retrotranslocated to the cytoplasm and degraded by proteasomes through a mechanism known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). EDEM, a postulated Man8B-binding protein, accelerates the degradation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Here, EDEM was shown to interact with calnexin, but not with calreticulin, through its transmembrane region. Both binding of substrates to calnexin and their release from calnexin were required for ERAD to occur. Overexpression of EDEM accelerated ERAD by promoting the release of terminally misfolded proteins from calnexin. Thus, EDEM appeared to function in the ERAD pathway by accepting substrates from calnexin."
https://openalex.org/W2002117316,"We have identified six circumstellar silicate grains within interplanetary dust particles (IDPs). Their extrasolar origins are demonstrated by their extremely anomalous oxygen isotopic compositions. Three 17O-rich grains appear to originate from red giant or asymptotic giant branch stars. One 16O-rich grain may be from a metal-poor star. Two 16O-poor grains have unknown stellar sources. One of the grains is forsterite, and two are amorphous silicate ""GEMS"" (glass with embedded metal and sulfides), which is consistent with astronomical identifications of crystalline and amorphous silicates in the outflows of evolved stars. These observations suggest cometary origins of these IDPs and underscore the perplexing absence of silicates among circumstellar dust grains from meteorites."
https://openalex.org/W1970061319,"“Soluble” adenylyl cyclase (sAC) is a widely expressed source of cAMP in mammalian cells that is evolutionarily, structurally, and biochemically distinct from the G protein-responsive transmembrane adenylyl cyclases. In contrast to transmembrane adenylyl cyclases, sAC is insensitive to heterotrimeric G protein regulation and forskolin stimulation and is uniquely modulated by bicarbonate ions. Here we present the first report detailing kinetic analysis and biochemical properties of purified recombinant sAC. We confirm that bicarbonate regulation is conserved among mammalian sAC orthologs and demonstrate that bicarbonate stimulation is consistent with an increase in the V max of the enzyme with little effect on the apparent K m for substrate, ATP-Mg2+. Bicarbonate can further increase sAC activity by relieving substrate inhibition. We also identify calcium as a direct modulator of sAC activity. In contrast to bicarbonate, calcium stimulates sAC activity by decreasing its apparentK m for ATP-Mg2+. Because of their different mechanisms, calcium and bicarbonate synergistically activate sAC; therefore, small changes of either calcium or bicarbonate will lead to significant changes in cellular cAMP levels. “Soluble” adenylyl cyclase (sAC) is a widely expressed source of cAMP in mammalian cells that is evolutionarily, structurally, and biochemically distinct from the G protein-responsive transmembrane adenylyl cyclases.

The tmACs are plasma membrane bound, and their activities are regulated by G proteins in response to extracellular stimuli such as neurotransmitters and hormones (reviewed in Ref. 1Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In contrast, sAC is associated with various intracellular organelles, including mitochondria, centrioles, mitotic spindle, mid-bodies, and nuclei (2Zippin J.H. Chen Y. Nahirney P. Kamenetsky R. Fischman D.A. Levin L.R. Buck J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). sAC activity is modulated by bicarbonate (3Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) and, as shown in this report, by Ca2+; regulation by these intracellular signaling molecules suggests that sAC mediates cAMP-dependent responses to intrinsic cellular changes (4Wuttke M.S. Buck J. Levin L.R. JOP. 2001; 2: 154-158PubMed Google Scholar,5Zippin J.H. Levin L.R. Buck J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 366-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of tmACs has been determined from biochemical and crystallographic studies. tmACs convert ATP to cAMP using two-metal catalysis where one ion acts as a free metal and the other coordinates ATP in the active site (6Zimmermann G. Zhou D. Taussig R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19650-19655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Its activators, Gαssubunit or forskolin, stimulate tmACs by allosteric modulation of the active site (8Tesmer J.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7599-7602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). More than 25 years ago, when soluble AC activity was first discovered, it was predicted to be molecularly distinct from tmACs because its activity appeared to be dependent on the presence of the divalent cation, Mn2+, and it was insensitive to forskolin and G protein regulation (10Braun T. Dods R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1097-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 11Gordeladze J.O. Andersen D. Hansson V. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 3030-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These differential properties enabled purification (13Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and cloning of sAC from rat testis (14Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The sAC gene is indeed molecularly distinct from tmACs; it possesses no transmembrane domains, and its catalytic domains are more closely related to those of cyanobacterial ACs than to those from other eukaryotic ACs. The purified soluble AC exhibited ∼10-fold lower affinity for substrate ATP relative to tmACs (tmACK m for ATP-Mn2+ is ∼ 100 μm, whereas purified rat testis sAC K m for ATP-Mn2+ is ∼ 1 mm), and the activity of the heterologously expressed, cloned sAC gene product is insensitive to forskolin or G proteins (14Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Soluble AC, as the predominant, if not only, source of cAMP in sperm, was predicted to be responsible for the cAMP changes induced by seminal and oviductal fluids (and mimicked by in vitro fertilization (IVF) media) necessary for fertilization of an egg, capacitation, hyperactivated motility, and acrosome reaction (15Visconti P.E.

Two essential components of defined IVF media are bicarbonate and calcium, and we previously demonstrated that sAC is directly stimulated by physiological levels of the bicarbonate anion (3Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The role of calcium in IVF media is less clear because of contradicting reports detailing Ca2+ modulation of sperm cyclase (19Hyne R.V. Garbers D.L. Biol. Reprod. 1979; 21: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Garbers D.L. Tubb D.J. Hyne R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8980-8984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Stengel D. Hanoune J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1984; 438: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We performed kinetic analyses on purified recombinant 48-kDa truncated human sAC protein (sACt) fused to GST. This truncated protein corresponds to a splice variant of the sAC gene (22Jaiswal B.S. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 21: 21Google Scholar) that consists almost exclusively of the sAC catalytic domains and corresponds to the native isoform originally purified from testis cytosol (14Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). We identify a synergistic interaction between bicarbonate and calcium ions, where bicarbonate functions to increase theV max of the enzyme whereas calcium increases its affinity for substrate ATP-Mg2+. ATP, chlorpromazine, and LaCl3 were purchased from Sigma; all tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen and [α32P]ATP and [3H]cAMP were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Human sACt was subcloned using gateway cloning technology (Invitrogen) into a baculovirus expression vector utilizing the polyhedron promoter to generate an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. Recombinant GST·human sACt-expressing baculovirus was produced in adherent SF9 cells (Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression systems, Invitrogen), and identity of the resultant fusion protein was confirmed by Western blotting and enzymatic activity. Hi-Five cells, grown to a density of ∼1.0 × 106 cells per ml, were infected with GST·human sACt baculovirus. After 48 h, cells were pelleted, resuspended in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed by sonication. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 17,500 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). The GST·human sACt fusion protein was eluted with glutathione elution buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). GST·human sACt was further purified by gel filtration over Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences); sAC-containing fractions were stored in 50% glycerol at −20 °C. Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE reveals one predominant band corresponding to GST·human sACt and a minor contaminant corresponding to GST alone (Fig. 1, inset). Multiple independent assays comparing the GST·sACt fusion protein with cleaved and re-purified sACt confirmed that the GST fusion does not affect enzymatic activity or kinetic parameters of sAC (data not shown). Cyclase assays were performed in 100 μl of total reaction volume using ∼100 ng of purified GST·human sACt fusion protein in the presence of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, substrate [α-32P]ATP, and either MnCl2, MgCl2, and/or CaCl2 as indicated. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min unless otherwise noted and were stopped by adding 200 μl of 2% SDS. [32P]cAMP generated by the reaction was recovered using the two-column method (23Levin L.R. Han P.L. Hwang P.M. Feinstein P.G. Davis R.L. Reed R.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 479-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 24Levin L.R. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7573-7579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For kinetic analysis, sAC activity was assayed as a function of varying ATP-Mn2+ or ATP-Mg2+ in the presence of excess MnCl2, MgCl2, or CaCl2. ATP was preincubated with MnCl2 or MgCl2, and serial dilutions were prepared; assays were started by addition of sAC protein. Kinetic analyses were performed using the program EnzymeKinetics v 1.11 (Trinity Software, Plymouth, NH). Adenylyl cyclases require a divalent cation for catalytic activity. Historically, soluble adenylyl cyclase activity found in testis has been assayed in the presence of Mn2+ (10Braun T. Dods R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1097-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); little or no in vitro activity was detected when Mg2+, Ca2+, or Co2+ was used as the sole divalent (19Hyne R.V. Garbers D.L. Biol. Reprod. 1979; 21: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Braun T. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1975; 1: 271-281PubMed Google Scholar, 26Magnus O. Brekke I. Abyholm T. Purvis K. Arch. Androl. 1990; 24: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The K m for ATP-Mn2+ of soluble AC activity from testis cytosol has been reported to be 1–2 mm (11Gordeladze J.O. Andersen D. Hansson V. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1981; 53: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21Stengel D. Hanoune J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1984; 438: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 27Braun T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that recombinant human sAC has similar activity, displaying a K m of 0.8 mm ATP-Mn2+(Fig. 1). We recently described direct stimulation of rat sAC by the bicarbonate anion (3Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Bicarbonate activation of sAC is thought to be at the center of fertilization-related processes that occur in all mammalian sperm, and we now confirm that purified human sAC is also stimulated by bicarbonate (Fig. 2 A). Similar to rat sAC, in the presence of 10 mm ATP human sAC was stimulated up to 30-fold with a half-maximal effect (EC50) of ∼11 mm NaHCO3. Bicarbonate stimulates sAC activity in the presence of magnesium, and because manganese is not found at the millimolar concentrations necessary to support sAC activity inside cells, magnesium represents the more physiologically relevant cation. Therefore, all subsequent experiments were performed using Mg2+-ATP as substrate. In the absence of bicarbonate, activity of recombinant human sAC was inhibited at high ATP-Mg2+ concentrations. This substrate inhibition was relieved by the addition of bicarbonate (Fig.2 B). At 0 mm NaHCO3, the onset of inhibition is at [ATP-Mg2+] > 6 mm; at 15 mm NaHCO3 the onset is shifted to [ATP-Mg2+] > 13 mm and, at 50 mmNaHCO3, substrate inhibition is virtually abated. The data indicate that, in addition to relieving the inhibition observed at high substrate concentrations, bicarbonate was not altering the apparentK m for ATP-Mg2+; rather it was increasing the V max of sAC (Fig. 2 B). These 2-fold effects contribute to the observed 30-fold stimulation of activity (Fig. 2 A). Similar effects were observed with purified recombinant rat sAC; bicarbonate increased theV max of the enzyme and abated substrate inhibition (data not shown). Previously published studies of crude soluble AC activity revealed an elevated K m for ATP-Mg2+ (12–16 mm) relative to ATP-Mn2+ (1–2 mm) (21Stengel D. Hanoune J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1984; 438: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We were unable to determine a true K m for ATP-Mg2+ in the presence of NaHCO3 because even at the highest NaHCO3 (80 mm) and substrate (up to 30 mm ATP-Mg2+) concentrations used, sAC activity did not plateau (Fig. 2 C). We could only conclude from non-linear regression analysis and Eadie-Hofstee plots that the apparent K m for ATP-Mg2+ was greater than 10 mm, consistent with published reports using crude soluble AC activity (21Stengel D. Hanoune J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1984; 438: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Like bicarbonate, CaCl2 (1.7–3 mm) is an essential component ofin vitro fertilization media, and Ca2+ has been implicated along with bicarbonate in activation of sperm cyclases (12Rojas F.J. Patrizio P. Do J. Silber S. Asch R.H. Moretti-Rojas I. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 3030-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar,15Visconti P.E. Westbrook V.A. Chertihin O. Demarco I. Sleight S. Diekman A.B. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2002; 53: 133-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 16Kulanand J. Shivaji S. Andrologia. 2001; 33: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 19Hyne R.V. Garbers D.L. Biol. Reprod. 1979; 21: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We added CaCl2 to bicarbonate-stimulated sAC and found enzymatic activity increased synergistically (Fig.3 A). CaCl2activation was dose-dependent with an EC50∼750 μm (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, the dose response to NaHCO3 was unaffected by calcium; the EC50 for NaHCO3 remained ∼11 mmin the presence or absence of CaCl2 (Fig.3 C). As shown above, bicarbonate stimulated sAC activity by alleviating ATP inhibition and by increasing V max with little effect on apparent K m. In contrast, kinetic analysis revealed that calcium had no effect on ATP inhibition and little effect on V max (Fig. 3 E) but stimulated sAC activity by decreasing its apparent K m for ATP-Mg2+ (Fig. 3 D). Addition of CaCl2 causes a dramatic shift in the apparentK m of sAC for ATP-Mg2+ from greater than 10 mm (Fig. 2 B) to less than 1 mm(Fig. 3 D). Overlaying the kinetic curves (Fig.3 E) illustrates how the effects of NaHCO3 and CaCl2 differ; NaHCO3 activates sAC by increasing V max, whereas CaCl2increases its affinity for substrate. Coomassie Blue staining of purified human sAC did not reveal any substantial contaminating proteins (Fig. 1,inset), suggesting that calmodulin was not mediating the effect of calcium on sAC. To confirm that calmodulin was not involved, we found that adding exogenous bovine calmodulin did not have any affect on Ca2+-dependent sAC activity (data not shown) and inhibiting any potential calmodulin contamination using two independent calmodulin inhibitors, chlorpromazine or LaCl3, had no effect on calcium-stimulated sAC activity (Fig.4). Therefore, we conclude that the effect of CaCl2 on sAC activity is because of direct binding of Ca2+, making sAC the first mammalian adenylyl cyclase to be stimulated by calcium directly. Specific tmAC isoforms are known to be stimulated by Ca2+, but they require calmodulin for the modulatory effect (23Levin L.R. Han P.L. Hwang P.M. Feinstein P.G. Davis R.L. Reed R.R.

Soluble AC activity was first characterized in sperm and testis in the presence of MnCl2 (10Braun T. Dods R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Activity had been described in the presence of other divalents, such as Co2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, but Mn2+-dependent activity was always significantly higher (19Hyne R.V. Garbers D.L. Biol.

We purified the 48-kDa isoform of human sAC fused to GST and confirmed that its K m for ATP-Mn2+ (∼0.8 mm) was indistinguishable from the value obtained for sAC activity purified from rat testis (14Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and matched the values reported for soluble cAMP-producing activity in testis and sperm from a variety of mammals (11Gordeladze J.O.

These data confirm that the cloned sAC gene is responsible for the activities described in testis and sperm, and the kinetic parameters determined here correlate well with values established using native enzyme. However, it should be remembered that the kinetic analyses described in this study were performed on a heterologously expressed and purified enzyme; the in vivo properties of native sAC may differ because of post-translational modifications or interactions with regulatory proteins. Soluble AC appears to be ubiquitously expressed (2Zippin J.H. Chen Y. Nahirney P. Kamenetsky R. Fischman D.A. Levin L.R. Buck J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 35Sinclair M.L. Wang X.Y. Mattia M. Conti M. Buck J. Wolgemuth D.J. Levin L.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2000; 56: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and cells throughout the body do not possess concentrations of Mn2+necessary to support sAC activity. We recently demonstrated that the ATP-Mg2+-dependent activity of purified rat sAC was stimulated by bicarbonate. Among mammalian adenylyl cyclases, bicarbonate regulation was unique to sAC; tmACs were unaffected by NaHCO3 addition (3Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the human ortholog of sAC is also responsive to bicarbonate stimulation. The half-maximal effect (∼11 mm NaHCO3) is slightly lower for human sAC than the EC50 reported (25 mm NaHCO3) for rat sAC (3Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Although both EC50 for bicarbonate are within the physiological range (24–26 mm in most extracellular fluids and 10–15 mm inside cells), the difference might reflect species variation, or it could reflect differences between the two preparations; rat sAC was purified as a His6·sAC fusion protein (3Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), whereas this study uses a GST fusion protein. Bicarbonate can increase sAC activity in two ways; besides increasing enzyme velocity, bicarbonate also relieves the substrate inhibition observed at high ATP-Mg2+ concentrations. Therefore, the low (<5 mm) bicarbonate concentration in the epididymis (36Rodriguez-Martinez H. Ekstedt E. Einarsson S. Int. J. Androl. 1990; 13: 238-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 37Levine N. Marsh D.J. J. Physiol. 1971; 213: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), where sperm are stored awaiting ejaculation, would further limit sAC activity in resting spermatozoa by allowing substrate inhibition. Upon ejaculation, the higher HCO3− (25 mm) found in seminal and prostatic fluids (which induces sperm motility and initiates capacitation) would lead to large, rapid increases in cAMP because of the increased V maxof sAC and relief from substrate inhibition. Calcium (1.7–3 mm) is required in IVF media for capacitation, hyperactivated motility, and the acrosome reaction in sperm (15Visconti P.E. Westbrook V.A. Chertihin O. Demarco I. Sleight S. Diekman A.B. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2002; 53: 133-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 38Breitbart H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 187: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It is thought that Ca2+ is able to enter sperm via voltage-dependent and cyclic nucleotide gated calcium channels (39Darszon A. Labarca P. Nishigaki T. Espinosa F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 481-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) as well as the putative cation channel CatSper (40Ren D. Navarro B. Perez G. Jackson A.C. Hsu S. Shi Q. Tilly J.L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 413: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Previous reports demonstrated that detergent-dispersed adenylyl cyclase from guinea pig sperm membranes was activated by CaCl2 (0.1–1 mm) in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2 (19Hyne R.V. Garbers D.L. Biol. Reprod. 1979; 21: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and adenylyl cyclase from human epididymal sperm membranes was activated by 50 mm CaCl2 and 50 mmNaHCO3 (12Rojas F.J. Patrizio P. Do J. Silber S. Asch R.H. Moretti-Rojas I. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 3030-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the molecular identity of the AC in these preparations remained unclear. In this report we confirm that calcium directly stimulates sAC activity and that calcium functions independently from calmodulin to increase the affinity of sAC for its substrate ATP-Mg2+. Regulation by calcium, which is capable of supporting catalytic activity in the absence of Mg2+ (19Hyne R.V. Garbers D.L. Biol. Reprod. 1979; 21: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Braun T. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1975; 1: 271-281PubMed Google Scholar, 26Magnus O. Brekke I. Abyholm T. Purvis K. Arch. Androl. 1990; 24: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggests that sAC, like tmACs, utilizes two metals in its active site; however, the active center of sAC would function best with different metals. It is possible that Ca2+, which lowers the apparentK m for substrate ATP-Mg2+, would be better at coordinating ATP, while Mg2+ would serve as the catalytic metal. The EC50 for CaCl2 stimulation appears to be high (∼750 μm). However, it is important to keep in mind that CaCl2 concentrations reported in this study do not reflect free Ca2+ concentrations. sAC activity would be responsive to the transiently elevated Ca2+ concentrations found during acrosome reaction and sperm motility, or sAC could be located near the pore of Ca2+ channels, such as the cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels (39Darszon A. Labarca P. Nishigaki T. Espinosa F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 481-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), where it could mediate the cAMP regulation of channel opening. A microdomain consisting of sAC and cyclic nucleotide gated calcium channels could explain observed cAMP/calcium oscillations in cells (as proposed in Ref. 33Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Karpens J.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Because of the synergy between calcium and bicarbonate, even small intracellular changes in calcium or subtle changes in intracellular pH and/or carbon dioxide, which will be in equilibrium with bicarbonate, will result in significant changes of cellular cAMP.

Unresolved x-ray emission likely represents the shock where the winds of the pulsar and its companion collide. This emission indicates that the efficiency with which relativistic particles are accelerated in the postshock flow is similar to that for young pulsars, despite the shock proximity and much weaker surface magnetic field of this millisecond pulsar."

Previously, we have shown that these domains are necessary for transcriptional activity. To further characterize the role of these domains in transactivation, we analyzed the regulation of p21, a well characterized p53 target gene, by various p53 mutants deficient in one or more of these domains. We found that the induction of endogenous p21 is compromised by AD1-deficient p53 (p53(AD1−)), AD2-deficient p53 (p53(AD2−)), both AD1- and AD2-deficient p53 (p53(AD1−AD2−)), p53(ΔPRD), which lacks PRD, and p53(ΔBD), which lacks BD. However, p53(AD2−), p53(ΔPRD), and p53(ΔBD) are still capable of activating exogenous p21 promoter to an extent comparable with that by wild-type p53. Thus, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to measure the DNA binding ability of various p53 mutants in vivo. We found that like wild-type p53, these p53 mutants are capable of binding to the p53 response elements in the p21 promoter. In contrast, we found that the extent of acetylated histones on the p21 promoter, especially the proximal promoter, and the amount of interaction with p300/CREB-binding protein, which contain histone acetyltransferase activity, directly correlate with the activity of p53 to induce endogenous p21. Furthermore, we showed that down-regulation of p300/CBP by short interference RNA markedly decreases the ability of p53 to induce endogenous p21. These data lead us to hypothesize that when p53 binds to the responsive element(s) of a target gene, its ability to interact with histone acetyltransferase-containing proteins and subsequently the acetylation of histones bound to the proximal promoter dictate the induction level of a target gene.

The basic structural unit is the nucleosome, consisting of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histones (two each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The packaged nucleosome is the natural barrier to most regulatory proteins due to restriction of access to DNA (1Cosma M. Mol.

Therefore, activation of transcription requires disruption of the highly dense structure of chromatin to increase the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors. It is believed that disruption of chromatin structure depends on chromatin-modifying complexes, which include two major groups, the ATP-dependent remodeling complexes and the histone modification enzymes. Histone acetyltransferase is one of the well characterized histone modification enzymes that acetylates histone tails and introduces negative charge to histones, thereby reducing the interaction between histones and DNA and promoting accessibility of DNA to the transcriptional machinery (3Kadam S. Emerson B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Therefore, increased acetylation of histones on promoters often leads to transcriptional activation. In mammalian cells the histone acetyltransferase-containing transcription co-activators p300/CBP1 and PCAF acetylate histones after being recruited by sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors (7Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). This is underscored by evidence that p300/CBP can interact with many transcription factors, such as c-Jun, JunB, JunD, MyoD, STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription), and p53, and increase the transcriptional activity of these proteins (7Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequent target for genetic alterations in human cancers, with mutations occurring in almost 507 of all human tumors (8Hollstein M. Rice K. Greenblatt M.S.

In response to environmental and intracellular stresses, including DNA damage, ionizing irradiation, and hypoxia, p53 is rapidly stabilized and accumulated (10Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). The activated p53 induces many target genes, including p21, Bax, PUMA, and MCG10, which mediate p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis (11el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B.

The p53 protein consists of two N-terminal activation domains (AD1 within residues 1–42 and AD2 within residues 43–63), a proline-rich domain (PRD, within residues 64–93), a sequence-specific DNA binding domain (within residues 102–292), and an extreme C-terminal basic domain (BD within residues 364–393) (16Chen X.

Mutant p53 with a double point mutation in AD1 and AD2, each of which is deficient in transactivation, is unable to interact with CBP in vitro(21Scolnick D.M. Chehab N.H. Stavridi E.S. Lien M.C. Caruso L. Moran E. Berger S.L. Halazonetis T.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3693-3696PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the oncoprotein E1A suppresses p53-dependent induction of p21, probably through disruption of the interaction between CBP and p53 (20Lill N.L. Grossman S.R. Ginsberg D. DeCaprio J. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). All this evidence suggests that the transcriptional activity of p53 depends on its interaction with p300/CBP. The C terminus of p53 has been shown to play a critical role in regulation of p53 functions. For example, the DNA binding ability of p53 is increased after deletion of the C-terminal domain, phosphorylation of serine residues in this domain, or binding of an antibody specific to this domain (10Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). More recent studies show that p300/CBP and PCAF can acetylate lysine residues within the C-terminal domain in response to p53-activating agents (22Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K.

In this study, we used stable cell lines to analyze differential regulation of p21 by wild-type p53 or various mutants. We showed that although all of the p53 mutants used in this assay are compromised in inducing endogenous p21 gene, both wild-type p53 and various p53 mutants have an equivalent sequence-specific DNA binding ability. We found that the ability of p53 mutants to increase acetylation of histones H3 and H4 is impaired. We also found that the compromised transcriptional activity of p53 mutants correlates with the acetylation level of histones H3 and H4 on the region proximal to the TATA box. We used the RNA interference technique to confirm and extend the previous observation that p300/CBP is required for the transcriptional activity of wild-type p53. Furthermore, we provided evidence that compromised transcriptional activity of various p53 mutants correlates with their decreased interaction with p300/CBP. Therefore, our data suggest that the amount of p300/CBP recruited by p53 and the extent of acetylated histones bound to the proximal promoter can in part explain the differential transcriptional activity among wild-type p53 and various p53 mutants. H1299 cell lines, which can be induced to express wild-type p53, p53(R249S), p53(AD1−), p53(AD2−), p53(AD1−AD2−), p53(ΔBD), and p53(ΔPRD), were described previously (28Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Zhu K.

For an internal control, 25 ng of theRenilla luciferase vector, pRL-CMV (Promega, Madison, WI), was cotransfected. Dual luciferase assays were performed in triplicate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Small portions of cells, which were used for RNA isolation or luciferase assay, were lysed with 2× SDS sample buffer (33Liu G. Chen X. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7195-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Protein was resolved by 87 SDS-PAGE gel. The expression level of wild-type p53, p53(AD2−), p53(AD1−AD2−), p53(ΔBD), and p53(ΔPRD) in stable cell lines or transiently transfected cells was detected by anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz). p53(R249S) and p53(AD1−) were detected by pAb1801 and pAb421. Actin was also detected to ensure an equal loading. 1 × 108 H1299 cells, which were uninduced (−) and induced (+) to express p53, p53(R249S), p53(AD1−), p53(AD2−), p53(AD1−AD2−), p53(ΔBD), or p53(ΔPRD), were washed 3 times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Genomic DNA and proteins were cross-linked by the addition of formaldehyde (17 final concentration) directly into culture medium and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The cross-linked cells on plates were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline three times and collected by scraping. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended with 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (17 SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.1, proteinase inhibitor mixture), and sonicated to generate 200–1000-bp DNA fragments. After clearance by centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted 10-fold with a dilution buffer (17 Triton-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, proteinase inhibitor mixture) and incubated with anti-p53, anti-acetylated histone H3, and anti-acetylated histone H4, respectively, at 4 °C overnight. The immunocomplexes were captured by protein A beads saturated with salmon sperm DNA. The beads that contained various immunocomplexes were washed sequentially with TSE buffer (0.17 SDS, 17 Triton-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) containing 150 mm NaCl, TSE containing 500 mm NaCl, buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 17 Nonidet P-40, 17 sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA). The immunocomplexes were then eluted with the elution buffer (17 SDS, 0.1m NaHCO3) for 15 min at the room temperature. The DNA-protein cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform and precipitated by ethanol and resuspended in 50 ॖl of TE. 2.5 ॖl of DNA sample was used as a template for PCR amplification. To amplify the regions containing p53-responsive element 1 (RE1) and RE2 and the region proximal to TATA box in the p21 promoter, PCRs were performed with the following pairs of primers: p53 RE1, forward primer, 5′-CAGGCTGTGGCTCTGATTGG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TTCAGAGTAACAGGCTAAGG-3′; p53 RE2, forward primer, 5′-GGTCTGCTACTGTGTCCTCC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CATCTGAACAGAAATCCCAC-3′; p21 TATA, forward primer, 5′-TATTGTGGGGCTGTTCTGGA-3′, and reverse primer 5′-CTGTTAGAATGAGCCCCCTTT-3′. The U6 RNA polymerase III promoter was derived from cleavage of plasmid LS9/Hae/RA.2 (34Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Cell. 1989; 58: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) withHincII. The fragment containing the U6 promoter was cloned into the SmaI site of plasmid pBluescript to obtain anEcoRI and a BamH1 site. The U6 promoter fragment was then excised with EcoRI and BamH1 and cloned into plasmid pBabe. The resulting plasmid was named as pBabe-U6. Selected siRNA oligos were then cloned into pBabe-U6 atBamHI and XhoI sites for expression of siRNAin vivo. Two pairs of siRNA oligos from both p300 and CBP were synthesized and cloned into pBabe-U6, and the resulting plasmids were designated as pBabe-U6-p300-1, pBabe-U6-p300-2, pBabe-U6-CBP-1, and pBabe-U6-CBP-2, respectively. The siRNA oligos cloned in pBabe-U6-p300-1 (shown in bold, derived from the p300 gene from +370 to +389) are: sense, 5′-TCGAGGTCCGCCCAATGACACAGGCAGGCttcaagagaGCCTGCCTGTGTCATTGGGCTTTTTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GATCCAAAAAGCCCAATGACACAGGCAGGCtctcttgaaGCCTGCCTGTGTCATTGGGCGGACC-3′. The siRNA oligos cloned in pBabe-U6-p300-2 (derived from the p300 gene from +1008 to +1027) are: sense, 5′-TCGAGGTCCGCTCATCCAGCAGCAGCTTGttcaagagaCAAGCTGCTGCTGGATGAGCTTTTTG-3′, and antisense 5′-GATCCAAAAAGCTCATCCAGCAGCAGCTTGtctcttgaaCAAGCTGCTGCTGGATGAGCGGACC-3′. The siRNA oligos cloned in pBabe-U6-CBP-1 (derived from the CBP gene from +3510 to +3528) are: sense, 5′-TCGAGGTCCGACATCCCGAGTCTATAAGttcaagagaCTTATAGACTCGGGATGTCTTTTTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GATCCAAAAAGACATCCCGAGTCTATAAGtctcttgaaCTTATAGACTCGGGATGTCGGACC-3′. The siRNA oligos cloned in pBabe-U6-CBP-2 (derived from the CBP gene from +4430 to +4449) are: sense, 5′-TCGAGGTCCGTGAAGGAGATGATTACATCttcaagagaGATGTAATCATCTCCTTCACTTTTT-3′, and antisense, 5′-GATCCAAAAAGTGAAGGAGATGATTACATCtctcttgaaGATGTAATCATCTCCTTCACGGACC-3′. H1299 cells were transfected with the mixture of 0.5 ॖg of each of pBabe-U6-p300-1, pBabe-U6-p300-2, pBabe-U6-CBP-1, and pBabe-U6-CBP-2 alone or together with 0.1 ॖg of pcDNA3-HAp53. H1299 cells were also transfected with 2 ॖg of control pBabe-U6 or pcDNA3 alone or together with 0.1 ॖg of pcDNA3-HAp53. The cell extracts were collected on the second day after transfection. The level of p300, CBP, p53, and p21 was detected by anti-p300 (Santa Cruz), anti-CBP (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-p53 (pAb1801 and pAb421), and anti-p21 (Santa Cruz), respectively. Actin was also detected to ensure an equal loading. Approximately 2 × 108 H1299 cells were induced to express wild-type p53, p53(AD1−), p53(AD2−), p53(AD1−AD2−), p53(ΔBD), or p53(ΔPRD). Cells were washed 3 times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected by scraping. The collected cells were resuspended in 20 ml of hypotonic buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 × proteinase inhibitor mixture, 50 mm NaF) and placed on ice for 8 min. Nonidet P-40 was then added to cell extracts to the final concentration of 0.17. Cell extracts were placed on ice for another 8 min. After centrifugation, the cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of 0.17 Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.17 Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl) and frozen and thawed 3 times. The extracts were precleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Wild-type p53, p53(AD2−), p53(AD1−AD2−), p53(ΔBD), and p53(ΔPRD) were captured by incubation with 80 ॖl of monoclonal anti-HA-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. p53(AD1−) was captured by 80 ॖl of anti-p53 (pAb1801 and pAb421)-conjugated protein A beads. The beads were washed 5 times with 0.17 Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and p53 was eluted using 60 ॖl of 2× SDS sample buffer at 100 °C for 8 min. The amount of CBP or p300 co-immunoprecipitated with p53 or various mutants was detected by Western blot analysis. In the process of delineating p53 functional domains, we generated a number of cell lines that could be induced to express wild-type p53 or various p53 mutants. We found that the level of p21 induced by p53 in these cell lines varied (28Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Zhu K. Chen X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2149-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29Zhu J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39927-39934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To systematically analyze the induction of p21 in these cell lines, we performed Northern blot analyses and compared the level of p21 induction. We found that p21 was strongly induced in the presence of wild-type p53. In contrast, p53(R249S), which is mutated in the DNA binding domain, was inert in up-regulation of p21 (Fig.1A), consistent with the previous finding (36Zhu K., J., W. Zhu J. Jiang J. Shou J. Chen X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7740-7747Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We also found that induction of p21 was diminished by mutation of activation domain I (p53(AD1−)) or activation domain II (p53(AD2−)) (Fig. 1A), suggesting that both AD1 and AD2 are important to, if not necessary for, the transcriptional activity of p53. This was further supported by the evidence that simultaneous double point mutations in both AD1 and AD2 abrogated the induction of p21 (Fig. 1A). In addition, p53(ΔBD), which lacks the C-terminal basic domain, and p53(ΔPRD), which lacks the proline-rich domain, had a reduced activity in inducing p21 (Fig. 1A), although both mutants are capable of inducing cell cycle arrest (29Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13030-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 35Zhu J. Zhang S. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39927-39934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that differential transcriptional activity of wild-type p53 and various p53 mutants on p21 was due to different expression level of p53 in these stable cell lines, we performed Western blot analysis and found that the level of these p53 mutants was comparable with that of wild-type p53 (Fig. 1B). The activity of luciferase under the control of a responsive element of a transcription factor has been widely used to measure the transcriptional activity (37Nozell S. Chen X. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here, we used a luciferase reporter under the control of the p21 promoter containing two p53-responsive elements to determine the transcriptional activity of wild-type p53 and various p53 mutants. We found that p53(R249S) was inactive, and p53(AD1−) and p53(AD1−AD2−) showed a very weak transcriptional activity on the p21 promoter (Fig.1C). However, p53(AD2−) significantly activated the p21 promoter (Fig. 1C), which is different from the result obtained by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1A,p21 panel). Additionally, we found that p53(ΔBD) and p53(ΔPRD) had equivalent, if not more, transcriptional activity on the p21 promoter compared with wild-type p53 (Fig. 1C). That both mutants induced much less endogenous p21 than wild-type p53 (Fig.1A, p21 panel) suggests the luciferase assay does not faithfully reveal the transcriptional activity of p53 and various mutants in inducing the endogenous p21 gene. This is not surprising since a transiently transfected promoter is more accessible to an activator than the same endogenous promoter. To ensure an equivalent expression level of wild-type p53 and various p53 mutants, we also performed Western blot analysis and found that their expression was comparable (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, we determined the level of endogenous p21 induced by transiently expressed wild-type p53 and various mutants (Fig. 1D, p21 panel). We found that p21 was highly induced by wild-type p53, but little, if any, by p53(R249S), p53(AD1−), p53(AD2−), p53(AD1−AD2−), and p53(ΔPRD). Although p21 was slightly induced by p53(ΔBD), the level of its induction was significantly less by p53(ΔBD) than by wild-type p53. This is consistent with the data observed in the stable cell lines (Fig.1A). Except the tumor-derived mutant p53(R249S), all of the mutants used in this study have an intact DNA binding domain. Because the DNA binding ability of p53 is necessary for, and correlated with, p53 transcriptional activity (10Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar, 16Chen X. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 387-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar), it is possible that some p53 mutants have an altered DNA binding ability, which leads to decreased induction of endogenous p21. To test this, we used ChIP-PCR to investigate the ability of wild-type p53 and various mutants to bind the p53-responsive elements in the p21 promoter. Because two p53-responsive elements (RE1 and RE2) exist in the p21 promoter (Fig.2A), we designed two pairs of primers to amplify them separately. We found that anti-p53 antibodies (pAb1801 and pAb421) were able to pull down both RE1 and RE2 in the p21 promoter when wild-type p53 was expressed. However, neither RE1 nor RE2 was captured by a control antibody (Fig. 2, B andD), suggesting that wild-type p53 specifically binds both RE1 and RE2. We also found that p53(AD1−), p53(AD2−), and p53(AD1−AD2−) had an equivalent ability to bind RE1 and RE2 compared with wild-type p53 (Fig. 2, B–E). These results are not surprising since mutations in either AD1 or AD2 do not affect the specific DNA binding ability of p53. Furthermore, both p53(ΔBD) and p53(ΔPRD) had an equivalent ability to bind both RE1 and RE2 as wild-type p53 (Fig. 2,B–E), although their ability to induce p21 was significantly diminished. In addition, we also used anti-HA antibody to capture p53(ΔBD)-DNA complex in the ChIP assay, and similar results were obtained (data not shown). As expected, p53(R249S), which had a mutation in the p53 DNA binding domain, was incapable of binding RE1 or RE2 (Fig. 2, B–E). When transcription factors bind to specific sequences within a promoter, they often recruit a co-activator with histone acetyltransferase activity to the promoter, leading to acetylation of the N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4. Acetylation can disrupt the interaction of core histones with DNA, thereby increasing the accessibility of the promoter to the basal transcriptional machinery and facilitating the initiation of transcription (3Kadam S. Emerson B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 4Featherstone M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because the ability of p53 mutants to bind both RE1 and RE2 in the p21 promoter was not compromised, we decided to determine whether wild-type p53 and various mutants can equivalently increase the acetylation of histones on the regions containing RE1 and RE2. As shown in Fig.3, A and C, acetylation of histones H3 and H4 on both RE1 and RE2 was increased significantly when wild-type p53 was expressed, suggesting that wild-type p53 can recruit histone acetyltransferases to RE1 and RE2. However, the ability of p53(AD1−), p53(AD2−), or p53(AD1−AD2−) to increase acetylation of histones H3 and H4 on both RE1 and RE2 was severely compromised compared with wild-type p53 (Fig. 3, A–D). This indicates that these mutants probably recruit less histone acetyltransferase activity to RE1 and RE2 than wild-type p53 despite showing equivalent DNA binding ability as wild-type p53. This is further supported by our finding that the ability of p53(ΔBD) or p53(ΔPRD) to increase acetylation of histones H3 and H4 on both RE1 and RE2 was also impaired, albeit to a lesser extent than that of p53(AD1−), p53(AD2−), or p53(AD1−AD2−) (Fig. 3,A–D). Nevertheless, once p53 binds to its responsive element, histones bound on the region containing the responsive element become accessible for acetylation. Interestingly, we noticed that histone H3 was always acetylated to a higher extent than histone H4 regardless of whether wild-type p53 or various mutants were induced (Fig. 3, B and D, compare histones H3 and H4 panels). The exposure of the proximal promoter, including the TATA box, to the basal transcriptional machinery is a prerequisite for transcriptional initiation (2Emerson B.M. Cell. 2002; 109: 267-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5Woychik N.A. Hampsey M. Cell. 2002; 108: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). One of the critical processes of chromatin structural disruption is acetylation of histones on the proximal promoter containing the TATA box. Because some p53 mutants, such as p53(AD1−AD2−), were deficient in inducing endogenous p21 but still showed some, although compromised, activity to increase the acetylation of histones on RE1 and RE2 (Fig.3), we examined whether these p53 mutants are capable of increasing acetylation of histones on the region proximal to the TATA box. As shown in Fig. 4, A–B, acetylation of both histones H3 and H4 on the proximal p21 promoter was significantly increased when wild-type p53 was induced. Acetylation of histone H3 was also increased upon induction of p53(ΔBD) or p53(ΔPRD) (Fig. 4, A–B), although to a lesser extent than that after induction of wild-type p53. However, little, if any, increase in histone H3 or H4 acetylation was found when p53(AD1−), p53(AD2−), or p53(AD1−AD2−) was induced (Fig. 4,A–B). Thus, upon p53 expression, the extent of histone acetylation on the proximal p21 promoter correlates with the degree of induction of the endogenous p21 gene. p300 and CBP, two histone acetyltransferase-containing co-activators, have been found to physiologically interact with p53 and increase the ability of p53 to induce endogenous p21 or activate promoters of several p53 target genes (17Avantaggiati M.L.

Nature. 1997; 387: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). A recent study also showed that the amount of p300/CBP binding to the p21 promoter correlates with the level of acetylation of histones H3 and H4 (22Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), indicating that the recruitment of p300/CBP to the p21 promoter by p53 is probably responsible for histone acetylation and subsequent activation of p21. To address what roles p300/CBP play in the p53-dependent induction of p21, we used siRNAs targeting the p300/CBP mRNAs. We found that p300/CBP were specifically knocked down upon transfection of plasmids expressing p300/CBP siRNAs (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 4) but not a control plasmid (lanes 2and 5). Interestingly, we found that the ability of wild-type p53 to induce p21 was much less in cells lacking p300/CBP than in control cells (Fig. 5, compare lane 1 withlanes 2–3). Thus, our data are consistent with, and extend, the previous finding that the dominant-negative CBP decreases the induction of endogenous p21 by p53 (21Scolnick D.M. Chehab N.H. Stavridi E.S. Lien M.C. Caruso L. Moran E. Berger S.L. Halazonetis T.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3693-3696PubMed Google Scholar). Our study showed that down-regulation of p300/CBP impairs the induction of endogenous p21 by wild-type p53 (Fig. 5). Additionally, we showed that p53 mutants, which are compromised in inducing p21, are also compromised in increasing the acetylation of histones on the p21 promoter (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4). These findings prompt us to determine whether the compromised ability of various p53 mutants to increase the acetylation of histones on the p21 promoter and to induce p21 is due to their decreased interaction with p300/CBP. To test this, we performed immunoprecipitation with anti-HA or anti-p53 antibodies to capture p53-p300/CBP complexes and Western blot analysis with anti-CBP and anti-p300 antibodies to detect the amount of p300/CBP in the p53 immunocomplexes (Fig. 6). We found that wild-type p53 and p300/CBP interacted in vivo (Fig. 6,lane 1), consistent with the previous observation (17Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kelly K. Cell. 1997; 89: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 20Lill N.L. Grossman S.R. Ginsberg D. DeCaprio J. Livingston D.M.

In addition, we found that p53(ΔBD) and p53(ΔPRD) were capable of interacting with p300/CBP (Fig. 6A). However, the amount of p300/CBP interacting with these two mutants was much less than that interacting with wild-type p53 (Fig. 6, A,C, and D), although the amount of wild-type p53 and various p53 mutants in the immunocomplexes was comparable (Fig.6B). In contrast, p53(AD1−), p53(AD2−), and p53(AD1−AD2−) showed almost no interaction with p300/CBP (Fig. 6, A,C, and D). This suggests that mutations in AD1 and AD2 and deletions of PRD and BD decrease the interaction between p53 and p300/CBP, although such mutations and deletions do not interfere with the sequence-specific DNA binding ability of p53. We would like to note that the amount of p300/CBP, which interacts with wild-type p53 and various mutants, is nearly proportional to the extent of histone acetylation on the proximal p21 promoter (compare Fig.4B with Fig. 6, C–D). The transcriptional activity of p53 is regulated by various functional domains in p53 (10Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar, 16Chen X. Mol.

Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5850) Google Scholar). Because most tumor-derived p53 mutants have a mutation in the DNA binding domain that inevitably leads to p53 dysfunction (10Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar, 40Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar, 41Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), many studies have focused on whether various domains in p53 regulate the sequence-specific DNA binding activity of the core DNA binding domain. Indeed, several different experimental approaches have shown that the extreme C-terminal basic domain regulates the activity of the core DNA binding domain in vitro. For example, the core DNA binding activity is increased when the basic domain is deleted, phosphorylated, acetylated, or bound by a peptide or an anti-p53 antibody (10Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar, 19Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). These data lead to a hypothesis that p53 exists in two states, latent and active (42Ahn J. Prives C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, a recent NMR study indicated that both latent and active forms of p53 are identical in conformation (43Ayed A. Mulder F.A. Yi G.S. Lu Y. Kay L.E. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), suggesting that the basic domain may not have any effect on the DNA binding domain. In this study, we directly tested the DNA binding activity in vivo and showed that the core DNA binding activity is not affected by the basic domain (Fig. 2). In addition, we found that p53(ΔPRD), p53(AD1−), p53(AD2−), and p53(AD1−AD2−), all of which contain an intact core DNA binding domain, have an unaltered DNA binding ability (Fig. 2). Because these p53 mutants are compromised in the transcriptional activity, especially in inducing endogenous p21, the question is posed of what is responsible for their deficiency? Disruption of the dense chromatin structure by chromatin remodeling complexes is a prerequisite for transcriptional activation (1Cosma M. Mol.

Recently, several studies demonstrate that p53 physically interacts with p300/CBP both in vitro and in vivo, and co-expression of p300/CBP can potentiate p53 to activate the p21 promoter (17Avantaggiati M.L.

A dominant-negative CBP mutant is able to impair the p53-dependent induction of endogenous p21 (21Scolnick D.M. Chehab N.H. Stavridi E.S. Lien M.C. Caruso L. Moran E. Berger S.L. Halazonetis T.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3693-3696PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a double-point mutation in the activation domain 1 or the activation domain 2, which abolishes the transcriptional activity of p53, also abolishes the interaction of p53 with CBP in vitro(21Scolnick D.M.

Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have analyzed histone acetylation on the p21 promoter upon expression of p53 in vivo. We found that when p53 binds to the responsive elements in the p21 promoter, histone acetylation on the region proximal to the p21 promoter is nearly proportional to the extent of p21 induction by wild-type p53 and various mutants. Furthermore, we found that the extent of histone acetylation on the proximal p21 promoter is also proportional to the amount of p300/CBP that interacts with wild-type p53 and various mutants. Additionally, we found that down-regulation of p300/CBP can lead to impairment of p53-dependent induction of endogenous p21. Thus, our data extend the previous observations and show for the first time that both activation domains in p53 are necessary for interacting with p300/CBP in vivo, histone acetylation on the proximal p21 promoter, and subsequently, the promoter accessibility. Furthermore, we found that although the basic domain and the proline-rich domain are not essential for the interaction between p53 and p300/CBP, both domains do influence the extent of this interaction in vivo and, subsequently, histone acetylation and the promoter accessibility. We also mention that histone acetylation on the region surrounding the p53-responsive elements in the p21 promoter is increased by p53(AD1−AD2−) (Fig. 3), but the mutant is almost completely deficient in inducing p21 (Fig. 1A) and in interacting with p300/CBP (Fig. 6, A, C, andD). These data suggest that once this mutant binds to the p53-responsive elements, it alters the chromatin structure of these local regions, which concurrently allows for access of some histone acetyltransferase-containing proteins, and subsequently, the acetylation of histones in these regions. However, these histone acetyltransferase-containing proteins are not enough to spread the acetylation to the region proximal to the p21 promoter. Because the proximal promoter is the region to which the basal transcriptional machinery binds, lack of chromatin remodeling on, and subsequently, lack of accessibility of, the proximal p21 promoter are probably responsible for the deficiency of p53(AD1−AD2−) to induce endogenous p21.

We show that औ1γ2 is poorly targeted to the PM and predominantly localized to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes when expressed in HEK293 cells, but co-expression of a G protein α subunit allows strong PM localization of the औ1γ2. Furthermore, C-terminal isoprenylation of the γ subunit is necessary but not sufficient for PM localization of औ1γ2. Isoprenylation of γ2 and localization of औ1γ2to the ER occurs independently of α expression. Efficient PM localization of औ1γ2 in the absence of co-expressed α is observed when a site for palmitoylation, a putative second membrane targeting signal, is introduced into γ2. When a mutant of αs is targeted to mitochondria, औ1γ2 follows, consistent with an important role for α in promoting subcellular localization of औγ. Furthermore, we directly demonstrate the requirement for α by showing that disruption of heterotrimer formation by the introduction of α binding mutations into औ1 impedes PM targeting of औ1γ2. The results indicate that two membrane targeting signals, lipid modification and α binding, make concerted contributions to PM localization of औγ.

The औγ complex only dissociates when denatured and hence is a functional monomer under physiological conditions. Upon receptor activation the औγ dimer is freed from GTP-bound α and relays signals to downstream molecules until it reassociates with GDP-bound α, re-forming the heterotrimer. To perpetuate this G protein cycle, the trimer must be tethered to the cytoplasmic face of the PM. This crucial subcellular localization is promoted by the covalent attachment of lipids to the subunits. Three lipid modifications have been found in G proteins, namely myristoylation and/or palmitoylation for the α subunit and isoprenylation for the γ subunit. Myristoylation is the covalent attachment of a 14-carbon saturated myristate to an N-terminal glycine through an amide bond, whereas palmitoylation is a 16-carbon saturated palmitate linked to a cysteine via a thioester bond. Isoprenylation is a lipid modification in which an unsaturated, 15-carbon farnesyl isoprenoid or 20-carbon geranylgeranyl isoprenoid is linked to a cysteine, via a thioether bond. Mechanisms underlying the PM targeting of the α subunit have been studied in some detail (1Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 2Wedegaertner P.B. Biol. Signals Recept. 1998; 7: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 3Chen C.A. Manning D.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The available data suggest a model in which myristoylation and/or binding to औγ subunits constitutes an initial membrane targeting signal for the α subunit. Subsequently, palmitoylation functions as a second signal that specifies localization to the PM. In contrast to the α subunit, relatively less is known about how औγ is targeted to the PM. Either a 15-carbon farnesyl or 20-carbon geranylgeranyl isoprenoid is linked to a cysteine residue in the so-called CAAX motif in the C terminus of the γ subunit (4Gelb M.H. Scholten J.D. Sebolt-Leopold J.S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 5Fu H.W. Casey P.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1999; 54: 315-343PubMed Google Scholar). The CAAX box (where C is a cysteine,A is commonly an aliphatic amino acid, and X can be one of several amino acids) is a consensus sequence for isoprenylation. The X residue is thought to specify which isoprenoid group will be linked to the cysteine. Among 12 human γ subunits thus far identified, γ1, γ9, and γ11 have serine in the X position and are farnesylated, and the rest of them have leucine and are modified with a geranylgeranyl group. It has been generally agreed that isoprenylation of the γ subunit is essential in PM targeting of the dimer but whether the modification is sufficient has not been defined. Other prenylated proteins, such as members of the Ras family of small GTPases, require an additional second signal for their PM targeting (6Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar,7Hancock J.F. Cadwallader K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). H-Ras and N-Ras are palmitoylated at cysteines upstream of the prenylcysteine, whereas K-Ras contains polybasic lysines adjacent to the CAAX box. Ste18p, the γ subunit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is modified with palmitate at the cysteine immediately next to the prenylcysteine (8Hirschman J.E. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7705-7711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of the human γ have such cysteines or a stretch of basic residues flanking its CAAX motif. Previously we found that the औγ complex was localized poorly to the PM when transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, whereas co-expression of the α subunit led to strong PM localization of औγ (9Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Siderovski D.P. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23945-23953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This suggests that the complete information required for efficient PM targeting of औγ is not contained within the औγ dimer, and interaction of the औγ dimer with the α subunit is critical for PM targeting of औγ. In this report, we examined the importance of the α subunit in PM targeting of औγ. We show that isoprenylation of the γ subunit is necessary but not sufficient for PM localization of औγ, and expression of α is not required for γ isoprenylation. We demonstrate that introduction of an additional membrane targeting signal into the γ subunit can overcome the reliance of औγ on α for PM targeting. In addition, औγ accompanies an α subunit mis-targeted to mitochondria. Finally, we present the first direct test of the necessity for heterotrimer assembly for PM localization of औγ by demonstrating that α binding-deficient mutants of औγ fail to localize to the PM, even when co-expressed with α. The results presented herein are consistent with a model in which both heterotrimer assembly and lipid modifications, working in concert, target औγ and α to the PM.

Bourne (University of California, San Francisco). γ2F66C, γ2F67C, and γ2C68S were made from γ2 (no tag) using the QuickChange kit and so was Myc-tagged γ2C68S. A mitochondrial targeting sequence was excised from γ2MITO and inserted into wild type αs (HA-tagged) to create αs fused with mitochondrial targeting sequence (mito-αs). pcDNA3 containing His-tagged औ1 was provided by Tohru Kozasa (University of Illinois, Chicago). Unless otherwise noted, cells were seeded 1 day before transfection, and 1 ॖg of total plasmid DNA at a 6:3:1 ratio of α:औ:γ was transfected into the cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Cells were incubated overnight, transferred to new plates, and grown for 24 h prior to subsequent manipulation. Cells were fixed with 3.77 formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min and permeabilized by incubation in blocking buffer (2.57 nonfat milk and 17 Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline) for 20 min. Cells were then incubated with the indicated primary antibodies in blocking buffer for 1 h. The cells were washed with blocking buffer and incubated in a 1:250 dilution of a goat anti-mouse or a goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with either Alexa 488 or Alexa 594 for 30 min. The coverslips were washed with 17 Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline, rinsed in distilled water, and mounted on glass slides with Prolong Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Microscopy was performed with an Olympus BX60 microscope. Images were recorded with a Sony DKC-5000 digital camera and transferred to Adobe Photoshop for digital processing. Coverslips were prepared for confocal microscopy as described above under “Immunofluorescence Microscopy.” Representative images were recorded by confocal microscopy at the Kimmel Cancer Center Bioimaging Facility using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser scanning confocal microscope running CoMos 7.0a software and interfaced to a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope with Zeiss Plan-Apo 63 × 1.40 NA oil immersion objective. Dual-labeled samples were analyzed using simultaneous excitation at 488 and 568 nm. Images of “x-y” sections through the middle of a cell were recorded. Transfected cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 17 Nonidet P-40, 0.57 sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 2 ॖg/ml aprotinin). After 1 h of incubation on ice, nuclei and insoluble material were removed by centrifugation. Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) were added to the clarified lysate, and the samples were tumbled for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were washed three times and eluted with elution buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Eluates were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce). These experiments utilized the hexahistidine tag of N-terminal Myc-His-tagged औ1. COS7 cells were seeded in 60-mm culture plates. 24 h later the cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids (Myc-His tagged औ1 and non-tagged γ2 without or with HA-tagged αs). Cells were incubated overnight and labeled with 50 ॖCi/ml [3H]mevalolactone (American Radiolabeled Chemical, St. Louis, MO) for another 18 h in the presence of 10 ॖmmevastatin (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed. The औγ complex was pulled down and purified using Ni-NTA agarose beads as described above. Eluates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was sprayed with EnHance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and then exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences) at −80 °C for 8–15 days. After fluorography, the γ2 subunit was detected by immunoblotting. Note that because an anti-γ2polyclonal antibody did not recognize γ2C68S, His-tagged औ1 (12Li Y. Sternweis P.M. Charnecki S.

Soluble and particulate fractions were isolated as described previously (10Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol.

Briefly, 48 h after transfection HEK293 cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 5 ॖg/ml aprotinin). Cells were passed through a 27-gauge needle 10 times. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the indicated antibody. pEYFP-Mito vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was provided by Emad Alnemri (Thomas Jefferson University). pEYFP-IBV-M1 encoding an ER marker protein was a generous gift from Mark R. Philips (New York University). 9E10 monoclonal antibody was from Covance (Berkeley, CA). 12CA5 monoclonal antibody was from Roche Applied Science. Anti-HA and anti-γ2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). In the present study, we focused on the αsऔ1γ2 G protein heterotrimer. Immunofluorescence microscopy was utilized to examine the subcellular localization of the α and औγ subunits. It has been shown that αs is predominantly localized to the PM when expressed alone (9Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Siderovski D.P. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23945-23953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As described by us previously (10Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), when औ1 and γ2 were expressed together in HEK293 cells very little PM localization was observed (Fig.1, a and b). However, when αs was co-expressed with औ1and γ2, αs and औ1 strongly co-localized at the PM (Fig. 1, c and d). Expression of αq also strongly promoted PM localization of औ1γ2 (not shown). γ2displayed PM localization when αs, औ1, and γ2 were all expressed together, but γ2 was also found intracellularly and not co-localizing with αsor औ1 (Fig. 1, e–h). Apparently some of the γ2 did not form a dimer with औ1. Because localization of औ1 rather than γ2 appeared to be a better representative of the औ1γ2complex, most of the experiments described herein followed the localization of औ1. The C terminus of the γ2 subunit contains the CAAX motif, specifically the sequence of cysteine, alanine, isoleucine, and leucine. The cysteine is modified with a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl isoprenoid. We substituted a serine for the cysteine and transiently expressed γ2C68S in HEK293 cells in conjunction with wild type औ1 in the presence and absence of wild type αs. In immunofluorescent staining, little औ1γ2C68S was found at the PM regardless of αs expression (Fig.2A). To test whether poor PM localization of औ1γ2C68S, when expressed with αs, resulted from an inability to form a heterotrimer, the औ1γ2 dimer was pulled down with Ni-NTA beads, taking advantage of an N-terminal hexahistidine tag on औ1, and immunoblotted for the αssubunit. औ1γ2 was able to efficiently pull down αs (Fig. 2B, lane 3). Similarly, the औ1γ2C68S dimer pulled down the αs subunit (Fig. 2B, lane 6), implying that αs and औ1γ2C68S are capable of assembling a heterotrimer. In this assay, efficient heterotrimer formation required co-expression of all three components. When lysates from cells expressing औ1γ2 or औ1γ2C68S were mixed with a lysate from cells expressing only αs, heterotrimer formation was not detected (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 7). The results with γ2C68S indicate that non-prenylated γ2 can form a complex with wild type αs and औ1, but the औ1γ2C68S dimer was not localized at the PM. To determine whether औ1γ2 displayed very poor PM targeting without the co-expressed αs because of inefficient lipid modification of the γ2 subunit, a prenylation assay was carried out. Because HEK293 cells, in our hands, detached from the bottom of culture plates upon treatment with mevastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, the experiments were carried out using COS7 cells. Similar to its subcellular localization in HEK293 cells, औ1γ2 is poorly targeted to the PM in COS7 cells unless an α subunit is also co-expressed (13Michaelson D. Ahearn I. Bergo M. Young S. Philips M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3294-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The औ1 and γ2 subunits were transiently transfected into COS7 cells in the absence or presence of the αs subunit. The transfected cells were labeled with [3H]mevalolactone in the presence of mevastatin for 18 h. The औ1γ2 complexes were isolated using Ni-NTA beads. Because the औ1 subunit contains the N-terminal hexahistidine tag, only γ2 subunits that are bound to औ1 are pulled down in these experiments. The level of isoprenoid incorporated into γ2 was visualized by fluorography and that of expression of γ2 was assessed by Western blotting. Mock/pcDNA3 transfection showed no nonspecific uptake of the radioactivity (Fig. 2C, lane 1), and as expected, γ2C68S failed to incorporate radioactivity (Fig. 2C, lane 4). The औ1γ2 efficiently incorporated radioactive isoprenoid in the presence of the αs subunit, and virtually no difference was seen in incorporation of radioactivity into the औ1γ2 without the αssubunit (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 3). Therefore, the defect in the PM localization of औ1γ2 when expressed in the absence of α was not due to failure of the γ2 subunit to be prenylated. In other words, the औ1γ2 dimer is capable of being modified with the isoprenoid group in the absence of the α subunit. It is therefore conceivable that lipid modification takes place prior to trimer formation. Without co-expressed αs, the औ1γ2 complex is prenylated but localized to the PM very poorly. Next we examined the subcellular localization of the prenylated औ1γ2 by a cell fractionation assay. After transient transfection, cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer, and the soluble and particulate fractions, representing cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, were separated by ultracentrifugation. Proteins in each fraction were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody to detect the औ1 subunit of the औ1γ2 dimer. With co-expressed αs, virtually all औ1γ2 complexes were found in the particulate fraction (Fig.3A, lane 2), presumably tethered to the PM (Fig. 1d). When expressed alone, the औ1γ2 dimers, which localized very poorly at the PM (Fig. 1, a and b), were also found mostly in the particulate fraction (Fig.3A, lane 4). This suggests that the prenylated औ1γ2 was targeted to membranes other than the PM. To examine the intracellular localization of औ1γ2 more closely, we compared the subcellular localization of औ1γ2 with an ER marker protein using confocal microscopy. औ1γ2, when expressed alone, exhibited a subcellular distribution virtually identical to the ER marker (Fig.3B, a and b), whereas औ1γ2, when expressed with αs, displayed PM localization that was clearly distinct from the ER (Fig.3B, c and d). These results are thus consistent with a model in which the औ1γ2dimer is geranylgeranylated in the cytosol by a cytoplasmic geranylgeranyltransferase (14Higgins J.B. Casey P.J. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and then targeted to ER, prior to α-dependent transit to the PM."

We produced synuclein with incorporated photoprobes to identify and purify novel synuclein-interacting proteins both to begin to clarify the physiology of synuclein and to identify factors that may regulate synuclein conformation. We detected several cross-links and purified and identified one as calmodulin (CaM). CaM binds to both wild type and PD-associated mutant α-synucleins in a calcium-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that CaM and α-synuclein interact in intact cells in a calcium-dependent manner and that activated CaM accelerates the formation of synuclein fibrils in vitro. We hypothesize that the known calcium control of synuclein function is mediated through CaM interaction and that CaM potentially alters synuclein conformation. α-Synuclein is a neuronal protein thought to be central in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) because it comprises the fibrillar core of Lewy bodies, one of the histologically defining lesions of PD, and because mutations in α-synuclein cause autosomal dominant PD.

Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar) results in formation of synuclein-containing inclusions that in many respects resemble Lewy bodies, in alterations of dopamine neurons, and in movement-related phenotypes. Deletion of the α-synuclein gene in mice does not result in a phenotype resembling PD. Instead, dopaminergic neurons prepared from α-synuclein-deficient mice display altered dopamine release in one experimental paradigm of synaptic plasticity (31Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.H. Castillo P.E. Shinsky N. Verdugo J.M. Armanini M. Ryan A. Hynes M. Phillips H. Sulzer D. Rosenthal A.

It therefore appears more likely that the synuclein mutations are associated with a gain of a toxic function, and it is not exclusively the loss of synuclein function that causes PD in the affected patients. One effect of PD mutations may be to increase the propensity to form fibrils, again suggesting that synuclein conformations are related to PD.The most striking feature of the primary amino acid sequence of α-synuclein is the repetition 8 times of an 11-amino acid motif that is predicted to form amphipathic α-helices (7George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Contrary to the predictions, recombinant or purified α-synuclein is considered “natively unfolded” and has little identifiable periodic secondary structure as assessed by circular dichroism (32Weinreb P.H.

However, when incubated with small unilamellar liposomes of certain lipid (mimicking those found in synaptic vesicles), SDS micelles, or certain helix-forming solvents, the protein undergoes a conformational change, becoming largely helical, and associates with the liposomes (33Jo E.

At this point, it is not clear which subcellular membranes α-synuclein may associate with.Although purified α-synuclein initially has little in the way of periodic secondary structure, in vitro studies with purified or recombinant synuclein have demonstrated that synuclein can spontaneously form fibrils having a high degree of antiparallel औ-pleated sheet structure (16Hashimoto M.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).Given the apparent paradox that pure synuclein spontaneously forms fibrils or, in the presence of certain lipid membranes, becomes largely helical and binds to membranes but that in cells most synuclein appears to be natively unfolded and not membrane bound, we hypothesize that synuclein conformation and/or membrane association may be regulated by synuclein-binding proteins.Several proteins have been proposed to be synuclein interactors (41Lee F.J. Liu F. Pristupa Z.B. Niznik H.B. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 916-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar,42Ostrerova N. Petrucelli L. Farrer M. Mehta N. Choi P. Hardy J. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In transfection experiments, synphillin (43Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), an α-synuclein interactor identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen, promoted formation of NAC (a peptide derived from synuclein) aggregates. Also, by interacting with α-synuclein, औ-synuclein may inhibit the ability of α-synuclein to form fibrils (44Hashimoto M. Rockenstein E. Mante M. Mallory M. Masliah E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar).Although much work has begun to elucidate the mechanism by which purified α-synuclein forms fibrils and of some stimuli that may trigger aggregation of α-synuclein, relatively little is understood about how or whether α-synuclein interactors alter fibril formation.We employed a photocross-linking strategy (45Gorlich D. Kurzchalia T.V. Wiedmann M. Rapoport T.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to detect proteins in brain extracts present at endogenous levels and in direct contact with α-synuclein. We purified and identified one such protein as calmodulin (CaM). We show that CaM and α-synuclein interact in a calcium-dependent manner both in vitro andin vivo and that activated CaM accelerates the kinetics of synuclein fibrilization.DISCUSSIONWe utilized a photocross-linking strategy to identify potential α-synuclein-binding proteins that may have eluded identification by other methodologies. We show that several brain cytosolic proteins are in contact with synuclein and identified CaM as an α-synuclein-binding protein. We employed a photocross-linking technique heretofore not utilized in investigating neurodegenerative diseases. With this technology, cross-links are detected only if the two proteins are contacting one another during the instant the cross-linker is active. An additional advantage is that biochemical environment can be altered to assess what effect such alterations have on the interaction under investigation. Furthermore, any interactions detected are occurring in extracts made from tissues expressing endogenous levels of all proteins in question. We show that the interaction between synuclein and CaM is calcium-dependent and is unaffected by Parkinson's disease-related mutations in synuclein. Also, the interaction could be revealed in intact cells expressing endogenous levels of both CaM and α-synuclein in a calcium-dependent manner and could be blocked with a CaM inhibitor.Whereas one recent report has identified a low affinity calcium binding domain in synuclein (58Nielsen M.S. Vorum H. Lindersson E. Jensen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22680-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), this region, comprising the last ∼30 residues of α-synuclein, is probably dispensable in our assay, since our His-tagged version of synuclein, which binds CaM, lacks the C-terminal 20 residues. Furthermore, there are no lysine residues in this region to give rise to the cross-links (see Fig. 1). Although some metal ions can alter synuclein secondary structure and propensity to aggregate, the Lansbury laboratory (32Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar) has published that low millimolar concentrations (10 mm) of calcium ions do not directly alter synuclein secondary structure as assessed by CD spectroscopy. We have demonstrated that CaM and synuclein interact directly in a calcium-dependent manner. The apparent affinity constant of CaM for synuclein is ∼20 nm. CaM and synuclein are abundant enough to make this a physiologically relevant interaction. Intracellular CaM concentrations have been estimated to be 1–10 mm, and CaM is estimated to be 0.1–17 of total protein in neurons (59Gnegy M.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 45-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the BBC protein concentration is 4 mg/ml (which is significantly diluted compared with intracellular cytosol concentrations), the CaM concentration is likely to be 0.004–0.04 mg/ml, which corresponds to at least 0.24–2.4 mm. Therefore, CaM concentrations are high enough to allow for physiologically relevant interactions with α-synuclein.Intriguingly, α-synuclein alters stimulation-dependent dopamine release, and calcium levels modulate this function of synuclein (31Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.H. Castillo P.E. Shinsky N. Verdugo J.M. Armanini M. Ryan A. Hynes M. Phillips H. Sulzer D. Rosenthal A. Neuron. 2000; 25: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Because synuclein is regulated by calcium and we independently purified CaM as a cross-linking partner of synuclein, we hypothesize that CaM may mediate the effect of calcium on the previously observed ability of synuclein to alter dopamine release.Synucleins are also substrates for GRK 5, a G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (9Pronin A.N. Morris A.J. Surguchov A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26515-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). This kinase, which is involved in ligand-dependent receptor desensitization, is inhibited by CaM. Whereas CaM inhibits GRK5 autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of other substrates in the absence of synuclein, CaM actually stimulates kinase autophosphorylation and synuclein phosphorylation in the presence of synuclein. Thus, synuclein may act as a switch to convert CaM from an inhibitor to an activator of GRK.The fact that we observed several species that were both CaM- and synuclein-immunoreactive (Fig. 7) only with calcium and not when the CaM inhibitor was used, indicates that CaM and synuclein may form higher order complexes in the presence of Ca2+. It is tempting to speculate that Ca2+/CaM drives assembly of synuclein-containing multimeric complexes or perhaps regulates the oligomerization status of synuclein. There is precedence for CaM driving oligomeric assembly of subunits of small conductance K+ channels (60Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Our in vitro fibril formation data is at least consistent with this idea. Further work will be directed toward elucidating the mechanism by which CaM alters synuclein's ability to change conformation. Although many neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by specific patterns of neuronal loss, distinct clinical presentations, and unique histopathological features, many of the diseases including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, trinucleotide repeat diseases, and spongiform encephalopathies display proteinaceous aggregates, inclusions, or plaques as characteristic or defining features upon pathologic examination of involved tissue (1Martin J.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1970-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These plaques or inclusions are composed of neuronal proteins or fragments thereof, which have adopted altered conformations that have resulted in the formation of fibrillar amyloid plaques or inclusions having a high degree of औ-pleated sheet secondary structure. Parkinson's disease (PD)1 is the second most common neurodegenerative disease with a prevalence of about 27 of those 65 years of age and older.

Taken together, these findings suggest that altered synuclein conformation is linked to neurodegeneration. Overexpression of human α-synuclein as a transgene in mice (28Masliah E. Rockenstein E.

Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar) results in formation of synuclein-containing inclusions that in many respects resemble Lewy bodies, in alterations of dopamine neurons, and in movement-related phenotypes. Deletion of the α-synuclein gene in mice does not result in a phenotype resembling PD. Instead, dopaminergic neurons prepared from α-synuclein-deficient mice display altered dopamine release in one experimental paradigm of synaptic plasticity (31Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.H. Castillo P.E. Shinsky N. Verdugo J.M. Armanini M. Ryan A. Hynes M. Phillips H. Sulzer D. Rosenthal A. Neuron. 2000; 25: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). It therefore appears more likely that the synuclein mutations are associated with a gain of a toxic function, and it is not exclusively the loss of synuclein function that causes PD in the affected patients. One effect of PD mutations may be to increase the propensity to form fibrils, again suggesting that synuclein conformations are related to PD. The most striking feature of the primary amino acid sequence of α-synuclein is the repetition 8 times of an 11-amino acid motif that is predicted to form amphipathic α-helices (7George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Contrary to the predictions, recombinant or purified α-synuclein is considered “natively unfolded” and has little identifiable periodic secondary structure as assessed by circular dichroism (32Weinreb P.H.

However, when incubated with small unilamellar liposomes of certain lipid (mimicking those found in synaptic vesicles), SDS micelles, or certain helix-forming solvents, the protein undergoes a conformational change, becoming largely helical, and associates with the liposomes (33Jo E.

An NMR study showed that it is indeed the N-terminal portion of the protein that can become helical and membrane-associated (34Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol.

At this point, it is not clear which subcellular membranes α-synuclein may associate with. Although purified α-synuclein initially has little in the way of periodic secondary structure, in vitro studies with purified or recombinant synuclein have demonstrated that synuclein can spontaneously form fibrils having a high degree of antiparallel औ-pleated sheet structure (16Hashimoto M.

Given the apparent paradox that pure synuclein spontaneously forms fibrils or, in the presence of certain lipid membranes, becomes largely helical and binds to membranes but that in cells most synuclein appears to be natively unfolded and not membrane bound, we hypothesize that synuclein conformation and/or membrane association may be regulated by synuclein-binding proteins. Several proteins have been proposed to be synuclein interactors (41Lee F.J. Liu F. Pristupa Z.B. Niznik H.B. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 916-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar,42Ostrerova N. Petrucelli L. Farrer M. Mehta N. Choi P. Hardy J. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In transfection experiments, synphillin (43Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), an α-synuclein interactor identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen, promoted formation of NAC (a peptide derived from synuclein) aggregates. Also, by interacting with α-synuclein, औ-synuclein may inhibit the ability of α-synuclein to form fibrils (44Hashimoto M. Rockenstein E. Mante M. Mallory M. Masliah E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Although much work has begun to elucidate the mechanism by which purified α-synuclein forms fibrils and of some stimuli that may trigger aggregation of α-synuclein, relatively little is understood about how or whether α-synuclein interactors alter fibril formation. We employed a photocross-linking strategy (45Gorlich D. Kurzchalia T.V. Wiedmann M. Rapoport T.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to detect proteins in brain extracts present at endogenous levels and in direct contact with α-synuclein. We purified and identified one such protein as calmodulin (CaM). We show that CaM and α-synuclein interact in a calcium-dependent manner both in vitro andin vivo and that activated CaM accelerates the kinetics of synuclein fibrilization. DISCUSSIONWe utilized a photocross-linking strategy to identify potential α-synuclein-binding proteins that may have eluded identification by other methodologies. We show that several brain cytosolic proteins are in contact with synuclein and identified CaM as an α-synuclein-binding protein. We employed a photocross-linking technique heretofore not utilized in investigating neurodegenerative diseases. With this technology, cross-links are detected only if the two proteins are contacting one another during the instant the cross-linker is active. An additional advantage is that biochemical environment can be altered to assess what effect such alterations have on the interaction under investigation. Furthermore, any interactions detected are occurring in extracts made from tissues expressing endogenous levels of all proteins in question. We show that the interaction between synuclein and CaM is calcium-dependent and is unaffected by Parkinson's disease-related mutations in synuclein. Also, the interaction could be revealed in intact cells expressing endogenous levels of both CaM and α-synuclein in a calcium-dependent manner and could be blocked with a CaM inhibitor.Whereas one recent report has identified a low affinity calcium binding domain in synuclein (58Nielsen M.S. Vorum H. Lindersson E. Jensen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22680-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), this region, comprising the last ∼30 residues of α-synuclein, is probably dispensable in our assay, since our His-tagged version of synuclein, which binds CaM, lacks the C-terminal 20 residues. Furthermore, there are no lysine residues in this region to give rise to the cross-links (see Fig. 1). Although some metal ions can alter synuclein secondary structure and propensity to aggregate, the Lansbury laboratory (32Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar) has published that low millimolar concentrations (10 mm) of calcium ions do not directly alter synuclein secondary structure as assessed by CD spectroscopy. We have demonstrated that CaM and synuclein interact directly in a calcium-dependent manner. The apparent affinity constant of CaM for synuclein is ∼20 nm. CaM and synuclein are abundant enough to make this a physiologically relevant interaction. Intracellular CaM concentrations have been estimated to be 1–10 mm, and CaM is estimated to be 0.1–17 of total protein in neurons (59Gnegy M.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 45-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the BBC protein concentration is 4 mg/ml (which is significantly diluted compared with intracellular cytosol concentrations), the CaM concentration is likely to be 0.004–0.04 mg/ml, which corresponds to at least 0.24–2.4 mm. Therefore, CaM concentrations are high enough to allow for physiologically relevant interactions with α-synuclein.Intriguingly, α-synuclein alters stimulation-dependent dopamine release, and calcium levels modulate this function of synuclein (31Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.H. Castillo P.E. Shinsky N. Verdugo J.M. Armanini M. Ryan A. Hynes M. Phillips H. Sulzer D. Rosenthal A. Neuron. 2000; 25: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Because synuclein is regulated by calcium and we independently purified CaM as a cross-linking partner of synuclein, we hypothesize that CaM may mediate the effect of calcium on the previously observed ability of synuclein to alter dopamine release.Synucleins are also substrates for GRK 5, a G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (9Pronin A.N. Morris A.J. Surguchov A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26515-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). This kinase, which is involved in ligand-dependent receptor desensitization, is inhibited by CaM. Whereas CaM inhibits GRK5 autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of other substrates in the absence of synuclein, CaM actually stimulates kinase autophosphorylation and synuclein phosphorylation in the presence of synuclein. Thus, synuclein may act as a switch to convert CaM from an inhibitor to an activator of GRK.The fact that we observed several species that were both CaM- and synuclein-immunoreactive (Fig. 7) only with calcium and not when the CaM inhibitor was used, indicates that CaM and synuclein may form higher order complexes in the presence of Ca2+. It is tempting to speculate that Ca2+/CaM drives assembly of synuclein-containing multimeric complexes or perhaps regulates the oligomerization status of synuclein. There is precedence for CaM driving oligomeric assembly of subunits of small conductance K+ channels (60Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Our in vitro fibril formation data is at least consistent with this idea.

https://openalex.org/W2091153250,"We previously demonstrated that the endogenously expressed human intermediate conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ channel (hIK1) was inhibited by arachidonic acid (AA) (Devor, D. C., and Frizzell, R. A. (1998) Am. J. Physiol. 274, C138–C148). Here we demonstrate, using the excised, inside-out patch-clamp technique, that hIK1, heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells, is inhibited 82 ± 27 (n = 16) with 3 ॖm AA, being half-maximally inhibited (IC50) at 1.4 ± 0.7 ॖm. In contrast, AA does not inhibit the Ca2+-dependent, small conductance K+ channel, rSK2, another member of the KCNNgene family. Therefore, we utilized chimeric hIK1/rSK2 channels to define the AA binding domain on hIK1 to the S5-Pore-S6 region of the channel. Subsequent site-directed mutagenesis revealed that mutation of Thr250 to Ser (T250S) resulted in a channel with limited sensitivity to block by AA (8 ± 27, n = 8), demonstrating that Thr250 is a key molecular determinant for the inhibition of hIK1 by AA. Likewise, when Val275 in S6 was mutated to Ala (V275A) AA inhibited only 43 ± 117 (n = 9) of current flow. The double mutation T250S/V275A eliminated the AA sensitivity of hIK1. Introducing the complimentary single amino acid substitutions into rSK2 (S359T and A384V) conferred partial AA sensitivity to rSK2, 21 ± 37 and 31 ± 37, respectively. Further, introducing the double mutation S359T/A384V into rSK2 resulted in a 63 ± 87 (n= 9) inhibition by AA, thereby demonstrating the ability to introduce this inhibitory AA binding site into another member of theKCNN gene family. These results demonstrate that AA interacts with the pore-lining amino acids, Thr250 and Val275 in hIK1, conferring inhibition of hIK1 by AA and that AA and clotrimazole share similar, if not identical, molecular sites of interaction. We previously demonstrated that the endogenously expressed human intermediate conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ channel (hIK1) was inhibited by arachidonic acid (AA) (Devor, D. C., and Frizzell, R. A.

Further, introducing the double mutation S359T/A384V into rSK2 resulted in a 63 ± 87 (n= 9) inhibition by AA, thereby demonstrating the ability to introduce this inhibitory AA binding site into another member of theKCNN gene family. These results demonstrate that AA interacts with the pore-lining amino acids, Thr250 and Val275 in hIK1, conferring inhibition of hIK1 by AA and that AA and clotrimazole share similar, if not identical, molecular sites of interaction. arachidonic acid human embryonic kidney 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic cyclo-oxygenase lipoxygenase Intermediate conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ channels play crucial roles in a wide array of physiological processes, including agonist-mediated transepithelial Cl− secretion across airway and intestinal epithelia (1Dharmsathaphorn K.

Invest. 1986; 77: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) initially proposed that Ca2+-mediated intestinal Cl− secretion was dependent upon the activation of a basolateral membrane K+conductance in the absence of a change in apical membrane Cl− conductance. As a consequence of the increased K+ conductance there would be a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, thereby increasing the electrochemical driving force for Cl− exit across the apical membrane via constitutively active Cl− channels (7Dharmsathaphorn K. Pandol S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 8Hamilton K.L. Meads L. Butt A.G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 439: 158-166PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in intracellular Ca2+ alone can stimulate Cl−secretion across the colonic epithelial cell line, T84 (5Kachintorn U. Vajanaphanich M. Traynorkaplan A.E. Dharmsathaphorn K. Barrett K.E. Br.

Yet, there is a disparity between the magnitude and time course of the rise in intracellular Ca2+ and the subsequent Cl−secretory response (1Dharmsathaphorn K. Cohn J. Beuerlein G. Am. J.

Physiol. 1991; 261: G220-G228PubMed Google Scholar) such that the Cl− secretory response is transient in nature. These data suggest that second messengers other than Ca2+ may down-regulate the secretory response. Various inhibitory second messengers have been proposed, including protein kinase C (5Kachintorn U.

It is proposed that these second messengers may inhibit the K+conductance, thus modulating the Cl− secretory response even in the presence of elevated intracellular Ca2+levels. Ca2+-mediated agonists are known to increase AA levels in a wide range of tissues where hIK1 is expressed, including colon and lung (14Barrett K.E. Cell Signal. 1995; 7: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 16Barrett K.E. Bigby T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C446-C452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17DeRubertis F.R. Craven P.A.

This can occur in several ways (19Abdel-Latif A.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1986; 38: 227-272PubMed Google Scholar), including: 1) Ca2+ directly activating PLA2, 2) either diacylglycerol itself or protein kinase C activating PLA2, or 3) diacylglycerol lipase directly generating AA from diacylglycerol. Thus, the generation of AA by Ca2+-mediated agonists would be expected to lag behind the rise in intracellular Ca2+. Given this, an effect of AA on hIK1 would be temporally appropriate to explain the dissociation between changes in intracellular Ca2+ and the resultant Cl− secretory response. Likewise, AA is released during inflammatory responses such as asthma (20Calabrese C. Triggiani M. Marone G. Mazzarella G. Allergy. 2000; 55: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and irritable bowel disease (21Pacheco S. Hillier K. Smith C. Clin. Sci. 1987; 73: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) such that AA may play an important role in modulating ion channels in these diseases. Arachidonic acid has been shown to modulate a wide variety of ion channels, including K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Cl− channels (22Meves H. Prog. Neurobiol. 1994; 43: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 23Ordway R.W. Singer J.J. Walsh Jr., J.V.

Indeed, we previously demonstrated that inhibition of cytosolic PLA2 resulted in a potentiated Cl− secretory response to the Ca2+-mediated agonist, carbachol in T84 cells and that AA was a potent negative modulator of the intermediate conductance, Ca2+-dependent K+ channel in these cells (2Devor D.C. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C138-C148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we (26Gerlach A.C. Gangopadhyay N.N. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 585-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and others (3Warth R. Hamm K. Bleich M. Kunzelmann K. von Hahn T. Schreiber R. Ullrich E. Mengel M.

In the present study, we demonstrate that AA directly inhibits heterologously expressed hIK1, whereas rSK2 is insensitive to AA. Using a series of hIK1/rSK2 chimeras and point mutations we demonstrate that AA inhibits hIK1 via an interaction with two pore-lining amino acids, Thr250 and Val275. Importantly, substitution of these amino acids into rSK2 induces sensitivity to AA, confirming the critical nature of these amino acids in defining the molecular binding site for AA on hIK1. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum and 17 penicillin-streptomycin in a humidified 57 CO2/957 O2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Stable cell lines were generated for all constructs by subjecting cells to antibiotic selection (1 mg/ml G418) 48 h post-transfection. Selection was typically complete within 14 days post-transfection. Following selection, the concentration of G418 was reduced to 0.2 mg/ml. We and others have previously demonstrated that hIK1, heterologously expressed in HEK cells, has identical biophysical, pharmacological, and second messenger-dependent regulatory properties to the endogenously expressed channel (26Gerlach A.C. Gangopadhyay N.N. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 585-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 29Singh S. Syme C.A. Singh A.K. Devor D.C. Bridges R.J. J. Pharmacol.

P. Adelman (Vollum Institute, Oregon Health Sciences University). hIK1 and rSK2 were subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) using the EcoRI andXhoI restriction sites. The schematic structures of hIK1 and rSK2 are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively.Figure 2Effect of arachidonic acid on rSK2.A, schematic of rSK2. B, representative current (pA) trace of the effect of arachidonic acid (3 ॖm) on rSK2. rSK2 was heterologously expressed in HEK cells and recorded in excised, inside-out patches at a holding potential of −100 mV. 0 Ca2+ steps occurred at the beginning and the end of the experiment to illustrate the Ca2+ dependence of rSK2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chimera generation and site-directed mutagenesis were performed as described by Gerlach et al. (31Gerlach A.C. Syme C.A. Giltinan L. Adelman J.P. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10963-10970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, chimeras between hIK1 (427 amino acids) and rSK2 (580 amino acids) were generated by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction using Pfxpolymerase (Invitrogen). The chimeras 26IK-SK, 200IK-SK, SK-200IK, and SK-287IK were generated (see Fig. 3 for schematic representations of these chimeric constructs). The chimeras were subcloned into the pcDNA 3.1+ vector using EcoR1 andXhoI restriction sites. Point mutations were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis strategy using Pfupolymerase (Invitrogen). The fidelity of all constructs utilized in this study were confirmed by sequencing (ABI PRISM 377 automated sequencer, University of Pittsburgh) and subsequent sequence alignment (NCBI BLAST 2.0) with hIK1 (GenBankTM accession number AF022150) and rSK2 (GenBankTM accession numberU69882). Stable cell lines of each of these constructs were established in HEK293 cells as described above. The effects of AA on hIK1, rSK2, chimeric, and point-mutation channels were assessed with excised, inside-out patch-clamp experiments as a functional assay. Currents were recorded using a List EPC-7 amplifier (Medical Systems, Greenvale, NY) and stored on videotape for later analysis. Electrodes were fabricated from thin-walled borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), pulled on a vertical puller (Narishige, Long Island, NY), fire-polished, and had a resistance of 1–4 MΩ. During patch-clamp experiments, the bath solution was (in mm) potassium gluconate 145, KCl 5, MgCl2 2, HEPES 10, CaCl2 10 ॖm, pH 7.2 (adjusted with KOH). To obtain a 0 Ca2+ bath solution EGTA (1 mm) was added without CaCl2 (estimated free Ca2+ <10 nm). All bath solutions contained 100 ॖm 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone to maximally activate channels and 300 ॖm ATP to prevent channel rundown (31Gerlach A.C. Syme C.A. Giltinan L. Adelman J.P. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10963-10970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The pipette solution was (in mm) potassium gluconate 140, KCl 5, MgCl2 1, HEPES 10, CaCl2 1, pH 7.2 (adjusted with KOH). All chimeras tested were strictly Ca2+-sensitive as a Ca2+-free bath solution eliminated all channel activity. Generally, a 3-ॖmconcentration of AA was used (except for the concentration-response experiments). Constructs that were not sensitive to block by AA were always tested in parallel with hIK1 or a chimera known to be sensitive to AA as a positive control. All experiments were performed at room temperature. All patches were held at a holding potential of −100 mV. The voltage is referenced to the extracellular compartment, as is the standard method for membrane potentials. Inward currents are defined as the movement of positive charge from the extracellular compartment to the intracellular compartment and are presented as downward deflections from the baseline in all recordings. Channel data were digitized with the Fetchex application within the pCLAMP suite of programs (version 6.04, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) using a PC computer. Single channel analysis was performed on records after low pass filtering at 200 Hz and sampling at 500 Hz (Digidata 1200, Axon Instruments). Total channel current was determined using Biopatch software (version 3.3, Bio-Logic). 1-Ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone, AA, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic (ETYA), clotrimazole, and all general chemicals were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. ATP was purchased from Roche Applied Science and added directly to a Ringer's solution as a dry powder. 1-Ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone, AA, and clotrimazole were made as 10,000-fold stock solutions in Me2SO. All data are presented as means ± S.E., where n indicates the number of experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student's t test (paired or unpaired) or analysis of variance with Student-Newman-Keuls multiple posttest. A value of p < 0.05 is considered statistically significant and is reported. We previously demonstrated that AA inhibits endogenously expressed hIK1 in T84 cells with high affinity (2Devor D.C. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C138-C148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we initially characterized the AA sensitivity of heterologously expressed hIK1 (Fig. 1A) in HEK293 cells in excised, inside-out patches. As shown in a representative experiment in Fig. 1B, following the establishment of a stable current, the addition of AA (3 ॖm) induced a significant reduction in current. The average current prior to AA was 468 ± 60 pA, which was reduced by 82 ± 27 to 81 ± 18 pA in the presence of AA (p < 0.001, n = 16). Arachidonic acid inhibited hIK1 in a concentration-dependent manner, being half-maximal (IC50) at 1.4 ± 0.7 ॖm (n = 5, Fig. 1C), a value similar to what we previously reported for endogenously expressed hIK1 (IC50 = 0.42 ॖm) in T84 cells (2Devor D.C. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C138-C148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid can elicit its effect by interacting directly with ion channels or indirectly by metabolites produced via cyclo-oxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and/or cytochrome P450 pathways (22Meves H. Prog. Neurobiol. 1994; 43: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 23Ordway R.W. Singer J.J. Walsh Jr., J.V. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that inhibitors of COX, LOX, and cytochrome P-450 did not affect the AA-dependent inhibition of endogenously expressed hIK1 in T84 cells (2Devor D.C. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C138-C148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed these results in the present study by examining the effects of AA in the presence of ETYA (10 ॖm), a blocker of COX, LOX, and P450 pathways (32Holmqvist M.H. Cao J. Knoppers M.H. Jurman M.E. Distefano P.S. Rhodes K.J. Xie Y. An W.F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4154-4161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Liu Y. Liu D. Heath L. Meyers D.M. Krafte D.S. Wagoner P.K. Silvia C.P., Yu, W. Curran M.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using excised, inside-out patches. As shown in Fig.1D, ETYA had no effect on hIK1 current. Under control conditions channel current was 622 ± 83 pA, and ETYA did not significantly reduce this current (560 ± 94 pA). However, subsequent addition of AA (3 ॖm) reduced channel current by 777 (117 ± 26 pA, p < 0.01,n = 3) in the continued presence of ETYA. These data suggest that oxidative metabolites of AA are not involved in the inhibition of hIK1 observed. Since hIK1 shares ∼407 sequence homology with rSK2 (27Ishii T.M. Silvia C. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11651-11656Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 28Joiner W.J. Wang L.Y. Tang M.D. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11013-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) we examined whether rSK2 could be inhibited by AA in excised, inside-out patches. A representative experiment is shown in Fig.2B in which AA did not reduce channel current in HEK cells heterologously expressing rSK2. The average channel current was 491 ± 169 pA in the absence of AA and 438 ± 136 pA in the presence of AA (n = 4), representing an 8 ± 37 inhibition of current flow. The Ca2+ dependence of rSK2 was subsequently verified by demonstrating that our 0 Ca2+ solution reduced channel current to zero (Fig. 2B). These data demonstrate that even though hIK1 and rSK2 share ∼407 sequence homology AA sensitivity is specific to hIK1. Based on our observation that AA inhibits hIK1, while having no effect on rSK2, we used a chimeric hIK1/rSK2 strategy to identify the region of the channel that confers AA sensitivity to hIK1. Wang and co-workers (34Macica C.M. Yang Y. Lerea K. Hebert S.C. Wang W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F175-F181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the NH2 terminus (particularly Ser4) of ROMK1 plays a key role in the determination of the AA effect on that channel. hIK1 has a serine (Ser24) just prior to S1. Thus, we initially generated the chimera 26IK-SK (Met1–Ala26 of hIK1 with Asp137–Ser508 of rSK2; schematic diagram in Fig. 3A) in which only the cytoplasmic NH2 terminus is derived from hIK1. As shown for one experiment in Fig. 3A (right panel), after a sustained current was established, AA had little effect (7 ± 37 inhibition, Fig. 3E) on this construct; however, 0 bath Ca2+ eliminated channel current. In five experiments, the channel current prior to the addition of AA was 296 ± 16 pA and 277 ± 17 pA in the presence of AA. The absence of inhibition of the 26IK-SK channel suggests that the cytoplasmic NH2terminus of hIK1 is insufficient to confer AA sensitivity to rSK2. Kim et al. (35Kim Y. Gnatenco C. Bang H. Kim D. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 442: 952-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) reported that the COOH terminus is important in the AA sensitivity of TREK-2, a two-pore, four-transmembrane domain K+ channel. To elucidate the role of the COOH terminus in the AA sensitivity of hIK1, we generated the chimeric channel SK-287IK (Met1–Ala395 of rSK2 with Arg287–Lys427 of hIK1; see Fig. 3Bfor schematic) in which only the cytoplasmic COOH terminus is derived from hIK1. As shown in Fig. 3B (right panel), AA did not alter the channel current of the SK-287IK channel. In six excised, inside-out patch-clamp experiments, the average current was 467 ± 169 pA in the absence of AA and 472 ± 176 pA in the presence of AA. The failure of AA to reduce the activity of the SK-287IK channel suggests that the cytoplasmic COOH terminus of hIK1 is not sufficient to confer AA sensitivity to rSK2. To determine whether the S1-S4 or pore region of hIK1 was important in the AA sensitivity, we generated two additional channel constructs that alternated the first half of hIK1 and rSK2. The first construct, 200IK-SK (Met1–Met200 of hIK1 with Thr207–Ser508 of rSK2; see Fig. 3Cfor schematic) is composed of the entire NH2 terminus to the beginning of S5 of hIK1, while the remainder of the channel construct is derived from rSK2. As shown for one representative experiment in Fig. 3C (right panel), AA only modestly reduced current flow through 200IK-SK. AA inhibited the channel current of 200IK-SK by an average of only 5 ± 57, from 239 ± 33 pA to 228 ± 37 pA (n = 8, Fig.3E). The second channel construct was SK-200IK (Met1–Leu306 of rSK2 with Met200–Lys427 of hIK1; see Fig. 3Dfor schematic) in which the NH2 terminus through the beginning of S5 is from rSK2, whereas S5-pore-S6 and the COOH terminus is derived from hIK1. As shown by one representative trace in Fig.3D (right panel), AA significantly reduced the channel current of SK-200IK. In four experiments the average current of SK-200IK was reduced an average of 70 ± 57 (p < 0.05, Fig. 3E) from 430 ± 109 pA in the absence of AA to 127 ± 34 pA in the presence of AA. In light of the data for the SK-287IK channel construct (Fig. 3B), which demonstrated that the COOH terminus was not crucial for the AA inhibition of hIK1, the experimental results of the SK-200IK channel construct confirm that the AA sensitivity of hIK1 lies within the S5-pore-S6 region of hIK1. To identify the specific amino acid residue(s) responsible for the inhibition of hIK1 by AA, we made selected amino acid mutations in hIK1 with their rSK2 amino acid counterparts. The amino acid alignment of the S5 linker-pore region is shown in Fig.4. The amino acids that are different between hIK1 and rSK2 are shown in bold type. Initially, three multiple amino acid mutations of hIK1 were generated. These mutations are shown in Fig. 4 (underlined) and include: GHL (G235S/H236N/L237F), SDTL (S238L/D239G/T240A/L241M), and VGMW (V256M/G259N/M261Y/W262C). Fig. 5illustrates representative current traces for GHL/SNF (5A), SDTL/LGAM (5B) and VGMW/MNYC (5C). For each of these channels, AA significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited current flow (GHL/SNF, 623 ± 199pA to 133 ± 49 pA, n = 5, Fig, 5A; SDTL/LGAM 494 ± 115 pA to 83 ± 19 pA,n = 6, Fig. 5B; VGMW/MNYC 246 ± 85 pA to 53 ± 19 pA, n = 5, Fig. 5C). These data are summarized in the bar graph shown in Fig. 5F and suggest that these amino acids are not important in conferring the AA sensitivity of hIK1.Figure 5Effect of AA on the channel current of mutated hIK1-Thr250 and -Val275 confer AAsensitivity.

F, percentage inhibition summary data for all experiments for the mutated channels are given (number of experiments shown above thebars). Data for hIK1 are also presented for comparison. Mutated hIK1 channels were heterologously expressed in HEK cells and recorded in excised, inside-out patches at a holding potential of −100 mV. 0 Ca2+ steps occurred at the end of the experiments for the T250S and V275A constructs to illustrate the Ca2+dependence of these channels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next mutated the threonine (Thr250) just prior to the K+ selectivity filter GYG (Gly-Tyr-Gly) motif of hIK1 to serine (T250S-hIK1), which is present in rSK2 (see Fig. 4). A representative excised patch-clamp experiment of this construct is shown in Fig. 5D. The T250S-hIK1 channel possessed significantly reduced (p< 0.05) AA sensitivity compared with hIK1 (Fig. 1B). Arachidonic acid reduced the channel current of this construct by only 8 ± 27 from 304 ± 59 pA to 280 ± 62 pA (Fig.5F, n = 8). The effect of AA on the T250S-hIK1 channel was not different than that for rSK2 (8 ± 37 inhibition, Fig. 2). These data suggest that Thr250 is the critical amino acid responsible for conferring the AA sensitivity to hIK1. It is interesting to note that Chandy and co-workers (36Wulff H. Gutman G.A.

Based on the crystal structure of the KCSA K+ channel (37Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

In light of the data from our T250S-hIK1 construct, it was of interest to determine whether Val275 played a similar role in the AA sensitivity of hIK1. Therefore, we generated separate hIK1 constructs with V275A or the double mutation T250S/V275A to assess the effect of these amino acids on the AA sensitivity of hIK1. A representative experiment for the V275A-hIK1 construct is shown in Fig. 5E. Although AA significantly"

https://openalex.org/W2009407893,"The cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKG) are emerging as important components of mainstream signal transduction pathways. Nitric oxide-induced cGMP formation by stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase is generally accepted as being the most widespread mechanism underlying PKG activation. In the present study, PKG was found to be a target for phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-responsive protein kinase C (PKC). PKG1α became phosphorylated in HEK-293 cells stimulated with PMA and also <i>in vit</i>ro using purified components. PKC-dependent phosphorylation was found to activate PKG as measured by phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, and by <i>in vitro</i> kinase assays. Although there are 11 potential PKC substrate recognition sites in PKG1α, threonine 58 was examined due to its proximity to the pseudosubstrate domain. Antibodies generated against the phosphorylated form of this region were used to demonstrate phosphorylation in response to PMA treatment of the cells with kinetics similar to vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation. A phospho-mimetic mutation at this site (T58E) generated a partially activated PKG that was more sensitive to cGMP levels. A phospho-null mutation (T58A) revealed that this residue is important but not sufficient for PKG activation by PKC. Taken together, these findings outline a novel signal transduction pathway that links PKC stimulation with cyclic nucleotide-independent activation of PKG."

Therefore, an isolation strategy was developed to isolate novel nucleotide compounds from human myocardium. The human myocardial tissue was fractionated by several chromatographic studies. A substance purified to homogeneity was identified as adenosine 5′-tetraphosphate (Ap4) by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS), post-source decay MALDI MS, and enzymatic cleavage analysis. Furthermore, Ap4 was also identified in ventricular specific granules. In the isolated perfused rat heart, Ap4 elicited dose-dependent vasodilations. Vasodilator responses were abolished in the presence of the P2Y1 receptor antagonist MRS 2179 (1 μm) or the NO synthase inhibitorNG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (50 μm). After removal of the endothelium by Triton X-100, Ap4 induced dose-dependent vasoconstrictions. Inhibition of P2X receptors by pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid (30 μm) or desensitization of P2X receptors by α,β-methylene ATP (α,β-meATP, 1 μm) diminished these vasoconstrictor responses completely. In the present study Ap4 has been isolated from human tissue. Ap4was shown to exist in human myocardial tissue and was identified in ventricular specific granules.

To this purpose, an isolation procedure was constructed that was suitable to detect further novel nucleotides secreted by human myocardium. The experiments revealed adenosine 5′-tetraphosphate (Ap4)1 in human myocardial tissue. Moreover, secretory granules contained this nucleotide, and studies in an animal model of coronary circulation revealed potent effects of Ap4 on coronary vascular tone. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Human myocardial tissue was obtained from two graft recipients after heart transplantation. The study was approved by the local ethical committee, and written consent was obtained from the transplant patients. In the hearts used for isolation of nucleotides, coronary heart disease was the primary disorder leading to transplantation. For isolation of adenosine 5′-tetraphosphate only macroscopically intact tissue from the left ventricle was used. After excision from the heart transplant recipient, human myocardial tissue (10 g) was immediately placed in ice-cooled physiological saline solution and processed within 30 min. The following isolation procedure was designed to isolate adenosine 4′-tetraphosphate exclusively from myocardial tissue. The coronary tissue was cut into small pieces (about 1 cm3), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C for 1 night. Then the tissue was lyophilized and powdered (step 1). The powder was suspended in 200 ml of 0.6 m ice-cold perchloric acid and homogenized at 25,000 rpm three times for 1 min. The homogenate was ultracentrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was adjusted with KOH to pH 8.5 and stored at 4 °C for 30 min to precipitate KClO4. After centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was titrated to pH 6.5 with HCl and centrifuged again as above (step 2). A reversed-phase column (Lichroprep RP-18, 310 × 25 mm, Merck) was used to concentrate the nucleotide (step 3). The column was equilibrated with 40 mm triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) in water. The supernatant with 40 mm TEAA added (final concentration) was pumped to the column, washed with 40 mmTEAA, and eluted with 40% acetonitrile in water at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The 40% acetonitrile eluate was collected, frozen at −80 °C, and lyophilized. Size exclusion chromatography was performed according to Hillenkamp and Karas (12Hillenkamp F. Karas M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 280-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) (step 4). Size exclusion gel Sephacryl S-100 high resolution (1000 × 16 mm, S100 HR, Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated with water. The dried sample from the preparative reversed-phase column resolved in 5 ml of water was loaded onto the column. The eluent (water) was pumped at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The effluent was monitored with a UV detector at 254 nm. An anion-exchange column (Fractogel EMD DEAE-650, 300 × 25 mm, Merck) was equilibrated with 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.4) (step 5). After the addition of 10 mm (final concentration) ammonium acetate, pH 7.4, the fraction from the size exclusion chromatography was pumped through the column. Nucleotides were eluted by 1 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 3.0 ml/min. The effluent was detected with a UV detector at 254 nm. The eluate from the anion-exchange column (step 6) was purified further with affinity chromatography. The affinity chromatography gel, phenyl boronic acid coupled to a cation-exchange resin (BioRex 70, Bio-Rad), was synthesized according to Barnes et al. (13Barnes L.D. Robinson A.K. Mumford C.H. Garrison P.N. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 144: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The affinity resin was packed into a glass column (150 × 20 mm) and equilibrated with 1 m ammonium acetate (pH 9.5). The pH of the eluate from the anion-exchange column was adjusted to 9.5 and loaded to the affinity column. The column was washed with 1m ammonium acetate (pH 9.5) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Binding substances were eluted with 1 mm HCl. The eluate was frozen and lyophilized. Fractions were monitored with a UV detector at 254 nm. The fractions from the affinity chromatography were desalted by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Superspher 100 RP C18 end-capped, 250 × 4 mm, Merck) (step 7). The fractions dissolved in eluent A (40 mm TEAA) were injected to the HPLC. After a washing period of 10 min with eluent A, the nucleotide-containing fraction was eluted with 30% acetonitrile in water. The UV-absorbing fraction was collected. The desalted fraction from the affinity chromatography was fractionated by an anion-exchange chromatography (step 8). The anion-exchange column (50 × 5 mm, Mono-Q HR 5/5, Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated with eluent A (10 mm K2HPO4, pH 8.0). The sample dissolved in eluent A was injected into the column at a flow rate of the mobile phase of 0.5 ml/min. Binding substances were eluted using a linear gradient with increasing concentration of eluent B (50 mm K2HPO4 + 1 mNaCl, pH 8.0). The time course of the gradient was: 0–10 min, 0–5% B; 10–100 min, 5–35% B; 100–105 min, 35–40% B; 105–110 min, 40–100% B. The wavelength of the UV detector was fixed to 254 nm. Fractions were collected every 2 min. The fractions from anion-exchange chromatography were further separated by reversed-phase HPLC (Superspher 100 RP C18 end-capped, 250 × 4 mm, Merck) (step 9). The fractions dissolved in eluent A (40 mm TEAA) were injected into the HPLC. The following gradient was programmed: 0–4 min, 0–2% B; 4–79 min, 2–7% B; 79–85 min, 7–60% B. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The wavelength of the UV detector was 254 nm. 1-ml fractions were collected. Specific granules were obtained from porcine left ventricular tissue according to De Bold and Bencosme (14De Bold A.J. Bencosme S.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1973; 7: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, immediately after sacrifice the heart was removed, washed in ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose (containing 0.2% glycogen, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7), and placed in a container with ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose. After large vessels and fat were removed, the tissue was washed for a second time in ice-cold 0.25 msucrose. After 10 g of myocardial tissue was collected, it was homogenized at 4 °C. The resulting pulp was washed into a glass homogenizer with 10 volumes of 0.25 m sucrose. The suspension was homogenized by 20 strokes of a Teflon pestle. The resulting homogenate was filtered using cheesecloth. This filtrate was centrifuged at 1,900 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was filtered again using cheesecloth at 1,900 × g for 10 min and centrifuged at 32,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet containing specific granules was resuspended in 0.25m sucrose and centrifuged again at 32,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended by the addition of 4 ml of 1.6 m sucrose (containing 0.2% glycogen, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7). The remaining pellet was further resuspended by homogenizing it in a glass homogenizer by a Teflon pestle. The suspension was pipetted on top of 0.5 ml of 2m sucrose (containing 0.2% glycogen, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7) and topped with 1 ml of 0.25 m sucrose. The resulting gradient was centrifuged immediately at 154,000 ×g for 60 min. After centrifugation, 5 fractions were obtained. The protein concentration was measured according to Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). The fraction with less than 10% of the total protein amount contained the specific granules. This fraction was collected, diluted to a 10-fold volume with water, and centrifuged at 32,000 ×g for 10 min. The molecular masses of the molecules in the fractions from reversed-phase HPLC (step 9) were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS). A reflectron-type time-of-flight (RETOF) mass spectrometer, equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm; pulse length, 3 ns) was used for ion generation and mass analysis (12Hillenkamp F. Karas M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 280-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In MALDI MS large fractions of the desorbed analyte ions undergo post-source decay (PSD) during flight in the field-free drift path. Using a RETOF set-up, sequence information from PSD fragment ions of precursors produced by MALDI were obtained (16Kaufmann R. Kirsch D. Spengler B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 193: 263-279Google Scholar). For MALDI MS and PSD MALDI MS, speed vacuum-dried samples were dissolved in 10 μl of bidistilled water. 1.0 μl of the 3-hydroxyl-picolinic acid matrix solution (50 g/liter) in water was mixed with 0.5 μl of the sample on a flat metallic support and dried in a stream of cold air. Desorption of analyte ions was performed by laser shots of irradiances in the range of 106 to 107 watts/cm2focused to spot sizes of typically 50 to 100 μm in diameter. The ions generated were accelerated with an energy of 12 KeV for detection. The spectra were recorded using a LeCroy 9400 recorder (17Nordhoff E. Ingendoh A. Cramer R. Overberg A. Stahl B. Karas M. Hillenkamp F. Crain P.F. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 6: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The substances in the fractions of the reversed-phase HPLC (step 9), dissolved in 100 μl (pH 6.5), were analyzed by a UV spectrometer (UV-visible spectrophotometer, DU-600, Beckman). UV absorption was scanned from 400 to 190 nm with a scan speed of 400 nm/min. Aliquots of the fractions from the reversed-phase column (step 9) were incubated with enzymes as follows. The samples were dissolved in: (a) 20 μl of 200 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.9) and incubated with 3 milliunits of 5′-nucleotide hydrolase from Crotalus durissus(EC 3.1.15.1, Roche Applied Science), purified according to Sulkowski and Laskowski (18Sulkowski E. Laskowski S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 240: 443-447Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar), for 9 min at 37 °C; (b) 20 μl of 200 mm Tris and 20 mm EDTA buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated with 3′-nucleotide hydrolase (1 milliunit; from calf spleen, EC 3.1.16.1, from Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37 °C; and (c) 20 μl of 10 mm Tris, 1 mmZnCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 buffer (pH 8) and incubated with alkaline phosphatase (1 milliunit; from calf intestinal mucosa, EC 3.1.3.1, from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by an ultrafiltration with a centrifuge filter (exclusion limit 10 kDa, Millipore). After filtration of the enzymatic cleavage products, the filtrate, dissolved in 980 μl eluent A (10 mmK2HPO4, pH 7), was subjected to an anion-exchange chromatography (MiniQ PC 3.2/3, Amersham Biosciences). The gradient was: 0–3 min, 0% B (50 mmK2HPO4, pH 7 with 1 m NaCl); 3–20 min, 0–50% B; 20–21 min, 50–100% B. The flow rate was 100 μl/min. Isolated perfused rat hearts were taken from male Wistar-Kyoto rats, aged 3 months, weighing 250–300 g, and were prepared according to van der Giet et al. (11van der Giet M. Schmidt S. Tolle M. Jankowski J. Schluter H. Zidek W. Tepel M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 448: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Responses of preparations to Ap4,α,β-methyleneadenosine 5′-triphosphate (α,β-meATP), 2-methylthioadenosine 5′-triphosphate (2-meSATP), and 2-chloroadenosine 5′-triphosphate (2-ClATP) were assessed at basal tone. Dose-response curves were constructed for each substance, with 5 min allowed to elapse between consecutive doses. This procedure allowed for dose-response curves for several agonists to be constructed for the same preparation. Desensitization was not detected when 5 min was allowed to elapse between consecutive doses. Single doses of sodium nitroprusside (10 nmol) and acetylcholine (10 nmol) were used as controls for endothelium-independent or endothelium-dependent vasodilations mediated via NO. Further experiments were done after endothelium was removed by Triton X-100, to investigate the endothelium-independent effects of all of the agonists used. The endothelium was removed by perfusion of the isolated heart for 5 s with 0.1% Triton X-100. Successful removal was verified by the acetylcholine response. Unaffected K+-induced contractions (130 mm bolus) indicated intact vascular smooth muscle cell function. In some experiments with removed endothelia, P2X receptors were desensitized by permanent perfusion with α,β-meATP (1 μm) to block P2X-mediated vasoconstriction. The specific P2Y1 receptor antagonist, 2′-deoxy-N6-methyl-adenosine 3′,5′-diphosphate diammonium (MRS2179, 1 μm), the P2X receptor antagonist pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid (PPADS, 10 μm), and the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitorNG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 10 μm) were added to the perfusate 30 min before challenge with mono- or dinucleotides. MRS2179 and PPADS did not significantly influence vascular tone, whereasl-NAME significantly (p < 0.05) increased perfusion pressure. Permanent perfusion with α,β-meATP showed a rapid and completely desensitizing vasoconstriction. Each of the monoadenosinephosphates, sodium nitroprusside, and acetylcholine was applied as a 100-μl bolus into a valve proximal to the preparation. Drug dilutions were performed daily from stock solutions of 10 mm (concentrates were stored frozen in bidistilled water) with Krebs-Henseleit buffer unless indicated otherwise. Heparin (sodium salt), PPADS, MRS2179, α,β-meATP, 2-meSATP, and 2ClATP were from Research Biochemicals Inc. (Deisenhofen, Germany). Responses were measured as changes in perfusion pressure (mm Hg), and results were presented as the means ± S.E. Two-way repeated measures of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test (for changes in coronary perfusion pressure) were used to identify where statistically significant differences had occurred. The effects of l-NAME, MRS2179, PPADS, and α,β-meATP on coronary perfusion pressure were compared with drug-free control conditions using the Mann-Whitney test. All p values presented are two-tailed, and p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Human ventricular myocardial tissue from transplant recipients was lyophilized and powdered (step 1). Homogenized powder was deproteinated by perchloric acid (step 2). Nucleotides were concentrated from the supernatant by reversed-phase chromatography (step 3). The concentrate was fractionated with size exclusion chromatography (step 4). The resulting chromatogram is presented in Fig.1A. Anionic substances with a molecular mass between 300 and 2000 Da (indicated by a solid line in Fig. 1A) were concentrated by an anion-exchange HPLC (step 5). The resulting chromatogram is shown in Fig.1B. The fraction indicated by a solid line in Fig. 1B was further fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC (steps 6 and 7) and by anion-exchange chromatography (step 8). The corresponding chromatogram is shown in Fig. 1C. Thearrow in Fig. 1C indicates the fraction that was further screened for nucleotides. This fraction was passed through an affinity column to concentrate mononucleoside polyphosphates. The resulting eluate was desalted by a reversed-phase column and fractionated for a final time by anion-exchange chromatography. The fraction indicated by an arrow in Fig. 1C was analyzed by MALDI MS. The UV-absorbing fraction revealed a molecular mass of 588.2 Da [M+H]+. The UV spectrum of this fraction at pH 7.0 showed maximum and minimum absorbances at 259 nm and 230 nm, respectively, indicating the presence of an adenine moiety. The fraction labeled in Fig. 1C was analyzed by PSD-MALDI MS to obtain fragment ion masses (Fig. 2). The fragment ions showed masses identical to those of phosphate, adenosine, AMP, and ADP. The PSD-MALDI MS fragment spectrum of authentic AP4 showed an identical fragment ion pattern (TableI). The measured fragment ions of the fraction labeled in Fig. 1C and of authentic AP4are listed in Table I together with an interpretation of the fragments. The above measurements therefore revealed a molecule containing adenosine together with four phosphate moieties. In a further series of experiments, the connection of the adenosine to the phosphate moieties was studied. To this end, enzymatic cleavage experiments were done. 3′-Exonuclease had no effect on the purified nucleotide, whereas alkaline phosphatase yielded AMP, ADP, and ATP. After incubation of the fraction with 5′-exonuclease, AMP was detected (Fig. 3). The results suggested that in the molecule a chain of four phosphate groups is bound to adenosine via a 5′-phosphodiester bond.Table IFragment ionic masses measured by PSD-MALDI MSMasses of fragment ions of AP41-aMasses of the fragment ions obtained by PSD-MALDI mass spectrometry of the fractions labeled Ap4 (Fig.1C, arrow).

As shown in Fig. 4, Ap4 was found in ventricular specific granules. The amount of Ap4 was estimated to be 4.3 μmol/g wet tissue according to the UV absorption signal in the chromatogram. In isolated perfused rat heart experiments, the mean coronary flow rate as measured in a total of 51 experiments amounted to 8.3 ± 1.8 ml/min to achieve a constant coronary perfusion pressure of 60 ± 1 mm Hg. MRS2179 and PPADS did not significantly change vascular tone, whereas l-NAME significantly (p < 0.05) increased perfusion pressure. Permanent perfusion with α,β-meATP elicited a rapidly desensitizing vasoconstriction. Fig. 5 demonstrates the action of 2-meSATP, 2-ClATP, α,β-meATP, and Ap4 on coronary vasculature. At base-line perfusion pressure the nucleotides, except for α,β-meATP, caused dose-dependent vasodilation. The dose-response curves were not parallel, and the maximal contractions induced varied considerably, which makes calculation of potency ratios difficult; but based on an estimation of concentrations equi-effective to 1 nmol of 2-ClATP, the rank order of potency was Ap4 ≥ 2-ClATP ≥ 2-meSATP. After removal of the endothelium by Triton X-100, vasodilator responses to a 10-nmol bolus of Ap4, 2-ClATP, and 2-meSATP were abolished, and vasoconstrictor responses increased, as shown in Fig. 6B. Vasodilations induced by sodium nitroprusside did not change after removal of the endothelium. With intact endothelium, both inhibition of P2Y1 receptors by MRS2179 (1 μm) and inhibition of NO generation by l-NAME (50 μm) abolished vasodilator responses to Ap4, 2-ClATP, and 2-meSATP (Fig. 6A); vasodilations induced by sodium nitroprusside and vasoconstrictions induced by α,β-meATP remained unaffected (Fig. 6A). In the absence of intact endothelium, vasoconstrictor responses to Ap4, 2-ClATP, 2-meSATP, and α,β-meATP disappeared after the addition of either the P2X receptor antagonist PPADS (30 μm, Fig.6B) or the P2X receptor agonist α,β-meATP (1 μm, Fig. 6B). In this experimental setting, Ap4, 2-ClATP and 2-meSATP did not affect basal tone significantly. In the present study the presence of Ap4 in human myocardial tissue has been demonstrated. Furthermore, Ap4has also been identified in ventricular specific granules. Ap4 exerts P2Y1 receptor-mediated vasodilation and P2X receptor-mediated vasoconstriction on coronary vasculature. Although to the best of our knowledge Ap4 has not yet been demonstrated in human metabolism, its presence in mammalian tissues has been documented in a number of thorough experiments, most of which were performed several decades ago (19Marrian D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1953; 12: 492Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 20Lieberman I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 3373-3375Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 21Small G. Cooper C. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Van Dyke K. Robinson R. Urquilla P. Smith D. Taylor M. Trush M. Wilson M. Pharmacology. 1977; 15: 377-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Gualix J. Abal M. Pintor J. Miras-Portugal M.T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Like most nucleotides Ap4 may have either intracellular or extracellular functions. On the one hand, Ap4 may be involved in intracellular metabolic pathways, serving either for cellular energy supply or for intracellular signal transduction. On the other hand, Ap4 may indeed serve as an extracellular messenger, as suggested by its vascular effects. An extracellular action cannot be inferred from the mere existence of Ap4 in myocardial tissue. However, the isolation of this compound from myocardial secretory granules strongly suggests that Ap4 is produced in cardiomyocytes to act as an extracellular messenger. The characterization of the vasoactive properties of Ap4 revealed several interesting findings. 1) Although the structure of Ap4 is very similar to that of ATP, Ap4 has a longer biological half-life than ATP. ATP is degraded to more than 95% during a single coronary passage. The levels of ATP in the coronary circulation increase during conditions of hypoxia or ischemia, suggesting a possible role of nucleotides as extracellular mediators of pathological processes in atherosclerotic vessels. The ATP content in human myocardial tissue is about 40 μmol/g wet tissue (24Starling R.C. Hammer D.F. Altschuld R.A. Mol Cell Biochem. 1998; 180: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Compared with ATP, the concentration of Ap4 is about 10 times lower, but Ap4 has a longer half-life in the circulation, as it is more resistant to extracellular nucleotidases than ATP (25Lee J.W. Kong I.D. Park K.S. Korean J. Physiol. 1995; 29: 217-223Google Scholar). Therefore the findings suggest that Ap4 may exert a least equivalent actions to those of ATP from a quantitative point of view. 2) The findings reveal that the activity of Ap4 is profoundly dependent on endothelial integrity. Ap4 is a potent vasodilator in intact coronary vasculature. In the absence of endothelial P2Y1 receptors, Ap4 is a vasoconstrictor. This endothelium-dependent action may be relevant with respect to coronary pathology. It may be speculated that in severely atherosclerotic coronary vessels, Ap4 may be a mediator of vasospastic processes. 3) The actions of Ap4 are mediated by several of the known purinoceptor subtypes. Ap4-induced vasoconstriction depends on the activation of an α,β-meATP-sensitive, completely desensitizable P2Xreceptor subtype. Only mRNAs for P2X1, P2X2, and P2X4 have been detected in coronary vasculature thus far (26Nori S. Fumagalli L. Bo X. Bogdanov Y. Burnstock G. J. Vasc. Res. 1998; 35: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Additionally the P2X5 receptor was cloned in rat heart (27Garcia-Guzman M. Soto F. Laube B. Stuhmer W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In accordance with pertinent literature, the P2X2 receptor and the P2X5 receptor are not activated by α,β-meATP (27Garcia-Guzman M. Soto F. Laube B. Stuhmer W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 28Evans R.J. Lewis C. Buell G. Valera S. North R.A. Surprenant A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar). The P2X4 receptor cannot be inhibited by PPADS (29Bo X. Zhang Y. Nassar M. Burnstock G. Schoepfer R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The P2X1 receptor is inhibitable by PPADS, sensitive to α,β-meATP, and completely desensitizable (28Evans R.J. Lewis C. Buell G. Valera S. North R.A. Surprenant A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore it can be speculated that the P2X1 receptor subtype underlies Ap4-induced vasoconstriction. P2X receptor subtypes are known to form hetero-oligomeric channels with new pharmacological properties. Among P2X1, P2X2, P2X4, and P2X5, only P2X1 and P2X5 are reportedly able to assemble (30Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6653-6659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). It cannot finally be excluded that a hetero-oligmeric form of P2X1 and P2X5, in addition to the P2X1 receptor, contributes to Ap4-induced vasoconstriction. On the other hand, Ap4-induced vasodilation is mediated by the P2Y1 receptor subtype, as evidenced by specific inhibition of P2Y1 receptor with MRS2179. From the literature, it is known that P2Y1 receptors is expressed abundantly on endothelial cell surfaces and therefore is responsible for the vasodilator action of Ap4 (31Hopwood A.M. Burnstock G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 136: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Beyond the isolation and characterization of Ap4, our experiments suggest that endogenous myocardium-derived nucleotides may be an important part of the spectrum of myocardial endocrine functions. Using the isolation procedure established in the present study, it will be possible to screen extracts from myocardial tissue for further functionally relevant, novel nucleotides. Because several other vasoactive nucleotides have been described recently in human myocardial tissue (3Luo J. Jankowski J. Knobloch M. Van der Giet M. Gardanis K. Russ T. Vahlensieck U. Neumann J. Schmitz W. Tepel M. Deng M.C. Zidek W. Schluter H. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it may be speculated that the myocardium-derived nucleotide hormones comprise a larger and more complex family of extracellular messengers than known in the last few decades."

https://openalex.org/W1878067631,"Recent announcements that the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) - the faint remnant of the Big Bang - is polarized have caused a stir among cosmologists. Such polarization has long been predicted but could not be detected, until the recent DASI and WMAP detections. The polarization is a signature of the motion of the primordial seeds that led to the galaxies and large-scale structure of the Universe observed today. Earlier measurements of tiny temperature fluctuations in the CMB have been used to infer the sizes of the primordial seeds. The polarization signature should help to determine the fundamental parameters of cosmology and to explain how large-scale structure arose [Highwire abstract]."
