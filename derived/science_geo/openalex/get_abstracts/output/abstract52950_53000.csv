https://openalex.org/W1612160157,"Abstract A number of degradative enzymes are specifically released from exponentially growing Escherichia coli by osmotic shock. They include alkaline phosphatase, cyclic phosphodiesterase, 5'-nucleotidase, acid phosphatase, and the ribonucleic acid-inhibited endonuclease that is active with deoxyribonucleic acid. Small amounts of RNase are also set free, but some 16 control enzymes are found to remain within the cell. Only about 4% of the cellular protein is released into the shock medium. The procedure for osmotic shock has been modified in order to obtain about 80% viability with exponential cells, with good release of enzymes. In the first stage, cells are exposed to 20% sucrose-1 x 10-4 M EDTA. In the second stage, the pellet of sucrose-treated cells is rapidly dispersed in cold 5 x 10-4 M MgCl2, which causes the enzymes to be liberated. At least 90% of the DNA endonuclease and 50% of the latent ribonuclease are released from exponentially growing E. coli when as much as 2 x 10-2 M MgCl2 is used in the procedure for osmotic shock."
https://openalex.org/W1566125473,"The activity of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the N-methylation of noradrenaline to form adrenaline, falls following hypophysectomy. Enzyme activity can be restored by injections of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or of dexamethasone, a potent synthetic glucocorticoid. The effect of ACTH on the adrenaline-forming enzyme is not direct, but involves stimulation of the release of endogenous glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. These steroids then act to elevate the activity of the transferase, which is principally localized in the adrenal medulla. The stimulation by glucocorticoids of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity can be blocked by the concurrent administration of puromycin or actinomycin D. Glucocorticoids do not stimulate the activity of other adrenal enzymes involved in catecholamine biosynthesis or metabolism, such as tyrosine hydroxylase, catechol O-methyltransferase, or monoamine oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1513366186,"Abstract Well preserved mitochondria were isolated from Saccharomyces carlsbergensis by a procedure which involves digestion of the cell wall with snail gut juice. The yeast mitochondria thus prepared oxidized members of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, d- and l-lactate, and tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine reduced by ascorbate. Respiratory control in response to the addition of adenosine diphosphate was observed with all of these substrates. The highest respiratory control ratio (5 to 6) was obtained with α-ketoglutarate as substrate. The yeast mitochondria actively oxidized externally added NADH, and this oxidation likewise showed respiratory control. The ADP to oxygen or phosphorus to oxygen ratios observed in this system were about 0.9 with tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine and lactate; 1.7 with succinate, NADH, citrate, and pyruvate plus catalytic amount of malate; and 2.5 with α-ketoglutarate. These respirations were completely insensitive to Amytal and rotenone. It is suggested that phosphorylation Site I is absent from these yeast mitochondria. Effects of uncouplers and inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation on yeast mitochondria were very similar to those observed with mammalian mitochondria. The P:O ratios in the respiration with NADH as a substrate showed constant values when measured between pH 5.4 and 7.5, and at a range of tonicity between 0.3 and 1.0 m sorbitol. The yeast mitochondria could be stored for a long period of time without appreciable loss of phosphorylation activity. The components of electron transport of isolated yeast mitochondria were studied by means of difference spectrophotometry. Electron micrographs of the isolated yeast mitochondria and mitochondria in situ were also presented."
https://openalex.org/W1529436486,"Abstract When D-1,2-propanediol is converted to propionaldehyde in the presence of dioldehydrase and dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide coenzyme, 1 of 2 C-1 hydrogens of the substrate is stereospecifically transferred to position C-2. The hydrogen transferred is the hydrogen introduced into D-1,2-propanediol by horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase when D-lactaldehyde is reduced to D-1,2-propanediol. When L-1,2-propanediol reacts, the other C-1 hydrogen exclusively is transferred. The displacement of the secondary hydroxyl group of propanediol by hydrogen, which takes place when D- or L-1,2-propanediol is converted to propionaldehyde, occurs with inversion of configuration at C-2. These results suggest that the removal of the secondary hydroxyl group may proceed through a displacement reaction in which the hydride functions as displacing nucleophile. It was also shown that the reduction of D- and L-lactaldehyde with horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase and α-deuterated reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide leads to D- and L-propanediol of identical configuration at C-1. Therefore, the stereochemical course of the reduction by horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase is not influenced by the configuration of the carbon adjacent to the center which is reduced."
https://openalex.org/W1498824723,"Abstract 1. The observation that low concentrations of oligomycin stimulated oxidative phosphorylation in A-particles has been confirmed and extended. 2. Oligomycin was found to stimulate each of the three sites of oxidative phosphorylation, but optimal phosphorylation rates were obtained only when coupling factors were added as well. The P:O ratio with succinate was raised from 0.06 with particles alone to over 1.5 when coupling factors 1, 2, and 4, oligomycin, and thioglycerol were added. 3. The relatively high rates of oxidative phosphorylation in the presence of oligomycin or of any pair of coupling factors suggested that residual amounts of coupling factors were present in A-particles. 4. This suggestion was borne out by studies with an antibody against coupling factor 1, which inhibited ATPase, 32Pi-ATP exchange, and oxidative phosphorylation at all three sites in submitochondrial particles. The stimulation of oxidative phosphorylation by oligomycin in A-particles was abolished by the antibody against F1."
https://openalex.org/W1479797101,"Abstract The nature of the carbohydrate-protein linkage in the chondroitin 4-sulfate-protein complex of bovine nasal septum has been investigated. Two carbohydrate-serine compounds, xylosylserine and galactosylxylosylserine, were isolated from the complex by enzymatic degradation followed by mild acid hydrolysis. Their structures were established as O-β-d-xylopyranosyl-l-serine and 4-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-O-β-d-xylopyranosyl-l-serine. These findings show that the carbohydrate-protein linkage in the chondroitin 4-sulfate-protein complex is a glycosidic linkage between xylose and the hydroxyl group of serine."
https://openalex.org/W1551848857,"Abstract 1. Kinetic data concerning the substrate and product inhibition by pyruvate and l-lactate have been obtained with the M4 and H4 fractions separated from crystalline rabbit muscle lactic dehydrogenase. 2. The studies indicate that the product inhibition by l-lactate or by pyruvate is predominantly noncompetitive for both the M4 and H4 isozymes. Ki values for product inhibition by l-lactate were 130 mm for the M4 isozyme and 26.0 mm for the H4 isozyme. Ki values for product inhibition by pyruvate were 0.28 mm for the M4 isozyme and 0.18 mm for the H4 isozyme. 3. At the concentrations of pyruvate and l-lactate reported by others in contracting muscle, substrate inhibition does not occur to any significant extent under our experimental conditions. However, there is a marked difference in the extent of product inhibition by l-lactate of pyruvate reduction for the two isozymes, but very little difference in the product inhibition by pyruvate of l-lactate oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1518469907,"Abstract 1. The reversible dissociation of lactic and malic dehydrogenases has been studied in detail and compared with the dissociation properties of triosephosphate dehydrogenase, α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, and liver alcohol dehydrogenase. 2. Evidence is presented for the existence of an intermediate form of lactic dehydrogenase with catalytic properties altered during reactivation. 3. The technique of reversible dissociation has been used to prepare interspecies hybrids of lactic, malic, and triosephosphate dehydrogenases. 4. Some of the catalytic and immunological properties of hybrid malic dehydrogenases have been examined. 5. The effects of salts on the reactivation of malic dehydrogenases have been investigated and related to previous results on lactic dehydrogenases. It is proposed that the observed salt effects may result from changes in the activity coefficients of the exposed peptide and amide groups."
https://openalex.org/W1562248446,"Abstract Cytochrome oxidase, prepared from the electron transport particles of yeast, has been purified approximately 5- to 6-fold. The enzyme preparation contained copper, nonheme iron, labile sulfide, and cytochromes a + a3 in approximately equimolar amounts, and 25 to 30% lipid on a dry weight basis. Difference spectra (reduced minus oxidized) of the enzyme preparation showed absorption maxima at 445 and 604 mµ and a small broad peak at 650 to 750 mµ, but no change in absorbance was found in the region 800 to 900 mµ. Yeast cytochrome oxidase was strongly inhibited by cyanide, azide, diethyldithiocarbamate, and ethylenediaminetetraacetate, but not by p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonic acid or antimycin A."

https://openalex.org/W1496347782,"Abstract At least two enzymatic steps have been shown to participate in the biosynthesis of inositol from glucose 6-phosphate. The first one, catalyzed by glucose-6-P cyclase, leads to the formation of d-inositol-1-P and has an absolute requirement for diphosphopyridine nucleotide. NH4+ accelerates the rate of this reaction 5-fold. In the second step, catalyzed by a phosphatase, d-inositol-1-P is hydrolyzed to inositol and inorganic orthophosphate. Mg++ ions are necessary for this reaction. The inositol phosphate formed in the cyclase reaction was isolated by ion exchange chromatography and was identified as d-inositol-1-P by paper chromatography, its molar ratio of inositol to phosphorus, and its specific optical rotation."
https://openalex.org/W1491850831,"Abstract A plausible kinetic scheme for interaction of Escherichia coli inorganic pyrophosphatase with pyrophosphate and its magnesium complexes has been deduced by computer model-fitting procedures. Zero order enzyme velocities were measured in pH 9.1 solutions in which the concentrations of free pyrophosphate, Mg2+pyrophosphate, and (Mg2+)2pyrophosphate were estimated from determined association constants. The resultant data fit well a model in which free pyrophosphate was competitive inhibitor (Ki = 10-7 m), Mg2+pyrophosphate was substrate (Km = 5 x 10-6 m), and (Mg2+)2pyrophosphate was bound (as a competitive inhibitor) relatively weakly if at all. Binding of inorganic tri- and tetrapolyphosphates, also substrates for this enzyme, was estimated by studies of competitive inhibition; their approximate binding constants were 10-5 and 10-4 m, respectively. During enzymatic hydrolysis of these polyphosphates, no free intermediates could be detected. It is concluded that the active site of the enzyme carries one or more positive charges at pH 9.1 and that it is of limited dimensions. A structure for Mg2+pyrophosphate, the active substrate, is proposed wherein the divalent cation closes a stable, 6-membered ring in the complex and restricts rotation about the pyrophosphate phosphoanhydride bonds. If catalytic action entails motion of the enzyme, this fixation could conceivably facilitate hydrolysis of bound substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1556596418,"Abstract Rat liver microsomal glucose 6-phosphatase previously has been shown to catalyze an inorganic pyrophosphate-glucose phosphotransferase reaction. Citrate, which has been employed as a buffer in some earlier studies of this enzyme, recently has been found to inhibit both of these activities. Detailed investigations of the inhibition of both phosphohydrolase and phosphotransferase reactions by this tricarboxylic acid have been carried out with enzyme prepared by fractional ammonium sulfate precipitation of deoxycholate-treated rat liver microsomal preparations. These studies involved (a) kinetic analysis of inhibition of both activities, including an evaluation of Km and Ki values at a variety of hydrogen ion concentration levels, and (b) investigations of inhibitor specificity. Inhibition, which was observed only below pH 7, was found in all instances to be competitive with respect to phosphate substrate and noncompetitive with respect to glucose. Kglucose (0.083 M) was independent of pH. Km values for glucose 6-phosphate and pyrophosphate and Ki (citrate) values were markedly dependent on pH. Minimal values were observed at the following pH values: KPPi = 0.94 mM at pH 6.1, Kglucose-6-P = 0.42 mM at pH 6.5, and Ki, (citrate) ≅ 6 mM at pH 5.6. Good agreement was observed between Ki (citrate) values determined with both the phosphohydrolase and phosphotransferase activities over the entire pH range studied (pH 4.65 to 6.5). This finding lends additional substantiation for the common identity of both enzymic activities. Of a variety of citrate analogues and other chelating agents and buffers tested, only oxalate approached citrate in effectiveness as an inhibitor. Dixon (38) plots of both pKm and pKi values with respect to pH suggest the possible participation of an imidazolium group of a histidine residue of the enzyme in enzyme-substrate complexation. The results also reveal that KPPi values are appreciably smaller than reported earlier; at pH 6.1, KPPi (0.94 mM) is approximately one-fifth of that previously determined with citrate as buffer. A comparison of activity-pH profiles of pyrophosphate-glucose phosphotransferase and glucokinase indicates that, on the basis of units of activity per g of wet liver, the latter is the principal hepatic glucose-phosphorylating activity above pH 7, while the former activity predominates below this hydrogen ion concentration. A possible role for citrate as an agent regulating pyrophosphate-glucose phosphotransferase and hepatic glucose utilization in general is suggested."

https://openalex.org/W1635743539,"Abstract Purified preparations of cytochrome oxidase solubilized in bile acid exhibit random aggregations of subunit particles of about 50 and 100 A in diameter. When the bile acids are removed, the subunit particles organize into vesicular membranes. Removal of phospholipid from cytochrome oxidase eliminates the capacity of the subunits to organize into vesicles. This capacity is restored by adding back mitochondrial phospholipid to the lipid-depleted particles."
https://openalex.org/W1495345528,"Abstract 1. The role of the copper in highly purified bovine adrenal 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine β-hydroxylase (dopamine β-hydroxylase) has been studied with the use of electron paramagnetic resonance techniques. The results confirm our previous findings. Most of the protein-bound Cu2+ is reduced by treatment of the enzyme with ascorbate; a large part of the Cu+ in the reduced enzyme is reoxidized during the hydroxylation of substrate. These results support a reduction-oxidation role for the protein-bound copper. 2. Fumarate, an activator of dopamine β-hydroxylase, appears to favor the oxidation of Cu+ to Cu2+. This effect of fumarate is discussed in terms of the mechanism of action of dopamine β-hydroxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1604445711,"Nicotinamide has a much longer half-life than nicotinic acid, both in liver and in blood. These observations, considered together with the known inhibitory action of high levels of nicotinic acid on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthesis, explain the greater efficacy of nicotinamide than of nicotinic acid as a precursor of NAD in vivo, despite the fact that nicotinic acid is an intermediate in the synthesis of NAD from nicotinamide. At high dose levels, the half-life both of nicotinamide and of nicotinic acid is determined primarily by the rate of urinary excretion of the unchanged compound, and not by metabolic transformation. At low dose levels, both compounds are excreted primarily as metabolites rather than as unchanged compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1568545234,"1. The influence of glucosylation of deoxyribonucleic acid on the hydrolysis by the four deoxyribonucleases of Escherichia coli has been described. 2. Exonuclease II, the nuclease associated with DNA polymerase, and exonuclease III (DNA phosphatase-exonuclease) hydrolyze DNA from T-even bacteriophages at less than 5% the rate of T7 DNA. Exonuclease I and endonuclease I hydrolyze T-even deoxyribonucleic acids at only slightly diminished rates compared to those observed with T7 DNA. 3. DNA isolated from T*2 or T*6 bacteriophages contains hydroxymethylcytosine in place of cytosine but is deficient in glucose. T*2 and T*6 deoxyribonucleic acids are degraded by exonuclease III at rates approximately 20-fold greater than those found for T2 and T6 DNA. Glucosylation of T*2 DNA by UDP-glucose and by the T2 α-glucosyltransferase converts T*2 DNA into a substrate which is hydrolyzed at the diminished rates found for normal T2 DNA. 4. The phosphatase activity of exonuclease III is not significantly influenced by glucosylation of the DNA substrates."

https://openalex.org/W1528030880,"Abstract Endonuclease activity has been found to be closely associated with mitochondria of Neurospora crassa. The evidence for this association is that: (a) the activity sediments with mitochondria even after extensive washing; (b) purified nuclease is not bound by freshly prepared mitochondria; (c) nuclease and cytochrome oxidase activities cosediment through a sucrose gradient; and (d) the mitochondria must be disrupted in order to observe significant activity. The possibility has not been eliminated, however, that this association represents the binding to mitochondria of a nuclease of extramitochondrial origin. The enzyme has been purified from both mitochondria and crude mycelial extracts. It degrades both deoxyribonucleic and ribonucleic acids to small oligonucleotides terminated by 5'-phosphomonoester groups, is most active at 37°, between pH values of 6.0 and 7.5, requires a divalent cation (Mg++, Mn++, or Co++), is inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and is relatively unaffected by β-mercaptoethanol. These catalytic properties distinguish it from the extramitochondrial nuclease previously described in N. crassa."
https://openalex.org/W1509627068,"The activation of phosphoglucomutase prior to the enzymic assay is interpreted in terms of the direct removal of inhibiting metals or their replacement by Mg2+ which occurs readily only in the absence or in the presence of very low concentrations of substrate. Inhibition of the enzyme by high concentrations of Mg2+ is caused by the formation of inactive magnesium complexes of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 1,6-diphosphate and is complicated by dead-end substrate inhibition. Inhibition by chloride, acetate, bromide, nitrate, iodide, and perchlorate increases in the order listed. The pKaa3 and pKaa4 of glucose 1,6-diphosphoric acid are 6.0 and 6.8, respectively, at ionic strength of 0.024, thus ruling out the possibility of a stable hydrogen bond between the two phosphate groups in the trianion. Comparison of the binding of Mg2+ by glucose-1-P and glucose-1,6-di-P indicates that bidentate binding effects involving the two phosphate groups of glucose-1,6-di-P are unimportant."

The catalytic properties of phosphohydrolase and phosphotransferase activities of the kidney enzyme were found to be very similar to those of corresponding hepatic activities (11, 15). Formation and hydrolysis of glucose 6-phosphate by phosphotransferase and phosphohydrolase activities, respectively, of this enzyme are postulated to play a role in the transport of glucose across the kidney tubular cell of the diabetic animal."
https://openalex.org/W1606742107,"1. An alternative simplified procedure is described for the isolation of a 30-residue peptide obtained by digestion with collagenase of carp swim bladder tropocollagen (ichthyocol). The peptide contains an aldehydic component as a 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone. The aldehyde dinitrophenylhydrazone is present in stoichiometric proportion to the amino acids in the peptide. 2. This peptide is shown to be devoid of free terminal amino groups by lack of reactivity with ninhydrin or phenylisothiocyanate. Since it is prepared by treatment with collagenase and yet devoid of any terminal α-amino group including that of a glycine residue, the peptide most likely arises from a blocked amino-terminal position of a tropocollagen chain. 3. The aldehyde-bearing component most likely is not bound to any of the following amino acid side chains for the reasons given: (a) to side chain carboxyl groups of glutamyl or aspartyl residues in ester linkage, since treatment with aqueous hydrazine does not release the dinitrophenylhydrazone from the peptide; (b) to the hydroxyl group of a serine residue by means of a glycosidic-like attachment, since mild treatment with NaOH does not promote β elimination in the serine; (c) to side chains of either threonine, hydroxylysine, hydroxyproline, lysine, arginine, or histidine, since residues of these are not present in the peptide; (d) to the hydroxyl side chain of a tyrosine residue, since this amino acid, while present in the aldehyde-dinitrophenylhydrazone-peptide obtained following digestion with collagenase, is absent from the aldehyde-dinitrophenylhydrazone-peptide obtained by further digestion with Pronase. 4. The peptide obtained with collagenase is cleaved further into at least seven peptides which have been partially characterized. A yellow heptapeptide containing the aldehydic component as a 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine derivative is also without free amino groups, and this locates the aldehyde-bearing component within 7 residues of a blocked amino terminus of a tropocollagen chain. 5. Ultraviolet absorption spectra of derivatives of the aldehyde component, and its tendency to undergo acid-catalyzed α,β-dehydration to α,β-unsaturated aldehyde derivatives, suggest that its first 3 carbon atoms are involved in a β-hydroxyaldehyde structure. The aldehyde-bearing component must contain an additional functional group with which it makes covalent attachment to the protein. 6. It is suggested that the aldehyde component, by virtue of its chemical nature, reactivity, stoichiometry, and location in the protein, may be involved in the maturation and cross-linking of soluble tropocollagen to form insoluble mature tissue collagen."

https://openalex.org/W1484528598,"Abstract 1. The influence of D2O and organic solvents on the rate of oxidation of added substrates by heart muscle particles and tightly coupled rat liver mitochondria has been investigated. Solvents examined include glycerol, sucrose, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl formamide, and ethylene glycol. Each of these solvents was found to induce a marked inhibition of respiratory chain activity. 2. The relative constancy in the steady state reduction level of the respiratory carriers at each increment of solvent concentration prevents the assignment of a single specific site of respiratory inhibition, and favors the hypothesis that the solvent effects are due to a nonspecific inhibition which operates in a similar manner at several sites in the respiratory chain. 3. No correlation was found between the inhibition of respiratory activity by solvents and the viscosity of the solvent reaction mixtures. 4. The organic solvent inhibition of the DPNH oxidase activity of heart muscle particles was a linear function of the water content of the solvent reaction mixtures in which the particles were suspended, and independent of the concentration, tonicity, or chemical nature of the solvent used. 5. It is suggested that several protonolytic reactions may be operative during the transfer of reducing equivalents from substrate to oxygen by way of the respiratory chain. The respiratory chain components mediating these reactions are in some manner accessible to, and markedly influenced by, the aqueous phase surrounding the particles, and therefore do not function entirely in a lipid nonaqueous milieu."

https://openalex.org/W1572082182,"Abstract Hepatic glycogen metabolism is investigated with the aid of a mathematical model under the assumptions of steady state conditions for glucose 6-phosphate, glucose 1-phosphate, and uridine diphosphate glucose, and constant concentrations of adenosine triphosphate, uridine triphosphate, inorganic phosphate, and pyrophosphate. The model, which includes a constant rate of gluconeogenesis, contains 32 input parameters, and is based on enzymatic reaction mechanisms and kinetic data in vitro pertaining to six reactions which interconvert blood glucose and liver glycogen. Calculations in the model have been programmed for the IBM-1620 digital computer. The predicted rates of net glucose production and net glycogen synthesis and the steady state concentrations of glucose-6-P and UDP-glucose compare favorably with experimental observations. The glucose-1-P concentration is shown to be near the equilibrium concentration in the phosphoglucomutase reaction. The predicted glucose threshold for net glycogen synthesis is 90 mg/100 ml, and the predicted glucose threshold for net glucose production is 149 mg/100 ml. The results indicate that the hepatic glycogen system is well stabilized in that a 100-fold change in the glucose concentration, from 5 to 500 mg/100 ml, produces about a 2-fold change in the steady state concentrations of the components and in most enzymatic rates. If the inorganic phosphate concentration is taken as a decreasing function of the glucose concentration, the steady state intermediates are further stabilized but more net glucose production and glycogen synthesis result. It is shown that the rate of gluconeogenesis accounts for the separate hepatic thresholds for net glucose production and net glycogen synthesis and for the latter threshold occurring within the normal glucose concentration range. The results imply that mass action effects are more important than the dependence of glycogen synthetase on glucose-6-P in determining the steady state concentration of UDP-glucose. In the model, phosphoglucomutase and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase are near equilibrium, and the amount of either enzyme is not critical. The amount of glucokinase, glucose 6-phosphatase, glycogen synthetase, or phosphorylase is critical even though these enzymes may not be rate-limiting on the basis of maximal velocity data. The necessity of considering UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase as a reversible reaction is established on the basis of maximal velocity data and from the point of view of glycogen synthetase being an effective control point in the system. It is shown that the dependence of glycogen synthetase on glucose-6-P severely limits enzymatic activity but that it allows the enzymatic rate to vary more extensively with changes in the glucose-6-P and UDP-glucose concentrations. The results suggest that the assumption that the reactions occur in a homogeneous phase without compartments is not a good one, and the possibility of two pools of glucose-6-P and glucose-1-P is suggested. A simulation of fasting or diabetes produces results consistent with experimental observation. A simulation of the early effects of glucocorticoid administration raises the question of increased glucose production under conditions of a nonincreasing glucose-6-P concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1547591178,"By use of purified bacterial collagenase it has been possible to demonstrate that a proline-rich, hydroxyproline-deficient, collagenase-degradable protein accumulates in many collagen-forming systems when proline hydroxylation is impaired. These experiments provide further evidence that proline is incorporated into a collagen-like polypeptide prior to hydroxylation. The collagenase-tannic acid procedure may be used as a means of studying collagen synthesis independent of proline hydroxylation."

Such reconstituted mitochondria have only 10 to 20% of the initial concentration of DPN+, but the rates of oxidation, with pyruvate plus malate as substrate, are nearly maximal. Such mitochondria are also capable of carrying out oxidative phosphorylation with high efficiency and have respiratory control ratios between 3 and 6. These findings indicate that maximal rates of oxidation and phosphorylation are compatible with amounts of DPN+ that are no higher than those of the fixed component of the chain (1.2 mµmoles per mg of protein or less)."
https://openalex.org/W1591239187,"The electron spin resonance technique shows that the heat denaturation of oxyhemoglobin involves (a) oxidation to methemoglobin or related material (high spin ferric), (b) conversion to low spin ferric species in an irreversible step, and (c) further changes in these low spin species under drastic conditions. The last two occurrences are observed with methemoglobin. The electron spin resonance spectra obtained upon heat denaturation are ascribed to at least two low spin ferric complexes between hemin and denatured globin. The technique is used to follow the irreversible heat denaturation of oxy- and methemoglobin and to obtain transition temperatures for denaturation. Transition temperatures in the presence of organic solvents, solutes, and salts and in the presence of a few inorganic salts are obtained, and from these molar changes in transition temperatures are estimated. In some cases, the transition temperature is lowered to 23° and below. Organic compounds, except for glycerol and sucrose, all lower transition temperatures, and their effectiveness as denaturants increases as their hydrophobic character increases, with the notable exception of guanidinium chlorides. Among inorganic salts, anions which salt in proteins, such as iodide and thiocyanate, decrease heat stability whereas those which salt out proteins, such as sulfate and citrate, increase stability over that found in water. These data are discussed with regard to protein-solvent interactions. A few organic solutes, notably methanol, formamide, phenol, and urea, can bring about a change in methemoglobin, characterized by a particular electron spin resonance spectrum. The species responsible for the spectrum appears to represent an internal complex between hemin and a slightly perturbed or denatured form of globin."

Analysis of the NH2 and COOH end groups and studies by repeated Edman degradation of the major glycopeptide indicated the sequence, -Ala-Phe-Gly-Asp-Gly-. The carbohydrate unit of this glycopeptide consisted of N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, mannose, and fucose. A disaccharide consisting of glucosamine and galactose was obtained by mild acid hydrolysis, and further study indicated this to be 4-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-d-glucosamine. Periodate oxidation suggested the possibility of branching within the oligosaccharide chain. The glycopeptide unit is similar in many respects to those isolated from glycoproteins from several sources. The other glycopeptide unit which occurred in a lower concentration was unique in that it contained glucose as well as galactose and fucose in the carbohydrate portion. -Gly (Ser, Gly, Phe) Phe- composed the amino acid chain. The site of linkage of the sialic acid to one or both glycopeptides is not known."
https://openalex.org/W1568568101,"Abstract Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to investigate the chemical nature of the phosphorus atoms in bovine αs-casein. A satisfactory 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum can be obtained in a sample containing 26% by weight of the protein in a 6.5 M urea. The average 31P chemical shift of αs-casein is 221 ppm from PCl3 with a standard deviation of 1 ppm over the pH range 4 to 9. The variations with pH of the phosphorus chemical shift of model compounds adenosine 5'-triphosphate, O-phosphoserine, creatine phosphate, reduced β-diphosphopyridine nucleotide, and sodium pyrophosphate fall into two categories: (a) the chemical shifts in compounds with disubstituted pyrophosphate or phosphodiester linkages remain essentially constant in the pH range 4 to 9, whereas (b) for monoester compounds, there is a relatively large change in chemical shift (greater than 4 ppm) as the pH changes from 3 to 9, i.e. as the phosphate group goes from the singly ionized to the doubly ionized state. This difference (which is to be expected from a priori considerations) suggests that there may be phosphodiester or disubstituted pyrophosphate bonds, or both, in bovine αs-casein. The relation of this type of phosphate linkage to the structure of αs-casein and to its stability in aqueous solution is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1576388797,"Abstract Eleven N1-alkylnicotinamide chlorides, varying in the size of the alkyl substituent from the N1-methyl to the N1-dodecyl derivative, were studied as possible inhibitors of catalytic activities associated with crystalline bovine liver glutamic dehydrogenase. The longer chain derivatives (C8 to C12, inclusive) inhibited glutamic dehydrogenase activity with a concomitant stimulation of alanine dehydrogenase activity. This inhibition was demonstrated to be noncompetitive with respect to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide when studied in a low NAD+ concentration range and was greatly facilitated by the presence of NADH. These longer chain derivatives were also shown to reverse the adenosine diphosphate activation of glutamic dehydrogenase activity. A chain length effect was observed in the inhibition of glutamic dehydrogenase by these compounds, indicating the importance of hydrophobic interactions in their functioning, which was suggested to occur through the stabilization of the monomeric form of the enzyme having alanine dehydrogenase activity. Shorter chain N1-alkylnicotinamide chlorides (N1-hexyl or smaller) were shown to stimulate glutamic dehydrogenase activity with a concomitant inhibition of alanine dehydrogenase activity. No chain length effect was observed in the functioning of these shorter chain derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W1898127640,"Abstract The pathway of synthesis by Streptomyces griseus of the streptose moiety of streptomycin from D-glucose has been studied. L-Serine-3-14C, D-glucose-l-14C, D-glucose-2-14C, D-glucose-3,4-14C, and D-glucose-6-14C were given to streptomycin-producing cultures. A 40 to 46% incorporation of 14C into the streptose moiety of the isolated streptomycin was found. Procedures for the total degradation of streptose were developed and utilized to determine the 14C-label pattern in this moiety. Examination of the isotope distribution data for the 6 carbons of streptose after administration of the above labeled compounds to the organism shows that streptose arises from a carbon-carbon rearrangement at carbon atoms 3 and 4 of glucose to form the branched sugar, streptose."
https://openalex.org/W1625907927,"Abstract An enzymatic system which reduces nicotinamide N-oxide to nicotinamide was isolated from hog liver and purified about 280-fold. The reduction is dependent on the presence of reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide or a low molecular weight constituent found in boiled liver supernatant. The two cofactors appear to be involved in the expression of two distinct enzymatic activities. Evidence has been presented which indicates both activities may be associated with a single protein or enzymatic unit. The DPNH-dependent reaction is the following. H+ + DPNH + nicotinamide N-oxide → DPN+ + nicotinamide + H2O The nature of the supernatant-dependent reaction is not completely understood, since the identity of the compound which is oxidized in the course of reduction of the N-oxide is not known."
https://openalex.org/W1601728385,"Abstract The purified β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and steroid Δ-isomerase of Pseudomonas testosteroni have been incubated, both separately and together, with testosterone-4-14C and reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide. Substantial yields of androst-4-ene-3β,17β-diol were obtained whenever the dehydrogenase was present, while androst-5-ene-3β, 17β-diol was formed only when both the dehydrogenase and the isomerase were incubated. No radioactive products were detected when only the isomerase was incubated or in the absence of either enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1582409255,"Abstract The relationship between cofactors and glycolytic capacity was examined in the intact human erythrocyte. Selective alteration of the nicotinamide adenine nucleotide and adenine nucleotide content of erythrocytes was induced by incubation in the presence of appropriate precursors. Variation of the adenine nucleotide content of the cells resulted in proportional changes in glycolytic capacity, indicating that it is a limiting factor. Variation of NAD concentrations, on the other hand, showed little relationship to glycolytic capacity, suggesting the presence of a normal excess of this cofactor in the erythrocyte."

https://openalex.org/W1480879760,"Abstract 1. The murine toxin of Pasteurella pestis inhibits the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-cytochrome c reductase activity of electron transport particles (ETPh) as well as that of the purified complex, and the percentage inhibition is essentially the same with each of these preparations. 2. The NADH-coenzyme Q (CoQ) reductase activity of ETPh particles and the purified complex is likewise inhibited by the toxin. 3. The Amytal-insensitive NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity exhibited by NADH-CoQ reductase is not altered upon the addition of toxin, suggesting that the toxin has no effect on the NADH dehydrogenase activity of this enzyme complex. 4. Difference spectra of toxin-treated NADH-CoQ reductase reveal that the toxin has no effect on the reduction of the flavoprotein moiety of this enzyme complex. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic studies with NADH-CoQ reductase have shown that its nonheme iron content is not modified by the toxin. 5. Plague murine toxin has little or no effect on the reduced CoQ-cytochrome c reductase activity of ETPh particles, whereas the enzymatic activity of the purified complex is inhibited to a significant extent by the toxin."
