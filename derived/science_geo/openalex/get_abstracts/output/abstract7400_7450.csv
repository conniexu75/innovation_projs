https://openalex.org/W1584004556,"An improved method of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis has been developed which produces high resolution, reproducible images suitable for computer analysis. In the images that are presented, more than 800 proteins have been resolved without significant overlap, and many more proteins can be detected after longer exposures. To establish the usefulness of such methods for detailed quantitative comparisons of cultured cells, extensive controls have been carried out to test the reproducibility of the electrophoretic procedures, the sample preparation procedures, and the cell culture conditions. A computerized scanning system has been developed which can automatically detect and integrate the densities of the spots on a two-dimensional fluorogram or autoradiogram. The corresponding proteins from two or more samples can then be matched and their intensities compared. Several types of graphic output have been used to display the number and magnitude of the differences between the compared samples. These methods were used to study the patterns of protein synthesis in the nerve cell line B103 and the glial cell line B9. Both exponentially dividing and stationary cultures were analyzed and the relative rates of synthesis of approximately 300 proteins were compared by computer. For each cell line, no major qualitative differences were found between dividing and stationary phase cells although numerous quantitative differences of up to 15-fold were detected. The proteins that were increased or decreased in rate of synthesis as B103 cells became confluent were in general not the same proteins that were increased or decreased in rate of synthesis as B9 cells reached confluence, indicating that most of the changes do not reflect growth control responses common to all cells. When the two cell lines were analyzed in the same state of growth and compared by computer, qualitative differences were found in approximately 5% of the proteins analyzed, and at least 40% of the shared proteins were involved in quantitative differences of 2-fold or more. The rates of synthesis of the shared proteins were more divergent between the two cell lines than between dividing and stationary phase cells of either line. These studies show, therefore, that these cell lines can be distinguished, regardless of growth state, by their cell-specific proteins and by their characteristic rates of synthesis of many of the shared proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1552275448,"Arachidonic acid was incubated with rabbit peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes (glycogen-induced) and compounds obtained from ether extractions were fractionated by silicic acid column chromatography. A fraction containing several unidentified metabolites of arachidonic acid was analyzed by reversed phase-high pressure liquid chromatography. The metabolites were esterified and further purified by silicic acid high pressure liquid chromatography. The structures of the pure compounds were elucidated by infrared and ultraviolet spectrometry, ozonolysis, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The following novel compounds were identified: Compound 1, 5S, 12R-dihydroxy-(E,E,E,Z)-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid; Compound 2, 5S, 12S-dihydroxy-(E,E,E,Z)-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid; Compound 3, 5, 6-dihydroxy-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid; Compound 4, a diastereoisomer of the latter. Evidence for the occurrence of the delta-lactone forms of the 5,12-dihydroxy acids is also presented."

https://openalex.org/W1538895195,"Leucine, but not isoleucine or valine, inhibited protein degradation and accelerated protein synthesis in hearts perfused with buffer that contained glucose (15 mM) and normal plasma levels of other amino acids, except for the branched chain compounds. Products of leucine, isoleucine, and valine metabolism also inhibited protein degradation and stimulated protein synthesis. These compounds included the transamination and decarboxylation products, as well as acetate, acetoacetate, and propionate. In some, but not all instances, inhibition of degradation and acceleration of synthesis were accompanied by an increase in intracellular leucine. When insulin was added to the perfusate, the rate of degradation was reduced by 40%, but addition of leucine was ineffective in the presence of the hormone. Insulin, leucine (2 mM) and a mixture of branched chain amino acids at normal plasma levels increased latency of cathepsin D in hearts that were perfused with buffer containing glucose. A combination of leucine and insulin increased latency more than either substance alone. These studies indicate that leucine as well as a variety of substrates that are oxidized in the citric acid cycle are involved in regulation of protein turnover in heart muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2124085738,"Highly purified “usual” human serum cholinesterase was studied. The enzyme is a tetramer with a molecular weight of approximately 340,000. Its four subunits appear to be identical. On 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel electrophoresis the enzyme had a molecular weight of about 180,000 when dissolved in 1% SDS, but it had a molecular weight of about 90,000 when dissolved in 1% SDS and 40 mM dithiothreitol. This was evidence that the subunits were arranged as a dimer of dimers ((cw)&, with each (a)~ dimer composed of two identical subunits joined by interchain disulfide bonds. Purified “atypical” cholinesterase had the same dimer of dimers structure and the same molecular weight on SDS-gel electrophoresis as usual cholinesterase. Additional structural experiments were conducted with purified usual choline&erase. The number of interchain disulfide bonds was quantitated by selectively reducing these bonds in the absence of a denaturant, followed by alkylation with [l-‘4C]iodoacetate. One SH per subunit was alkylated. As the enzyme contains no free SH groups, the alkylated residues must previously have been components of disulfide bonds. It was shown that the alkylated -SH groups arose from interchain disulfide bonds, for on SDS-gel electrophoresis of the alkylated enzyme, the labeled product all migrated with the subunit molecular weight of 90,000. It was concluded that each dimer contained only one interchain disulfide bond between two subunits. After reduction and alkylation of the interchain disulfide bonds, the enzyme was still a tetramer and was fully active. Therefore, it was concluded that the interchain disulfides were not necessary for either the tetramerit structure or for activity, and that the four subunits were held together by noncovalent bonds. The interchain disulfide bonds stabilized the enzyme as shown by measurements of rates of heat inactivation. Native enzyme had a half-life of 54 min at 55”C, whereas enzyme that had been selectively reduced and [14C]carboxymethylated, had a half-life of 16 min at 55°C. The interchain disulfide bonds were easily reduced and alkylated, suggesting that these bonds are located near the surface of the molecule. In addition to the single interchain disulfide bond, each subunit contains several (three to five) pairs of intrachain disulfide bonds."

Gangliosides G4 and G7 have been characterized by having 2 leads to 6-linked sialic acid to galactose at their termini. Ganglioside G5 was a positional isomer of a brain ganglioside GM1 as to the linkage of sialic acid. Ganglioside G8 was characterized as a branched chain ganglioside similar to a fucoganglioside previously isolated but devoid of fucose, and it showed a strong blood group I activity. Structures of these four new gangliosides are shown below: (formula: see text)."
https://openalex.org/W10320855,"Two phospholipid exchange proteins from bovine heart have been purified approximately 2000-fold and judged greater than 90% pure. The proteins are similar in molecular weight (both 33,400 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 23,500 by gel filtration), in amino acid composition, and in specificity, although they differ in isoelectric points, 5.3 and 5.6. The transfer of phospholipids between artificial membranes is catalyzed by these proteins at the following relative rates: 100 for phosphatidylinositol, 35 for phosphatidylcholine, 5 for sphingomyelin, and 0.1 for phosphatidylethanolamine. The use of these exchange proteins in the study of mixed phospholipid vesicle structure is demonstrated. The purified proteins catalyze the substitution of one membrane phospholipid species for another at a rate comparable to true exchange. The phospholipid exchange activity is inhibited by the presence of sphingomyelin, and also by reagents which react with sulfhydryl groups. Evidence is presented for two sites of N-ethylmaleimide binding on these exchange proteins. Reaction with one site has little effect on activity and occurs in the absence of membranes. Reaction with the second site occurs in the presence of phospholipid vesicles and leads to complete, irreversible inhibition of exchange activity."

https://openalex.org/W89499173,"The vaccinia virus-induced DNA polymerase has been purified about 500-fold from a cytoplasmic extract of vaccinia-infected HeLa cells. Analysis of the purified fraction by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals a single polypeptide of 110,000 daltons, which is greater than 95% pure. This polypeptide co-sediments with polymerase activity through a glycerol gradient. The sedimentation coefficient of the enzyme is 6.3 S, and its Stokes radius is 4.6 nm. The molecular weight of the native enzyme derived from these values is 115,000. Vaccinia polymerase is therefore a single large polypeptide of 110,000 to 115,000 daltons. The purified fraction has no significant endonuclease activity, but a strong exonuclease activity co-purifies with polymerase activity through every step in the isolation. The polymerase and exonuclease activities are inactivated at 45 degrees C at the same rate. It is likely, therefore, that both activities are catalyzed by the same polypeptide. The exonuclease hydrolyzes DNA predominantly in the 3' leads to 5' direction, to produce 5' mononucleotides. The exonuclease degrades single-stranded DNA more rapidly than duplex DNA, and the rate of digestion of both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA increases as the size of the substrate decreases. Single-stranded circular DNA is a potent inhibitor of the exonuclease activity, but duplex circular DNA has no significant effect on its activity."
https://openalex.org/W1484128443,"A highly homogeneous 145-base-pair fragment of double helical poly(dA-dT) . poly(dA-dT) was obtained by micrococcal nuclease digestion of a semisynthetic chromatin prepared from the nucleosome core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, H4) and the synthetic polydeoxyribonucleotide. In contrast to higher molecular weight alternating copolymers, this fragment displayed two resolved 31P NMR signals, separated by 24 Hz at 10.93 MHz. The two signals were of equal intensity at all temperatures less than the Tm for the fragment. Analyses of the possible origins for the two reasonances leads to the conclusion that the phosphodiester backbone of this DNA contains two distinct phosphorus environments, probably in an alternating array. We suggest that this may indicate the presence of sequence-dependent local variation in the helical structure of DNA in general."
https://openalex.org/W1539638985,"The regulation of pyruvate kinase in isolated hepatocytes from fasted rats was studied where the intracellular level of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was elevated 5-fold by the addition of 5 mM dihydroxyacetone. In this case, flux through pyruvate kinase was increased. The increase in flux correlated with an elevation in fructose bisphosphate levels but not with P-enolpyruvate levels which were unchanged. Pyruvate kinase was activated and its affinity for P-enolpyruvate was increased 7-fold in hepatocyte homogenates. Precipitation of the enzyme from homogenates with ammonium sulfate removed fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and activation was no longer observed. These results indicate that flux through and activity of pyruvate kinase can be controlled by the intracellular level of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The effect of elevated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate levels on the ability of glucagon to inactivate pyruvate kinase was also studied where only covalent enzyme modification is observed. Inactivation by maximally effective hormone concentrations was unaffected by elevated levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, but the half-maximally effective concentration was increased from 0.3 to 0.8 nM. Activation of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase by 0.3 nM glucagon was unaffected, but the initial rate of pyruvate kinase inactivation was suppressed. These results suggest that alterations in the level of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate can affect the ability of physiological concentrations of glucagon to inactivate pyruvate kinase by opposing phosphorylation of the enzyme. Consistent with this view was the finding that physiological concentrations of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate inhibited in vitro phosphorylation of purified pyruvate kinase. Inactivation of pyruvate kinase by 0.3 nM glucagon or 1 microM phenylephrine was also suppressed by 10 nM insulin. Insulin did not act by increasing fructose 1,6-bisphosphate levels. The antagonism to glucagon correlated well with the ability of insulin to suppress activation of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. However, no such correlation was observed with phenylephrine in the absence or presence of insulin. Thus, insulin can enhance pyruvate kinase activity by both cyclic AMP-dependent and independent mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W1044048047,"Two dimensional gel electrophoresis has been used to measure the degree of genetic polymorphism among the proteins of normal human fibroblasts. Autoradiographic analysis of the gel protein profiles from radioactively labeled cells allowed comparison of as many as 300 discrete polypeptides at a time. In addition, a newly developed technique for double label autoradiography was used to increase the sensitivity of the system for detection of small differences in the protein profiles of different cell lines. Only about 1.2% of the proteins of different cell lines were found to differ in their electrophoretic mobility. This corresponds to an average heterozygosity of approximately 0.6%. Previous studies of genetic polymorphism using different methods of one-dimensional electrophoretic analysis have estimated the average heterozygosity of the human population at about 6.7%. Detailed mathematical analysis shows the variation of the observed from the expected number of differences to be statistically highly significant. While the reasons for this difference are not clear, the observation of low levels of genetic polymorphism on two-dimensional gels should enhance the usefulness of this technique for detection of altered proteins in inherited disease."
https://openalex.org/W1594575060,"Explants of 19- to 20-day fetal rat liver synthesize polypeptides biochemically and immunologically related to the well characterized somatomedin (insulin-like growth factor) BRL-MSA, multiplication-stimulating activity. Fetal MSA was purified from media conditioned by fetal liver explants by chromatography on Sephadex G-75 under acid conditions. Partially purified fetal MSA: 1) inhibited the binding of BRL-MSA to the MSA receptor of rat liver plasma membranes, to somatomedin-binding proteins from rat serum, and to rabbit anti-BRL-MSA serum; 2) had a molecular weight of 4,500 to 12,500 determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate; 3) stimulated the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the DNA of chick embryo fibroblasts and induced cell multiplication; 4) stimulated glucose oxidation in rat adipocytes and weakly inhibited the binding of insulin to the insulin receptors of IM-9 lymphocytes; and 5) stimulated sulfate uptake in costal cartilage from hypophysectomized rats. These activities were associated with the same molecular species in fetal MSA preparations following disc acrylamide electrophoresis and co-migrated with active BRL-MSA peptides."

https://openalex.org/W2169605947,"Uteroferrin, a purple-colored, iron-containing glycoprotein, purified from the uterine fluid of progesterone-stimulated pigs, owes its natural purple color to a broad absorption band centered at 545 nm. Laser excitation within the visible absorption band of uteroferrin results in an intense resonance Raman spectrum which bears a striking resemblance to that reported for Fe(III)-transferrin, the iron transport protein of serum. Excitation profiles for the four resonance-enhanced bands of uteroferrin were obtained from 4579 A to 6741 A, using lines from Ar+ and Kr+ lasers. Each of the profiles have maxima near 545 nm. The spectral similarities of uteroferrin and Fe(III)-transferrin lead to the belief that the Fe(III) binding sites of the two proteins must be, at least in some respects, quite similar. In particular, it is concluded that, as in Fe(III)-transferrin, the metal binding site of uteroferrin contains a tyrosine ligand and that the visible absorption spectrum of uteroferrin results from a phenolate to Fe(III) charge transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1661602970,"Human fibroblastoid interferon produced from an established human cell line was purified by controlled-pore glass and concanavalin A-Sepharose column chromatography followed by preparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The purification procedure provided a 10% recovery of pure interferon with good reproducibility. The purified protein was homogeneous with respect to its molecular weight of 20,000 and net electrical charge at pH 2.5. Interferon of high specific activity of 5 x 10(8) units/mg of protein was directly demonstrated in the polyacrylamide gel before staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. Parallel purification of a sham-induced interferon preparation did not yield an equivalent product indicating the purified interferon is not derived from uninduced cells or from the fetal calf serum of the tissue culture growth medium. Pure interferon was radioiodinated by Bolton-Hunter reagent. Amino acid analysis of the pure preparation shows interferon to be a leucine-rich glycoprotein containing a high percentage of glutamic/glutamine residues and that disulfide bridges(s) are important for its biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1665170788,"The effect of media conditions on the glucocorticoid response has been examined in three types of cultured cells. In rat pituitary tumor cells (GC cells) growth hormone production was stimulated by glucocorticoids provided fresh culture media was present (enriched media conditions). In contrast, dexamethasone either failed to induce or deinduce growth hormone synthesis if added to cultures which had not received fresh media for 3 days (depleted media condition). With human skin fibroblasts, cortisol stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in the enriched condition but inhibited this response in the depleted condition. In mouse lymphoma (S49) cells the enriched media conditions significantly delayed the killing response to glucocorticoids (20% killing after 24 h versus 90% killing after 24 h for the depleted condition). Thus, the magnitude and in some cases, the direction of the glucocorticoid response are sensitive to the conditions to which the cells are exposed. In all three cell types the steroid also rapidly (detectable by 15 min, maximal by 2 h) altered chromatin structure as detected by a change in the number of initiation sites for Escherichia coli RNA polymerase assayed under cell-free conditions. This early nuclear response could be in a positive or negative direction and was also affected by the culture conditions; enriched media favored a positive or less negative effect on the initiation sites by the steroid, while depleted media favored a steroid-induced inhibition of this chromatin function. In S49 and GC cells the kinetics and magnitude of the change in chromatin closely followed receptor . glucocorticoid complex binding to nuclei while removal of dexamethasone from the culture media resulted in a rapid (t 1/2 = approximately 20 min) disappearance of the effect which paralleled loss of bound hormone from the nucleus. The glucocorticoid effect on chromatin was not observed in two lines of glucocorticoid-resistant mutant S49 cells. One line (R-) lacks detectable glucocorticoid receptors; the other line (Nti) has receptors that bind the hormone normally, but the receptor . glucocorticoid complexes bind more avidly to the nucleus. These results suggest that the receptor is involved in both the stimulatory and the inhibitory effects on chromatin. The findings in the Nti cells and of a slight lag between nuclear binding of receptors and initiation site alteration implies that some receptor property, in addition to nuclear binding per se, is responsible for the influence on chromatin. These results are discussed in terms of a model in which steroid hormones initiate their actions by influencing a reaction that modifies chromatin structure. The direction and magnitude of the reaction, and its effect on the expression of specific genes, are dictated by the metabolic state and differentiation of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1534902668,"A high molecular weight (greater than 400,000) protease active with [3H]leucine-labeled globin has been found in the postmicrosomal fraction of mouse kidney, brain, heart, spleen, and tumor cells and is most active in liver. The presence in liver was unexpected because liver cytosol is very ineffective in the breakdown of endogenous, labeled proteins. The enzyme has a number of properties that distinguish it from known cathepsins in addition to its high molecular weight. It is most active at pH approximately 7.5. When purified, it is unstable above 20 degrees C and is stabilized by metal chelating agents such as citrate, creatine-P, and glycerate-3-P. It is an -SH protease, but its thermal instability is not affected by 1 mM dithiothreitol. The enzyme is not lysosomal."
https://openalex.org/W1770317606,"Insulin binding to its cellular receptors is markedly dependent on the temperature. The thermodynamic parameters for the reaction of insulin with the high affinity state of its receptor have been evaluated with equilibrium studies at multiple temperatures between 5 degrees and 37 degrees C. The thermodynamics of the insulin-receptor interaction is not classical. The van't Hoff plot is not linear. Both the enthalpy and entropy changes, due to the formation of the hormone . receptor complex, decrease markedly with temperature, corresponding to a large heat capacity change of -766 cal/(mol deg) at 25 degrees C. The reaction is endothermic and entropically driven at low temperature and exothermic and enthalpically driven at higher temperature. This thermodynamic behavior is suggestive of a hydrophobic reaction and supports Blundell's concept that the loss of non-polar surface residues in the formation of the hormone . receptor complex is an important driving force of the reaction. Alternatively, this nonclassical behavior may indicate that the reaction of insulin with its receptor involves more than one step."
https://openalex.org/W1535994913,"The preparation of three hemoglobin tetramers containing the hemoglobin S mutation at beta 6 and an additional one at alpha 6, alpha 47, and alpha 75 is described. The effect of the substitutions in the alpha chains on polymerization was investigated by the equilibrium solubility of the gels as well as the abrupt change in oxygen affinity associated with the onset of gelation. Substitution of a histidine for aspartic acid at alpha 47 causes a marked inhibition of polymerization. This inhibition probably results from tetramers which carry the two substitutions on the same alpha beta dimer. By contrast, the introduction of a tyrosine at alpha 75 and an alanine at alpha 6 have the opposite effect and are the first examples of alpha chain mutations which potentiate the gelation of Hb S. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of the mutations on the self-association of Hb S are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1594383166,"The function of eukaryotic initiation factor 5 (eIF-5) from rabbit reticulocyte lysate has been studied by sucrose gradient preparation of 40 S and 80 S initiation complexes. eIF-5 is required for transfer of initiator tRNA from 40 S preinitiation complexes to puromycin-reactive 80 S complexes. The transfer is dependent upon GTP hydrolysis and is associated with release of eIF-2 and eIF-3 from the 40 S subunit. The GTP-dependent loss of eIF-2 and eIF-3 is catalyzed by eIF-5 in the absence of 60 S subunits or when subunit joining is prevented by edeine, but not when GTP is replaced by GuoPP(NH)P. Unstable 40 S subunit . Met-tRNAf complexes generated by eIF-5 can form puromycin-reactive 80 S complexes when 60 S subunits are added in the absence of added GTP. In addition, kinetic evidence is presented that indicates GTP hydrolysis occurs prior to 80 S complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W138730747,"Neuroblastoma polysomal mRNAs have been fractionated by a combination of oligo(dT)-cellulose and Millipore filter techniques into four classes, each containing a different average length of poly(A). These classes are present in mRNAs isolated using different extraction techniques and they probably represent the steady state mRNA distribution in neuroblastoma cells. Quantitation of the biological activity of each fraction in a wheat germ translation system shows that 32% of the mRNAs contain no oligo(A)s longer than 6; 4% have poly(A)s between 6 and 20 nucleotides, 22% have between 20 and 50 nucleotides, and 42% have greater than 50 nucleotides. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the proteins synthesized by the unfractionated and fractionated mRNAs showed there was no mRNA degradation during the fractionation procedures. Analysis of the most abundant peptides synthesized by each RNA fraction shows that most mRNAs are found in each of the four populations. However, the distribution of some individual mRNAs varies widely. The (Yand fi-tubulin mRNAs are examples of those which are more abundant in the population with long poly(A)s. In contrast, a significant proportion of the mRNAs coding for actin and the R1 and RB CAMP-binding proteins are nonadenylated. The histone mRNAs are unique in that they are more abundant in the nonadenylated mRNAs than in the mRNAs containing short stretches of poly(A). These results are consistent with a model wherein the poly(A) termini in some mRNA species are more rapidly cleaved than in others."

https://openalex.org/W1542257228,"Mouse liver aldolase was used as a model to investigate the biochemical basis for the production of “defective” proteins in aging systems. Evidence is given that the defective liver aldolase molecules, originally reported by Gershon and Gershon (Gershon, H., and Gershon, D. (1973) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 70, 9099X), are produced during storage of “old” samples rather than being produced in old liver cells in vivo. This interpretation is based on the findings that: 1) although aldolase activity in liver extracts of old (30 months) mice was inactivated to 60% of the initial value during storage, this inactivation could be completely eliminated by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and leupeptin during tissue homogenization to inhibit proteolysis; and 2) the specific catalytic activities of liver aldolase isolated from old and young (3 months) mice by affinity chromatography on phosphocellulose columns were essentially identical (about 5 units/mg) provided that the proteolytic inhibitors were present during enzyme isolation. Defective and nondefective aldolase molecules were immunologically identical, exhibited the same fructose-Pz/fructose-1-P activity ratios (1.0 to 1.2), and were not resolved on the basis of charge or subunit molecular weight nor by their abilities to be isolated by affinity chromatography. However, the defective aldolase molecules were found to lack COOH-terminal tyrosine residues which are present on nondefective molecules. This defect appears to be responsible for the reduced catalytic activity of defective aldolase molecules. The aldolase activity levels of freshly prepared extracts of old and young mouse livers were found to be essentially identical and the relative rates of synthesis of aldolase in liver cells of 3and 30-month-old mice were found to be very similar, as determined in short term double isotope incorporation experiments conducted with tissue minces in culture. We suggest that the defective aldolase molecules observed in extracts of old mouse liver are not produced by bonafide age-related changes in the fidelity of protein synthesis or postsynthetic modifications occurring in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1576425120,"Tl+ ions have been shown to mimic or compete with K+ in a number of membrane systems. We confirmed that in starved, valinomycin-treated cells of Streptococcus lactis 7962, Tl+ ions distributed themselves across the bacterial membrane in response to the potassium diffusion potential. In glucose-energized cells, however, Tl+ was taken up by a system specifically stimulated by sodium salts. The intracellular levels of Tl+ exceeded those attained by [3H]triphenylmethylphosphonium ion, a lipophilic cation which accumulates in response to the membrane potential. The uptake of Tl+ by (Na+ and glucose)-stimulated cells was strongly inhibited by potassium salts. These experiments suggest that metabolic energy is coupled to Tl+ transport by means of a high energy phosphate compound and that Tl+ ions are actively transported by a membrane carrier whose normal substrate is K+. The uptake of Tl+ is not a valid method for determining the streptococcal membrane potential."

The antigens were solubilized by a limited papain digestion of a crude preparation of liver membranes (strain A/J) and purified by ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, affinity chromatography, and isoelectric focusing. The overall degree of purification of H-2Kk was 1,300-fold and that of H-2Dd was 1,500-fold; approximately 8 mg of purified H-2a antigens were obtained from 1 kg of liver. The purification was followed by a sensitive radioimmunoassay in which H-2a-containing fractions were used to inhibit the binding of 125I-labeled H-2a to appropriate antisera. H-2Dd and H-2Kk co-purified through all the steps but the concentration of H-2Kk was 2- to 3-fold higher than that of H-2Dd in the liver homogenate as well as in the purified H-2 preparation. beta 2-microglobulin was initially present in a 3- to 10-fold excess over H-2 in the liver homogenate, but the purified H-2 preparation contained approximately 2 mol of alloantigenic heavy chain/mol of beta 2-microglobulin. Isoelectric focusing and disc-gel electrophoresis showed a charge heterogeneity of H-2, with a mean isoelectric point of pH 4.9. Electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels showed one band. Denaturing conditions were required to remove beta 2-microglobulin and small amounts of impurities from H-2. The amino acid sequence of the first 27 residues of the isolated heavy chains was determined."
https://openalex.org/W1625092173,"Almost all cells contain actin, which in its polymerized form, F-actin, binds 1 molecule of ADP/monomer. Little is known about the availability to metabolism of this bound ADP. A comparison was therefore made between perchloric acid and EDTA/ethanol extracts of human blood platelets. When the cells were extracted under conditions where the ATPase activity was negligible, the ethanol extracts had a 75% higher ATP/ADP ratio and a higher adenylate energy charge than perchloric acid extracts. The methods differed in that a considerable portion of protein-bound ADP was not extracted by ethanol. This bound ADP behaved as though it were unavailable to energy metabolism and should thus be considered as a compartment separate from the bulk metabolic pool of extragranular platelet adenine nucleotides. These results suggest that the level of ADP obtained with the common acid extraction overestimates the level available to participation in metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1025574602,"The phospholipids in rat brain microsomes were labeled with tritium by intracerebral administration of radioactive fatty acids and converted to diacylglycerol with phospholipase C. The latter lipid was hydrolyzed in situ at pH 4.8, to monoacylglycerol and fatty acid by the endogenous microsomal lipase. This paper provides an experimental approach to determine whether the lipid was degraded by enzyme molecules residing in its own membrane (intramembrane interaction) or an adjacent membrane (intermembrane interaction). Direct interaction between separate membranes containing enzyme or substrate showed the existence of the inter-membrane route while dilution experiments provided evidence for the presence of the intramembrane interaction as well. A probable difference in the mechanisms of these two interactions is suggested by different shapes of the curves that describe the reaction rate as a function of the endogenous substrate. The curve resulting from the intermembrane interaction was hyperbolic while that representing the intramembrane route was of a parabola-like shape. Competition experiments suggested that when given a choice between the two, the enzyme utilized preferentially the substrate molecules in its own membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1502150029,"Bovine erythrocytes, which are not concanavalin A (ConA)-agglutinable, can be rendered so by attaching alpha-D-mannose residues to their outer membrane. The sugars are incorporated by mildly oxidizing the cells with periodate followed by coupling the liberated aldehyde groups with an alpha-thiomannosyl containing hydrazide (I). The rate and extent of ConA-mediated aggregation of the modified cells are not linearly dependent on the amount of sugar incorporated. For example, treatment of the erythrocytes with 0.075 mM periodate for 5 min followed by I led to the introduction of 1.05 x 10(6) mannosyl residues/erythrocyte. Binding studies with 125I-ConA demonstrated the presence of 66,525 ConA receptors/cell with an average KA = 4.9 X 10(6) M-1 yet the cells failed to aggregate with ConA at concentrations up to 500 microgram ml-1. Treating the cells with 0.1 mM periodate followed by I led to the introduction of 1.42 x 10(6) mannosyl residues/erythrocyte. Binding studies with 125I-ConA indicated the presence of 78,780 binding sites/cell (KA = 5.9 X 10(6) M-1). These cells were readily aggregated by ConA at concentrations greater than or equal to 64 microgram ml-1. We show here that the sugar incorporation technique is random and that no functional differences were detected in the receptors introduced at the different periodate concentrations. Therefore, the ConA-mediated aggregation of these modified erythrocytes is exquisitely sensitive to small changes in functionally identical receptor densities."
https://openalex.org/W1589934975,"Kinetic studies of phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase (EC 2.7.5.2) for the following reactions: 1) Glc-1-P in equilibrium Glc-6-P and 2) GlcNAc-1-P in equilibrium GlcNAc-6-P have been conducted in the presence of Glc-1,6-P2 and GlcNAc-1,6-P2, respectively. In the first reaction, the initial velocity studies at various concentrations of one substrate showed a series of parallel lines in the Line-weaver-Burk plot when the concentrations of the other substrate were changed at several fixed levels. For both reactions, the initial velocity studies performed at fixed ratios of both substrates showed linear lines in the double reciprocal plot. The competitive substrate inhibition pattern was observed in the second reaction. A ping-pong mechanism is proposed for phosphoacetyl-glucosamine mutase. In addition, phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase can be phosphorylated by the addition of Glc-1-[32P]P probably via the reaction of Glc-1-[32P]P with the phosphoenzyme followed by the release of glucose-monophosphate leaving the 32P with the phosphoenzyme. The linkage between the phosphoryl residue and enzyme is stable in acid, but labile in alkali, suggesting phosphoserine (or phosphothreonine) as the phosphorylated amino acid. Biphasic heat denaturation curves suggest the existence of heat-stable and heat-labile forms of this enzyme."

Virus-associated RNA polymerase activity was lost following psoralen photoreaction, consistent with dependence on the genome RNA as template for viral mRNA synthesis. By contrast, reovirus guanylyl transferase and methyl transferase activities that catalyze the formation of mRNA 5'-terminal cap, m GpppG, were relatively unaffected by photoreaction. Cations that inhibit psoralen binding to nucleic acids also protected against loss of RNA polymerase activity. Partially photoinactivated viral cores produced decreased amounts of full length viral mRNAs. The absence of prematurely terminated transcripts indicates that template RNA modification by psoralen adducts has an all-or-none effect on initiation of mRNA synthesis by the core-associated RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1504561882,"The NADPH-dependent enoyl coenzyme A reductase activity of bovine mammary fatty acid synthetase has been characterized with regard to substrate specificity and the product formed. A relatively high specificity for an unsubstituted, four-carbon, 2,3-enoyl chain in trans configuration is obtained. Reduction of trans-crotonyl-CoA results in butyrate, 50% of which is coenzyme A-bound. The reaction is subject to product inhibition, specifically by butyryl-CoA and NADP. Free coenzyme A, on the other hand, is an activator. The pH profile, susceptibility to inhibition by -SH reagents, the results of the relative activities obtained with substrate analogues and homologues, and the ready use of crotonyl-CoA as a primer in fatty acid synthesis are consistent with a mechanism in which the crotonyl group is transferred to an -SH group, is reduced, and then is either transferred back to CoA or hydrolyzed."

https://openalex.org/W1562386323,"The reaction kinetics of fully oxidized flavodoxin from Clostridium MP with the hydrated electron have been investigated by the pulse radiolysis method. Four spectrally distinct processes have been observed with the ultimate formation of the singly reduced flavin form of the protein. The last two species obtained in the reaction sequence are spectrally similar, and are connected through a reaction which is first order. It is proposed that this reaction involves a protein conformational alteration."
https://openalex.org/W1579946445,"The discrepancy in the rate of [14C]O2 formation from either [1-14C]- or [16-14C]palmitate is demonstrated and could be explained by the preferential formation of L-(+)-3-hydroxybutyrate from the four carbon atoms at the omega terminus. The identity of this product as L(+)-3-hydroxybutyrate was established and shown to be the major component of the radioactive products in the extracellular medium from palmitate based on (a) ion-exchange chromatographical properties, (b) gas-liquid chromatography, (c) mass spectrometric analysis, (d) stereoisomeric separation, and (e) its very low rate of utilization by the cells. We therefore propose a shunt to the oxidation of palmitate in these cells occurring at the stage of L(+)-hydroxybutyryl-CoA which undergoes deacylation causing the product to be transported outside the cell."
https://openalex.org/W93180239,"Ethidium bromide has been reported to extract estrogen receptors from uterine nuclei whereas actinomycin D appears to block nuclear receptor “processing” in MCF-7 cells. We have examined the effect of these drugs on the nuclear estrogen receptor during the [3H]estradiol exchange assay. Uterine nuclear fractions were prepared from ovariectomized rats that had received a 5-pg subcutaneous injection of e&radio1 1 h prior to killing. Incubation of nuclear fractions with [3H]estradiol at 37°C resulted in a rapid labeling of nuclear estrogen receptor within 30 min which was followed by a loss of receptor sites that qualitatively resembled nuclear estrogen receptor processing. The addition of actinomycin D or ethidium bromide blocked this loss of nuclear estrogen receptor, resulting in a prolonged elevation of specific nuclear [3H]estradiol binding. Examination of the DNA by polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis showed extensive fragmentation that could be inhibited by actinomycin D in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that a nuclease(s) present in crude nuclear fractions was responsible for the DNA fragmentation and loss of nuclear estrogen receptor complexes. Nuclear estrogen receptor release and DNA hydrolysis did not occur in highly purified nuclei. Nuclear estrogen receptor lost at 37°C could be recovered in the supernatant fraction as a family of soluble macromolecular complexes. Low salt sucrose gradients of this fraction showed specifically bound [3H]estradiol in an aggregate fraction that sedimented to the bottom of the gradient, and a free 8 S form. Both of these were converted to a 6 S form in gradients containing 0.4"
https://openalex.org/W2417938441,"A simple method for selection of RNA-DNA hybrids has been developed and applied to the purification of adenovirus-specific messenger RNA. Cytoplasmic RNA prepared from adenovirus type 2 (ad2)-infected HeLa cells or from an ad2-transformed rat cell line was hybridized in solution to the complementary strands of ad2 DNA. The hybridization mixture was subsequently fractionated by chromatography on a Sepharose 2B column. The intact probe DNA as well as the RNA-DNA hybrids are excluded from the gel matrix and elute with the void volume. Nonhybridized RNA, in contrast, is included into the gel matrix and elutes as a broad peak well separated from the excluded fractions. Fractions corresponding to the void volume, were collected and the RNA-DNA hybrids were denatured in 90% formamide. The selected RNA was separated from the DNA by affinity chromatography on poly(U)-Sepharose. Restriction endonuclease fragments of DNA with a large enough size to make them excluded from the agarose column were also used for hybridization. In these experiments hybridizations were carried out under conditions which would allow R-loop formation (Thomas, M., White, R.L., and Davis, R.W. (1976) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 73, 2294-2298) and the hybridized RNA was separated from unhybridized RNA by Sepharose chromatography. The validity of the method was demonstrated by programming an in vitro protein-synthesizing system with selected RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1494697423,"The conformational state of histones in isolated chicken erythrocyte chromatin was studied using procedures developed for probing surface proteins on membranes. Under controlled conditions, only exposed tyrosyl residues react with iodide radicals, generated either by the oxidant, chloramine-T (paratoluenesulfonyl chloramide), or the enzyme lactoperoxidase, giving monoidotyrosine. Using 125-iodine, this study compared the reactive tyrosines in free and bound histones H4, and H5. The relative extent of iodination of these histones within (H4) and outside (H5) of the nucleosomes was measured after extraction and gel electrophoresis. Each of the histones was further analyzed for the extent of specific tyrosine iodination by separating the tryptic peptides by high voltage electrophoresis. The identity of the labeled peptide was determined by dansylation of the amino acids present in each hydrolyzed peptide. The results show that there is a difference in the conformational arrangement of these histones on chromatin and in the free forms, since in chromatin not all tyrosine residues are as accessible for iodination as in the denatured state. Residue 53 of histone H5 for instance is more reactive than residues 28 and 58, indicating that the segments containing the latter residues are involved in either protein-DNA or protein-protein interactions. In histone H4, preferential labeling of 2 of the 4 tyrosines present was also observed."
