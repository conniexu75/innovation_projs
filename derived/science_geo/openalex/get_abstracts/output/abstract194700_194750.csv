Moreover, antigens characteristic of the recipient do not appear upon the transfused cells. These statements have been shown to be true for the ABO, MNS, Rh, Lutheran, Kell, Duffy and Kidd antigens; but the Lewis antigens have not previously been investigated in this respect."

These compounds appear to be thiol esters, and their properties indicate that they are intermediates in the catalytic activity of the enzyme: they undergo hydrolysis and arsenolysis in the presence of DPN and are reduced by DPNH to form aldehydes. These results are in agreement with the mechanism previously proposed for the oxidation of aldehydes in which a thiol ester formed on the enzyme, with concomitant reduction of DPN, is split in the presence of phosphate to acyl phosphate and regenerated enzyme."

Sodium concentration varies inversely with potassium concentration, and determination of the latter allows the two types to be distinguished. These two types have been called ‘high potassium’ (HK) and ‘low potassium’ (LK). A large number of repeated examinations of many sheep have been carried out, and in no case has the electrolyte type of any sheep changed from HK to LK or vice versa."

https://openalex.org/W2003861743,"CLASSIFICATION of strains of staphylococci by their reactions to bacteriophages has been extensively used in epidemiological studies of staphylococcal infection. Thus three main groups of these organisms can be separated, and strains belonging to different groups have been considered to be unrelated. For example, a patient who is infected with a strain of one group, when later found to be infected with a strain belonging to another group, is regarded as having suffered a second infection from a different source."

https://openalex.org/W2043217102,"THE technique of cutting ultra-thin sections for electron microscopy has made it possible to follow the behaviour of certain viruses in the cell, and this is particularly true of the nuclear virus diseases of insects. The present note describes the remarkable behaviour in the nucleus of the polyhedral virus which causes a blood disease in the larva of the fly, Tipula paludosa
1. Sections through blood cells in the early stages of infection show an apparent condensation of the chromatic material in the centre of the nucleus in which the virus rods can be seen developing (Fig. 1). Most of the virus rods at this stage are concentrated in the centre though some occur scattered throughout the nucleus. The virus rods are never observed on the outer side of the nuclear membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1984815777,"WHEN semen is diluted with a solution of formaldehyde under certain standard conditions of pH, temperature and osmotic pressure, dead spermatozoa are agglutinated but living ones are not. This difference between live and dead spermatozoa has been investigated in 103 ejaculates from seven bulls at a commercial insemination centre. Samples from a hundred of these ejaculates were used for insemination, three ejaculates being unsuitable for insemination because of low sperm motility."

https://openalex.org/W4240597550,"WHILE studying the antibacterial products of a species of Streptomyces (N.C.I.B. 8697) sent by Dr. R. Green from Malaya, we have isolated an orange-red coloured basic substance which is very active against a variety of bacteria and is highly toxic to mice. The antibiotic was extracted from the culture fluid into chloroform, at pH 6, and re-extracted into water at pH 2, or extracted into trichloroethylene, at pH 8.5, and re-extracted into water at pH 3.5. It was purified by counter-current distribution in a solvent system consisting of trichloroethylene and 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer, pH. 5.95. In this system its partition coefficient, K (= concentration in trichloroethylene/concentration in water), was 0.98. The purified product yielded a crystalline hydrochloride, reineckate and picrate. The behaviour of this antibiotic suggests that it is identical with, or very closely related to, xanthomycin A—a substance which has been isolated from species of Streptomyces 1, and stated to have quinonoid properties2. We wish to record, however, that it is a stronger base than xanthomycin A has been reported to be and that it yields two simple bases on hydrolysis which have not been described as degradation products of xanthomycin A."

https://openalex.org/W2080372984,"IN the course of research on digestion in Cardium edule, Mr. G. Owen, of this Department, noticed structures, which he termed ‘spicules’, occurring in the epithelia of the ducts of the digestive diverticula, stomach and midgut. I believe these ‘spicules’ to be a stage in the life-cycle of a coccidiomorph sporozoan, but can find no account of them in the literature. The following description of them is offered in the hope that if they have already been described I will receive notice of it."
