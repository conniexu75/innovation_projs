https://openalex.org/W2026345779,"The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas belongs to one of the most species-rich but genomically poorly explored phyla, the Mollusca. Here we report the sequencing and assembly of the oyster genome using short reads and a fosmid-pooling strategy, along with transcriptomes of development and stress response and the proteome of the shell. The oyster genome is highly polymorphic and rich in repetitive sequences, with some transposable elements still actively shaping variation. Transcriptome studies reveal an extensive set of genes responding to environmental stress. The expansion of genes coding for heat shock protein 70 and inhibitors of apoptosis is probably central to the oyster's adaptation to sessile life in the highly stressful intertidal zone. Our analyses also show that shell formation in molluscs is more complex than currently understood and involves extensive participation of cells and their exosomes. The oyster genome sequence fills a void in our understanding of the Lophotrochozoa."
https://openalex.org/W1985342343,"A single atom is the prototypical quantum system, and a natural candidate for a quantum bit - the elementary unit of a quantum computer. Atoms have been successfully used to store and process quantum information in electromagnetic traps, as well as in diamond through the use of the NV-center point defect. Solid state electrical devices possess great potential to scale up such demonstrations from few-qubit control to larger scale quantum processors. In this direction, coherent control of spin qubits has been achieved in lithographically-defined double quantum dots in both GaAs and Si. However, it is a formidable challenge to combine the electrical measurement capabilities of engineered nanostructures with the benefits inherent to atomic spin qubits. Here we demonstrate the coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin qubit bound to a phosphorus donor atom in natural silicon, measured electrically via single-shot readout. We use electron spin resonance to drive Rabi oscillations, while a Hahn echo pulse sequence reveals a spin coherence time (T2) exceeding 200 \mu s. This figure is expected to become even longer in isotopically enriched 28Si samples. Together with the use of a device architecture that is compatible with modern integrated circuit technology, these results indicate that the electron spin of a single phosphorus atom in silicon is an excellent platform on which to build a scalable quantum computer."
https://openalex.org/W2012980277,"Evolutionary novelties have been important in the history of life, but their origins are usually difficult to examine in detail. We previously described the evolution of a novel trait, aerobic citrate utilization (Cit(+)), in an experimental population of Escherichia coli. Here we analyse genome sequences to investigate the history and genetic basis of this trait. At least three distinct clades coexisted for more than 10,000 generations before its emergence. The Cit(+) trait originated in one clade by a tandem duplication that captured an aerobically expressed promoter for the expression of a previously silent citrate transporter. The clades varied in their propensity to evolve this novel trait, although genotypes able to do so existed in all three clades, implying that multiple potentiating mutations arose during the population's history. Our findings illustrate the importance of promoter capture and altered gene regulation in mediating the exaptation events that often underlie evolutionary innovations."
https://openalex.org/W2001042507,"The pleiotropic transcription factor IRF4 is shown to regulate CD4+ T-cell differentiation and TH17 function through cooperative binding interactions with BATF and JUN family proteins via AP1–IRF4 composite elements (AICEs). Kenneth Murphy and colleagues study the roles of the AP-1 transcription factor BATF in dendritic-cell differentiation — a process that primes CD8+ T-cell responses to intracellular pathogens — and provide evidence for molecular compensation by related family members. Compensation is based on the interaction of the BATF leucine-zipper domains with the interferon regulatory factors IRF4 and IRF8 to mediate cooperative gene activation. In a complementary study, Warren Leonard and colleagues provide evidence that IRF4 regulates CD4+ T-cell differentiation and TH17 function by cooperative binding interactions with the AP-1 family members BATF and JUN. These studies point to potential new targets for manipulating key immune responses that depend on BATF–IRF4 interactions. Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is an IRF family transcription factor with critical roles in lymphoid development and in regulating the immune response1,2. IRF4 binds DNA weakly owing to a carboxy-terminal auto-inhibitory domain, but cooperative binding with factors such as PU.1 or SPIB in B cells increases binding affinity3, allowing IRF4 to regulate genes containing ETS–IRF composite elements (EICEs; 5′-GGAAnnGAAA-3′)1. Here we show that in mouse CD4+ T cells, where PU.1/SPIB expression is low, and in B cells, where PU.1 is well expressed, IRF4 unexpectedly can cooperate with activator protein-1 (AP1) complexes to bind to AP1–IRF4 composite (5′-TGAnTCA/GAAA-3′) motifs that we denote as AP1–IRF composite elements (AICEs). Moreover, BATF–JUN family protein complexes cooperate with IRF4 in binding to AICEs in pre-activated CD4+ T cells stimulated with IL-21 and in TH17 differentiated cells. Importantly, BATF binding was diminished in Irf4−/− T cells and IRF4 binding was diminished in Batf−/− T cells, consistent with functional cooperation between these factors. Moreover, we show that AP1 and IRF complexes cooperatively promote transcription of the Il10 gene, which is expressed in TH17 cells and potently regulated by IL-21. These findings reveal that IRF4 can signal via complexes containing ETS or AP1 motifs depending on the cellular context, thus indicating new approaches for modulating IRF4-dependent transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1968458512,"The AP1 transcription factor Batf3 is required for homeostatic development of CD8α(+) classical dendritic cells that prime CD8 T-cell responses against intracellular pathogens. Here we identify an alternative, Batf3-independent pathway in mice for CD8α(+) dendritic cell development operating during infection with intracellular pathogens and mediated by the cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon-γ. This alternative pathway results from molecular compensation for Batf3 provided by the related AP1 factors Batf, which also functions in T and B cells, and Batf2 induced by cytokines in response to infection. Reciprocally, physiological compensation between Batf and Batf3 also occurs in T cells for expression of IL-10 and CTLA4. Compensation among BATF factors is based on the shared capacity of their leucine zipper domains to interact with non-AP1 factors such as IRF4 and IRF8 to mediate cooperative gene activation. Conceivably, manipulating this alternative pathway of dendritic cell development could be of value in augmenting immune responses to vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2003973869,"The neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) acts in the nucleus accumbens of mice to increase dopamine release through coactivation of CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) and CRFR2, but exposure to severe stress results in loss of this regulation and a switch in the reaction to CRF from appetitive to aversive. Severe stress can exacerbate major depression, characterized by a shift from engagement with the environment to withdrawal. Paul Phillips and colleagues now identify a cellular mechanism involved in this shift. Using a mouse model, they find that corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), a stress-response-related neuropeptide, increases dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, but that this regulation is lost after exposure to acute stress. Animals also show opposing responses to CRF application before and after stress. The authors suggest that severe stress switches the emotional response to stressful stimuli, and that this may be central to stress-induced depressive disorders. Stressors motivate an array of adaptive responses ranging from ‘fight or flight’ to an internal urgency signal facilitating long-term goals1. However, traumatic or chronic uncontrollable stress promotes the onset of major depressive disorder, in which acute stressors lose their motivational properties and are perceived as insurmountable impediments2. Consequently, stress-induced depression is a debilitating human condition characterized by an affective shift from engagement of the environment to withdrawal3. An emerging neurobiological substrate of depression and associated pathology is the nucleus accumbens, a region with the capacity to mediate a diverse range of stress responses by interfacing limbic, cognitive and motor circuitry4. Here we report that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a neuropeptide released in response to acute stressors5 and other arousing environmental stimuli6, acts in the nucleus accumbens of naive mice to increase dopamine release through coactivation of the receptors CRFR1 and CRFR2. Remarkably, severe-stress exposure completely abolished this effect without recovery for at least 90 days. This loss of CRF’s capacity to regulate dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens is accompanied by a switch in the reaction to CRF from appetitive to aversive, indicating a diametric change in the emotional response to acute stressors. Thus, the current findings offer a biological substrate for the switch in affect which is central to stress-induced depressive disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2047667443,"Autophagy plays a critical role in cell survival from prolonged starvation and recycling of aggregated proteins and damaged organelles. One of the essential genes involved in the autophagic initiation is autophagy-related 14 (Atg14), also called Barkor for Beclin 1-associated autophagy-related key regulator. Although its crucial role in the autophagic process has been reported, the gene regulation of Atg14 and its metabolic functions remain unclear. In this work we have identified that the Atg14 gene is regulated by forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors and circadian rhythms in the mouse liver. Luciferase reporter analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have revealed well conserved cis-elements for FoxOs and Clock/Bmal1 in the proximal promoter of the Atg14 gene. To examine the functions of hepatic Atg14, we have performed the gene knockdown and overexpression in the mouse livers. Remarkably, knockdown of Atg14 leads to elevated levels of triglycerides in the liver and serum as well. Conversely, overexpression of Atg14 improves hypertriglyceridemia in both high fat diet-treated wild-type mice and FoxO1/3/4 liver-specific knock-out mice. In summary, our data suggest that Atg14 is a new target gene of FoxOs and the core clock machinery, and this gene plays an important role in hepatic lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1985924867,"Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) encoded by Orai1 proteins is a ubiquitous Ca(2+)-selective conductance involved in cellular proliferation and migration. We recently described up-regulation of Orai3 channels that selectively mediate SOCE in estrogen receptor α-expressing (ERα(+)) breast cancer cells. However, the connection between ERα and Orai3 and the role of Orai3 in tumorigenesis remain unknown. Here, we show that ERα knockdown decreases Orai3 mRNA (by ∼63%) and protein (by ∼44%) with no effect on Orai1. ERα knockdown decreases Orai3-mediated SOCE (by ∼43%) and the corresponding Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) current (by ∼42%) in ERα(+) MCF7 cells. The abrogation of SOCE in MCF7 cells on ERα knockdown can be rescued by ectopic expression of Orai3. ERα activation increased Orai3 expression and SOCE in MCF7 cells. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and thrombin stimulate Ca(2+) influx into MCF7 cells through Orai3. Orai3 knockdown inhibited SOCE-dependent phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2; by ∼44%) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK; by ∼46%) as well as transcriptional activity of nuclear factor for activated T cells (NFAT; by ∼49%). Significantly, Orai3 knockdown selectively decreased anchorage-independent growth (by ∼58%) and Matrigel invasion (by ∼44%) of ERα(+) MCF7 cells with no effect on ERα(-) MDA-MB231 cells. Moreover, Orai3 knockdown inhibited ERα(+) cell tumorigenesis in immunodeficient mice (∼66% reduction in tumor volume). These data establish Orai3 as an ERα-regulated channel and a potential selective therapeutic target for ERα(+) breast cancers."

Although treatment options such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery have led to a decline in the mortality rate due to GC, chemoresistance remains as one of the major causes for poor prognosis and high recurrence rate. In this study, we investigated the potential effects of isorhamnetin (IH), a 3′-O-methylated metabolite of quercetin on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) signaling cascade using proteomics technology platform, GC cell lines, and xenograft mice model. We observed that IH exerted a strong antiproliferative effect and increased cytotoxicity in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs. IH also inhibited the migratory/invasive properties of GC cells, which could be reversed in the presence of PPAR-γ inhibitor. We found that IH increased PPAR-γ activity and modulated the expression of PPAR-γ regulated genes in GC cells. Also, the increase in PPAR-γ activity was reversed in the presence of PPAR-γ-specific inhibitor and a mutated PPAR-γ dominant negative plasmid, supporting our hypothesis that IH can act as a ligand of PPAR-γ. Using molecular docking analysis, we demonstrate that IH formed interactions with seven polar residues and six nonpolar residues within the ligand-binding pocket of PPAR-γ that are reported to be critical for its activity and could competitively bind to PPAR-γ. IH significantly increased the expression of PPAR-γ in tumor tissues obtained from xenograft model of GC. Overall, our findings clearly indicate that antitumor effects of IH may be mediated through modulation of the PPAR-γ activation pathway in GC.

https://openalex.org/W1989042049,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are extracellular zinc-dependent endopeptidases involved in the degradation and remodeling of extracellular matrix in physiological and pathological processes. MMPs also have a role in cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. We previously identified cancer invasion-related factors by comparing the gene expression profiles between parent and the highly invasive clone of cancer cells. Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) was identified as a common up-regulated gene by cancer invasion-related factors. Although MMP-13 slightly promoted tumor invasion, we found that MMP-13 was involved in tumor angiogenesis. Conditioned medium from MMP-13-overexpressing cells promoted capillary formation of immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Furthermore, treatment with recombinant MMP-13 protein enhanced capillary tube formation both in vitro and in vivo. MMP-13-promoted capillary tube formation was mediated by activation of focal adhesion kinase and ERK. Interestingly, MMP-13 promoted the secretion of VEGF-A from fibroblasts and endothelial cells. By immunohistochemical analysis, we found a possible correlation between MMP-13 expression and the number of blood vessels in human cancer cases. In summary, these findings suggest that MMP-13 may directly and indirectly promote tumor angiogenesis.

By immunohistochemical analysis, we found a possible correlation between MMP-13 expression and the number of blood vessels in human cancer cases. In summary, these findings suggest that MMP-13 may directly and indirectly promote tumor angiogenesis. The process of metastasis consists of sequential and selective steps, including proliferation, induction of angiogenesis, detachment, motility, invasion into circulation, aggregation and survival in the circulation, cell arrest in distant capillary beds and extravasation into organ parenchyma (1Fidler I.J. Critical factors in the biology of human cancer metastasis: twenty-eighth G.H.A. Clowes memorial award lecture.Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6130-6138PubMed Google Scholar, 2Howell G.M. Grandis J.R. Molecular mediators of metastasis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Head Neck. 2005; 27: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Induction of angiogenesis is considered one of the important steps in the metastatic cascade of tumors. It is widely accepted that tumor growth and metastasis are angiogenesis-dependent, and hence, blocking angiogenesis could be a strategy to arrest tumor growth (3Folkman J. Tumor angiogenesis.in: Holland J.F. Cancer Medicine. 5th Ed. B. C. Decker, Inc., Ontario, Canada2000: 132-152Google Scholar). The “angiogenic switch” is “off” when the effect of proangiogenic molecules is balanced by that of anti-angiogenic molecules, and is “on” when the net balance is tipped in favor of angiogenesis (4Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. The hallmarks of cancer.Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22275) Google Scholar, 5Bouck N. Stellmach V. Hsu S.C. How tumors become angiogenic.Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 69: 135-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pro- and anti-angiogenic molecules can be emanated from cancer cells, endothelial cells, stromal cells, blood, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) 3The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixMMPmatrix metalloproteinaseVEGFvascular endothelial growth factorFAKfocal adhesion kinaseHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellHNSCChead and neck squamous cell carcinomaTGF-βtransforming growth factor-β: α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin.

Their relative contribution is likely to change with tumor type and site. It is also likely to change with tumor growth, regression and relapse. However, the interplay between environmental and genetic mechanisms influencing tumor angiogenesis and growth is a complex and largely unresolved matter. extracellular matrix matrix metalloproteinase vascular endothelial growth factor focal adhesion kinase human umbilical vein endothelial cell head and neck squamous cell carcinoma transforming growth factor-β: α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin. The ECM undergoes significant remodeling during tumor progression and this is mediated largely by the extracellular proteinases, particularly the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and the major source of these is from the stromal cells (7Egeblad M. Werb Z. New functions for the matrix metalloproteinases in cancer progression.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5115) Google Scholar). MMPs represent a family of zinc-dependent proteinases, which are able to degrade ECM components such as collagens and proteoglycans and have a role in normal development and tissue damage in various pathophysiological conditions involving arthritis, wound healing, and tumor development (8Milner J.M. Cawston T.E. Matrix metalloproteinase knockout studies and the potential use of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors in the rheumatic diseases.Curr. Drug Targets Inflamm. Allergy. 2005; 4: 363-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). MMPs can be classified into subgroups, including collagenases, stromelysins, gelatinases, and membrane-type MMPs (9Werner J.A. Rathcke I.O. Mandic R. The role of matrix metalloproteinases in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2002; 19: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). MMPs have been implicated in the promotion of tumor invasion and metastasis for decades (10Coussens L.M. Fingleton B. Matrisian L.M. Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors and cancer: trials and tribulations.Science. 2002; 295: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (2369) Google Scholar). It is now evident that MMP function is more complex than initially thought, given that these enzymes do more than degrade physical barriers. MMPs also affect multiple signaling pathways that modulate the biology of the cell in normal physiological processes and in disease. It is now evident that some MMPs such as MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -9, -14, and -16 can contribute to distinct vascular events in tumors (11Littlepage L.E. Sternlicht M.D. Rougier N. Phillips J. Gallo E. Yu Y. Williams K. Brenot A. Gordon J.I. Werb Z. Matrix metalloproteinases contribute distinct roles in neuroendocrine prostate carcinogenesis, metastasis, and angiogenesis progression.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Among them, MMP-9, conveyed by inflammatory cells, has a distinct role in tumor angiogenesis, mainly regulating the bioavailability of VEGF. MMP-9 enables an angiogenic switch by making sequestered VEGF bioavailable for its receptor VEGFR-2 in pancreatic islet tumors (12Bergers G. Brekken R. McMahon G. Vu T.H. Itoh T. Tamaki K. Tanzawa K. Thorpe P. Itohara S. Werb Z. Hanahan D. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 triggers the angiogenic switch during carcinogenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). In addition, the direct cleavage of matrix-bound VEGF by MMP-3, -7, -9, or -16 results in modified VEGF molecules with altered bioavailability, which changes the vascular patterning of tumors in vivo (13Lee S. Jilani S.M. Nikolova G.V. Carpizo D. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Processing of VEGF-A by matrix metalloproteinases regulates bioavailability and vascular patterning in tumors.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). However, the degradation of ECM components and other extracellular molecules may generate fragments with new bioactivities that inhibit angiogenesis (14Ribatti D. Endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis: a historical review.Leuk. Res. 2009; 33: 638-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, MMPs have dual functions as inhibiting and promoting angiogenesis, and the effects of MMPs on angiogenesis might be diverse. It has recently been shown that a repair of bone fracture in MMP-13-deficient mice is delayed, which suggests a critical role of MMP-13 in the process of angiogenesis during the healing of fracture (15Kosaki N. Takaishi H. Kamekura S. Kimura T. Okada Y. Minqi L. Amizuka N. Chung U.I. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. Toyama Y. D'Armiento J. Impaired bone fracture healing in matrix metalloproteinase-13 deficient mice.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 846-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Additionally, chicken MMP-13 was shown to directly contribute to neovascularization, which clearly extends the physiologic role of MMP-13 associated with cartilage and bone resorption to collagen remodeling in the angiogenic process (16Zijlstra A. Aimes R.T. Zhu D. Regazzoni K. Kupriyanova T. Seandel M. Deryugina E.I. Quigley J.P. Collagenolysis-dependent angiogenesis mediated by matrix metalloproteinase-13 (collagenase-3).J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27633-27645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). MMP-13 is known as collagenase-3 and is active against a wide variety of ECM components (17Freije J.M. Díez-Itza I. Balbín M. Sánchez L.M. Blasco R. Tolivia J. López-Otín C. Molecular cloning and expression of collagenase-3, a novel human matrix metalloproteinase produced by breast carcinomas.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16766-16773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, high expression of MMP-13 has been related to tumor behavior and prognosis (18Nielsen B.S. Rank F. López J.M. Balbin M. Vizoso F. Lund L.R. Danø K. López-Otín C. Collagenase-3 expression in breast myofibroblasts as a molecular marker of transition of ductal carcinoma in situ lesions to invasive ductal carcinomas.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7091-7100PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that MMP-13 produced from stromal fibroblasts promotes angiogenesis through increased protein level of VEGF and VEGFR-2 in cancer invasive area (19Lederle W. Hartenstein B. Meides A. Kunzelmann H. Werb Z. Angel P. Mueller M.M. MMP13 as a stromal mediator in controlling persistent angiogenesis in skin carcinoma.Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 1175-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Here, we found that MMP-13 produced by cancer cells directly and indirectly promoted tumor angiogenesis. Active form of recombinant human MMP-13, which truncated from the C terminus was obtained from Chondrex, Inc. (Redmond, WA). This recombinant protein was made using the pET vector system in Escherichia coli. Recombinant TGF-β and ERK inhibitor, U0126 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor, FAK inhibitor 14, was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). MMP-13 inhibitor, CL82198, was obtained from Merck Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany). Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines (HCS2, HSC3, HSC4, Ca-9-22, Ho-1-N-1, and Ho-1-U-1) were provided by the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank. These cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Nacalai tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen) and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) under the condition of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; HuhT1 cells) were used in this study. HuhT1 cells were previously established by transfection with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (20Anno K. Hayashi A. Takahashi T. Mitsui Y. Ide T. Tahara H.

Normal fibroblasts were obtained from gingival tissues using standard explant techniques (21Schor S.L. Schor A.M. Rushton G. Smith L.

Normal fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Only cells between passages three and five were used in this study. Using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), total RNA from cultures of confluent cells was isolated. These isolates were quantified and their purity was evaluated by spectrophotometer. The cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA according to ReverTra Dash (Toyobo Biochemicals, Tokyo, Japan). We used the following primers: human MMP-13, 5′-ttgagctggactcattgtcg-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggagcctctcagtcatggag-3′ (reverse); human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5′-tccaccaccctgttgctgta-3′ (forward) and 5′-accacagtccatgccatcac-3′ (reverse). Aliquots of total cDNA were amplified with 1.25 units of rTaq-DNA polymerase (Qiagen), and this amplification was done in a thermal cycler (MyCyler, Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) for 30 cycles after initial 30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 60 °C, and extension for 1 min at 72 °C in all primers used. The amplification reaction products were resolved on 1.2% agarose/TAE gels (Nacalai tesque), electrophoresed at 100 mV, and then finally visualized by using ethidium bromide. pcDNA3.1-FLAG-MMP-13 expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Byrne (Harvard Medical School). We transfected MMP-13 into HSC3 cells. Then, G418 (300 μg/ml; Invivogen, San Diego, CA) was added to the culture medium after 48 h of transfection. After 2 weeks of G418 selection, we obtained the stable pool clones. Cell transfections were performed using FuGENE 6HD (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Conditioned media were collected after incubation with RPMI without FBS for 2 days. Logarithmically growing HSC4 and Ho-1-N-1 cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells/dish (6 cm) and transfected with 20 nm siRNA by using Oligofectamine® RNAi MAX (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were prepared and analyzed by Western blot analysis. At the same time, we changed to new medium, incubated for 48 h, and collected the conditioned medium. The following siRNA oligonucleotides were obtained from B-Bridge International, Inc.

The protein concentrations were measured by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Twenty μg of protein was subjected to 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by electroblotting onto a nitrocellulose filter. For detection of the immunocomplex, the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Anti-MMP-13 monoclonal antibody (Fuji Company Industries, Tokyo, Japan), anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma), and anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), anti-phospho-FAK (Tyr-576/Tyr-577) monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-phospho-Src (Tyr-416) polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FAK polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Src polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-ERK monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) were used. For detection of phosphorylated proteins, membranes were blocked with 3% milk/TBS-T and incubated with phospho-specific antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing in TBS-T, membranes were incubated with specific secondary antibodies, and the proteins were visualized as described previously. The MMP-13 activity was determined by a MMP-13 inhibitor assay kit (Chondrex, Inc., Redmond, WA, distributed by IWAI Chemicals Company, Japan, catalog no. 3003). A designate reaction was performed in the 96-well microtiter plate according to the manufacturer's instructions. The assay procedure was separated into two stages. First, diluted recombinant human MMP-13 (10 μg/ml) with dilution buffer B or conditioned medium (from control cells, MMP-13-overexpressing cells or MMP-13 siRNA-treated cells) was activated by adding 5 μl of aminophenylmercuric acetate at 35 °C for 60 min. Second, appropriate amounts of test samples with or without several inhibitors (U0126, FAK inhibitor 14 and CL82198) that diluted by solution B and reaction buffer to the wells were added to adjust the final volume to 160 μl. The reaction was initiated by adding 100 μl of substrate solution to each well. The collagenase reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of the stop solution to each well after incubating at room temperature for ∼30 min. The reaction fluorescence intensity was determined at λemission = 450 nm and λexcitation = 345 nm with Varioskan Flash (Thermo Scientific). The MMP-13 activity was determined by comparing with a standard response curve using buffer instead of inhibitor in similar conditions. All assays were carried out in three replications. Migration activity was measured by the use of a 24-well cell culture insert with 8-μm pores (Falcon Becton Dickinson). The lower compartment contained 0.5 ml of conditioned medium or serum-free medium with or without 100 ng/ml of recombinant MMP-13. After trypsinization, 5 × 104 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of serum-free medium and placed in the upper compartment of the cell culture insert for 4 h. To examine the activity of migration, the cells that had penetrated onto the lower side of the filter were fixed with formalin and stained with hematoxylin. These were assayed three times. An angiogenesis assay kit obtained from Kurabo (Osaka, Japan) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications (23Bishop E.T. Bell G.T. Bloor S. Broom I.J. Hendry N.F. Wheatley D.N. An in vitro model of angiogenesis: basic features.Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). HUVECs were treated with conditioned medium from MMP-13-overexpressing cells or control cells (1:1 mixture with the medium). HUVECs were also treated with different concentrations of recombinant MMP-13 protein (0, 50, 100 and 200 ng/ml). VEGF-A (2 μg/ml) was used as a positive control, and suramin (1 mm) was used as a negative control. We examined three wells/data point in a single experiment. The media were changed every 3 days. After 12 days, the cells were fixed at room temperature with cold 70% ethanol for 30 min. The cells were incubated with the anti-human CD31 antibody for 1 h at 37 °C and further with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. Visualization was achieved with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate-nitrobluetetrazolium. Capillary tube score was estimated with the Chalkley count method under a bright-field microscope (24Fox S.B. Leek R.D. Weekes M.P. Whitehouse R.M. Gatter K.C. Harris A.L. Quantitation and prognostic value of breast cancer angiogenesis: comparison of microvessel density, Chalkley count, and computer image analysis.J. Pathol. 1995; 177: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The effect of samples on angiogenesis was studied by culturing aortic explants in three-dimensional matrix gels according to the protocol described by Bauer et al. (25Bauer K.S. Cude K.J. Dixon S.C. Kruger E.A. Figg W.D. Carboxyamido-triazole inhibits angiogenesis by blocking the calcium-mediated nitric-oxide synthase-vascular endothelial growth factor pathway.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar). Thoracic aorta was excised from 7-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rat, and the fibroadipose tissue was removed. The aorta was sectioned into 1-mm-long cross-sections, rinsed with EBM-2 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD), placed on the Matrigel-coated wells, covered with additional 50 μl of Matrigel, and allowed to form a gel for more than 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Afterward, control was treated with EBM-2 medium only, and the test sample was treated with EBM-2 medium containing recombinant MMP-13 protein. Each medium was added every other day. All assays were performed by using five aortic rings per sample. Aortic rings were photographed on day 15. The area of angiogenic sprouting was calculated using Image-Pro Plus software program (Media Cybernetics). Microvessel densities were reported in square pixels. A fixed number of fibroblasts cultured in medium without FBS were treated with MMP-13 (0, 10 and 50 ng/ml) and/or TGF-β (1 ng/ml) for 24 h. The concentration of VEGF-A in the culture medium was quantified with commercial ELISA kit according to the manufacturers' instructions (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Sixty-seven tissue samples of human HNSCC were retrieved from the Surgical Pathology Registry of University of Peradeniya and Oral and Maxillofacial unit, Kandy Hospital, after being approved by the Ethical Committee of each institution. Informed consent obtained from all patients was verbal for this study, and then signature was obtained from all patients. Sixty-seven Sri Lankan HNSCC cases (42 male, nine female and 16 unknown; average age was 50.2 ± 13.2) were surgically resected from 1998 to 2004 before radiochemotherapy. Clinical information including metastasis was gathered from surgical records of the patients. Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Tumor tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 4-μm thick sections. For immunohistochemical staining, tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in descending grades of ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with methanol containing 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min. Antigen retrieval was done by the microwaving using a citrate phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), and then the sections were incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. Immunohistochemical staining was carried out by a monoclonal anti-MMP-13 antibody (Fuji Company Industries, 1:80). For detection of the reaction after incubation with secondary antibodies, we used diaminobenzidine (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). The sections were counterstained by hematoxylin and dehydrated in ascending grades of ethanol, and finally, the slides were mounted. By considering the percentage of positive cells and the overall staining intensity, MMP-13 was considered positive if over 10% of the tumor cells showed strong or diffuse staining. If less than 10% of the cells showed weak or no staining, it was considered negative. CD34 is an antigen present in hematopoietic progenitor cells and endothelial cells. Anti-CD34 antibody is a highly sensitive marker for endothelial cell differentiation and has also been studied as a marker for vascular tumors. To investigate the relation between angiogenesis and MMP-13, we stained all HNSCC cases with CD34 endothelial marker (Novocastra Laboratories Ltd., Newcastle, UK) by SABC method. To assess blood vessel density, we performed histomorphometric analysis. Three representative photomicrographs (areas where MMP-13 positivity were detected including invasive front) were taken from each case stained with CD34. First, we went through all the sections stained with MMP-13 and CD34 antibodies. The area was selected by the following criteria: (i) the expression of MMP-13, (ii) the included invasive tumor front, and (iii) the high number of blood vessels. Photographs of those tumors were taken in close proximity to MMP-13-expressing area including the invasive front. For MMP-13-negative cases, three areas from the invasive front were selected. Any positively stained endothelial cell or endothelial cell cluster, with or without a lumen, was considered as a single, countable blood vessel. Stromal area was quantitatively analyzed using digital image (Adobe Photoshop and Scion Image software). From each figure, total counts of blood vessels per stromal area were taken, and the average was calculated. The results were then compared with MMP-13 expression. A p value < 0.05 was required for assessing the significance. Correlation between variables was estimated using Fisher's exact test, and for correlation between MMP-13 expression and blood vessel density, a Welch test was used. We previously identified periostin, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1), and Wnt-5b as cancer invasion-related factors by comparing the gene expression profiles between parent and highly invasive clone of a cancer cell line (22Kudo Y. Ogawa I. Kitajima S. Kitagawa M. Kawai H. Gaffney P.M. Miyauchi M. Takata T. Periostin promotes invasion and anchorage-independent growth in the metastatic process of head and neck cancer.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6928-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). MMP-13 was identified as a common up-regulated molecule by comparing the gene expression profiles between control cells and periostin-overexpressing cells, control cells and IFITM1-overexpressing cells, and control cells and Wnt-5b-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1A) (26Deraz E.M. Kudo Y. Yoshida M. Obayashi M. Tsunematsu T. Tani H. Siriwardena S.B. Keikhaee M.R. Kiekhaee M.R. Qi G. Iizuka S. Ogawa I. Campisi G. Lo Muzio L. Abiko Y. Kikuchi A. Takata T. MMP-10/stromelysin-2 promotes invasion of head and neck cancer.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e25438Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is known that MMP-13 is highly expressed in various tumors and is related to tumor behavior and prognosis (18Nielsen B.S. Rank F. López J.M. Balbin M. Vizoso F. Lund L.R. Danø K. López-Otín C. Collagenase-3 expression in breast myofibroblasts as a molecular marker of transition of ductal carcinoma in situ lesions to invasive ductal carcinomas.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7091-7100PubMed Google Scholar). To know the role of MMP-13 in cancer development, we generated MMP-13-overexpressing cancer cells. Expression of MMP-13 mRNA was examined in six head and neck cancer cell lines (Fig. 1B). Among six cell lines, HSC2 and HSC3 cells showed lower expression of MMP-13 mRNA. Expression level of MMP-13 in these cells was lower than that in other cancer cells. Therefore, we transfected a FLAG-MMP-13 plasmid into HSC3 cells. Then, we obtained four stable clones and one stable pool clone of MMP-13-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1C). All stable clones highly expressed ectopic MMP-13 (Fig. 1C). In further experiments, clone 1 was used. By using MMP-13-overexpressing cells, we examined the role of MMP-13 in cell growth and invasion. MMP-13 overexpression did not affect cell proliferation and slightly promoted the invasion of HNSCC cells (data not shown). We also confirmed that conditioned medium from MMP-13-overexpressing cells had a higher protease activity than that from control cells (Fig. 1D). MMP-13 has recently been shown to play a critical role in the process of angiogenesis during the healing of fracture (15Kosaki N. Takaishi H. Kamekura S. Kimura T. Okada Y. Minqi L. Amizuka N. Chung U.I. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. Toyama Y. D'Armiento J. Impaired bone fracture healing in matrix metalloproteinase-13 deficient mice.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 846-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the role of MMP-13 in angiogenesis. MMP-13 secretion was detected in conditioned medium from MMP-13-overexpressing-HSC3 cells by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1E). Expression level of ectopic MMP-13 in MMP-13-overexpressing HSC3 cells was similar to that of endogenous MMP-13 in Ho-1-N-1 or HSC4 cells (Fig. 1F). By using conditioned medium from MMP-13-overexpressing cells, we examined the migration of immortalized HUVECs. The HuhT1 cell line was previously established from HUVECs by transfection with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (20Anno K. Hayashi A. Takahashi T. Mitsui Y. Ide T. Tahara H. Telomerase activation induces elongation of the telomeric single-stranded overhang, but does not prevent chromosome aberrations in human vascular endothelial cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

https://openalex.org/W1602713063,"Compelling evidence indicates that aggregation of the amyloid β (Aβ) peptide is a major underlying molecular culprit in Alzheimer disease. Specifically, soluble oligomers of the 42-residue peptide (Aβ42) lead to a series of events that cause cellular dysfunction and neuronal death. Therefore, inhibiting Aβ42 aggregation may be an effective strategy for the prevention and/or treatment of disease. We describe the implementation of a high throughput screen for inhibitors of Aβ42 aggregation on a collection of 65,000 small molecules. Among several novel inhibitors isolated by the screen, compound D737 was most effective in inhibiting Aβ42 aggregation and reducing Aβ42-induced toxicity in cell culture. The protective activity of D737 was most significant in reducing the toxicity of high molecular weight oligomers of Aβ42. The ability of D737 to prevent Aβ42 aggregation protects against cellular dysfunction and reduces the production/accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Most importantly, treatment with D737 increases the life span and locomotive ability of flies in a Drosophila melanogaster model of Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W1996451200,"Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is a major Ca2+ signaling pathway responsible for regulating numerous transcriptional events. In cardiomyocytes SOCE has been shown to play an important role in regulating hypertrophic signaling pathways, including nuclear translocation of NFAT. Acute activation of pathways leading to O-GlcNAc synthesis have been shown to impair SOCE-mediated transcription and in diabetes, where O-GlcNAc levels are chronically elevated, cardiac hypertrophic signaling is also impaired. Therefore the goal of this study was to determine whether changes in cardiomyocyte O-GlcNAc levels impaired the function of STIM1, a widely recognized mediator of SOCE. We demonstrated that acute activation of SOCE in neonatal cardiomyocytes resulted in STIM1 puncta formation, which was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by increasing O-GlcNAc synthesis with glucosamine or inhibiting O-GlcNAcase with thiamet-G. Glucosamine and thiamet-G also inhibited SOCE and were associated with increased O-GlcNAc modification of STIM1. These results suggest that activation of cardiomyocyte O-GlcNAcylation attenuates SOCE via STIM1 O-GlcNAcylation and that this may represent a new mechanism by which increased O-GlcNAc levels regulate Ca2+-mediated events in cardiomyocytes. Further, since SOCE is a fundamental mechanism underlying Ca2+ signaling in most cells and tissues, it is possible that STIM1 represents a nexus linking protein O-GlcNAcylation with Ca2+-mediated transcription.

They also found that SOCE was required for activation of hypertrophic signaling pathways including nuclear translocation of NFAT by IP3-generating agonists such as phenylephrine and angiotensin II. The integration of SOCE into accepted models of Ca2+ homeostasis, particularly in excitable cells, was hampered for many years by the lack of specific molecular effectors; however, STIM, Orai, and TRPC protein families have recently emerged as key mediators of this Ca2+ signaling pathway (7Cheng, K.

The O-linked attachment of β-N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins is rapidly emerging as a key mediator of numerous biological processes including transcription; translation; nuclear transport and cytoskeletal assembly. This atypical protein glycosylation takes place primarily in the cytosol and the nucleus, rather than the secretory pathway, and is regulated by the activities of two key enzymes, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and N-acetylglucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase). The levels of protein O-GlcNAcylation are also dependent on the metabolism of glucose via the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP), which leads to the formation of UDP-GlcNAc, the substrate for OGT and the essential sugar donor for O-GlcNAc formation. Acute activation of O-GlcNAc levels has been shown to be an endogenous stress response, and augmentation of this response increased tolerance of cells to stress, whereas its attenuation increased cell death (24Zachara N.E.

Conversely, sustained increases in O-GlcNAc have been implicated in a number of chronic diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes and diabetic complications. Indeed, activation of the HBP and the resulting increase in O-GlcNAc levels have both been implicated in the adverse effects of diabetes on a variety of cells and tissues, including the heart. We recently reported that phenylephrine and angiotensin II induced hypertrophic signaling was blunted in cardiomyocytes from type-2 diabetic db/db mice, which was mediated at least in part by increased HBP flux and elevated protein O-GlcNAc levels (25Marsh S.A. Dell'Italia L.J. Chatham J.C. Activation of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway and protein O-GlcNAcylation modulate hypertrophic and cell signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes from diabetic mice.Amino Acids. 2011; 40: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly glucosamine, which increases HBP flux and leads to increased O-GlcNAc levels, inhibited SOCE in both J774 macrophages (26Darbha S. Marchase R.B. Regulation of intracellular calcium is closely linked to glucose metabolism in J774 macrophages.Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and cardiomyocytes (3Hunton D.L.

Hyperglycemia inhibits capacitative calcium entry and hypertrophy in neonatal cardiomyocytes.Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3461-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); furthermore, hyperglycemia, which also increases HBP flux and O-GlcNAc levels has been shown to inhibit SOCE in both vascular smooth muscle cells (27Rivera A.A. White C.R. Guest L.L. Elton T.S. Marchase R.B. Hyperglycemia alters cytoplasmic Ca2+ responses to capacitative Ca2+ influx in rat aortic smooth muscle cells.Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1482-C1488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cardiomyocytes (4Pang Y. Hunton D.L. Bounelis P. Marchase R.B. Hyperglycemia inhibits capacitative calcium entry and hypertrophy in neonatal cardiomyocytes.Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3461-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Of note, in cardiomyocytes the attenuation of SOCE and subsequent hypertrophic signaling was reversed by inhibition of glucose entry into the HBP (4Pang Y. Hunton D.L. Bounelis P. Marchase R.B. Hyperglycemia inhibits capacitative calcium entry and hypertrophy in neonatal cardiomyocytes.Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3461-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Nagy et al. reported that angiotensin II-induced increase in Ca2+ could be attenuated by increasing cardiomyocyte O-GlcNAc levels either by inhibiting O-GlcNAcase or by increasing the HBP with glucosamine (28Nagy T. Champattanachai V. Marchase R.B. Chatham J.C. Glucosamine inhibits angiotensin II-induced cytoplasmic Ca2+ elevation in neonatal cardiomyocytes via protein-associated O-linked N-acetylglucosamine.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 290: C57-C65Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Taken together these data support the notion that activation of cardiomyocyte O-GlcNAcylation attenuates SOCE. Therefore, given the central role of STIM1 in mediating SOCE, we postulated that increased O-GlcNAc levels would inhibit STIM1-mediated Ca2+ entry and further that STIM1 itself would be a target for O-GlcNAcylation and that this would be associated with decreased activation of STIM1. All animal experiments were approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996).

Thiamet-G was from SD ChemMolecules LLC (Owings Mills, MD). Thapsigargin and culture medium products were purchased from GIBCO Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY). Both adenoviruses, YFP-STIM1 and mCherry-Orai1, were from Vector Biolabs (Philadelphia, PA). Hearts were perfused as previously described (29Pang Y. Bounelis P. Chatham J.C. Marchase R.B.

Sections were incubated with primary antibodies against STIM1 (1:50; LB-B1880, LifeSpan BioSciences, Seattle, WA), sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase 2 (SERCA, 1:400; PA1–21904, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL), and ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR, 1:50; ARR-002, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) diluted in 5% goat serum in 1% bovine serum overnight at 4 °C; appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to either Alexa Fluor 488 (green) or 594 (red) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were used to visualize the specific proteins, with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; blue) to identify nuclei. Midwall sections of the left ventricular free wall were examined and image acquisition was performed on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 epifluorescence microscope with an AxioCam MRm cooled CCD camera and AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY). Linescans to detect intracellular patterns of O-GlcNAc distribution were generated using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). For preparation of the membrane compartment, heart tissue was homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer containing, in mm: 20 Tris (pH 7.4), 5.0 EDTA, 250 sucrose, 1.0 phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5% protease inhibitor mixture. Tissue homogenates (20% w/v) were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and debris, and the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for 75 min at 4 °C to pellet the crude membrane fraction (both the sarcolemmal and microsomal subfractions). The resulting pellet was resuspended in solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm lithium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% (w/v) SDS, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide) using a glass homogenizer. After incubation for 30 min on ice, the remaining insoluble material was collected by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Equal protein amounts of the supernatant (particulate membrane fraction) were suspended in 2× Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad), boiled for 5 min, and then immunoblotted and visualized as described below. Anti-Pan-cadherin, -SERCA, and -GAPDH antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) were used to verify the purity of membrane, the abundance of ER membrane in the membrane fractions and cytoplasmic fractions, respectively. Primary cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) were obtained from 2–3-day-old neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured as described previously (3Hunton D.L. Lucchesi P.A. Pang Y. Cheng X. Dell'Italia L.J. Marchase R.B. Capacitative calcium entry contributes to nuclear factor of activated T-cells nuclear translocation and hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes.J. Biol.

Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C1509-C1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). NRVMs were grown on collagen-coated plates in culture growth medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) on the first day. On the next day, medium was replaced, and cells were grown in culture growth medium without FBS. Within 1–2 days of isolation, a confluent monolayer of spontaneously beating NRVMs had formed. On the third day after isolation, NRVMs were infected with an adenovirus encoding enhanced yellow fluorescent protein linked to STIM1 (eYFP-STIM1, 2 moi) with or without another adenovirus encoding one of the fruit fluorescent proteins, mCherry, linked to Orai1 (mCherry-Orai1, 5 moi). After overnight infection, cells were subjected to SOCE stimulation as described below. Heart tissue (10 mg) was homogenized in 1 ml of T-PER (Pierce) supplemented with 40 μm PUGNAc (Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, Ontario, Canada), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm sodium fluoride, and 5% protease inhibitor mixture and lysed for 60 min on ice. Cultured NRVMs were lysed for 30 min on ice with 1× RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS] containing 2% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 40 μm PUGNAc, at the end of thapsigargin (5 mm) plus EGTA (2 mm) treatment. Consistent with our earlier studies, PUGNAc was present throughout the lysis protocol to inhibit O-GlcNAcase, thereby preventing loss of O-GlcNAc (32Liu J. Marchase R.B. Chatham J.C. Increased O-GlcNAc levels during reperfusion lead to improved functional recovery and reduced calpain proteolysis.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 293: H1391-H1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Lysed proteins from heart tissue or NRVMs were harvested by centrifuging at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and protein concentration of the supernatant was assessed using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Samples containing equal amount of protein (1000 μg for tissue and 500 μg for NRVMs) were mixed with polyclonal rabbit anti-STIM1 antibody (#4916, Cell Signaling, 1:50) or anti-GFP antibody (ab6556, Abcam, 1:250) overnight at 4 °C with protein A-agarose beads (Upstate). The agarose beads then were washed three times in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 followed by three additional washes with PBS. Antigens were eluted from the beads and boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer prior to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were incubated with anti-Orai1 (#1280, Cell Signaling, 1:500), anti-O-GlcNAc (CTD 110.6, Mary-Ann Accavitti, UAB Epitope Recognition and Immunoreagent Core, 1:1000), anti-phospho-MAPK/CDK substrates (#2325, Cell Signaling, 1:1000), anti-STIM1 (1:1000) and/or anti-GFP (1:5000) antibodies for overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence visualization. NRVMs were plated at a density of 100–400 cells/mm2 on eight-well slide chambers (NUNC) and were infected with an eYFP-STIM1 or mCherry-Orai1 adenovirus 24 h prior to imaging studies. Cells were then pre-treated with or without glucosamine or thiamet-G (an OGA inhibitor) for 1 h, washed with HBSS (H8264, Sigma) and CaCl2 (1.2 mm) and MgSO4 (1.0 mm) for three times, then stabilized in HBSS plus CaCl2 and MgSO4 for 30 min at room temperature. Live imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM710 confocal laser-scanning microscope through a 20× objective lens. Images were taken every 5 s with 37 or 97 cycles in total. Thapsigargin (5 mm) plus EGTA (2 mm) were added between 4th and 5th cycle to induce STIM1 puncta formation. For dose-response experiments, cells were cultured on the slides, pre-treated with glucosamine at 0, 50 μm, 100 μm, 0.5 mm, 1 mm, 5 mm, or 10 mm or thiamet-G at 0, 0.01 μm, 0.1 μm, 0.5 μm, 1 μm, or 5 μm for 1 h, washed three times with HBSS, then treated with thapsigargin in Ca2+-free HBSS for 4 min. Cells were fixed with PLP fixative (2% paraformaldehyde, 0.075 m lysine, 0.037 m sodium phosphate, 0.01 m periodate) for 30 min, washed with PBS for 3 times, mounted to microscope slide with Vectashield® Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories), sealed upside-down on the cover slide with nail polish and dried at room temperature before imaging. The data were collected and analyzed using light ZEN Elite and ImageJ. STIM1 puncta were analyzed using the “Analyze Particles” feature in ImageJ. Briefly, after background subtraction, fluorescent images are converted into a binary mask and puncta were identified based on their relative intensity, compared with background, size, and circularity. NRVMs were pre-treated with or without glucosamine or thiamet-G for 1 h prior to loading with Fluo-4 AM (1μM, F-14201, Invitrogen) for 45 min, washed three times, then stabilized in HBSS plus CaCl2 and MgSO4 for 30 min. Digital images were obtained in room-temperature HBSS plus CaCl2 and MgSO4 using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Images were taken every 15 s for 6 min to visualize KCl-activated Ca2+/Sr2+ entry or 12min for thapsigargin-activated Ca2+ entry. During imaging, the cells were treated with EGTA (2 mm) first for ∼2 min, stimulated with thapsigargin (5 μm) for ∼6 min and 1.2 mm Ca2+ was then added back for 4 min. To test the permeability of Sr2+, SrCl2 was applied instead of CaCl2 for close to 2min; then Ca2+ was added back for 2min. For KCl-activated Ca2+/Sr2+ entry, KCl (30 mm) plus SrCl2 (1.2 mm) or CaCl2 (1.2 mm) was added for 4 min after EGTA treatment. The fluorescence intensity was normalized to the initial fluorescence; thus the normalized fluorescence is reported as F/F0. The data were collected and analyzed using light ZEN Elite and ImageJ (version 1.44). All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons were performed with Student's t test or one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett or Tukey's multiple comparison test as indicated in the figure legends. Statistically significant differences between groups were defined as p < 0.05 and are indicated in the figure legends. STIM1, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) and ryanodine receptor (RyR) were all present throughout the left and right ventricles; however, to better visualize the striated nature of the SR the images and analyses presented in Fig. 1A were derived from the midwall of the left ventricular free wall. We show that STIM1 is not only present in the adult rat heart, but also that it is co-localized with both SERCA and RyR, consistent with it being localized to the SR. In Fig. 1B it is clear that both STIM1 and Orai1 proteins are present in the membrane fractions entirely consistent with data in non-excitable cells. To better characterize STIM1 function in cardiomyocytes, NRVMs were transfected overnight with eYFP-STIM1 adenovirus and/or mCherry-Orai1 adenovirus and live cell imaging performed before and after treatment of cells with thapsigargin and EGTA to deplete SR/ER Ca2+ stores. Under resting conditions STIM1 was present in distributed reticular fashion, consistent with SR/ER localization; however, following thapsigargin/EGTA the appearance of intense spots or puncta were readily observed within 1 min reaching a steady state within ∼3 min (Fig. 2A, and supplemental Fig. S1). Similarly in NRVMs transfected with mCherry-Orai1, thapsigargin/EGTA stimulated the formation of Orai1 puncta along the membrane and this also co-localized with STIM1 puncta formation (Fig. 2B). It should be noted that the imaging experiments were performed at room temperature, consequently, the kinetics of STIM1 puncta formation were slower and therefore more easily visualized than if studied at 37 °C. Thus, these data demonstrate that in NRVMs, consistent with studies in non-excitable cells, ER/SR Ca2+ store depletion induces the dynamic STIM1 puncta formation and the interaction between STIM1 and Orai1. We have previously demonstrated that SOCE is attenuated when protein O-GlcNAc levels are elevated by increasing flux through the HBP (3Hunton D.L. Lucchesi P.A. Pang Y. Cheng X. Dell'Italia L.J.

https://openalex.org/W2075141308,"The R753Q polymorphism in the Toll-IL-1 receptor domain of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) has been linked to increased incidence of tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, but the mechanisms by which it affects TLR2 functions are unclear. Here, we studied the impact of the R753Q polymorphism on TLR2 expression, hetero-dimerization with TLR6, tyrosine phosphorylation, and recruitment of myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD) 88 and MyD88 adapter-like (Mal). Complementation of HEK293 cells with transfected WT or R753Q TLR2 revealed their comparable total levels and only minimal changes in cell surface expression of the mutant species. Notably, even a 100-fold increase in amounts of transfected R753Q TLR2 versus WT variant did not overcome the compromised ability of the mutant TLR2 to activate nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), indicating that a minimal decrease in cell surface levels of the R753Q TLR2 cannot account for the signaling deficiency. Molecular modeling studies suggested that the R753Q mutation changes the electrostatic potential of the DD loop and results in a discrete movement of the residues critical for protein-protein interactions. Confirming these predictions, biochemical assays demonstrated that R753Q TLR2 exhibits deficient agonist-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, hetero-dimerization with TLR6, and recruitment of Mal and MyD88. These proximal signaling deficiencies correlated with impaired capacities of the R753Q TLR2 to mediate p38 phosphorylation, NF-κB activation, and induction of IL-8 mRNA in transfected HEK293 cells challenged with inactivated Mycobacterium tuberculosis or mycobacterial components. Thus, the R753Q polymorphism renders TLR2 signaling-incompetent by impairing its tyrosine phosphorylation, dimerization with TLR6, and recruitment of Mal and MyD88."
https://openalex.org/W2008271008,"MARK4, also known as Par-1d/MarkL1, is a member of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-related family of kinases, which are implicated in the regulation of dynamic biological functions, including glucose and energy homeostasis. However, the physiological function of MARK4 in mammals remains elusive. Here, we investigated a role for MARK4 in regulating energy homeostasis by generating mice with targeted inactivation of the mark4 gene. We show that MARK4 deficiency in mice caused hyperphagia, hyperactivity, and hypermetabolism, leading to protection from diet-induced obesity and its related metabolic complications through up-regulation of brown fat activity. Consequently, MARK4 deficiency mitigated insulin resistance associated with diet-induced obesity by dramatically enhancing insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in major metabolic tissues. Ablation of MARK4 also significantly improved glucose homeostasis by up-regulating the activity and expression of AMPK kinase in key metabolic tissues. Taken together, these data identify a key role of MARK4 in energy metabolism, implicating the kinase as a novel drug target for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1972425904,"Voltage-gated Na(+) channels in the brain are composed of a single pore-forming α subunit, one non-covalently linked β subunit (β1 or β3), and one disulfide-linked β subunit (β2 or β4). The final step in Na(+) channel biosynthesis in central neurons is concomitant α-β2 disulfide linkage and insertion into the plasma membrane. Consistent with this, Scn2b (encoding β2) null mice have reduced Na(+) channel cell surface expression in neurons, and action potential conduction is compromised. Here we generated a series of mutant β2 cDNA constructs to investigate the cysteine residue(s) responsible for α-β2 subunit covalent linkage. We demonstrate that a single cysteine-to-alanine substitution at extracellular residue Cys-26, located within the immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, abolishes the covalent linkage between α and β2 subunits. Loss of α-β2 covalent complex formation disrupts the targeting of β2 to nodes of Ranvier in a myelinating co-culture system and to the axon initial segment in primary hippocampal neurons, suggesting that linkage with α is required for normal β2 subcellular localization in vivo. WT β2 subunits are resistant to live cell Triton X-100 detergent extraction from the hippocampal axon initial segment, whereas mutant β2 subunits, which cannot form disulfide bonds with α, are removed by detergent. Taken together, our results demonstrate that α-β2 covalent association via a single, extracellular disulfide bond is required for β2 targeting to specialized neuronal subcellular domains and for β2 association with the neuronal cytoskeleton within those domains."

In this study, we report a new oxidation-sensing regulator, Rv1049 or MosR (M. tuberculosis oxidation-sensing regulator). MosR is a transcriptional repressor of the MarR family, which, similarly to Bacillus subtilis OhrR and Staphylococcus aureus MgrA, dissociates from DNA in the presence of oxidants, enabling transcription. MosR senses oxidation through a pair of cysteines near the N terminus (Cys-10 and Cys-12) that upon oxidation forms a disulfide bond. Disulfide formation rearranges a network of hydrogen bonds, which leads to a large conformational change of the protein and dissociation from DNA. MosR has been shown previously to play an important role in survival of the bacterium in the macrophage.

Thanks to impressive international efforts, the rate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections is beginning to decrease (1World Health OrganizationGlobal Tuberculosis Control. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2011: 1-27Google Scholar). However, with an estimated 8.8 million cases of tuberculosis and 1.1 million deaths reported in 2010, there is still plenty to do before we can foresee the possible eradication of the disease. In addition, the demographics of the disease (it mostly occurs in developing countries), the vast reservoir for potential reactivation (up to one-third of the world population is latently infected), and the emergence of drug-resistant strains (650,000 estimated prevalent cases in 2010) make accomplishing its eradication a formidable task (1World Health OrganizationGlobal Tuberculosis Control. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2011: 1-27Google Scholar). Although current therapies are effective in killing the bacterium, they require multiple months of therapy, which reduces the compliance of patients and increases the risk of drug resistance. To develop superior therapies and vaccines, we need to gain better understanding of the physiology of the bacterium.

OxyR, although present in related species such as Mycobacterium leprae, has acquired several nonsense mutations in M. tuberculosis, and it is nonfunctional; SoxR, also present in the related species Mycobacterium smegmatis, does not have a homolog in M. tuberculosis; and so far, no MgrA/OhrR homologs have been described in M. tuberculosis. Recently, Voskuil et al. (24Voskuil M.I. Bartek I.L. Visconti K. Schoolnik G.K. The response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.Front. Microbiol. 2011; 2: 105Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) examined the transcriptional response of M. tuberculosis to ROS and RNS. They found that under low concentrations of H2O2 (0.05 and 0.5 mm), only furA, the regulator of catalase peroxidase (KatG), was induced. Concentrations of 50 mm or higher were lethal to the bacteria and gave relatively few transcriptional changes. Intermediate concentrations between 5 and 10 mm caused a number of genes and regulators to be induced including those involved in iron response, iron-sulfur cluster repair, ROS/RNS damage repair, and DNA repair. They concluded that besides FurA (25Zahrt T.C. Song J. Siple J. Deretic V. Mycobacterial FurA is a negative regulator of catalase-peroxidase gene katG.Mol.

In this study, we describe a new oxidation-sensitive transcriptional regulator in M. tuberculosis, a homolog of Bacillus subtilis OhrR and S. aureus MgrA that we named MosR (M. tuberculosis oxidation-sensing regulator) and propose a molecular mechanism for MosR in the context of infection. All procedures involving live M. tuberculosis were carried out in a biosafety level III laboratory. Additional details for these and other experimental procedures can be found in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. All the MosR protein variants were expressed in Escherichia coli using the codon-optimized sequence on a modified pET28a vector containing a thrombin-cleavable C-terminal His tag. After overnight expression at 16 °C, the protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Plasmids and primers used for cloning and expression are shown in supplemental Tables S1 and S2. For crystallization purposes, a construct containing a four-amino acid truncation on the N terminus (amino acids 2–5) was used. Crystallization experiments were carried out using hanging-drop vapor diffusion at room temperature and 16 °C. Datasets on frozen crystals were collected at beamline 24-ID of the Argonne National Laboratory. All data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of X-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38556) Google Scholar). The structure of MosR-DNA complex was solved by molecular replacement in Phaser (30McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J.

To solve apo-MosR, we used a model based on the newly obtained structure of MosR-DNA. The structures were refined using PHENIX (32Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N.

Schrödinger, LLC, New York2010Google Scholar). Full data collection and refinement statistics can be found in supplemental Table S3. Purified recombinant MosR (50 nm) was combined with a 32P-labeled DNA (5 nm) corresponding to the 100–300-bp region upstream of the gene under investigation in the presence of excess salmon-sperm DNA and different concentration of oxidants as specified in Fig. 3. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. DTT was added to the specified samples 15 min after the addition of the oxidant. Samples were run on 4% polyacrylamide native gels, and afterward the gels were dried and exposed to a phosphor screen overnight, and images acquired using a Bio-Rad Pharos FX molecular imager. DNase I footprinting assay was carried out using the protocol from Leblanc and Moss (35Leblanc B. Moss T. DNase I footprinting.Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 30: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 nm DNA corresponding to the promoter region labeled on one end only was combined with 500 nm protein in the presence of 1 mm DTT. 0.5 units of DNase I were added to the mix and allowed to react for 4 min. Then the reaction was stopped by the addition of STOP solution. Sequencing reactions were performed using the Sequenase kit from Affymetrix. Both samples were run side-by-side on a 4% native gel. The images were acquired as in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays. ΔmosR strain was constructed using the pGOAL/p2NIL system developed by Parish and Stoker (36Parish T. Stoker N.G. Use of a flexible cassette method to generate a double unmarked Mycobacterium tuberculosis tlyA plcABC mutant by gene replacement.Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1969-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Complementation strains were prepared by transforming ΔmosR strain with the appropriate plasmid. A list with the plasmids used in this study can be found in supplemental Table S1. RNA isolation and microarray were performed as reported previously (24Voskuil M.I. Bartek I.L. Visconti K. Schoolnik G.K. The response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.Front. Microbiol. 2011; 2: 105Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 37Wilson M. Voskuil M. Schnappinger D. Schoolnik G.K. Functional genomics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using DNA microarrays.Methods Mol. Med. 2001; 54: 335-357PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed using SuperScript one-step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). Primers used are shown in supplemental Table S2. Intrigued by the lack of obvious oxidation-sensing regulators in M. tuberculosis, we decided to look for homologs of B. subtilis OhrR and S. aureus MgrA in M. tuberculosis H37Rv proteome. A direct BLAST-P search for homologs yielded no hits in M. tuberculosis, but found one candidate in the closely related species M. smegmatis that belongs to the MarR family, MSMEG_0448 (43% identical over 145 amino acids to OhrR and 35% identical over 143 amino acids to MgrA). MSMEG_0448 as an OhrR homolog is further supported by the recent discovery that adjacent protein MSMEG_0447, is a homolog of organic hydroperoxide resistance protein (Ohr) (38Ta P. Buchmeier N. Newton G.L. Rawat M. Fahey R.C. Organic hydroperoxide resistance protein and ergothioneine compensate for loss of mycothiol in Mycobacterium smegmatis mutants.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 1981-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A subsequent search for homologs of MSMEG_0448 found one potential candidate in M. tuberculosis: Rv1049 (26% identical over 147 amino acids) (Fig. 1, supplemental Fig. S1) that we named MosR. Although MosR is only 28% identical over 103 amino acids to OhrR and 28% identical over 106 amino acids to MgrA, we thought it might share an oxidation-sensing mechanism as it contains the cysteine presumed to serve for oxidation sensing in a conserved position (Cys-12) and an additional adjacent cysteine (Cys-10) not conserved in OhrR/MgrA. In addition, in these oxidation-sensing regulators, the conserved cysteine is typically surrounded by aromatic amino acids (39Poole L.B. Nelson K.J. Discovering mechanisms of signaling-mediated cysteine oxidation.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008; 12: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), which are also conserved in MosR (Tyr-13, Tyr-26, and Phe-40). After failed attempts to express MosR in E. coli from the native DNA sequence, we turned to a synthetic variant containing the codon-optimized sequence for E. coli. This construct expressed well, and we were able to purify the protein to reasonable yields (0.1 mg/liter) and high purity using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Fig. 2A). We noticed that if the protein was purified in the absence of reducing agents, a new band with retarded mobility appeared on a nonreducing SDS-PAGE gel, suggesting partial oxidation and formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond that may induce a conformational change of the protein (Fig. 2B). We then sought to identify and confirm the disulfide bond using mass spectrometry. For this experiment, we subjected MosR to three different conditions (1 mm DTT, 1 h of air oxidation, and 5 mm H2O2) followed by alkylation, trypsin digestion, and LC-MS/MS analysis. In the presence of 1 mm DTT, we found no evidence for the presence of disulfide bonds in the protein. Under air oxidation, which mimics the conditions in which we observe a double band on SDS-PAGE gel, we found one disulfide bond between Cys-10 and Cys-12 (Fig. 2C). Under 5 mm H2O2, we found evidence for two disulfide bonds with one between Cys-10 and Cys-12 and another between Cys-96 and Cys-147 (supplemental Fig. S2). These data show that formation of disulfide between Cys-10 and Cys-12 is more facile and likely represents the primary biological mechanism used by MosR to sense oxidation. To test whether MosR functions as an oxidation-sensing transcriptional regulator, we tested its ability to bind to DNA in the presence of oxidants. We speculated that similar to other MarR proteins, MosR would be autoregulated, and therefore we chose a 300-bp fragment of DNA directly upstream of the mosR gene to test for DNA binding. The protein bound to the amplified DNA even in the presence of 10-fold excess of nonspecific DNA with a Kd of ∼15 nm (supplemental Fig. S3A). Subsequently, we tested the ability of the protein to bind DNA in the presence of increasing concentrations of oxidants including H2O2, cumene hydroperoxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and the NO precursor spermine-NONOate (Fig. 3, A–C, supplemental Fig. S3B). In all cases, except with the NO precursor, we saw dissociation of the protein from DNA upon the addition of 0.5–1 mm of the respective oxidant. This dissociation was reversible upon the addition of the reducing agent, DTT (Fig. 3, A–C). Spermine-NONOate did not cause dissociation of the protein from the DNA up to 1 mm, and concentrations of 10 mm or higher led to protein aggregation due to the tendency of spermine to precipitate proteins. We then assayed the role of the cysteines in oxidation-dependent DNA binding. MosR contains four cysteines: Cys-10, Cys-12, Cys-96, and Cys-147. Only Cys-12 is conserved among oxidation-sensing OhrR/MgrA proteins, and thus we focused our attention on this cysteine and the proximal Cys-10. Substitution of Cys-10 or Cys-12 by serine results in proteins with lower sensitivity to oxidation as shown in Fig. 3D. Under the assayed conditions, treatment with 1 mm H2O2 for 1 h is sufficient to completely dissociate the wild-type MosR but not the Cys-to-Ser substituted proteins. Double mutation of Cys-10 and Cys-12 to serine results in a protein with decreased DNA binding affinity even under reducing conditions. In our experience, substitution of Cys to Ser in this family of proteins often affects the stability of the protein. The partial dissociation of MosR-C10S and MosR-C12S with >1 mm H2O2 may be due to nonspecific oxidation of the protein or additional oxidation-sensing mechanisms. Nonetheless, the lower sensitivity of the substituted proteins with Cys-10 and Cys-12 replaced by Ser suggests that these residues play important roles in the oxidation-sensing mechanism, which is consistent with disulfide bond formation between these two residues. This type of behavior in which substitution from Cys-12 to Ser results in a protein less responsive to oxidation is reminiscent of OhrR and MgrA (16Chen P.R. Bae T. Williams W.A. Duguid E.M. Rice P.A. Schneewind O. He C. An oxidation-sensing mechanism is used by the global regulator MgrA in Staphylococcus aureus.Nat. Chem.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1389-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We then performed a DNase I footprinting assay to determine the specific sequence that MosR binds. A 26-base-long quasi-palindromic motif starting 31 bases upstream of mosR (rv1049) starting codon was revealed as the binding site of MosR (Fig. 4A). A pattern search for similar sequences in the genome of M. tuberculosis unveiled similar sequences in the promoter regions of rv1050, ndhA, narL, narX, ndhA, and esxR (Fig. 4B). We then tested for binding to those promoters and confirmed that in addition to binding to its own promoter, MosR can bind to the promoters of rv1050 and narX, and to a lower extent, ndhA (Fig. 4C). These experiments allowed us to determine the sequence GTGTAn nTACAC (n = A, C, G, or T), as the consensus recognition motif of MosR. This motif is strictly conserved in the promoters of mosR (or rv1049), rv1050, and narX (or rv1736c), but it contains two mismatches in the promoters of ndhA and esxR and three in narL promoter, which explains why MosR does not bind to these promoters or why it does so with reduced affinity. Interestingly, Rv1050 and NarX are thought to be involved in reduction processes, which is consistent with being controlled by an oxidation-sensitive transcriptional regulator. Rv1050 is an exported protein (41Målen H. Berven F.S. Fladmark K.E. Wiker H.G. Comprehensive analysis of exported proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv.Proteomics. 2007; 7: 1702-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) predicted to function as an oxidoreductase, and NarX is a predicted nitrite reductase, part of the dosR regulon, known to be induced by NO and hypoxia (42Sherman D.R.

We next crystallized and solved the structures of MosR bound to a 28-bp duplex DNA and the apo form (Fig. 5, A and B). The MosR-DNA complex crystallized in the R3 space group, and the structure was solved to 3.1 Å resolution. Apo-MosR crystallized in the P212121 space group and was solved to 2.7 Å resolution. In both structures, MosR forms a dimer of triangular shape with the two monomers related by noncrystallographic symmetry. These two structures resemble the structures of OhrR and SlyA with and without DNA (31Hong M. Fuangthong M. Helmann J.D. Brennan R.G.

Each monomer contains six α-helices and three antiparallel β-strands forming a β-sheet (there are only two β-strands in the DNA-bound structure as β1 becomes disordered). Strand β1 is longer than in related structures due to the insertion of five amino acids (Gly-51–Ile-55) between α2 and α3. Helices α1, α5, and α6 form the dimerization domain with α6 going over α1 helix of the adjacent monomer. Helices α3 and α4 and the connecting loop form the characteristic helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. On the MosR-DNA complex structure, helices α1 and α1′ (prime refers to the opposing monomer) sit atop the DNA forming extensive contacts with the phosphate backbone on the minor groove of the DNA. α4 and α4′ fit into two consecutive major grooves recognizing the palindromic sequence GTGTAn nTACAC mainly through the side chains of Arg-70, Thr-71, Thr-72, and Asn-76 (supplemental Fig. S4, C and D). Between α4 and α5, there is a stretch of 21 amino acids forming two antiparallel β-strands (β2 and β3) that extend over the minor grooves making extensive contacts with phosphates, sugar oxygens, and the O2 position of a thymidine base three bases away from the end of the palindrome. On the base of the triangle, the side chains of α1, α2, α1′, and α2′ form an extended array of hydrogen bonds parallel to the helices. Starting on one end, Cys-12 (α1) interacts with Asn-37′ (α2′) from the other monomer, which further interacts with Arg-16 (α1) that is hydrogen-bonded to a phosphate ion situated in the center of the protein. Symmetrically, the phosphate interacts with Arg-16′ (α1′) from the other monomer, then Asn-37 (α2) and, finally, Cys-12′ (α1′) (Fig. 5C). In this structure, the Cβ atoms of Cys-10 and Cys-12 are positioned 5.5 Å aw"

We found that the IQ-motif-containing GTPase-activating protein IQGAP1 interacts directly with GTP-bound, prenylated RhoA and RhoC, but not with RhoB. Co-immunoprecipitation of IQGAP1 with endogenous RhoA/C was enhanced when RhoA/C were activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or transfection of a constitutively active guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Overexpression of IQGAP1 increased GTP-loading of RhoA/C, while siRNA-mediated depletion of IQGAP1 prevented endogenous RhoA/C activation by growth factors. IQGAP1 knockdown also reduced the amount of GTP bound to GTPase-deficient RhoA/C mutants, suggesting that IQGAP enhances Rho activation by GEF(s) or stabilizes Rho-GTP. IQGAP1 depletion in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells blocked EGF- and RhoA-induced stimulation of DNA synthesis. Infecting cells with adenovirus encoding constitutively active RhoAL63 and measuring absolute amounts of RhoA-GTP in infected cells demonstrated that the lack of RhoAL63-induced DNA synthesis in IQGAP1-depleted cells was not due to reduced GTP-bound RhoA. These data suggested that IQGAP1 functions downstream of RhoA. Overexpression of IQGAP1 in MDA-MB-231 cells increased DNA synthesis irrespective of siRNA-mediated RhoA knockdown. Breast cancer cell motility was increased by expressing a constitutively-active RhoCV14 mutant or overexpressing IQGAP1. EGF- or RhoC-induced migration required IQGAP1, but IQGAP1-stimulated migration independently of RhoC, placing IQGAP1 downstream of RhoC. We conclude that IQGAP1 acts both upstream of RhoA/C, regulating their activation state, and downstream of RhoA/C, mediating their effects on breast cancer cell proliferation and migration, respectively.

To better understand the molecular basis for the opposing effects of RhoA/C and RhoB, we searched for RhoA/C- and RhoB-specific interaction proteins using a proteomics screen. We found IQGAP1 is a specific binding partner for GTP-bound RhoA and C, but not RhoB, and is a key modulator of RhoA and C in regulating breast cancer cell proliferation and motility. Murine monoclonal antibodies directed against RhoA (sc-418) and tubulin, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-HA and Myc epitopes were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Mammalian expression vectors encoding IQGAP1 with an N-terminal Myc- or Flag epitope tag, and bacterial expression vectors encoding IQGAP-N (amino acids 1–862) or IQGAP-C (863–1657) fused to GST were generated by PCR.

MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and 293T human embryonal kidney cells were from the American Tissue Culture Collection and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Expression vectors encoding Flag-and EE-tagged RhoAV14, RhoBV14, RhoCV14, or empty vector were transfected into 293T cells using calcium phosphate precipitation and 50 μg of DNA per 150-mm dish. After 48 h, cells were lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaHEPES pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min, supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with FLAG M2 affinity gel, and proteins were eluted with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide in lysis buffer. In some cases, proteins were subjected to repeat immunoprecipitation with anti-EE epitope antibody, and eluted with TEV protease prior to analysis by denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE, 7% gel). Proteins were visualized by silver staining using the SilverSNAP Stain Kit II from Pierce/Thermo Scientific. Bands that were uniquely and reproducibly associated with RhoA and C were excised and sent to the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry Facility (mass-spec.stanford.edu) for protein identification by in-gel trypsinization, liquid chromatography, and tandem mass spectrometry. For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Rho with IQGAP1, MDA-MB-231 cells were lysed in the buffer described above, and ∼2 mg of cellular protein was incubated with 6 μg of anti-IQGAP1 antibody. Western blots were developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (32Rangaswami H. Schwappacher R. Marathe N. Zhuang S. Casteel D.E. Haas B.

The other siRNA target sequences were: 5′-AAGTTCTACGGGAAGTAATTG-3′ for IQGAP1; 5′-AAGTCAAGCATTTCTGTCCAA-3′ for RhoA; and 5′-AAGACCTGCCTCCTCATCGTC-3′ for RhoC. The siRNA targeting IQGAP1 was transfected twice 24 h apart; siRNAs targeting RhoA or C were transfected once. Where indicated, cells were infected with adenovirus 6 h after the last siRNA transfection; the multiplicity of infection was titrated to produce amounts of IQGAP1 similar to the amounts of endogenous proteins. For RhoAL63 and RhoCV14, cells were infected with two different viral concentrations sufficient to produce a maximal increase in DNA synthesis or migration, respectively. Two different methods were used to measure Rho activation. To quantify absolute amounts of GTP bound to transfected, epitope-tagged RhoA, or RhoC constructs, we employed a coupled enzymatic assay using nucleoside diphosphate kinase and luciferase as described previously (29Chen J.C.

To determine the activation state of endogenous RhoA or C separately from the other Rho isoforms, we used the Rho binding domain (RBD) of rhotekin to isolate Rho·GTP, and assessed the amount of GTP-bound RhoA or C by Western blotting as described by Ren et al. (30Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. Regulation of the small GTP-binding protein Rho by cell adhesion and the cytoskeleton.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). In some experiments, we assessed the activation state of endogenous RhoA/C using the RBD pull-down assay combined with enzymatic GTP measurements (29Chen J.C. Zhuang S. Nguyen T.H. Boss G.R.

For Transwell migration, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs as described above, and 6 h later, cells were transferred to 0.1% FBS-containing DMEM. Adenoviral vectors were added as indicated, and 24 h later, 1.5 × 105 cells were plated in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin on 8 μm Transwell filters (24 well inserts, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) coated with fibronectin (7.5 μg/ml). The wells below the filters were filled with DMEM containing 10% FBS or 20 ng/ml EGF. After incubation for 12–16 h, cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and stained with Crystal violet. Cells remaining on top of the filter were carefully removed with a cotton swab, and cells migrated to the lower surface of the filter were counted. For a wound-healing assay, cells were transfected as described above, but remained in 10% serum-containing medium and received adenoviral vectors. A scratch was generated 16 h later with a sterile pipette tip, and photographs were taken immediately, and 40 h later. Cells that entered the wound, as defined by the borders on the initial photograph, were counted. MDA-MB-231 cells (1 × 104) were plated on glass cover slips in 24-well dishes; cells were transfected with siRNAs, transferred to medium containing 0.1% FBS, and infected with adenovirus as described for Transwell migration. BrdU (200 μm) was added 24 h later with or without EGF (20 ng/ml) for an additional 16 h. Cells were fixed, stained with anti-BrdU antibody, and counterstained with Hoechst 33342 as described (32Rangaswami H. Schwappacher R. Marathe N. Zhuang S. Casteel D.E. Haas B. Chen Y. Pfeifer A.

At least 300 cells were counted per condition, and results were confirmed by a blinded observer. Bar graphs represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-test analysis. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We performed a proteomics screen in 293T cells transfected with equal amounts of epitope-tagged, constitutively active RhoA, B, and C (all with a glycine to valine mutation at position 14) to search for Rho isoform-specific interacting proteins. By mass spectrometric analysis of bands that were reproducibly and differentially associated with anti-epitope immunoprecipitates of the three Rho proteins, we identified IQGAP1 as a 190 kDa protein associated with RhoA and C, but not with RhoB (Fig. 1A). RhoA- and RhoC-specific association with IQGAP was confirmed in experiments in which the double epitope-tagged Rho proteins were re-immunoprecipitated using an antibody specific for the second epitope, but the protein yield was lower (supplemental Fig. S1A). Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous IQGAP1 with transfected, constitutively active RhoAV14 and RhoCV14, but not RhoBV14 was also confirmed by Western blotting using an IQGAP1-specific antibody, both in 293T cells (Fig. 1B) and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (supplemental Fig. S1B). To determine whether the interaction between RhoA/C and IQGAP1 was direct, and to establish the IQGAP binding region, we incubated Flag-tagged RhoAV14 or RhoCV14 purified from 293T cells with GST-tagged IQGAP-N (amino acids 1–862) or IQGAP-C (amino acids 863–1657) purified from bacteria, with GST serving as a negative control. RhoA and C bound specifically to the C-terminal half, but not the N-terminal half of IQGAP1, whereas RhoB showed no specific binding to either construct (Fig. 1C). These data suggest direct binding of RhoA and C to the C-terminal half of IQGAP1, which contains the GAP-related domain required for CDC42 and Rac binding (20Johnson M. Sharma M. Henderson B.R. IQGAP1 regulation and roles in cancer.Cell Signal. 2009; 21: 1471-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To determine if the RhoA/IQGAP1 interaction was dependent on the activation state of RhoA, we transfected cells with expression vectors encoding Flag-tagged wild type RhoA, constitutively active RhoAV14 and RhoAL63, or dominant-negative RhoAN19. IQGAP1 was strongly associated with RhoAV14 and RhoAL63, but it was barely detectable in immunoprecipi"
https://openalex.org/W2070612932,"The protease α-thrombin is a key enzyme of the coagulation process as it is at the cross-roads of both the pro- and anti-coagulant pathways. The main source of α-thrombin in vivo is the activation of prothrombin by the prothrombinase complex assembled on either an activated cell membrane or cell fragment, the most relevant of which is the activated platelet surface. When prothrombinase is assembled on synthetic phospholipid vesicles, prothrombin activation proceeds with an initial cleavage at Arg-320 yielding the catalytically active, yet effectively anticoagulant intermediate meizothrombin, which is released from the enzyme complex ∼30–40% of the time. Prothrombinase assembled on the surface of activated platelets has been shown to proceed through the inactive intermediate prethrombin-2 via an initial cleavage at Arg-271 followed by cleavage at Arg-320. The current work tests whether or not platelet-associated prothrombinase proceeds via a concerted mechanism through a study of prothrombinase assembly and function on collagen-adhered, thrombin-activated, washed human platelets in a flow chamber. Prothrombinase assembly was demonstrated through visualization of bound factor Xa by confocal microscopy using a fluorophore-labeled anti-factor Xa antibody, which demonstrated the presence of distinct platelet subpopulations capable of binding factor Xa. When prothrombin activation was monitored at a typical venous shear rate over preassembled platelet-associated prothrombinase neither potential intermediate, meizothrombin or prethrombin-2, was observed in the effluent. Collectively, these findings suggest that platelet-associated prothrombinase activates prothrombin via an efficient concerted mechanism in which neither intermediate is released. The protease α-thrombin is a key enzyme of the coagulation process as it is at the cross-roads of both the pro- and anti-coagulant pathways. The main source of α-thrombin in vivo is the activation of prothrombin by the prothrombinase complex assembled on either an activated cell membrane or cell fragment, the most relevant of which is the activated platelet surface. When prothrombinase is assembled on synthetic phospholipid vesicles, prothrombin activation proceeds with an initial cleavage at Arg-320 yielding the catalytically active, yet effectively anticoagulant intermediate meizothrombin, which is released from the enzyme complex ∼30–40% of the time. Prothrombinase assembled on the surface of activated platelets has been shown to proceed through the inactive intermediate prethrombin-2 via an initial cleavage at Arg-271 followed by cleavage at Arg-320. The current work tests whether or not platelet-associated prothrombinase proceeds via a concerted mechanism through a study of prothrombinase assembly and function on collagen-adhered, thrombin-activated, washed human platelets in a flow chamber. Prothrombinase assembly was demonstrated through visualization of bound factor Xa by confocal microscopy using a fluorophore-labeled anti-factor Xa antibody, which demonstrated the presence of distinct platelet subpopulations capable of binding factor Xa. When prothrombin activation was monitored at a typical venous shear rate over preassembled platelet-associated prothrombinase neither potential intermediate, meizothrombin or prethrombin-2, was observed in the effluent. Collectively, these findings suggest that platelet-associated prothrombinase activates prothrombin via an efficient concerted mechanism in which neither intermediate is released. The serine protease α-thrombin (α-fIIa) 4The abbreviations used are: α-fIIaα-thrombinffactorfIIprothrombinmIIameizothrombinPre-2prethrombin-2ATantithrombinPre-2′prethrombin-2 with a deletion of 13 residuesPre-1prethrombin-1F1fragment 1GPglycoproteinDAPAN-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amideRGDSArg-Gly-Asp-Ser peptidePCPSsynthetic phospholipid vesicles containing 75% dioloyl phosphatidylcholine and 25% dioloyl phosphatidylserineHTHEPES Tyrode's BufferHBSHEPES-buffered saline. is a key enzyme in the coagulation process, lying at the cross-roads of the pro- and anti-coagulant pathways. The main source of α-fIIa is the activation of prothrombin (fII) by the prothrombinase complex, which consists of the serine protease factor (f) Xa and the protein cofactor fVa assembled on an appropriate membrane in the presence of Ca2+ (1Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Surface-dependent reactions of the vitamin K-dependent enzyme complexes.Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The prothrombinase complex activates fII 300,000× more efficiently than does uncomplexed fXa in solution. The activation of fII to α-fIIa occurs via two cleavages at Arg-271 and Arg-320 (see Fig. 1). When the prothrombinase complex assembled on synthetic phospholipid vesicles activates fII, the initial cleavage is at Arg-320, leading to the catalytically active intermediate meizothrombin (mIIa) (see Fig. 1, pathway i). When fII is activated by fXa alone in solution or bound to a membrane (1Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Surface-dependent reactions of the vitamin K-dependent enzyme complexes.Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the initial cleavage of fII occurs at Arg-271, leading to the zymogen intermediate prethrombin-2 (Pre-2) (Fig. 1, pathway ii) (2Krishnaswamy S. Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. The prothrombinase-catalyzed activation of prothrombin proceeds through the intermediate meizothrombin in an ordered, sequential reaction.J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8977-8984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both active thrombin species, α-fIIa and mIIa, can also carry out feedback cleavages at Arg-155 and Arg-284. Cleavage at Arg-155 leads to the loss of fragment 1 (F1), resulting in the formation of prethrombin-1 (Pre-1) and mIIa (des F1) from fII and mIIa, respectively. Cleavage at Arg-284 results in the formation of Pre-2 with a deletion of 13 residues at the N terminus (Pre-2′) (3Downing M.R. Butkowski R.J. Clark M.M. Mann K.G. Human prothrombin activation.J.

The primary biological surface for prothrombinase assembly is that of the activated platelet. A recent study by Wood et al. (5Wood J.P. Silveira J.R. Maille N.M. Haynes L.M. Tracy P.B. Prothrombin activation on the activated platelet surface optimizes expression of procoagulant activity.Blood. 2011; 117: 1710-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) reported that when the prothrombinase complex is assembled on the activated platelet surface, the activation of fII proceeds via the Pre-2 pathway without the presence of the mIIa intermediate. Furthermore, this study showed preferential cleavage at Arg-271 by platelet-associated prothrombinase versus Arg-320, the preferred initial cleavage site of prothrombinase assembled on synthetic phospholipid vesicles. An additional report by Fager et al. (6Fager A.M. Tracy P.B. Everse S.J. Unique structural models of prothrombinase assembled on the activated platelet membrane.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2009; 7: 198aPubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the structure of platelet-associated prothrombinase differs from that assembled on the surface of synthetic phospholipid vesicles, which may explain the differences in reaction pathways between the two systems. Some of these structural differences may arise from the presence of specific fVa and fXa receptors on the activated platelet surface, unlike synthetic phospholipid vesicles (7Tracy P.B. Nesheim M.E.

Furthermore, fXa cannot bind to the activated platelet surface in the absence of the cofactor fVa (7Tracy P.B. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G.

Platelets are essential to both primary and secondary hemostasis, whereupon vascular injury exposes the subendothelium and a number of platelet recruiting agents, including fibronectin, collagen, and von Willebrand factor (14Beumer S.

At low shear rates, such as those present in the venous system, platelets are recruited to collagen directly, through their glycoprotein VI and integrin α2β1 receptors (15Hathcock J.J.

In addition to being vital for direct platelet adhesion to collagen, the glycoprotein VI receptor also serves as an important activator of platelets (19Brass L.F. Thrombin and platelet activation.Chest. 2003; 124: 18S-25SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Under high shear conditions, platelet adhesion to collagen is initiated by von Willebrand factor-mediated interactions with the αIIbβ3 integrin of the platelet and the GPIαβ subunit of the GPIb-IX-V receptor, leading to shear induced platelet activation (20Ruggeri Z.M.

We have recently demonstrated the production of the catalytically active intermediate mIIa using a flow reactor when the prothrombinase complex was assembled on a supported phospholipid bilayer consisting of 75% dioleoyl phosphotidylcholine (PC) and 25% dioleoyl phosphotidylserine (PS) (23Haynes L.M. Dubief Y.C. Orfeo T. Mann K.G. Dilutional control of prothrombin activation at physiologically relevant shear rates.Biophys. J. 2011; 100: 765-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Forty percent of the thrombin species observed in the effluent consisted of mIIa, in agreement with previous work (24Billy D. Briedé J. Heemskerk J.W. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. Prothrombin conversion under flow conditions by prothrombinase assembled on adherent platelets.Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1997; 8: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This finding may be interpreted in one of two ways. 1) The activation of fII by the prothrombinase complex assembled on a synthetic phospholipid bilayer is accomplished by two successive cleavages by different prothrombinase complexes, where only 60% of the mIIa produced by the first cleavage is able to find a second prothrombinase complex where it is fully activated to α-fIIa before exiting the catalytically active reactor. 2) fII is activated by a single prothrombinase complex, which only completes the second cleavage of fII to form α-fIIa 60% of the time, whereas 40% of the time the intermediate mIIa dissociates before being fully activated. Although a previous study by Billy et al. (24Billy D. Briedé J. Heemskerk J.W. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. Prothrombin conversion under flow conditions by prothrombinase assembled on adherent platelets.Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1997; 8: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) investigated the activation of fII by prothrombinase assembled on activated platelets under flow, it did not take advantage of the system to address the question of the reaction pathway nor its mechanism. In the current study, a flow chamber in which prothrombinase is assembled on the surface of activated platelets or a supported phospholipid bilayer is utilized to determine if the mechanism of prothrombin activation occurs via one of three catalytic processes: 1) a concerted reaction in which fII is efficiently activated to α-fIIa by a single prothrombinase complex through either the mIIa or Pre-2 pathway; 2) an inefficient reaction in which cleavage at Arg-271 is carried out by one prothrombinase complex leading to the release of the non-catalytically active Pre-2, followed by its complete activation by a second prothrombinase complex; and 3) an inefficient reaction that proceeds through the mIIa pathway, analogous to the pathway observed on synthetic phospholipid vesicles. Thus, we propose that the use of a flow reactor will help to determine the mechanism by which fII is activated by prothrombinase assembled on the surface of activated platelets.

Washed platelets were counted using a pocH-100i from Sysmex (Kobe, Japan) or a Coulter Z1 particle counter (Beckman Coulter). Washed platelets (3 × 108 ml−1) were activated with α-fIIa (50 nm) in the presence of 3 mm RGDS for 5 min in HT. The reaction was stopped by the addition of hirudin (75 nm). The prothrombinase complex was assembled by incubating fVa (20 nm) and fXa (0.2 nm) with either PCPS vesicles (20 μm) or washed human platelets (1 × 108 ml−1) for 5 min in HEPES-buffered saline (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4; HBS) containing 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG) and 2 mm Ca2+ or HT, respectively. The prothrombinase reaction was initiated with the addition of fII (1.4 μm). At 30-s, 60-s, 90-s, 2-min, 5-min, 10-min, and 20-min time points, the reaction mixtures were quenched with Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (6 μm) and prepared for subsequent analysis by Western blotting. Samples for Western blotting were prepared in sample preparation buffer (62 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 0.08% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), reduced with 5–10% β-mercaptoethanol, analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10% gels from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland), and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting analysis. A polyclonal burro-α-human prethrombin-1 primary antibody was used to detect prothrombin fragments. Blots were developed using a LAS4000 from Fuji. Plasma cleaned capillaries were coated overnight with 0.5 mg/ml collagen diluted in 5% dextrose (pH 2.7). The capillaries were rinsed with HT for 5 min at a shear rate of 100 s−1, before a platelet-associated prothrombinase solution (1 ml) containing thrombin-activated platelets (1 × 108 ml−1), fVa (20 nm), and fXa (0.2 nm) was incubated at room temperature for 5 min and subsequently flowed over the capillary at a shear rate of 100 s−1. A solution of fII (1.4 μm) and DAPA (500 nm) in HT was flowed over the capillary at 100 s−1, and the effluent was collected dropwise (∼23 μl) into HBS containing 0.1% PEG and 20 mm EDTA to stop further Ca2+-dependent reactions prior to determining the concentration of active thrombin species with a chromogenic assay. For fluorogenic assays to determine the presence of mIIa, the effluent (2 ml) was collected without further treatment. Plasma-cleaned capillaries were incubated for 1 h with PCPS (100 μm) in HBS containing 2 mm Ca2+ at 4 °C to assemble a phospholipid bilayer as described previously (23Haynes L.M. Dubief Y.C. Orfeo T.

Prothrombinase was assembled on PCPS and collagen-adhered, platelet-coated capillaries as described above, with the exception that 1 nm fXa was limiting to the assembly of prothrombinase. Effluent was collected and assayed as described above until a steady-state level of active thrombin species generation was obtained. The effluent was further collected (5 ml) into hirudin present at an approximate 10 nm excess over active thrombin species. After collection, the effluent was acetone precipitated, solubilized in sample preparation buffer, and reduced with 5–10% β-mercaptoethanol for analysis by SDS-PAGE on a 5–15% gradient gel followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Cleavage products were identified by mobility and comparison with fII fragment standards. After reactants were washed from the capillaries for 5 min at 100 s−1 with HT, platelets were subjected to fixation by rinsing with 2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 100 s−1 and incubated for 20 min undisturbed. Paraformaldehyde was removed from the capillary by rinsing for 5 min at 100 s−1 with double distilled H2O, and capillaries were stored overnight in double distilled H2O at 4 °C. Platelets were immunostained with CD62 conjugated to phycoerythrin and α-fX-27-5 conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 for 30 min. Platelet coated capillaries were washed three times via capillary action with 2.7 mm KCl and 137 mm NaCl at pH 7.4, mounted to a microscope slide and visualized using a Zeiss 510 META confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss MicroImaging, Thornwood, NY) with immersion"
https://openalex.org/W1980079347,"Malaria parasites generate vast quantities of heme during blood stage infection via hemoglobin digestion and limited de novo biosynthesis, but it remains unclear if parasites metabolize heme for utilization or disposal. Recent in vitro experiments with a heme oxygenase (HO)-like protein from Plasmodium falciparum suggested that parasites may enzymatically degrade some heme to the canonical HO product, biliverdin (BV), or its downstream metabolite, bilirubin (BR). To directly test for BV and BR production by P. falciparum parasites, we DMSO-extracted equal numbers of infected and uninfected erythrocytes and developed a sensitive LC-MS/MS assay to quantify these tetrapyrroles. We found comparable low levels of BV and BR in both samples, suggesting the absence of HO activity in parasites. We further tested live parasites by targeted expression of a fluorescent BV-binding protein within the parasite cytosol, mitochondrion, and plant-like plastid. This probe could detect exogenously added BV but gave no signal indicative of endogenous BV production within parasites. Finally, we recombinantly expressed and tested the proposed heme degrading activity of the HO-like protein, PfHO. Although PfHO bound heme and protoporphyrin IX with modest affinity, it did not catalyze heme degradation in vivo within bacteria or in vitro in UV absorbance and HPLC assays. These observations are consistent with PfHO's lack of a heme-coordinating His residue and suggest an alternative function within parasites. We conclude that P. falciparum parasites lack a canonical HO pathway for heme degradation and thus rely fully on alternative mechanisms for heme detoxification and iron acquisition during blood stage infection."
https://openalex.org/W2018473067,"Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is the predominant triacylglycerol (TAG) hydrolase in mammals; however, the tissue-specific effects of ATGL outside of adipose tissue have not been well characterized. Hence, we tested the contribution of hepatic ATGL on mediating glucose tolerance and insulin action. Glucose or insulin tolerance tests and insulin signaling were performed in C57BL/6 mice administered control (nongene specific shRNA) or Atgl shRNA adenoviruses. Glucose and lipid metabolism assays were conducted in primary hepatocytes isolated from mice transduced with control or Atgl shRNA adenoviruses. Knocking down hepatic ATGL completely abrogated the increase in serum insulin following either 1 or 12 wk of feeding a high-fat (HF) diet despite higher hepatic TAG content. Glucose tolerance tests demonstrated that ATGL knockdown normalized glucose tolerance in HF-diet-fed mice. The observed improvements in glucose tolerance were present despite unaltered hepatic insulin signaling and increased liver TAG. Mice with suppressed hepatic ATGL had reduced hepatic glucose production in vivo, and hepatocytes isolated from Atgl shRNA-treated mice displayed a 26% decrease in glucose production and a 38% increase in glucose oxidation compared to control cells. Taken together, these data suggest that hepatic ATGL knockdown enhances glucose tolerance by increasing hepatic glucose utilization and uncouples impairments in insulin action from hepatic TAG accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2071746920,"The proteasome is the central machinery for targeted protein degradation in archaea, Actinobacteria, and eukaryotes. In its basic form, it consists of a regulatory ATPase complex and a proteolytic core particle. The interaction between the two is governed by an HbYX motif (where Hb is a hydrophobic residue, Y is tyrosine, and X is any amino acid) at the C terminus of the ATPase subunits, which stimulates gate opening of the proteasomal α-subunits. In archaea, the proteasome-interacting motif is not only found in canonical proteasome-activating nucleotidases of the PAN/ARC/Rpt group, which are absent in major archaeal lineages, but also in proteins of the CDC48/p97/VAT and AMA groups, suggesting a regulatory network of proteasomal ATPases. Indeed, Thermoplasma acidophilum, which lacks PAN, encodes one CDC48 protein that interacts with the 20S proteasome and activates the degradation of model substrates. In contrast, Methanosarcina mazei contains seven AAA proteins, five of which, both PAN proteins, two out of three CDC48 proteins, and the AMA protein, function as proteasomal gatekeepers. The prevalent presence of multiple, distinct proteasomal ATPases in archaea thus results in a network of regulatory ATPases that may widen the substrate spectrum of proteasomal protein degradation."

The removal of 8-oxoG by OGG1 is affected by the local DNA sequence, and this feature most likely contributes to observed mutational hot spots in genomic DNA. To elucidate the influence of local DNA sequence on 8-oxoG excision activity of OGG1, we conducted steady-state, pre-steady-state, and single turnover kinetic evaluation of OGG1 in alternate DNA sequence contexts. The sequence context effect was studied for a mutational hot spot at a CpG dinucleotide. Altering either the global DNA sequence or the 5′-flanking unmodified base pair failed to influence the excision of 8-oxoG. Methylation of the cytosine 5′ to 8-oxoG also did not affect 8-oxoG excision. In contrast, a 5′-neighboring mismatch strongly decreased the rate of 8-oxoG base removal. Substituting the 5′-C in the CpG dinucleotide with T, A, or tetrahydrofuran (i.e. T:G, A:G, and tetrahydrofuran:G mispairs) resulted in a 10-, 13-, and 4-fold decrease in the rate constant for 8-oxoG excision, respectively. A greater loss in activity was observed when T:C or A:C was positioned 5′ of 8-oxoG (59- and 108-fold, respectively).

https://openalex.org/W1966500680,"Ubiquitin conjugation provides a crucial signaling role in hundreds of cellular pathways; however, a structural understanding of ubiquitinated substrates is lacking. One important substrate is monoubiquitinated PCNA (PCNA-Ub), which signals for recruitment of damage-tolerant polymerases in the translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway of DNA damage avoidance. We use a novel and efficient enzymatic method to produce PCNA-Ub at high yield with a native isopeptide bond and study its Usp1/UAF1-dependent deconjugation. In solution we find that the ubiquitin moiety is flexible relative to the PCNA, with its hydrophobic patch mostly accessible for recruitment of TLS polymerases, which promotes the interaction with polymerase η. The studies are a prototype for the nature of the ubiquitin modification."

https://openalex.org/W1973977374,"Pompe disease has resisted enzyme replacement therapy with acid α-glucosidase (GAA), which has been attributed to inefficient cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) mediated uptake. We evaluated β2-agonist drugs, which increased CI-MPR expression in GAA knockout (KO) mice. Clenbuterol along with a low-dose adeno-associated virus vector increased Rotarod latency by 75% at 4 wk, in comparison with vector alone (P<2×10(-5)). Glycogen content was lower in skeletal muscles, including soleus (P<0.01), extensor digitorum longus (EDL; P<0.001), and tibialis anterior (P<0.05) following combination therapy, in comparison with vector alone. Glycogen remained elevated in the muscles following clenbuterol alone, indicating an adjunctive effect with gene therapy. Elderly GAA-KO mice treated with combination therapy demonstrated 2-fold increased wirehang latency, in comparison with vector or clenbuterol alone (P<0.001). The glycogen content of skeletal muscle decreased following combination therapy in elderly mice (P<0.05). Finally, CI-MPR-KO/GAA-KO mice did not respond to combination therapy, indicating that clenbuterol's effect depended on CI-MPR expression. In summary, adjunctive β2-agonist treatment increased CI-MPR expression and enhanced efficacy from gene therapy in Pompe disease, which has implications for other lysosomal storage disorders that involve primarily the brain."

This study reveals a novel use of gemfibrozil and fenofibrate, Food and Drug Administration-approved lipid-lowering drugs, in up-regulating TPP1 in brain cells. Both gemfibrozil and fenofibrate up-regulated mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity of TPP1 in primary mouse neurons and astrocytes as well as human astrocytes and neuronal cells.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors have increased microvascular density, localized hypoxia, and high VEGF expression levels; however, there is a lack of understanding of how oncogenic and tumor microenvironment changes such as hypoxia lead to greater VEGF expression in lung and other cancers. We show that NSCLC cells secreted higher levels of VEGF than normal airway epithelial cells. Actinomycin D inhibited all NSCLC VEGF secretion, and VEGF minimal promoter-luciferase reporter constructs were constitutively active until the last 85 base pairs before the transcription start site containing three SP-1 transcription factor-binding sites; mutation of these VEGF promoter SP-1-binding sites eliminated VEGF promoter activity. Furthermore, dominant negative SP-1, mithramycin A, and SP-1 shRNA decreased VEGF promoter activity, whereas overexpression of SP-1 increased VEGF promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated SP-1, p300, and PCA/F histone acetyltransferase binding and histone H4 hyperacetylation at the VEGF promoter in NSCLC cells.

https://openalex.org/W1985934608,"We identified Certhrax, the first anthrax-like mART toxin from the pathogenic G9241 strain of Bacillus cereus. Certhrax shares 31% sequence identity with anthrax lethal factor from Bacillus anthracis; however, we have shown that the toxicity of Certhrax resides in the mART domain, whereas anthrax uses a metalloprotease mechanism. Like anthrax lethal factor, Certhrax was found to require protective antigen for host cell entry. This two-domain enzyme was shown to be 60-fold more toxic to mammalian cells than anthrax lethal factor. Certhrax localizes to distinct regions within mouse RAW264.7 cells by 10 min postinfection and is extranuclear in its cellular location. Substitution of catalytic residues shows that the mART function is responsible for the toxicity, and it binds NAD(+) with high affinity (K(D) = 52.3 ± 12.2 μM). We report the 2.2 Å Certhrax structure, highlighting its structural similarities and differences with anthrax lethal factor. We also determined the crystal structures of two good inhibitors (P6 (K(D) = 1.7 ± 0.2 μM, K(i) = 1.8 ± 0.4 μM) and PJ34 (K(D) = 5.8 ± 2.6 μM, K(i) = 9.6 ± 0.3 μM)) in complex with Certhrax.

https://openalex.org/W2089628102,"Activation of hepatic cannabinoid 1 receptor (Cb1r) signaling has been implicated in the development of phenotypes associated with fatty liver, hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance. In the current study, we have elucidated the critical role of endoplasmic reticulum-bound transcription factor cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein H (Crebh) in mediating activated Cb1r signaling in inducing phosphatidic acid phosphatase Lipin1 gene expression and subsequently deregulating hepatic insulin receptor signaling. Cb1r agonist (2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)) treatment induced Lipin1 gene expression in a Crebh-dependent manner via recruiting CREBH to the endogenous Lipin1 gene promoter. Adenoviral overexpression of Crebh or 2-AG treatment in mice induced Lipin1 gene expression to increase the hepatic diacylglycerol (DAG) level and phosphorylation of protein kinase Cε (PKCε). This in turn inhibited hepatic insulin receptor signaling. Knockdown of Crebh or Cb1r antagonism attenuated 2-AG-mediated induction of Lipin1 gene expression and decreased DAG production in mouse liver and subsequently restored insulin receptor signaling. Similarly, knockdown of Lipin1 attenuated the 2-AG-induced increase in the DAG level and PKCε phosphorylation. Finally, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Crebh partially but significantly blunted Lipin1 expression and the DAG level in db/db mice. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which Cb1r signaling induces Lipin1 gene expression and increases DAG production by activating Crebh, thereby deregulating insulin receptor signaling pathway and lipid homeostasis."

Here, we investigated whether antibody synthesis is affected when animal development occurs onboard a space station. To answer this question, embryos of the Iberian ribbed newt, Pleurodeles waltl, were sent to the International Space Station (ISS) before the initiation of immunoglobulin heavy-chain expression. Thus, antibody synthesis began in space. On landing, we determined the effects of spaceflight on P. waltl development and IgM heavy-chain transcription. Results were compared with those obtained using embryos that developed on Earth. We find that IgM heavy-chain transcription is doubled at landing and that spaceflight does not affect P. waltl development and does not induce inflammation. We also recreated the environmental modifications encountered by the embryos during their development onboard the ISS. This strategy allowed us to demonstrate that gravity change is the factor responsible for antibody heavy-chain transcription modifications that are associated with NF-κB mRNA level variations. Taken together, and given that the larvae were not immunized, these data suggest a modification of lymphopoiesis when gravity changes occur during ontogeny.—Huin-Schohn, C., Guéguinou, N., Schenten, V., Bascove, M., Koch, G.

Key to these potential applications is their high potency and species specificity that enables a single pathogenic species to be targeted with minimal disturbance of the wider microbial community. Here we present the structure and function of the colicin M-like bacteriocin, syringacin M from Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. Syringacin M kills susceptible cells through a highly specific phosphatase activity that targets lipid II, ultimately inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis. Comparison of the structures of syringacin M and colicin M reveals that, in addition to the expected similarity between the homologous C-terminal catalytic domains, the receptor binding domains of these proteins, which share no discernible sequence homology, share a striking structural similarity. This indicates that the generation of the novel receptor binding and species specificities of these bacteriocins has been driven by diversifying selection rather than diversifying recombination as suggested previously. Additionally, the structure of syringacin M reveals the presence of an active site calcium ion that is coordinated by a conserved aspartic acid side chain and is essential for catalytic activity. We show that mutation of this residue to alanine inactivates syringacin M and that the metal ion is absent from the structure of the mutant protein. Consistent with the presence of Ca(2+) in the active site, we show that syringacin M activity is supported by Ca(2+), along with Mg(2+) and Mn(2+), and the protein is catalytically inactive in the absence of these ions."
https://openalex.org/W2033119599,"Human and mouse type I natural killer T (NKT) cells respond to a variety of CD1d-restricted glycolipid antigens (Ags), with their NKT cell antigen receptors (NKT TCRs) exhibiting reciprocal cross-species reactivity that is underpinned by a conserved NKT TCR-CD1d-Ag docking mode. Within this common docking footprint, the NKT TCR recognizes, to varying degrees of affinity, a range of Ags. Presently, it is unclear whether the human NKT TCRs will mirror the generalities underpinning the fine specificity of the mouse NKT TCR-CD1d-Ag interaction. Here, we assessed human NKT TCR recognition against altered glycolipid ligands of α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) and have determined the structures of a human NKT TCR in complex with CD1d-4',4″-deoxy-α-GalCer and CD1d-α-GalCer with a shorter, di-unsaturated acyl chain (C20:2). Altered glycolipid ligands with acyl chain modifications did not affect the affinity of the human NKT TCR-CD1d-Ag interaction. Surprisingly, human NKT TCR recognition is more tolerant to modifications at the 4'-OH position in comparison with the 3'-OH position of α-GalCer, which contrasts the fine specificity of the mouse NKT TCR-CD1d-Ag recognition (4'-OH > 3'-OH). The fine specificity differences between human and mouse NKT TCRs was attributable to differing interactions between the respective complementarity-determining region 1α loops and the Ag. Accordingly, germline encoded fine-specificity differences underpin human and mouse type I NKT TCR interactions, which is an important consideration for therapeutic development and NKT cell physiology."

Multiple studies have highlighted the importance of SBP2 forming a complex with the SECIS element, but it is not clear how this regulates eEFSec during Sec incorporation. Compared with the canonical elongation factor eEF1A, eEFSec has a unique C-terminal extension called Domain IV. To understand the role of Domain IV in Sec incorporation, we examined a series of mutant proteins for all of the known molecular functions for eEFSec: GTP hydrolysis, Sec-tRNASec binding, and SBP2/SECIS binding. In addition, wild-type and mutant versions of eEFSec were analyzed for Sec incorporation activity in a novel eEFSec-dependent translation extract. We have found that Domain IV is essential for both tRNA and SBP2 binding as well as regulating GTPase activity. We propose a model where the SBP2/SECIS complex activates eEFSec by directing functional interactions between Domain IV and the ribosome to promote Sec-tRNASec binding and accommodation into the ribosomal A-site.

Compared with the canonical elongation factor eEF1A, eEFSec has a unique C-terminal extension called Domain IV. To understand the role of Domain IV in Sec incorporation, we examined a series of mutant proteins for all of the known molecular functions for eEFSec: GTP hydrolysis, Sec-tRNASec binding, and SBP2/SECIS binding. In addition, wild-type and mutant versions of eEFSec were analyzed for Sec incorporation activity in a novel eEFSec-dependent translation extract. We have found that Domain IV is essential for both tRNA and SBP2 binding as well as regulating GTPase activity. We propose a model where the SBP2/SECIS complex activates eEFSec by directing functional interactions between Domain IV and the ribosome to promote Sec-tRNASec binding and accommodation into the ribosomal A-site. The amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) 2The abbreviations used are: SecselenocysteineeEFSeceukaryotic elongation factor for selenocysteineSECISSec insertion sequenceSBP2SECIS-binding protein 2bSECISbacterial SECISRBDRNA-binding domainSIDSec incorporation domainaaamino acidXHXpress/His. is incorporated into a small group of proteins that are involved in preventing cellular oxidative stress, which has been implicated in several human pathologies such as cancer, cardiomyopathy, osteoarthritis, and neurodegeneration (1Steinbrenner H. Sies H. Protection against reactive oxygen species by selenoproteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 1478-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The incorporation of Sec is unique because it requires the recoding of UGA from a stop codon to one that specifies Sec. This recoding event is dependent on a stem-loop structure found at the 3′ untranslated region called the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element. The proposed function of the SECIS element is to form a complex with two essential trans-acting factors: the SECIS-binding protein 2 (SBP2) and the Sec-specific eukaryotic elongation factor (eEFSec). However, it remains unresolved how SBP2 and the SECIS element activate eEFSec for the insertion of Sec into nascent peptides. selenocysteine eukaryotic elongation factor for selenocysteine Sec insertion sequence SECIS-binding protein 2 bacterial SECIS RNA-binding domain Sec incorporation domain amino acid Xpress/His. The elongation factor eEFSec is a GTP-binding protein with similar affinity to GDP, thus it likely does not require a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (2Tujebajeva R.M. Copeland P.R. Xu X.M.

As for its tRNA-binding properties, eEFSec can only interact with Sec-tRNASec, but not the serylated-tRNASec precursor or the canonical aminoacyl-tRNAs (2Tujebajeva R.M. Copeland P.R. Xu X.M.

The crystal structure of archaeal EFSec revealed a “chalice-like” structure consisting of Domains I, II, and III forming the cup of the chalice, with a unique fourth domain that is separated from the first three (4Leibundgut M. Frick C. Thanbichler M. Böck A. Ban N. Selenocysteine tRNA-specific elongation factor SelB is a structural chimaera of elongation and initiation factors.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The function of each eEFSec domain remains untested, but based on sequence conservation, the first three domains in eEFSec may have properties similar to the canonical eukaryotic translation elongation factor, eEF1A, which itself is composed of three domains. Domain I is required for GTPase activity and ribosome interactions. Domain II is mainly involved in aminoacyl-tRNA binding, and Domain III is proposed to be involved in interactions with the T arm of aminoacyl-tRNAs (5Noble C.G. Song H. Structural studies of elongation and release factors.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 1335-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The function of Domain IV in eEFSec is not well understood. In bacteria, Sec incorporation is achieved by functional interactions between the bacterial SECIS (bSECIS) and SelB, the bacterial homolog of eEFSec. Physical contacts of this complex were mapped to the apical loop of the bSECIS and the C terminus of Domain IV (6Yoshizawa S. Rasubala L. Ose T. Kohda D. Fourmy D. Maenaka K. Structural basis for mRNA recognition by elongation factor SelB.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mutations in the apical loop of bSECIS or deletion of Domain IV in SelB abolished the interaction of these two factors and, as a consequence, depleted Sec incorporation activity (7Baron C. Heider J. Böck A. Interaction of translation factor SELB with the formate dehydrogenase H selenopolypeptide mRNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 4181-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Ezure T. Suzuki T. Higashide S. Shintani E. Endo K. Kobayashi S. Shikata M. Ito M. Tanimizu K. Nishimura O. Cell-free protein synthesis system prepared from insect cells by freeze-thawing.Biotechnol. Prog. 2006; 22: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The simple model for eukaryotic Sec incorporation is that a SBP2/SECIS/eEFSec/GTP/Sec-tRNASec complex is required for delivery of Sec-tRNASec to the A-site of the ribosome. However, the existence of this complex has not been verified, and a physical interaction between eEFSec and SBP2 is highly condition-dependent. eEFSec and SBP2 were first demonstrated to interact by a co-immunoprecipitation experiment in transiently transfected mammalian cells, forming a complex that was RNase-sensitive (2Tujebajeva R.M. Copeland P.R. Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Harney J.W. Driscoll D.M. Hatfield D.L. Berry M.J. Decoding apparatus for eukaryotic selenocysteine insertion.EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Further studies, also in transiently transfected mammalian cells, showed that eEFSec and SBP2 interactions were enhanced by overexpression of the tRNASec gene (9Zavacki A.M. Mansell J.B. Chung M.

Cell. 2003; 11: 773-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, however, the two factors could not be co-immunoprecipitated from rabbit reticulocyte lysate, despite this being an active Sec incorporation system. In contrast, a native electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that eEFSec can form a complex with SBP2 in the presence of a SECIS element without the requirement of Sec-tRNASec (10Donovan J. Caban K. Ranaweera R. Gonzalez-Flores J.N. Copeland P.R. A novel protein domain induces high affinity selenocysteine insertion sequence binding and elongation factor recruitment.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35129-35139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This study also showed that the RNA-binding domain (RBD) of SBP2 and the SECIS element are sufficient for eEFSec recruitment. This suggests that the RBD of SBP2 and the SECIS element may together create a binding interface that is favorable for eEFSec interaction. Overall, it is clear that the eEFSec/SBP2 interaction is not highly stable and likely consists of several intermediate conformations. In this study, we provide a thorough examination of eEFSec-Domain IV for Sec incorporation, SBP2/SECIS binding, Sec-tRNASec binding, and GTPase activity. Our results have revealed that Domain IV of eEFSec is required for Sec incorporation by being involved in Sec-tRNASec binding, GTPase regulation, and interactions with SBP2 in a SECIS-dependent manner. The coding region of murine eEFSec (gift of M. Berry, University of Hawaii) was amplified with a 5′ primer that included the FLAG tag sequence, and the product was TA cloned into pTrcHis2 (Invitrogen). Penta-alanine mutants at Domain IV of eEFSec were created with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The construct of FLAG-eEFSec without Domain IV (aa 1–440) was PCR-amplified and TA-cloned into pTrcHis2. FLAG-eEF1A was created with the rat coding region and prepared as the eEFSec constructs. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. SBP2 constructs were made as described previously (10Donovan J. Caban K. Ranaweera R. Gonzalez-Flores J.N. Copeland P.R.

Biol. 2007; 27: 6350-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recombinant Xpress/His-tagged C-terminal SBP2 (XH-CTSBP2) was purified as described previously (12Kinzy S.A. Caban K. Copeland P.R. Characterization of the SECIS binding protein 2 complex required for the co-translational insertion of selenocysteine in mammals.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5172-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All of our FLAG-eEFSec and eEF1A recombinant proteins were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli BL21. The transformed bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin to a density of ∼1.0 A600. Induction was performed with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 12–16 h at 18 °C. Each liter of cell culture was pelleted and resuspended in 40 ml of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Tween, and 0.5 mm PMSF). Solutions were sonicated four times at 2 s/ml with 1–2-min resting periods on ice and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Purification was performed by incubating 1 ml of anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (Sigma-Aldrich) with a total of 80 ml of protein extract, in 40-ml aliquots, for 2 h each at 4 °C. After the binding step, the beads were washed 5 times with Buffer A without PMSF followed by 5 times with Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 25% glycerol). Elution was done in 1 ml of Buffer B with 250 μg/ml 3× FLAG peptide for 30 min at 4 °C. Purified protein fractions were concentrated with Amicon Ultra 30K, brought to 1 mm DTT, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The FLAG purification method yielded ∼0.25 mg of purified wild-type eEFSec and ∼0.05 mg of recombinant eEF1A and Domain IV mutant proteins per liter of bacterial culture. Sec incorporation activity in cell-free extracts was measured with a luciferase mRNA reporter containing a UGA-Sec codon at position 258 of the coding region and the rat GPX4 SECIS element at the 3′ untranslated region (13Mehta A. Rebsch C.M. Kinzy S.A. Fletcher J.E. Copeland P.R. Efficiency of mammalian selenocysteine incorporation.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37852-37859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter was also used to measure the translation activity by having an UGU-Cys codon instead of the UGA-Sec codon. Insect cell extract (Promega) made from Sf21 cells was used for our in vitro translation reactions according to the manufacturer's protocol. PC-3 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 50 nm sodium selenite for 7 days. Cells were scraped in translation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.4 mm GTP, 0.25 mm spermidine, 20% glycerol, and Roche EDTA-free protease inhibitors) and lysed by passing them through a 30½-gauge syringe needle. Cellular lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 17,000 × g, and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The in vitro translation assays were 12.5-μl reactions that contained 5.5 μl each of Sf21 and PC-3 lysates, 100 ng of luciferase mRNA reporter, and 160 nm SBP2 and wild-type or mutant eEFSec recombinant protein. Translation and Sec incorporation reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C and measured for luminescence in a 96-well plate luminometer (Berthold TriStar). EMSA experiments were carried out as described but with the following modifications (10Donovan J. Caban K. Ranaweera R. Gonzalez-Flores J.N. Copeland P.R. A novel protein domain induces high affinity selenocysteine insertion sequence binding and elongation factor recruitment.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35129-35139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled GPX4 SECIS probe was heated for 3 min at 95 °C and cooled down to 25 °C for 5 min. Probe was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with the indicated proteins in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm GTP, 10 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 250 ng/μl bovine tRNA, and 52.5 ng/μl soy trypsin inhibitor). Complexes were resolved in 6% acrylamide Tris-glycine gels and analyzed by phosphoimaging. UV cross-linking experiments were performed in conditions described above for EMSA. Reactions were cross-linked for 15 min in Spectrolinker XL-1000 (Spectronics), followed by RNase A treatment for 15 min at 30 °C. Samples were separated in 12% SDS gels and visualized by phosphoimaging. Sec-tRNASec was radiolabeled with 50 nm Na2[75Se]O3 (926 Ci/g, Missouri University Research Reactor) in 10 ml of crude rabbit reticulocyte (Green Hectares) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Incubation was followed by adding 6 ml of H2O, 4 ml of 5× Buffer T (50 mm NaOAc, 3.25 m NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm EDTA), and 20 ml of phenol, pH 4. The solution was briefly vortexed and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was transferred to another tube and re-extracted with one volume of phenol, pH 4 to remove remaining protein contamination. RNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol and stored at −80 °C for 5 min. RNA was pelleted at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 800 μl of 1× Buffer T. RNA was re-pelleted by ethanol precipitation, washed once with 70% ethanol, and air-dried for 10 min. Pellet was resuspended in aa-tRNA storage solution (5 mm NaOAc, pH 4.5 and 2 mm DTT), aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Agarose gel analysis showed little or no ribosomal RNA contamination in our aa-tRNA preparations. [75Se]Sec-tRNASec was quantified by liquid scintillation counting and yielded ∼300 cpm per μg of total aa-tRNA. Sec-tRNASec integrity was examined by acid urea gel electrophoresis (14Köhrer C. Rajbhandary U.L. The many applications of acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to studies of tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.Methods. 2008; 44: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) followed by PhosphorImager analysis. Binding reactions (20 μl) were performed in Buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.25 mm MgCl2 0.5 mm GTP, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol), 33 μg of aa-tRNA containing 10,000 cpm of [75Se]Sec-tRNASec, and 1 μm eEFSec for 30 min at 30 °C. After incubation, samples were pipetted onto nitrocellulose filters (Millipore 0.45-μm HA) that were prewashed with translation buffer. Samples were washed three times with 500 μl of Buffer C on a Millipore vacuum manifold. Membrane filters were air-dried and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. GTP hydrolysis activity was measured by using a colorimetric GTPase assay kit (Innova Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reactions were assayed in Buffer C and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. FLAG-eEF1A, FLAG-eEFSec, XH-CTSBP2, and the SECIS element were each added at a final concentration of 1 μm. Isolation of total aa-tRNA was performed as above but without the addition of Na2[75Se]O3. Purification of salt washed 80 S ribosomes from rabbit reticulocyte was performed as described (15Caban K. Copeland P.R. Selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS)-binding protein 2 alters conformational dynamics of residues involved in tRNA accommodation in 80 S ribosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 10664-10673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Concentrations of total aa-tRNA and ribosomes in the GTPase activation reactions were at 100 ng/μl and 0.12 μm, respectively. Measurements of the hydrolyzed free phosphate were performed at a wavelength of 600 nm, and absorbance values were compared with a standard curve to determine the free phosphate concentration. The development of a functional assay to study eEFSec for Sec incorporation has remained one of the hurdles in the field. The addition of recombinant His-tagged eEFSec to rabbit reticulocyte lysate, a system limiting for SBP2, did not increase Sec incorporation activity (13Mehta A. Rebsch C.M. Kinzy S.A. Fletcher J.E. Copeland P.R. Efficiency of mammalian selenocysteine incorporation.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37852-37859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Efforts to deplete eEFSec from reticulocyte lysate by immunoprecipitation have also been unsuccessful (data not shown). Because translationally competent lysates from mammalian cells are generally inefficient, we sought to provide general translation factors from a robust in vitro translation system that lacks Sec incorporation factors. Genomic in silico analysis indicates that the organisms in the Lepidopteran order, including the Spodoptera genus, do not possess selenoproteins and are missing Sec incorporation machinery (16Donovan J. Copeland P.R. Evolutionary history of selenocysteine incorporation from the perspective of SECIS-binding proteins.BMC Evol. Biol. 2009; 9: 229Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cells from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) have been extensively used for protein expression, and a commercially available in vitro translation lysate from Sf21 cells provides robust translation activity (8Ezure T. Suzuki T. Higashide S. Shintani E. Endo K. Kobayashi S. Shikata M. Ito M. Tanimizu K. Nishimura O. Cell-free protein synthesis system prepared from insect cells by freeze-thawing.Biotechnol. Prog. 2006; 22: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because the addition of purified SBP2, eEFSec, and rabbit aminoacyl tRNA to Sf21 lysates did not result in Sec incorporation activity, 3N. Gupta and P. R. Copeland, unpublished observation. we combined mammalian cell lysate (supplying Sec incorporation factors) and Sf21 lysate (supplying ample general translation factors) to identify conditions where eEFSec or SBP2 may be limiting. To analyze Sec incorporation in this system, we used a luciferase reporter consisting of the luciferase coding region with a single in-frame UGA codon at position 258, followed by the rat GPX4 SECIS element and a 100-nucleotide poly(A) tail (Fig. 1A). This method has been demonstrated to faithfully indicate Sec incorporation because the production of full-length and active luciferase is strictly SECIS- and SBP2-dependent (13Mehta A. Rebsch C.M. Kinzy S.A. Fletcher J.E. Copeland P.R. Efficiency of mammalian selenocysteine incorporation.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37852-37859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that PC-3 prostate cancer cells had reduced levels of the selenoprotein GPX1 compared with LNCaP prostate cancer cells and RWPE-1 nontumorigenic prostate cells (even when selenium levels were sufficient) suggesting that eEFSec and SBP2 may be limiting (17Rebsch C.M. Penna 3rd, F.J. Copeland P.R. Selenoprotein expression is regulated at multiple levels in prostate cells.Cell Res. 2006; 16: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We therefore first tested PC-3 lysates for Sec incorporation activity in the Sf21 system. As shown in Fig. 1B (lane 1), we observed easily detectable Sec incorporation that was approximately 9-fold higher than the background obtained from the mRNA with a mutant SECIS element. Upon the addition of FLAG-eEFSec, a 2-fold enhancement was observed whereas the addition of the fully active Xpress/His-tagged C-terminal fragment of SBP2 (XH-CTSBP2) alone or XH-CTSBP2 plus FLAG-eEFSec resulted in activity that was 3.5-and 7-fold greater than unsupplemented extract, respectively. The addition of FLAG-eEFSec and XH-CTSBP2 proteins did not enhance nonspecific UGA readthrough from mRNAs that harbored a mutant SECIS element (black bars) or total translation activity (data not shown). Importantly, these data clearly show an ∼2-fold enhancement in Sec incorporation upon the addition of recombinant FLAG-eEFSec, thus allowing the functional analysis of eEFSec mutants as described below. The overall structure and sequence of the first three domains of eEFSec are analogous to their counterparts in elongation factor eEF1A, whereas a C-terminal extension known as Domain IV is only found in eEFSec. This implies that eEFSec contains most of the canonical translation functions (e.g. nucleotide binding, tRNA recognition) within the first three domains, and Sec-specific activities (e.g. SBP2-SECIS binding) may be located in Domain IV. However, it is still unknown if Domain IV of eEFSec is required for Sec incorporation. The reported crystal structure of archaeal EFSec and sequence analysis placed Domain IV of mouse eEFSec at residues 441 through 583 (Fig. 2A). Multiple sequence alignments from species ranging from archaebacteria to human were used to determine conserved residues in Domain IV of eEFSec (Fig. 2A). The conserved residues that were analyzed in this study are boxed and identified by the mouse sequence. Each group of five residues was changed to alanine and analyzed for function, and each mutated protein is referred to by the residues that were changed (e.g. VERVM466–470). We successfully employed a similar method to identify critical residues in SBP2 (10Donovan J. Caban K. Ranaweera R. Gonzalez-Flores J.N. Copeland P.R.

Chem. 2008; 283: 35129-35139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Caban K. Kinzy S.A. Copeland P.R. The L7Ae RNA-binding motif is a multi-functional domain required for the ribosome-dependent Sec incorporation activity of Sec insertion sequence-binding protein 2.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6350-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A structural model of archaeal eEFSec is shown in Fig. 2B (4Leibundgut M. Frick C. Thanbichler M. Böck A. Ban N. Selenocysteine tRNA-specific elongation factor SelB is a structural chimaera of elongation and initiation factors.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), illustrating the overall domain structure and the positions of the conserved residues within Domain IV. Each of the mutant proteins, plus a version lacking all of Domain IV (ΔIV) were expressed in bacteria, purified on anti-FLAG beads, and analyzed for Sec incorporation activity in our novel eEFSec-dependent assay. The experiment shown in Fig. 2C (right panel) demonstrates that most of the penta-alanine mutants tested were defective for Sec incorporation, with the exception of VERVM466–470, which had near wild-type activity levels at ∼1.8-fold above background. This result indicates that most of Domain IV in eEFSec is essential for Sec incorporation. One explanation for the lack of Sec incorporation activity from Domain IV mutants could be the disruption of functional contacts between eEFSec and the SBP2/SECIS complex. We have described previously an EMSA that revealed a direct tRNA-independent but SECIS-dependent interaction between SBP2 and eEFSec (10Donovan J. Caban K. Ranaweera R. Gonzalez-Flores J.N. Copeland P.R. A novel protein domain induces high affinity selenocysteine insertion sequence binding and elongation factor recruitment.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35129-35139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Using this assay, we sought to determine whether the Domain IV mutant proteins are able to form a stable complex with SBP2/SECIS. As shown in Fig. 3, the addition of recombinant XH-CTSBP2 results in a mobility shift of the GPX4 probe and the further addition of FLAG-eEFSec to the SBP2/SECIS-binding reaction results in a “supershift” of the probe (Fig. 3, lanes 1–3). The complete deletion of eEFSec Domain IV eliminates binding to SBP2/SECIS (Fig. 3, compare lane 3 with 4). In addition, the mutation at KKRSR536–540 also eliminates supershifting activity, but the other mutations in Domain IV do not affect stable SBP2/SECIS binding. These data establish that Domain IV, specifically the region at KKRSR536–540, is required for the interaction between eEFSec and the SBP2/SECIS complex. This implies that disruption of SBP2-SECIS binding in eEFSec could inhibit Sec incorporation. However, the rest of the Domain IV mutants that are defective for Sec incorporation retained SBP2/SECIS binding, suggesting other functional roles in Domain IV of eEFSec. As mentioned above, we have thus far been unable to isolate a complex between eEFSec and SBP2 that lacks the SECIS element, suggesting that the SBP2/SECIS complex presents a unique conformation of either the SECIS element or SBP2 (or both) to eEFSec. The RBD of SBP2 was shown previously to be the site of eEFSec binding, thus making EMSA analysis of SBP2 mutants that lack SECIS binding limited to the two mutations within the SBP2 RBD that were previously shown to be inactive for Sec incorporation but retain SECIS binding (RFQDR647–651 and DGAQD746–750) (11Caban K. Kinzy S.A. Copeland P.R. The L7Ae RNA-binding motif is a multi-functional domain required for the ribosome-dependent Sec incorporation activity of Sec insertion sequence-binding protein 2.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6350-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). An analysis of those mutations in the context of the RDB protein fragment did not show defects in eEFSec binding (data not shown). We therefore chose to focus on determining whether we could identify a region of the SECIS element that is required for the SBP2/SECIS/eEFSec complex. Eukaryotic SECIS elements are stem-loop structures that are members of the kink-turn family of RNAs (see Fig. 4) (18Caban K. Copeland P.R.

They consist of an internal loop of 4–18 nucleotides flanked by two helices (20Chapple C.E. Guigó R. Krol A.

https://openalex.org/W2038514097,"XRCC1 plays a key role in the repair of DNA base damage and single-strand breaks. Although it has no known enzymatic activity, XRCC1 interacts with multiple DNA repair proteins and is a subunit of distinct DNA repair protein complexes. Here we used the yeast two-hybrid genetic assay to identify mutant versions of XRCC1 that are selectively defective in interacting with a single protein partner. One XRCC1 mutant, A482T, that was defective in binding to polynucleotide kinase phosphatase (PNKP) not only retained the ability to interact with partner proteins that bind to different regions of XRCC1 but also with aprataxin and aprataxin-like factor whose binding sites overlap with that of PNKP. Disruption of the interaction between PNKP and XRCC1 did not impact their initial recruitment to localized DNA damage sites but dramatically reduced their retention there. Furthermore, the interaction between PNKP and the DNA ligase IIIα-XRCC1 complex significantly increased the efficiency of reconstituted repair reactions and was required for complementation of the DNA damage sensitivity to DNA alkylation agents of xrcc1 mutant cells. Together our results reveal novel roles for the interaction between PNKP and XRCC1 in the retention of XRCC1 at DNA damage sites and in DNA alkylation damage repair."
https://openalex.org/W1968033769,"The maintenance and repair of skeletal muscle are attributable to an elaborate interaction between extrinsic and intrinsic regulatory signals that regulate the myogenic process. In the present work, we showed that obestatin, a 23-amino acid peptide encoded by the ghrelin gene, and the GPR39 receptor are expressed in rat skeletal muscle and are up-regulated upon experimental injury. To define their roles in muscle regeneration, L6E9 cells were used to perform in vitro assays. For the in vivo assays, skeletal muscle tissue was obtained from male rats and maintained under continuous subcutaneous infusion of obestatin. In differentiating L6E9 cells, preproghrelin expression and correspondingly obestatin increased during myogenesis being sustained throughout terminal differentiation. Autocrine action was demonstrated by neutralization of the endogenous obestatin secreted by differentiating L6E9 cells using a specific anti-obestatin antibody. Knockdown experiments by preproghrelin siRNA confirmed the contribution of obestatin to the myogenic program. Furthermore, GPR39 siRNA reduced obestatin action and myogenic differentiation. Exogenous obestatin stimulation was also shown to regulate myoblast migration and proliferation. Furthermore, the addition of obestatin to the differentiation medium increased myogenic differentiation of L6E9 cells. The relevance of the actions of obestatin was confirmed in vivo by the up-regulation of Pax-7, MyoD, Myf5, Myf6, myogenin, and myosin heavy chain (MHC) in obestatin-infused rats when compared with saline-infused rats. These data elucidate a novel mechanism whereby the obestatin/GPR39 system is coordinately regulated as part of the myogenic program and operates as an autocrine signal regulating skeletal myogenesis."

An emerging feature of several Kir channels is that they are regulated by cholesterol. However, the mechanism by which cholesterol affects channel function is unclear. Here we show that mutations of two distant Kir2.1 cytosolic residues, Leu-222 and Asn-251, form a two-way molecular switch that controls channel modulation by cholesterol and affects critical hydrogen bonding. Notably, these two residues are linked by a residue chain that continues from Asn-251 to connect adjacent subunits. Furthermore, our data indicate that the same switch also regulates the sensitivity of the channels to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, a phosphoinositide that is required for activation of Kir channels. Thus, although cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate do not interact with the same region of Kir2.1, these different modulators induce a common gating pathway of the channel.

https://openalex.org/W1983978431,"Inositol phosphates are key signaling molecules affecting a large variety of cellular processes. Inositol-polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) is a central component of the inositol phosphate biosynthetic routes, playing essential roles during development. IPMK phosphorylates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to inositol tetrakisphosphate and subsequently to inositol pentakisphosphate and has also been described to function as a lipid kinase. Recently, a catalytically inactive mammalian IPMK was reported to be involved in nutrient signaling by way of mammalian target of rapamycin and AMP-activated protein kinase. In yeast, the IPMK homologue, Arg82, is the sole inositol-trisphosphate kinase. Arg82 has been extensively studied as part of the transcriptional complex regulating nitrogen sensing, in particular arginine metabolism. Whether this role requires Arg82 catalytic activity has long been a matter of contention. In this study, we developed a novel method for the real time study of promoter strength in vivo and used it to demonstrate that catalytically inactive Arg82 fully restored the arginine-dependent transcriptional response. We also showed that expression in yeast of catalytically active, but structurally very different, mammalian or plant IPMK homologue failed to restore arginine regulation. Our work indicates that inositol phosphates do not regulate arginine-dependent gene expression."

The Src-tyrosine kinase has been implicated in modulating neurotransmission in CNS. Thus, our main goal was to correlate AMPA-mediated excitatory neurotransmission with the modulation of Src activity in retinal neurons. Cultured retinal cells were used to access the effects of AMPA stimulation on nitric oxide (NO) production and Src phosphorylation. 4-Amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein diacetate fluorescence mainly determined NO production, and immunocytochemistry and Western blotting evaluated Src activation. AMPA receptors activation rapidly up-regulated Src phosphorylation at tyrosine 416 (stimulatory site) and down-regulated phosphotyrosine 527 (inhibitory site) in retinal cells, an effect mainly mediated by calcium-permeable AMPA receptors. Interestingly, experiments confirmed that neuronal NOS was activated in response to calcium-permeable AMPA receptor stimulation. Moreover, data suggest NO pathway as a key regulatory signaling in AMPA-induced Src activation in neurons but not in glial cells. The NO donor SNAP (S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine) and a soluble guanylyl cyclase agonist (YC-1) mimicked AMPA effect in Src Tyr-416 phosphorylation, reinforcing that Src activation is indeed modulated by the NO pathway. Gain and loss-of-function data demonstrated that ERK is a downstream target of AMPA-induced Src activation and NO signaling. Furthermore, AMPA stimulated NO production in organotypic retinal cultures and increased Src activity in the in vivo retina.

The retina is a structure highly specialized in processing environmental signals. It is derived from the anterior neural tube during embryogenesis, and all major classes of neurotransmitter systems are as expressed in the mature tissue. Within mature retinal tissue there are different populations of neuronal and glial cells, including the microglia. In the CNS, fast glutamatergic neurotransmission is mediated by ionotropic receptors, mainly NMDA- and AMPA-type glutamate receptors. NMDA receptors are calcium channels that function in an activity-dependent manner, whereas the permeability of AMPA receptors to calcium ions is mainly dictated by the presence or not of GluR2 subunit in receptors composition (1Kwak S. Weiss J.H. Calcium-permeable AMPA channels in neurodegenerative disease and ischemia.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).

Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous signaling molecule that displays ubiquitous roles within neuronal cells, modulating several aspects of their physiology (3Garthwaite J. Concepts of neural nitric oxide-mediated transmission.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2008; 27: 2783-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 4Peña-Altamira E. Petazzi P. Contestabile A. Nitric oxide control of proliferation in nerve cells and in tumor cells of nervous origin.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2010; 16: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). NO is produced by nitric-oxide synthase enzymes (NOS) using l-arginine as substrate (5Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E. Nitric oxide. Physiology, pathophysiology, and pharmacology.Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). Besides, several effects of NO are mediated by activating its intracellular receptor, soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), which couples to the production of the second messenger cGMP (5Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E. Nitric oxide. Physiology, pathophysiology, and pharmacology.Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). In the retina, a high affinity transport system for l-arginine has already been described (6Cossenza M. Paes de Carvalho R. l-Arginine uptake and release by cultured avian retinal cells. Differential cellular localization in relation to nitric-oxide synthase.J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1885-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and neuronal NOS (nNOS) is abundantly expressed as well (7Fischer A.J. Stell W.K. Nitric-oxide synthase-containing cells in the retina, pigmented epithelium, choroid, and sclera of the chick eye.J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 405: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In line with this, endogenous NO levels in cultured retinal cells have been demonstrated to regulate the activity of NFκB and the dynamics of ascorbate transport (8Portugal C.C. da Encarnação T.G. Socodato R. Moreira S.R. Brudzewsky D. Ambrósio A.F. Paes-de-Carvalho R.

Chem. 2012; 287: 3860-3872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NO has been shown to have both an antiproliferative role (9Magalhães C.R. Socodato R.E.

Paes-de-Carvalho R. Glutamate and nitric oxide modulate ERK and CREB phosphorylation in the avian retina. Evidence for direct signaling from neurons to Müller glial cells.J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, correlations between glutamatergic neurotransmission and NO signaling have been described for several neuronal cells paradigms (3Garthwaite J. Concepts of neural nitric oxide-mediated transmission.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2008; 27: 2783-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The Src family kinases (SFKs) are a class of cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases that are highly conserved among metazoan. Classically, nine members represent this family: Src itself, Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Hck, Blk, Yrk, and Fgr (11Boggon T.J. Eck M.J. Structure and regulation of Src family kinases.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7918-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). All members display a highly conserved structure with four basic domains: Src homology (SH) 4; SH3; SH2, and SH1 domains (11Boggon T.J. Eck M.J. Structure and regulation of Src family kinases.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7918-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). SH3 domain interacts with proline-rich motifs (PXXP) in related proteins (11Boggon T.J. Eck M.J. Structure and regulation of Src family kinases.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7918-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). SH2 domain interacts with phosphotyrosine residues in specific set of proteins creating modular scaffold conformations (12Pawson T. Gish G.D. Nash P. SH2 domains, interaction modules, and cellular wiring.Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 504-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). SH1 is the domain that lies within the activation loop of SFKs; therefore, it directly participates in SFKs activation/inactivation cycle. Activation of SFKs is dictated by the phosphorylation status of both Tyr-416 (in the activation loop at SH1 domain) and Tyr-527 (at the C terminus) (13Roskoski Jr., R. Src kinase regulation by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). When Tyr-527 is phosphorylated, SFKs are in their inactive state. However, when Tyr-527 dephosphorylation is induced, the enzyme autophosphorylates Tyr-416, which promotes its full catalytic activity (13Roskoski Jr., R. Src kinase regulation by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). SFKs exhibit several important functions in the nervous system. For instance, they modulate long term potentiation (LTP) induction in the hippocampus (14Lu Y.M. Roder J.C. Davidow J. Salter M.W. Src activation in the induction of long term potentiation in CA1 hippocampal neurons.Science. 1998; 279: 1363-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), directly control NMDA-induced LTP in the olfactory bulb (15Kitazawa H. Yagi T. Miyakawa T. Niki H. Kawai N. Abnormal synaptic transmission in the olfactory bulb of Fyn kinase-deficient mice.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), regulate the process of myelin formation (16Umemori H. Sato S. Yagi T. Aizawa S. Yamamoto T. Initial events of myelination involve Fyn tyrosine kinase signalling.Nature. 1994; 367: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), and control BDNF-induced AMPA receptors expression in neocortical neurons (17Narisawa-Saito M. Carnahan J. Araki K. Yamaguchi T. Nawa H. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor regulates the expression of AMPA receptor proteins in neocortical neurons.Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although many efforts have already been made elucidating the mechanisms of both NO signaling pathway and SFKs in controlling neuronal functioning in the CNS, an accurate interplay between these systems in neuronal cells remains elusive. To the best of our knowledge, only one report has correlated NO-SFKs in neuronal cells, but this correlation took into account cortical neurons in a hypoxic microenvironment (18Mishra O.P. Ashraf Q.M. Delivoria-Papadopoulos M. NO-mediated activation of Src kinase during hypoxia in the cerebral cortex of newborn piglets.Neurosci. Lett. 2009; 460: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, given that NO and SFKs systems are extremely important for the normal functioning of CNS cells and that Src is highly expressed in developing retinal neurons (19Sorge L.K. Levy B.T. Maness P.F. pp60c-src is developmentally regulated in the neural retina.Cell. 1984; 36: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), we investigated the correlation between AMPAR activation, NO, and Src in neuronal cells. We demonstrate that CP-AMPARs and NO strictly control Src-tyrosine kinase activation in cultured retinal neurons through a cGMP- and PKG-dependent manner. Still, NO production is tightly regulated by AMPA-type glutamate receptors through a calcium-dependent manner, thus consecutively regulating Src activation. In addition, concatenated AMPA-NO-sGC-PKG-Src signaling directly control ERK MAP kinase functioning in this paradigm. Furthermore, AMPA-regulated Src phosphorylation is related to excitatory retinal cell death and can also be reproducible at the mature retina in vivo by intravitreous injections of AMPA. Fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs were obtained from a local hatchery and incubated at 38 °C in a humidified atmosphere.

E8 chick embryo retinas were dissected from other ocular tissues (including from the retinal pigmented epithelium) and digested with 0.1% trypsin (w/v) in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free calcium and magnesium-free HBSS for 17 min at 37 °C. Then cells were suspended in minimum essential medium (supplemented with 3% FBS (v/v), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), dissociated using a Pasteur pipette, and seeded in 24- or 12-well culture plastic dishes in a density of 2 × 107 cells/mm2. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2, 95% air. At C1 (1 day in culture) the medium was replaced with fresh medium, and at C2 or C3, cultures were serum-starved, and experiments were performed at C3 or C4, respectively. E8 purified cultures were carried out precisely as previously described (20Socodato R. Brito R. Calaza K.C. Paes-de-Carvalho R. Developmental regulation of neuronal survival by adenosine in the in vitro in vivo avian retina depends on a shift of signaling pathways leading to CREB phosphorylation or dephosphorylation.J.

Then the retinas were digested with 0.07% trypsin (w/v) for 12 min, centrifuged at 1280 × g at room temperature for 1 min, and resuspended and mechanically dissociated using a glass pipette. Cells were counted and seeded with DMEM/F-12 + GlutaMAXTM-I (with 10% FBS (v/v), 50 μg/ml gentamicin) at 6-well culture plates at a density of 2 × 106 cells/cm2. The cells were kept in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2, 95% air for 7 days, but at C1 the medium was changed for fresh medium. Male Wistar rats (9 weeks old) were sacrificed, and their eyes were enucleated. Retinas were carefully dissected completely free from other ocular tissues. Next, 4 radial cuts were performed in each retina using WPI scissors (World Precision Instruments, Inc.). Retinas were carefully transferred to 6-well culture plates with 0.4 μm polycarbonate filter inserts and cultured with Neurobasal A medium (with 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 1× B27 and 10 mm l-glutamine) for 4 days at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2, 95% air ratio. The explants were checked every day, so they did neither dry nor did the retinas float. Low passage HEK293T cells were seeded in 90-mm culture dishes. When cultures reached ∼80% confluence cells were co-transfected overnight with virus-producing plasmids with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection ratios were as follows: 6 μg of shRNA plasmids to 3 μg of psPAX2 to 3 μg of VSVG (2:1:1) or 8 μg of Src constructs to 4 μg of pUMVC to 2 μg of VSVG (4:2:1). Normal growth media replaced the next day transfection media, and cells were cultivated for additional 48 h. Next, media with viral particles were collected and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected to new tubes. Cultured retinal cells were infected with viral supernatants at C0 (2 h after plating) overnight. At C1, infection media was replaced for normal growth media, and cells were cultivated up to C4. At C3, cultures were serum-starved for 24 h, and at C4 experiments were carried out. Chicken retina mixed cultures extracts were prepared as previously described (10Socodato R.E. Magalhães C.R.

Neurochem. 2009; 108: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For rat retina mixed cultures extracts, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with RIPA-DTT buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris base, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.5% DOC (w/v), 0.1% SDS (w/v), 1 mm DTT, and a Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.5). Next, cells were scrapped off from the plates, transferred to tubes, sonicated, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected to new tubes, and the pellet was discarded. The amount of protein in each sample was determined using a BCA reagent kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting in cultures obtained from chicken retina were carried out exactly as described elsewhere (10Socodato R.E. Magalhães C.R. Paes-de-Carvalho R.

Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris buffer saline (TBS)-Tween at room temperature, and primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Next, membranes were washed 3 × 10 min with TBS-Tween, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Then membranes were washed 6 × 5 min with TBS-Tween and developed using an enhanced chemifluorescence detection kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence labeling was captured using Typhoon FLA 9000 system. Western blots were carried out primarily using AKT as a loading control. Previous works from our group were conducted also using AKT as Western blots loading with reproducible results (10Socodato R.E. Magalhães C.R. Paes-de-Carvalho R.

Furthermore, to rule out any discrepancies in the results generated for pSrc, we compared the variations induced by AMPA and SNAP treatment in total Src levels in relation to AKT and actin. We concluded that neither Src nor AKT protein varied in cultured retinal cells stimulated with AMPA and SNAP (supplemental Fig. 1). Coverslips with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde-fixed E8C3 chicken retina cultures were washed 2 × 5 min in PBS and incubated for 1 h with blocking solution (5% BSA (w/v), 5% FBS (v/v), and 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) in PBS. Next, primary antibodies were added, and the coverslips were maintained in a humidified chamber for 12 h. On the following day, coverslips were washed 3 × 10 min with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit Alexa 568 or anti-mouse Alexa 488) for 2 h. After that, coverslips were washed 2 × 10 min with PBS, 1 × 10 min with TBS, incubated for 1 min with a solution of 1 μg/ml DAPI, and rinsed twice in TBS buffer. Then coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold anti-fade reagent and visualized under a Nikon 80i fluorescence microscope. Quantification of the fluorescence intensity in experimental groups was determined using the ImageJ (Wayne Rasband, NIH) program. Briefly, 8-bit images were acquired at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels using identical gain and offset parameters for all experimental groups; gamma values were never modified in any case for any group. Next, photomicrographs were converted to gray scale and thresholded in ImageJ software. Lower threshold measurements were modified accordingly within all experimental groups, and the upper threshold values were maintained at 255. Values corresponding to pixels intensity (mean pixel intensity and integrated intensity) in each group were developed in the ImageJ software and statistically analyzed using the GraphPad Prism Version 5.00 for Mac (GraphPad Software, CA). Cultured E8C3 chicken retinal cells were incubated with DAF-FM-DA (5 μm) in the presence of NMDA receptor antagonist APV (100 μm) for 45 min. Incubation with specified drugs was performed after this preincubation period. Next, cultures were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (w/v) for 10 min, and coverslips were mounted in microscope slides using ProLong Gold and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Acquired images were processed and quantified using the ImageJ software as described above. Immunocytochemistry for pSrc Tyr-416 was performed as mentioned above in purified retinal neuronal cultures. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope. Afterward, images were developed in xyz 8-bit mode at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels in confocal mode. Next, images were thresholded and exported as raw tiff photomicrographs using the ZEN 2009 software (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Neurites and secondary branches in each neuron were converted to gray scale and individually studied using the ROI manager in the ImageJ software. Pixel intensities were quantified as described above. Culture medium was collected to tubes and centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to Eppendorf tubes and kept on ice. Samples were added to an ELISA plate and mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent (0.5% sulfanilamide (w/v), 2.5% H3PO4 (w/v), 0.05% N-1-naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (w/v)). Plates were maintained on dark for 30 min at room temperature, and then the absorbance was measured at 550 nm. Male Long Evans rats (8 weeks old) were anesthetized using a mix of ketamine (75 μg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally administrated. AMPA (3 μl of a 2 mm stock solution; estimated final concentration to be 100 μm in the vitreous) was gently injected into the rat left eyes vitreous body. The control (right eye) was injected with PBS (3 μl). After 1 h of AMPA administration, the animals were sacrificed, and their eyes were enucleated. The retinas were carefully dissected in ice-cold HBSS and transferred to tubes containing 150 μl of RIPA-DTT buffer. Afterward, the samples were sonicated (6 pulses of 1 s) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was collected to new tubes and frozen at −80 °C. Total amount of protein in each sample was determined by the BCA method. The samples were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, and Western blot was carried out as described above. The data were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni post-test or unpaired two-tailed Student t test using the GraphPad Prism Version 5.00 for Mac (GraphPad). We began trying to correlate excitatory activation mediated by glutamate with Src function. For this purpose we applied glutamate (250 μm) to cultured retinal cells and assessed the phosphorylation of Src at Tyr-416, which indicates that the enzyme is activated. The concentration of glutamate used was based on previous studies demonstrating that it is non-toxic to cultured retinal cells (10Socodato R.E. Magalhães C.R. Paes-de-Carvalho R.

https://openalex.org/W2000758165,"Long-lived proteins exist in a number of tissues in the human body; however, little is known about the reactions involved in their degradation over time. Lens proteins, which do not turn over, provide a useful system to examine such processes. Using a combination of Western blotting and proteomic methodology, age-related changes to a major protein, γS-crystallin, were studied. By teenage years, insoluble intact γS-crystallin was detected, indicative of protein denaturation. This was not the only change, however, because blots revealed evidence of significant cross-linking as well as cleavage of γS-crystallin in all adult lenses. Cleavage at a serine residue near the C terminus was a major reaction that caused the release of a 12-residue peptide, SPAVQSFRRIVE, which bound tightly to lens cell membranes. Several other crystallin-derived peptides with double basic residues also lodged in the cell membrane fraction. Model studies showed that once cleaved from γS-crystallin, SPAVQSFRRIVE adopts a markedly different shape from that in the intact protein. Further, the acquired helical conformation may explain why the peptide seems to affect water permeability. This observation may help explain the changes to cell membranes known to be associated with aging in human lenses. Age-related cleavage of long-lived proteins may therefore yield peptides with untoward biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W2072543436,"Two of the four WNK (with no lysine (K)) protein kinases are associated with a heritable form of ion imbalance culminating in hypertension. WNK1 affects ion transport in part through activation of the closely related Ste20 family protein kinases oxidative stress-responsive 1 (OSR1) and STE20/SPS1-related proline-, alanine-rich kinase (SPAK). Once activated by WNK1, OSR1 and SPAK phosphorylate and stimulate the sodium, potassium, two chloride co-transporters, NKCC1 and NKCC2, and also affect other related ion co-transporters. We find that WNK1 and OSR1 co-localize on cytoplasmic puncta in HeLa and other cell types. We show that the C-terminal region of WNK1 including a coiled coil is sufficient to localize the fragment in a manner similar to the full-length protein, but some other fragments lacking this region are mislocalized. Photobleaching experiments indicate that both hypertonic and hypotonic conditions reduce the mobility of GFP-WNK1 in cells. The four WNK family members can phosphorylate the activation loop of OSR1 to increase its activity with similar kinetic constants. C-terminal fragments of WNK1 that contain three RFXV interaction motifs can bind OSR1, block activation of OSR1 by sorbitol, and prevent the OSR1-induced enhancement of ion co-transporter activity in cells, further supporting the conclusion that association with WNK1 is required for OSR1 activation and function at least in some contexts. C-terminal WNK1 fragments can be phosphorylated by OSR1, suggesting that OSR1 catalyzes feedback phosphorylation of WNK1."

Although SR141716A, also known as rimonabant, has been withdrawn from the market due to severe side effects, there remains interest in some of its many potential medical applications. Consequently, it is imperative to understand the mechanism by which SR141716A exerts its inverse agonist activity. As a result of using an approach combining mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations, we determined the binding mode of SR141716A. We found from the simulation of the CB1-SR141716A complex that SR141716A projects toward TM5 to interact tightly with the major binding pocket, replacing the coordinated water molecules, and secures the Trp-3566.48 rotameric switch in the inactive state to promote the formation of an extensive water-mediated H-bonding network to the highly conserved SLAXAD and NPXXY motifs in TM2/TM7. We identify for the first time the involvement of the minor binding pocket formed by TM2/TM3/TM7 for SR141716A binding, which complements the major binding pocket formed by TM3/TM5/TM6. Simulation of the F1742.61A mutant CB1-SR141716A complex demonstrates the perturbation of TM2 that attenuates SR141716A binding indirectly. These results suggest SR141716A exerts inverse agonist activity through the stabilization of both TM2 and TM5, securing the Trp-3566.48 rotameric switch and restraining it from activation.

High quality nitrogen sources such as NH4+ inhibit uptake of poor nitrogen sources, such as amino acids. Both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms operate in nutrient uptake regulation; however, many components of this system remain uncharacterized in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Here, we demonstrate that the Spt-Ada-Gcn acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex modulates leucine uptake. Initially, we noticed that a branched-chain amino acid auxotroph exhibits a peculiar adaptive growth phenotype on solid minimal media containing certain nitrogen sources. In fact, the growth of many auxotrophic strains is inhibited by excess NH4Cl, possibly through nitrogen-mediated uptake inhibition of the corresponding nutrients. Surprisingly, DNA microarray analysis revealed that the transcriptional reprogramming during the adaptation of the branched-chain amino acid auxotroph was highly correlated with reprogramming observed in deletions of the SAGA histone acetyltransferase module genes. Deletion of gcn5+ increased leucine uptake in the prototrophic background and rendered the leucine auxotroph resistant to NH4Cl. Deletion of tra1+ caused the opposite phenotypes. The increase in leucine uptake in the gcn5Δ mutant was dependent on an amino acid permease gene, SPCC965.11c+. The closest budding yeast homolog of this permease is a relatively nonspecific amino acid permease AGP3, which functions in poor nutrient conditions.

https://openalex.org/W1989383421,"The three-component toluene dioxygenase system consists of an FAD-containing reductase, a Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, and a Rieske-type dioxygenase. The task of the FAD-containing reductase is to shuttle electrons from NADH to the ferredoxin, a reaction the enzyme has to catalyze in the presence of dioxygen. We investigated the kinetics of the reductase in the reductive and oxidative half-reaction and detected a stable charge transfer complex between the reduced reductase and NAD(+) at the end of the reductive half-reaction, which is substantially less reactive toward dioxygen than the reduced reductase in the absence of NAD(+). A plausible reason for the low reactivity toward dioxygen is revealed by the crystal structure of the complex between NAD(+) and reduced reductase, which shows that the nicotinamide ring and the protein matrix shield the reactive C4a position of the isoalloxazine ring and force the tricycle into an atypical planar conformation, both factors disfavoring the reaction of the reduced flavin with dioxygen. A rapid electron transfer from the charge transfer complex to electron acceptors further reduces the risk of unwanted side reactions, and the crystal structure of a complex between the reductase and its cognate ferredoxin shows a short distance between the electron-donating and -accepting cofactors. Attraction between the two proteins is likely mediated by opposite charges at one large patch of the complex interface. The stability, specificity, and reactivity of the observed charge transfer and electron transfer complexes are thought to prevent the reaction of reductase(TOL) with dioxygen and thus present a solution toward conflicting requirements."
https://openalex.org/W1994229664,"The actin-based molecular motor myosin VI functions in the endocytic uptake pathway, both during the early stages of clathrin-mediated uptake and in later transport to/from early endosomes. This study uses fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to examine the turnover rate of myosin VI during endocytosis. The results demonstrate that myosin VI turns over dynamically on endocytic structures with a characteristic half-life common to both the large insert isoform of myosin VI on clathrin-coated structures and the no-insert isoform on early endosomes. This half-life is shared by the myosin VI-binding partner Dab2 and is identical for full-length myosin VI and the cargo-binding tail region. The 4-fold slower half-life of an artificially dimerized construct of myosin VI on clathrin-coated structures suggests that wild type myosin VI does not function as a stable dimer, but either as a monomer or in a monomer/dimer equilibrium. Taken together, these FRAP results offer insight into both the basic turnover dynamics and the monomer/dimer nature of myosin VI."
https://openalex.org/W2072134624,"Post-translational modifications play essential roles in regulating protein structure and function. Protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) catalyzes the biologically relevant lipidation of up to several hundred cellular proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis of FTase coupled with peptide selectivity measurements demonstrates that molecular recognition is determined by a combination of multiple interactions. Targeted randomization of these interactions yields FTase variants with altered and, in some cases, bio-orthogonal selectivity. We demonstrate that FTase specificity can be ""tuned"" using a small number of active site contacts that play essential roles in discriminating against non-substrates in the wild-type enzyme. This tunable selectivity extends in vivo, with FTase variants enabling the creation of bioengineered parallel prenylation pathways with altered substrate selectivity within a cell. Engineered FTase variants provide a novel avenue for probing both the selectivity of prenylation pathway enzymes and the effects of prenylation pathway modifications on the cellular function of a protein."
https://openalex.org/W2081940155,"Insulin stimulates the mobilization of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) storage vesicles to the plasma membrane, resulting in an influx of glucose into target tissues such as muscle and fat. We present evidence that CLIP-associating protein 2 (CLASP2), a protein previously unassociated with insulin action, is responsive to insulin stimulation. Using mass spectrometry-based protein identification combined with phosphoantibody immunoprecipitation in L6 myotubes, we detected a 4.8-fold increase of CLASP2 in the anti-phosphoserine immunoprecipitates upon insulin stimulation. Western blotting of CLASP2 immunoprecipitates with the phosphoantibody confirmed the finding that CLASP2 undergoes insulin-stimulated phosphorylation, and a number of novel phosphorylation sites were identified. Confocal imaging of L6 myotubes revealed that CLASP2 colocalizes with GLUT4 at the plasma membrane within areas of insulin-mediated cortical actin remodeling. CLASP2 is responsible for directing the distal end of microtubules to the cell cortex, and it has been shown that GLUT4 travels along microtubule tracks. In support of the concept that CLASP2 plays a role in the trafficking of GLUT4 at the cell periphery, CLASP2 knockdown by siRNA in L6 myotubes interfered with insulin-stimulated GLUT4 localization to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, siRNA mediated knockdown of CLASP2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport. We therefore propose a new model for CLASP2 in insulin action, where CLASP2 directs the delivery of GLUT4 to cell cortex landing zones important for insulin action."

When they are recruited to associate with membranes, most of the 14-3-3 proteins are localized in the Golgi (12Preisinger C. Short B. De Corte V. Bruyneel E. Haas A. Kopajtich R. Gettemans J.

The capacity of agonists to modulate downstream signaling molecules depends on availability of the receptors on cell surface. The number of cell surface 7TMRs reflects a delicate balance between the biosynthesis export pathway and the endocytosis pathway. The post-activation endocytic events such as internalization, recycling, and degradation have been well documented, and most 7TMRs share similar mechanisms (1Liu-Chen L.Y. Agonist-induced regulation and trafficking of κ-opioid receptors.Life Sci. 2004; 75: 511-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 13Moore C.A. Milano S.K. Benovic J.L. Regulation of receptor trafficking by GRKs and arrestins.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar); however, regulation along the export pathway is much less understood. Evidence is emerging showing that the transport process of 7TMRs along the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi-plasma membranes is regulated and involves specific sorting motifs and proteins (7Chen C.

COPI is an ADP-ribosylation factor-dependent adaptor protein that coats vesicles transporting proteins from cis-Golgi back to the ER, i.e. retrograde transport. Some membrane-bound proteins contain sorting motifs in their C-tails that interact with COPI and direct the protein to exit the Golgi and return to the ER. In the C-tail of the hKOPR, there is such a motif, 359RVR361. Deficiency in ER-Golgi-plasma membrane trafficking of several 7TMR mutants has been shown to be associated with human diseases. Mutations of vasopressin V2 receptor, gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, and rhodopsin are linked to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and retinitis pigmentosa, respectively (19Morello J.P.

In contrast, deletion in the HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5 (CCR5-Δ32) decreases cell surface expression, which in turn reduces viral infection (22Benkirane M. Jin D.Y. Chun R.F. Koup R.A. Jeang K.T.

In addition, pharmaco-chaperones also enhance cell surface expression of wild type 7TMRs (for review, see Ref. 24Chen Y. Liu-Chen L.Y.

Therefore, delineation of molecular mechanisms that regulate trafficking along the export pathway of 7TMRs will provide a better understanding of 7TMR biology and have implications for therapeutic intervention. In this study we investigated the interaction of 14-3-3ζ with the hKOPR and its functional significance with the focus on its role in membrane protein transport and possible mechanisms of effects of 14-3-3ζ.

Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and pGEX-4T-1 bacterial expression plasmid were from GE Healthcare. pET-30a(+) bacterial expression vector and Bug-Buster protein extraction reagent were obtained from Novagen Co. (Madison, WI). Mouse neuro2A (N2A) cells were purchased from ATCC. Timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River, Inc. (Horsham, PA). Animals were allowed to acclimate to the animal facility for 2 days. The rats were housed one animal per cage on a 12:12-h light/dark cycle with lights on at 7 a.m. and with ad libitum access to food and water. Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Temple University School of Medicine. Animal care and experimental procedures were conducted according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, 1996). Mouse Neuro2A (N2A) neuroblastoma cells transfected with FLAG-hKOPR (N2A-FLAG-hKOPR cells) (clone 95) were used with untransfected N2A cells as the control. Cells (108 cells) were solubilized with TTSEC buffer (2% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (1 tablet/10 ml), pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, incubated overnight with M2 anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to agarose, washed with 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer/150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS)/1% Triton X-100 4 times, and eluted twice with 100 FLAG peptide in 0.1% Nonidet P-40/0.2 m NaCl/20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then resolved with 8% SDS-PAGE. Twenty-nine protein bands that were immunoprecipitated from N2A-FLAG-hKOPR cells, but not from N2A cells, were excised for proteomic analyses, which were performed by Proteomics Core Facility, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Microflow reverse-phase HPLC/MS/MS was used for the analyses. Among the proteins identified was 14-3-3ζ. cDNA clone encoding the hKOPR tagged with the FLAG epitope N-terminal to the first Met (FLAG-hKOR) in the vector pcDNA3 was generated previously (25Xu W.

Site-directed mutagenesis and the overlap polymerase chain reaction method were used to mutate 354RQSTS358 to 354AQSTA358 (FLAG-hKOPR-AQSTA), 359RVR to 359AVR (FLAG-hKOPR-AVR) or 359RVR to 359KVR (FLAG-hKOPR-KVR) in the C-tail of the hKOPR with FLAG-hKOPR in pcDNA3 as the template. The mutated cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3, and DNA sequence determination was performed to ensure correct generation of all mutations and no unwanted mutations. Neuro2A cells were transfected with the FLAG-human δ-opioid receptor (N2A-FLAG-hDOPR), FLAG-rat μ-opioid receptor (N2A-FLAG-rMOPR), FLAG-hKOPR (N2A-FLAG-hKOPR), FLAG-hKOPR-AQSTA (N2A-FLAG-hKOPR-AQSTA), FLAG-hKOPR-KVR, FLAG-hKOPR-AVR, or 3HA-hKOPR, each in pcDNA3, and clonal cells stably expressing each receptor were established using Geneticin as the selection pressure. A clonal cell line for each receptor with a similar receptor expression level, ∼1.5 pmol/mg proteins, was used for this study. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F-12 HAM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mg/ml Geneticin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Primary neurons were obtained from the cerebral cortex of fetal rats (19 days of gestation). Timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Co.) were anesthetized. Cerebral cortices of fetal rats were rapidly removed and collected in cold Hanks' balanced salt solution and then dissociated with a scalpel and treated with 2 mg/ml papain in Hanks' balanced salt solution at 37 °C for 10 min. Dissociated cells were filtered through a cell strainer with a pore size of 40 μm and centrifuged at 500 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was removed, and cells were resuspended in complete medium (neurobasal medium supplemented with 10% B27 (or 10% fetal calf serum), 0.5 mm glutamine). Dissociated cells were diluted and plated on 60-mm dishes coated with poly-d-lysine. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 3 days of plating, non-neuronal cells were removed by the addition of 1 μm arabinosylcytosine. After 5–9 days, cells were used for experiments. N2A-FLAG-hKOPR cells grown to ∼80% confluence in a 10-cm cell culture dish were transfected with 10 μg of the indicated cDNA constructs or the vector (control) and 6 ml of Opti-MEM medium using 30 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. N2A-FLAG-hKOPR cells (∼80% confluence) in 6-well plates were transfected with 100 pmol/well 14-3-3ζ siRNA or luciferase siRNA (control) with 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. At 16 h after transfection, medium was replaced by 10 ml of Opti-MEM with 10% serum. About 40 h after transfection, cells were harvested for experiments. N2A-FLAG-hKOPR cells in 12-well plates were grown to ∼70% confluence and transfected with 40 pmol of 14-3-3ζ siRNA or luciferase siRNA (control) using 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM medium according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twelve hours later, cells were transfected with 2.0 μg of HA-14-3-3ζ cDNA or the vector (control) using 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM medium. 4–6 h after the second transfection, medium was replaced with MEM medium + 10% serum. About 48 h after the second transfection, cells were harvested for immunoblotting. N2A-HA-hKOPR cells were cultured on coverslips placed in a 12-well plate (2 × 105 cells/well). Cells were fixed with methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. Immunofluorescence was performed by incubating cells with both mouse M1 anti-HA (1:1000) and rabbit anti-14-3-3ζ (1:62.5) primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and followed by incubating with the secondary antibodies goat-anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa-488 and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000), respectively, at room temperature for 30 min. Images were acquired using a Nikon TE300 fluorescence microscope with a 40× objective lens and a Magnifire digital camera. NIH Image and Adobe Photoshop were used for image processing. Immunoblotting was performed to examine the expression of FLAG-hKOPR proteins as we described previously (7Chen C. Li J.G. Chen Y. Huang P. Wang Y. Liu-Chen L.Y.

Cells were solubilized with 2× Laemmli sample buffer (4% SDS, 0.1 m DTT, 20% glycerol, 62.5 mm Tris, and bromphenol blue, pH6.8), subjected to 8% Tricine-SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto PDVF Immobilon membranes. Membranes were treated with blocking solution, incubated with polyclonal FLAG antibody (1:5000) followed by goat anti-rabbit polyclonal IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000), and reacted with ECL Western-blotting detection reagents. GAPDH was used as the loading control, which was probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-GAPDH antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:1000). Images were captured by use of a FUJIFILM LAS1000 plus system and quantitated using the ImageGauge software (Version 4.1, Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.). Co-immunoprecipitation was performed according to our published procedure (5Li J.G. Chen C. Liu-Chen L.Y.

Briefly, N2A-FLAG-hKOPR cells in a 100-mm plate were washed with cold PBS and solubilized with TTSEC buffer for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-FLAG M2-agarose to immunoprecipitate FLAG-hKOPR. Immunoprecipitated materials were then separated with SDS-PAGE, transferred, and immunoblotted with anti-14-3-3ζ (1:3000) or anti-β-COP (1:1000) antibodies as described above for the Western blot. Rat brains were lysed and solubilized in TTSEC buffer containing 0.1 mm PMSF. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min, the supernatant was filtered sequentially with 0.45 and 0.22 μm membranes.

Rescue of function experiments with the lacking protein portion expressed as a separate independent domain demonstrated restoration of glycine receptor functionality in vitro. This construct harbored most of the TM3-4 loop, TM4, and the C terminus and was required for concomitant transport of the truncated α1 and the complementation domain from the endoplasmic reticulum toward the cell surface, thereby enabling complex formation of functional glycine receptors. Here, the complementation domain was stepwise truncated from its N terminus in the TM3-4 loop. Truncation of more than 49 amino acids led again to loss of functionality in the receptor complex expressed from two independent domain constructs. We identified residues 357–418 in the intracellular TM3-4 loop as being required for reconstitution of functional glycine-gated channels. All complementation constructs showed cell surface protein expression and correct orientation according to glycine receptor topology. Moreover, we demonstrated that the truncations did not result in a decreased protein-protein interaction between both glycine receptor domains. Rather, deletions of more than 49 amino acids abolished conformational changes necessary for ion channel opening. When the TM3-4 loop subdomain harboring residues 357–418 was expressed as a third independent construct together with the truncated N-terminal and C-terminal glycine receptor domains, functionality of the glycine receptor was again restored. Thus, residues 357–418 represent an important determinant in the process of conformational rearrangements following ligand binding resulting in channel opening.

This intracellular domain (iD) shows the highest variability among all Cys-loop receptors and seems to have developed late in evolution because the prokaryotic isoforms ELIC and GLIC lack this domain. Previous reports have shown that this domain is involved in receptor trafficking and anchoring. Anchoring is facilitated via interaction of the GlyRβ TM3-4 loop with E-domain monomers of gephyrin, which forms a hexagonal lattice structure at the postsynaptic density (8Kim E.Y. Schrader N.

Two basic motifs near TM3 and TM4 in GlyRα1 were found to interact with Gβγ subunits, which enhances the apparent glycine affinity of the receptor and results in an increase in ion channel open probability (10Yevenes G.E.

Recently, pharmacological modulation of the GlyRα1 via the TM3-4 loop has been reported for ethanol as well as propofol (11Moraga-Cid G. Yevenes G.E. Schmalzing G. Peoples R.W. Aguayo L.G.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 20523-20528Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, the TM3-4 loop seems not to be important for signal transduction in general because a replacement of this large domain in GABAC and the 5HT3 receptor by the short linker present in GLIC still resulted in functional ion channels (13Jansen M. Bali M. Akabas M.H. Modular design of Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels. Functional 5-HT3 and GABA rho1 receptors lacking the large cytoplasmic M3M4 loop.J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 131: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A lack of the TM3-4 loop, TM4, and the C terminus as present in the mouse model oscillator, however, results in non-functionality of the GlyR complex. A coexpression of those truncated N-terminal receptor domains (α1-trc) together with the lacking domain as a separate construct resulted in rescue of ion channel functionality, thus demonstrating that GlyRs are composed of independently folding domains (14Villmann C. Oertel J. Ma-Högemeier Z.L. Hollmann M. Sprengel R. Becker K. Breitinger H.G. Becker C.M. Functional complementation of Glra1(spd-ot), a glycine receptor subunit mutant, by independently expressed C-terminal domains.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2440-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Rescue efficiency was largely dependent on the presence of the basic motif RRKRRH in the α1-trc at its C-terminal end. This motif has previously been shown to be important for surface integration and subunit-specific sorting (15Melzer N. Villmann C. Becker K. Harvey K. Harvey R.J. Vogel N. Kluck C.J. Kneussel M.

In the present study, we have investigated protein-protein interactions within GlyRα1 protein when coexpressed from two independently folding domains. Truncated GlyRs result in non-functionality. Coexpression with the lacking protein domain regained functional channels. We truncated the complementation construct harboring parts of the TM3-4 loop, TM4, and the C terminus from its N-terminal end. With a deletion of more than 49 residues, functionality was again almost abolished. Truncation of 62 amino acids never resulted in a functional ion channel configuration. Therefore, residues Ser406–Glu411 localized at the interface between the last variable (V2) and constant (C3) region before TM4 (Fig. 1) are critical for ion channel reconstitution from two independent domains. Cell surface expression and correct membrane orientation corresponding to GlyR topology were demonstrated for all GlyR domain constructs. Finally, protein-protein interactions of the N-terminally truncated α1-trc together with the complementation constructs were not disturbed. Moreover, the constituted two-domain receptor seemed to fail at the transduction of ligand binding into channel opening. This disability was conquered by coexpression with the 62 amino acids of TM3-4 loop(357–418) as a third independent construct. Thus, functional GlyRs can be rebuilt from three small independent domains, substantiating the mosaic structure of Cys-loop receptors. HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were grown in Earle's minimal essential medium (PAA Laboratories), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine (200 mm), and 50 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. 24 h after splitting (2 × 106 cells for a 10-cm dish; 0,15 × 106 cells for a 3-cm dish), the cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (17Chen C. Okayama H. High efficiency transformation of mammalian cells by plasmid DNA.Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). Cell culture medium was replaced 24 h after transfection. Whole cell lysates were prepared 48 h post-transfection by adding 500 μl of preheated 2× SDS sample buffer onto a 10-cm dish of transfected HEK293 cells. The samples were heated for 10 min at 95 °C before application to SDS-PAGE. The preparation was performed 48 h post-transfection with HEK293 cells grown in 10-cm dishes as described above. After detaching the cells with cold 1× PBS (PAA Laboratories) and centrifugation (10 min, 1000 × g), the cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of buffer H (10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 250 mm EDTA, 250 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets; Roche Applied Science). The probes were homogenized in a tapered glass tissue grinder and with an Ultra-Turrax disperser, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g. Afterward, the pellets were resolved in buffer H, and the homogenization and centrifugation step was repeated once. The pellets were resolved in buffer B (25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, 250 mm EDTA, 250 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets; Roche Applied Science). The biotinylation assay was performed 48 h post-transfection with HEK293 cells grown in 10-cm dishes as described above. After removing the cell culture medium and three washing steps with cold 1× PBS (PAA Laboratories), the surface proteins were labeled with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotin-amido)hexanoate (Pierce) for 30 min, followed by washing with quenching buffer (192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris in PBS, pH 8.0) for 10 min. The cells were detached with ice-cold 1× PBS and centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g, followed by cell lysis with TBS (Tris-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture tablet; Roche Applied Science) and a 1-min centrifugation step at 13,000 × g. The supernatant (whole protein fraction) was incubated with 50 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C while rotating. After removing the supernatant and washing the beads three times in TBS, the biotinylated proteins were eluted by boiling with 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Transfected HEK293 cells were grown on 10-cm dishes as described above and used 48 h after transfection. After washing the cells on ice with cold 1× PBS three times, 600 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 160 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture tablets, pH 7.4) was added at each plate to scrape off the cells. After centrifugation (10 min, 4 °C, and 15,000 rpm) the supernatant (lysate) was used as input for co-immunoprecipitation experiments. To 600 μl of the respective solution, 2 μl of MAb2b antibody (1:200; Synaptic Systems) and 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (1:1 slurry; Sigma) were added and agitated overnight at 4 °C. Then the supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed three times (50 mm Tris-HCl, 160 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0). Proteins were eluted from the beads by incubating in 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer at 95 °C for 7 min. For SDS-PAGE, 11% or 15% polyacrylamide gels were used, followed by a Western blot on nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h with TBB (TBS + 5% BSA) and incubated for 1 h or overnight (4 °C) with primary antibodies. The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-coupled (incubation for 1 h) for detection with the ECLplus system (GE Healthcare). Transfected HEK293 cells were grown on polylysine-coated coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in PBS (10 min), washed three times with PBS, and blocked as well as permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% donkey serum in PBS (30 min) at room temperature. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with PBS. This procedure was repeated with secondary antibodies. Finally, cells were embedded in Mowiol and subjected to confocal microscopy on a DMIRE2 confocal microscope (Leica). For live stain, transfected cells were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C before fixation without permeabilization. All experiments were performed 24 h post-transfection. For different stainings, monoclonal mouse anti-GlyRα (1:200; MAb4a, Synaptic Systems; recognized epitope harbors amino acids 96–105 of mature glycine receptor α1 subunit), polyclonal rabbit anti-Myc (1:200, C-19 or A-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), monoclonal mouse anti-Myc (1:200; 9E10, Santa Cruz) or monoclonal mouse anti-GFP (1:500; Roche Applied Science), rabbit anti-Na+,K+ ATPase polyclonal antibody (Chemicon), and polyclonal goat anti-GlyRα1 TM3-4 loop (1:50; H18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used as primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse Alexa488 (1:400; Invitrogen), goat anti-rabbit Cy3 and donkey anti-goat Cy5 (both 1:250; Dianova). For live stain, monoclonal mouse anti-GlyRα1 (1:100; MAb2b, Synaptic Systems; antibody raised against amino acids 1–10 of the mature glycine receptor α1 subunit) and polyclonal rabbit anti-Myc (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used as primary antibodies. For detection with enhanced chemiluminescence, a goat anti-mouse HRP (1:10,000; Dianova) antibody was utilized as secondary antibody. For multiple-sequence alignments, the sequences and boundaries of the TM3-4 loops were taken from the Uniprot database annotation (18UniProt ConsortiumThe Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) 2009.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D169-D174Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). GlyR subunit variants of the TM3-4 loops from either human (Homo sapiens, hs), or mouse (Mus musculus, mm) were subjected to a multiple-sequence alignment using the T-Coffee algorithm (19Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. T-Coffee. A novel method for fast and accurate multiple sequence alignment.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5446) Google Scholar). Maximal current amplitudes (Imax) were measured by the patch clamp technique in a whole-cell configuration mode. Current signals were amplified with an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA). 24 h after transfection, whole-cell recordings from HEK293 cells were performed by application of ligand (glycine, 1 mm) using a U-tube system. The extracellular buffer consisted of 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH. The internal buffer was 120 mm CsCl, 20 mm N(Et)4Cl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 11 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. Recording pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate capillaries with an open resistance of about 4 megaohms. Current responses were measured at a holding potential of −60 mV. All experiments were carried out at room temperatures. Bar diagrams show the average value ̄χ of n measurements, and the error bars are the S.E. Truncated variants of the GlyR α1 subunit, which have been identified in a family with hyperekplexia (20Tsai C.H. Chang F.C. Su Y.C. Tsai F.J. Lu M.K. Lee C.C. Kuo C.C. Yang Y.W. Lu C.S.

Koch M. Saul B. Becker C.M.

Coexpressions with a corresponding complementation construct iD-TM4, led to reconstitution of functional ion channels (14Villmann C. Oertel J. Ma-Högemeier Z.L. Hollmann M. Sprengel R. Becker K. Breitinger H.G. Becker C.M. Functional complementation of Glra1(spd-ot), a glycine receptor subunit mutant, by independently expressed C-terminal domains.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2440-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The TM3-4 loop determines the largest part of the complementation construct but also exhibits the highest variability among glycine receptor subunits (Fig. 1) (15Melzer N. Villmann C. Becker K. Harvey K. Harvey R.J. Vogel N. Kluck C.J. Kneussel M. Becker C.M. Multifunctional basic motif in the glycine receptor intracellular domain induces subunit-specific sorting.J. Biol.

In this study, we aimed at mapping the interaction site between GlyRα1-trc and the C-terminal complementation construct, Myc-iD-TM4 (Fig. 2A). The iD of the GlyR can be subdivided into constant (C1–3) regions, which are highly conserved among species, and variable (V1-2) regions (Fig. 1). We generated successive N-terminal truncations of the complementation construct (Fig. 2B), leading to constructs Myc-iDΔ22-TM4 (lack of V1, subdivision of C2), Myc-iDΔ27-TM4 (subdivision of C2), Myc-iDΔ43-TM4 (subdivision of V2), Myc-iDΔ49-TM4 (division between V2 and C3), Myc-iDΔ55-TM4 (split C3), Myc-iDΔ62-TM4 (lack of V1 to half of C3), and Myc-iDΔ67-TM4 (lack of V1 to almost all of C3), with Δx representing the number of deleted amino acids. For GlyR reconstitution from three independent domains, α1-trc, iDΔ62-TM4, and the TM3-4 loop were coexpressed (Fig. 2A, right). The construct 3–4 loop harbors amino acid residues 357–418 (TM3-4 loop(357–418) refers to TM3-4 loop further on) (Fig. 2B, bottom). An N-terminal Myc epitope (9E10) was added for easy immunodetection to either constructs iDΔx-TM4 or the TM3-4 loop (Myc-TM3-4 loop). The expression of the generated constructs (Myc-iDΔx-TM4) together with α1-trc was confirmed using crude membrane protein preparations of transfected HEK293 cells. The α1-trc was detected using MAb4a, a monoclonal antibody recognizing an N-terminal epitope of the GlyRα polypeptides. Expression of the complementation constructs was verified with an α-Myc antibody. No significant differences in membrane expression were observed between Myc-iDΔx-TM4 constructs and α1-trc (Fig. 3A). A slight decrease for Myc-iDΔ62-TM4 and Myc-iDΔ67-TM4 was determined concomitantly with less coexpressed α1-trc but similar Na+,K+ ATPase expression compared with other preparations (e.g. with Myc-iDΔ27-TM4). The expression of the Na+,K+ ATPase is much higher in untransfected cells; thus, the overexpression of other membrane proteins following transfection seems to reduce the endogenous expression of the Na+,K+-ATPase. The surface expression was tested with biotinylation assays of cotransfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 3B). In addition to a signal in the whole cell pool and the intracellular/unbound protein fraction, all complementation constructs (iDΔx-TM4, with x representing the number of amino acids deleted, Δ22–Δ67) showed a strong signal at the outer surface of transfected HEK293 cells when coexpressed with α1-trc. Note that complementation constructs harboring TM4 expressed in the absence of α1-trc get transported toward the cell surface only to some extent (14Villmann C. Oertel J. Ma-Högemeier Z.L. Hollmann M. Sprengel R. Becker K. Breitinger H.G. Becker C.M. Functional complementation of Glra1(spd-ot), a glycine receptor subunit mutant, by independently expressed C-terminal domains.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2440-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The assembly of functional GlyR complexes was analyzed using electrophysiological recordings in a whole-cell configuration of transfected HEK293 cells. The different complementation constructs with N-terminal truncations of up to 67 amino acids were not able to gate any Cl− currents when expressed alone (data not shown). Isolated expression of α1-trc did not lead to functional ion channels either. Coexpression of α1-trc together with Myc-iD-TM4, however, rescued functional Cl− channels (Fig. 4) (14Villmann C. Oertel J. Ma-Högemeier Z.L. Hollmann M. Sprengel R. Becker K. Breitinger H.G. Becker C.M. Functional complementation of Glra1(spd-ot), a glycine receptor subunit mutant, by independently expressed C-terminal domains.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2440-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The ion channel complementation with Myc-iDΔ22-TM4 rescued the Cl− influx with efficiency comparable with the full-length Myc-iD-TM4 variant. The rescues with the truncated variants Myc-iDΔ27-TM4, Myc-iDΔ43-TM4, and Myc-iDΔ49-TM4 showed decreased Imax values. Maximal currents of α1-trc with Myc-iDΔ27-TM4 reached 79% (1,9 ± 0,34 nA) and with Myc-iDΔ43-TM4 75% (1,8 ± 0,15 nA) of the rescue efficiency compared with the full-length Myc-iD-TM4 variant. The observed GlyR rescue efficiency for Myc-iDΔ49-TM4 was further decreased to 58% (1.4 ± 0.027 nA, Table 1). All glycine-gated currents in a two-domain approach were non-desensitizing, as observed for full-length GlyRα1. Therefore, truncations up to 49 amino acids did not change GlyR channel properties, such as desensitization behavior (Fig. 4A). Larger truncations of the complementation construct led to an almost complete loss of rescue efficiency. With the Myc-iDΔ55-TM4 variant, responses were only observed in two of 10 cells recorded. The two most extensive truncations (Myc-iDΔ62-TM4 and Myc-iDΔ67-TM4) led to a complete disappearance of glycine-evoked currents in at least three different batches of cells (Fig. 4B). Constructs iDΔ55-TM4, iDΔ62-TM4, and iDΔ67-TM4 generated positively charged N termini with RK at the beginning of iDΔ55-TM4, RAK for iDΔ62-TM4, and KISR for iDΔ67-TM4. This could hinder an interaction with the intracellular C terminus of α1-trc, which is also positively charged. Previously, it was shown that an addition of the positively charged motif RRKRRH to the N terminus of the full-length iD-TM4 abolished ion channel function when coexpressed with α1-trc harboring the same motif at its C-terminal end (14Villmann C. Oertel J. Ma-Högemeier Z.L. Hollmann M. Sprengel R. Becker K. Breitinger H.G. Becker C.M. Functional complementation of Glra1(spd-ot), a glycine receptor subunit mutant, by independently expressed C-terminal domains.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2440-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). When the truncated α1 variant present in the mouse mutant oscillator was used, harboring GDIT at its C terminus instead of RRHRRH, functional rescue was still observed. Thus, interactions by charged motifs seem to play a role within the TM3-4 loop of the GlyRα1 to permit conformational changes.TABLE 1Whole-cell maximal currents [Imax] of various coexpressed GlyR domainsExpressed domainsNo. of cellsImax, 1 mm GlyNormalized Imax (% of α1-trc + iD-TM4)nA%WT α196.8 ± 0.31α1-trc + Myc-iD-TM492.4 ± 0.20100α1-trc + Myc-iDΔ22-TM492.6 ± 0.34108α1-trc + Myc-iDΔ27-TM491.9 ± 0.3479α1-trc + Myc-iDΔ43-TM4101.8 ± 0.1575α1-trc + Myc-iDΔ49-TM4101.4 ± 0.2458α1-trc + Myc-iDΔ55-TM42/10aOnly 2 of 10 cells responded to glycine application; Imax value in this case includes also non-responding cells.0.04 ± 0.0272α1-trc + Myc-iDΔ62-TM4100 ± 00α1-trc + Myc-iDΔ67-TM4100 ± 00α1-trc + Myc-iDΔ62-TM4 + 3-4 loop90.48 ± 0.06320α1-trc + 3-4 loop100 ± 00a Only 2 of 10 cells responded to glycine application; Imax value in this case includes also non-responding cells. Open table in a new tab Loss of functionality can result from (i) loss of expression or, if expressed, from (ii) loss of an intracellular interaction between the N-terminal truncated α1 variant and the complementation constructs or from (iii) wrong orientation of the complementation construct within the plasma membrane. Because protein expression (i) as well as cell surface localization has been shown for all complementation constructs and α1-trc (Fig. 3, A and B), lack of expression can be excluded as a reason for non-functionality of the GlyR channels. To test whether an intracellular protein-protein interaction is required for formation of functional ion channels, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays. The α1-trc construct was cotransfected with one complementation variant (Myc-iD-TM4, Myc-iDΔ22-TM4, Myc-iDΔ27-TM4, Myc-iDΔ43-TM4, Myc-iDΔ49-TM4, Myc-iDΔ55-TM4, Myc-iDΔ62-TM4, or Myc-iDΔ67-TM4) in HEK293 cells. The input was verified for α1-trc stained with Mab4a and iDΔx-TM4 detected with α-Myc (Fig. 5A). Following lysis of transfected HEK293 cells, α1-trc was precipitated using the GlyRα1-specific monoclonal antibody MAb2b. More binding capacity of antibody (lower dilution of antibody, 1:150) resulted in more precipitated iDΔx-TM4 protein (Fig. 5B, bottom left panels). The co-precipitated Myc-iDΔx-TM4 variants were detected with the α-Myc antibody (9E10). A strong interaction was observed for α1-trc coexpressed with the full-length complementation construct Myc-iD-TM4. In contrast to th"
