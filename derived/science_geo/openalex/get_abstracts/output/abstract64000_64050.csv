https://openalex.org/W1483940173,"Abstract Methods are presented for preparation of extracts from cultured cells from the nervous system and for study of choline acetyltransferase, acetylcholinesterase, glutamate decarboxylase, and catechol O-methyltransferase activities. These enzyme activities are markers that can be used for studying gene expression in neurons. The methods are sufficiently sensitive so that all assays can be performed with protein harvested from one Petri dish. Activities of the marker enzymes were assessed in surface cultures of newborn mouse brain cells, and in glial and nonbrain cell lines. Low activities of choline acetyltransferase, acetylcholinesterase, and glutamate decarboxylase were detected in all the cells tested. All of these activities, and particularly glutamate decarboxylase, were higher in cultured brain cells from newborn animals than in non-neuronal cell lines. Glutamate decarboxylase activity in glial cells and in brain cells was inhibited more than 95% by 1 mm amino-oxyacetic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1490476764,"Abstract The metabolism of l-3-methylhistidine was studied in the rat using 3-[G-3H]methylhistidine and 3-[methyl-14C] methylhistidine. The charging of skeletal muscle tRNA was examined in vitro using a pH 5 enzyme fraction, tRNA, and a mixed aminoacyl ligase preparation or an unresolved homogenate. With these systems, radioactivity from labeled leucine and histidine was transferred to tRNA in a form labile to incubation in alkaline buffers. No significant amount of radioactivity was present in the tRNA fraction when labeled 3-methylhistidine was studied under these conditions. In vivo administration of labeled 3-methyl-histidine also failed to show charging of tRNA obtained either from the pH 5 enzyme fraction of muscle or tRNA resolved from the total RNA of skeletal muscle by chromatography on Sephadex G-200. Orally or parenterally administered 3-[Me-14C]methylhistidine was quantitatively recovered in urine and feces. The urine contained unchanged 3-methylhistidine together with a metabolite identified by means of infrared and mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance and by chromatography as N-acetyl-3-methylhistidine. The proportion of the total urinary radioactivity recovered as this metabolite rose progressively from 40% in rats weighing 50 g to 90% in animals weighing over 250 g. The relative distribution of radioactivity in these two urinary compounds did not change when increasing doses of exogenous 3-methylhistidine were given to mature rats. These findings are discussed in relation to protein turnover in skeletal muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1644280525,Abstract The behavior of mixed phases of dipalmitoyl lecithin and cholesterol containing less than 33 mole per cent cholesterol has been followed by wide angle x-ray diffraction. Two phases are present in this region: a pure lecithin phase and a mixed phase of lecithin and cholesterol. We propose a model in which each cholesterol is surrounded by lipid hydrocarbon chains to describe the structure of the mixed phase.
https://openalex.org/W74922760,Abstract The dependence of the enthalpies of the cooperative transitions of aqueous dispersions of synthetic dimyristoyl and dipalmitoyl l-α-lecithin on the cholesterol content has been determined in an adiabatic differential scanning calorimeter. In each case the transition enthalpy decreases linearly with increasing mole percentage of cholesterol and vanishes at 33 mole per cent of cholesterol. This indicates that each molecule of added cholesterol removes 2 molecules of lipid from the hexagonal phase which undergoes the cooperative transition to liquid crystal phase.

https://openalex.org/W1498145857,"Abstract Transport of nucleosides in human erythrocytes, previously shown to occur by facilitated diffusion, was further characterized using procedures that measured efflux from cells containing radioactive uridine or thymidine. Efflux of either uridine or thymidine was accelerated several fold in the presence of extracellular uridine or thymidine. Similar apparent kinetic constants for accelerative exchange diffusion of uridine and thymidine and mutual acceleration of efflux indicated that both nucleosides are transported with equal facility by the same mechanism. Specificity of nucleoside transport was investigated by assessing the ability of structurally related compounds to accelerate uridine efflux when added at different concentrations to the extracellular medium. Various pyrimidine ribo- and 2'-deoxyribonucleosides were accepted as permeants by the transport mechanism, which appeared to be less tolerant of modifications in the sugar than in the base portion of the permeant molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1548726235,"Abstract A bisubstrate kinetic analysis of UDP-glucuronyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.17) has been carried out in forward and reverse directions with p-nitrophenol as aglycone. Reciprocal plots of initial rates of activity indicated that the kinetics followed a sequential mechanism. Product inhibition studies, using UDP and p-nitrophenylglucuronide as inhibitors of the forward reaction, gave a pattern of two competitive and two noncompetitive inhibitions, compatible with a rapid equilibrium, random order kinetic mechanism, or an ordered mechanism of the Theorell-Chance type. Isotope exchange experiments, however, excluded an ordered mechanism. Comparison of the kinetic parameters for the forward and reverse directions showed that the rate at Vmax is 2-fold greater for the reverse than for the forward reaction. At finite substrate concentrations, however, the forward reaction is favored because of the 100-fold higher affinity of the enzyme for p-nitrophenol than for its glucuronide. It was also observed that high concentrations of p-nitrophenol and o-aminophenol have nonspecific activating effects on UDP-glucuronyltransferase. The importance of these findings for the design and interpretation of kinetic experiments is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1589866573,"Abstract Xylosyltransferase from embryonic chick epiphyseal cartilage catalyzes the transfer of xylose from UDP-xylose to particulate endogenous acceptors or to an exogenous protein acceptor obtained by Smith degradation of bovine chondroitin sulfate-protein complex. Use of the exogenous protein acceptor enabled determination of enzymic activity independently of endogenous acceptors. Homogenization of cartilage in buffers containing from 0.2 to 1 m KCl followed by centrifugation at 105,000 x g yielded soluble fractions which contained from 65 to 95% of the xylosyltransferase activity. The remainder of the activity was associated with the 105,000 x g sediment. Soluble enzyme was fractionated with ammonium sulfate and purified by centrifugation on density gradients or by gel filtration resulting in a 50-fold purification. The specific activities of xylosyltransferase in embryonic chick cartilage, brain, liver, and intestine were compared; enzyme activity was highest in cartilage. The specific activity of the transferase in brain was 8% of that from cartilage, whereas liver and intestine exhibited no measurable activity with the exogenous acceptor. Xylosyltransferase catalyzes the first of the sequential glycosyltransferase reactions required for synthesis of the chondroitin sulfate-protein linkage region and formation of polysaccharide chains. It is postulated that xylosyltransferase controls the initiation of chondroitin sulfate chains on core protein. The level of xylosyltransferase in tissue appears to be correlated with amounts of the mucopolysaccharide synthesized."
https://openalex.org/W1987945535,"Chromatin has been prepared from nuclei isolated from the dinoflagellate alga Gyrodinium cohnii. This chromatin contains RNA, acid-insoluble proteins, and acid-soluble proteins; the respective ratios to amount of DNA are about 0.09, 0.48, 0.08 (by weight). Not only is the amount of acid-soluble protein associated with the DNA much less than it is in the typical eukaryote, but polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in urea at pH 3.2 produces a banding pattern different from that of typical histones. There is one predominant band that migrates about as fast as does histone IV from corn. These findings are of interest, because the nuclear organization in the dinoflagellates appears to be intermediate between the prokaryotes and the eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W1676502954,"Abstract The dissociation of histones from DNA by salt has been reinvestigated. Previous methods were examined and found to be unsatisfactory for two reasons. (a) An endogenous proteolytic enzyme is highly active during the separation procedures and the resultant histones are severely degraded. (b) Dissociated histones aggregate at elevated salt concentrations and histone can subsequently cosediment with DNA, thus decreasing the apparent level of dissociation. We describe conditions in solutions of sodium phosphate-urea at pH 5.5 which not only alleviate the above problems, but also permit a highly selective extraction of either histone F1 or of histones F1, F2b, and F2a2 from the other histone fractions. Evidence is presented arguing that histones interact with DNA through two kinds of binding. On the one hand there is a substantial involvement of electrostatic ionic bonds and on the other there is a variable contribution from an interaction which has many of the features of the hydrophobic bond. This latter interaction is characterized by (a) a decrease in strength in solutions of urea, (b) a decrease in strength in hydrophobic solvents such as in the presence of 1-propanol or propylurea, and (c) an increase in binding at higher temperatures. The contribution of this additional interaction is most marked for the arginine-rich histones F3 and F2a1 and least so for the lysine-rich histone F1. We have also observed that F3 and F2a1 bind denatured DNA so strongly that they cannot be dissociated at all in high salt or at low pH unless high urea concentrations are also present."
https://openalex.org/W1602788481,"Abstract A procedure for the isolation of an M-line protein from chicken skeletal muscle is described. This includes the extraction of M-line protein with 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.7) and removal of contaminants by their precipitation at pH 5.0 followed by their absorption on DEAE-cellulose in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.6). Identification of the M-line protein is based on the ability of antibody prepared against crude M-line extract to specifically alter the thickness and stability of the M-line structure in myofilament preparations. The isolated protein caused the aggregation of myosin filaments. The protein is a globular particle of low axial asymmetry and molecular weight 88,000 ± 2,000. It dissociates into two subunits of molecular weight 43,000 ± 1,000 in 6 m guanidine HCl. Evidence is presented showing a high degree of homogeneity with respect to size of the native protein in dilute salt solution as well as the subunit species under denaturing conditions."

The enzyme has been partially purified from bone marrow of rabbits treated with this agent. Enzymatic reduction of cytosine ribonucleotides requires a dithiol, magnesium ions, and ATP and is stimulated by ferrous ions. CDP is a better substrate than CTP or CMP. The purified extracts can be separated into two protein fractions which must be combined for activity, indicating that the enzyme system consists of more than one component."
https://openalex.org/W1581467588,"β-Ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthetase catalyzes the chain elongation step of fatty acid biosynthesis, the condensation of fatty acyl-ACP with malonyl-ACP yielding β-ketoacyl-ACP, CO2, and ACP. This enzyme catalyzes two additional reactions, fatty acyl-CoA-ACP transacylation and the decarboxylation of malonyl-ACP to form acetyl-ACP and CO2. Both the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthetase and the fatty acyl-CoA-ACP transacylase reactions are inhibited by low levels of iodoacetamide, and this inhibition can be prevented by a prior incubation of the enzyme with fatty acyl-CoA compounds that are substrates in the transacylase reaction. These inhibition experiments suggest that the fatty acyl-ACP and fatty acyl-CoA may have a common site on the enzyme. The malonyl-ACP decarboxylase reaction is only partially inhibited by iodoacetamide. The findings presented help to explain the fatty acyl-CoA-dependent malonyl-CoA-14CO2 exchange reaction catalyzed by β-ketoacyl-ACP synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1493006373,Abstract The polyadenylate (poly(A)) sequences of about 150 nucleotides found among all size classes of the pulse-labeled RNA bound to HeLa polysomes which is thought to be messenger RNA (mRNA) provide a basis for the purification of such RNA by hybridization to polythymidylate (poly(T)) cellulose. Poly(A) sequences comprised 15% of the RNA from polysomes which was bound to poly(T) cellulose. This RNA when released from the cellulose sedimented in sucrose gradients as a heterogeneous population with sedimentation velocities ranging from 6 S to more than 30 S with a maximum of about 18 S. A similar population of RNA molecules was also purified on poly(T) cellulose from cytoplasmic components sedimenting more slowly than polyribosomes.

https://openalex.org/W1499803018,Abstract α- and β-d-Mannopyranosidases from crude pineapple bromelain were isolated and purified. The specificities of these enzymes were tested with synthetic and natural mannosides. The β-d-mannosidase completely released the terminal d-mannose from Man → GlcNAc → GlcNAc → Asn obtained from ovalbumin and Aspergillus oryzae α-amylase. The α-d-mannosidase was inactive toward the core glycopeptides. Physical data also support the presence of β-d-mannosyl linkage in the core glycopeptides.

https://openalex.org/W1508323399,"Hemoglobin Bethesda is a β chain variant of human hemoglobin in which histidine is substituted for tyrosine at position 145. From chemical and crystallographic studies, it has been postulated that the tyrosine normally found at this position is critical for the maintaince of a normal deoxy structure. Kinetic studies of the carbon monoxide and n-butyl isocyanide binding reactions show that deoxyhemoglobin Bethesda in low ionic strength buffers at pH 7.0 exhibits noncooperative, chain-like behavior. Under the same conditions, the Soret absorption spectrum of deoxyhemoglobin Bethesda is more like that of the isolated α and β chains than that of the normal deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. In addition, reversible dissociation of deoxyhemoglobin Bethesda can be demonstrated by ultracentrifugation experiments. All of these results suggest that at neutral pH deoxyhemoglobin Bethesda exists in a conformation analogous to that postulated for liganded hemoglobin A. However, in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate, more normal, cooperative kinetic behavior is observed, subunit dissociation is reduced, and the absorption spectrum in the Soret region is found to be virtually identical with that of deoxyhemoglobin A. Thus, the substitution of histidine for tyrosine 145 β drastically alters the ability of hemoglobin to form a normal deoxy structure. Studies of the dissociation of oxygen and n-butyl isocyanide from saturated hemoglobin Bethesda indicate, however, that this mutation does not alter the intrinsic reactivities of the α and β heme sites within the liganded conformation. Rather, this amino acid substitution appears to inhibit the quaternary change to the deoxy conformation in such a manner that only on the addition of organic phosphates is behavior observed which resembles that of normal deoxyhemoglobin A."
https://openalex.org/W1580075230,"Abstract A kinetic analysis of the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (acetylcholine acetyl-hydrolase, EC 3.1.1.7) by atropine is presented. It is shown that inhibition follows competitive kinetics at low concentrations of substrate (acetylthiocholine). At substrate concentrations above saturation atropine relieves the inhibition caused by excess substrate, but in this case, kinetic data are not of the competitive type. Rather, in the presence of atropine at high substrate concentration (acetylthiocholine iodide = 22.5 x 10-5 m), a plot of velocity versus substrate concentration changes into a sigmoid shape. The dependence of the reaction velocity on the atropine concentration is of an order less than 1 in the buffer studied and the substrate concentration below saturation (acetylthiocholine iodide = 7.5 x 10-5 m). At higher substrate concentrations (acetylthiocholine iodide = 7.5 x 10-4 m) the cooperativity of the inhibitor increases with n (the Hill coefficient) equal to 1.6."
https://openalex.org/W2149133071,"Abstract 5β, 7α-Dihydroxy-11-ketotetranor-prostanoic acid was the major metabolite excreted in the urine of guinea pigs injected with tritium-labeled prostaglandin E1, prostaglandin E2, 11α,15l-dihydroxy-9-ketoprost-5-enoic acid, 11α-hydroxy-9,15-diketoprostanoic acid, and 11α-hydroxy-9,15-diketoprost-5-enoic acid. A method was developed for quantitative determination of 5β,7α-dihydroxy-11-ketotetranor-prostanoic acid in 24-hour samples of guinea pig urine. The basal excretion of the metabolite in 10 male guinea pigs was 1.34 to 2.74 µg per kg of body weight x 24 hours. Administration of 50 mg of indomethacin per day inhibited the excretion of the urinary metabolite by about 98%."
https://openalex.org/W1520290988,"Abstract Pyruvate carboxylase purified from calf liver contains bound magnesium and bound manganese in a combined stoichiometry equivalent to the biotin content of this enzyme. Both metal ions are well correlated with enzymic activity when this enzyme is fractionated on columns of DEAE-Sephadex A-50 (SO42-) or Sephadex G-200. The bound metal status of this mammalian liver pyruvate carboxylase, therefore, differs from the pyruvate carboxylases purified from chicken (Scrutton, M. C., and Mildvan, A. S. (1968) Biochemistry 7, 1940) and turkey liver which are identified as manganese metallo-biotin enzymes. Magnesium replaces manganese as the bound metal of pyruvate carboxylase purified from the livers of chickens which have been raised on rations deficient in manganese. The relative content of magnesium and manganese in the purified enzyme reflects the manganese content of the ration on which the chickens were raised. When the ration containing the lowest level of manganese (0.3 mg per kg) is fed, the pyruvate carboxylase obtained is a magnesium metallobiotin enzyme. Substitution of magnesium for manganese occurs with retention of catalytic activity and causes only minor alterations in the catalytic properties of pyruvate carboxylase. Properties which are affected by the substitution include the apparent Km for pyruvate and the concentration of oxalate required for 50% inhibition of the over-all reaction. In the case of inhibition by oxalate the effect observed is in accord with predictions based on the properties of model complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1542613645,"Abstract The longitudinal proton magnetic relaxation rate (PRR) of water in manganous complexes has been measured as a function of frequency. The ternary complexes of manganous ion, nucleotide, and enzyme for three enzymes namely, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, formyl tetrahydrofolate synthetase, and creatine kinase, all exhibited a maximum in the value of the relaxation rate between 8 and 25 MHz. This observation shows that the correlation time which modulates the dipolar interaction between the electron and nuclear spins is frequency-dependent and must therefore be ascribed to the electron spin relaxation time. The enhancement of the PRR of water for the ternary complexes relative to that of the Mn(II) aquo-ion arises because the electron relaxation times for Mn(II) in the ternary complexes (10-8 to ∼10-9 sec) are much longer than the rotational correlation time (∼3 x 10-11 sec) for the simple aquo complex. The rotational modulation of the dipolar interaction for the ternary complexes is slower than modulation from electron spin relaxation and is no longer the dominant correlation time in the macromolecular complexes since their tumbling times are of the order of 10-8 to 10-7 sec. In the case of creatine kinase, the PRR of the abortive quaternary complex, E-Mn-ADP-creatine, has been deenhanced relative to the ternary complex, most markedly in the presence of nitrate ion, and the PRR increases monotonically with decreasing frequency. The number of water ligands in the first coordination sphere of Mn(II) in the quaternary complex is calculated from the relaxation rate and its frequency dependence to be less than one-half. The water proton relaxation rates obtained at various frequencies and temperatures point to the involvement of only outer sphere relaxation in the quaternary complex. It is concluded that a conformational change in the enzyme has occurred upon addition of the second substrate which makes the Mn(II) inaccessible to the solvent water. The binding of Mn(II) in the ternary MnUTP complex with UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is less than in the binary MnUTP complex in the absence of enzyme. The behavior of this nucleotidyl-transferring enzyme differs in this regard from phosphoryl-transferring enzymes from which it is inferred that the coordination scheme of Mn(II) may also differ."
https://openalex.org/W1571466217,"Abstract The vertebrate lens is composed of two distinct cell types, the epithelial cells and the fiber cells. The absolute rate of synthesis of total protein and of purified α-crystallin, a structural polymeric protein found in both cell types, has been calculated using the kinetics of [3H]leucine incorporation into organ-cultured lenses. The data show that in adult epithelial cells about 2% of α-crystallin is renewed per day, as opposed to 0.3% in cortex fiber cells. The rate of α-crystallin synthesis is about 7 times higher in epithelial cells than in cortex fiber cells; for non-α-crystallin proteins, the corresponding ratio is approximately 24. Both epithelial cells and cortex fiber cells are shown to be highly specialized for the synthesis of α-crystallin; 60% of newly synthesized protein in adult epithelial cells is α-crystallin, whereas in cortex fiber cells the proportion is 75%. The polymeric α-crystallin has been dissociated into its component subunits and the resulting mixture of polypeptide chains has been analyzed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Four discrete bands are resolved by this technique, corresponding to two acidic subunits (αA1 and αA2) and two basic subunits (αB1 and αB2). The kinetics of aggregation of these subunits to form the polymeric α-crystallin has been investigated in adult epithelial cells. Two major points emerge from this study. (a) About 60% of the leucine incorporated into α-crystallin is accounted for by subunit αA2 and about 30% by subunit αB2. Since the relative concentrations of αA2 and αB2 within the aggregate are 60% and 30%, respectively, the incorporation data indicate that in adult epithelial cells the composition of newly formed α-crystallin is identical to that of the previously aggregated molecule. (b) No significant uptake of radioactive leucine in the polymeric molecule via subunit αA1 is detectable. This is consistent with our previous report that this subunit is not a product of direct genetic translation."

https://openalex.org/W1491708946,"A detailed investigation of the Mg2+ activation of sheep kidney pyruvate carboxylase has been carried out. An analysis of the initial velocity kinetic data using two independent methods shows that the enzyme has an absolute requirement for Mg2+. Mg2+ and MgATP2- combine with the enzyme (E) in a random manner to form the final activated complex consisting of Mg2+-E-MgATP2-. Excess ATP4- is inhibitory because it shifts the equilibrium from the active complex Mg2+-E-MgATP2- to inactive complexes, e.g. Mg2+-E-ATP4-, which cannot form products. Furthermore, the analysis showed that the complex E-MgATP2- cannot break down to yield products. Investigation of the partial reactions by isotopic exchange confirmed that the presence of Mg2+ influences the binding of MgATP2- to the enzyme and has no influence on the second partial reaction, i.e. the carboxylation of pyruvate by the E-CO2 complex. The fact that Mg2+ altered the apparent Km value for MgATP2- suggested that the divalent cation induced a conformational change in the enzyme. Evidence supporting this hypothesis was obtained by determining the entropy change (ΔS° = 58.6 entropic units per mole) induced in the enzyme and by the change in emission intensity of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid when Mg2+ was bound to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1519449747,"Abstract Cortisol stimulated the synthesis of glycogen in fetal rat liver explants. The increase was proportional to the amount of glucose present in the incubation medium and occurred slowly over a 44-hour period. The ability of cortisol to stimulate glycogen synthesis was accelerated after prior incubation of explants for 42 hours with no steroid. Glucose alone led to the synthesis of very little glycogen. [U-14C]-glucose added to the incubation medium was incorporated into glycogen. The specific activities of [U-14C]glucose in the medium and in glycogen synthesized over a 44-hour period were approximately the same whether or not cortisol was present, indicating that glycogen was derived mainly from glucose. Fetal livers synthesized glucose and glycogen from l-[U-14C]alanine to a limited degree. The incorporation of label ranged from 0.2% to 1.6% of the dose; the extent was determined by the conditions of incubation. Cortisol did not affect the over-all gluconeogenic process, but it increased the proportion of label incorporated into glycogen and decreased the incorporation into glucose. Gluconeogenesis from l-[U-14C]alanine did not take place in the absence of glucose. Cortisol did not induce any changes which could be correlated with glycogen synthesis in the activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glycogen phosphorylase, glucose 6-phosphatase, fructose 1,6-diphosphatase, pyruvate kinase, alanine aminotransferase, or aspartate aminotransferase. Accumulation of glycogen under all conditions studied was directly proportional to changes in glycogen synthetase b. The a form of the enzyme was not affected by cortisol. It is concluded that (a) the major source of glycogen in fetal rat liver is glucose; (b) synthesis of glycogen from glucose is stimulated by cortisol; (c) gluconeogenesis takes place in fetal liver to a measureable extent; (d) cortisol does not influence gluconeogenesis; (e) cortisol directs a common six-carbon intermediate towards glycogen synthesis and away from glucose formation; (f) the effect of cortisol on glycogen synthesis depends on its ability to increase glycogen synthetase b activity."
https://openalex.org/W1568967054,"Abstract It was suggested recently that a soluble methyltransferase from Mycobacterium phlei, which was shown to transfer methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to position 6 of α(1 → 4)-linked d-glucooligosaccharides, may function in the biosynthesis of the 10 α(1 → 4)-linked 6-O-methyl-d-glucose residues of a mycobacterial lipopolysaccharide (Ferguson, J. A., and Ballou, C. E. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 4213). In a reinvestigation of this system, we have failed to observe methylation by the M. phlei extract unless the glucooligosaccharides were partially acetylated. We have studied this phenomenon further and have determined some of the characteristics of the reaction. Different oligosaccharide preparations with 0.2 to 1.6 acetyl groups per glucose unit were active as acceptors. At low levels of acetylation (0.2 acetyls per glucose), methylation occurred only at position 6. At high levels of acetylation (1.6 acetyls per glucose), methylation at position 6 was strongly depressed, and some methylation then occurred at position 3 as well. The 6-O-methyltransferase was studied in some detail by the use of oligosaccharides with low levels of acetylation. Partially acetylated oligosaccharides, with 5 to 15 glucose residues, were readily methylated. However, only a trace of methylation was obtained with the tetrasaccharide, and no activity was observed with the di- or trisaccharide, or with cyclooctaamylose. Digestion of the enzymically methylated octasaccharide with β-amylase gave products which suggested that methylation had occurred only at sites which were more than 4 glucose residues from the nonreducing end. This is consistent with the fact that the 6-O-methylglucose-containing section of the lipopolysaccharide itself begins 4 glucose units in from the nonreducing end. The structural similarity between the methylated octasaccharide and the mycobacterial lipopolysaccharide suggests that the 6-O-methyltransferase is specific for the methylation of a partially acylated or otherwise lipophilic precursor of the lipopolysaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1551905744,"Abstract 1. Inner membrane vesicles of rat liver mitochondria prepared by treating inner membrane + matrix particles with Lubrol WX to remove matrix (Chan, T. L., Greenawalt, J. W., and Pedersen, P. L. (1970) J. Cell Biol. 45, 291) are impermeable to sucrose and exhibit a rapid phase of swelling in ammonium phosphate but not in ammonium chloride. The mercurials mersalyl and p-mercuribenzoate, inhibitors of the phosphate transport system in intact mitochondria, markedly inhibit swelling of these vesicles. Ruthenium red, an inhibitor of the Ca++ transport system of intact mitochondria, has no effect on the swelling process. 2. When phosphate and a respiratory substrate are present, these vesicles accumulate up to 450 nmoles of Ca++ per mg of protein in 2 min. When arsenate, ATP, and ADP replace phosphate as anion a much lower level of Ca++ uptake is observed. The following anions when substituted for phosphate have essentially no supporting capacity: AMP, acetate, malate, citrate, α-ketoglutarate, glutamate, sulfate, nitrate, and thiocyanate. Unlike intact mitochondria, inner membrane vesicles neither support Ca++ uptake when ATP replaces respiratory substrates as an energy source, nor require addition of ADP or ATP to support maximal uptake in the presence of substrates. 3. Ca++ uptake is inhibited by uncoupling agents, respiratory inhibitors, ruthenium red, and the mercurials mersalyl and p-mercuribenzoate. Similar to its action on intact mitochondria ruthenium red inhibits Ca++ uptake catalyzed by inner membrane vesicles without significantly inhibiting respiration or phosphorylation. 4. Phosphate is accumulated together with Ca++ by a process also inhibited by uncoupling agents, mercurials, and ruthenium red. Phosphate accumulation is prevented by omission of Ca++ from the incubation medium. Calculation of Ca++:Pi accumulation ratios gives values near 1.50 corresponding to Ca3(PO4)2. 5. Two conclusions seem evident from these studies. First, the process of Ca++ uptake catalyzed by inner membrane vesicles, although similar, is not identical with the Ca++ uptake process catalyzed by intact mitochondria. Secondly, the active uptake of Ca++ and the active uptake of phosphate by these vesicles are interdependent processes which require both mercurial- and ruthenium red-sensitive components."

(1970) 245, 1856) that the inhibition of the aerobic desaturation of stearoyl coenzyme A by sterculate is a nonspecific detergent effect was reinvestigated. It was found that whereas 0.04 mm potassium sterculate inhibited about 50% of mouse liver microsomal desaturase activity, it required 0.3 mm concentration of potassium oleate to effect the same level of inhibition. Also, the degree of inhibition of the desaturase by sterculate was found not to be dependent on the protein concentration. Thus the specific effect of cyclopropene fatty acids in the inhibition of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase is confirmed."

The enzyme product has catalytic properties similar to those of aldolase modified by carboxypeptidase A in that it retains full activity with fructose 1-phosphate as substrate but has lost 95% of the original activity with fructose 1,6-diphosphate as substrate. The hexapeptides have the structures Ile-Ser-Asn-His-Ala-Tyr (α subunit) and Ile-Ser-Asp-His-Ala-Tyr (β subunit) and are produced in approximately equal amounts from aldolase preparations obtained from adult animals."
https://openalex.org/W70569184,"Abstract A study was made of the methyl sterols involved in sterol biosynthesis in developing rat brain. In addition to the determination of the endogenous sterols present in 15-day-old rat brain, experiments were conducted to establish which of these sterols could be labeled by a minced tissue preparation in the presence of [2-14C]mevalonic acid. The turnover of [14C]lanosterol, [4-3H]squalene oxide, and [14C]squalene by minced preparations was also shown. In the experiments involving incubation of labeled mevalonic acid with minced tissue preparations, the diunsaturated methyl sterols had a larger degree of labeling than the monounsaturated methyl sterols. Labeled squalene was also shown to be present in the mevalonate incubations. Under these in vitro conditions cholesterol was not found to be significantly labeled. Endogenous sterols of two types were examined, those occurring as steryl esters and those that were unesterified. A comparison of the distribution of sterols in these two fractions indicated a relatively small percentage of cholesterol (54.3%) in the steryl ester fraction. Based on gas chromatographic retention data and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, the following sterols were identified: lanosterol, 4,4-dimethyl-5α-cholesta-8,24-dien-3β-ol, 4,4-dimethyl-5α-cholest-8-en-3β-ol, 4α-methyl-5α-cholest-8-en-3β-ol, 4α-methyl-5α-cholesta-8,24-dien-3β-ol, 4α-methyl-5α-cholesta-7,24-dien-3β-ol, 4α-methyl-5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol, 5α-cholesta-7,24-dien-3β-ol, desmosterol, and cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1569254356,"Abstract The first reaction in the metabolism of cellobiose in Aerobacter aerogenes was shown to be adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent phosphorylation at C-6 of the nonreducing ring to yield 6-O-phosphoryl-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 4)-d-glucose (cellobiose monophosphate). The inducible β-glucoside kinase that catalyzes the reaction was partially purified and characterized. In addition to cellobiose, the following β-glucosides served as substrates: cellotriose, cellotetraose, cellobiitol, salicin, arbutin, gentibiose, sophorose, amygdalin, phenyl β-d-glucoside, and methyl β-d-glucoside."
https://openalex.org/W1531256915,"Abstract Complexes of histidine with neodymium(III) have been studied in aqueous solution by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The isotropic shifts of the histidine protons upon coordination to Nd+3 provide evidence as to the coordination sites. A 1:1 monodentate histidine-Nd+3 complex is observed below pH, 5.0 and a 1:1 bidentate histidine-Nd+3 complex is observed above pH, 6.0. The observed isotropic shifts of the bidentate complex are explained in terms of a pseudocontact mechanism. An equilibrium constant for 1:1 monodentate carboxyl coordination of histidine to Nd+3 is approximated. A study of the interactions of Nd+3 with histidine methyl ester gives evidence that Nd+3 will form similar complexes with a histidyl residue in a peptide linkage. Evidence is also presented for the formation of a 2:1 Nd+3-histidine complex at high metal ion concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W1552834651,"Abstract In order to elucidate the function of FAD, a cofactor of l-lysine monooxygenase, in the oxygenation of substrate, experiments were carried out with a substrate amount of enzyme. Under anaerobic conditions the enzyme-bound FAD was essentially fully reduced by an equimolar amount of substrate, l-lysine. The rate of FAD reduction was found to be dependent on the substrate concentration. When FAD was reduced with lysine and then the reaction mixture was deproteinized in the absence of oxygen, lysine was found to be converted to α-keto-e-aminocaproate (Δ1-piperidine 2-carboxylate), which was identified by paper electrophoresis, ion exchange column chromatography, and paper chromatography. In contrast to the aerobic reaction, essentially no carbon dioxide was produced. When the reduced FAD was reoxidized with air prior to deproteinization, the keto acid was also formed. The mechanism of formation of keto acid in these experiments was compared with the reaction mechanism of amino acid oxidase and discussed in relation to the oxygenation of lysine."

https://openalex.org/W986144521,"Abstract The binding site of α-chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.4.5) has been mapped to identify areas displaying steric hindrance to binding and areas of polar environment. Of the five isomeric methyl benzindancarboxylates tested as substrates, only methyl-4,5-benzindan-2-carboxylate (Compound X) underwent chymotryptic hydrolysis with moderate stereospecificity. This finding confirms Niemann's hypothesis that the aromatic binding site in chymotrypsin is planar, elongated, and curved. Comparison of the reactivities of X and methyl indan-2-carboxylate with their oxygen analogues, methyl 1,2-dihydronaphtho[2,1-b]furancarboxylate and methyl hydrocoumarilate, reveals that the polar atoms or groups adjacent to the α-carbon in locked substrates do not contribute significantly to the over-all reactivity or binding of these substrates when they are oriented productively but that they are detrimental when located incorrectly. This concept is supported by the extremely slow rate of hydrolysis of methyl 2-acetamidoindan-2-carboxylate (Compound VIII), a new rigid analogue of methyl N-acetylphenylalaninate (Compound VI). This observation indicates that the site that accommodates the acetamido group of l-VI is not left unoccupied when reactive enantiomers of cyclized substrates undergo chymotryptic hydrolysis, but the interaction there is imperfect."
https://openalex.org/W1560253455,"Abstract The mechanism of l-ribulose 5-phosphate 4-epimerase of Aerobacter aerogenes has been investigated by determining the kinetic isotope effect (Kt/Kh) for the epimerization of d-[4-T]xylulose 5-phosphate in the presence of d-[1-14C]xylulose 5-phosphate. The ratio of T:14C was determined for the isolated l-ribulose derived from aliquots of an epimerization reaction mixture during its progress toward equilibrium. From a plot of the ratio of the observed isotope ratio at any time to the initial or final ratio versus percentage of attainment of equilibrium, it was determined that there was essentially no isotope effect. This result contrasts with that obtained with uridine diphosphate glucose 4-epimerase where a normal isotope effect was observed and is consistent with recent observations that l-ribulose 5-phosphate 4-epimerase functions by a mechanism not involving oxidation-reduction at carbon 4."
https://openalex.org/W1573208361,"The effect of pregnancy and lactation on the urinary excretion patterns of neuramin lactose and neuramin N-acetyllactosamine, as well as on the neuraminic acid levels of tissues and serum, was studied in the rat. The urinary neuramin lactose content, 1.1 mg per 24 hours per kg of body weight in control rats, increased 3-fold during the course of pregnancy. With the onset of lactation there was a dramatic increase, which reached a peak on the 6th day after delivery (176 mg per 24 hours per kg). The urinary neuramin N-acetyllactosamine content, 0.47 mg per 24 hours per kg in control rats, increased 2-fold during pregnancy, but, in contrast to the excretion of neuramin lactose, no further increase occurred during lactation. Structural characterization of the excreted neuramin lactose material based on thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography, and mass spectrometry indicated that the increase in the urinary neuramin lactose content during lactation was due to only one of the three neuramin lactoses present in rat urine, namely N-acetylneuramin-(2 → 3)-lactose. Nonsuckling for 12 hours did not affect the excretion of neuramin lactose in the urine, whereas nonsuckling for longer periods caused a successive decrease. Removal of mammary tissue during lactation reduced the urinary excretion rates of neuramin lactose to one-ninth of the preoperative value in the 10- to 22-hour period after operation, while sham operation only reduced it to one-third. Of intraperitoneally injected neuramin lactose, 60 to 70% was excreted unchanged in the urine during the subsequent 12 hours. The results show that the increased amounts of neuramin lactose found in lactation urine are most probably derived from the mammary tissue and that the rate of production of neuramin lactose is probably at least twice as high as what could be expected on the basis of its concentration in milk."
https://openalex.org/W1532649563,"Abstract A previously undescribed class of enzymatic cycling systems, the nonlinear cycling systems, is presented and mathematical models are derived for three examples of the simplest type of nonlinear cycling system, the exponential cycling system. In this system, the concentrations of the cycling intermediates and by-products increase exponentially with time, and, at any given time, are linear functions of the initial concentrations of the cycling intermediates. The systems may be useful as biochemical amplifiers in analytical techniques, and a simple modification of the systems gives systems that are potentially operative in vivo as components of some types of biochemical regulatory systems."

https://openalex.org/W1561235054,"Factors which control the rate of synthesis of two distinct classes of protein, globin and non-globin proteins, by free reticulocyte ribosomes have been investigated. Three different inhibitors of protein synthesis, puromycin, cycloheximide, and hydroxylamine, were more effective in inhibiting the synthesis of globin than of non-globin protein by free reticulocyte ribosomes in the cell-free system. In contrast to the different degree of response to puromycin by free ribosomes in synthesizing globin and non-globin proteins, template activity for both classes of protein decreased at similar rates during maturation of reticulocytes in vivo and during storage of reticulocyte ribosomes at 0°. The synthesis of non-globin protein by either free or membrane-bound ribosomes was similar in that puromycin inhibited both to the same degree. The findings indicate that template activity for globin and non-globin protein in reticulocytes is not directed by a contiguous polycistronic messenger RNA, and suggest that the two classes of protein are not synthesized on the same ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1589668308,"Abstract As part of a study of the regulation of aspartate aminotransferase isozymes (EC 2.6.1.1), we have investigated the characteristics of inhibition of the anionic and cationic isozymes by d-erythrose 4-phosphate and glycolaldehyde phosphate, the naturally occurring homologues of d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Erythrose-4-P has been found to be a time-dependent inhibitor of both the cationic and anionic isozymes. The inhibitor dissociation constants and types of inhibition were determined from residual enzyme activity after equilibration of each isozyme with the inhibitor and one substrate in the preliminary incubation mixtures. Inhibition of both isozymes by erythrose-4-P was completely competitive with respect to α-ketoglutarate and completely noncompetitive with respect to aspartate. The Ki values of the cationic isozyme were 1.44 and 0.135 mm for the pyridoxal and pyridoxamine forms, respectively. The Ki values of the anionic isozyme were 3.04 and 0.33 mm for the pyridoxal and pyridoxamine forms, respectively. Both forms of the cationic isozyme were more sensitive to inhibition than the corresponding forms of the anionic isozyme. Inhibition of aspartate aminotransferase isozymes by glycolaldehyde-P was complete and not time-dependent. Inhibition was competitive with respect to α-ketoglutarate as the variable substrate and uncompetitive with respect to aspartate as the variable substrate. The Ki values were 1.07 and 0.79 mm for the pyridoxamine form of the cationic and anionic isozymes, respectively. The characteristics of the inhibition of aspartate aminotransferase isozymes by erythrose-4-P, glyceraldehyde-3-P, and glycolaldehyde-P are not related to number of carbon atoms in these compounds. Kinetic analyses of the binding of glycolaldehyde-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P to the isozymes showed that their binding is mutually exclusive. The results suggest that glyceraldehyde-3-P and its naturally occurring homologues erythrose-4-P and glycolaldehyde-P may be involved in the regulation of gluconeogenesis in vivo by affecting the activity of the isozymes of aspartate aminotransferase."
