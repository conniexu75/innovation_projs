https://openalex.org/W1967004332,"The promoter regions of several phorbol diester-(TPA-) inducible genes (collagenase, stromelysin, hMT IIA, and SV40) share a conserved 9 bp motif. Synthetic copies of these closely related sequences conferred TPA inducibility upon heterologous promoters. Footprinting analysis indicated that these TPA-responsive elements (TREs) are recognized by a common cellular protein: the previously described transcription factor AP-1. A point mutation that eliminated the basal and induced activity of the TRE also interfered with its ability to bind AP-1. Treatment of cultured cells with TPA led to a rapid 3- to 4-fold increase in TRE binding activity, by a posttranslational mechanism. These results strongly suggest that AP-1 is at the receiving end of a complex pathway responsible for transmitting the effects of phorbol ester tumor promoters from the plasma membrane to the transcriptional machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2081135713,"The enhancer-binding protein AP-1 has been purified to greater than 95% homogeneity from HeLa cells by sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography and identified as a 47 kd polypeptide. Purified AP-1 activates transcription in vitro of the wild-type human metallothionein IIA (hMT IIA) gene but not mutant hMT IIA promoters lacking AP-1 recognition sites. DNAase I protection analysis indicates that genetically defined enhancer elements in hMT IIA, SV40, and the human collagenase gene contain high-affinity AP-1-binding sites, each with a conserved recognition motif, TGACTCA. These three genes are transcriptionally induced by treatment of cells with the tumor promoter TPA. Here we demonstrate that multiple synthetic copies of the consensus AP-1-binding site can act as TPA-inducible enhancers in various plasmid constructs after transfection into HeLa cells. These findings suggest that AP-1 is a transcription factor that functions by interacting with a specific enhancer element, and that its activities may be modulated by treatment of cells with TPA, known to stimulate protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W2021608281,"Fragments of exogenous DNA that range in size up to several hundred kilobase pairs have been cloned into yeast by ligating them to vector sequences that allow their propagation as linear artificial chromosomes. Individual clones of yeast and human DNA that have been analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis appear to represent faithful replicas of the source DNA. The efficiency with which clones can be generated is high enough to allow the construction of comprehensive libraries from the genomes of higher organisms. By offering a tenfold increase in the size of the DNA molecules that can be cloned into a microbial host, this system addresses a major gap in existing experimental methods for analyzing complex DNA sources."

https://openalex.org/W1541486667,"Natural human and recombinant human and murine tumor necrosis factors (TNF) were fractionated by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-75. The active form of TNF was identified by its inhibitory activity in receptor binding assays with HeLa cells and was eluted as a protein of Mr approximately 55,000. Radioiodinated human and murine TNF were fractionated by gel filtration into a major peak of Mr approximately 55,000, corresponding to a trimer, and a minor peak of Mr approximately 17,000, corresponding to a monomer. Binding assays showed that the timer was at least 8-fold more active than the monomer. The human TNF partially dissociated into monomers upon addition of the nonionic detergent Triton X-100. Isolated monomers showed low binding affinity (KD = 70 nM) and reduced cytotoxicity, whereas trimers showed high binding affinity (KD = 90 pM) and cytotoxicity. When 125I-TNF was bound to cells, no release of monomer was detectable, suggesting that the trimer could directly bind to cellular receptors without dissociating into subunits. Further evidence for such binding was obtained by cross-linking 125I-TNF trimers with bis[2-(succinimidooxycarbonyloxy)ethyl]sulfone. These trimers were bound to HeLa cells, could be dissociated from cellular receptors, and elicited a cytotoxic response. These results show that trimers, whether native or cross-linked, bind to receptors and are the biologically active form of TNF."

https://openalex.org/W1582315378,"Reversible calcium-dependent association with a particulate fraction from human placenta was used as the first step in the purification of substrates for the epidermal growth factor-stimulated protein kinase. A protein with apparent Mr of 35,000 was purified to homogeneity, and the sequence was determined for approximately one-fourth of the protein. These residues could be aligned exactly with the previously published sequence of lipocortin I derived from the cDNA from a human lymphoma. Two other proteins that appear to be formed by proteolytic removal of 12 or 26 of the amino acids from the NH2 terminus of the protein also were isolated. Placental lipocortin I was phosphorylated in Tyr-21 in an epidermal growth factor-dependent manner by the kinase activity in a particulate fraction from A431 cells; half-maximal phosphorylation occurred at 50 nM lipocortin I. Lipocortin I phosphorylated on Tyr-21 was approximately 10-fold more sensitive to tryptic cleavage at Lys-26 than was the native protein. Placental lipocortin I and its two truncated forms were potent inhibitors of pancreatic phospholipase A2 activity. Another 33-kDa protein that was not related immunologically to lipocortin I or lipocortin II (calpactin I) also was purified from the EGTA extract of placenta. The unidentified protein inhibited phospholipase A2 but was not a substrate for the epidermal growth factor-stimulated kinase. The mechanism by which these proteins inhibit phospholipase A2 activity was investigated. Attempts to detect direct interaction between these proteins and the enzyme were unsuccessful. However, both the unidentified protein, lipocortin I, and 32P-labeled lipocortin I bound in a Ca2+-dependent manner to the [3H]oleic acid-labeled Escherichia coli membranes used as substrate in the phospholipase A2 assay. Heparin, which is known to block lipocortin I inhibition of phospholipase A2, also blocked binding of lipocortin I to E. coli membranes. The results of these and other experiments raise the possibility that placental lipocortin I inhibits phospholipase A2 activity in this assay by coating the phospholipid and thereby blocking interaction of enzyme and substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1581263435,"A consensus recognition sequence for RNA polymerase was created at the positively regulated lambda Pre promoter by introducing three single base pair mutations. This altered promoter, Pre*, functions constitutively in vivo and in vitro at high efficiency despite very poor consensus region sequence homology. We examined the influence of the -35 region sequence information on promoter function by shifting the wild type -35 region +/- 2 base pairs relative to the -10 region consensus sequence and by completely replacing it with alternative DNA sequences. In every case, the altered Pre* promoters retained transcriptional activity although differences in their transcriptional efficiencies were observed. Apparently the Pre* promoter does not require specific -35 region sequences for constitutive promoter activity, although the -35 region sequences can modulate overall promoter strength. In addition, by point mutation analysis we have identified bases immediately upstream of the -10 hexamer which are essential for constitutive function of the Pre* promoter. We propose that these mutants define an extended -10 region at Pre* that compensates for its poor -35 region sequence information by providing critical contacts that stabilize productive RNA polymerase binding."
https://openalex.org/W1746773314,"A single polypeptide is shown to act both as the beta subunit of the proline hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.2) and as a protein disulfide-isomerase (EC 5.3.4.1). When isolated from chick embryos or rat liver, the beta subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and the enzyme protein disulfide-isomerase have identical molecular weights and peptide maps as produced by digestion with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The apparent molecular weights of both proteins isolated from human placental tissue are slightly higher, and the human beta subunit and one of its peptides have molecular weights about Mr 500 higher than the protein disulfide-isomerase and its corresponding peptide. Experiments with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies also suggest a structural identity between the two proteins. The beta subunit isolated from the prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer has protein disulfide-isomerase activity similar to protein disulfide-isomerase itself, and even the beta subunit when present in the prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer has one-half of this activity."

https://openalex.org/W1496912643,"Heme oxygenase, an essential enzyme of heme catabolism, is inducible by its substrate heme, by heavy metals, and by various other substances. To study the molecular mechanisms of the induction of heme oxygenase, we isolated the heme oxygenase gene from a rat genomic DNA library using cloned cDNA as hybridization probes and determined its complete nucleotide sequence. The gene is composed of 6830 nucleotides, and is organized in four introns and five exons. The transcription initiation site was identified by S1 nuclease mapping analysis. Using HeLa cell lysate, we confirmed that the transcription of cloned heme oxygenase gene is initiated accurately at the assigned initiation site. In the 5'-flanking region of the heme oxygenase gene, we found several potential binding sites for different transcription factors: a transcription factor Sp1, a positive regulator for the control of amino acid synthesis (GCN4), a heat shock transcription factor, and a metal-dependent transcription factor. Furthermore, the intron 1 contains the sequence that shows about 65% homology to that of the neuronal identifier sequence, a possible enhancer element."
https://openalex.org/W2073705755,Bacterial flagella are driven by a rotary motor that utilizes the free energy stored in the electrochemical proton gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane to do mechanical work. The flux of protons coupled to motor rotation was measured in Streptococcus and found to be directly proportional to motor speed. This supports the hypothesis that the movement of protons through the motor is tightly coupled to the rotation of its flagellar filament. Under this assumption the efficiency of energy conversion is close to unity at the low speeds encountered in tethered cells but only a few percent at the high speeds encountered in swimming cells. This difference appears to be due to dissipation by processes internal to the motor. The efficiency at high speeds exhibits a steep temperature dependence and a sizable deuterium solvent isotope effect.
https://openalex.org/W1559556161,"Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) activate phospholipase C via a guanine nucleotide regulatory (G) protein. Pretreatment of the PMNs with pertussis toxin (PT) or 4-beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) inhibited chemoattractant-induced inositol trisphosphate generation. To determine the loci of inhibition by PT and PMA, G protein-mediated reactions in PMN plasma membranes were examined. Plasma membranes prepared from untreated and PMA-treated PMNs demonstrated equivalent ability of a GTP analogue to suppress high affinity binding of the chemoattractant-N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe) to its receptor. The rate, but not the extent, of high affinity binding of GTP gamma[35S] to untreated PMN membranes was stimulated up to 2-fold by preincubation with 1 microM fMet-Leu-Phe. The ability of fMet-Leu-Phe to stimulate the rate of GTP gamma S binding was absent in membranes prepared from PT-treated PMNs, but remained intact in membranes from PMA-treated cells. Hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) via phospholipase C could be activated in untreated PMN membranes by either fMet-Leu-Phe plus GTP or GTP gamma S alone at low concentrations of Ca2+ (0.1-1 microM). Membranes prepared from PT-treated PMNs degraded PIP2 upon exposure to GTP gamma S, but not fMet-Leu-Phe plus GTP. In contrast, membranes prepared from phorbol ester-treated PMNs did not hydrolyze PIP2 when incubated with GTP gamma S. Treatment with PT or PMA did not affect the ability of 1 mM Ca2+ to activate PIP2 hydrolysis in PMN membranes, indicating that neither treatment directly inactivated phospholipase C. Therefore, PT appears to block coupling of the chemoattractant receptors to G protein activation, while phorbol esters disrupt coupling of the activated G protein to phospholipase C. The phorbol ester-mediated effect may mimic a negative feedback signal induced by protein kinase C activation by diacylglycerol generated upon activation of phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W2039183968,"The present studies show that hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond, most likely ATP, is a distinct, second step required to complete import of the F1-ATPase beta-subunit into the mitochondria. This step follows a membrane potential-dependent first step. We show, using an inhibitor of adenine nucleotide transport and the analogue beta,gamma-AMP-PCP, that the activity required for this phosphodiester hydrolysis-dependent completion of protein import resides outside the mitochondrial inner membrane. This activity is proposed to act on the precursor at the site of translocation either to render it competent or to catalyze its vectorial movement directly through the import apparatus. This activity shares properties ascribed to proteins of the heat-shock family, which are proposed to participate in the ATP-dependent refolding of partially denatured proteins and nascent peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2035228941,"The herpes simplex virus 1 genome consists of one long and one short stretch of unique sequences flanked by inverted repeat sequences. The nucleotide sequence and RNA map predict 12 open reading frames designated as US1 through US12 within the short stretch of unique sequences. This paper reports the construction of virus mutants from which US2, US3, or US4 had been deleted that are capable of growth in cell culture. One of the three deleted genes, US4, specifies the viral envelope glycoprotein G. Mutants with deletions in US1, US8, US9, US10, US11, and US12 have been previously reported. The nine genes deleted from this region form two clusters, US1 through US4 and US8 through US12, and encode at least two and possibly more structural proteins. The presence of so many genes dispensable for growth in cell culture suggests several hypotheses regarding their function and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2079134008,"The art/trs transactivator protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was expressed in mammalian cells as a 19-kilodalton protein that was immunoreactive with sera from HIV-infected patients. Separate plasmids encoding the art/trs protein, the tat protein, or the envelope glycoprotein gp120 were used to demonstrate that both art/trs and tat are absolutely required for the synthesis of gp120 from its cognate messenger RNA. In addition, both the tat and art/trs proteins influence the level of envelope RNA. The results suggest that art/trs and tat may be ideal targets for potential anti-HIV agents in AIDS therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1605117055,"Initiation of bidirectional replication from the origin of the Escherichia coli chromosome (oriC) proceeds through stages in which the components of the two replication forks are assembled. From a complex containing proteins dnaA, dnaB, and dnaC bound at oriC, the dnaB helicase moves in both directions to unwind the duplex. In the absence of replication, this unwinding generates a bubble at oriC coated by single strand binding protein. Addition of gyrase allows unwinding to proceed extensively in both directions from oriC at 60 base pairs/s/fork at 37 degrees C. This rate is sharply dependent on temperature and also stimulated by both primase and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, even in the absence of DNA synthesis. Primer and DNA synthesis are efficient when coupled to template unwinding. DNA synthesis proceeds bidirectionally from oriC at a rate limited by unwinding. With extensive unwinding preceding DNA synthesis, initiations are not limited to oriC."
https://openalex.org/W2051623956,"The structural basis for agonist-mediated sequestration and desensitization of the β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) was examined by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the hamster βAR gene and expression of the mutant genes in mouse L cells. Treatment of these cells with the agonist isoproterenol corresponded to a desensitization of βAR activity. A mutant receptor that bound agonist but did not couple to adenylate cyclase showed a dramatically reduced sequestration response to agonist stimulation. In contrast, βAR mutants in which the C-terminus was truncated and/or in which two regions that have been proposed as phosphorylation substrates for cAMP-dependent protein kinase were removed showed normal sequestration responses. These results demonstrate that agonist-mediated sequestration of the βAR can occur in the absence of the C-terminus of the protein and reveal a strong correlation between effective coupling to Gs and sequestration."

https://openalex.org/W1976619281,"The E. coli lac operator and repressor were adapted for function in mammalian cells. Plasmids containing an SV40 early region (pSVlacO) or a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene (pSVlacOCAT) linked to a hybrid SV40 early promoter bearing a lac operator were tested for function. Identical plasmids lacking an operator (pX-8 and pX-8CAT) were controls. In vitro, early transcription from pSVlacO, but not from pX-8, was inhibited by lac repressor, and repression was overcome by IPTG. Repression of large T synthesis or CAT activity occurred in vivo only when the respective operator-containing plasmid was cotransfected with a plasmid encoding lac repressor, or when the recipient cells stably synthesized lac repressor. IPTG substantially relieved repression in both cases. CAT enzyme repression was paralleled by a decrease in CAT mRNA abundance. Thus regulatory elements of the lac operon function physiologically in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2020897806,"The large genome of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encodes at least 80 polypeptides, the majority of which have no recognized function. A subgroup of these gene products appears to be nonessential for virus replication in cell culture, but contributes to the complex life cycle of the virus in the host. To identify such functions, a simple insertional mutagenesis method has been used for selective inactivation of individual HSV-1 genes. The bacterial transposon Tn5 was allowed to insert randomly into cloned restriction fragments representing the entire short unique (US) region of the HSV-1 genome. Of the 12 open reading frames that were mutagenized with Tn5, mutant derivatives of US2, US4, and US5 were recombined into the virus. These three genes proved to be nonessential for HSV-1 replication in Vero (African Green monkey kidney) cells and the US4 gene appeared to be involved in viral pathogenesis in the central nervous system of mice. This rapid mutagenesis procedure should prove useful in exploring the entire HSV-1 genome as well as the genomes of other complex animal viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1507218517,"Two forms of protein phosphatase which dephosphorylate cardiac myosin or myosin light chains and the inhibitory subunit of cardiac troponin were purified from bovine cardiac muscle. The enzymes were composed of subunits of Mr = 63,000, 55,000, and 38,000 in a 1:1:1 molar ratio (PT-1) or Mr = 63,000 and 38,000 in a 1:1 molar ratio (PT-2). Native gel electrophoresis and sucrose gradient sedimentation indicated that activity toward all three substrates was due to a single enzyme species. A monoclonal antibody and polyclonal antiserum directed against an Mr = 38,000 protein phosphatase from this tissue specifically reacted with the Mr = 38,000 subunit of PT-1 and PT-2. The specificity of antibodies for the Mr = 38,000 subunit indicated that it was distinct from the other subunits. The Mr = 63,000 subunits of PT-1 and PT-2 were identical based on mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and one-dimensional peptide maps. Specificity of antiserum against the Mr = 55,000 subunit of PT-1 showed that this subunit was a distinct protein and not derived from the Mr = 63,000 subunit by proteolysis. PT-2 but not PT-1 could interact with antiserum against the Mr = 38,000 catalytic subunit in competitive immunoassays indicating that the presence of the Mr = 55,000 subunit may alter or mask antigenic site(s). Analysis of the enzymatic properties of PT-1 and PT-2 showed that PT-2 had higher activity with myosin, myosin light chains, and phosphorylase while PT-1 had higher activity with troponin. The results indicate that the presence of the Mr = 55,000 subunit may alter the enzymatic properties of the catalytic subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1964892965,"We investigated the role of the L3T4 molecule in mitogen and antigen-initiated signal transduction in the L3T4(+) murine T cell hybridoma, 3DT52.5.9 and an L3T4(−) variant, 3DT52.5.24. Both Concanavalin A (Con A) and specific antigen stimulated increases in cytosolic-free calcium ([Ca2+]i), phosphatidylinositol turnover, and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in both cell lines. About 85% of the stimulated rise in [Ca2+]i was from an extracellular source. Anti-L3T4 monoclonal antibody (MAb) inhibited 90% of antigen-and 50% of Con A-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i and IL-2 production but had no effect on the ability of either activation signal to stimulate phosphatidylinositol turnover in the parent L3T4(+) cells. Stimulus-response coupling in the L3T4(−) cells was unaffected by the MAb. The anti-L3T4-insensitive increase in [Ca2+]i induced by Con A was inhibited by EGTA, suggesting that this mitogen also stimulated an influx of Ca2+ via an additional transport mechanism distinct from that stimulated by antigen. The fact that anti-L3T4 antibodies inhibit antigen and Con A-stimulated Ca2+ transport and IL-2 production without affecting phosphatidylinositol turnover suggests that L3T4 may play a critical role in modulating the activation of the T cell receptor-associated Ca2+ transporter in T cell stimulus-response coupling."
https://openalex.org/W1611167266,"Abstract The sequence specificity of human skin fibroblast collagenase has been investigated by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of 16 synthetic octapeptides covering the P4 through P4' subsites of the substrate. The choice of peptides was patterned after potential collagenase cleavage sites (those containing either the Gly-Leu-Ala or Gly-Ile-Ala sequences) found in types I, II, and III collagens. The initial rate of hydrolysis of the P1-P1' bond of each peptide has been measured by quantitating the concentration of amino groups produced upon cleavage after reaction with fluorescamine. The reactions have been carried out under first-order conditions ([S] much less than KM) and kcat/KM values have been calculated from the initial rates. The amino acids in subsites P3 (Pro, Ala, Leu, or Asn), P2 (Gln, Leu, Hyp, Arg, Asp, or Val), P1' (Ile or Leu), and P4' (Gln, Thr, His, Ala, or Pro) all influence the hydrolysis rates. However, the differences in the relative rates observed for these octapeptides cannot in themselves explain why fibroblast collagenase hydrolyzes only the Gly-Leu and Gly-Ile bonds found at the cleavage site of native collagens. This supports the notion that the local structure of collagen is important in determining the location of the mammalian collagenase cleavage site."
https://openalex.org/W2045718752,"A new human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-4) was recently described in healthy people from Senegal. This virus has many properties in common with members of the human T-lymphotropic viruses, particularly the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV, the etiologic agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), but does not appear to be associated with immunodeficiency-related disorders. In the present study, serum samples were obtained from 4248 individuals from six West African countries, including Senegal, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, and Ivory Coast. These samples, collected during 1985-1987, were from people categorized as healthy control, sexually active risk, and disease populations. All samples were analyzed for reactivity to HTLV-4 and HIV by radioimmunoprecipitation-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Evidence for HTLV-4 infection was found in five of the six countries. The seroprevalence varied markedly from country to country. Healthy sexually active individuals in the risk category had the highest levels of HTLV-4 infection compared to individuals in the healthy control category and the disease category, the latter including AIDS patients. The seroprevalence of HIV infection in most of these countries was quite low, although tightly associated with the rare cases of AIDS. The biology of HTLV-4 infection thus differs from that of HIV in Central Africa or the United States and Europe. The presence of these viruses and their different pathogenicities in several countries of West Africa indicate the necessity for serologic assays that will distinguish between them. Further studies of their origin and distribution as well as of their biology will be important in advancing our understanding of AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2114355849,"The O2(-)-forming respiratory burst oxidase is present in a dormant state in a fully soluble system containing both cytosol and a deoxycholate extract of membranes from resting human neutrophils. Sodium dodecyl sulfate at low concentrations converts this soluble dormant oxidase into its catalytically active form. The Vmax for the activated oxidase was 2.1 mumol of O2-/min/mg of membrane protein. Michaelis constants for NADPH and NADH (38 microM and 1.7 mM, respectively) were similar to those measured previously in other systems. Oxidase activity was not detected after sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment of systems containing solubilized neutrophil membranes obtained from patients with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease. These results suggest that the deoxycholate extract contains both the resting oxidase and those membrane-associated components needed for its activation, all in functioning states."
https://openalex.org/W1547505742,"Using human adipose stromal cells in monolayer culture as a model system for study of the regulation of aromatase activity, as well as polyclonal antibodies raised in this laboratory against aromatase cytochrome P-450 (cytochrome P-450AROM), it was found that the rate of synthesis of cytochrome P-450AROM was stimulated by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. This stimulation was attenuated by epidermal growth factor and was potentiated by phorbol esters. These changes in cytochrome P-450AROM synthesis were associated with comparable changes in the levels of translatable cytochrome P-450AROM mRNA, as well as with changes in the activity of aromatase of these cells. By contrast, there was little change in the synthesis of the reductase component of the aromatase enzyme complex in response to these factors. The increase in mRNA was blocked by cycloheximide, indicative of a requirement for protein synthesis in mediating this inductive response. It is concluded that aromatase activity is regulated primarily by changes in the level of mRNA encoding cytochrome P-450AROM, and that such changes are likely a reflection of changes in the rate of transcription of the gene encoding this enzyme. Increases in the levels of cytochrome P-450AROM mRNA are apparently mediated by a regulatory protein(s), similar to that found for other steroidogenic forms of cytochrome P-450."
https://openalex.org/W1542255581,"Abstract Stimulation of growth hormone gene transcription in several rat pituitary cell lines (e.g. GC and GH1) is mediated by a thyroid hormone nuclear receptor which is a DNA binding protein. We report that these cell lines contain nuclear proteins which selectively interact with sequences found within the first 236 base pairs of 5'-flanking DNA of the rat growth hormone gene. Sequences found between -104 and -49 base pairs, relative to the transcription initiation (cap) site, bind to nuclear protein(s) which appears to be cell type specific and generate a DNase I-resistant footprint on both strands between -95 and -68. A distinct protein component(s) selectively binds to DNA between -236 and -146 but is not cell type specific. These regions correspond to those found in gene transfer studies to be important in mediating basal expression (-104/+7) and thyroid hormone-regulated expression (-236/-146) of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1599220161,"The 12-base pair (bp) tandem direct repeat sequences (DR2) at the joint region (a sequence) of herpes simplex virus type 1 (strain F) adopt a new type of DNA conformation under the influence of negative supercoiling. The novel conformation is dependent on the number of the DR2 repeats; the 19 mer (228 bp total) and the 14 mer (168 bp) readily form the alternate structure whereas pentamer, trimer, and dimer repeats show somewhat different properties. S1 and P1 nuclease studies reveal that the new conformation has a major structural aberration at its center and conformational periodicities which are not identical on the complementary strands. Also, the effect of salt and pH, the location of reaction with bromo- and chloroacetaldehyde, the type of sequence (direct repeat) involved, and the nature and extent of supercoil-induced relaxations demonstrate that this structure differs from previously recognized conformations including left-handed Z helices, cruciforms, bent DNA, and slipped structures. We propose the existence of a novel conformation, anisomorphic DNA, with different structures on the complementary strands which elicit a structural aberration at the physical center of the tandem sequences. Since the oligopurine X oligopyrimidine sequence may be inherently inflexible, this supercoil-induced structural change and the physical stress on these inserts in recombinant plasmids tend to deform (crack) the DR2 sequences at their centers. Possible roles for anisomorphic DNA in the functions of this segment of intense biological activity are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1589122426,"The Trg protein mediates chemotactic response of Escherichia coli to the attractants ribose and galactose. Like other transducers, Trg is a transmembrane protein that undergoes post-translational covalent modification. The modifications are hydrolysis (deamidation) of certain glutamine side chains to create glutamate residues and methylation of specific glutamates to form carboxyl methyl esters. Analysis of radiolabeled, tryptic peptides by high performance liquid chromatography and gas-phase sequencing allowed direct identification of the modified residues of Trg. The protein has 5 methyl-accepting residues. Four, at positions 304, 310, 311, and 318, are contained in a 23-residue tryptic peptide ending in lysine. The fifth, at position 500, is within a 25-residue tryptic peptide ending in arginine. At two sites, 311 and 318, glutamines are deamidated to create methyl-accepting glutamates. There is not a required order of modification among the sites. However, there is a substantial preference for methylation on the arginine peptide and, among sites on the lysine peptide, for the middle pair. Comparison of sequences surrounding modified residues identified in this work for Trg and previously for Tsr and Tar suggests a consensus sequence for methyl-accepting sites of Ala/Ser-Xaa-Xaa-Glu-Glu*-Xaa-Ala/OH-Ala-OH/Ala, where OH signifies Ser or Thr and the asterick marks the site of modification."
https://openalex.org/W2000712906,"Readthrough viral transcripts are present at relatively high levels in cells infected with avian leukosis virus. It has been proposed that they can function as intermediates in the transduction of proto-oncogenes by retroviruses. It is shown here, by the analysis of viruses containing a mutation in the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal, that readthrough RNAs have the requisite properties to function as transduction intermediates: readthrough RNAs were polyadenylated and packaged as efficiently as normal viral RNA, RNAs nearly 11.2 kilobases (3.5 kilobases larger than wild-type avian leukosis virus genomes) were present in virions of the mutant virus, and virus particles containing both readthrough and normal genomes were most likely infectious."
https://openalex.org/W1584846820,"Canine cardiac myocytes contain two distinct molecular forms of the Na,K-ATPase catalytic subunit. They are resolved by gel electrophoresis and identified using immunological techniques. The apparent molecular weights of the catalytic subunits are 95,000 (alpha) and 98,000 (alpha +). As judged by [3H]ouabain-binding measurements and Na,K-ATPase assays, the two forms are active and differ by a factor of 150 in their respective affinity for digitalis (ouabain and digitoxigenin). The dissociation constant of the high affinity form (alpha +) is KD, 2 nM, and that of the low affinity molecular form (alpha) is KD, 300 nM. According to both enzymatic and binding assays, up to 70% of maximum inhibition is caused by occupation of the high affinity sites (alpha +). Inasmuch as the pharmacological and toxic concentrations of digitalis in dog are 1 and 200 nM, respectively, and as maximum inhibition of Na+ pump in vivo should not exceed 80% to avoid toxicity (Akera, T. and Brody, T. (1982) Annu. Rev.

Examination of strains having a single chromosomal copy of the gene encoding the Arg-77 protein indicated that the altered protein was synthesized at the normal rate and that it had normal or near normal activity in vivo. Examination of enzymatic activities in vitro with cytochrome b2, cytochrome c peroxidase, and cytochrome c oxidase indicated that the altered iso-1-cytochrome c has equal or enhanced catalytic efficiencies. Thus, replacement of the evolutionarily conserved residue Lys-77 produces no or only minor effects both in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1515167928,"The structural genes of the Pseudomonas oleovorans alk (alkane utilization) system, which are localized on the alkBAC operon, were cloned as a 16.9-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment. We have measured the length and determined the position of the alkBAC operon on this fragment by electron microscopy of R-loops. Furthermore, the 7.3-kilobase pair long alkBAC operon was analyzed for translation products in Escherichia coli minicells. Using a spectrum of overlapping subclones, six different proteins were identified. Starting from the alkBAC promotor, these polypeptides had molecular masses of 41, 15, 49, 58, 59, and 20 kDa, respectively. The 41-kDa protein was identified as alkane hydroxylase by reaction with a specific antibody. The 15- and 49-kDa peptides are soluble components of the alkane hydroxylase complex. The 58-kDa protein is most likely involved in alkanol dehydrogenase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1523040418,"Photosensitive dyes representative of the thiazines, xanthenes, acridines, and phenazines mediated phototoxicity in Escherichia coli B. The observed phototoxicity was sensitizer-, light-, and oxygen-dependent and is therefore a photodynamic effect. Hydroxyl radical scavengers conferred protection against the photodynamic action of all of the representative dyes. The extent of protection was dependent on the concentration of scavenger and on the in vitro reactivity of the scavenger with the hydroxyl radical. Exogenous superoxide dismutase and catalase partially protected the cells against the dye-mediated phototoxicity, and prior induction of intracellular superoxide dismutase and catalase by growth in glucose minimal medium containing manganese and paraquat substantially protected E. coli B against the photodynamic action of all of the dyes examined. Combinations of protective treatments against the phototoxicity of all four classes of dyes, including superoxide dismutase and catalase preinduction and addition of extracellular superoxide dismutase and catalase or the addition of hydroxyl radical scavengers, provided nearly complete protection against the oxygen-dependent component of dye-mediated lethality. E. coli B grown in glucose minimal medium containing manganese and photosensitive dyes induced manganese superoxide dismutase. The extent of induction was correlated with the dyes' ability to photooxidize NADH in vitro. Thus, oxygen radicals are primarily responsible for the oxygen-dependent toxicity of the photosensitive dyes examined, and one adaptive response of E. coli B to a dye-mediated oxidative threat is to induce superoxide dismutase."
https://openalex.org/W1506172359,"The genomes of mammalian mitochondria are duplex DNA circles. The two major transcriptional promoters and the origin of DNA replication for one DNA strand are located in a single region which contains no structural genes and occupies about 6% of the genome. This region is called the displacement loop (D-loop) region since it is often found as a novel triplex structure in which the heavy strand of the genome has been partially replicated. This nascent single-stranded DNA segment remains hybridized to the light strand, displacing the heavy strand of the genome over much of the D-loop region. The promoters and the sites of initiation of D-loop DNA synthesis have been mapped in the human and mouse genomes and may show limited sequence conservation. We have mapped these sites in the bovine mitochondrial genome. Some features are conserved between all three species; however, the promoters and the sites of initiation of D-loop DNA synthesis show no primary sequence homology among all species. This lack of sequence homology is in contrast to the greater than 80% sequence conservation which has been reported in portions of the D-loop region which are located distal to the origin of DNA replication and far from the transcriptional promoters. These results imply that closely related species may have developed different means of controlling mitochondrial gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1516415700,"Nodulation genes in Rhizobium are required for invasion of the host plant. The nodABC operon is induced by plant activator molecules; this activation requires the gene product of the constitutively expressed nodD locus, which is transcribed divergently from nodABC. We are employing in vitro transcription to elucidate the molecular mechanism of nod gene activation. We used a micropurification technique to obtain RNA polymerase from Rhizobium meliloti, and here demonstrate that it initiated and terminated accurately at the Escherichia coli trp promoter-leader region. E. coli RNA polymerase, however, apparently fails to recognize R. meliloti promoters. We used the R. meliloti RNA polymerase in a minimal transcription system to attempt to localize the divergent start sites for nodD and nodABC. Transcript sizing and fingerprinting, together with synchronized single-round transcription experiments permit us to designate an in vitro transcription initiation site for nodD. Primer extension analysis of in vivo mRNA demonstrates that the initiation site which is utilized in vitro is the same site used in vivo. While nodABC is not transcribed in our minimal in vitro transcription system, this system should prove useful for the study of factors in induced cells which promote expression of this inducible promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1579446995,"Two different hydrogenases have been isolated from Clostridium pasteurianum W5. Hydrogenase II (uptake) is active in H2 oxidation while hydrogenase I (bidirectional) is active both in H2 oxidation and evolution. Previous EPR and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) studies of oxidized hydrogenase I have now been complemented by analogous studies on oxidized 57Fe-enriched hydrogenase II and its CO derivative (using 12CO and 13CO). Binding of CO greatly changes the EPR spectrum of oxidized hydrogenase II, and use of 13CO leads to resolved hyperfine splitting from interaction with a single 13CO molecule (AC approximately 34 MHz). This coupling is over 50% larger than that seen for hydrogenase I. 57Fe ENDOR disclosed two types of iron site in both oxidized hydrogenase II and its CO derivative. Combination of EPR, ENDOR, and Mossbauer results shows that site 1 has AFe1 = 18 MHz shifting to approximately 30 MHz upon CO binding and consisting of two Fe atoms and site 2 has A2 approximately 7 MHz shifting to approximately 10 MHz and containing a single Fe. These results are very similar to those seen for hydrogenase I, which indicates that a structurally similar 3Fe cluster, believed to be the catalytically active site, is present in both. Proton ENDOR shows a solvent exchangeable resonance only in the CO derivative of hydrogenase II. This indicates a structural difference between hydrogenases I and II that is brought out by CO binding. No evidence of 14N coordination to the cluster is seen for either enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1638703855,"Human prothrombin cDNA has been expressed in mammalian cells to yield biologically active, fully gamma-carboxylated prothrombin. A 2.0-kilobase cDNA encoding full-length prothrombin was isolated from a human fetal liver library using a cDNA fragment recovered from a lambda gt11 human hepatoma expression library. Prothrombin cDNA was cloned into a mammalian expression vector and transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells. Selection for expression of dihydrofolate reductase yielded cell lines secreting up to 0.55 microgram/ml of prothrombin. Recombinant prothrombin synthesized in the presence of vitamin K was quantitatively recovered from tissue culture medium by affinity chromatography using conformation-specific antibodies directed against the metal-stabilized, gamma-carboxylated conformer. The purified material migrated as a single band on denaturing polyacrylamide gels with an electrophoretic mobility equivalent to that of plasma-derived human prothrombin. Automated Edman degradation of recombinant prothrombin revealed a single amino-terminal sequence identical to that of plasma-derived prothrombin. Recombinant and plasma-derived prothrombin interacted similarly with antibodies specific for total prothrombin, abnormal des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin, and two metal-stabilized conformers of prothrombin. Recombinant prothrombin exhibited a specific coagulant activity equivalent to that of plasma-derived prothrombin. The gamma-carboxyglutamic acid analysis of recombinant prothrombin demonstrated 9.9 +/- 0.4 mol of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid/mol of prothrombin. These results represent the first description of the expression of a recombinant vitamin K-dependent protein in which all of the expressed protein is gamma-carboxylated."
https://openalex.org/W1591127765,"An in vitro system was developed to study the biosynthesis of enterobacterial common antigen (ECA). Membranes of Escherichia coli were found to possess an enzyme activity that catalyzes the transfer of UDP-N-acetyl-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate from UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to an endogenous lipid acceptor according to the reaction UDP-GlcNAc + P-lipid----GlcNAc-PP-lipid + UMP. The lipid-linked product was tentatively identified as GlcNAc-pyrophosphorylundecaprenol (lipid I) based on a comparison of its chemical and chromatographic properties with those of authentic GlcNAc-pyrophosphorylundecaprenol. The enzyme was dependent on the presence of Mg2+ for activity, and the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme was totally inhibited by the antibiotic tunicamycin in both the forward and reverse directions. Incubation of membranes with both UDP-N-acetylmannosaminuronic acid (UDP-ManNAcA) and UDP-GlcNAc resulted in the conversion of lipid I to a more polar compound, lipid II. The synthesis of lipid II was dependent on prior synthesis of lipid I. Characterization of the saccharide moiety of lipid II resulted in the identification of this compound as ManNAcA-GlcNAc-pyrophosphorylundecaprenol."
https://openalex.org/W1517607886,"The adenylyl cyclase system of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains the CYR1 polypeptide, responsible for catalyzing formation of cAMP from ATP, and two RAS polypeptides, responsible for stimulation of cAMP synthesis by guanine nucleotides. We have determined hydrodynamic properties of yeast adenylyl cyclase in taurocholate extracts of wild type and RAS-deficient membranes. In taurocholate extracts of both kinds of membranes, the enzyme is insensitive to guanine nucleotide stimulation; in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl, the taurocholate-solubilized enzyme has a sedimentation coefficient of 12.5 S and a Stokes radius of 11 nm, consistent with a molecular weight of 594,000 for the protein-detergent complex. Treatment of particulate fractions with trypsin (less than 10 micrograms/ml) markedly activates membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase activity, abolishes stimulation by guanine nucleotides, and reduces the sedimentation coefficient of the detergent-solubilized enzyme; higher concentrations of trypsin release a still smaller water-soluble enzyme complex (7.5 S, 6.1 nm Stokes radius, calculated Mr = 190,000) from the membrane. In combination with genetic evidence (Kataoka, T., Broek, D., and Wigler M., (1985) Cell 43, 493-505), our data are consistent with a structural and functional model of yeast adenylyl cyclase in which GTP-activated RAS proteins stimulate cAMP synthesis by relieving an inhibitory constraint on the activity of the CYR1 gene product. This constraint may be mediated by the amino-terminal portion of the CYR1 polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1568382722,"Endothelium provides a specific binding site for Factor IX/IXa which can propagate activation of coagulation by promoting Factor IXa-VIII-mediated activation of Factor X. In this report the endothelial cell Factor IX/IXa binding site has been identified and the coagulant function of the receptor blocked. Studies using [3H]Factor IX derivatized with the photoaffinity labeling agent N-succinimidyl-6-(4′-azido-2′-nitrophenylamino)hexanoate (SANPAH) and cultured bovine endothelial cells demonstrated cross-linking to a trypsin-sensitive cell surface protein of Mr approximately equal to 140,000. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled endothelium with Factor IX derivatized with the cleavable cross-linking agent N-succinimidyl(4-azidophenyl)-1,3′-dithiopropionate and antibody to Factor IX demonstrated the endothelial cell origin of the Mr 140,000 cell surface protein. Blockade of the Factor IX/IXa binding protein by covalently linking SANPAH-5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-Factor IXa or SANPAH-Factor IX prevented both specific Factor IXa binding and effective Factor IXa-VIII-mediated activation of Factor X on endothelium. Following extraction of endothelium with detergents, Factor IX/IXa binding activity was solubilized and could be assayed using a polyvinyl chloride plate binding assay. Western blots of cell extracts demonstrated binding of 125I-Factor IX at Mr approximately equal to 140,000 which was blocked by excess Factor IX, but not antisera to Factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, alpha 2-macroglobulin, or epidermal growth factor receptor. These data indicate that endothelium provides a distinct binding site for Factor IX/IXa consisting, at least in part, of a membrane protein which can modulate the coagulant activity of Factor IXa on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1493331137,"We have analyzed the asynchronous progression of replication forks through the early (E) and late (L) gene sides in bidirectionally replicating SV40 chromosomes during lytic infection. By cutting purified replicating DNA with an appropriate single-site restriction endonuclease and measuring the contour lengths of replicated and unreplicated segments by electron microscopy, the positions of the two replication forks in each elongating intermediate were determined. Our results indicate that there are at least two major classes of replicating SV40 chromosomes which differ in their relative rate of E and L fork movement, the presence or absence of bound SV40 large T antigen during elongation, and the termination region utilized. These two classes also have altered apparent start sites for initiating bidirectional replication, flanking either side of core ori. The largest group (67%) replicated synchronously was associated with T antigen during elongation, appeared to initiate bidirectional elongation at nucleotide 5203 or 41 base pairs (bp) toward the E side of 0/5243, at the junction of T binding site I and ori, and terminated at the typical region centered at 0.5 map units. A second group (24%) replicated asynchronously with the L fork moving 3 times faster than the E fork, was not associated with T antigen during elongation, and terminated at a broad region centered at 0.73 map units. This group appeared to initiate at nucleotide 29 at the junction of the AT-rich region of ori, T binding site I, and the start of the 21-bp repeated transcriptional control sequences. A third group (9%) appeared to initiate at nucleotide 5148 or 95 bp to the E side of 0/5243 and replicated asynchronously preferentially on the E side at early times. However, this group is related to the synchronous class in that it contains bound T antigen and both forks move synchronously past 30% elongation, terminating at the same region. The association of T antigen with synchronous but not asynchronous DNA molecules indicates that T functions in regulating fork movement during elongation. A synchronization role implies that both forks are closely associated with one another in replicating molecules with bound T. Replicating molecules lacking T not only elongated highly asynchronously but preferential fork progression occurred almost exclusively on the L side. The ori region in asynchronous compared to synchronous intermediates was differentially sensitive to BglI digestion, indicating that nuclease digestion can distinguish between different populations of replicating molecules.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1556649860,"The cyclic decapeptide, polymyxin B (PMXB), was found to inhibit hypoglycemia in mice receiving exogenous insulin (Amir, S., and Shechter, Y. (1985) Eur. J. Pharmacol. 110, 283-285). In this study, we have extended this observation to rats. Insulin-dependent hypoglycemia in rats is efficiently blocked at a 12:1 molar ratio of PMXB to insulin. This effect is highly specific, as it could not be mimicked by a variety of antibiotics or positively charged substances. Chemical modifications of PMXB have revealed that the ring structure, rather than the tail structure, is important for anti-insulin-like activity. Colistin A, which differs from PMXB by one conservative amino acid substitution in the ring structure, is devoid of this activity. Polymyxin B does not interact with insulin, nor does it alter the rate of insulin absorption and/or degradation, or the ability of insulin to bind to target tissues. This peptide inhibits hypoglycemia by blocking insulin-dependent activation of the hexose transport mechanism, as deduced by in vitro studies. The effect of insulin in stimulating hexose uptake (and subsequent glucose metabolism) in both isolated muscle tissue and adipocytes is blocked with little or no effect on the basal activities of these processes. Colistin A has no significant inhibiting effect. Other insulin-dependent activities, such as inhibition of lipolysis in adipocytes or synthesis of DNA in muscle cells, are not inhibited. It is concluded that PMXB inhibits, in a highly specific manner, the action of insulin in stimulating hexose transport and subsequent glucose metabolism, both in vitro and in the whole animal model."
https://openalex.org/W1596331358,"The uptake of [32P]phosphate by human, gel-filtered blood platelets and its incorporation into cytoplasmic ATP and polyphosphoinositides was studied. In unstimulated platelets, uptake was Na+o-dependent and saturable at approximately 20 nmol/min/10(11) cells with a half-maximal rate at 0.5 mM extracellular phosphate. Upon stimulation with thrombin or collagen, net influx of [32P]Pi was accelerated 5- to 10-fold. With thrombin, [32P]Pi efflux was also increased. After the first 2 min, efflux exceeded influx, resulting in the net release of [32P]Pi from the platelets. Since the stimulus-induced burst in [32P]Pi uptake paralleled the secretory responses, it might be an integral part of stimulus-response coupling in platelets. The stimulus-induced burst in net [32P]Pi uptake led to an enhanced labeling of metabolic ATP, which was already detectable at 5 s after stimulation with thrombin. Concomitantly, the incorporation of [32P]Pi into phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was accelerated. The thrombin-induced increase in specific 32P radioactivity of cytoplasmic ATP fully accounted for the simultaneous increase in specific 32P radioactivity of these phosphoinositides. In studying the extent of 32P labeling of phosphorylated compounds in response to a cellular stimulus, it is therefore essential to measure the effect of the stimulus on the specific radioactivity of cytoplasmic ATP."

Pausing in the oriC region occurs at the same sites where termination occurs in vivo. Ten of these sites overlap RNA:DNA junctions in oriC. The pausing that occurs in vitro was not converted to efficient termination by guanosine 5'-diphosphate 3'-diphosphate, NusA, and Rho alone or in combination, or by DnaA suggesting that in vivo other or additional factors contribute to termination at oriC. Transcription from the 16-kDa promoter was 90% inhibited by the nucleotides guanosine 5'-diphosphate 3'-diphosphate and guanosine 5'-triphosphate 3'-diphosphate in agreement with previous observations that this promoter is stringently regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1560634007,"The inactivation of rat renal brush border membrane Na+-H+ exchange by the covalent carboxylate reagent N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) was studied by measuring 1 mM Na+ influx in the presence of a pH gradient (pHi = 5.5; pHo = 7.5) and H+ influx in the presence of a Na+ or Li+ gradient ([Na+]i = 150 mM; [Na+]o = 1.5 mM). In the presence of DCCD, the rate of Na+ uptake decreased exponentially with time and transport inhibition was irreversible. At all DCCD concentrations the loss of activity was described by a single exponential, consistent with one critical DCCD-reactive residue within the Na+-H+ exchanger. Among several carbodiimides the most hydrophobic carbodiimide, DCCD, was also the most effective inhibitor of Na+-H+ exchange. With 40 nmol of DCCD/mg of protein, at 20 degrees C for 30 min, 75% of the amiloride-sensitive 1 mM Na+ uptake was inhibited. Neither the equilibrium Na+ content nor the amiloride-insensitive Na+ uptake was significantly altered by the treatment. The Na+-dependent H+ flux, measured by the change in acridine orange absorbance, was also decreased 80% by the same DCCD treatment. If 150 mM NaCl, 150 mM LiCl, or 1 mM amiloride was present during incubation of the brush border membranes with 40 nmol of DCCD/mg of protein, then Li+-dependent H+ flux was protected 50, 100, or 100%, respectively, compared to membranes treated with DCCD in the absence of Na+-H+ exchanger substrates. The combination of DCCD and an exogenous nucleophile, e.g. ethylenediamine and glycine methyl ester, increased Na+-dependent H+ flux in the presence of 80 nmol of DCCD/mg of protein, compared to the transport after DCCD treatment alone. These findings suggest that the Na+-H+ exchanger contains a single carboxylate residue in a hydrophobic region of the protein, and the carboxylate and/or a nearby endogenous nucleophilic group is critical for exchange activity."
https://openalex.org/W2440740512,"The effect of phosphate on the binuclear iron center of pink (reduced) uteroferrin was examined by magnetic resonance and optical spectroscopy. The (oxidized) protein, which contains 1 mol of tightly bound phosphate per mol of enzyme at isolation, does not give rise to a 31P NMR signal. Phosphate binding to phosphate-stripped pink uteroferrin is indistinguishable from that in the native phosphoprotein. As measured by EPR and optical spectroscopy, the rate of reaction between phosphate and pink uteroferrin is pH-dependent, decreasing as the pH increases. Phosphate is capable of binding to the reduced protein between pH 3 and 7.8, resulting in formation of the uteroferrin-phosphate complex. Evans susceptibility measurements at pH 4.9 indicate that the EPR silent species with a maximum absorption at 535 nm, generated upon phosphate addition to pink uteroferrin, is diamagnetic. Moreover, phosphate causes disappearance of the hyperfine-shifted resonances in the 1H NMR spectra of the reduced protein. We therefore have not been able to identify the paramagnetic purple reduced enzyme-phosphate complex reported by Pyrz et al. (Pyrz, J. W., Sage, J. T., Debrunner, P. G., and Que, Jr., L. (1986) J. Biol Chem. 261, 11015-11020) using Mossbauer spectroscopy and dithionite-reduced 57Fe-reconstituted uteroferrin. Our present data with native unmodified enzyme are in accord with our earlier results (Antanaitis, B. C., and Aisen, P. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 751-756) and with the results of Burman et al. (Burman, S., Davis, J. C., Weber, M. J., and Averill, B. A. (1986) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 136, 490-497) on bovine spleen phosphatase, suggesting that phosphate binding to reduced protein rapidly induces oxidation of the binuclear iron center."
https://openalex.org/W1525491969,"The mechanistic stoichiometry of charge separation coupled to the flow of electrons through cytochrome c oxidase has remained a center of controversy since it was first demonstrated that cytochrome oxidase is an H+ pump. Currently the major dispute is whether the q+/O ratio for this segment is 4 or 6. One cause of the controversy is incomplete coupling between electron flow, electrogenic H+ ejection, and electrophoretic cation uptake, which is usually attributed to finite rates of H+ leakage and/or slippage of the H+ pumps. To minimize the uncertainty which incomplete coupling introduces into estimates of the mechanistic stoichiometry, a new approach (Beavis, A. D., and Lehninger, A. L. (1986) Eur. J. Biochem. 158, 307-314) has been used to determine the upper and lower limits of the mechanistic q+/O translocation stoichiometry of cytochrome oxidase. In this approach, the relationship between the rate of valinomycin-dependent K+ uptake, JK, and rate of O2 consumption, JO, is determined as the rates are modulated by two distinct means. When the rates are modulated by the rate of electron flow (i.e. rate of energy supply) the slope of JK versus JO must at all points be less than the mechanistic K+/O ratio. On the other hand, when the rates are modulated by varying the concentration of valinomycin (i.e. the rate of energy utilization) the slope of JK versus JO must at all points be greater than the mechanistic K+/O ratio. The results indicate that the q+/O ratio lies between 4.3 and 5.5. These data are inconsistent with both currently favored stoichiometries, and it is suggested that the true mechanistic stoichiometry of charge separation coupled to electron flow through cytochrome oxidase may be 5 q+/O."
