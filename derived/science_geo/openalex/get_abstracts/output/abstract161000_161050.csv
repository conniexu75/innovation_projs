https://openalex.org/W2081097093,"Many intracellular pathogens infect a broad range of host tissues, but the importance of T cells for immunity in these sites is unclear because most of our understanding of antimicrobial T cell responses comes from analyses of lymphoid tissue. Here, we show that in response to viral or bacterial infection, antigen-specific CD8 T cells migrated to nonlymphoid tissues and were present as long-lived memory cells. Strikingly, CD8 memory T cells isolated from nonlymphoid tissues exhibited effector levels of lytic activity directly ex vivo, in contrast to their splenic counterparts. These results point to the existence of a population of extralymphoid effector memory T cells poised for immediate response to infection."
https://openalex.org/W2080739875,"Quantized vortices play a key role in superfluidity and superconductivity. We have observed the formation of highly ordered vortex lattices in a rotating Bose-condensed gas. These triangular lattices contained over 100 vortices with lifetimes of several seconds. Individual vortices persisted up to 40 seconds. The lattices could be generated over a wide range of rotation frequencies and trap geometries, shedding light on the formation process. Our observation of dislocations, irregular structure, and dynamics indicates that gaseous Bose-Einstein condensates may be a model system for the study of vortex matter."
https://openalex.org/W1499169484,"Finding a means to generate, control and use spin-polarized currents represents an important challenge for spin-based electronics, or 'spintronics'. Spin currents and the associated phenomenon of spin accumulation can be realized by driving a current from a ferromagnetic electrode into a non-magnetic metal or semiconductor. This was first demonstrated over 15 years ago in a spin injection experiment on a single crystal aluminium bar at temperatures below 77 K. Recent experiments have demonstrated successful optical detection of spin injection in semiconductors, using either optical injection by circularly polarized light or electrical injection from a magnetic semiconductor. However, it has not been possible to achieve fully electrical spin injection and detection at room temperature. Here we report room-temperature electrical injection and detection of spin currents and observe spin accumulation in an all-metal lateral mesoscopic spin valve, where ferromagnetic electrodes are used to drive a spin-polarized current into crossed copper strips. We anticipate that larger signals should be obtainable by optimizing the choice of materials and device geometry."
https://openalex.org/W2099685145,"Expanded polyglutamine repeats have been proposed to cause neuronal degeneration in Huntington's disease (HD) and related disorders, through abnormal interactions with other proteins containing short polyglutamine tracts such as the transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein, CBP. We found that CBP was depleted from its normal nuclear location and was present in polyglutamine aggregates in HD cell culture models, HD transgenic mice, and human HD postmortem brain. Expanded polyglutamine repeats specifically interfere with CBP-activated gene transcription, and overexpression of CBP rescued polyglutamine-induced neuronal toxicity. Thus, polyglutamine-mediated interference with CBP-regulated gene transcription may constitute a genetic gain of function, underlying the pathogenesis of polyglutamine disorders."

https://openalex.org/W1633910587,"We report manipulation of the atom number statistics associated with Bose-Einstein condensed atoms confined in an array of weakly linked mesoscopic traps. We used the interference of atoms released from the traps as a sensitive probe of these statistics. By controlling relative strengths of the tunneling rate between traps and atom-atom interactions within each trap, we observed trap states characterized by sub-Poissonian number fluctuations and adiabatic transitions between these number-squeezed states and coherent states of the atom field. The quantum states produced in this work may enable substantial gains in sensitivity for atom interference-based instruments as well as fundamental studies of quantum phase transitions."

https://openalex.org/W2053004995,"Protein actions are usually discussed in terms of static structures, but function requires motion. We find a strong correlation between phosphorylation-driven activation of the signaling protein NtrC and microsecond time-scale backbone dynamics. Using nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation, we characterized the motions of NtrC in three functional states: unphosphorylated (inactive), phosphorylated (active), and a partially active mutant. These dynamics are indicative of exchange between inactive and active conformations. Both states are populated in unphosphorylated NtrC, and phosphorylation shifts the equilibrium toward the active species. These results support a dynamic population shift between two preexisting conformations as the underlying mechanism of activation."

https://openalex.org/W2029469204,"The rat insular cortex (IC) subserves the memory of conditioned taste aversion (CTA), in which a taste is associated with malaise. When the conditioned taste is unfamiliar, formation of long-term CTA memory depends on muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptors, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and protein synthesis. We show that extinction of CTA memory is also dependent on protein synthesis and beta-adrenergic receptors in the IC, but independent of muscarinic receptors and MAPK. This resembles the molecular signature of the formation of long-term memory of CTA to a familiar taste. Thus, memory extinction shares molecular mechanisms with learning, but the mechanisms of learning anew differ from those of learning the new."

https://openalex.org/W2000151769,"Receptor-mediated activation of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) was visualized in living Dictyostelium discoideum cells by monitoring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between alpha- and beta- subunits fused to cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins. The G-protein heterotrimer rapidly dissociated and reassociated upon addition and removal of chemoattractant. During continuous stimulation, G-protein activation reached a dose-dependent steady-state level. Even though physiological responses subsided, the activation did not decline. Thus, adaptation occurs at another point in the signaling pathway, and occupied receptors, whether or not they are phosphorylated, catalyze the G-protein cycle. Construction of similar energy-transfer pairs of mammalian G-proteins should enable direct in situ mechanistic studies and applications such as drug screening and identifying ligands of newly found G-protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2002492838,"Incorporating nanocrystals into future electronic or optoelectronic devices will require a means of controlling charge-injection processes and an understanding of how the injected charges affect the properties of nanocrystals. We show that the optical properties of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots can be tuned by an electrochemical potential. The injection of electrons into the quantum-confined states of the nanocrystal leads to an electrochromic response, including a strong, size-tunable, midinfrared absorption corresponding to an intraband transition, a bleach of the visible interband exciton transitions, and a quench of the narrow band-edge photoluminescence."

https://openalex.org/W1965801259,"Food-web processes are important controls of oceanic biogenic carbon flux and ocean-atmosphere carbon dioxide exchange. Two key controlling parameters are the growth efficiencies of the principal trophic components and the rate of carbon remineralization. We report that bacterial growth efficiency is an inverse function of temperature. This relationship permits bacterial respiration in the euphotic zone to be computed from temperature and bacterial production. Using the temperature-growth efficiency relationship, we show that bacterial respiration generally accounts for most community respiration. This implies that a larger fraction of assimilated carbon is respired at low than at high latitudes, so a greater proportion of production can be exported in polar than in tropical regions. Because bacterial production is also a function of temperature, it should be possible to compute euphotic zone heterotrophic respiration at large scales using remotely sensed information."
https://openalex.org/W2064999318,"A formulation based on defect-generated dissolution stepwaves of the variation of dissolution rate with the degree of undersaturation is validated by near-atomic-scale observations of surfaces, Monte Carlo simulations, and experimental bulk dissolution rates. The dissolution stepwaves emanating from etch pits provide a train of steps similar to those of a spiral but with different behavior. Their role in accounting for the bulk dissolution rate of crystals provides a conceptual framework for mineral dissolution far from equilibrium. Furthermore, the law extends research to conditions closer to equilibrium and predicts a nonlinear decrease in the rate of dissolution as equilibrium is approached, which has implications for understanding artificial and natural processes involving solid-fluid reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1970235440,"Neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are thought to be transferred from post- to presynaptic neurons and to be involved in the formation and plasticity of neural circuits. However, direct evidence for a transneuronal transfer of BDNF and its relation to neuronal activity remains elusive. We simultaneously injected complementary DNAs of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged BDNF and red fluorescence protein into the nucleus of single neurons and visualized expression, localization, and transport of BDNF in living neurons. Fluorescent puncta representing BDNF moved in axons in the anterograde direction, though some moved retrogradely, and transferred to postsynaptic neurons in an activity-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1987613981,"Analysis of Global Positioning System (GPS) data demonstrates that ongoing three-dimensional crustal deformation in Fennoscandia is dominated by glacial isostatic adjustment. Our comparison of these GPS observations with numerical predictions yields an Earth model that satisfies independent geologic constraints and bounds both the average viscosity in the upper mantle (5 x 10(20) to 1 x 10(21) pascal seconds) and the elastic thickness of the lithosphere (90 to 170 kilometers). We combined GPS-derived radial motions with Fennoscandian tide gauge records to estimate a regional sea surface rise of 2.1 +/- 0.3 mm/year. Furthermore, ongoing horizontal tectonic motions greater than approximately 1 mm/year are ruled out on the basis of the GPS-derived three-dimensional crustal velocity field."
https://openalex.org/W2027543487,"Texture evolution governs many of the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of polycrystalline materials, but texture models have only been tested on the macroscopic level, which makes it hard to distinguish between approaches that are conceptually very different. Here, we present a universal method for providing data on the underlying structural dynamics at the grain and subgrain level. The method is based on diffraction with focused hard x-rays. First results relate to the tensile deformation of pure aluminum. Experimental grain rotations are inconsistent with the classical Taylor and Sachs models."
https://openalex.org/W1979835199,"We report the realization of a Bose-Einstein condensate of metastable atoms (helium in the lowest triplet state). The excitation energy of each atom with respect to the ground state is 20 electron volts, but inelastic processes that would destroy the sample are suppressed strongly enough in a spin-polarized sample to allow condensation. Our detection scheme takes advantage of the metastability to achieve detection of individual atoms as well as of the decay products of inelastic processes. This detection opens the way toward new studies in mesoscopic quantum statistical physics, as well as in atomic quantum optics."

https://openalex.org/W1909836501,"The widespread appearance of megaphyll leaves, with their branched veins and planate form, did not occur until the close of the Devonian period at about 360 Myr ago. This happened about 40 Myr after simple leafless vascular plants first colonized the land in the Late Silurian/Early Devonian, but the reason for the slow emergence of this common feature of present-day plants is presently unresolved. Here we show, in a series of quantitative analyses using fossil leaf characters and biophysical principles, that the delay was causally linked with a 90% drop in atmospheric pCO2 during the Late Palaeozoic era. In contrast to simulations for a typical Early Devonian land plant, possessing few stomata on leafless stems, those for a planate leaf with the same stomatal characteristics indicate that it would have suffered lethal overheating, because of greater interception of solar energy and low transpiration. When planate leaves first appeared in the Late Devonian and subsequently diversified in the Carboniferous period, they possessed substantially higher stomatal densities. This observation is consistent with the effects of the pCO2 on stomatal development and suggests that the evolution of planate leaves could only have occurred after an increase in stomatal density, allowing higher transpiration rates that were sufficient to maintain cool and viable leaf temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2133647910,"A novel metalloproteinase with similarity to pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), which we denoted PAPP-A2, has been identified. Through expression in mammalian cells we showed that recombinant PAPP-A2 polypeptide of 1558 residues resulted from processing of a 1791-residue prepro-protein. Unlike PAPP-A, PAPP-A2 migrated as a monomer (of 220 kDa) in non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The prepro-parts of PAPP-A2 and PAPP-A are not homologous, but mature PAPP-A2 shares 45% of its residues with PAPP-A. Because PAPP-A specifically cleaves insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-4, one of six known modulators of IGF-I and -II, we looked for a possible PAPP-A2 substrate among the members of this family. We showed that PAPP-A2 specifically cleaved IGFBP-5 at one site, between Ser-143 and Lys-144. In contrast to the cleavage of IGFBP-4 by PAPP-A that strictly requires the presence of IGF, the cleavage of IGFBP-5 by PAPP-A2 was IGF-independent. Recent data firmly establish PAPP-A and IGFBP-4 as an important functional pair in several systems. Because of its close relationship with PAPP-A, both structurally and functionally, PAPP-A2 is a likely candidate IGFBP-5 proteinase in many tissues and conditioned media where IGFBP-5 proteolysis has been reported.AF311940 A novel metalloproteinase with similarity to pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), which we denoted PAPP-A2, has been identified.

Based on their co-localization on chromosome 1 (1q24), we hypothesized the existence of a novel protein similar to PAPP-A, which we named PAPP-A2. We first established a coding cDNA sequence aligning with the ∼60% remaining, central region of PAPP-A; cDNA was synthesized using human placental mRNA as a template and a primer derived from AL031290(5′-GCTCACACACCACAGGAATG-3′). With primers derived from AL031734(5′-GGCTGATGTGCGCAAGACCTG-3′) and AL031290(5′-GCATTGTATCTTCAGGAGCTTG-3′), a PCR product was generated that corresponded to the central region, a total of 908 amino acids (PAPP-A2 residues 665–1572). Manual inspection of the genomic sequence ofAL031734 revealed that the open reading frame of the sequence stretch aligning with PAPP-A continued further in the 5′ direction; nt 102646–103566 encode a polypeptide sequence of 307 residues that starts with a methionine residue. Thus, the same cDNA preparation was used to obtain a contiguous cDNA sequence encoding the N-terminal portion of PAPP-A2 using primers from AL031734(5′-GAAGTTGACTTCTGGTTCTGTAG-3′) and from the central region (5′-CCCTGGGAAGCGAGTGAAGCC-3′). A stop codon was present in the sequence of AL031290 corresponding to PAPP-A residue 1618. Therefore, cDNA was synthesized using placental mRNA and a primer originating from AL031290 further 3′ to this stop codon (5′-GCATTTCTTATAAGATCCTTCATGC-3′). A contiguous cDNA corresponding to the C-terminal of PAPP-A2 was obtained in a PCR with primers from the central region (5′-GACAGCTGTCCGTCATTGCTGC-3′) and from AL031290(5′-CTTACTGCCTCTGAGGCAGTGG-3′). All PCRs were carried out withPfu polymerase (Stratagene). The three overlapping PAPP-A2 cDNA fragments obtained were cloned into the vector pCR-BluntII-TOPO (Invitrogen), and referred to as p2N, p2Mid, and p2C, respectively. The entire sequence of 5376 nucleotides encodes preproPAPP-A2 of 1791 residues 3The entire sequence of 5376 nucleotides encoding preproPAPP-A2 (1791 residues) is deposited in the GenBankTMdata base under accession number AF311940. . A cluster of EST sequences matching the genomic sequence ofAL031290 was identified around nt 64000–66000 of AL031290 starting ∼1.2 kb from the 3′ end of the PAPP-A2 encoding sequence.

As expected, the size of the resulting product was 2.2 kb, further demonstrating the existence of a PAPP-A2 mRNA with a 3′ untranslated region of ∼3 kb. TheNotI-BamHI fragment from p2C was cloned into pBluescriptIISK+ (Stratagene) to obtain p2CBlue. TheNotI-SpeI fragment from p2N and theSpeI-BclI fragment from p2Mid were ligated into the NotI/BclI sites of p2CBlue to obtain p2NMidCBlue containing the entire PAPP-A2 cDNA.

The mutated fragment was digested with XbaI and XhoI and swapped into pPA2 to generate pPA2-KO. Two primers (5′-GAGGGCCTGTGGACCCAGGAG-3′, nt 4906–4926 of AF311940, and 5′-GACGTAAAGCTTCTGATTTTCTTCTGCCTTGG-3′, nt 5373–5354 of AF311940, preceded by a HindIII site, AAGCTT) were used in a PCR with pPA2 as the template to generate a nucleotide fragment encoding the C-terminal 156 residues of PAPP-A2 with the stop codon replaced by a HindIII site for in-frame ligation into the vector pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(-)A. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into the EcoRI/HindIII sites of the vector to generate pPA2C-mH. The NotI-XbaI fragment and theXbaI-EcoRI fragment were excised from pPA2 and cloned into the NotI/EcoRI sites of pPA2C-mH.

Primers containing an XhoI site (5′-TCCGCTCGAGATGGTGTTGCTCACCGCGGT-3′) and a HindIII site (5′-CGATAAGCTTCTCAACGTTGCTGCTGTCG-3′) were used, and the resulting PCR product was cloned into the XhoI/HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(-)A (Invitrogen). Expression was performed as above. Cleavage analysis was carried out by Western blotting. Briefly, rIGFBP-5 as contained in cell culture medium (2 μl, ∼10 ng of rIGFBP-5) was incubated with culture supernatants from cells transfected with pPA2 or pPA2-KO (10 μl, ∼2 ng of rPAPP-A2) or with the same amount of culture supernatant from cells transfected with empty vector. Phosphate-buffered solution and inhibitors as specified in the main text were added to a final volume of 25 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 12 h, 10 μl of the reaction mixture was separated by reducing 16% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a PVDF membrane, and intact rIGFBP-5 and the C-terminal cleavage product of rIGFBP-5 were detected with monoclonal anti-c-myc (clone 9E10, ATTC) using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (P260, DAKO), and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SDS-PAGE was performed in Tris/glycine gels (10–20% or 16%). A metal chelate affinity column (1 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was charged with nickel ions and used for affinity purification of His-tagged proteins in serum-free medium. Bound protein was eluted with 10 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered solution containing 500 mm NaCl and further dialyzed against 20 mmHEPES, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. For cleavage site determination, affinity-purified rIGFBP-5 (20 μg) was digested (37 °C for 12 h) with purified rPAPP-A2 (∼1 μg) immobilized via anti-c-myc to recombinant protein G-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.). Edman degradation was performed as described earlier (16Sottrup-Jensen L. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 187-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The amount of purified protein was determined by amino acid analysis (17Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 30: 789-794PubMed Google Scholar). Estimation of the amount of rPAPP-A2 and rIGFBP-5 when non-purified was done by comparing the responses in Western blotting (using anti-c-myc) with the responses of known molar amounts of purified rIGFBP-5. To ensure the complete absence of IGF-I or -II in the preparation of rIGFBP-5, affinity-purified material (100 μg) was further loaded onto a Superdex 75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated, and eluted with 50% formic acid at 0.5 ml/min. At the acidity of the solvent (pH < 1), any possible bound IGF would dissociate from rIGFBP-5 and elute separately (18Hintz R.L. Liu F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1977; 45: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 19Mohan S. Baylink D.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 637-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, IGFBP-5-containing fractions were loaded directly onto a reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) column (4 × 250 mm Nucleosil C4 500-7, Macherey-Nagel). A linear gradient was formed from 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and 0.075% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 90% (v/v) acetonitrile (solvent B), increasing the amount of solvent B by 2.3%/min. The column was equilibrated with 5% solvent B, operated at 50 °C and with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and the separation was monitored at 226 nm. Bound IGFBP-5 eluted at ∼42% solvent B. The HPLC step alone was not sufficient as IGF-II (Bachem) eluted close to IGFBP-5 on this column as seen in separate runs. The pure protein was lyophilized, redissolved in solvent A, and further diluted three times in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. This material was prepared for experiments to demonstrate that cleavage of IGFBP-5 by PAPP-A2 (using ∼0.1 μg purified PAPP-A2/2 μg IGFBP-5) occurs in the absence of IGF and is not promoted by IGF. We have identified and cloned a novel cDNA sequence encoding a protein of 1791 residues with homology to PAPP-A as detailed under “Experimental Procedures”. We name this protein preproPAPP-A23. Alignment of preproPAPP-A2 with preproPAPP-A (Fig. 1) demonstrates its similarity to mature PAPP-A; there is no homology between the prepro-peptides. In this alignment, 46% of the residues of mature PAPP-A are also present in PAPP-A2. Like PAPP-A, the amino acid sequence of PAPP-A2 contains three lin-notch motifs (LNR1–3) and five short consensus repeats (SCR1–5) (Fig. 1). All 82 cysteine residues of mature PAPP-A are also found in PAPP-A2, but PAPP-A2 has four additional cysteines not present in PAPP-A. In addition, the zinc binding site and a putative Met-turn are conserved between the two proteins (Fig. 1), classifying PAPP-A and PAPP-A2 as metzincins (20Stocker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the residue immediately following the third histidine of the zinc binding consensus (Val-744 in PAPP-A2) and one residue close to the methionine (Asn-805 in PAPP-A2) are conserved within each of the four recognized metzincin superfamily members: the astacins, the reprolysins, the serralysins, and the matrix metalloproteinases (20Stocker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). However, PAPP-A and PAPP-A2 do not fit in this pattern, they do not show homology to any members of the four families, and further, the linear distance between the third histidine and the methionine is much longer in PAPP-A and PAPP-A2. PAPP-A and PAPP-A2 are therefore reasonably classified as members of a new, fifth metzincin family, which we tentatively designate the pappalysins. To obtain recombinant PAPP-A2 (rPAPP-A2), 293T cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding c-myc tagged PAPP-A2 (pPA2-mH). Western blotting of the culture medium showed a single band of ∼220 kDa (Fig. 2,lane 2), absent in medium from mock transfected cells (Fig.2, lane 1). Reduction of disulfide bonds did not cause a visible change in band migration (Fig. 2, lane 4). Thus, in contrast to PAPP-A, PAPP-A2 is not a disulfide bound dimer. Edman degradation, performed on purified rPAPP-A2 (Fig. 2, lane 5) blotted onto a PVDF membrane, revealed the N-terminal sequence of the secreted rPAPP-A2 to be 234SPPEESNQ, corresponding to cleavage after the four residues RVKK233(Fig. 1). This supports the prediction that PAPP-A2 is synthesized as a prepro-protein. The absence of an arginine residue in the P1 position indicates that the proprotein processing enzyme responsible for this cleavage is not furin but likely a different proprotein convertase (21Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Because the two motifs responsible for the metalloproteolytic activity of PAPP-A are conserved in PAPP-A2, we hypothesized that PAPP-A2 is a proteolytic enzyme, and because IGFBP-4 is the only known PAPP-A substrate, we looked for a PAPP-A2 substrate among the six known IGFBPs (Fig. 3). IGFBP-1, -2, -4, and -6 were not cleaved; IGFBP-3 showed limited degradation. However, complete proteolysis of IGFBP-5 is evident from this experiment. To further analyze the cleavage of IGFBP-5 by PAPP-A2, IGFBP-5 was expressed in mammalian cells. Wild-type rPAPP-A2 (Fig.4, lane 3), but not a variant mutated in the zinc binding site (E734Q) (Fig. 4, lane 2), efficiently degraded rIGFBP-5. As expected, 1,10-phenanthroline and EDTA but not 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin abolished wild-type rPAPP-A2 activity (Fig. 4, lanes 4–6). Of interest, in contrast to the proteolysis of IGFBP-4 by PAPP-A (1Lawrence J.B. Oxvig C. Overgaard M.T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gleich G.J. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Conover C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3149-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), cleavage of IGFBP-5 by PAPP-A2 did not require the addition of IGF-I or -II. To verify that cleavage was not induced by traces of IGF bound to IGFBP-5, we further purified this by acidic gel filtration and (RP-HPLC). At low pH, any bound IGF would dissociate from IGFBP-5 (18Hintz R.L. Liu F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1977; 45: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 19Mohan S. Baylink D.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 637-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and elute separately according to their different molecular weights. Using this material, cleavage of IGFBP-5 by purified PAPP-A2 was still observed without added IGF (Fig. 5,lane 2). Interestingly, added IGF-II did not have any apparent effect on the rate of cleavage as seen with shorter incubation resulting in incomplete digestion (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and4).Figure 5Cleavage of highly purified rIGFBP-5 in the absence of added IGF. Possible traces of bound IGF were removed from affinity-purified rIGFBP-5 by gel filtration at pH < 1 and further by RP-HPLC. Pure protein (2 μg) was incubated (20 h) in the absence (lane 1) and in the presence (lane 2) of purified rPAPP-A2 (0.1 μg). This conclusively shows that the cleavage of IGFBP-5 by PAPP-A2 does not depend on the presence of IGF. Further, shorter incubation (1 μg, 1 h) in the absence (lane 3) and presence (lane 4) of IGF-II (500 nm) revealed that IGF-II did not enhance the proteolysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For cleavage site determination, purified rIGFBP-5 (Fig.6, lane 1) was digested with purified PAPP-A2 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6, lane 2). Edman degradation of blotted material showed that bothdistinct, visible degradation products (Fig. 6, lane 2) contained the N-terminal sequence144KFVGGA 4IGFBP-5 is numbered with the N-terminal Leu of the mature protein as residue 1. . Both of the two distinct bands represent intact C-terminal cleavage fragments because they also contain the C-terminal c-myc tag (Fig. 6, lane 3); they are likely to be differently glycosylated in accordance with the heterogeneity of purified rIGFBP-5 (Fig. 6, lane 1). Both bands contained a second sequence at lower level (45%), 1LGXFVH, corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of IGFBP-5. The absence of Ser, expected in the third cycle of Edman degradation, was taken as evidence for carbohydrate substitution of Ser-3. O-linked glycan on the N-terminal cleavage fragment is likely to cause it to smear around the two distinct, C-terminal fragments. Sequence analysis directly on the reaction mixture (>100 pmol) without SDS-PAGE separation showed only the same two IGFBP-5 sequences in equimolar amounts. Thus, PAPP-A2 cleaves IGFBP-5 at one site between Ser-143 and Lys-144. Probing a blot with mRNA from several human tissues, previously used for PAPP-A (12Overgaard M.T. Oxvig C. Christiansen M. Lawrence J.B. Conover C.A. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Haaning J. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), resulted in a signal from the human placenta only (not shown). However, using the blast algorithm (13Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar), a total of 98 human EST sequences were identified that matched the 3′ untranslated region of the PAPP-A2 mRNA sequence. Of these, 39% originated from placenta, 21% from pregnant uterus, 11% from fetal liver/spleen, and 5% from kidney. Several other tissues were represented but with fewer EST sequences. Hence, like PAPP-A (12Overgaard M.T. Oxvig C. Christiansen M. Lawrence J.B. Conover C.A. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Haaning J. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), PAPP-A2 expression is neither limited to the placenta nor to pregnancy. Proteolytic activity against IGFBP-5 has been widely reported from several sources, e.g. pregnancy serum (22Claussen M. Zapf J. Braulke T.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3527-3533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and fibroblasts (28Busby, W. H., Jr., Nam, T. J., Moralez, A., Smith, C., Jennings, M., and Clemmons, D. R. (2000) J. Biol.

Matrix metalloproteinase-2 and the serine proteinase complement C1s have been reported to contribute to the IGFBP-5 proteolytic activity in media from osteoblasts (27Thrailkill K.M. Quarles L.D. Nagase H. Suzuki K. Serra D.M. Fowlkes J.L. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3527-3533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and fibroblasts (28Busby, W. H., Jr., Nam, T. J., Moralez, A., Smith, C., Jennings, M., and Clemmons, D. R. (2000) J. Biol. Chem..Google Scholar), respectively. However, in general, the proteinase responsible for cleavage of IGFBP-5 has remained unidentified. The recent identification of PAPP-A as the IGFBP-4 proteinase in fibroblasts (1Lawrence J.B.

No other substrate has been found for PAPP-A, and no other proteinase has been shown to cleave IGFBP-4 physiologically. It is therefore very tempting to speculate that the pair of PAPP-A2 and IGFBP-5 plays an analogous role in a number of the tissues mentioned above. Interestingly, incubating IGFBP-5 with smooth muscle cells-conditioned medium resulted in cleavage between Ser-143 and Lys-144 (24Imai Y. Busby Jr., W.H. Smith C.E. Clarke J.B. Garmong A.J. Horwitz G.D. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2596-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the same cleavage site as found here with purified PAPP-A2. This immediately identifies PAPP-A2 as an obvious candidate IGFBP-5 proteinase for this tissue. After completion of the experimental work presented here, data base searching revealed that additional genomic sequences (AC027620 andAL139282) and a partial cDNA sequence (AJ278348) had appeared. From none of these, however, can the complete cDNA sequence of PAPP-A2 be deduced. In conclusion, we have identified, cloned, and expressed a novel protein with homology to PAPP-A, and we have demonstrated the putative proteolytic activity of this protein. We named the protein PAPP-A2 to signify its close relationship with PAPP-A both structurally and functionally. With PAPP-A, PAPP-A2 defines a new, fifth family of the metzincin superfamily of metalloproteinases, the pappalysins. Further, we have identified a natural substrate for PAPP-A2, IGFBP-5, analyzed its cleavage, and indicated several tissues where PAPP-A2 may be of physiological relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2038334622,"The Milky Way galaxy contains a large, spherical component which is believed to harbor a substantial amount of unseen matter. Recent observations indirectly suggest that as much as half of this “dark matter” may be in the form of old, very cool white dwarfs, the remnants of an ancient population of stars as old as the galaxy itself. We conducted a survey to find faint, cool white dwarfs with large space velocities, indicative of their membership in the galaxy's spherical halo component. The survey reveals a substantial, directly observed population of old white dwarfs, too faint to be seen in previous surveys. This newly discovered population accounts for at least 2 percent of the halo dark matter. It provides a natural explanation for the indirect observations, and represents a direct detection of galactic halo dark matter."

https://openalex.org/W1496786655,"Brown dwarfs are not massive enough to sustain thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at their centres, but are distinguished from gas-giant planets by their ability to burn deuterium. Brown dwarfs older than approximately 10 Myr are expected to possess short-lived magnetic fields and to emit radio and X-rays only very weakly from their coronae. An X-ray flare was recently detected on the brown dwarf LP944-20, whereas previous searches for optical activity (and one X-ray search) yielded negative results. Here we report the discovery of quiescent and flaring radio emission from LP944-20, with luminosities several orders of magnitude larger than predicted by the empirical relation between the X-ray and radio luminosities that has been found for many types of stars. Interpreting the radio data within the context of synchrotron emission, we show that LP944-20 has an unusually weak magnetic field in comparison to active M-dwarf stars, which might explain the previous null optical and X-ray results, as well as the strength of the radio emissions compared to those at X-ray wavelengths."
https://openalex.org/W2090409893,"We report stationary, nonequilibrium potential and adsorbate patterns with an intrinsic wavelength that were observed in an electrochemical system with a specific type of current/electrode-potential (I-phi(DL)) characteristic. The patterns emerge owing to the interplay of a self-enhancing step in the reaction dynamics and a long-range inhibition by migration currents rather than by diffusion. Theoretical analysis revealed that this self-structuring of the electrode occurs in all electrochemical systems with an S-shaped I-phi(DL) characteristic in wide and well-accessible parameter ranges. This unusual pattern-forming instability in electrochemical systems has all the characteristics of the mechanism proposed by Turing in 1952 in the framework of an early theory of morphogenesis. Our finding might account for structure formation in certain biological systems that have gradients in the electric potential and may open new paths for fabricating patterned electrodes."

SQN encodes the Arabidopsis homolog of cyclophilin 40 (CyP40), a protein found in association with the Hsp90 chaperone complex in yeast, mammals, and plants.

Folate transport in mammalian cells is mediated by a number of different processes. The reduced folate carrier (RFC1)1 is a facilitative anion exchanger that mediates folate delivery into a variety of cells of different origin (7Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26, Suppl. 16.: 11-23Google Scholar, 8Sirotnak F.M. Tolner B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 91-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). RFC1 has a much higher affinity for reduced folates, including the physiological substrate 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (∼2 μm), than folic acid (∼200 μm) (9Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Folate receptors (α and β), which anchor to cell membranes through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety, transport folates via an endocytotic process (10Kamen B.A. Wang M.-T. Streckfuss A.J.

However, receptor-α null animals could be sustained through day 18 of gestation by oral intubation with administration of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, but live birth of these animals was not reported (18Piedrahita J.A. Oetama B. Bennett G.D. van Waes J. Kamen B.A. Richardson J. Lacey S.W. Anderson R.G. Finnell R.H. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Loss of folate receptor-β was not associated with a pathological phenotype (18Piedrahita J.A. Oetama B. Bennett G.D. van Waes J. Kamen B.A. Richardson J. Lacey S.W. Anderson R.G. Finnell R.H. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In this paper, we examine the consequences of the targeted disruption of the other major folate transporter, RFC1, in particular, the defects that occur during embryonic development and in the early neonatal period. This carrier is of particular importance, since (i) RFC1 is a very efficient transporter; the cycling rate of RFC1 is 2 orders of magnitude faster than that of folate receptor-α (19Spinella M.J. Brigle K.E. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7842-7849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). (ii) The tissue distribution pattern of RFC1 in normal tissues is different, in part, from that of folate receptor-α. RFC1 is expressed in placenta, liver, lung, and small intestine (20Prasad P.D. Ramamoorthy S. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 21Chiao J.H. Roy K. Tolner B. Yang C.H. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11165-11170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whereas folate receptor-α has been detected in choroid plexus, lung, thyroid, kidney, breast, placenta, ovary, and testis (22Weitman S.D. Lark R.H. Coney L.R. Fort D.W. Frasca V. Zurawski Jr., V.R. Kamen B.A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3396-3401PubMed Google Scholar, 23Weitman S.D. Weinberg A.G. Coney L.R. Zurawski Jr., V.R. Jennings D.S. Kamen B.A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6708-6711PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) RFC1 and folate receptor-α may localize to different regions in polarized cells, i.e. apical versus basolateral membranes, as demonstrated in mammalian retinal pigment epithelium (24Chancy C.D. Kekuda R. Huang W. Prasad P.D. Kuhnel J.M. Sirotnak F.M. Roon P. Ganapathy V. Smith S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20676-20684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Hence, these spatial relationships may play a role in the vectorial transport of folates. The results of the current study shed further light on the critical role that RFC1 plays in embryonic development and in meeting folate demands in hematopoietic tissues. A mouse genomic Charon 35, 129/ola phage library was screened with aPstI/NarI fragment (662 base pairs) of exon 4 (25Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Three positive clones were identified; one contained the exons 3–6 (25Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). HindIII fragments of this clone were subcloned into plasmid Bluescript (Strategene). The targeting construct was generated by a two-step insertion of HindIII fragments into plasmid PKGNeo. A 1.3-kb fragment containing only a small part of exon 3 was treated with Klenow polymerase and cloned into an EcoRI site, whereas a 7-kb fragment containing exons 4–6 was inserted into a HindIII site of PKGNeo. The targeting vector was linearized at the single XhoI site and electroporated into 2.0 × 107 WW 6 embryonic stem cells (26Ioffe E. Liu Y. Bhaumik M. Poirier F. Factor S.M. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7357-7361Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Neomycin (150 μg/ml)-resistant clones were screened by PCR using a forward primer (p1) specific for the upstream RFC1 gene, 5′-CAGGACAGAATCGTGAGACAGAAC-3′; a reverse primer (p2) specific for the downstream RFC1 gene, 5′-CTGCTCCTTGGTGAATTTAC-3′; and a reverse primer (p3) specific for the neomycin cassette in PKGNeo, 5′-CCCAGAAAGCGAAGGAACAAAG-3′. Positive clones were identified by a 1.6-kb PCR fragment specific for the disrupted RFC1 and a 1.3-kb fragment specific for the wild-type RFC1 gene. Two positive clones, RFC1–99 and RFC1–113, were identified from a total of 395 clones. The correct targeting event was also shown by SacI digestion of high molecular weight DNA and Southern blot analysis using thePstI/NarI fragment directed at exon 4 ofRFC1. Chimeric mice were generated by injecting C57BI/6 blastocysts with 8–12 embryonic stem cells derived from RFC1–99 and RFC1–113 clones. RFC1–99 gave rise to a male chimeric animal, while RFC1–113 produced a female chimera. Both mice transmitted the RFC1 mutation through the germ line. Heterozygous mice were maintained, and mating was initiated to generate homozygous mutants. Primary embryonic fibroblasts were established from 15.5-day fetuses and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium using a standard protocol (27Edelmann W. Cohen P.E. Kane M. Lau K. Morrow B. Bennett S. Umar A. Kunkel T. Cattoretti G. Chaganti R. Pollard J.W. Kolodner R.D. Kucherlapati R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1125-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The fibroblast cells were trypsinized, washed twice with cold PBS, and sonicated in cold PBS supplemented with a proteinase inhibitor mixture (P8340, Sigma, 10% (v/v)). Total lysates (10 μg) were treated with dithiothreitol-free loading buffer at room temperature and resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Subsequent blotting and detection were performed according to the ECL Plus Western blotting detection systems (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with an RFC1 antibody directed to the C terminus of the carrier (28Zhao R. Gao F. Liu L. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1466: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). MTX was used as a model transport substrate for RFC1 (29Goldman I.D. Lichtenstein N.S. Oliverio V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5007-5017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MTX influx was assayed in fibroblasts growing on, and adherent to, the bottom of 20-ml glass scintillation vials with 0.5 μm [3H]MTX as described previously (30Sharif K.A. Goldman I.D. BioTechniques. 2000; 28 (, 930, 932): 926-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Folate supplementation was administrated by subcutaneous injections ofRFC1 +/− dams. Initially, folate supplementation was begun 1 week before matings; later, supplementation (most of the animals that received a folic acid dose of 1 mg/day) was started at the time of appearance of the vaginal plug. The latter supplementation schedule appeared to improve the mating efficiency. Folate supplementation continued until pregnant dams were sacrificed orRFC1-null pups died or were sacrificed. Folic acid and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate were dissolved in water at appropriate concentrations, neutralized to pH 7.0, sterile-filtered, and injected with a 26-gauge needle in a volume of 0.1 ml. The neonatal mice were sacrificed before death, and their organs were examined and then immersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for fixation. Sections from all organs were cut at 4–5 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). The E18.5 embryos were fixed, then serial coronal sections of the entire embryos were processed and embedded to obtain HE-stained cross-sections. Serial sectioning of the paraffin-embedded blocks of tissues from neonates and sectioning of embryos were undertaken, as warranted, to ensure complete evaluation of representative sections of all organs. A targeted disruption of an RFC1 allele was generated in embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination. A large part of exon 3, which harbors the initiation codon ATG, was replaced with a neomycin cassette as illustrated in Fig. 1 a. Heterozygous progeny of chimeric animals were identified by genomic PCR and Southern blot analysis of SacI-digested tail DNA (Fig.1, b and c, respectively). Two breeding colonies derived from two independently targeted embryonic stem cell clones were studied and gave the same results. Mice heterozygous for RFC1 were mated to generate F2 offspring. From these matings 284 pups from 37 litters were obtained and genotyped. One-hundred and eighty-four pups were heterozygous forRFC1, and 100 were wild-type (TableI). No homozygous RFC1-null pups were identified, indicating that the mutation was embryonic lethal. RFC1 +/− mice were physically indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates.Table IGenotyping of pups born from matings between RFC1+/− miceFolate supplementation (subcutaneous)Total pupsLittersAverage litter sizeRFC1+/+RFC1+/−RFC1−/−%Folate substrate (μg/day)None0284377.7100 (35)184 (65)0Folic acid101326.52 (15)11 (89)025723.55 (71)2 (29)01001635.39 (56)7 (44)025018292 (11)16 (89)05002245.56 (27)16 (73)01000194395.060 (31)116 (60)18 (9.3)5-Formyltetrahydrofolate10003966.510 (26)28 (76)0 Open table in a new tab Studies were conducted to determine at which stage embryos ceased to develop. At day 11.5 no RFC1 −/−embryos were identified from a total number of 49 (TableII). However, embryonic tissues could be isolated from two small implants and were homozygous forRFC1 disruption. At day 9.5, 11 smaller and markedly deformed nonviable RFC1 −/− embryos were identified among 95 fetuses; examples are illustrated in Fig.2. Additionally, there were 10 (10%) completely reabsorbed implants (Table II). Hence, theRFC1 -null embryos died before day 9.5.Table IIGenotyping of embryos from matings between RFC1+/− miceEmbryonic stageNo. littersNo. implantsNo. resorbedNo. embryosEmbryonic genotypeRFC1+/+RFC1+/−RFC1−/−%%No supplementation with folic acidE11.56536 (11)2-aSome tissues could be isolated from two partially reabsorbed embryos and were genotyped and found to be homozygous for RFC1 disruption.4916 (32)31 (63)0E9.51410510 (10)9530 (31)54 (57)11 (12)Supplementation with folic acid at a dose of 1 mg/dayE15.53200204 (20)11 (55)5 (25)E18.575405418 (33)24 (44)11 (20)2-a Some tissues could be isolated from two partially reabsorbed embryos and were genotyped and found to be homozygous for RFC1 disruption. Open table in a new tab In an attempt to circumvent the folate transport defect in RFC1-null embryos, RFC1 +/−dams were injected subcutaneously with folic acid at doses of 10, 25, 100, 250, 500, or 1000 μg/day beginning 1 week before conception and continuing during gestation and for 2 weeks after the pups were born. Folic acid is a very poor substrate for RFC1 (8Sirotnak F.M. Tolner B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 91-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 9Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and at the blood levels generated with the high doses utilized, it is likely that appreciable quantities of folic acid may be delivered into cells by passive diffusion as well as other secondary transport routes (14Henderson G.B. Strauss B.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1709-1714PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1505-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,17Yang C.-H. Dembo M. Sirotnak F.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 75: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). There were no live births ofRFC1 −/− pups until a dose of 1 mg of folic acid/day was administrated to RFC1 +/−dams. Eighteen (9.3%) RFC1 −/−mice were obtained from 194 live births in 39 litters (Table I). NoRFC1 −/− neonates were identified when RFC1 +/− dams were injected with 1 mg/day 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, a reduced folate with a high affinity for RFC1, but a much lower affinity for folate receptors than folic acid (9Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 12Wang X. Shen F. Freisheim J.H. Gentry L.E. Ratnam M. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). RFC1−/− mice born fromRFC1 +/− dams supplemented with folic acid, aside from being pale, appeared normal during the first few days of life but then showed growth retardation and increasing weakness dying at or before day 12. Four RFC1 −/−mice were euthanized for pathological studies at postpartum days 9, 10, 11, and 12, along with four RFC1 +/− and fourRFC1 +/+ littermates. The body weights of theseRFC1 −/− animals (3.1 ± 0.2 g) were significantly lower (paired t test,p < 0.0025) than the weight of theRFC1 +/+ (6.9 ± 0.4 g) orRFC1 +/− (6.7 ± 0.4 g) neonates (Fig.3 a). There were no significant pathologic differences between wild-type and heterozygous mice. However, the spleen and thymus of RFC1-null mice were extremely small, and these organs and the liver were very pale (Fig.3 b). Histologic examination indicated a marked absence of hematopoiesis in the bone marrow (Fig. 3, c versus d) ofRFC1 −/− mice, and extramedullary hematopoiesis was also absent in spleen (Fig. 3, e versus f) and liver. The lymphocyte population in the white pulp of the spleen (Fig. 3, e versus f) and in the cortex of the thymus was markedly diminished (Fig. 3, g versus h) in theRFC1 −/− mice. Postnatal development of renal medullary tubules and the seminiferous tubules in the testis was also impaired. There were no abnormalities in other organs, including stomach, small intestine, proximal and distal colon, cecum, heart, lungs, uterus, urinary bladder, eye, brain, pancreas, or salivary gland. E18.5 embryos were examined histologically to determine the extent to which development was sustained prior to birth by folic acid supplementation of dams at a dose of 1 mg/day of folic acid. The percentage of RFC1-null fetuses (20%) was close to the predicted 25% for the homozygous genotype (Table II). Histologic examination on RFC1-null (n = 6), heterozygous (n = 4), and wild-type (n= 4) embryos indicated almost complete protection from adverse effects of RFC1 inactivation by folic acid supplementation. Erythropoeisis was active in liver (Fig.4, a versus b) and bone marrow (Fig. 4, c versus d), with comparable numbers of nucleated red cells as compared with wild-type and heterozygous littermates. Splenic erythropoiesis was mildly to markedly impaired in only two of the sixRFC1 −/− embryos (Fig. 4,e versus f). The thymus (Fig. 4,g versus h) and kidneys inRFC1-null embryos were not different fromRFC1 +/− and RFC1 +/+embryos. Three independent embryonic fibroblast cell lines were established for each genotype from three 15.5-day fetuses from dams that received folic acid supplementation to confirm that RFC1 had been completely inactivated in mice (Table II). An antibody against the C terminus of RFC1 detected a 58-kDa protein in wild-type fibroblast cells, the same size as found in murine leukemia L1210 cells (Fig.1 d) (28Zhao R. Gao F. Liu L. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1466: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The level of expression of RFC1 in heterozygous fibroblasts was decreased as compared with that of wild-type cells. No RFC1 protein was detected in RFC1-null fibroblasts. As indicted in Fig. 1 e, MTX influx was decreased by 28 and 82% in RFC1 ± andRFC1 −/− fibroblasts, respectively, as compared with wild-type cells. The small residual transport activity in RFC1-null cells was apparently due to alternative folate transport route(s) in the fibroblasts. Rapidly proliferating tissues require an adequate supply of folate substrate to meet cellular demands for one-carbon moieties for a variety of cellular biosynthetic processes. RFC1 is a well characterized folate transporter with a high affinity for the physiological folate substrate 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and has been the subject of intensive studies because of its critical role in antifolate transport and resistance (7Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26, Suppl. 16.: 11-23Google Scholar, 8Sirotnak F.M. Tolner B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 91-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). However, it was unclear as to its role in the delivery of folates to a diverse spectrum of tissues due to the presence of multiple folate transport routes in mammalian cells. To address the role of the RFC1 gene in mouse embryonic development and neonatal life, the gene was disrupted by homologous recombination. The complete absence of carrier in RFC1−/− mice was verified by the lack of RFC1 protein and a marked decrease in MTX influx in embryonic fibroblast cells. RFC1−/− embryos died before E9.5. Embryos lacking folate receptor-α die at a similar development stage (18Piedrahita J.A. Oetama B. Bennett G.D. van Waes J. Kamen B.A. Richardson J. Lacey S.W. Anderson R.G. Finnell R.H. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Thus, RFC1 and folate receptor-α simultaneously play distinct roles in embryonic folate homeostasis, and the presence of one does not compensate for the loss of the other. This is likely related to their different tissue expression patterns (20Prasad P.D. Ramamoorthy S. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 21Chiao J.H. Roy K. Tolner B. Yang C.H. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol.

Roon P. Ganapathy V. Smith S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20676-20684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the critical requirement for folates in normal embryogenesis (31Hernandez-Diaz S. Werler M.M. Walker A.M. Mitchell A.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 1608-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In both cases high doses of folate administered to dams rescued embryos. However, the amounts of folate used were 3 orders of magnitude higher than that recommended for pregnant women (0.4 mg/day) to prevent neural tube abnormalities (2Czeizel A.E. Dudas I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 1832-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (2695) Google Scholar, 3Daly L.E. Kirke P.N. Molloy A. Weir D.G. Scott J.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1995; 274: 1698-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). It is of interest that folic acid, but not 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, prolonged the life of RFC1-null mice up to 12 days postpartum, while the latter extended the viability of folate receptor-α-null embryos to day 18. At the high blood levels of folic acid generated in these animals, ∼100 μm, adequate folate delivery could have been achieved via a transport route that has a higher affinity for folic acid than 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (17Yang C.-H. Dembo M. Sirotnak F.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 75: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Also, because 5-formyltetrahydrofolate is a racemic mixture, and the disomer does not have biologic activity, it could compete with thel isomer and inhibit its utilization. Hence, transport is not fully stereospecific (32White J.C. Bailey B.D. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 242-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and limited data suggest mammalian folylpolyglutamate synthetase can utilize both 6R and 6S diastereomers of folates (33Moran R.G. Baldwin S.W. Taylor E.C. Shih C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21047-21051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Chen L. Qi H. Korenberg J. Garrow T.A. Choi Y.J. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13077-13087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). While folic acid supplementation can maintain near-normal embryonic development up to at least E18.5 in RFC1−/−embryos and some animals go on to live birth, the life of animals beyond postpartum day 12 cannot be sustained. Prior to birth, high folate concentrations achieved by folic acid injection, with transport or diffusion across the placenta barrier where high levels of folate receptor are expressed (23Weitman S.D. Weinberg A.G. Coney L.R. Zurawski Jr., V.R. Jennings D.S. Kamen B.A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6708-6711PubMed Google Scholar), provides adequate folates for the developing embryo. However, possibly due to low concentrations of folic acid in the mother's milk and inactivation of intestinal RFC1 that is involved in folate absorption across the pup's small intestine (21Chiao J.H. Roy K. Tolner B. Yang C.H. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11165-11170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,35Kumar C.K. Nguyen T.T. Gonzales F.B. Said H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C289-C294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where folate receptors are not expressed (36Said H.M. Ma T.Y. Ortiz A. Tapia A. Valerio C.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C729-C736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there is apparently insufficient folate available to sustain the life of pups long after birth. The major pathological changes occurred in tissues of hematopoietic origin in RFC1-null neonatal mice, suggesting that cells of other origins can receive adequate folate via transport route(s) other than RFC1. The lack of any pathological changes in intestine of neonatal animals, which normally express high levels of RFC1, raises the possibility that this carrier may not be the only folate transporter in this tissue although folate receptor is not expressed in intestine. It is possible that the small intestine of the neonatal mouse can absorb sufficient folate to support proliferation and maturation of crypt cells while not delivering enough folate to support the growth of peripheral tissues. While folate deficiency in humans is associated with megaloblastic anemia (1Wickramasinghe S.N. Semin. Hematol. 1999; 36: 3-18PubMed Google Scholar), cardiovascular disease (4Boushey C.J.

Nutr. 2000; 130: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), aplasia anemia was observed in RFC1-null mice, a phenomenon that is unexplained but may be related to the severity of the folate deficiency (37Branda R.F. Anthony B.K. Jacob H.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1270-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is of interest that RFC1+/− mice manifest no apparent pathological changes, although the level of RFC1 protein in RFC+/− embryonic fibroblasts was decreased as compared with that of wild-type cells, and transport was reduced by ∼30%. Hence, a mild decease in RFC1 activity is well tolerated at least in mice on the usual folate-rich diet. It is therefore likely that mutations or polymorphisms in RFC1 that markedly impair function in the homozygous state would not have physiological consequences when only one allele is affected and the wild-type allele is expressed. Recently, a polymorphism (G80A) in RFC1 has been identified, but its role in folate transport or folate homeostasis remains to be established (38Chango A. Emery-Fillon N. de Courcy G.P. Lambert D. Pfister M. Rosenblatt D.S. Nicolas J.P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 70: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We are grateful to Solomon Babani for his excellent technical support."

Taken together, our reports suggest that AR interacts with TFIIH and P-TEFb and enhances the elongation stage of transcription.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). To initiate transcription, general transcription factors need to be recruited to the promoter either in a stepwise fashion or in a form of holoenzyme (1Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The promoter clearance is defined as a point when RNA polymerase II leaves the initiation complex to start elongation of transcripts (2Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 77: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the COOH-terminal domain (CTD)1 of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II is required to establish and maintain the elongation complex (3Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 3346-3350Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 4Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A. Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 375-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Activators have been demonstrated to stimulate one or more steps of the transcription cycle by direct or indirect communication with the general transcription factors (1Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 5Beato M. Sanchez-Pacheco A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 587-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In addition, activators may also interact with auxiliary factors, called coregulators, to enhance recruitment of the general transcription machinery on the promoter (6Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar,7Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Direct interactions of activators with coregulators and/or general transcription factors have been suggested to be mechanisms for transcriptional activation (5Beato M. Sanchez-Pacheco A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 587-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 6Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 7Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Nuclear run-on transcription and RNase protection analyses revealed three classes of activation domains (8Blau J. Xia H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bently D. Mol. Cll. Biol. 1996; 16: 2044-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Type 1 activators, such as Sp1 and CTF, stimulate an initiation stage of transcription. Type 2A activators, such as Tat encoded by human immunodeficiency virus type 1, stimulate an elongation stage, thus type 2A activators may prevent abortive elongation by arrest of RNA polymerase II at poorly defined sites. Type 2B activators, such as VP16 and p53, stimulate both an initiation and an elongation stage. The AR is a member of the steroid receptor superfamily that is composed of a variable amino-terminal domain, a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, and a ligand-binding domain (9Chang C. Kokontis J. Liao S.T. Science. 1988; 240: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Ligand-dependent transcriptional activation of steroid receptors is mediated by the COOH-terminal domain that includes a ligand-binding domain and activation function-2 (10Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies show that ligand-bound steroid receptors undergo a conformational change in the activation function-2 core motif (11Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar, 12Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The ligand-induced conformational change presumably recruits coregulators as well as the basal transcriptional machinery for the target gene expression (6Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 7Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The coregulators of nuclear receptors (ARA24, ARA54, ARA55, ARA70, ARA160, CBP/p300, p/CIP/ACTR/AIB1, Rb, RIP140, SRC-1/NCoA-1, TIF-2/GRIP1, and TRAPs/DRIPs) have recently been cloned and characterized (6Robyr D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20229-20234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that coregulators function as a bridge between activators and the basal transcription machinery (5Beato M. Sanchez-Pacheco A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 587-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 6Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 7Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). They may potentiate transactivation of nuclear receptors in transient transfection or in in vitrotranscription assays through the modification of nucleosomal structure or the efficient recruitment of basal transcription machinery (6Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 7Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). A growing number of coregulators, such as SRC-1, ACTR, and PCAF, of steroid receptors have been reported to possess and/or recruit histone acetyltransferase activity to induce modification of nucleosomal structures leading to activation of transcription (6Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In contrast to coactivators, corepressors, such as NCoR-1 and SMRT, bind to the nuclear receptors in the absence of ligands, recruit histone deacetyltransferase, and lead to condensation of nucleosomal structures for repression of transcription (6Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 18Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 319-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain of steroid receptors contains a ligand-independent activation function-1, which is under the control of activation function-2 (10Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain of steroid receptors has been reported to interact with general transcription factors, as exemplified by AR interaction with transcription factor IIF (TFIIF) (19McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8485-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) (20Lee D.K. Duan H.O. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Transcription factor IIB has been reported to interact with thyroid receptor (21Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Wu S. Koudinova N. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4507-4515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), vitamin D receptor (22Blanco J. Wang I. Tsai S. Tsai M. O'Malley B. Jurutka P. Haussler M. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1535-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (23Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1824-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which activation function-1 synergistically activates transcription remains unclear. We reported previously that the AR interacted with TFIIH under physiological conditions and that overexpression of Cdk-activating kinase, the kinase moiety of TFIIH, enhanced AR-mediated transactivation in prostate cancer cells (20Lee D.K. Duan H.O. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In an effort to further dissect the mechanisms implicated in AR transactivation, we found that AR interacts with PITALRE, a kinase subunit of positive elongation factor b (P-TEFb) (24Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12335-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), and that cotransfection of the plasmid encoding the mutant PITALRE (mtPITALRE), which is defective in its CTD kinase activity (25Mancebo H.S.Y. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D. Price D. Flores O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2633-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), results in preferential inhibition of AR-mediated transactivation. AR transactivation is also preferentially inhibited at the low concentration of DRB, a CTD kinase inhibitor. In addition, a nuclear run-on transcription assay of the PSA gene, an androgen-inducible gene, using LNCaP nuclei showed that the transcription efficiency of the distal region of the gene was enhanced upon androgen induction. These results suggest that AR interacts with TFIIH and P-TEFb and enhances the elongation stage of transcription. The complementary DNA fragments for PITALRE and mtPITALRE were generous gifts (25Mancebo H.S.Y. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D. Price D. Flores O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2633-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene). The complementary DNA fragment for negative elongation factor-D (NELF-D) (26Yamaguchi Y. Takgi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) was generated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pSG5. DU145 and PC-3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 7% FBS, respectively. Non-prostate cancer H1299 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. All media contain 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded to be a density of 50–60% confluence for transfection. Cells in 35-mm dishes were refed with fresh medium 2 h before transfection and transfected with 2 μg of DNA according to the “SuperFect transfection” instructions (Qiagen). After 2–3-h incubation, cells were treated with medium supplemented with charcoal-dextran-treated FBS containing either ethanol or ligands. Cells were further incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, washed with PBS, and harvested. Cell lysates were prepared and used for luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Relative luciferase activities were plotted using the activity of AR in the absence of ligand and coactivator as 1. The results were obtained from at least three sets of transfection and presented as mean ± S.D. LNCaP whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (27Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar) and aliquots stored at −70 °C. For immunoprecipitation, protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) resins were incubated with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) overnight, washed with PBS, and coupled to anti-human PITALRE polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) as follows. Swollen protein A-Sepharose (100 μl) was incubated with 50 μl of anti-PITALRE antibody (Santa Cruz). The conjugated resins (30 μl bed volume) were incubated with 1 mg of whole cell extract for 4 h at 4 °C, then extensively washed with 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0) and 100 mm KCl. The resins were incubated with 0.2 m glycine HCl (pH 2.5) to elute proteins. The resins were extensively washed with 20 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 8.0) and were incubated with 0.2 methanolamine (pH 11.5) to elute proteins. The eluted proteins were combined and analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blotting was performed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A recombinant protein, 6 histidine-tagged AR amino-terminal and DNA-binding domain (AR-NDBD), amino acids from 38 to 643, was expressed in Escherichia coli. Bacterial cells were lysed in 5 ml of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol). Recombinant proteins were purified using Ni2+ resin (Novagen) affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purity of the proteins was over 90%, judged by Commassie Blue staining of the gel. Proteins obtained from 50 ml of culture were incubated with 100 μl bed volume of Ni2+ resins. The resins were incubated with35S-labeled TNT-expressed PITALRE for 4 h and washed extensively with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5 mmEDTA, 20% glycerol, and 400 mm NaCl. The bound proteins were eluted by 2× SDS loading buffer (100 mm Tris·HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 200 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Nuclear run-on transcription assay was performed as described elsewhere (28Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith,J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1987) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology,Vol. 1, p. 4.10, Wiley Interscience, Cambridge, MAGoogle Scholar). Briefly, LNCaP cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells at ∼60–70% confluence were treated with medium supplemented with charcoal-dextran-treated FBS containing either ethanol or 1 nm DHT. Cells were further incubated at 37 °C for 16 h, washed with PBS, and harvested. Cells were resuspended in 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and incubated on ice for 10 min. The nuclei pellets were spun down at 500 ×g and resuspended in 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 40% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Nuclei were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen in portions of 100 μl corresponding to 2 × 107nuclei. The nuclei were mixed with 100 μl of 10 mmTris·HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 0.5 mm each ATP, GTP, UTP, and 100 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. RNase free DNase I was added, and the incubation was continued for 10 min at 37 °C. Protease K was added to a final concentration of 300 μg/ml in 0.1% SDS, and the reaction mixture was incubated 30 min at 37 °C. The labeled RNA transcripts were isolated by phenol extraction, phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Nuclear transcripts were separated from unincorporated nucleotides using Sephadex G-50 columns equilibrated with 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.8), 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.3% SDS. The DNA fragments containing the PSA exons 1 and 2 were obtained by polymerase chain reaction of the plasmid containing the genomic PSA. The DNA fragments were gel-purified and digested with EcoRI. The distal and proximal PSA DNA fragments (Fig. 6 A) were gel-purified. The plasmid-containing 7SK gene (29Murphy S. Yoon J.-B. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3247-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) was digested withPstI. Each DNA fragment was denatured and immobilized onto the nylon membrane using a slot blot (Schleicher & Schuell) as described elsewhere (28Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith,J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1987) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology,Vol. 1, p. 4.10, Wiley Interscience, Cambridge, MAGoogle Scholar). The membrane was prehybridized for 2 h at 60 °C in 6× SSC, 10× Denhardt's reagent, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was carried out at 60 °C for 24 h in 6× SSC, 1.0% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 1 × 106 cpm of labeled RNA transcripts. The filters were washed twice in 2× SSC for 30 min at 60 °C and then treated in 2× SSC containing RNase A (5 μg/ml) for 20 min at 30 °C to remove unhybridized regions of RNA. The filters were washed twice in 2× SSC for 10 min at 37 °C. Signals were detected using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Biochemical studies of protein-protein interactions between AR and the general transcription factors indicated that AR may interact with TFIIH and TFIIF under physiological conditions (19McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8485-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 20Lee D.K. Duan H.O. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recruitment of TFIIH completes the assembly of the preinitiation complex on the promoter and results in promoter opening and/or the early elongation/promoter clearance steps (1Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 3Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 3346-3350Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The kinase activity in TFIIH has been reported to phosphorylate the CTD of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (3Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 3346-3350Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and to stimulate the elongation stage of transcription by several activators (8Blau J. Xia H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bently D. Mol. Cll. Biol. 1996; 16: 2044-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). TFIIH-mediated CTD phosphorylation could lead to promoter clearance by dissociation of proteins recruited for the initiation steps of the preinitiation complex assembly, resulting in establishing an elongation-competent transcription complex (30Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The significance of CTD phosphorylation for the elongation stage of transcription was demonstrated by Yankulov et al. (31Yankulov K.Y. Panders M. McCraken S. Bouchard D. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3291-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The elongation stage of transcription in Xenopus oocytes was inhibited by microinjection of antibodies against TFIIH subunits, but not by microinjection of antibodies against TFIIB, a general transcription factor specific for transcription initiation. In summary, phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA polymerase II may be associated with the transition from the initiation to the elongation stage of transcription (30Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Based on intensive molecular and biochemical studies of transcription mechanisms, interaction of AR with TFIIH reported in our previous study led us to analyze whether AR enhances transcription mainly at the elongation stage of transcription. Given the fact that general elongation factors, such as P-TEFb, transcription factor IIS, and Elongins, also regulate the elongation stage of transcription (4Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A. Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 375-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effects of positive and negative elongation factors on AR-mediated transcription. P-TEFb is composed of 124- and 43-kDa polypeptides and a key regulator controlling RNA polymerase II in the elongation stage of transcription (24Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12335-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The small subunit of P-TEFb, PITALRE, possesses protein kinase activity capable of phosphorylating the CTD of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, which has been known to be a key step required to enter an elongation mode from the preinitiation complex formation on the promoter (4Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A. Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 375-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that the Tat protein encoded by the human type 1 immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) genome, a notable transcriptional modulator, which activates the elongation stage of transcription, requires P-TEFb kinase activity for the efficient transactivation both in vivo and in vitro (25Mancebo H.S.Y. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D. Price D. Flores O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2633-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 32Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramaathan Y. Mashall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Since P-TEFb is an abundant general elongation factor, cotransfection of the PITALRE wild type expression plasmid showed little, if any, effect on transcription of the reporter gene (data not shown). Thus, we used mtPITALRE, defective in its kinase activity (25Mancebo H.S.Y. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D. Price D. Flores O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2633-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), to analyze the effect of P-TEFb on AR-mediated transcription. It is necessary to compare the inhibitory effect of mtPITALRE on transcription with the promoter containing AR-responsible elements to the effect on transcription with the other promoters. We took advantage of a dual luciferase assay (Promega) using pMMTV-luciferase as a reporter gene and pRLSV40-luciferase as an internal control. Cells were cotransfected with pMMTV-luciferase, pRLSV40-luciferase, the AR expression plasmid, and variable amounts of the mtPITALRE expression plasmid. Overexpression of mtPITALRE inhibited AR-mediated transcription from the MMTV-reporter DNA ∼10-fold (lane 6 versus lane 9 in Fig. 1) and SV40 enhancer-mediated transcription from the pRLSV40-luciferase less than 3-fold (lane 10 versus lane 13 in Fig.1) in both prostate cancer PC-3 and DU145 cells. These results indicate that mtPITALRE preferentially inhibited AR-mediated transcription over SV40 enhancer-mediated transcription. However, when we used non-prostate cancer H1299 (Fig.2) and HeLa cells (data not shown), cotransfection of the mtPITALRE expression plasmid inhibited AR-mediated transcription and SV40 enhancer-mediated transcription to the same degree, resulting in little preferential inhibition of AR-mediated transcription by mtPITALRE. These results suggest that there might be another factor(s), which modulates activity of P-TEFb in prostate cancer PC-3 and DU145 cells and enhances AR-mediated transcription more efficiently. Since our preliminary data indicate that AR activates androgen-responsive genes mainly at the elongation stage of transcription, we propose that the specific factor(s) modulating activity of PITALRE may play a role in prostate cancer progression. To analyze whether AR utilizes a specific set of general elongation factors for regulation of AR transactivation, a cotransfection assay of the expression plasmid encoding NELF-D, a subunit of a recently identified negative elongation factor (26Yamaguchi Y. Takgi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), was performed. Cotransfection of the NELF expression plasmid inhibited both AR-mediated transcription and SV40 enhancer-mediated transcription to about the same degree in PC-3 (Fig. 3) and DU145 (data not shown) cells, resulting in no preferential inhibition of AR transactivation by NELF. Since cotransfection of the NELF expression plasmid did not show preferential inhibition of AR-mediated transcription in prostate cancer cells, we expect that AR does not utilize NELF to regulate AR transactivation and that the specific factor(s) modulating activity of PITALRE may not interact with NELF.Figure 3No preferential inhibition of AR-mediated transactivation by the negative elongation factor NELF in PC-3 cells. PC-3 cells were transiently transfected with 600 ng of pMMTV-luciferase, 10 ng of pRLSV40-luciferase, 30 ng of AR expression plasmid, and without or with increasing amounts of NELF expression plasmids as indicated.

The whole cell extract of AR-positive LNCaP prostate cancer cells was prepared and used for a coimmunoprecipitation assay with protein A-Sepharose beads coupled with anti-PITALRE antibody. The immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by a Western blot assay using anti-hAR antibody (NH27). As shown in Fig.4 A, AR was detected in the immunoprecipitated samples obtained using protein A-Sepharose beads coupled with anti-PITALRE antibody, but not in the samples obtained using protein A-Sepharose beads alone, indicating AR interaction with PITALRE in a ligand-independent manner under physiological conditions. This interaction was also analyzed using AR-negative prostate cancer PC-3 cells with cotransfection of plasmids encoding AR and PITALRE (Fig. 4 B). AR interaction with P-TEFb in a ligand-independent manner was further confirmed by a biochemical binding assay (Fig. 4 C). Since glutathioneS-transferase fused with the AR NH2-terminal plus DNA-binding domain (AR-NDBD) gave low purity due to protein degradation, histidine-tagged AR-NDBD was used. Consistent with the results of coimmunoprecipitation assay, 35S-labeled PITALRE was retained by the resins containing histidine-tagged AR-NDBD, but not by the resins containing E. coli proteins prepared by the same method used for the histidine-tagged AR-NDBD. The purine nucleotide analog, DRB, has been known to preferentially reduce the synthesis of promoter-distal transcripts and has a minimal effect on the synthesis of promoter-proximal transcripts both in vitro and in vivo, thus it is an inhibitor for the elongation stage of transcription by RNA polymerase II (33Zandomeni R. Weinmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14804-14811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Fraser N.W. Sehgal P.B. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2571-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The mechanism of DRB inhibition at the transcriptional elongation stage was well characterized by the finding that DRB is an inhibitor for CTD kinases (35Tamm I. Kikuchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5750-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). P-TEFb has been reported to possess a DRB-sensitive CTD kinase activity. A cotransfection assay was performed in the presence of various concentrations of DRB to analyze the significance of AR modulation during transcriptional elongation. As shown in Fig. 5, transcription from both the reporter pMMTV-luciferase and the control pRL-luciferase was slightly enhanced at the concentration of DRB lower than 10−6m, presumably due to the inhibition of nonspecific random initiation of RNA polymerase II resulting in an increase in specific initiation. However, AR-mediated transcription was markedly inhibited from 4 × 10−6m DRB, while SV40 enhancer-mediated transcription was not inhibited. These results indicate that efficient AR-mediated transcription is highly dependent on the CTD phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, which is a key step required to enter the elongation stage (3Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 3346-3350Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Together with cotransfection results obtained with the mtPITALRE, preferential inhibition of AR-mediated transcription by DRB indicates that AR may enhance androgen responsible genes mainly at the elongation stage of transcription by communicating with P-TEFb and TFIIH. Since the specific sequences of certain genes play a role in pausing or premature termination of RNA polymerase II (36Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), a nuclear run-on transcription assay of PSA gene, an androgen-inducible gene, was performed to exclude a possibility that preferential inhibition of AR-mediated transcription, either by mtPITALRE or DRB in a reporter gene assay, was due to the structure of the reporter gene. Radioactively labeled RNAs were prepared using LNCaP nuclei and hybridized with the single-stranded 7SK gene probe as a control, the proximal probe of PSA gene containing an exon 1 and the distal probe containing an exon 2 (Fig. 6 A). Although eukaryotic RNA polymerase II pausing or arrest signals are poorly characterized, RNA polymerase II pausing or arrest are frequently caused within a few hundred nucleotides from the initiation. The exons 1 and 2 of the PSA gene are separated by 1200 nucleotides, thus the exon 1 and 2 were chosen as a proximal and distal probe, respectively. As shown in Fig.6 B, the ratio of the signal detected by the distal probe to that detected by the proximal probe increased ∼2–3-fold upon androgen induction. This result clearly indicates that preferential inhibition of AR-mediated transcription was due to bona fidecharacteristics of AR-mediated transcription. AR is required to communicate with the general transcription machinery on the core promoter to exert its function as a transcriptional modulator. AR interaction with TFIIH and P-TEFb reported in our previous (20Lee D.K. Duan H.O. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and current studies indicates that AR may utilize TFIIH and P-TEFb to regulate the general transcription machinery on the core promoter. The functional significance of protein-protein interaction between AR and P-TEFb was analyzed using a transient transfection assay. Cotransfection of the expression plasmid encoding mtPITALRE, defective in its kinase activity (25Mancebo H.S.Y. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D. Price D. Flores O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2633-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), showed preferential inhibition of AR-mediated transcription in prostate cancer PC-3 and DU145 cells, when we compared the effect of mtPITALRE on AR-mediated transcription with that on SV40 enhancer-mediated transcription. SV40 enhancer-mediated transcription is a good control for analyzing the effect of mtPITALRE on AR-mediated transcription, because SV40 enhancer-mediated transcription is stimulated by several activators, such as AP-2, PU.1, Sp-1, and TEF-1 (37Kelly J.J. Wilderman A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6799-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, preferential inhibition of AR-mediated transcription by mtPITALRE was not observed when we used non-prostate cancer cells. These results suggest that specific factor(s) may interact with P-TEFb in prostate cancer cells and that cotransfection of the plasmid encoding mtPITALRE may squelch out the specific factor(s) that may regulate AR-mediated transcription by modulating the activity of P-TEFb. In addition, this preferential inhibition of AR-mediated transcription was not observed with cotransfection of the expression plasmid encoding NELF, a recently identified negative elongation factor (26Yamaguchi Y. Takgi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). These results indicate that AR utilizes a specific set of elongation factors for efficient AR-mediated transcription. The working model for AR-mediated transcription based on our results is shown in Fig.7. Both TFIIH and P-TEFb possess subunits that can phosphorylate the CTD domain of RNA polymerase II (3Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 3346-3350Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 4Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A. Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 375-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, TFIIH and P-TEFb function at different stages of transcription. TFIIH is required for promoter clearance, which is defined as a point when RNA polymerase II leaves the initiation complex to start formation of transcripts (30Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), while P-TEFb is required to prevent arrest of RNA polymerase II within a few hundred nucleotides of the promoter (4Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A. Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 375-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). P-TEFb has been reported to be required for the efficient transcription of many, but not all, genes, which explains inhibition of both SV40 enhancer-mediated transcription and AR-mediated transcription. However, AR-mediated transcription appears to suffer more severely from the frequent arrest of RNA polymerase II than SV40 enhancer-mediated transcription. This difference may reflect the possibility that the preinitiation complexes on the pRLSV40 promoter for SV40 enhancer-mediated transcription differ from those on the pMMTV promoter for AR-mediated transcription. Development of a well defined transcription system may be necessary to characterize the mechanisms by which AR enhances transcription. Since AR interacts with both TFIIH and P-TEFb, it is plausible to speculate that AR activates transcription mainly at the elongation stage. Given the fact that PITALRE is a DRB-sensitive CTD kinase (4Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A. Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 375-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), the effect of DRB on AR-mediated transcription was analyzed to demonstrate that CTD phosphorylation is a rate-limiting step for efficient AR transactivation. DRB dramatically increases the frequency of RNA polymerase II arrest within a few hundred nucleotides from the transcription initiation site by inhibiting phosphorylation of the CTD (32Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramaathan Y. Mashall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 33Zandomeni R. Weinmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14804-14811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SV40 enhancer-mediated transcription was not inhibited in the presence of 10−6m DRB, while AR-mediated transcription was severely inhibited. Transcriptional activators, such as AP-2, PU.1, Sp1, and TEF-1, modulate SV40 enhancer-mediated transcription (37Kelly J.J. Wilderman A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6799-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), thus phosphorylation of the CTD by P-TEFb may not be a rate-limiting step for efficient transcription by these activators. This result is consistent with the observation that most transcriptional activators enhance the rate of transcriptional initiation (8Blau J. Xia H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bently D. Mol. Cll. Biol. 1996; 16: 2044-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). SV40 enhancer-mediated transcription was inhibited only at the high concentration (5 × 10−5m) of DRB (data not shown). This result indicates that AR-mediated transcription requires efficient CTD phosphorylation. Consistent with the results obtained by a reporter gene assay using mtPITALRE and DRB, a nuclear run-on transcription assay of the PSA gene, an androgen-inducible gene, using LNCaP nuclei indicated that transcription efficiency of the distal region of the PSA gene was enhanced upon androgen induction (Fig. 6). This result clearly suggests that preferential inhibition of AR-mediated transcription by mtPITALRE or DRB was not due to the artifact of a reporter gene assay (e.g. RNA polymerase II pausing or arrest signal in a reporter gene). The preinitiation transcription complex activated by AR may require a high level of CTD phosphorylation for efficient transcription. All together, AR may increase the processivity of RNA polymerase II upon androgen induction. A reporter gene assay with a reporter gene containing only the multicopy of AR-responsible elements did not give detectable induction by androgens (data not shown). This phenomenon may result from the possibility that AR enhances transcriptional elongation. AR may need other activators to enhance transcriptional initiation. A recent study of androgen regulation of the p21 gene indicated that binding sites for AR and Sp1 on the p21 promoter showed synergistic activation (38Lu S. Jenster G. Epner D.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Given the fact that Sp1 enhances the rate of transcriptional initiation (8Blau J. Xia H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bently D. Mol. Cll. Biol. 1996; 16: 2044-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), this study suggests a cooperation between an activator for elongation and an activator for initiation for efficient transcription of p21 gene. Characterization of mechanisms implicated in AR transactivation may facilitate identification of additional coregulators required for efficient AR transactivation as well as development of potential therapeutic drugs for effective prevention of prostate cancer."

BACE is expressed as a precursor protein containing Pre, Pro, protease, transmembrane, and cytosolic domains. A soluble BACE derivative (PreProBACE460) that is truncated between the protease and transmembrane domains was produced by baculovirus-mediated expression. ProBACE460 was purified from conditioned media of infected insect cells using immobilized concanavalin A and immobilized BACE inhibitor, P10-P4′ Stat(Val). Furin cleaves ProBACE460 between the Pro and protease regions to generate mature BACE460. Thekcat/Km of ProBACE460 when assayed with a polypeptide substrate is only 2.3-fold less than that of BACE460. This finding and the similar inhibitory potency of P10-P4′ Stat(Val) for ProBACE460 and BACE460 suggest that the Pro domain has little effect on the BACE active site. Exposure of ProBACE460 to guanidine denaturation/renaturation results in a 7-fold higher recovery of BACE activity than when BACE460 is similarly treated. The presence of free BACE Pro peptide during renaturation of BACE460 but not ProBACE460 increases recovery of activity. These findings show that the Pro domain in ProBACE460 does not suppress activity as in a strict zymogen but does appear to facilitate proper folding of an active protease domain. β-Secretase (BACE) is a membrane-bound aspartyl protease that cleaves the amyloid precursor protein to generate the N terminus of the amyloid β peptide.

The cDNA encoding BACE predicts a precursor protein with a modular structure containing Pre, Pro, protease, transmembrane, and cytosolic tail domains (see Fig.1). Pro domains are commonly found in protease precursors where they have been shown to virtually abolish catalytic activity (7Khan A.R. James M.N.G.

Edman degradation of purified human brain BACE revealed a single N-terminal protein sequence that began at the protease domain (3Sinha S. Anderson J.P. Barbour R. Basi G.S. Caccavello R. Davis D.

BACE isolated from human embryonic kidney 293T cells that were transfected with the full-length BACE cDNA exhibited an N-terminal sequence that began mostly at the protease domain, whereas only ∼10% began at the Pro sequence (3Sinha S. Anderson J.P. Barbour R. Basi G.S. Caccavello R. Davis D. Doan M. Dovey H.F. Frigon N. Hong J. Jacobson-Croak K. Jewett N. Keim P. Knops J. Lieberburg I. Power M. Tan H. Tatsuno G. Tung J. Schenk D.

In addition, N-terminal sequencing of full-length Asp2 (i.e.BACE), which was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, also revealed proteolytic processing at the junction between the putative Pro and protease domains (4Yan R. Bienkowski M.J. Shuck M.E. Miao H. Tory M.C. Pauley A.M. Brashler J.R. Stratman N.C. Mathews W.R. Buhl A.E. Carter D.B. Tomasselli A.G. Parodi L.A. Heinrikson R.L. Gurney M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). These results establish that processing of membrane-anchored BACE after Arg-45 to release the Pro segment and generate mature BACE is prevalent in mammalian cells. In the present study, we expressed in insect cells a soluble form of the BACE precursor that is truncated at the junction between the putative protease and transmembrane regions (PreProBACE460). A BACE-related species, ProBACE460, that displays an N-terminal sequence that corresponds exactly to mammalian cell-derived ProBACE was purified from the conditioned medium (CM). The studies described herein show that the Pro domain of ProBACE460, rather than abolishing catalytic activity as in the case of true zymogens, appears to facilitate the proper folding of the BACE protease domain. The BACE cDNA was cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification of human brain mRNA (CLONTECH; Palo Alto, CA) using oligonucleotides that were designed from the published BACE cDNA sequence (2Vassar R.

In particular, the 5′-oligonucleotide (5′-CGGGATGCGGCCGCATGGCCCAAGCCCTGCCCTGGCTCCTGCTG-3′) contained aNotI site upstream of the ATG start codon and the 3′-oligonucleotide (5′-GGATCGGTCGACTTAAATTTGAGGTGACCAAGA-3′) spanned the SalI site located in the 3′-untranslated region (262 base pairs downstream from the TGA stop codon). The 1771 base pair polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into pLHCX (CLONTECH) to create the BACE retrovirus expression construct, pRBR133. The integrity of the BACE cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Midland Reagent Company, Midland TX). The cDNA encoding truncated PreProBACE (amino acids 1–460) was polymerase chain reaction amplified from pRBR133 using a 5′-oligonucleotide containing a BamHI site upstream of the ATG start codon, 5′-GCTAGAGGATCCATGGCCCAAGCCCTGCCCTGGCTCCTGCTGTGG-3′ and a 3′-oligonucleotide containing a stop codon after the Tyr460 residue followed by an XhoI site, 5′-GTCGCACTCGAGTCAATAGGCTATGGTCATGAGGGTTGACTC-3′. The 1389-base pair fragment was subcloned into the BamHI andXhoI sites of a baculovirus expression vector, pBacPAC8 (CLONTECH), to generate pRBR136. The integrity of the BACE cDNA clone was again confirmed by DNA sequencing (Midland Reagent Company). pRBR136 was transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) insect cells along with BacPAK6 viral DNA to generate recombinant virus (BACE460 virus stock) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant virus was harvested 5 days post-transfection, plaque-purified and titered as described in theCLONTECH manual. Sf21 cells (30 liters) were grown in Grace's insect medium, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1× penicillin/streptomycin to ∼9.0 × 105 cells/ml and were infected with BACE460 virus stock at a multiplicity of infection of 4 (Cell and Molecular Technologies, Inc., Lavallette NJ). After 72 h, the CM was harvested by filtration and immediately stored at 4 °C. A peptide corresponding to the Pro segment of BACE (TQHGIRLPLRSGLGGAPLGLRLPR-C) was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used as antigen for production of rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Covance Inc., Denver PA). Another peptide (RDLRKGVYVPC) that is situated within the protease domain of BACE (amino acids 122–131) was similarly used as an antigen for production of rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Covance Inc.). The anti-Pro antibody was purified by passing the serum over an affinity column containing the immobilized hapten. CM from Sf21 cells infected by BACE460 virus stock (or control virus stock), purified ProBACE460, or purified BACE460 were incubated with acetyl-TTRPGSGLTNIK(6-(7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetyl)aminohexanoyl)TEEISEVNLDAEFRHDSGK(6-(biotinamido)hexanoyl)-amide (L-405,492), a modified 31-residue polypeptide that is designed from the amino acid sequence of APP in the immediate vicinity of the β-secretase cleavage site (the residues that flank the scissile bond are underlined). L-405,492 contains the mutations NL in the P2 and P1 positions, respectively, that are observed in the Swedish-type familial Alzheimer's disease kindreds (9Mullan M. Crawford F. Axelman K. Houlden H. Lilius L. Winblad B. Lannfelt L. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). An alternative substrate, L-405,525, that was used to assay purified BACE460 and ProBACE460 is identical to L-405,492 except that it has KM at the P2 and P1 positions, respectively, which are the residues that are present in the wild type APP sequence. All assays were performed in the presence of 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 4.5, 0.2% 3-[(3cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Where indicated, BACE assays were also performed in the presence of the BACE inhibitor (3Sinha S. Anderson J.P. Barbour R. Basi G.S. Caccavello R. Davis D. Doan M. Dovey H.F. Frigon N. Hong J.

Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h unless otherwise indicated and terminated by heating the samples at 75 °C for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using a Zorbax Extend C18 column (Waters, Milford, MA). Coumarin-tagged product and substrate were monitored by fluorescence detection with excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 440 nm, respectively. The CM from BACE460 virus stock-infected Sf21 cells was spiked with NaCl (350 mm), aprotinin (0.5 μm), and leupeptin (1 μm) and applied to a concanavalin A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway NJ) column (1.5 liters of bed volume). The lectin affinity column was washed with Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.5 mNaCl) plus 0.5 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin and eluted with Buffer A plus 0.3 mα-d-glucopyranoside, 0.3 mmethyl-α-d-mannopyranoside, 0.5 μmaprotinin, and 1 μm leupeptin. EDTA (1 mm) was added to the eluate from the lectin affinity column. Diafiltration with a hollow fiber 10,000 molecular weight cut-off column (A/G Technologies, Needham MA) was used to concentrate the lectin affinity column eluate ∼15-fold and buffer exchange into 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5 μmaprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm EDTA. The diafiltration retentate was applied to an affinity column (HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing immobilized P10-P4′ Stat(Val) (3Sinha S. Anderson J.P. Barbour R. Basi G.S. Caccavello R. Davis D. Doan M. Dovey H.F. Frigon N. Hong J. Jacobson-Croak K. Jewett N. Keim P. Knops J. Lieberburg I. Power M. Tan H. Tatsuno G. Tung J. Schenk D. Seubert P. Suomensaari S.M. Wang S. Walker D. Zhao J. McConlogue L. John V. Nature. 1999; 402: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). The affinity column was washed sequentially with (a) Buffer B (20 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.0, 125 mm NaCl) plus 0.5 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm pepstatin, (b) Buffer B, (c) Buffer C (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and 750 mm NaCl), and (d) Buffer B. The P10-P4′ Stat(Val) affinity column was eluted with Buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 125 mm NaCl). Fractions were collected and evaluated for BACE activity with L-405,492. Peak activity fractions were pooled and stored as aliquots at −70 °C. ProBACE460 or BACE460 (500 nm) were incubated with furin (20 units/ml; Affinity Bioreagents Inc, Golden, CO) at 30 °C in 0.1 m Hepes, 2.5 mmCaCl2, and 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.5. At increasing times, aliquots were removed and furin activity was quenched with EDTA (5 mm). The production of BACE460 by furin treatment of ProBACE460 was assessed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using antibodies against the Pro or protease regions of BACE. Signals from the immunoblots were quantified by scanning analysis using a densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In addition, the level of BACE activity after furin treatment was evaluated with L-405,492. For the isolation of preparative amounts of BACE460, ProBACE460 (2 μm) was incubated with furin (100 units/ml) in 0.1m Hepes, pH 7.6, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100 (final volume, 6.5 ml) for 14 h at 30 °C. The sample was dialyzed versus 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 125 mm NaCl. In vitro generated BACE460 was purified by affinity chromatography with immobilized P10-P4′ Stat(Val) as described above (except that pepstatin was eliminated from the column wash step). CM (100 μl) from the BACE460 virus stock-infected Sf21 cells was spiked with control antibody (normal rabbit IgG; 0.3 μm) or anti-Pro antibody (0.3 μm; affinity purified) and immobilized protein G (10 μl of a 75% slurry) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After overnight storage at 4 °C with mixing, the samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant fractions were evaluated by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting (probing with either anti-Pro antibody or anti-protease antibody) and assayed for BACE activity using L-405,492. Immunoprecipitation of the purified ProBACE460 and BACE460 preparations (0.5 μm) was performed similarly except that 2.7 μm control and anti-Pro antibody were used. The pellet fractions were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline and assayed for BACE activity using L-405,492. ProBACE460 and BACE460 (7 mg/ml) were denatured for 1 h at 23 °C with 6 m guanidine HCl in Buffer D in the absence or presence of 50 μm BACE Pro peptide, NH2-TQHGIRLPLRSGLGGAPLGLRLPR-COOH (Synpep Inc., Dublin CA). The samples were renatured by rapid addition of Buffer D (60 volumes) to yield a final concentration of 0.1 m guanidine HCl and set at room temperature for 2 h. Control ProBACE460 and BACE460 samples to determine maximal BACE activity were adjusted to 7 mg/ml in an equivalent volume of Buffer D and treated similarly. Samples were assayed for BACE activity using L-405,492. Aliquots of the mock-denatured/renatured or denatured/renatured ProBACE460 and BACE460 samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using the anti-protease antibody. In addition, aliquots of ProBACE460 with and without treatment by guanidine denaturation/renaturation were loaded onto a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using an AKTAexplorer chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The gel filtration column was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 125 mm NaCl, and 0.1 m guanidine HCl. The amino acid compositions of protein/peptide samples were determined with a Beckman 6300 analyzer after hydrolysis of the samples using 6 n HCl containing 0.2% phenol in sealed evacuated vials at 110 °C for 20 h. N-terminal sequence analysis of purified protein samples was performed by Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems PROCISE Model 494 protein sequencer. Verification of product identity by liquid chromatography/mass spectometry analysis was performed with an Agilent Technology 1090 liquid chromatograph coupled to a PE Sciex API-3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. A truncated BACE precursor (encompassing amino acids 1–460) that contains the Pre, Pro, and protease domains (PreProBACE460) was produced in Sf21 cells using a baculovirus expression construct (Fig.1). This expression system was designed to direct the secretion of a soluble nonmembrane tethered form of BACE from the cells. SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis of CM from cells that were infected with BACE460 virus stock revealed the presence of a protein (molecular mass, ∼55,000) that reacted with anti-BACE antibodies raised against the Pro domain (Fig.2 A, lane 2) or protease domain (data not shown). In contrast, no immunoreactivity was evident with CM from Sf21 cells infected with control virus stock when probed similarly using anti-BACE antibodiesversus the Pro domain (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) or protease domain (data not shown). Treatment of CM from BACE460 virus stock-infected Sf21 cells with the antibody versus the Pro region of ProBACE in the presence of immobilized protein G fully depleted the BACE-related species that cross-reacts with the anti-Pro antibody (Fig. 2,lanes 3 and 4). Nevertheless, the ProBACE460-immunodepleted CM still possessed a less abundant species that reacts with the anti-protease antibody and migrates in the vicinity of ProBACE460 (which is indistinguishable from the mobility of BACE460, see below) (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and6). These observations indicate that most but not all of the BACE-related protein in the CM contains the Pro region. BACE activity in the CM was measured using L-405,492, the modified 31-mer polypeptide derivative designed from the APP sequence (Swedish-type familial Alzheimer's disease variant) in the vicinity of the β-secretase scissile bond. The CM from Sf21 cells infected with BACE460 virus stock catalyzed the cleavage of L-405,492 (Fig.2 B). A linear dependence of product formation on the volume of CM was observed. In contrast, BACE activity was not evident with CM from Sf21 cells that were infected with control virus stock (Fig. 2 B). Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed that cleavage of L-405,492 was occurring at the β-secretase scissile bond (data not shown). The addition of the protease inhibitors, EDTA, aprotinin, and leupeptin did not block BACE activity in the CM from BACE460 virus stock-infected cells. However, the BACE activity in the CM was completely suppressed by the BACE inhibitor, P10-P4′ Stat(Val) (Fig. 2 B). CM from cells infected with the BACE460 virus stock that was extensively immunodepleted of proteins possessing the Pro region of BACE (as described above) exhibits an approximate 60% reduction of apparent BACE activity when compared with control antibody-treated CM (Fig. 2 C). This result provided the initial indication that a Pro region-containing form of BACE displayed activity. The decrease of BACE activity in CM caused by the immunocapture step with anti-Pro antibody was totally blocked when the hapten, Pro peptide, was also present (Fig. 2 C). The presence of both residual BACE activity and anti-protease (but not anti-Pro) immunoreactivity after exhaustive immunodepletion of ProBACE460 in the CM indicates that a lesser non-Pro region-containing BACE species in the CM also displays BACE activity. The CM from BACE460 virus stock-infected Sf21 cells was spiked with aprotinin/leupeptin and fractionated by lectin affinity chromatography using immobilized concanavalin A. The BACE activity was partially captured and eluted with α-d-glucopyranoside and methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside (approximate 60% recovery). The fractions containing the BACE activity were pooled, concentrated, and subjected to affinity chromatography using immobilized P10-P4′ Stat(Val) (3Sinha S. Anderson J.P. Barbour R. Basi G.S. Caccavello R. Davis D. Doan M. Dovey H.F. Frigon N. Hong J. Jacobson-Croak K. Jewett N. Keim P. Knops J. Lieberburg I. Power M. Tan H. Tatsuno G. Tung J. Schenk D. Seubert P. Suomensaari S.M. Wang S. Walker D. Zhao J. McConlogue L. John V. Nature. 1999; 402: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). The BACE activity was bound and subsequently eluted at pH 7.2. The final recovery of BACE activity was ∼15%. The BACE preparation that was isolated from the CM of BACE460 virus stock-infected Sf21 cells exhibited a single band when subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.3 A, lane 1). SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis using the antibodies against the Pro or protease regions of BACE both reacted with this species (Fig.3 B, lane 1, upper and lower panels, respectively). The purified BACE-related species is a glycoprotein as judged by its capture by immobilized concanavalin A and its increased mobility during SDS-PAGE after treatment with endoglycosidases (data not shown). Edman degradation of purified BACE, which was isolated from CM revealed an N terminus that began exclusively at the Pro region of BACE (Fig.3 C). 2Attempts to produce ProBACE460 in Sf21 cells by baculovirus-mediated expression using serum-free CM (Kemp Biotechnologies Inc., Frederick, MD) resulted in an approximate 50:50 mixture of ProBACE460 and mature BACE460 after purification by sequential concanavalin A and P10-P4′Stat(Val) affinity chromatography. ProBACE460 was further purified to apparent homogeneity from this mixture by immunoaffinity chromatography with anti-Pro antibody that is cross-linked to protein G-agarose (using the Immunopure Protein G IgG Plus Orientation kit; Pierce). The ProBACE460 was eluted from the antibody column using IgG elution buffer (Pierce). The ProBACE460 that was purified in this manner was homogenous as judged by N-terminal sequencing. Moreover, it displayed activity that was similar to ProBACE460, which was purified and characterized as described elsewhere in the manuscript (unpublished data). Control N-terminal sequencing runs with ProBACE460 spiked with varying amounts of mature BACE460 (prepared as described below) established that a 5% or greater contamination of ProBACE460 with BACE460 would be detected. The apparent homogeneity of the ProBACE460 preparation was corroborated by the absence of BACE immunoreactive material, using either the anti-Pro (Fig. 3 B, lane 3, upper panel) or anti-protease (Fig. 3 B, lane 3,lower panel) antibodies, after the ProBACE460 preparation was immunodepleted using antibody versus the Pro region. The cellular protease that processes ProBACE to yield mature BACE was recently shown to be furin (10Bennett B.D. Denis P. Haniu M. Teplow D.B. Kahn S. Louis J.-C. Citron Vassar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37712-37717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The minimal consensus sequence for furin-mediated cleavage, Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Arg (11Molloy S.S. Breshnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is situated at the C terminus of the Pro region of BACE. We thus treated purified ProBACE460 with furin and used SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting to monitor for time-dependent processing. The reactivity of ProBACE460 with the anti-Pro antibody is markedly diminished and eventually eliminated as the incubation time with furin is lengthened (Fig.4 A, upper panel). On the other hand, the reactivity with the anti-protease antibody was largely unaffected (Fig. 4 A, lower panel). Importantly, N-terminal sequence analysis established that furin cleaves ProBACE460 at the junction between the putative Pro and protease domains to yield BACE460 (Fig. 3 C). A larger amount of BACE460 was obtained for further characterization by treating ProBACE460 (625 μg) with furin and rechromatographing the sample on the P10-P4′ Stat(Val) affinity column. The protein recovered from the affinity column (386 μg) was shown to be BACE460 from its failure to react with anti-Pro antibody by immunoblot analysis (Fig.3 B, lane 4, upper panel) and N-terminal sequencing analysis (data not shown). Moreover, in contrast to the ProBACE460 preparation, treatment of BACE460 with immobilized anti-Pro antibody failed to deplete the BACE-related species as detected by immunoblotting using the anti-protease antibody (Fig.3 B, compare lanes 3 and 6, lower panel). The purified ProBACE460 preparation exhibits appreciable activity toward L-405,492. Indeed, assaying the proteolytic activity of ProBACE460 enabled its isolation. Treatment of the purified ProBACE460 preparation with immobilized anti-Pro antibody resulted in the loss of >90% of the BACE activity (data not shown). Moreover, assay of the pellet containing ProBACE460 tethered to the immobilized anti-Pro antibody revealed appreciable BACE activity (data not shown). The results of this immunocapture experiment establish that ProBACE460 itself, and not a non-Pro region-containing contaminant, is responsible for the observed activity in the ProBACE460 preparation. Processing of ProBACE460 to BACE460 by furin is accompanied by a modest increase in BACE activity toward L-405,492, which inversely mirrored the loss in anti-Pro reactivity that was detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 4 B). There was an approximate 2-fold increase in BACE activity after a 4-h incubation with furin. In an independent experiment, treatment of ProBACE460 with furin for 4 and 20 h increased BACE activity by 2.0- and 2.8-fold, respectively (Fig.4 C). As expected, treatment of BACE460 with furin did not increase BACE activity (Fig. 4 C). Incubation of L-405,492 with furin alone did not cause the generation of product (data not shown). Cleavage of L-405,492 by purified ProBACE460 and BACE460 displayed a linear dependence on substrate concentration up to 100 μmof substrate (Fig. 5). The absence of detectable saturation is in agreement with the results from a previous BACE study that used a polypeptide substrate of similar length (3Sinha S. Anderson J.P. Barbour R. Basi G.S.

https://openalex.org/W1580506053,"Liquid crystalline behaviour is generally limited to a select group of specially designed bulk substances. By contrast, it is a common feature of simple molecular monolayers and other quasi-two-dimensional systems1, which often possess a type of in-plane ordering that results from unbinding of dislocations—a ‘hexatic’ liquid crystalline phase. The flow of monolayers is closely related to molecular transport in biological membranes, affects foam and emulsion stability and is relevant to microfluidics research. For liquid crystalline phases, it is important to understand the coupling of the molecular orientation to the flow. Orientationally ordered (nematic) phases in bulk liquid crystals exhibit ‘shear aligning’ or ‘tumbling’ behaviour under shear, and are described quantitatively by Leslie–Ericksen theory2. For hexatic monolayers, the effects of flow have been inferred from textures of Langmuir–Blodgett films3,4,5 and directly observed at the macroscopic level6,7,8,9,10. However, there is no accepted model of hexatic flow at the molecular level. Here we report observations of a hexatic Langmuir monolayer that reveal continuous, shear-induced molecular precession, interrupted by occasional jump discontinuities. Although superficially similar to tumbling in a bulk nematic phase, the kinematic details are quite different and provide a possible mechanism for domain coarsening and eventual molecular alignment in monolayers. We explain the precession and jumps within a quantitative framework that involves coupling of molecular orientation to the local molecular hexatic ‘lattice’, which is continuously deformed by shear."

Mulliez E. Banerjee R. B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 731-756Google Scholar). The dNTPs are obtained by direct reduction of their corresponding ribonucleotides in a reaction basically similar for the three RNR classes and initiated by hydrogen abstraction at the C3′ ribose substrate by a cysteinyl radical (2Stubbe J. van der Donk W.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). The cysteinyl radical itself is derived from a stable protein radical (a tyrosyl radical in class I and a glycyl radical in class III) or from an organometallic cofactor (class II).In the anaerobic class III enzyme from Escherichia coli, the protein radical is located on the polypeptide backbone at the Gly681 residue of the dimeric α2 (2 × 80 kDa) protein (3Sun X.

In the inactive resting state, the two proteins α and β forms a tight α2β2 complex, but under the reducing conditions leading to the introduction of the radical (the activation reaction), the small β protein is able to activate several molecules of the α protein (6Ollagnier S.

In class III enzymes the electrons needed for the reduction of the ribonucleotides are provided by formate (11Mulliez E. Ollagnier S. Fontecave M. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8759-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Logan D.T. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Science. 1999; 283: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). On the contrary, in classes I and II, these electrons are supplied by NADPH through thioredoxin or glutaredoxin (13Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this paper, we show that the thioredoxin system efficiently replaces DTT during activation of class III RNR. Our data suggest that this system keeps the conserved cysteines of the C terminus of the α polypeptide in a reduced form needed for radical generation. This result solves an intriguing question concerning the function of DTT and the identity of its unknown physiological counterpart.RESULTSAssay of the anaerobic reductase activity is routinely measured by the formation of dCTP. The α protein is first activated under anaerobic conditions by a 1-h incubation with a source of electrons (the flavodoxin system or chemical reductants), AdoMet, and the activating β protein (6Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9410-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This step is absolutely dependent on the presence of small thiol molecules, the most effective being DTT (10Ollagnier S. Meier C. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Schuenemann V. Trautwein A.X. Mattioli T. Lutz M. Fontecave M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 6344-6350Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In a second step, the reduction step, the activated enzyme is incubated with the CTP substrate, the positive effector ATP, Mg2+, and formate. SAH can be added to this step to allow for the reduction to proceed in the absence of further activation (16Harder J. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Ballinger M.D. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25548-25552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This standard assay was here modified by addition of 100 μm EDTA in the buffer as this greatly stimulated the activity. 2Unpublished results.As shown in Fig. 1 we demonstrated that, with catalytic thioredoxin oxidoreductase and NADPH, thioredoxin was, at micromolar concentration, at least as efficient as DTT in the millimolar range for enzyme activity. TRXs from different sources (E. coli and A. thaliana) were found equally effective (not shown). A Km(app) of 0.8 ± 0.3 μm for TRX from E. coli in this reaction has been determined (Fig. 1, inset). Moreover the effect of TRX on the activity was restricted to the activation step only because there was almost no activity when TRX was added in the reduction step along with SAH. This behavior closely resembled that observed with DTT. No TRX-dependent activity could be observed in the absence of TRR.In Fig. 2 is shown the time-dependent decrease of the absorbance of NADPH (1.6 mm) at 340 nm when a solution of the α protein (820 μm) was complemented inside the glove box first with TRR (1.3 μm) and after 10 min with TRX (5.7 μm). Control experiments done without protein α showed a negligible decrease of the absorbance at 340 nm compared with that seen in Fig. 2. Quantitative analysis of these data showed that the reaction was almost completed after 90 min when about 820 μm of NADPH has been converted to NADP+. This amount exactly matched the concentration of the α polypeptide. This indicated that protein α enjoyed a 2-electron reduction, and because this reaction is catalyzed by TRX it also strongly suggested that, in the as-isolated form, protein α carries a disulfide group amenable to reduction. Taken together these experiments suggest that the activation of the anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase is dependent on the presence of cysteine-free SH groups on protein α.Figure 2TRX-mediated oxidation of NADPH by the α protein. In a 1-mm optical path UV-visible cuvette, the α protein (820 μm) was incubated inside the glove box with NADPH (1.6 mm) and thioredoxin reductase (1.3 μm) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 50 mmKCl, pH 8.0. After 11 min, TRX (5.7 μm) was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 90 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reduced protein α, after treatment with the TRX system as depicted in Fig. 2, was isolated by chromatography on an affinity dATP-Sepharose column inside the glove box. After washing the column with 5 volumes of buffer, the reduced protein was eluted with the admission of 1 mm ATP in buffer. It was then assayed for its CTP reductase activity. In Fig. 3 is compared the activity of the reduced protein α isolated after dATP-Sepharose with that of the as-isolated (oxidized) protein α in the presence or in the absence of DTT. The activity was linearly correlated with the amount of enzyme except for the data at high protein concentration, which may be explained by the near exhaustion of the substrate. In agreement with previous data, the oxidized α protein alone was found completely inactive and required DTT for activity (10Ollagnier S. Meier C. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Schuenemann V. Trautwein A.X. Mattioli T. Lutz M. Fontecave M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 6344-6350Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the reduced α protein was found active in the absence of any additional reductant and displayed the highest enzyme activity. The same results essentially were obtained when protein α was treated with DTT and isolated by Sephadex G-25 chromatography under strict anaerobic conditions (data not shown). However, in that case, reduction of protein α required a high concentration of reductant (100 mm) and long incubation time.Figure 3CTP reductase activity of the α protein.

However, as shown in Fig. 4, using reduced protein α in the absence of DTT or TRX, activation occurred at a much faster rate, because about 50% of the maximal activity was achieved in less than 1 min. It is thus very likely that in the previously reported studies, enzyme activation was in fact rate-limited by reduction of protein α.Figure 4Time course for the activation of protein α.

Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). They participate either as a thiyl radical for initiating substrate reduction or as a dithiol in the subsequent steps leading to the deoxyribose product (2Stubbe J. van der Donk W.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar, 17Lawrence C.C. Bennati M. Obias H.V. Bar G. Griffin R.G. Stubbe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8979-8984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The latter cysteine pair is maintained in the reduced form by thioredoxin or glutaredoxin (13Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In class III RNR, alignments of the 20 nrdD sequences presently available have revealed, among the 15–20 Cys generally present, the occurrence of five invariants, one highly conserved and three moderately conserved cysteine residues (18Andersson J. Activation, Reaction Mechanism and Allosteric Regulation of the Anaerobic Ribonucleotide Reductase from Bacteriophage T4. Doctoral dissertation. Stockholm University, Edsbruk, Sweden2000Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies done on the enzyme from the bacteriophage T4 have demonstrated that two of these invariants are directly involved in the turnover of the reaction in agreement with the presence of two cysteines in the substrate site observed in the three-dimensional structure of the protein (12Logan D.T. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Science. 1999; 283: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 19Andersson J. Westman M. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19449-19455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The three other invariants are part of a CXXCX14CXXC motif (not visible in the three-dimensional structure) located in the C terminus of the polypeptide. Each of these cysteines was essential for the formation of Gly⋅ and was thus proposed to participate to radical transfer reactions during enzyme activation (19Andersson J. Westman M. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19449-19455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Activation of class III RNR has long been known to be a slow process and to rely upon the obligate presence of DTT in the activation mix (14Eliasson R. Pontis E. Fontecave M. Gerez C. Harder J. Jörnvall H. Krook M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25541-25547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, nothing was known about the function of DTT or the nature of its physiological counterpart. The data reported here strongly suggest that the role of DTT was to reduce an unsuspected disulfide on protein α. From the study of Andersson et al. (19Andersson J. Westman M. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19449-19455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), it is likely that this disulfide, in the E. coli enzyme, is located on the Cys662/665 pair, but this has to be confirmed with appropriate mutants. This disulfide can be reduced by the TRX/TRR system resulting in a fully active enzyme. As a consequence, reduced protein α can now be activated in a fast reaction that does not require DTT or the TRX/TRR system anymore.It thus seems that, in previous studies with the oxidized preparations, protein α activation not only resided in the introduction of the glycyl radical but also implicated the reduction of important cysteines by DTT. The fact that the activation reaction becomes much faster with reduced protein α (Fig. 4) indicates that the rate-limiting step during DTT-dependent activation reaction was not the generation of Gly⋅ by itself but instead the reduction of protein α.At this stage it is difficult to know the exact function of the thiols in the C terminus of protein α. They may have a structural role in the binding of protein β and/or AdoMet. They also may be involved in a radical chain transfer from AdoMet, supposed to bind at the interface of the two proteins α and β, to the glycine residue on protein α as proposed by Andersson et al. (19Andersson J. Westman M. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19449-19455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Finally they could be directly involved in the cleavage of AdoMet. Our recent finding that the latter reaction is triggered by addition of DTT to the (4Fe-4S)+/AdoMet complex on one hand and that DTT binds to the cluster 3Unpublished results. in the other makes this third alternative very attractive (8Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Schmidt P.P. Eliasson R. Gaillard J. Deronzier C. Bergman T. Gräslund A. Reichard P. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24216-24223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).It is well established now that very few cystine pairs survive the reducing conditions existing inside the anaerobic cell (20Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 21Prinz W.A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15661-15667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). In addition to the redoxin systems, E. coli contains a high concentration of GSH, itself able to sustain CTP reductase activityin vitro (not shown). So, in vivo, protein α is likely to have all of its cysteines in their reduced form providing conditions for a rapid activation. The requirement for DTT or TRXin vitro might just be a consequence of the isolation and oxygen sensitivity of the protein. The study of the activation reaction conducted with reduced protein α is expected to solve many of the questions still unanswered. Class III ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs)1 are found in anaerobic bacteria where they supply the cell with the dNTPs needed for DNA chain elongation and repair (1Fontecave M. Mulliez E. Banerjee R. B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 731-756Google Scholar). The dNTPs are obtained by direct reduction of their corresponding ribonucleotides in a reaction basically similar for the three RNR classes and initiated by hydrogen abstraction at the C3′ ribose substrate by a cysteinyl radical (2Stubbe J. van der Donk W.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). The cysteinyl radical itself is derived from a stable protein radical (a tyrosyl radical in class I and a glycyl radical in class III) or from an organometallic cofactor (class II). In the anaerobic class III enzyme from Escherichia coli, the protein radical is located on the polypeptide backbone at the Gly681 residue of the dimeric α2 (2 × 80 kDa) protein (3Sun X. Ollagnier S. Schmidt P.P. Atta M. Mulliez E. Lepape L. Eliasson R. Graslünd A. Fontecave M. Reichard P. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6827-6831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The glycyl radical (Gly⋅) is formed by the concerted action of the following four components: (i) a reducing system consisting of NADPH, flavodoxin, and NADPH:flavodoxin reductase (4Bianchi V.

Mulliez E. Schmidt P.P. Eliasson R. Gaillard J. Deronzier C. Bergman T. Gräslund A. Reichard P. Fontecave M. J. Biol.

(2001) Biochemistry, in press.Google Scholar). The reaction also requires (iv) dithiothreitol (DTT), a nonphysiological reductant (10Ollagnier S. Meier C. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Schuenemann V. Trautwein A.X. Mattioli T. Lutz M. Fontecave M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 6344-6350Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the inactive resting state, the two proteins α and β forms a tight α2β2 complex, but under the reducing conditions leading to the introduction of the radical (the activation reaction), the small β protein is able to activate several molecules of the α protein (6Ollagnier S.

Trautwein A. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31291-31296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A second characteristic sets class III apart from the two other classes. In class III enzymes the electrons needed for the reduction of the ribonucleotides are provided by formate (11Mulliez E. Ollagnier S. Fontecave M. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8759-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Logan D.T. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Science. 1999; 283: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). On the contrary, in classes I and II, these electrons are supplied by NADPH through thioredoxin or glutaredoxin (13Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that the thioredoxin system efficiently replaces DTT during activation of class III RNR. Our data suggest that this system keeps the conserved cysteines of the C terminus of the α polypeptide in a reduced form needed for radical generation. This result solves an intriguing question concerning the function of DTT and the identity of its unknown physiological counterpart. RESULTSAssay of the anaerobic reductase activity is routinely measured by the formation of dCTP. The α protein is first activated under anaerobic conditions by a 1-h incubation with a source of electrons (the flavodoxin system or chemical reductants), AdoMet, and the activating β protein (6Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9410-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This step is absolutely dependent on the presence of small thiol molecules, the most effective being DTT (10Ollagnier S. Meier C. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Schuenemann V. Trautwein A.X. Mattioli T. Lutz M. Fontecave M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 6344-6350Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In a second step, the reduction step, the activated enzyme is incubated with the CTP substrate, the positive effector ATP, Mg2+, and formate. SAH can be added to this step to allow for the reduction to proceed in the absence of further activation (16Harder J. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Ballinger M.D. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25548-25552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This standard assay was here modified by addition of 100 μm EDTA in the buffer as this greatly stimulated the activity. 2Unpublished results.As shown in Fig. 1 we demonstrated that, with catalytic thioredoxin oxidoreductase and NADPH, thioredoxin was, at micromolar concentration, at least as efficient as DTT in the millimolar range for enzyme activity. TRXs from different sources (E. coli and A. thaliana) were found equally effective (not shown). A Km(app) of 0.8 ± 0.3 μm for TRX from E. coli in this reaction has been determined (Fig. 1, inset). Moreover the effect of TRX on the activity was restricted to the activation step only because there was almost no activity when TRX was added in the reduction step along with SAH. This behavior closely resembled that observed with DTT. No TRX-dependent activity could be observed in the absence of TRR.In Fig. 2 is shown the time-dependent decrease of the absorbance of NADPH (1.6 mm) at 340 nm when a solution of the α protein (820 μm) was complemented inside the glove box first with TRR (1.3 μm) and after 10 min with TRX (5.7 μm). Control experiments done without protein α showed a negligible decrease of the absorbance at 340 nm compared with that seen in Fig. 2. Quantitative analysis of these data showed that the reaction was almost completed after 90 min when about 820 μm of NADPH has been converted to NADP+. This amount exactly matched the concentration of the α polypeptide. This indicated that protein α enjoyed a 2-electron reduction, and because this reaction is catalyzed by TRX it also strongly suggested that, in the as-isolated form, protein α carries a disulfide group amenable to reduction.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19449-19455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Activation of class III RNR has long been known to be a slow process and to rely upon the obligate presence of DTT in the activation mix (14Eliasson R. Pontis E. Fontecave M. Gerez C. Harder J. Jörnvall H. Krook M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25541-25547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, nothing was known about the function of DTT or the nature of its physiological counterpart. The data reported here strongly suggest that the role of DTT was to reduce an unsuspected disulfide on protein α. From the study of Andersson et al. (19Andersson J. Westman M. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19449-19455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), it is likely that this disulfide, in the E. coli enzyme, is located on the Cys662/665 pair, but this has to be confirmed with appropriate mutants. This disulfide can be reduced by the TRX/TRR system resulting in a fully active enzyme. As a consequence, reduced protein α can now be activated in a fast reaction that does not require DTT or the TRX/TRR system anymore.It thus seems that, in previous studies with the oxidized preparations, protein α activation not only resided in the introduction of the glycyl radical but also implicated the reduction of important cysteines by DTT. The fact that the activation reaction becomes much faster with reduced protein α (Fig. 4) indicates that the rate-limiting step during DTT-dependent activation reaction was not the generation of Gly⋅ by itself but instead the reduction of protein α.At this stage it is difficult to know the exact function of the thiols in the C terminus of protein α. They may have a structural role in the binding of protein β and/or AdoMet. They also may be involved in a radical chain transfer from AdoMet, supposed to bind at the interface of the two proteins α and β, to the glycine residue on protein α as proposed by Andersson et al. (19Andersson J. Westman M. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19449-19455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Finally they could be directly involved in the cleavage of AdoMet. Our recent finding that the latter reaction is triggered by addition of DTT to the (4Fe-4S)+/AdoMet complex on one hand and that DTT binds to the cluster 3Unpublished results. in the other makes this third alternative very attractive (8Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Schmidt P.P. Eliasson R. Gaillard J. Deronzier C. Bergman T. Gräslund A. Reichard P. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24216-24223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).It is well established now that very few cystine pairs survive the reducing conditions existing inside the anaerobic cell (20Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 21Prinz W.A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15661-15667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). In addition to the redoxin systems, E. coli contains a high concentration of GSH, itself able to sustain CTP reductase activityin vitro (not shown). So, in vivo, protein α is likely to have all of its cysteines in their reduced form providing conditions for a rapid activation. The requirement for DTT or TRXin vitro might just be a consequence of the isolation and oxygen sensitivity of the protein. The study of the activation reaction conducted with reduced protein α is expected to solve many of the questions still unanswered. Cysteines are central to the activity of class I and II ribonucleotide reductases (2Stubbe J. van der Donk W.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). They participate either as a thiyl radical for initiating substrate reduction or as a dithiol in the subsequent steps leading to the deoxyribose product (2Stubbe J. van der Donk W.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar, 17Lawrence C.C. Bennati M. Obias H.V. Bar G. Griffin R.G. Stubbe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8979-8984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The latter cysteine pair is maintained in the reduced form by thioredoxin or glutaredoxin (13Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In class III RNR, alignments of the 20 nrdD sequences presently available have revealed, among the 15–20 Cys generally present, the occurrence of five invariants, one highly conserved and three moderately conserved cysteine residues (18Andersson J. Activation, Reaction Mechanism and Allosteric Regulation of the Anaerobic Ribonucleotide Reductase from Bacteriophage T4. Doctoral dissertation. Stockholm University, Edsbruk, Sweden2000Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies done on the enzyme from the bacteriophage T4 have demonstrated that two of these invariants are directly involved in the turnover of the reaction in agreement with the presence of two cysteines in the substrate site observed in the three-dimensional structure of the protein (12Logan D.T. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Science. 1999; 283: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 19Andersson J. Westman M. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19449-19455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The three other invariants are part of a CXXCX14CXXC motif (not visible in the three-dimensional structure) located in the C terminus of the polypeptide. Each of these cysteines was essential for the formation of Gly⋅ and was thus proposed to participate to radical transfer reactions during enzyme activation (19Andersson J. Westman M. Sahlin M.
