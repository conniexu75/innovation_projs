https://openalex.org/W2789833091,"Clinical measurements can be viewed as useful intermediate phenotypes to promote understanding of complex human diseases. To acquire comprehensive insights into the underlying genetics, here we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 58 quantitative traits in 162,255 Japanese individuals. Overall, we identified 1,407 trait-associated loci (P < 5.0 × 10−8), 679 of which were novel. By incorporating 32 additional GWAS results for complex diseases and traits in Japanese individuals, we further highlighted pleiotropy, genetic correlations, and cell-type specificity across quantitative traits and diseases, which substantially expands the current understanding of the associated genetics and biology. This study identified both shared polygenic effects and cell-type specificity, represented by the genetic links among clinical measurements, complex diseases, and relevant cell types. Our findings demonstrate that even without prior biological knowledge of cross-phenotype relationships, genetics corresponding to clinical measurements successfully recapture those measurements’ relevance to diseases, and thus can contribute to the elucidation of unknown etiology and pathogenesis. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 58 traits using data from the Biobank Japan Project identifies 1,407 loci, 679 of which are novel. Comparison with disease GWASs and analysis of genetic correlations and cell-type enrichment show that these clinical measurements are relevant to human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2794050431,"Animal models of Alzheimer's disease have suggested that tau pathology propagation, facilitated by amyloid pathology, may occur along connected pathways. To investigate these ideas in humans, we combined amyloid scans with longitudinal data on white matter connectivity, hippocampal volume, tau positron emission tomography and memory performance in 256 cognitively healthy older individuals. Lower baseline hippocampal volume was associated with increased mean diffusivity of the connecting hippocampal cingulum bundle (HCB). HCB diffusivity predicted tau accumulation in the downstream-connected posterior cingulate cortex in amyloid-positive but not in amyloid-negative individuals. Furthermore, HCB diffusivity predicted memory decline in amyloid-positive individuals with high posterior cingulate cortex tau binding. Our results provide in vivo evidence that higher amyloid pathology strengthens the association between HCB diffusivity and tau accumulation in the downstream posterior cingulate cortex and facilitates memory decline. This confirms amyloid's crucial role in potentiating neural vulnerability and memory decline marking the onset of preclinical Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2790780682,"In Huntington's disease (HD), expansion of CAG codons in the huntingtin gene (HTT) leads to the aberrant formation of protein aggregates and the differential degeneration of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Modeling HD using patient-specific MSNs has been challenging, as neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells are free of aggregates and lack an overt cell death phenotype. Here we generated MSNs from HD patient fibroblasts through microRNA-based direct neuronal conversion, bypassing the induction of pluripotency and retaining age signatures of the original fibroblasts. We found that patient MSNs consistently exhibited mutant HTT (mHTT) aggregates, mHTT-dependent DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and spontaneous degeneration in culture over time. We further provide evidence that erasure of age stored in starting fibroblasts or neuronal conversion of presymptomatic HD patient fibroblasts results in differential manifestation of cellular phenotypes associated with HD, highlighting the importance of age in modeling late-onset neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2797856206,"The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in the extinction of emotional memories, including conditioned fear. We found that ventral hippocampal (vHPC) projections to the infralimbic (IL) cortex recruited parvalbumin-expressing interneurons to counter the expression of extinguished fear and promote fear relapse. Whole-cell recordings ex vivo revealed that optogenetic activation of vHPC input to amygdala-projecting pyramidal neurons in the IL was dominated by feed-forward inhibition. Selectively silencing parvalbumin-expressing, but not somatostatin-expressing, interneurons in the IL eliminated vHPC-mediated inhibition. In behaving rats, pharmacogenetic activation of vHPC→IL projections impaired extinction recall, whereas silencing IL projectors diminished fear renewal. Intra-IL infusion of GABA receptor agonists or antagonists, respectively, reproduced these effects. Together, our findings describe a previously unknown circuit mechanism for the contextual control of fear, and indicate that vHPC-mediated inhibition of IL is an essential neural substrate for fear relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2784588851,"Phagocytosis of silicon dioxide (SiO2) into lung cells causes an inflammatory cascade that results in fibroblast proliferation and migration, followed by fibrosis. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a subclass of noncoding RNAs that are present within mammalian cells; however, researchers have not determined whether circRNAs are involved in the pathophysiologic process of silicosis. To elucidate the role of these RNAs in SiO2-induced inflammation in pulmonary macrophages, we investigated the upstream molecular mechanisms and functional effects of circRNAs on cell apoptosis, proliferation, and migration. Primary cultures of alveolar macrophages from healthy donors and from patients and the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line were used to explore the functions of circZC3H4 RNA in macrophage activation. The experimental results indicated the following: 1) SiO2 concomitantly increased circZC3H4 RNA expression and increased ZC3H4 protein levels; 2) circular ZC3H4 (circZC3H4) RNA and ZC3H4 protein participated in SiO2-induced macrophage activation; and 3) SiO2-activated macrophages promoted fibroblast proliferation and migration via the circZC3H4 RNA/ZC3H4 pathway. The up-regulation of the ZC3H4 protein was confirmed in tissue samples from patients with silicosis. Our study elucidates a link between SiO2-induced macrophage activation and the circZC3H4 RNA/ZC3H4 pathway, thereby providing novel insight into the potential use of ZC3H4 to develop novel therapeutic strategies for silicosis.-Yang, X., Wang, J., Zhou, Z., Jiang, R., Huang, J., Chen, L., Cao, Z., Chu, H., Han, B., Cheng, Y., Chao, J.

https://openalex.org/W2784357120,"The activation of microglia and the various substances they produce have been linked to the pathologic development of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the precise role of microglia in PD remains to be defined. The survival of microglia depends on colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling, and CSF1R inhibition results in rapid elimination of microglia in the central nervous system. Using a mouse PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment, we showed that the depletion of microglia via the CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397 exacerbated the impairment of locomotor activities and the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Further, depletion of microglia augmented the production of inflammatory mediators and infiltration of leukocytes in the brain after MPTP exposure. Microglia depletion-induced aggravation of MPTP neurotoxicity was also seen in lymphocyte-deficient mice. In addition, the depletion of microglia did not affect the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, but it dramatically augmented the production of inflammatory mediators by astrocytes after MPTP treatment. Our findings suggest microglia play a protective role against MPTP-induced neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neurotoxicity.—Yang, X., Ren, H., Wood, K., Li, M., Qiu, S., Shi, F.-D., Ma, C., Liu, Q.

https://openalex.org/W2785599765,"Obesity and diabetes are major challenges to global health, and there is an urgent need for interventions that promote weight loss. Dietary restriction of methionine promotes leanness and improves metabolic health in mice and humans. However, poor long-term adherence to this diet limits its translational potential. In this study, we develop a short-term methionine deprivation (MD) regimen that preferentially reduces fat mass, restoring normal body weight and glycemic control to diet-induced obese mice of both sexes. The benefits of MD do not accrue from calorie restriction, but instead result from increased energy expenditure. MD promotes increased energy expenditure in a sex-specific manner, inducing the fibroblast growth factor (Fgf)-21-uncoupling protein (Ucp)-1 axis only in males. Methionine is an agonist of the protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex (mTORC)-1, which has been proposed to play a key role in the metabolic response to amino acid-restricted diets. In our study, we used a mouse model of constitutive hepatic mTORC1 activity and demonstrate that suppression of hepatic mTORC1 signaling is not required for the metabolic effects of MD. Our study sheds new light on the mechanisms by which dietary methionine regulates metabolic health and demonstrates the translational potential of MD for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes.-Yu, D., Yang, S.

https://openalex.org/W2782765623,"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption caused by reperfusion injury after ischemic stroke is an intractable event conducive to further injury. Brain pericytes play a vital role in maintaining BBB integrity by interacting with other components of the BBB. In this study, we found that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR)2 expressed in pericytes was significantly up-regulated after ischemia in vivo and in vitro. By using a S1PR2 antagonist (JTE-013), we showed that S1PR2 plays a critical role in the induction of BBB permeability of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) rats and the in vitro BBB model. Furthermore, we discovered that S1PR2 may decrease N-cadherin expression and increase pericyte migration via NF-κB p65 signal and found that S1PR2 could be regulated by miR-149–5p negatively, which was decreased in the ischemic boundary zone and cultured pericytes after ischemia. Overexpression of miR-149–5p in cultured pericytes substantially increased N-cadherin expression and decreased pericyte migration, which decreased BBB leakage in the in vitro model. Up-regulating miR-149–5p by intracerebroventricular injection of agomir-149–5p attenuated BBB permeability and improved the outcomes of tMCAO rats significantly. Thus, our data suggest that miR-149–5p may serve as a potential target for treatment of BBB disruption after ischemic stroke.—Wan, Y., Jin, H.-J., Zhu, Y.-Y., Fang Z., Mao, L., He, Q., Xia, Y.-P., Li, M., Li, Y., Chen, X., Hu, B.

https://openalex.org/W2786209083,"Hydroxysteroid (17β) dehydrogenases (HSD17Bs) form an enzyme family characterized by their ability to catalyze reactions in steroid and lipid metabolism. In the present study, we characterized the phenotype of HSD17B13-knockout (HSD17B13KO) mice deficient in Hsd17b13. In these studies, hepatic steatosis was detected in HSD17B13KO male mice, indicated by histologic analysis and by the increased triglyceride concentration in the liver, whereas reproductive performance and serum steroid concentrations were normal in HSD17B13KO mice. In line with these changes, the expression of key proteins in fatty acid synthesis, such as FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, and SCD1, was increased in the HSD17B13KO liver. Furthermore, the knockout liver showed an increase in 2 acylcarnitines, suggesting impaired mitochondrial β-oxidation in the presence of unaltered malonyl CoA and AMPK expression. The glucose tolerance did not differ between wild-type and HSD17B13KO mice in the presence of lower levels of glucose 6-phosphatase in HSD17B13KO liver compared with wild-type liver. Furthermore, microgranulomas and increased portal inflammation together with up-regulation of immune response genes were observed in HSD17B13KO mice. Our data indicate that disruption of Hsd17b13 impairs hepatic-lipid metabolism in mice, resulting in liver steatosis and inflammation, but the enzyme does not play a major role in the regulation of reproductive functions.-Adam, M., Heikelä, H., Sobolewski, C., Portius, D., Mäki-Jouppila, J., Mehmood, A., Adhikari, P., Esposito, I., Elo, L.

https://openalex.org/W2785137851,"Lipids secreted from the meibomian gland (meibum) form the superficial layer of the tear film and prevent water evaporation from the ocular surface and infection. Here, we identified the fatty acid (FA) elongases responsible for the synthesis of very long-chain FAs (VLCFAs) that constitute the meibum lipids. Elongation of VLCFAs (ELOVL)1 is primarily responsible for the production of saturated VLCFAs, whereas ELOVL1, ELOVL3, and ELOVL4 redundantly participate in the synthesis of monounsaturated VLCFAs. Gene disruption of Elovl1 in mice shortened acyl moieties in the 2 major meibum lipids: cholesteryl esters and wax esters. These changes were associated with dry eye phenotypes, including increases in eye-blink frequency and water evaporation from the ocular surface at younger ages. Aged Elovl1 mutant mice developed corneal opacity with vascular invasion, accompanied by epidermalization of the cornea. Thus, in addition to the well-known VLC ceramides (acylceramides) in the epidermis, VLC meibum lipids are barrier-forming lipids.—Sassa T., Tadaki, M., Kiyonari, H., Kihara A.

https://openalex.org/W2791366721,"High-fat, low-carbohydrate (CHO) diets increase whole-body rates of fat oxidation and down-regulate CHO metabolism. We measured substrate utilization and skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration to determine whether these adaptations are driven by high fat or low CHO availability. In a randomized crossover design, 8 male cyclists consumed 5 d of a high-CHO diet [>70% energy intake (EI)], followed by 5 d of either an isoenergetic high-fat (HFAT; >65% EI) or high-protein diet (HPRO; >65% EI) with CHO intake clamped at <20% EI. During the intervention, participants undertook daily exercise training. On d 6, participants consumed a high-CHO diet before performing 100 min of submaximal steady-state cycling plus an ~30-min time trial. After 5 d of HFAT, skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration supported by octanoylcarnitine and pyruvate, as well as uncoupled respiration, was decreased at rest, and rates of whole-body fat oxidation were higher during exercise compared with HPRO. After 1 d of high-CHO diet intake, mitochondrial respiration returned to baseline values in HFAT, whereas rates of substrate oxidation returned toward baseline in both conditions. These findings demonstrate that high dietary fat intake, rather than low-CHO intake, contributes to reductions in mitochondrial respiration and increases in whole-body rates of fat oxidation after a consuming a high-fat, low-CHO diet.—Leckey, J.

https://openalex.org/W2794059153,"Increased complement component 1q (C1q) secretion with aging leads to muscle fibrosis and atrophy whereas resistance training attenuates circulating C1q levels. This study aimed to clarify whether resistance exercise-induced reduction of C1q secretion contributes to the inhibition of fibrosis and atrophy in aged muscles. Young (13-wk-old) and aged (38-wk-old) senescence-accelerated mouse prone 1 mice were randomly assigned to one of 4 groups: a young or aged sedentary control group, or a young or aged resistance training (climbing a ladder 3 d/wk for 12 wk) group. We found that resistance training ameliorated muscle fibrosis and atrophy in aged mice, concomitant with decreased circulating and muscle C1q levels and attenuated activation of muscle Wnt signaling (glycogen synthase kinase β/β-catenin), including β-catenin in satellite (Pax7+/DAPI+) and fibroblast (vimentin+/DAPI+) cells. Furthermore, during muscle regeneration after mice were injured by cardiotoxin injection, we observed a reduction in circulating C1q levels, the inhibition of muscle fibrosis and repair, and decreased in the activation of muscle cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin in aged mice from the resistance training group, but these effects were cancelled by a single preadministration of exogenous recombinant C1q. In addition, resistance training attenuated aging-related muscle loss concomitant with decreased expression of both muscle ring-finger protein 1 and muscle atrophy F-box in the muscle. Thus, resistance training-induced changes in circulating C1q levels may contribute to the prevention of muscle fibrosis and atrophy via muscle Wnt signaling in senescent mice.-Horii, N., Uchida, M., Hasegawa, N., Fujie, S., Oyanagi, E., Yano, H., Hashimoto, T., Iemitsu, M.

https://openalex.org/W2783808220,"The microtubule-associated protein tau is highly expressed in pancreatic islets. Abnormally phosphorylated tau aggregates assemble into neurofibrillary tangles linked to Alzheimer's disease pathology and has also been found in islets of patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the significance of tau in islet function remains relatively unexplored. Therefore, we investigated the role of tau on β cell function and glucose homeostasis using tau knockout (tauKO) mice. TauKO mice were hyperglycemic and glucose intolerant at an early age. Islet insulin content was reduced and proinsulin levels were significantly elevated in tauKO mice, resulting in impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Loss of tau also resulted in increased epididymal fat mass and leptin levels, reduced glucose production, and insulin resistance at later ages, leading to complete onset of diabetes. Transgenic expression of human tau in islets was unable to rescue those defects in glucose regulation, indicating structural and/or functional differences between mouse and human tau. Cumulatively, these results suggest an important role for tau in the proper maintenance of pancreatic β cell function and glucose homeostasis.—Wijesekara, N., Gonçalves, R.

https://openalex.org/W2784036573,"Vimentin is a cytoskeletal intermediate filament protein that is expressed in mesenchymal cells and cancer cells during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The goal of this study was to identify vimentin-targeting small molecules by using the Tocriscreen library of 1120 biochemically active compounds. We monitored vimentin filament reorganization and bundling in adrenal carcinoma SW13 vimentin-positive (SW13-vim+) cells via indirect immunofluorescence. The screen identified 18 pharmacologically diverse hits that included 2 statins-simvastatin and mevastatin. Simvastatin induced vimentin reorganization within 15-30 min and significant perinuclear bundling within 60 min (IC50 = 6.7 nM). Early filament reorganization coincided with increased vimentin solubility. Mevastatin produced similar effects at >1 µM, whereas the structurally related pravastatin and lovastatin did not affect vimentin. In vitro vimentin filament assembly assays revealed a direct targeting mechanism, as determined biochemically and by electron microscopy. In SW13-vim+ cells, simvastatin, but not pravastatin, reduced total cell numbers (IC50 = 48.1 nM) and promoted apoptosis after 24 h. In contrast, SW13-vim- cell viability was unaffected by simvastatin, unless vimentin was ectopically expressed. Simvastatin similarly targeted vimentin filaments and induced cell death in MDA-MB-231 (vim+), but lacked effect in MCF7 (vim-) breast cancer cells. In conclusion, this study identified vimentin as a direct molecular target that mediates simvastatin-induced cell death in 2 different cancer cell lines.-Trogden, K. P., Battaglia, R. A., Kabiraj, P., Madden, V. J., Herrmann, H., Snider, N. T. An image-based small-molecule screen identifies vimentin as a pharmacologically relevant target of simvastatin in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2785418953,"Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often develop cognitive impairments and have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Hyperglycemia is a major characteristic of T2DM, but how elevated glucose levels lead to cognitive decline remains elusive. Here, we report that patients with T2DM and mutations in the formaldehyde (FA)-degrading enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ( ALDH2) gene had higher levels of FA and more severe dementia. Injection of FA induced hyperglycemia and cognitive deficits in rats. Ablation of gene expression of ALDH2, the main enzyme to oxidize FA, resulted in abnormally high levels of hippocampal FA, leading to hyperglycemia and cognitive impairments as well as potentiating streptozotocin-induced diabetes development in ALDH2 knockout mice. We found that FA interacts with insulin to form FA-insulin adducts, and these FA-insulin adducts caused insulin deficiency, contributing to memory decline in diabetic rodent models. Reduction of FA by transgenic overexpression of human ALDH2 attenuates hyperglycemia and alleviates cognitive deficits in diabetic mouse models. These findings suggest that excess FA plays a critical role in mediating diabetes-related dementia. Targeting FA and its metabolizing enzyme ALDH2 may be a valid approach for preventing and treating dementia in diabetes mellitus.-Tan, T., Zhang, Y., Luo, W., Lv, J., Han, C., Hamlin, J. N.

https://openalex.org/W2783571004,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a biolipid involved in chronic inflammation in several inflammatory disorders. Recent studies revealed that elevated S1P contributes to sickling in sickle cell disease (SCD), a devastating hemolytic, genetic disorder associated with severe chronic inflammation and tissue damage. We evaluated the effect of elevated S1P in chronic inflammation and tissue damage in SCD and underlying mechanisms. First, we demonstrated that interfering with S1P receptor signaling by FTY720, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug, significantly reduced systemic, local inflammation and tissue damage without antisickling effects. These findings led us to discover that S1P receptor activation leads to substantial elevated local and systemic IL-6 levels in SCD mice. Genetic deletion of IL-6 in SCD mice significantly reduced local and systemic inflammation, tissue damage, and kidney dysfunction. At the cellular level, we determined that elevated IL-6 is a key cytokine functioning downstream of elevated S1P, which contributes to increased S1P receptor 1 ( S1pr1) gene expression in the macrophages of several tissues in SCD mice. Mechanistically, we revealed that S1P-S1PR1 signaling reciprocally up-regulated IL-6 gene expression in primary mouse macrophages in a JAK2-dependent manner. Altogether, we revealed that elevated S1P, coupled with macrophage S1PR1 reciprocally inducing IL-6 expression, is a key signaling network functioning as a malicious, positive, feed-forward loop to sustain inflammation and promote tissue damage in SCD. Our findings immediately highlight novel therapeutic possibilities.-Zhao, S., Adebiyi, M. G., Zhang, Y., Couturier, J. P., Fan, X., Zhang, H., Kellems, R. E., Lewis, D. E., Xia, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2786635737,"Tetrandrine, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid, was previously demonstrated to attenuate inflammation and cartilage destruction in the ankles of mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Here, we explored the underlying mechanism by which tetrandrine prevented arthritis-induced bone erosion by focusing on the differentiation and function of osteoclasts. We found that daily administration of tetrandrine (30 mg/kg) markedly reduced the bone damage and decreased the number of osteoclasts in CIA rats. In vitro, tetrandrine inhibited receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis at the early stage and reduced the expressions of osteoclast-related marker genes. In bone marrow-derived macrophages and RAW264.7 cells, tetrandrine inhibited RANKL-induced translocation of NF-κB-p65 and nuclear factor of activated T cell 1 (NFATc1) through suppressing spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk)-Bruton's tyrosine kinase-PLCγ2-Ca2+ signaling. Of interest, tetrandrine did not affect the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs, the conventional upstream of Syk, but it inhibited the activity of Syk by enhancing its ubiquitination and degradation. The anti-osteoclastogenesis effect of tetrandrine nearly disappeared when it was used in combination with the Syk inhibitor piceatannol or in constitutively activated Syk-overexpressing cells. Taken together, tetrandrine attenuated CIA-induced bone destruction by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis through hindering the translocation of NF-κB-p65 and NFATc1 via reducing the activation of Syk.-Jia, Y., Miao, Y., Yue, M., Shu, M., Wei, Z., Dai, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2784659645,"The insulin family of growth factors (insulin, IGF1, and IGF2) are critical in sex determination, adrenal differentiation, and testicular function. Notably, the IGF system has been reported to mediate the proliferation of steroidogenic cells. However, the precise role and contribution of the membrane receptors mediating those effects, namely, insülin receptor (INSR) and type-I insülin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R), have not, to oür knowledge, been investigated. We show here that specific deletion of both Insr and Igf1r in steroidogenic cells in mice leads to severe alterations of adrenocortical and testicular development. Double-mutant mice display drastic size reduction of both adrenocortex and testes, with impaired corticosterone, testosterone, and sperm production. Detailed developmental analysis of the testes revealed that fetal Leydig cell (LC) function is normal, but there is a failure of adult LC maturation and steroidogenic function associated with accumulation of progenitor LCs (PLCs). Cell-lineage tracing revealed PLC enrichment is secondary to Insr and Igf1r deletion in differentiated adult LCs, suggesting a feedback mechanism between cells at different steps of differentiation.

We report that matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) expression/activity are increased in bones from mice with genetic constitutive activation (ca) of the PTH receptor 1 (PTH1R) in Ots (caPTH1ROt) and in bones from mice exposed to elevated PTH levels but not in mice lacking [conditional knockout (cKO)] the PTH1R in Ots (cKOPTH1ROt). Furthermore, PTH upregulates MMP14 in human bone cultures and in Ot-enriched bones from floxed control mice but not from cKOPTH1ROt mice. MMP14 activity increases soluble receptor activator of NF-κΒ ligand production, which in turn, stimulates osteoclast differentiation and resorption. Pharmacologic inhibition of MMP14 activity reduced the high bone remodeling exhibited by caPTH1ROt mice or induced by chronic PTH elevation and decreased bone resorption but allowed full stimulation of bone formation induced by PTH injections, thereby potentiating bone gain. Thus, MMP14 is a new member of the intricate gene network activated in Ots by PTH1R signaling that can be targeted to adjust the skeletal responses to PTH in favor of bone preservation.-Delgado-Calle, J., Hancock, B., Likine, E.

https://openalex.org/W2782893956,"Prenatal iron deficiency alters fetal developmental trajectories, which results in persistent changes in organ function. Here, we studied the effects of prenatal iron deficiency on fetal kidney and liver mitochondrial function. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed partially or fully iron-restricted diets to induce a state of moderate or severe iron deficiency alongside iron-replete control rats. We assessed mitochondrial function via high-resolution respirometry and reactive oxygen species generation via fluorescence microscopy on gestational d 21. Hemoglobin levels were reduced in dams in the moderate (−31%) and severe groups (−54%) compared with controls, which was accompanied by 55% reductions in fetal hemoglobin levels in both moderate and severe groups versus controls. Male iron-deficient kidneys exhibited globally reduced mitochondrial content and respiration, as well as increased cytosolic superoxide and decreased NO. Female iron-deficient kidneys exhibited complex II down-regulation and increased mitochondrial oxidative stress. Male iron-deficient livers exhibited reduced complex IV respiration and increased cytosolic superoxide, whereas female liver tissues exhibited no alteration in oxidant levels or mitochondrial function. These findings indicate that prenatal iron deficiency causes changes in mitochondrial content and function as well as oxidant status in a sex- and organ-dependent manner, which may be an important mechanism that underlies the programming of cardiovascular disease.—Woodman, A.

https://openalex.org/W2785171429,"REV-ERBs (REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ) are transcription repressors and circadian regulators. Previous investigations have shown that REV-ERBs repress the expression of target genes, including MMP9 and CX3CR1, in macrophages. Because MMP9 and CX3CR1 reportedly participate in receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis, we inferred that REV-ERBs might play a role in osteoclastogenesis. In the present study, we found that the REV-ERBα level decreased significantly during RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation from primary bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMMs). REV-ERBα knockdown by small interfering RNA in BMMs resulted in the enhanced formation of osteoclasts, whereas REV-ERBβ knockdown showed no effect on osteoclast differentiation. Moreover, the REV-ERB agonist SR9009 inhibited osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Intraperitoneal SR9009 administration prevented ovariectomy-induced bone loss; this effect was accompanied by decreased serum RANKL and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen levels and increased osteoprotegerin levels. Further investigation revealed that NF-κB and MAPK activation and nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1, and c-fos expression were suppressed by SR9009. The level of reactive oxygen species was also decreased by SR9009, with NADPH oxidase subunits also being down-regulated. In addition, an expression microarray showed that FABP4, an intracellular lipid-binding protein, was up-regulated by REV-ERB agonism. BMS309403, an inhibitor of FABP4, partially prevented the suppression of osteoclastogenesis by SR9009 through stabilizing phosphorylation of p65. To summarize, our results proved that the REV-ERB agonism inhibited osteoclastogenesis partially via FABP4 up-regulation.—Song, C., Tan, P., Zhang, Z., Wu, W., Dong, Y., Zhao, L., Liu, H., Guan, H., Li, F.

https://openalex.org/W2791505013,"Systemic corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment for various hearing disorders for more than 30 yr. Accordingly, numerous studies have described glucocorticoids (GCs) and stressors to be protective in the auditory organ against damage associated with a variety of health conditions, including noise exposure. Conversely, stressors are also predictive risk factors for hearing disorders. How both of these contrasting stress actions are linked has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that higher corticosterone levels during acoustic trauma in female rats is highly correlated with a decline of auditory fiber responses in high-frequency cochlear regions, and that hearing thresholds and the outer hair cell functions (distortion products of otoacoustic emissions) are left unaffected. Moreover, when GC receptor (GR) or mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation was antagonized by mifepristone or spironolactone, respectively, GR, but not MR, inhibition significantly and permanently attenuated trauma-induced effects on auditory fiber responses, including inner hair cell ribbon loss and related reductions of early and late auditory brainstem responses. These findings strongly imply that higher corticosterone stress levels profoundly impair auditory nerve processing, which may influence central auditory acuity. These changes are likely GR mediated as they are prevented by mifepristone.—Singer, W., Kasini, K., Manthey, M., Eckert, P., Armbruster, P., Vogt, M.

https://openalex.org/W2792395165,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) plays important roles in cardiovascular development and immunity. S1P is abundant in plasma because erythrocytes—the major source of S1P—lack any S1P-degrading activity; however, much remains unclear about the source of the plasma S1P precursor, sphingosine (SPH), derived mainly from the hydrolysis of ceramides by the action of ceramidases that are encoded by 5 distinct genes, acid ceramidase 1 (ASAH1)/Asah1, ASAH2/Asah2, alkaline ceramidase 1 (ACER1)/Acer1, ACER2/Acer2, and ACER3/Acer3, in humans/mice. Previous studies have reported that knocking out Asah1 or Asah2 failed to reduce plasma SPH and S1P levels in mice. In this study, we show that knocking out Acer1 or Acer3 also failed to reduce the blood levels of SPH or S1P in mice. In contrast, knocking out Acer2 from either whole-body or the hematopoietic lineage markedly decreased the blood levels of SPH and S1P in mice. Of interest, knocking out Acer2 from whole-body or the hematopoietic lineage also markedly decreased the levels of dihydrosphingosine (dhSPH) and dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate (dhS1P) in blood. Taken together, these results suggest that ACER2 plays a key role in the maintenance of high plasma levels of sphingoid base-1-phosphates—S1P and dhS1P—by controlling the generation of sphingoid bases—SPH and dhSPH—in hematopoietic cells.—Li, F., Xu, R., Low, B.

https://openalex.org/W2794147452,"Prostaglandin (PG)E2 is an arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediator that plays an important role in inflammation and immunity. In this study, we demonstrate that PGE2 suppresses basal and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (VD3)-induced expression of hCAP18/LL-37 via E prostanoid (EP)2 and EP4 receptors. In humans, VD3 up-regulates vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression and promotes transcription of the cathelicidin hCAP18/LL-37 gene, whereas PGE2 counteracts this effect. We find that PGE2 induces the cAMP/PKA-signaling pathway and enhances the expression of the inhibitory transcription factor cAMP-responsive modulator/inducible cAMP early repressor, which prevents VDR expression and induction of hCAP18/LL-37 in human macrophages. The negative regulation by PGE2 was evident in M1- and M2-polarized human macrophages, although PGE2 displayed more profound inhibitory effects in M2 cells. PGE2 impaired VD3-induced expression of cathelicidin and concomitant activation of autophagy during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and facilitated intracellular Mtb growth in human macrophages. An EP4 agonist also significantly promoted Mtb survival in human macrophages. Our results indicate that PGE2 inhibits hCAP18/LL-37 expression, especially VD3-induced cathelicidin and autophagy, which may reduce host defense against Mtb. Accordingly, antagonists of EP4 may constitute a novel adjunctive therapy in Mtb infection.—Wan, M., Tang, X., Rekha, R. S., Muvva, S. S. V. J. R., Brighenti, S., Agerberth, B., Haeggstro¨m, J. Z.

HBc can function as an oncogene arising from its gene regulatory properties, but how it contributes functionally to hepatocarcinogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we determined the molecular and functional roles of HBc during HBV-associated hepatocellular tumorigenesis. HBc increased tumor formation of hepatoma cells. Moreover, expression of HBc specifically promoted proliferation of hepatoma cells in vitro. Mechanistic investigations revealed that these effects were caused by activation of the Src/PI3K/Akt pathway through proximal switch from inactive Src to the active form of the kinase by HBc. HBc-mediated sarcoma (Src) kinase activation was associated with down-regulation of C-terminal Src kinase (Csk). In addition, HBc enhances Src expression by activation of alternative Src 1A promoter in an Sp1 transcription factor-dependent manner. Proliferation induced by stable HBc expression was associated with increased G1-S cell cycle progression mediated by Src kinase activation. HBc-induced cellular proliferation and tumor formation were reversed by administration of the Src inhibitor saracatinib. Together, our findings suggest that HBc promotes tumorigenesis of hepatoma cells by enhancing the expression of total Src and the active form of the kinase and subsequently activates Src/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, revealing novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis.-Liu, W., Guo, T.-F., Jing, Z.-T., Yang, Z., Liu, L., Yang, Y.-P., Lin, X., Tong, Q.-Y.

https://openalex.org/W2785173995,"Sepsis—leading to septic shock—is the leading cause of death in intensive care units. The systemic inflammatory response to infection, which is initiated by activated myeloid cells, plays a key role in the lethal outcome. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an upstream immunoregulatory mediator, released by myeloid cells, that underlies a common genetic susceptibility to different infections and septic shock. Accordingly, strategies that are aimed at inhibiting the action of MIF have therapeutic potential. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of tailorable, small, affinity-matured nanobodies (Nbs; single-domain antigen-binding fragments derived from camelid heavy-chain Abs) directed against MIF. Of importance, these bioengineered Nbs bind both human and mouse MIFs with nanomolar affinity. NbE5 and NbE10 inhibit key MIF functions that can exacerbate septic shock, such as the tautomerase activity of MIF (by blocking catalytic pocket residues that are critical for MIF's conformation and receptor binding), the TNF-inducing potential, and the ability of MIF to antagonize glucocorticoid action. A lead NbE10, tailored to be a multivalent, half-life extended construct (NbE10-NbAlb8-NbE10), attenuated lethality in murine endotoxemia when administered via single injection, either prophylactically or therapeutically. Hence, Nbs, with their structural and pharmacologic advantages over currently available inhibitors, may be an effective, novel approach to interfere with the action of MIF in septic shock and other conditions of inflammatory endorgan damage.—Sparkes, A., De Baetselier, P., Brys, L., Cabrito, I., Sterckx, Y.

However, recent work has also implicated FGF21 in cellular stress response under pathogenic conditions. The role and regulation of FGF21 in AKI are unclear. Here, we show that FGF21 was dramatically induced during cisplatin treatment of renal tubular cells in vitro and mouse kidneys in vivo. The inductive response was suppressed by pifithrin (a pharmacological inhibitor of P53), suggesting a role of P53 in FGF21 induction. In cultured renal tubular cells, knockdown of FGF21 aggravated cisplatin-induced apoptosis, whereas supplementation of recombinant FGF21 was protective. Consistently, recombinant FGF21 alleviated cisplatin-induced kidney dysfunction, tissue damage, and tubular apoptosis in mice. Mechanistically, FGF21 suppressed P53 induction and activation during cisplatin treatment. Together, these results indicate that FGF21 is induced during cisplatin nephrotoxicity to protect renal tubules, and recombinant FGF21 may have therapeutic potential.-Li, F., Liu, Z., Tang, C., Cai, J., Dong, Z.

The role of Thy1 on bone structure and function has been poorly studied and represents a major knowledge gap. Therefore, we analyzed the long bones of wild-type (WT) and Thy1 knockout (KO) mice with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histomorphometry to compare changes in bone architecture and overall bone structure. micro-CT analysis of long bones revealed Thy1 KO and WT mice fed a high-fat diet demonstrated bone structural parameters at 4 mo that differed significantly between WT and KO mice. A significant reduction in trabecular bone volume was noted in Thy1 KO mice. The most prominent differences were observed in trabecular bone volume ratio and trabecular bone connectivity density. Consistent with micro-CT measurements, histomorphometric analysis also showed decreased bone volume in the obese Thy1 KO mice compared to obese WT mice. In vitro assays revealed that osteogenic conditions increased Thy1 expression during OB differentiation and absence of Thy1 attenuated osteoblastogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2785298742,"Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience chronic or recurrent bacterial and fungal lung infections. Many patients with CF cannot effectively clear Aspergillus from their lungs. This may result in IgE sensitization and the development of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or invasive infections, such as Aspergillus bronchitis. Lung disease in patients with CF is associated with neutrophil-dominated inflammation and elevated levels of the serine protease, neutrophil elastase (NE). Various C-type lectin-like receptors (CLRs), including Dectin-1 and Dectin-2, are involved in the immune response to Aspergillus. Here, we show that purified NE cleaves Dectin-1 in an isoform-specific manner. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with CF, which contains high NE activity, induces Dectin-1 cleavage. Similarly, filtrate from a protease-producing strain of Aspergillus fumigatus induces isoform-specific cleavage of Dectin-1. Dectin-1 knockout (KO) cells and NE-treated cells demonstrated reduced phagocytosis of zymosan, a fungal cell wall preparation. In addition, NE cleaves 2 other CLRs, Dectin-2 and Mincle, and fungal-induced cytokine production was reduced in Dectin-1 KO cells, Dectin-2 KO cells, and NE-treated cells. Thus, Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 cleavage by NE and/or A.fumigatus–derived proteases results in an aberrant antifungal immune response that likely contributes to disease pathology in patients with CF.—Griffiths J.

https://openalex.org/W2784345014,"White adipose tissue inflammation is linked with increased aromatase gene expression and estrogen production, a major risk factor for breast cancer in obese postmenopausal women. TNF-α, a proinflammatory cytokine, is a key driver of aromatase promoter I.4-mediated expression in adipose tissue. In this study, we have shown that IL-10, an anti–inflammatory cytokine, suppressed both TNF-α-stimulated human aromatase reporter-luciferase (hARO-Luc) expression in mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells and aromatase gene expression in human breast adipose stromal cells (ASCs). IL-10 blocked TNF-α-stimulated ERK1/2 activation in ASCs, suggesting an inhibitory effect through the MAPK signaling pathway. The links among obesity, IL-10, and aromatase were confirmed in ovariectomized (OVX) hARO-Luc mice, where increased adiposity was associated with upregulation of aromatase reporter activity and reduced IL-10 level in the mammary fat pad. OVX mice also exhibited changes in gut microbiota, similar to that in obese women, indicating altered immune function. In summary, our results suggest that increased adiposity, induced by the lack of ovarian hormones, results in enhanced expression of aromatase in mammary adipose tissue, mediated by reduction in local IL-10. These findings may bring new insights into the mechanisms involved in the development of postmenopausal breast cancer, as well as novel approaches for prevention.—Martínez-Chacón G., Brown, K.

We used a combination of structural, biochemical, biophysical, and cell-based approaches to decipher the specificity of the interaction between mucin glycans and mammalian lectins expressed in the gut, including galectin (Gal)-3 and C-type lectin receptors. Gal-3 differentially recognized intestinal mucins with different O-glycosylation profiles, as determined by mass spectrometry (MS). Modification of mucin glycosylation, via chemical treatment leading to a loss of terminal glycans, promoted the interaction of Gal-3 to poly-N-acetyllactosamine. Specific interactions were observed between mucins and mouse dendritic cell-associated lectin (mDectin)-2 or specific intercellular adhesion molecule–grabbing nonintegrin-related-1 (SIGN-R1), but not mDectin-1, using a cell-reporter assay, as also confirmed by atomic force spectroscopy. We characterized the N-glycosylation profile of mouse colonic mucin (Muc)-2 by MS and showed that the interaction with mDectin-2 was mediated by high-mannose N-glycans. Furthermore, we observed Gal-3 binding to the 3 C-type lectins by force spectroscopy. We showed that mDectin-1, mDectin-2, and SIGN-R1 are decorated by N-glycan structures that can be recognized by the carbohydrate recognition domain of Gal-3.

In the lipid-free state, the apolipoprotein amphipathic a-helices interact intra- and intermolecularly, providing structural stabilization by self-association. We have reported that lipid-free apoA-I becomes amyloidogenic upon physiologically relevant (myeloperoxidase-mediated) Met oxidation. In this study, we established that Met oxidation promotes amyloidogenesis by reducing the stability of apoA-I monomers and irreversibly disrupting selfassociation. The oxidized apoA-I monomers also exhibited increased cellular cholesterol release capacity and stronger association with macrophages, compared to nonoxidized apoA-I. Of physiologic relevance, preformed oxidized apoA-I amyloid fibrils induced amyloid formation in nonoxidized apoA-I. This process was enhanced when self-association of nonoxidized apoA-I was disrupted by thermal treatment. Solid state NMR analysis revealed that aggregates formed by seeded nonoxidized apoA-I were structurally similar to those formed by the oxidized protein, featuring a β-structure-rich amyloid fold alongside a-helices retained from the native state. In atherosclerotic lesions, the conditions that promote apoA-I amyloid formation are readily available: myeloperoxidase, active oxygen species, low pH, and high concentration of lipid-free apoA-I.

Prolactin (PRL) is present in high quantities in maternal milk; however, the effects of milk PRL on the offspring remain poorly characterized. In this study, we evaluated whether feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) to rats during lactation alters PRL, both in the mother's serum and in milk, and whether this factor contributes to HFD-induced metabolic dysfunction in the offspring. Maternal HFD resulted in decreased PRL levels in milk (but not in serum), reduced mammary gland (MG) PRL receptor expression, and altered MG structure and function. Offspring from HFD-fed dams had increased body weight and adiposity, and developed fatty liver, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance at weaning. Increasing PRL levels in the HFD-fed mothers by subcutaneous osmotic minipumps releasing PRL normalized MG function and PRL levels in milk. Moreover, PRL treatment in HFD-fed mothers, or directly in their pups via oral PRL administration, increased liver STAT5 phosphorylation, reduced visceral adiposity, ameliorated fatty liver, and improved insulin sensitivity in offspring.

In this study, we sought to determine whether Brca1 is necessary for metabolic regulation of skeletal muscle using a novel in vivo mouse model. We developed an inducible skeletal muscle-specific Brca1knockout (BRCA1KOsmi) model to test whether Brca1 expression is necessary for maintenance of metabolic function of skeletal muscle when exposed to a high-fat diet (HFD). Our data demonstrated that deletion of Brca1 prevented HFD-induced alterations in glucose and insulin tolerance. Irrespective of diet, BRCA1KOsmi mice exhibited significantly lower ADP-stimulated complex I mitochondrial respiration rates compared to age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. The data show that Brca1 has the ability to localize to the mitochondria in skeletal muscle and that BRCA1KOsmi mice exhibit higher whole-body CO2 production, respiratory exchange ratio, and energy expenditure, compared with the WT mice. Our results demonstrate that loss of Brca1 in skeletal muscle leads to dysregulated metabolic function, characterized by decreased mitochondrial respiration. Thus, any condition that results in loss of Brca1 function could induce metabolic imbalance in skeletal muscle.-Jackson, K. C., Tarpey, M. D., Valencia, A. P., Iñigo, M. R., Pratt, S.

Control (TXNIPfl/fl) and TXNIPfl/fl cdh5cre mice were fed a high protein–low carbohydrate (HP-LC) diet for 3 mo to induce metabolic stress. We found that TXNIPfl/fl and TXNIPfl/fl cdh5cre mice on an HP-LC diet displayed impaired glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia concretizing the metabolic stress induced. We evaluated the impact of this metabolic stress on mice with reduced endothelial TXNIP expression with regard to arterial structure and function. TXNIPfl/fl cdh5cre mice on an HP-LC diet exhibited less endothelial dysfunction than littermate mice on an HP-LC diet. These mice were protected from decreased aortic medial cell content, impaired aortic distensibility, and increased plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 secretion. This protective effect came with lower oxidative stress and lower inflammation, with a reduced NLRP3 inflammasome expression, leading to a decrease in cleaved IL-1β.

We have studied CaM in Chlamydomonas, a widely used organism for ciliary studies. CaM is present in the cell body and the flagellum, with enrichment in the basal body region. Loss of CaM causes shortening of the nucleus basal body connector and impairs flagellar motility and assembly but not flagellar disassembly. Moreover, the cam mutant is defective in pH shock-induced deflagellation. The mutant deflagellates, however, upon mechanical shearing and treatment with mastoparan or detergent undergo permeabilization in the presence of calcium, indicating the cam mutant is defective in elevations of cytosolic calcium induced by pH shock, rather than by the deflagellation machinery. Indeed, the cam mutant fails to produce inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate. Biochemical and genetic analysis showed that CaM does not directly activate PLC.

Biochemical and structural analysis by Raman and circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that the charge distribution on the protein's surface mediates the structural balance between stability for thermal adaptation and flexibility for counteracting the salt-induced rigid and nonfunctional hydrophobic packing. Salt bridge interactions via increased negative and positive charges contribute to structural stability. Salt tolerance, conversely, is mediated by a dynamic structure that becomes more fixed and functional with increasing salt concentration.

Overexpressing Cyr61 repressed C3H10T1/2 and primary marrow stromal cells to differentiate into mature adipocytes. Conversely, inhibition of endogenous Cyr61 induced C3H10T1/2 and primary marrow stromal cells to fully differentiate. Mechanism investigations reveal that knockdown of Cyr61 inhibited the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and decreased nuclear protein levels of β-catenin and transcription factor 7-like 2. Moreover, the silencing of Cyr61 increased protein levels of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1, mammalian target of rapamycin, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, and ribosomal protein S6-the major components of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling-in C3H10T1/2 cells. Additional investigations demonstrated that treatment with rapamycin significantly attenuated adipocyte formation that was induced by Cyr61 small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection. Moreover, Cyr61 siRNA also lost its ability to stimulate adipocyte formation under the background of β-catenin overexpression. Taken together, our study provides evidence that CYR61 regulates adipocyte differentiation via multiple signaling pathways that involve at least the inactivation of mTORC1 signaling and the activation of canonical Wnt signaling.-Yang, Y., Qi, Q., Wang, Y., Shi, Y., Yang, W., Cen, Y., Zhu, E., Li, X., Chen, D., Wang, B. Cysteine-rich protein 61 regulates adipocyte differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells through mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and canonical Wnt signaling."

The mechanism underlying the origin of pacemaking activity is not well understood. In this study, we created human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells that show pacemaking activity through heterologous expression of strong inward rectifier K+ subfamily 2 isoform 1 (Kir2.1) channels, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated isoform 2 (HCN2) nonselective cation channels, and voltage-gated Na+ subfamily 1 isoform 5 or Ca2+ subfamily 3 isoform 1 (Nav1.5 or Cav3.1) channels. A range of relative levels of Kir2.1 and HCN2 currents dynamically counterbalance, generating spontaneous rhythmic oscillation of resting membrane potential between -64 and -34 mV and determining oscillation rates. Each oscillation cycle begins with an autodepolarization phase, which slowly proceeds to the threshold potential that activates Nav1.5 or Cav3.1 channels and triggers action potential, causing engineered HEK293 cells to exhibit pacemaking activity at a rate of ≤67 beats/min. Engineered HEK293 cells with Kir2.1 and either HCN3 or HCN4 also show the oscillation. Engineered HEK293 cells expressing HCN2 and other Kir2 channels, which lack Kir2.1-like complete inward rectification, do not show the oscillation. Therefore, Kir2.1-like inward rectification-controlled precise and dynamic balances between Kir2 and HCN currents initiate spontaneous rhythmic action potential and form an origin of pacemaking activity; Kir2 and HCN channels play essential roles in pacemaking activity.-Chen, K., Zuo, D., Wang, S.-Y. Chen, H. Kir2 inward rectification-controlled precise and dynamic balances between Kir2 and HCN currents initiate pacemaking activity."
https://openalex.org/W2782772893,"Alcohol acts through numerous pathways leading to alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Cytochrome P450 (CYP2E1), an ethanol-inducible enzyme, metabolizes ethanol-producing toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is regulated at the posttranslational level. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation is a posttranslational modification that involves the addition of SUMOs, which modulate protein stability, activity, and localization. We demonstrated that ubiquitin-conjugation enzyme 9, the SUMO-conjugating enzyme, is induced in the livers of an intragastric ethanol mouse model. Our aim is to examine whether SUMOylation could regulate ethanol-induced CYP2E1 expression in ALD and to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s). CYP2E1 and UBC9 expression in vitro and in vivo was detected by real-time PCR and immunoblotting/immunostaining. SUMOylation was assayed by mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation. Ubc9 expression was induced in ethanol-fed mouse livers, and silencing inhibited ethanol-mediated CYP2E1 microsomal retention and enzymatic activity. CYP2E1 SUMOylation was found to be induced by ethanol in vitro and in vivo. Ubc9 silencing prevents ethanol-induced lipid accumulation and ROS production. UBC9 was highly expressed in human ALD livers. Finally, we found that lysine 410 is a key SUMOylated residue contributing to CYP2E1 protein stability and activity preventing CYP2E1 SUMOylation.

https://openalex.org/W2791860971,"The multiple physiologic characteristics of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) make it a promising drug candidate for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the half-life of GLP-1 is short as a result of degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase IV and renal clearance. Stabilizing GLP-1 is therefore critical for its use in drug development. Self-assembling peptides are a class of peptides that undergo spontaneous assembly into ordered nanostructures. Recently, studies of self-assembling peptides as drug carriers have increased because of their enhanced stability. In the present study, GLP-1 was modified to incorporate the structural characteristics of self-assembling peptides aiming to generate a self-assembling GLP-1 derivative. Receptor binding capacity and insulinotropic effects were measured to investigate the physiologic functions of GLP-1, along with morphologic approaches to observe supramolecular formation on self-assembly at the nano scale. Finally, blood glucose regulation and body weight were monitored after administration of selected derivatives. Our findings revealed that cadyglp1e and cadyglp1m both exhibited improved stability even though different nanoshapes were observed for these two self-assembling peptides. Both cadyglp1e and cadyglp1m retained glucoregulatory activity after insulin stimulation and were potent drug candidates for long-acting GLP-1 derivatives to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our findings support the feasibility of introducing self-assembly functions into peptides with poor stabilities, such as GLP-1.—Li, Y., Cui, T., Kong, X., Yi, X., Kong, D., Zhang, J., Liu, C., Gong, M.

https://openalex.org/W2783406572,"High-density lipoproteins augment hypoxia-induced angiogenesis by inducing the key angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and total protein levels of its receptor 2 (VEGFR2). The activation/phosphorylation of VEGFR2 is critical for mediating downstream, angiogenic signaling events. This study aimed to determine whether reconstituted high-density lipoprotein (rHDL) activates VEGFR2 phosphorylation and the downstream signaling events and the importance of VEGFR2 in the proangiogenic effects of rHDL in hypoxia. In vitro, rHDL increased VEGFR2 activation and enhanced phosphorylation of downstream, angiogenic signaling proteins ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in hypoxia. Incubation with a VEGFR2-neutralizing antibody attenuated rHDL-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR2, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and tubule formation. In a murine model of ischemia-driven neovascularization, rHDL infusions enhanced blood perfusion and augmented capillary and arteriolar density. Infusion of a VEGFR2-neutralizing antibody ablated those proangiogenic effects of rHDL. Circulating Sca1+/CXCR4+ angiogenic progenitor cell levels, important for neovascularization in response to ischemia, were higher in rHDL-infused mice 3 d after ischemic induction, but that did not occur in mice that also received the VEGFR2-neutralizing antibody. In summary, VEGFR2 has a key role in the proangiogenic effects of rHDL in hypoxia/ischemia. These findings have therapeutic implications for angiogenic diseases associated with an impaired response to tissue ischemia.-Cannizzo, C. M., Adonopulos, A. A., Solly, E.

https://openalex.org/W2785013581,"IL-1 signaling is adhesion-restricted in many cell types, but the mechanism that drives it is not defined. We screened for proteins recruited to nascent adhesions in IL-1–treated human fibroblasts with tandem mass tag–mass spectrometry. We used fibronectin bead preparations to enrich 10 actin-associated proteins. There was a 1.2 times log 2-fold enrichment of actin capping protein (ACP) at 30 min after IL-1 stimulation. Knockdown (KD) of ACP by siRNA reduced IL-1–induced ERK activation(by 56%, matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) expression by 48%, and MMP-9 expression by 62% (in all reductions, P <0.01). Confocal or structured illumination microscopy showed that ACP was diffused throughout the cytosol but strongly accumulated at the ruffled border of spreading cells. ACP colocalized with nascent paxillin- and vinculin-containing adhesions at the ruffled border, but not with mature adhesions in the center. ACP KD promoted the formation of large, stable adhesions. Immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation analysis showed that ACP was associated with the IL-1 signal transduction proteins myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and IL-1 receptor–associated kinase (IRAK) at the ruffled border of the leading edge. IL-1–induced phospho-ERK and MyD88 or IRAK colocalized at the leading edge. We concluded that ACP is required for recruitment and function of IL-1 signaling complexes in nascent adhesions at the leading edge of the cell.—Wang, Q., Delcorde, J., Tang, T., Downey, G.

https://openalex.org/W2784969173,"No clinically approved therapies are currently available that prevent the onset of photoreceptor death in retinal degeneration. Signaling between retinal neurons is regulatedby the release and uptake of neurotransmitters, wherein GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. In this work, novel 3-chloropropiophenone derivatives and the clinical anticonvulsants tiagabine and vigabatrin were tested to modulate GABA signaling and protect against light-induced retinal degeneration. Abca4−/− Rdh8−/− mice, an accelerated model of retinal degeneration, were exposed to intense light after prophylactic injections of one of these compounds. Imaging and functional assessments of the retina indicated that these compounds successfully protected photoreceptor cells from degeneration to maintain a full-visual-field response. Furthermore, these compounds demonstrated a strong safety profile in wild-type mice and did not compromise visual function or damage the retina, despite repeated administration. These results indicate that modulating inhibitory GABA signaling can offer prophylactic protection against light-induced retinal degeneration.—Schur, R.

https://openalex.org/W2783223394,"We have recently identified a cholinergic chemosensory cell in the urethral epithelium, urethral brush cell (UBC), that, upon stimulation with bitter or bacterial substances, initiates a reflex detrusor activation. Here, we elucidated cholinergic mechanisms that modulate UBC responsiveness. We analyzed muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1–5 mAChR) expression by using RT-PCR in UBCs, recorded [Ca2+]i responses to a bitter stimulus in isolated UBCs of wild-type and mAChR-deficient mice, and performed cystometry in all involved strains. The bitter response of UBCs was enhanced by global cholinergic and selective M2 inhibition, diminished by positive allosteric modulation of M5, and unaffected by M1, M3, and M4 mAChR inhibitors. This effect was not observed in M2 and M5 mAChR-deficient mice. In cystometry, M5 mAChR-deficient mice demonstrated signs of detrusor overactivity. In conclusion, M2 and M5 mAChRs attenuate the bitter response of UBC via a cholinergic negative autocrine feedback mechanism. Cystometry suggests that dysfunction, particularly of the M5 receptor, may lead to such symptoms as bladder overactivity.—Deckmann, K., Rafiq, A., Erdmann, C., Illig, C., Durschnabel, M., Wess, J., Weidner, W., Bschleipfer, T., Kummer, W.

https://openalex.org/W2787658511,"Amyloid fibrils are filamentous protein aggregates associated with the pathogenesis of a wide variety of human diseases. The formation of such aggregates typically follows nucleation-dependent kinetics, wherein the assembly and structural conversion of amyloidogenic proteins into oligomeric aggregates (nuclei) is the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction. In this study, we sought to gain structural insights into the oligomeric nuclei of the human prion protein (PrP) by preparing a series of deletion mutants lacking 14-44 of the C-terminal 107 residues of PrP and examined the kinetics and thermodynamics of these mutants in amyloid formation. An analysis of the experimental data using the concepts of the Φ-value analysis indicated that the helix 2 region (residues 168-196) acquires an amyloid-like β-sheet during nucleation, whereas the other regions preserves a relatively disordered structure in the nuclei. This finding suggests that the helix 2 region serves as the nucleation site for the assembly of amyloid fibrils.-Honda, R., Kuwata, K.

https://openalex.org/W2791890831,"Bombesin receptor subtype 3 (BRS-3) is a GPCR that is expressed in the CNS, peripheral tissues, and tumors. Our understanding of BRS-3's role in physiology and pathophysiology is limited because its natural ligand is unknown. In an attempt to identify this ligand, we screened toad skin ( Bufo bufo gargarizans Cantor) extracts and identified prostaglandins as putative ligands. In BRS-3-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, we found that prostaglandins, with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) being the most potent, fulfill the pharmacologic criteria of affinity, selectivity, and specificity to be considered as agonists to the BRS-3 receptor. However, PGE2 is unable to activate BRS-3 in different cellular environments. We speculated that EP receptors might be the cause of this cellular selectivity, and we found that EP3 is the receptor primarily responsible for the differential PGE2 effect. Consequently, we reconstituted the HEK environment in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and found that BRS-3 and EP3 interact to potentiate PGE2 signaling. This potentiating effect is receptor specific, and it occurs only when BRS-3 is paired to EP3. Our study represents an example of functional crosstalk between two distantly related GPCRs and may be of clinical importance for BRS-3-targeted therapies.-Zhang, Y., Liu, Y., Wu, L., Fan, C., Wang, Z., Zhang, X., Alachkar, A., Liang, X., Civelli, O.
