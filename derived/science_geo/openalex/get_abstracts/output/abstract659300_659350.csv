https://openalex.org/W3084261954,"Increased efforts are required to prevent further losses to terrestrial biodiversity and the ecosystem services that it provides1,2. Ambitious targets have been proposed, such as reversing the declining trends in biodiversity3; however, just feeding the growing human population will make this a challenge4. Here we use an ensemble of land-use and biodiversity models to assess whether—and how—humanity can reverse the declines in terrestrial biodiversity caused by habitat conversion, which is a major threat to biodiversity5. We show that immediate efforts, consistent with the broader sustainability agenda but of unprecedented ambition and coordination, could enable the provision of food for the growing human population while reversing the global terrestrial biodiversity trends caused by habitat conversion. If we decide to increase the extent of land under conservation management, restore degraded land and generalize landscape-level conservation planning, biodiversity trends from habitat conversion could become positive by the mid-twenty-first century on average across models (confidence interval, 2042–2061), but this was not the case for all models. Food prices could increase and, on average across models, almost half (confidence interval, 34–50%) of the future biodiversity losses could not be avoided. However, additionally tackling the drivers of land-use change could avoid conflict with affordable food provision and reduces the environmental effects of the food-provision system. Through further sustainable intensification and trade, reduced food waste and more plant-based human diets, more than two thirds of future biodiversity losses are avoided and the biodiversity trends from habitat conversion are reversed by 2050 for almost all of the models. Although limiting further loss will remain challenging in several biodiversity-rich regions, and other threats—such as climate change—must be addressed to truly reverse the declines in biodiversity, our results show that ambitious conservation efforts and food system transformation are central to an effective post-2020 biodiversity strategy. To promote the recovery of the currently declining global trends in terrestrial biodiversity, increases in both the extent of land under conservation management and the sustainability of the global food system from farm to fork are required."
https://openalex.org/W3083770449,"The DNA sensor cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) initiates innate immune responses following microbial infection, cellular stress and cancer1. Upon activation by double-stranded DNA, cytosolic cGAS produces 2′3′ cGMP–AMP, which triggers the induction of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons 2–7. cGAS is also present inside the cell nucleus, which is replete with genomic DNA8, where chromatin has been implicated in restricting its enzymatic activity9. However, the structural basis for inhibition of cGAS by chromatin remains unknown. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human cGAS bound to nucleosomes. cGAS makes extensive contacts with both the acidic patch of the histone H2A–H2B heterodimer and nucleosomal DNA. The structural and complementary biochemical analysis also find cGAS engaged to a second nucleosome in trans. Mechanistically, binding of the nucleosome locks cGAS into a monomeric state, in which steric hindrance suppresses spurious activation by genomic DNA. We find that mutations to the cGAS–acidic patch interface are sufficient to abolish the inhibitory effect of nucleosomes in vitro and to unleash the activity of cGAS on genomic DNA in living cells. Our work uncovers the structural basis of the interaction between cGAS and chromatin and details a mechanism that permits self–non-self discrimination of genomic DNA by cGAS. Using cryo-electron microscopy, the authors determine the structure of cGAS bound to nucleosomes and present evidence for the mechanism by which nucleosome binding to cGAS prevents cGAS dimerization and its binding to free double-stranded DNA."

This adaptability is lost in cultured adult endothelial cells, which do not vascularize tissues in an organotypic manner. Here, we show that transient reactivation of the embryonic-restricted ETS variant transcription factor 2 (ETV2)3 in mature human endothelial cells cultured in a serum-free three-dimensional matrix composed of a mixture of laminin, entactin and type-IV collagen (LEC matrix) 'resets' these endothelial cells to adaptable, vasculogenic cells, which form perfusable and plastic vascular plexi. Through chromatin remodelling, ETV2 induces tubulogenic pathways, including the activation of RAP1, which promotes the formation of durable lumens4,5. In three-dimensional matrices-which do not have the constraints of bioprinted scaffolds-the 'reset' vascular endothelial cells (R-VECs) self-assemble into stable, multilayered and branching vascular networks within scalable microfluidic chambers, which are capable of transporting human blood. In vivo, R-VECs implanted subcutaneously in mice self-organize into durable pericyte-coated vessels that functionally anastomose to the host circulation and exhibit long-lasting patterning, with no evidence of malformations or angiomas. R-VECs directly interact with cells within three-dimensional co-cultured organoids, removing the need for the restrictive synthetic semipermeable membranes that are required for organ-on-chip systems, therefore providing a physiological platform for vascularization, which we call 'Organ-On-VascularNet'. R-VECs enable perfusion of glucose-responsive insulin-secreting human pancreatic islets, vascularize decellularized rat intestines and arborize healthy or cancerous human colon organoids. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and epigenetic profiling, we demonstrate that R-VECs establish an adaptive vascular niche that differentially adjusts and conforms to organoids and tumoroids in a tissue-specific manner. Our Organ-On-VascularNet model will permit metabolic, immunological and physiochemical studies and screens to decipher the crosstalk between organotypic endothelial cells and parenchymal cells for identification of determinants of endothelial cell heterogeneity, and could lead to advances in therapeutic organ repair and tumour targeting."

https://openalex.org/W3083971280,"Nucleic acids derived from pathogens induce potent innate immune responses1-6. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a double-stranded DNA sensor that catalyses the synthesis of the cyclic dinucleotide cyclic GMP-AMP, which mediates the induction of type I interferons through the STING-TBK1-IRF3 signalling axis7-11. cGAS was previously thought to not react with self DNA owing to its cytosolic localization2,12,13; however, recent studies have shown that cGAS is localized mostly in the nucleus and has low activity as a result of tight nuclear tethering14-18. Here we show that cGAS binds to nucleosomes with nanomolar affinity and that nucleosome binding potently inhibits its catalytic activity. To elucidate the molecular basis of cGAS inactivation by nuclear tethering, we determined the structure of mouse cGAS bound to human nucleosome by cryo-electron microscopy. The structure shows that cGAS binds to a negatively charged acidic patch formed by histones H2A and H2B via its second DNA-binding site19. High-affinity nucleosome binding blocks double-stranded DNA binding and maintains cGAS in an inactive conformation. Mutations of cGAS that disrupt nucleosome binding alter cGAS-mediated signalling in cells."
https://openalex.org/W3084175789,"Nuclear compartments have diverse roles in regulating gene expression, yet the molecular forces and components that drive compartment formation remain largely unclear1. The long non-coding RNA Xist establishes an intra-chromosomal compartment by localizing at a high concentration in a territory spatially close to its transcription locus2 and binding diverse proteins3-5 to achieve X-chromosome inactivation (XCI)6,7. The XCI process therefore serves as a paradigm for understanding how RNA-mediated recruitment of various proteins induces a functional compartment. The properties of the inactive X (Xi)-compartment are known to change over time, because after initial Xist spreading and transcriptional shutoff a state is reached in which gene silencing remains stable even if Xist is turned off8. Here we show that the Xist RNA-binding proteins PTBP19, MATR310, TDP-4311 and CELF112 assemble on the multivalent E-repeat element of Xist7 and, via self-aggregation and heterotypic protein-protein interactions, form a condensate1 in the Xi. This condensate is required for gene silencing and for the anchoring of Xist to the Xi territory, and can be sustained in the absence of Xist. Notably, these E-repeat-binding proteins become essential coincident with transition to the Xist-independent XCI phase8, indicating that the condensate seeded by the E-repeat underlies the developmental switch from Xist-dependence to Xist-independence. Taken together, our data show that Xist forms the Xi compartment by seeding a heteromeric condensate that consists of ubiquitous RNA-binding proteins, revealing an unanticipated mechanism for heritable gene silencing."
https://openalex.org/W3048104208,"Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer, and has a central role in the initiation and development of breast cancer1,2. The success of poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancers that are deficient in homologous recombination exemplifies the utility of synthetically lethal genetic interactions in the treatment of breast cancers that are driven by genomic instability3. Given that defects in homologous recombination are present in only a subset of breast cancers, there is a need to identify additional driver mechanisms for genomic instability and targeted strategies to exploit these defects in the treatment of cancer. Here we show that centrosome depletion induces synthetic lethality in cancer cells that contain the 17q23 amplicon, a recurrent copy number aberration that defines about 9% of all primary breast cancer tumours and is associated with high levels of genomic instability4-6. Specifically, inhibition of polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) using small molecules leads to centrosome depletion, which triggers mitotic catastrophe in cells that exhibit amplicon-directed overexpression of TRIM37. To explain this effect, we identify TRIM37 as a negative regulator of centrosomal pericentriolar material. In 17q23-amplified cells that lack centrosomes, increased levels of TRIM37 block the formation of foci that comprise pericentriolar material-these foci are structures with a microtubule-nucleating capacity that are required for successful cell division in the absence of centrosomes. Finally, we find that the overexpression of TRIM37 causes genomic instability by delaying centrosome maturation and separation at mitotic entry, and thereby increases the frequency of mitotic errors. Collectively, these findings highlight TRIM37-dependent genomic instability as a putative driver event in 17q23-amplified breast cancer and provide a rationale for the use of centrosome-targeting therapeutic agents in treating these cancers."

Does it also depend on enteric neurons that sense mechanical cues to signal fullness of the digestive tract? Here, we identify a group of piezo-expressing neurons innervating the Drosophila crop (the fly equivalent of the stomach) that monitor crop volume to avoid food overconsumption. These neurons reside in the pars intercerebralis (PI), a neuro-secretory center in the brain involved in homeostatic control, and express insulin-like peptides with well-established roles in regulating food intake and metabolism. Piezo knockdown in these neurons of wild-type flies phenocopies the food overconsumption phenotype of piezo-null mutant flies. Conversely, expression of either fly Piezo or mammalian Piezo1 in these neurons of piezo-null mutants suppresses the overconsumption phenotype. Importantly, Piezo+ neurons at the PI are activated directly by crop distension, thus conveying a rapid satiety signal along the “brain-gut axis” to control feeding.

Importantly, Piezo+ neurons at the PI are activated directly by crop distension, thus conveying a rapid satiety signal along the “brain-gut axis” to control feeding. Food intake is regulated by feedback from both gustatory organs and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (Travers et al., 1987Travers J.B. Travers S.P. Norgren R. Gustatory neural processing in the hindbrain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1987; 10: 595-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Kim et al., 2018Kim K.S. Seeley R.J. Sandoval D.A. Signalling from the periphery to the brain that regulates energy homeostasis.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2018; 19: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Neuronal and humoral signals that encode food palatability control feeding in a temporally and spatially specific manner (Asher and Sassone-Corsi, 2015Asher G. Sassone-Corsi P. Time for food: the intimate interplay between nutrition, metabolism, and the circadian clock.Cell. 2015; 161: 84-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and the satiety signal following food ingestion is thought to be mediated by mechanical stimulation of the GI tract and by peptide release through the chemical effects of food (Williams et al., 2016Williams E.K. Chang R.B. Strochlic D.E. Umans B.D. Lowell B.B. Liberles S.D.

Neurotrophic factor control of satiety and body weight.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although there is increasing understanding of how chemical cues released by the GI tract or the brain confer a sense of satiety and inhibit feeding, far less is known about the role of mechano-sensing in the regulation of food intake. In mammals, parasympathetic innervations of the GI tract via the vagus nerve coordinate the complex interactions along the “brain-gut” axis to regulate multiple physiological functions (Morton et al., 2014Morton G.J. Meek T.H. Schwartz M.W. Neurobiology of food intake in health and disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). For example, vagally mediated feedback is critical to the neural control of food intake (Ahima et al., 1996Ahima R.S. Prabakaran D. Mantzoros C. Qu D. Lowell B. Maratos-Flier E. Flier J.S. Role of leptin in the neuroendocrine response to fasting.Nature. 1996; 382: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar; Hahn et al., 1998Hahn T.M. Breininger J.F. Baskin D.G. Schwartz M.W. Coexpression of Agrp and NPY in fasting-activated hypothalamic neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 271-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Moreover, gastric distention triggers activities of the vagal afferent in a dose-dependent manner (Berthoud et al., 2001Berthoud H.-R. Lynn P.A. Blackshaw L.A. Vagal and spinal mechanosensors in the rat stomach and colon have multiple receptive fields.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp.

Behav. 2004; 82: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of mechanoreceptors in the GI tract to control meal size by monitoring volume or food load. In Drosophila, feeding is also under strict control, albeit with simpler anatomy (Edgecomb et al., 1994Edgecomb R.S. Harth C.E. Schneiderman A.M. Regulation of feeding behavior in adult Drosophila melanogaster varies with feeding regime and nutritional state.J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 197: 215-235PubMed Google Scholar; Pool and Scott, 2014Pool A.H.

Recent advances in the neural regulation of feeding behavior in adult Drosophila.J. Zhejiang Univ. Sci. B. 2019; 20: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The GI tract of the fly is also innervated with abundant descending neurons from the brain, including those releasing neuropeptides (Dus et al., 2015Dus M. Lai J.S. Gunapala K.M. Min S. Tayler T.D. Hergarden A.C. Geraud E. Joseph C.M. Suh G.S.

Kenmoku H. Kurata S. From mouth to anus: functional and structural relevance of enteric neurons in the Drosophila melanogaster gut.Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2015; 67: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Most of the endocrine and neuropeptide systems that are known to control feeding in Drosophila are conserved in mammals (Jourjine, 2017Jourjine N. Hunger and thirst interact to regulate ingestive behavior in flies and mammals.BioEssays. 2017; 39: 1600261Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The digestive tract in the adult fly receives innervation from two major sources: (1) the stomatogastric nervous system (SNS), including the corpus cardiacum and the hypercelebral ganglion, and (2) central neurons located at the pars intercerebralis (PI) of the brain and in the abdominal ganglion of the ventral nerve cord (Nässel et al., 2015Nässel D.R. Liu Y. Luo J. Insulin/IGF signaling and its regulation in Drosophila.Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2015; 221: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the GI tract, most of the regions with muscle valves are innervated, consistent with the notion that regulating peristaltic GI movement is one of the main functions of intestinal neurons (Browning and Travagli, 2014Browning K.N. Travagli R.A. Central nervous system control of gastrointestinal motility and secretion and modulation of gastrointestinal functions.Compr. Physiol. 2014; 4: 1339-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). There is also experimental support for the notion that these neurons control feeding and digestion by coordinating GI tract movement. For instance, HGN1 neurons in the adult ventral nerve cord (VNC) innervate the hindgut to regulate defecation (Cognigni et al., 2011Cognigni P. Bailey A.P. Miguel-Aliaga I. Enteric neurons and systemic signals couple nutritional and reproductive status with intestinal homeostasis.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 92-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A counterpart of those neurons in larvae (RN2 neurons) also regulates defecation (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang W. Yan Z. Li B. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Identification of motor neurons and a mechanosensitive sensory neuron in the defecation circuitry of Drosophila larvae.eLife. 2014; 3: e03293Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although the cell bodies of most fly enteric neurons are not located on the GI tract, they are not necessarily efferent neurons that regulate GI tract movement (Cognigni et al., 2011Cognigni P. Bailey A.P. Miguel-Aliaga I. Enteric neurons and systemic signals couple nutritional and reproductive status with intestinal homeostasis.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 92-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Sensory afferent neurons, especially those carrying mechanical cues, are of importance for the regulation of GI tract movement. Studies in several other insects have demonstrated the existence of stretch receptor neurons along the GI tract that monitor the volume of ingested food (Thomson and Holling, 1974Thomson A.J. Holling C.S. Experimental component analysis of blowfly feeding behaviour.J. Insect Physiol. 1974; 20: 1553-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar; Yano et al., 1986Yano T. Nakashima M. Takashima A. Shiraishi A. The roles of the recurrent nerve and the ventral nerve cord in the feeding response of the blowfly, Phormia regina M.Exp. Biol. 1986; 46: 37-44PubMed Google Scholar). It remains an intriguing open question whether there are stretch receptor neurons in Drosophila and, if so, how these neurons sense stretch. Among the mechanotransduction channels, the Piezo family plays multiple roles in sensory transduction and development (Geng et al., 2017Geng J. Zhao Q. Zhang T. Xiao B.

Parallel mechanosensory pathways direct oviposition decision-making in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2020; 30: 3075-3088.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Mouse Piezo1 is involved in mechanical feedback that is critical for multiple physiological functions, including sensing shear stress of blood flow and regulating red blood cell volume (Cahalan et al., 2015Cahalan S.M. Lukacs V. Ranade S.S. Chien S. Bandell M. Patapoutian A. Piezo1 links mechanical forces to red blood cell volume.eLife. 2015; 4: e07370Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar; Zeng et al., 2018Zeng W.Z.

PIEZOs mediate neuronal sensing of blood pressure and the baroreceptor reflex.Science. 2018; 362: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, Piezo2 is found mainly in the nervous system of mice. Besides its predominant functions in mediating somatosensory touch (Ranade et al., 2014Ranade S.S. Woo S.-H. Dubin A.E. Moshourab R.A. Wetzel C. Petrus M. Mathur J. Bégay V. Coste B. Mainquist J. et al.Piezo2 is the major transducer of mechanical forces for touch sensation in mice.Nature. 2014; 516: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), it also senses airway stretch and coordinates lung inflation (Nonomura et al., 2017Nonomura K. Woo S.H. Chang R.B. Gillich A. Qiu Z. Francisco A.G. Ranade S.S. Liberles S.D. Patapoutian A. Piezo2 senses airway stretch and mediates lung inflation-induced apnoea.Nature. 2017; 541: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether Piezo proteins participate in the acute regulation of food intake in the vagus nerve on the GI tract. Here, we report that Drosophila crop distention induced by food intake delivers a fast and direct satiety signal to the brain to suppress further feeding. This feedback is mediated by a group of Piezo+ brain neuroendocrine neurons that innervate the crop wall. These neurons use Piezo as a sensor and are mechanosensitive. Moreover, they are also capable of releasing insulin-like peptides and other hormones. Our finding reveals how mechanical stimuli mediate fast feeding regulation, which may be coordinated with humoral control. To measure the meal size of an individual fly, we fed the flies with sugar solution until they became unresponsive to further sugar stimulation on the proboscis (MAFE assay) (Pool et al., 2014Pool A.H.

Wild-type flies fasted for 4 h normally consumed 0.133 ± 0.033 μL of 100 mM sucrose solution, resulted in a moderately distended crop (Figures 1B and 1C; Video S1). The meal size was comparable at the two sugar concentrations tested (Figures 1B and S1A), suggesting the existence of a mechanical satiety signal from the crop that is distinct from taste and nutritional cues. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI0ZGNkZmMwMjcyODYyYjM5YmEwZDVlMDg0YmEzM2YxNSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjM4NjcwNDkyfQ.BBUS8JDa75QxVnc1sduqJEUivjwbc-ohMswKlR3oLHBzyCE_govold4ckkUOJ9uepNoNSc0BBg0zlvABHNgsWIQB-msFiPs59gP4Ynfu1Fmkcy9gaYw9kg55Q3PrmdRrYh-HyyPhCmPUJDufRBtYwhNMa4y6MuyQ7_sVJkSkAXuAopFFIhd1zjlBYDVveZh_9YoLpxXWf0r51c12lurZQ8aZtxL1ebQSi2v8Tbn4AHk5pz4GX5ox9yW0rZKXxGeOH37mYfzCb9IFXkAUkc-JTKUUfuSz2Lmf2gdoEmsFC7zsLnXnRMJvNAi32AmCAODqyHDGw_kYOV2VTpScC1blgw Download .mp4 (1.95 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. A Wild-Type (w1118) Fly Fed on 100 mM Sucrose To investigate the molecular basis for this mechanical signal of satiety, we measured the meal size of mutants for the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo. Strikingly, the piezo mutant (piezoKO) flies consumed much more (0.374 ± 0.035 μL) than the control group (Figures 1B and 1C), leading to a noticeably bloated crop (Figure S1D) and abdomen (Figure 1C; Video S2). In the most severe cases, the mutant flies consumed so much that they exploded, reminiscent of the scene in the Monty Python film The Meaning of Life in which a person’s stomach explodes because of gross overeating. Freely moving piezoKO flies also consumed significantly more food compared with wild-type flies (Figure S1C). The over-feeding behavior of piezoKO is independent of the sweet taste of sugar, as they also drank more water than control flies after being desiccated for 4 h (Figure S1A; Videos S3 and S4). Nor did the nutritional value of the food affect the phenotype, as the mutant flies consumed noticeably more sweet but calorie-free sugars such as L-glucose (Figure 1D), or nutritious but tasteless chemicals such as sorbitol (Figure 1E), compared with control flies. Furthermore, the amount of food intake is positively correlated with fasting time for both piezo mutant flies and wild-type flies (Figure S1E). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI5MTc3NTc5NzQ2MDljMmIxN2I5YzI2ZTY1NmQ1MjEzMCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjM4NjcwNDkyfQ.LMTBu4CCWx7gMVzIrz_hgo_2caR8-oD25NivDCt3nTKutVpaZuWLV3l-6VsTOnXyfL13D6B4AT225Uv_tzDqH5vJNgqRkT_J1Si3gPCK4SkbAs6DiVsJBNB0BR-Mz7PSvNBnOrS0m_9yW4CHTiNlH8KUPPpmkHwGV7XNZdRCmWy-A7GpRDY0Ni2-131J54M4nieFVYfaBxd2SYmAkrkhGZmbzljGO7iLx3ikQXenWtR_SpFXaFrVH9R75rLVqv3-ll4MHJa-Ozdo7SeY1UzXjrkQrgDdBbvrZOMcpzs462Z9VioNk0ybwSBkpR1hr6vkaTihbL9QEdQykCgABtGLvQ Download .mp4 (3.17 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S2.

A piezoKO Fly Fed on Water To avoid the influence on feeding by manual handling, we used an automatic feeding monitoring system (FlyPAD) (Itskov et al., 2014Itskov P.M. Moreira J.M. Vinnik E. Lopes G. Safarik S. Dickinson M.H. Ribeiro C. Automated monitoring and quantitative analysis of feeding behaviour in Drosophila.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) to quantify the total sip duration of the flies within 20 min. piezoKO flies took more sips than wild-type control flies (Figures 1F and 1G). To establish a link between distention state (size of the crop) and rate of consumption, we monitored the flies’ water drinking sips using FlyPAD. Sip frequency dropped after the first couple of minutes (Figure S1F), indicating a negative correlation between crop size and consumption rate. We also performed experiments in which flies were fasted for 16 h on a piece of Kimwipe soaked with water. piezoKO flies consumed significantly more than wild-type flies in the MAFE assay (Figure S1G) or in the FlyPAD assay (Figure S1H). This result suggests that the overconsumption does not result from thirst. Additionally, the rhythm of midgut contraction was not significantly altered in piezoKO flies (Figures S1J–S1L), suggesting that the overconsumption phenotype of the mutant is not due to an acceleration of gut movement. To validate that the feeding control defect is indeed due to the loss of Piezo function, we used piezo-Gal4 (Kim et al., 2012Kim S.E. Coste B. Chadha A. Cook B. Patapoutian A. The role of Drosophila Piezo in mechanical nociception.Nature. 2012; 483: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) to knock down piezo expression with a piezo RNAi line, leading to an over-feeding phenotype similar to that of piezoKO flies (Figure 1H; Figure S1D). Conversely, overconsumption in piezoKO flies can be rescued by expressing either Drosophila Piezo protein or mammalian Piezo1 protein (Figure 1I), suggesting an evolutionarily conserved function of Piezo proteins. Furthermore, we found that the channel conductivity of the Piezo protein is required for feeding control, as a non-conducting mutation of mPeizo1 (1–2,336) (Coste et al., 2015Coste B. Murthy S.E. Mathur J. Schmidt M. Mechioukhi Y. Delmas P. Patapoutian A. Piezo1 ion channel pore properties are dictated by C-terminal region.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 7223Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar; Song et al., 2019Song Y. Li D. Farrelly O. Miles L. Li F. Kim S.E. Lo T.Y. Wang F. Li T. Thompson-Peer K.L. et al.The mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo inhibits axon regeneration.Neuron. 2019; 102: 373-389.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) failed to rescue the overconsumption phenotype as full-length mouse Piezo1 or human Piezo1 did (Figure 1I). Taken together, our results demonstrate that Piezo mediates satiety signals to inhibit food intake independent of the taste or nutritional value of the food, supporting the notion that these signals arise from mechanical distension along the digestive tract during feeding. To investigate how the mechanosensitive channel Piezo might regulate feeding, we examined the expression pattern of the Piezo protein using the piezo-Gal4 line. We observed arborizations of the Piezo+ neurons on the crop, an organ for initial food storage during feeding (Figures 2A and 2B ). The neurites appeared to descend from the brain, branch on the proventriculus, and then extend to the crop along the crop duct. The nerve terminals arborize extensively to cover the crop wall (Figure 2C). Moreover, these neurites were stained positive for GFP in a piezoGFP knockin fly (Figure S2A), indicating that they are sensory afferents that relay the information of the crop volume to the brain. The morphology and location of these Piezo+ neurons make them well positioned to sense volume change of the crop during feeding. To uncover the identity of these neurons, we performed a screen to identify subsets of Piezo+ neurons that innervate the crop by intersecting the piezo-Gal4 with different LexA driver lines with FLP-recombinase-mediated recombination (Bohm et al., 2010Bohm R.A. Welch W.P. Goodnight L.K. Cox L.W. Henry L.G. Gunter T.C. Bao H. Zhang B. A genetic mosaic approach for neural circuit mapping in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2010; 107: 16378-16383Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We found a Dilp2-LexA line that labels insulin-producing cells of the flies, when intersecting with piezo-Gal4, marked the crop Piezo+ neurons (Figure 2D). This Dilp2-LexA had an expression pattern similar to that of Dilp2-Gal4, which predominantly labels the insulin-producing cells (IPC neurons) in the PI region (Sakai et al., 2014Sakai T. Watanabe K. Ohashi H. Sato S. Inami S. Shimada N. Kitamoto T. Insulin-producing cells regulate the sexual receptivity through the painless TRP channel in Drosophila virgin females.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e88175Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and this was further validated with double labeling of the Dilp2-LexA and Dilp2-Gal4 lines (Figure S2B). The neurons labeled with the Dilp2-LexA driver or the intersection between the Dilp2 and piezo drivers were stained positive for DILP2 (Figures S2C and S2E). These results indicate that the cell body clusters are Dilp2+ cells, and the Dilp2-LexA driver faithfully labels Dilp2+ cells. Furthermore, the neurites of the Dilp2-Gal4 were similar to those from the Piezo+ IPC neurons (Figures 2G–2I), indicating that the Piezo+ IPC neurons are a subset of Dilp2 neurons that innervate the crop. The Piezo+ IPC neurons have their cell bodies located in the cluster of neuro-secretory cells at the PI region and send their neurites along the brain mid-line to reach the esophagus (Figures 2G and 2H). These neurites branch in the saddle of the subesophageal zone (SEZ) and then continue to traverse along the esophagus and the crop duct all the way to the crop wall (Figures 2F and 2I). To better characterize the neurites on the crop wall, we used Dilp2-Gal4 to drive the expression of Denmark and syt-GFP to label the dendrites and axons, respectively. The neurites on the crop wall express both dendritic and axonal markers (Figure 2J), indicating that the neurites are a mix of efferent and afferent nerves. We next asked whether the Piezo channel functions in Piezo+ IPC neurons to prevent over-feeding by using Dilp2-Gal4 to specifically knock down Piezo expression in the IPC neurons. Reducing Piezo function only in IPC neurons resulted in overconsumption (Figure 3A) as severe as that of piezo mutant flies, supporting the notion that Piezo+ IPC neurons are critical for mechanical feeding control. Previous studies have demonstrated that insulin and IPC neurons play multifaceted roles in feeding regulation in Drosophila (Oh et al., 2019Oh Y. Lai J.S.-Y. Mills H.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Giammarinaro B. Saadipour K. Wang J.G. Abu F. Neubert T.A. Suh G.S.B. A glucose-sensing neuron pair regulates insulin and glucagon in Drosophila.Nature. 2019; 574: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, acute effects of this regulation have not received much attention. As flies usually finish a meal in less than a minute (Yapici et al., 2016Yapici N. Cohn R. Schusterreiter C. Ruta V. Vosshall L.B. A taste circuit that regulates ingestion by integrating food and hunger signals.Cell. 2016; 165: 715-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we reasoned that crop distention that results from food influx activates Piezo+ IPC neurons to terminate further food intake. To test this hypothesis, we introduced a temperature-sensitive dominant-negative form of dynamin (shibirets, shits) to reversibly block synaptic transmission in IPC neurons. At the permissive temperature, the Dilp2-Gal4 > UAS-shits flies consumed the normal amount of food (Figure 3B). In contrast, when tested under the restrictive temperature, they consumed markedly more food compared with the control group (Figure 3B). In a converse experiment, we used the warmth-sensitive cation channel TrpA1 (Hamada et al., 2008Hamada F.N. Rosenzweig M. Kang K. Pulver S.R. Ghezzi A. Jegla T.J. Garrity P.A. An internal thermal sensor controlling temperature preference in Drosophila.Nature. 2008; 454: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) to transiently activate IPC neurons at 30°C. The flies consumed significantly less compared with those at 22°C or control flies at either 22°C or 30°C (Figure 3C). Importantly, by intersecting Dilp2-LexA and Piezo-Gal4, we were able to manipulate the activity of only Piezo+ IPC neurons. Acute block or activation of those neurons was sufficient to increase or decrease feeding, respectively (Figures 3D and 3E). Taken together, our results demonstrate that IPC neurons are both necessary and sufficient to convey rapid satiety signal during feeding to prevent overconsumption. To achieve better temporal resolution of feeding behavior, we performed optogenetic experiments to test whether rapid activation or inhibition of IPCs affected feeding. When Dilp2 neurons expressing CsChrimson were activated with light, flies fed significantly less under the same fasting condition (Figure 3F). Additionally, light of stronger intensity produced more profound inhibition on feeding, indicating that the activity of IPC neurons is negatively correlated with feeding (Figure 3F). In contrast, when these neurons were inhibited by light-gated anion channel GtACR, the flies showed an overconsumption phenotype (Figure 3G). There are 14–20 IPC neurons in the fly brain (Nässel et al., 2013Nässel D.R. Kubrak O.I. Liu Y. Luo J. Lushchak O.V. Factors that regulate insulin producing cells and their output in Drosophila.Front. Physiol. 2013; 4: 252Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar; Ohhara et al., 2018Ohhara Y. Kobayashi S. Yamakawa-Kobayashi K. Yamanaka N. Adult-specific insulin-producing neurons in Drosophila melanogaster.J. Comp. Neurol. 2018; 526: 1351-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar; Figure S3). Among these, about 6 or 7 neurons are Dilp2+/Piezo+ (Figure 2H) and ∼14 neurons are Dilp2+/piezo− (Figure S2D). By using Piezo-LexA > LexAop-Gal80 to express CsChrimson only in the Dilp2+/piezo− neurons, the inhibition of feeding was eliminated (Figure 3F). This result suggests that the Dilp2+/piezo− neurons are not required for the mechanical inhibition of feeding. To reveal the fine structures of individual Piezo+/Dilp2+ neurons that innervate the crop, we used heat-shock controlled flippase to stochastically label subsets of Dilp2+ neurons (hs-Flp; UAS (FRT.stop) CsChrimson-mVenus/+; Dilp2-GAL4/+). Of 300 flies examined, there were seven brains with single-neuron labeling and neurites on the crop (Figure S2F). The neurites of the single neurons were much sparser compared with the projections from Dilp2-GAL4 > UAS-GFP (Figures S2F and S2G). Importantly, compared with the intense cove"

This study aimed to investigate the association between students' weight status and their eating behaviors and practices. Another aim was to assess students' awareness of the health risks associated with obesity. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a sample of 416 (53% male and 47% female) undergraduate students, aged 18–26 years old, between January 6 and April 6, 2019, from colleges of Health Sciences at Jazan University in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (K.S.A). Students completed a self‐administered questionnaire and recorded their measured anthropometric parameters. Results The prevalence of overweight (20.4%) and obesity (14.9%) were relatively high among the participants. There were statistically significant associations between Body Mass Index (BMI) and the different settings of food consumption (i.e., dining on a table (or) in the Islamic way: squatting on the ground) (p<0.001)). BMI was also associated with students' dietary habits regarding consuming food, snacks, and drinking carbonated beverages while watching television (p<0.001), as well as consuming the same pattern of food/drink while watching television, playing video games on mobile phones or computers (p<0.001). Nearly most of the students were oblivious to the fact that metabolic syndrome, reproductive disorders, respiratory disorders along with liver and gallbladder diseases are some of the health risks associated with obesity. Conclusion The prevalence of obesity and overweight were reasonably high in our study sample and were affected by several factors related to students' eating behaviors and practices. This warrants the need for rigorous and frequent health education interventions on healthy eating behaviors, dietary practices, with an emphasis on the importance of adopting an active, healthy lifestyle."

Since its early days in the 1990s, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has had a tremendous impact on the field of neuroscience, substantially advancing our understanding of the central nervous system (CNS). Relying on non-invasive detection of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes, this imaging technique offers meaningful insights into the underlying neuronal activity (Logothetis et al., 2001Logothetis N.K. Pauls J. Augath M. Trinath T. Oeltermann A. Neurophysiological investigation of the basis of the fMRI signal.Nature. 2001; 412: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (4421) Google Scholar). As such, it has been widely deployed to investigate system-level brain function, not only during tasks but also at rest, with fMRI studies focusing on the spontaneous fluctuations of the BOLD signals (van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol, 2010van den Heuvel M.P. Hulshoff Pol H.E. Exploring the brain network: a review on resting-state fMRI functional connectivity.Eur. Neuropsychopharmacol. 2010; 20: 519-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). In this context, resting-state networks (RSNs) are conventionally extracted using functional connectivity (FC) measures based on the coherent activation (e.g., Pearson correlation) of distinct brain regions. These intrinsic networks have emerged as the building blocks of human brain function (Damoiseaux et al., 2006Damoiseaux J.S. Rombouts S.A.R.B. Barkhof F. Scheltens P. Stam C.J. Smith S.M. Beckmann C.F. Consistent resting-state networks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 13848-13853Crossref PubMed Scopus (3009) Google Scholar), and their activity has been shown to encode a wide array of behavioral traits, from emotion to intellectual performances (Greicius et al., 2003Greicius M.D. Krasnow B. Reiss A.L. Menon V. Functional connectivity in the resting brain: a network analysis of the default mode hypothesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (4496) Google Scholar; Liégeois et al., 2019Liégeois R. Li J. Kong R. Orban C. Van De Ville D. Ge T. Sabuncu M.R. Yeo B.T.T. Resting brain dynamics at different timescales capture distinct aspects of human behavior.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Besides, their widespread alteration in neurological diseases also support their clinical relevance and their potential as biomarkers of functional integrity (Allali et al., 2018Allali G. Blumen H.M. Devanne H. Pirondini E. Delval A. Van De Ville D. Brain imaging of locomotion in neurological conditions.Neurophysiol. Clin. 2018; 48: 337-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar; Castellanos et al., 2013Castellanos F.X. Di Martino A. Craddock R.C. Mehta A.D. Milham M.P. Clinical applications of the functional connectome.Neuroimage. 2013; 80: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, this exploration of the functional architecture of the human CNS in vivo has been essentially focused on the brain. In contrast, the spinal cord, another component of the CNS, has been mostly overlooked, even though this structure plays a crucial role in sensorimotor processing, for instance in proprioception, pain processing, or during movement generation and control (Darby and Frysztak, 2013Darby S.A. Frysztak R.J. Neuroanatomy of the spinal cord.in: Clinical Anatomy of the Spine, Spinal Cord, and ANS. Third Edit. Elsevier Inc., 2013Google Scholar). As such, insights into the intrinsic functional organization of human spinal circuits appear as pivotal contributions to fundamental and clinical neurosciences. This limited amount of research may partly stem from the inaccessibility of the spinal cord, a small structure deeply encapsulated in the vertebral column (Marieb and Hoehn, 2014Marieb E.N. Hoehn K.N. Human Anatomy & Physiology. Pearson, 2014Google Scholar; Powers et al., 2018Powers J.M. Ioachim G. Stroman P.W. Ten key insights into the use of spinal cord fMRI.Brain Sci. 2018; 8: 173Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Imaging this region is indeed particularly challenging, as the adjacent bones and organs make it prone to field inhomogeneities and physiological noise (Giove et al., 2004Giove F. Garreffa G.

This may explain why functional activity of the spinal cord was, at first, mainly explored using indirect peripheral measurements (e.g., muscle activity, force, reflexes, or sensory tests) (Greenberg, 2003Greenberg S.A. The history of dermatome mapping.Arch. Neurol. 2003; 60: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar; Knikou, 2008Knikou M. The H-reflex as a probe: pathways and pitfalls.J. Neurosci.

Moreover, the validity of BOLD signals as a hemodynamic proxy of spinal neural activity was recently confirmed in non-human primates, as signal variations were shown to be in agreement with electrophysiological activity (i.e., local field potentials) (Wu et al., 2019Wu T.L. Yang P.F. Wang F. Shi Z. Mishra A. Wu R. Chen L.M. Gore J.C. Intrinsic functional architecture of the non-human primate spinal cord derived from fMRI and electrophysiology.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Spinal cord fMRI studies have primarily focused on task-evoked activity, offering an unparalleled opportunity to examine the human spinal cord in action (Wheeler-Kingshott et al., 2014Wheeler-Kingshott C.A.

Spontaneous signal fluctuations, on the other hand, were only explored in recent years. Sensory and motor RSNs were first reported using different approaches, such as seed-based FC (at 3T, Eippert et al., 2017bEippert F. Kong Y. Winkler A.M. Andersson J.L. Finsterbusch J. Büchel C.

Although these studies demonstrated the existence of functional circuits in the spinal cord at rest, their neurophysiological underpinnings remained unclear (Eippert and Tracey, 2014Eippert F. Tracey I. The spinal cord is never at rest.eLife. 2014; 3: e03811Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A critical factor that hindered thorough characterization of the nature of spinal networks was the use of static measures of FC, as all earlier studies assumed temporal stationarity over the scanning session. As a result, they did not consider the dynamic evolution of interactions over time, and they could not fully capture the properties of functional networks (Calhoun et al., 2001Calhoun V.D. Adali T. Pearlson G.D. Pekar J.J. A method for making group inferences from functional MRI data using independent component analysis.Hum. Brain Mapp. 2001; 14: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). In the brain, however, it has been highlighted that FC fluctuates at the timescale of seconds, and numerous dynamic FC (dFC) approaches have been proposed to delve into these time-varying properties (Preti et al., 2016Preti M.G. Bolton T.A. Van De Ville D. The dynamic functional connectome: State-of-the-art and perspectives.Neuroimage. 2016; 160: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). This finding has provided new insights into the properties of resting-state (RS) signals, as well as informed on the disrupted dynamic interplay of distinct brain regions in various neurological disorders. Here, we posit that dynamic methods could enable disentangling the ongoing sustained spinal activity, possibly revealing new attributes of spinal RSNs. To this end, we leveraged a promising approach to extract dynamic RS components, termed innovation-driven co-activation patterns (iCAPs). In this context, the term innovation refers to transient activity, which is recovered using robust hemodynamic-informed deconvolution (Karahanoğlu et al., 2013Karahanoğlu F.I. Caballero-Gaudes C. Lazeyras F. Van de Ville D. Total activation: fMRI deconvolution through spatio-temporal regularization.Neuroimage. 2013; 73: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Patterns obtained using transients constitute the building blocks of time-resolved activity and offer a unique way to temporally dissect overlapping signals. Notably, this has previously enabled the separation of known brain RSNs (e.g., the default mode network) into multiple subsystems (Karahanoğlu and Van De Ville, 2015Karahanoğlu F.I. Van De Ville D. Transient brain activity disentangles fMRI resting-state dynamics in terms of spatially and temporally overlapping networks.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 7751Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Capitalizing on this potential to unfold ongoing functional activity, we combined this method with a dedicated spinal cord fMRI pipeline into the spinal iCAP (SpiCiCAP) framework. Using this framework, we assessed spatial and temporal properties of cervical RS activity in healthy participants and uncovered precise features of the spinal cord functional architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that fine-grained RS components are revealed in the spinal cord. This unparalleled level of detail allowed us to shed new light on their neuroanatomical nature, as well as to further characterize their physiological roles and, hence, emphasize their involvement in distributed neural pathways supporting ascending sensory feedback (e.g., for proprioception) and descending communication from supraspinal structures (e.g., for motor control). The SpiCiCAP framework could foster relevant advances in our understanding of spinal cord function, not only at rest but also when dynamically modulated in sensory and motor tasks. Finally, this framework opens an avenue to map spinal circuits in neurological conditions and to investigate the mechanisms associated with dysfunction and recovery. Our goal was to achieve a deeper understanding of spinal cord’s functional architecture. To this end, we reasoned that exploring the time-varying content of spinal spontaneous fluctuations would bring new light on their neurophysiological nature. The SpiCiCAP framework, whose approach is outlined in Figure 1, integrates tailored spinal cord fMRI protocols with a state-of-the-art method to extract dynamic RSNs by using clustering of hemodynamic-informed transients. It enables us the ability to decompose spinal circuits and to investigate their spatiotemporal properties. Using the SpiCiCAP framework, we extracted spinal iCAPs for two levels of granularity (i.e., temporal clustering done independently for two different parameters K, 4 or 40, corresponding to the number of iCAPs; see Figure 1). The choice of these two levels of granularity was supported by a systematic evaluation of clustering reproducibility for different Ks (details presented in Figure S3). Visual inspection of the recovered iCAPs confirmed the absence of noisy spatial patterns (Figure 2). Components displayed high spatial segregation, as underlined by the limited overlap between iCAP maps (Figure S5). In line with previous studies (Kong et al., 2014Kong Y. Eippert F. Beckmann C.F. Andersson J. Finsterbusch J. Büchel C. Tracey I. Brooks J.C.W. Intrinsically organized resting state networks in the human spinal cord.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 18067-18072Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar; Weber et al., 2018Weber II, K.A. Sentis A.I. Bernadel-Huey O.N. Chen Y. Wang X. Parrish T.B. Mackey S. Thermal Stimulation Alters Cervical Spinal Cord Functional Connectivity in Humans.Neuroscience. 2018; 369: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), spinal iCAPs spanned a limited rostro-caudal extent, likely reflecting the segmental structure of the spinal cord. Specifically, low-level granularity iCAPs corresponded to spinal levels C5 to C8 (Figure 2B), with on average 91% of their voxels in a single spinal level (Figure S5). The specificity of the matching between iCAPs and segmental borders was confirmed using Dice coefficients (mean ± SD = 0.71 ± 0.03). For this low-level granularity, all iCAPs were bilateral and included dorsal and ventral components (Figure S4). When increasing the granularity to 40 iCAPs, we observed that components were further subdivided within the axial plane (Figure 2C), with high-granularity iCAPs that were predominantly unilateral and strictly confined to either the dorsal or ventral side. To achieve a comprehensive description of this axial organization, we harnessed a detailed atlas of the spinal cord (Lévy et al., 2015Lévy S. Benhamou M. Naaman C. Rainville P. Callot V. Cohen-Adad J. White matter atlas of the human spinal cord with estimation of partial volume effect.Neuroimage. 2015; 119: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar; Figure S2) to precisely quantify the axial voxel distribution. For each of these fine-grained iCAPs, voxels were distributed over a restricted number of atlas regions (on average, two regions per iCAP included 68% of its voxels; Figure S5), emphasizing that the activity patterns were highly localized and structured. Each spinal component was, thus, matched to a specific atlas region (mean Dice coefficient ± SD = 0.61 ± 0.11). Overall, these results illustrated the high correspondence between the components extracted using the SpiCiCAP framework and the underlying neuroanatomy of the spinal cord. To further inspect the neuroanatomical identity of the 40 spinal iCAPs, we used the hard assignment proposed above (i.e., each iCAP uniquely matched with an atlas region) and computed the number of iCAPs found in each of the atlas regions, so as to seek whether an organized topographical distribution could be highlighted (Figure 3). We observed that iCAPs fell into a limited number of regions, i.e., 12 of the 36 atlas regions (see Figure S2 for the exhaustive list), which corresponded to six distinct neuroanatomical zones comprising both gray (i.e., ventral horns and intermediate regions) and white matter (i.e., the dorsal column, formed by the fasciculus gracilis, and fasciculus cuneatus, the cortico-spinal tract, and the medial lemniscus). For each of them, iCAPs were present in both left and right lateralization. We then investigated whether this apparent sparsity, driven by fMRI activity, had a functional meaning. An examination of the different roles of these regions (Figure S2; Darby and Frysztak, 2013Darby S.A. Frysztak R.J. Neuroanatomy of the spinal cord.in: Clinical Anatomy of the Spine, Spinal Cord, and ANS. Third Edit. Elsevier Inc., 2013Google Scholar) revealed that iCAPs were essentially organized following two neural pathways of the spinal cord: 18 iCAPs relied on the cortico-spinal tract pathway (CST), whereas 16 iCAPs corresponded to the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway (DCML) (Figure 3A). These pathways fulfill distinct functional contributions (Figure 3B), as they are involved in conveying and processing signals from (e.g., for motor control) and to (e.g., for proprioception) the brain, respectively (Darby and Frysztak, 2013Darby S.A. Frysztak R.J. Neuroanatomy of the spinal cord.in: Clinical Anatomy of the Spine, Spinal Cord, and ANS. Third Edit. Elsevier Inc., 2013Google Scholar). The former is a descending pathway that goes from the motor cortex to the ventral horns (regions 31–32), through the cortico-spinal tract (regions 5–6). The latter is an ascending pathway, sending proprioceptive and sensory information from the periphery to the somatosensory cortex by traveling through the dorsal column (regions 1–4) and the medial lemniscus (regions 13–14). Finally, 6 iCAPs were found in the intermediate zone, INTER (regions 33–34), at the interface between these ascending and descending pathways. The rostro-caudal distribution of the iCAPs underlined a uniform presence of ascending and descending pathways from C5 to C8, whereas no intermediate regions were found in C8 (Figure 3C). To evaluate the distance between iCAPs along the two pathways, we computed the mean rostro-caudal position of the associated iCAPs in each spinal level. The average spatial gaps along the CST and DCML were 17.88 ± 1.70 mm and 18.43 ± 0.6 mm (mean ± SD over spinal levels), respectively, which are in line with the anatomical distance between spinal levels (Cadotte et al., 2015Cadotte D.W. Cadotte A. Cohen-Adad J. Fleet D. Livne M. Wilson J.R. Mikulis D. Nugaeva N. Fehlings M.G. Characterizing the location of spinal and vertebral levels in the human cervical spinal cord.AJNR Am. J. Neuroradiol. 2015; 36: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In summary, these results suggested that the recovered spinal iCAPs were functionally relevant. This idea hints at the potential of the proposed framework to non-invasively monitor the neural mechanisms underlying information flow and processing, both locally in the spinal cord and in relation to inputs from the brain and the periphery. We evaluated the consistency of the observed iCAPs both within and between subjects. First, we assessed the intra-subject stability by splitting each subject’s dataset into two equal parts (180 volumes each, i.e., 7.5 min) in which we recomputed iCAPs independently (Figure 4A). The intra-subject stability was particularly high for the low-granularity iCAPs (mean Dice coefficient ± SD of 0.83 ± 0.08), indicating that the coarse functional organization was stable over time within the same subjects. Conversely, the stability of fine-grained spatial patterns was more variable (mean Dice coefficient ± SD of 0.38 ± 0.20), with 12 iCAPs displaying Dice coefficients superior to 0.5 (maximum value of 0.84), whereas 7 iCAPs exhibited coefficients lower than 0.2 (minimum value of 0.06). ICAPs with low and high Dice coefficients were distributed over the different pathways, with no specific pattern. Despite this variability, both sets of iCAPs were in line with the underlying neuroanatomy (mean Dice coefficient with atlas regions ± SD of 0.63 ± 0.10 for part 1 and 0.61 ± 0.10 for part 2). Moreover, they carried similar functional relevance, as atlas regions of the two parts could still be clustered into the same pathways (ascending DCML, descending CST, and intermediate INTER) (Figure S6). We then probed inter-subject stability by comparing the iCAPs maps of all subjects for each iCAP pair of the full dataset. The spatial patterns were similar across subjects (Figure 4B), as highlighted by the diagonal matrices obtained for low- and high-granularity iCAPs (mean Dice coefficient ± SD of 0.49 ± 0.05 and 0.51 ± 0.06 for the different levels of granularity, respectively). Altogether, these findings underlined the stability of the spinal cord’s functional organization, along with the potential of iCAPs to represent its underlying building blocks. Capitalizing on this stable spatial organization, we probed the temporal features of the 40 fine-grained spinal iCAPs. Each iCAP occurrence lasted on average 2.71 ± 0.15 volumes (mean over iCAPs ± SD, no significant difference between iCAPs), for a total duration of activation (positive and negative occurrences) of 27.42% ± 1.82% (mean over iCAPs ± SD, percentage of run length, no significant difference between iCAPs). A substantial amount of temporal overlap was observed between iCAPs, with an average of 10.97 ± 0.17 co-active iCAPs at each time point (mean over subjects ± SE; Figure 5A). To better understand the features of this large temporal overlap, we explored the (anti-)couplings between the 40 iCAPs (Figures 5B–5D). Overall, couplings (mean Jaccard index over subjects ± SE = 0.15 ± 0.007) were significantly stronger than anti-couplings (0.04 ± 0.003, p < 0.001), and they exhibited distinct behaviors. Specifically, larger couplings were observed within level (0.17 ± 0.005) than between levels (0.13 ± 0.004, p < 0.001). Conversely, anti-couplings were more prominent between levels (0.05 ± 0.002) than within level (0.03 ± 0.002, p < 0.001). This notable interplay between spinal iCAPs was stable across subjects, both for couplings (mean cosine similarity over subjects ± SE of 0.88 ± 0.01) and anti-couplings (0.76 ± 0.01). These results corroborated the hypothesis that spinal cord spontaneous fluctuations are highly entwined, prompting the need for dynamic approaches to dissect this activity. Finally, we examined the interactions between iCAPs grouped according to their neural relevance (ascending, descending, or intermediate), to potentially uncover distinctions regarding their coupling properties. Interaction profiles specific to each pathway (i.e., between the iCAPs belonging to the same pathway; Figure 6A) were highlighted, in particular in terms of within-level interactions. Couplings appeared larger inside the intermediate zone, whereas they were smaller in the ascending and descending pathways, especially for the former. Anti-couplings followed an opposite trend. The strong coupling inside the intermediate zone might be attributed to commissural interneurons, whose axons cross the midline to link the two hemicords. When assessing the interactions shared across pathways (i.e., between the iCAPs belonging to different pathways; Figure 6B), we found that the intermediate zone was differently coupled with the two others pathways, with stronger couplings occurring with the ascending regions. Anti-couplings, however, did not display any clear tendency. To further investigate whether these distinctions were inherent properties of connectivity inside and across neural pathways, we attempted to classify them using the aforementioned features (couplings and anti-couplings, within and between levels). We were able to distinguish interactions occurring inside the ascending and intermediate pathways, as they could be discriminated with high accuracy (73.7%, p < 0.01 and 63.2%, p < 0.05, respectively; non-parametric permutation testing against chance level, i.e., ∼33.3%), confirming their distinct behaviors. Internal couplings within the descending pathways exhibited a more hybrid profile, resulting in a lower classification accuracy (52.6%, not significant). When looking at the interactions across neural pathways, we found the highest accuracy for the relationship between the ascending and descending pathways (63.3%, p < 0.01), although the interactions across the intermediate zones and the two other pathways could also be classified (57.9%, p < 0.05). This finding suggests that peculiar interactions exist between pathways, as they are engaged to support disparate sensorimotor functions. In previous work, RSNs were shown to be a feature of the entire CNS, with the spinal cord demonstrating an intrinsic functional organization akin to the recognized brain’s functional architecture (van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol, 2010van den Heuvel M.P. Hulshoff Pol H.E. Exploring the brain network: a review on resting-state fMRI functional connectivity.Eur. Neuropsychopharmacol. 2010; 20: 519-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Although this organization has been presumed to support sensory, motor, or autonomic functions, its neurophysiological purpose has so far remained elusive. Former studies had solely focused on static FC, which merely reflects the average organization over the course of a functional run. In this regard, exploiting the dynamic features of spinal spontaneous activity could promote new insights into its physiological nature. In this study, we leveraged state-of-the-art spinal cord fMRI protocols, combined with a dFC method (Karahanoğlu and Van De Ville, 2015Karahanoğlu F.I. Van De Ville D. Transient brain activity disentangles fMRI resting-state dynamics in terms of spatially and temporally overlapping networks.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 7751Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and deployed the SpiCiCAP framework to unweave spinal RS"

Melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, exerts neuroprotective effects against brain damage. However, the effect of melatonin on diabetes-induced brain injury has not been elucidated. This study was to evaluate the role of melatonin against neuronal death in DM and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Herein, we found that melatonin administration significantly alleviated the neuronal death in both streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice and high glucose (HG)-treated neuronal cells. Melatonin inhibited neuronal pyroptosis and excessive autophagy, as evidenced by decreased levels of NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, GSDMD-N, IL-1β, LC3, Beclin1, and ATG12 both in vivo and in vitro. MicroRNA-214-3p (miR-214-3p) was decreased in DM mice and HG-treated cells, and such a downregulation was corrected by melatonin, which was accompanied by repression of caspase-1 and ATG12. Furthermore, downregulation of miR-214-3p abrogated the anti-pyroptotic and anti-autophagic actions of melatonin in vitro. Our results indicate that melatonin exhibits a neuroprotective effect by inhibiting neuronal pyroptosis and excessive autophagy through modulating the miR-214-3p/caspase-1 and miR-214-3p/ATG12 axes, respectively, and it might be a potential agent for the treatment of brain damage in the setting of DM."
https://openalex.org/W3085335084,"Introduction We conducted an implementation science study to increase TB case detection through a combination of interventions at health facility and community levels. We determined the impact of the study in terms of additional cases detected and notification rate and compared the yield of bacteriologically confirmed TB of facility based and community based case finding. Methodology Over a period of 18 months, similar case finding activities were conducted at George health facility in Lusaka Zambia and its catchment community, an informal peri-urban settlement. Activities included awareness and demand creation activities, TB screening with digital chest x-ray or symptom screening, sputum evaluation using geneXpert MTB/RIF, TB diagnosis and linkage to treatment. Results A total of 18,194 individuals were screened of which 9,846 (54.1%) were screened at the facility and 8,348 (45.9%) were screened in the community. The total number of TB cases diagnosed during the intervention period were 1,026, compared to 759 in the pre-intervention period; an additional 267 TB cases were diagnosed. Of the 563 bacteriologically confirmed TB cases diagnosed under the study, 515/563 (91.5%) and 48/563 (8.5%) were identified at the facility and in the community respectively (P<0.0001). The TB notification rate increased from 246 per 100,000 population pre-intervention to 395 per 100,000 population in the last year of the intervention. Conclusions Facility active case finding was more effective in detecting TB cases than community active case finding. Strengthening health systems to appropriately identify and evaluate patients for TB needs to be optimised in high burden settings. At a minimum, provider initiated TB symptom screening with completion of the TB screening and diagnostic cascade should be provided at the health facility in high burden settings. Community screening needs to be systematic and targeted at high risk groups and communities with access barriers."
https://openalex.org/W3083923676,"Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO1-3) conjugation (SUMOylation), a posttranslational modification, modulates almost all major cellular processes. Mounting evidence indicates that SUMOylation plays a crucial role in maintaining and regulating neural function, and importantly its dysfunction is implicated in cognitive impairment in humans. We have previously shown that simultaneously silencing SUMO1-3 expression in neurons negatively affects cognitive function. However, the roles of the individual SUMOs in modulating cognition and the mechanisms that link SUMOylation to cognitive processes remain unknown. To address these questions, in this study, we have focused on SUMO2 and generated a new conditional Sumo2 knockout mouse line. We found that conditional deletion of Sumo2 predominantly in forebrain neurons resulted in marked impairments in various cognitive tests, including episodic and fear memory. Our data further suggest that these abnormalities are attributable neither to constitutive changes in gene expression nor to alterations in neuronal morphology, but they involve impairment in dynamic SUMOylation processes associated with synaptic plasticity. Finally, we provide evidence that dysfunction on hippocampal-based cognitive tasks was associated with a significant deficit in the maintenance of hippocampal long-term potentiation in Sumo2 knockout mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate that protein conjugation by SUMO2 is critically involved in cognitive processes."
https://openalex.org/W3084771383,"Any type of non-buoyant material in the ocean is transported horizontally by currents during its sinking journey. This lateral transport can be far from negligible for small sinking velocities. To estimate its magnitude and direction, the material is often modelled as a set of Lagrangian particles advected by current velocities that are obtained from Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs). State-of-the-art OGCMs are strongly eddying, similar to the real ocean, providing results with a spatial resolution on the order of 10 km on a daily frequency. While the importance of eddies in OGCMs is well-appreciated in the physical oceanographic community, other marine research communities may not. To demonstrate how much the absence of mesoscale features in low-resolution models influences the Lagrangian particle transport, we simulate the transport of sinking Lagrangian particles using low- and high-resolution global OGCMs, and assess the lateral transport differences resulting from the difference in spatial and temporal model resolution. We find major differences between the transport in the non-eddying OGCM and in the eddying OGCM. Addition of stochastic noise to the particle trajectories in the non-eddying OGCM parameterises the effect of eddies well in some cases. The effect of a coarser temporal resolution (5-daily) is smaller compared to a coarser spatial resolution (0.1$^{\circ}$ versus 1$^{\circ}$ horizontally). We recommend to use sinking Lagrangian particles, representing e.g. marine snow, microplankton or sinking plastic, only with velocity fields from eddying OGCMs, requiring high-resolution models in e.g. paleoceanographic studies. To increase the accessibility of our particle trace simulations, we launch planktondrift.science.uu.nl, an online tool to reconstruct the surface origin of sedimentary particles in a specific location."

https://openalex.org/W3086910272,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen causing different types of infections, particularly in intensive care unit patients. Characteristics that favor its persistence artificial environments are related to its high adaptability, wide arsenal of virulence factors and resistance to several antimicrobial classes. Among the several virulence determinants, T3SS stands as the most important due to the clinical impact of exoS and exoU genes in patient’s outcome. The molecular characterization of P. aeruginosa isolates helps in the comprehension of transmission dynamics and enhance knowledge of virulence and resistance roles in infection process. In the present study, we investigated virulence and resistance properties and the genetic background of P. aeruginosa isolated from ICUs patients at a referral hospital in Brazilian Amazon. A total of 54 P. aeruginosa isolates were characterized by detecting 19 virulence-related genes, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, molecular detection of β-lactamase-encoding genes and genotyping by MLST and rep-PCR. Our findings showed high prevalence of virulence-related markers, where 53.7% of the isolates presented at least 17 genes among the 19 investigated (P = 0.01). The rare exoS+/exoU+ cytotoxic virulotype was detected in 55.6% of isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed percentages of antibiotic resistance above 50% to carbapenems, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones associated to MDR/XDR isolates. Isolates harboring both blaSPM-1 and blaOXA genes were also detected. Genotyping methods demonstrated a wide genetic diversity of strains spread among the different intensive care units, circulation of international MDR/XDR high-risk clones (ST111, ST235, ST244 and ST277) and emergence of seven novel MLST lineages. Finally, our findings highlight the circulation of strains with high virulence potential and resistance to antimicrobials and may be useful on comprehension of pathogenicity process, treatment guidance and establishment of strategies to control the spread of epidemic P. aeruginosa strains."

Motivated by the behavior of SARS-CoV-2, we construct a theoretical SIR model of a virus that exhibits presymptomatic, asymptomatic, and symptomatic stages in two possible pathways. Using agent-based simulations on small world networks, we observe phase transitions for epidemic spread related to: 1) Global social distancing with a fixed probability of adherence. 2) Individually initiated social isolation when a threshold number of contacts are infected. 3) Viral shedding rate. The primary driver of total number of infections is the viral shedding rate, with probability of social distancing being the next critical factor. Individually initiated social isolation was effective when initiated in response to a single infected contact. For each of these control measures, the total number of infections exhibits a sharp phase transition as the strength of the measure is varied."

Most countries are developing malaria elimination plans to meet sustainable development goal three, target 3.3, which includes ending the epidemic of malaria by 2030. Rwanda, through the malaria strategic plan 2012-2018 set a target to reduce malaria incidence by 42% from 2012 to 2018. Assessing the health policy and taking a decision using the incidence rate approach is becoming more challenging. We are proposing suitable statistical methods that handle spatial structure and uncertainty on the relative risk that is relevant to National Malaria Control Program. We used a spatio-temporal model to estimate the excess probability for decision making at a small area on evaluating reduction of incidence. SIR and BYM models were developed using routine data from Health facilities for the period from 2012 to 2018 in Rwanda. The fitted model was used to generate relative risk (RR) estimates comparing the risk with the malaria risk in 2012, and to assess the probability of attaining the set target goal per area. The results showed an overall increase in malaria in 2013 to 2018 as compared to 2012. Ofall sectors in Rwanda, 47.36% failed to meet targeted reduction in incidence from 2012 to 2018. Our approach of using excess probability method to evaluate attainment of target or identifying threshold is a relevant statistical method, which will enable the Rwandan Government to sustain malaria control and monitor the effectiveness of targeted interventions."

We observed that MDA-MB231 tumor cells express muscarinic receptors, while they are absent in the non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cell line, which was used as control. The addition of carbachol or arecaidine propargyl ester, a non-selective or a selective subtype 2 muscarinic receptor agonist respectively, plus paclitaxel reduces cell viability involving a down-regulation in the expression of ATP “binding cassette” G2 drug transporter and epidermal growth factor receptor. We also detected an inhibition of tumor cell migration and anti-angiogenic effects produced by those drug combinations in vitro and in vivo (in NUDE mice) respectively. Our findings provide substantial evidence about subtype 2 muscarinic receptors as therapeutic targets for the treatment of triple negative tumors."

Income is an important factor influencing antidepressant medication adherence. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between income level and adherence to antidepressant medication in outpatients with depression. This was a retrospective cohort study using National Health Insurance claim data for services provided between January 1 and December 31, 2012. We examined data from a total of 142,336 individuals aged 18 years or older who were continuously enrolled in treatment after a new episode of major depression and who had initiated antidepressant treatment. The operational definition of adherence to antidepressant treatment was medication being dispensed to the patient at least 80% of the time during 3 and 6 months (ie. MPR ≥80%). To investigate the relationship between income level and adherence to antidepressants, we estimated adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using hierarchical logistic regression analysis, adjusting for sociodemographic, clinical, and medical use characteristics. A total of 22.64% and 15.13% of depression patients showed adherence to antidepressants during 3 and 6 months, respectively. A statistically significant association was found between income level and adherence to antidepressants over 3 and 6 months for individuals with employee and self-employed subscribers. In addition, adherence to antidepressants was lower among those with a lower income than those with a higher income.

In both systems, maize (Zea mays) is a key crop for these two countries. For the commercial system, maize is a commodity crop while for the small-scale system it is the prime staple crop. In commercial systems, farmers predominantly grow genetically modified (GM) hybrid maize. In small-scale systems, farmers rely on open pollinated varieties (OPVs) and/or landraces and are largely dependent on seed saving systems. The aim of this study was to understand the relationship between transgene expression rates, the resulting concentrations of the transgene product (Bt protein) and its bioactivity in insect pests following transgene flow from GM hybrid maize into non-genetically modified, non-GM near-isogenic maize hybrid (ISO) and OPVs. We modeled segregation patterns and measured cry1Ab transgene expression (mRNA quantification), Cry1Ab protein concentration and pest survival. Two groups of F1, F2 crosses and backcrosses with GM, ISO and OPV maize varieties from Brazil and South Africa were used. Bioassays with the larvae of two lepidopteran maize pest species, Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera littoralis, were carried out. Overall, the cry1Ab transgene outcrossed effectively into the genetic backgrounds tested. The cry1Ab transgene was stably expressed in both ISO and OPV genetic backgrounds. Transgene introgression led to consistent, though highly variable, concentrations of Cry1Ab toxins that were similar to those observed in GM parental maize. Most crosses, but not all, suggested the expected Mendelian segregation pattern. Transgene expression rates were significantly higher than expected from purely Mendelian segregation in the South African crosses. In South African materials, ISO and OPV crosses produced significantly lower Cry1Ab concentrations compared to the GM parental maize. The Cry1Ab toxins from crosses were bioactive and induced mortality rates of ≥92.19% in H. armigera and ≥40.63% in S. littoralis after a period of only 4 days. However, no correlations were observed between the quantitation of mRNA for cry1Ab and the corresponding Cry1Ab protein concentrations, nor between the Cry1Ab concentrations and insect mortality rates across different genetic backgrounds. We therefore suggest that while transcription of the cry1Ab transgene reliably determines the presence of Cry1Ab protein, mRNA levels do not reflect, by themselves, the end Cry1Ab protein concentrations found in the plant. Because predictably high Cry1Ab concentrations are a key prerequisite for effective insect resistance management (IRM) programs, this observation raises questions about the effectiveness of such programs in scenarios with complex crop genetic backgrounds. On the other hand, confirmed bioactivity in all crosses should be expected to impact small farmer’s selection behavior, unknowingly favoring the insecticidal trait. This may lead to a fixation of the trait in the wider population, and may influence the genetic diversity of varieties maintained by small-scale farmers."
https://openalex.org/W3084743862,"Purpose To report the clinical presentation and management outcomes of glaucoma in the “Indian Twin cities retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) Screening database.” Methods All children with diagnosis of ROP and glaucoma between 1997 and 2016 from a prospective database were included. Glaucoma was classified as open when anterior chamber (AC) was deep, closed when AC was shallow or flat and neovascular when there was extensive iris neovascularization. ROP was classified based on International classification of ROP. Results The prevalence of secondary glaucoma in our cohort was 1.36% (82 eyes of 6000 children). Eighty-two eyes of 54 children with secondary glaucoma due to ROP where included in this study. The distribution of glaucoma among the ROP stages included, stage V (58.5%), stage 1V (24.3%), stage III (2.4%) and stage II (1.2%) eyes. Median (interquartile range) duration from birth to glaucoma diagnosis was 7.8 (4.2, 24.9) months. Type of glaucoma was angle closure in 39 (47.6%), open angle in 35 (42.7%) and neovascular in 8 (9.8%) eyes. Retinal interventions included vitreoretinal surgery in 59 (72%), retinal laser in 14 (17%) and intravitreal bevacizumab injection in 19 (23.1%) eyes. The mean (±standard deviation) IOP at presentation was 22.6 ±11.8 mm Hg. Glaucoma was managed medically in 66 (76%) and surgically in 16 (19.5%) eyes. The mean follow up for the entire cohort was 1.14±2.24 years. At final visit, 37% eyes with ROP and glaucoma had ambulatory vision with mean IOP of 16.0±8.1 mm Hg and 56 eyes (68.2%) needed glaucoma medications. Conclusion In this large ROP cohort, 1.36% eyes developed secondary glaucoma. Majority of them had stage V or IV ROP and 1/5 of them needed glaucoma surgery. Around 1/3rd of the ROP eyes with glaucoma had ambulatory vision."
https://openalex.org/W3084240827,"Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family related gene (GITR) is a member of the TNFR superfamily that is expressed on cells of the immune system. Although the protective and pathogenic roles of GITR in T cell immunity are well characterized, the role of GITR in innate immunity in the intestinal tissues has not been well clarified. In this study, using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model in mice, we found that GITR-deficiency rendered mice more susceptible to acute intestinal inflammation and that a significantly higher number of activated natural killer (NK) cells was accumulated in the colonic lamina propria of Gitr−/− mice as compared to wild-type mice. Additionally, Rag2−/− Gitr−/− mice, which lack T cells but have NK cells, also displayed more severe colonic inflammation than Rag2−/− mice. In contrast, an anti-GITR agonistic antibody significantly alleviated colitis in Rag2−/− mice. Engagement of GITR inhibited IL-15-mediated activating signaling events in NK cells, which include cell activation and proliferation, and production of cytokines and cytotoxic granules. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that GITR negatively controls intestinal inflammation through NK cell functions."
https://openalex.org/W3086182607,"Physical, technological, and social networks are often at risk of intentional attack. Despite the wide-spanning importance of network vulnerability, very little is known about how criminal networks respond to attacks or whether intentional attacks affect criminal activity in the long-run. To assess criminal network responsiveness, we designed an empirically-grounded agent-based simulation using population-level network data on 16,847 illicit drug exchanges between 7,295 users of an active darknet drug market and statistical methods for simulation analysis. We consider three attack strategies: targeted attacks that delete structurally integral vertices, weak link attacks that delete large numbers of weakly connected vertices, and signal attacks that saturate the network with noisy signals. Results reveal that, while targeted attacks are effective when conducted at a large-scale, weak link and signal attacks deter more potential drug transactions and buyers when only a small portion of the network is attacked. We also find that intentional attacks affect network behavior. When networks are attacked, actors grow more cautious about forging ties, connecting less frequently and only to trustworthy alters. Operating in tandem, these two processes undermine long-term network robustness and increase network vulnerability to future attacks."
https://openalex.org/W3084173861,"AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) chaperones are involved in a plethora of cellular activities to ensure protein homeostasis. The function of AAA+ chaperones is mostly modulated by their hexameric/dodecameric quaternary structures. Here we report the structural and biochemical characterizations of a tetradecameric AAA+ chaperone, ClpL from Streptococcus pneumoniae. ClpL exists as a tetradecamer in solution in the presence of ATP. The cryo-EM structure of ClpL at 4.5 A resolution reveals a striking tetradecameric arrangement. Solution structures of ClpL derived from small-angle X-ray scattering data suggest that the tetradecameric ClpL could assume a spiral conformation found in active hexameric/dodecameric AAA+ chaperone structures. Vertical positioning of the middle domain accounts for the head-to-head arrangement of two heptameric rings. Biochemical activity assays with site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the critical roles of residues both in the integrity of the tetradecameric arrangement and activities of ClpL. Non-conserved Q321 and R670 are crucial in the heptameric ring assembly of ClpL. These results establish that ClpL is a functionally active tetradecamer, clearly distinct from hexameric/dodecameric AAA+ chaperones."

A timely understanding of dynamic changes in the water conservation function is important for the protection and reconstruction of water resources. Based on remote sensing data, meteorological data, land cover data, and the “Technical Criterion for Ecosystem Status Evaluation” issued by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People’s Republic of China, a comprehensive evaluation system was designed to assess the water conservation function of the Xiongan New Area from 2005 to 2015. The system created from four aspects, including ecological structure, ecological stress, water balance and landscape ecology. The results showed that from 2005 to 2015, the water conservation function of the Xiongan New Area first decreased and then increased, and the overall trend was upward. The increasing areas were mainly concentrated around Baiyangdian and near the grassland. Among all evaluated indicators, the precipitation compliance rate index fluctuated the most from -16.62 in 2010 to 6.70 in 2015. The evapotranspiration index was the largest in 2010 (6.47) and the smallest in 2005 (3.52). The Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) showed that the drought was the severest in 2010 and the least severe in 2015. However, the other indicators remain relatively stable. From the perspective of the spatial distribution, the water conservation function of the Xiongan New Area was gradually enhanced from north to south."
https://openalex.org/W3084111872,"Mitochondrial bioenergetics is dynamically coupled with neuronal activities, which are altered by hypoxia-induced respiratory neuroplasticity. Here we report structural features of postsynaptic mitochondria in the pre-Botzinger complex (pre-BotC) of rats treated with chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) simulating a severe condition of obstructive sleep apnea. The subcellular changes in dendritic mitochondria and histochemistry of cytochrome c oxidase (CO) activity were examined in pre-BotC neurons localized by immunoreactivity of neurokinin 1 receptors. Assays of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complex I, IV, V activities, and membrane potential were performed in the ventrolateral medulla containing the pre-BotC region. We found significant decreases in the mean length and area of dendritic mitochondria in the pre-BotC of CIH rats, when compared to the normoxic control and hypoxic group with daily acute intermittent hypoxia (dAIH) that evokes robust synaptic plasticity. Notably, these morphological alterations were mainly observed in the mitochondria in close proximity to the synapses. In addition, the proportion of mitochondria presented with enlarged compartments and filamentous cytoskeletal elements in the CIH group was less than the control and dAIH groups. Intriguingly, these distinct characteristics of structural adaptability were observed in the mitochondria within spatially restricted dendritic spines. Furthermore, the proportion of moderately to darkly CO-reactive mitochondria was reduced in the CIH group, indicating reduced mitochondrial activity. Consistently, mitochondrial ETC enzyme activities and membrane potential were lowered in the CIH group. These findings suggest that hypoxia-induced respiratory plasticity was characterized by spatially confined mitochondrial alterations within postsynaptic spines in the pre-BotC neurons. In contrast to the robust plasticity evoked by dAIH preconditioning, a severe CIH challenge may weaken the local mitochondrial bioenergetics that the fuel postsynaptic activities of the respiratory motor drive."
https://openalex.org/W3084446534,"A common barrier to entry for New York City (NYC) dog adopters trying to rent apartments is the breed label the animal shelter assigned to their dog, despite the fact the labelling is primarily based on intuition and appearance. Bideawee, a limited admission shelter with three locations in the greater New York area, including one in NYC, phased out breed labels from their adoption cards in December 2017. In this study, we evaluated the generalizability of previous findings, specifically, that the removal of breed labels from adoption cards affected length of stay. Moreover, due to Bideawee’s multi-location structure, this study provided a unique opportunity to compare variables across different shelter sites while having shelter administration practices held constant. Data from 16-month time periods before and after breed labels were removed was compared. The median length of stay of a dog at Bideawee decreased by 11.3 days (-37.3%) once breed labels were removed (Mdn = 19.0) compared to when breed labels were in place (Mdn = 30.3). A Mann Whitney test indicated that this difference was statistically significant (U(Nno breed labels = 1259, Nbreed labels = 987) = 386309.5, z = -15.41, p < .001). Dogs with a “green” behavior assessments (on a scale of green, blue, yellow, red) were almost four and a half times more likely to be adopted faster than “red” dogs (HR: 4.495, 95% CI 2.755–7.335, p < .001) before breed labels were removed, but only two times as likely to be adopted faster afterwards (HR: 2.220, 95% CI 1.514–3.254, p < .001). The return rate stayed constant across the two time periods at 6%. These findings provide new insights on dog adoptions in the NYC area and suggest that the removal of breed labels will help all dogs get adopted from animal shelters."
https://openalex.org/W3084517839,"Background We have previously shown that obeticholic acid (OCA) upregulates the biliary excretion of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an inhibitor of iNOS regulating the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Here, the effects of OCA on MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in liver, bile and serum were evaluated after hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Material and methods Male Wistar rats (n = 20) were orally administered 10 mg/kg/day of OCA (5 days) and subjected to a 60-min ischemia and 60-min reperfusion. Bile, serum and tissue were collected for MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity quantification. The MMP regulator tissue reversion-inducing cysteine rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), iNOS and biliary levels of LDH, γGT, glucose and ADMA were quantified. Results In the I/R group, OCA administration reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 in liver, bile and serum. A downregulation of tissue RECK and TIMPs, observed under I/R, were recovered by OCA. Immunohistochemical staining of hepatic tissue demonstrated that RECK expression is mainly localized in both cholangiocytes and hepatocytes. Hepatic iNOS positively correlated with tissue MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity. Biliary levels of LDH, γGT and glucose were lower in I/R rats treated with OCA; in bile, MMP levels positively correlated with LDH and γGT. Conclusion Thus, OCA administration confers protection to cholangiocytes via downregulation of biliary MMPs in livers submitted to I/R. This event is associated with hepatic RECK- and TIMP-mediated MMP decrease."

Individuals exposed towards HA hypoxia yields physiological and molecular orchestration to maintain adequate tissue oxygen delivery and supply at altitude. This study aimed to understand the temporal changes at altitude of 4,111m. Physiological parameters and transcriptome study was conducted at high altitude day 3, 7, 14 and 21. We observed changes in differentially expressed gene (DEG) at high altitude time points along with altered BP, HR, SpO2, mPAP. Physiological changes and unsupervised learning of DEG’s discloses high altitude day 3 as distinct time point. Gene enrichment analysis of ontologies and pathways indicate cellular dynamics and immune response involvement in early day exposure and later stable response. Major clustering of genes involved in cellular dynamics deployed into broad categories: cell-cell interaction, blood signaling, coagulation system, and cellular process. Our data reveals genes and pathways perturbed for conditions like vascular remodeling, cellular homeostasis. In this study we found the nodal point of the gene interactive network and candidate gene controlling many cellular interactive pathways VIM, CORO1A, CD37, STMN1, RHOC, PDE7B, NELL1, NRP1 and TAGLN and the most significant among them i.e. VIM gene was identified as top hub gene.

To reduce pain and stress in the affected knee joint compartment, a functional knee brace is often prescribed by physicians to protect it from high loads. Objectives An instrumented gait analysis should evaluate how the 4-point knee orthosis for varus or valgus load relief (M.4s OA) changes the kinematics of the knee, especially in the frontal plane. Methods 17 healthy participants took part and were analyzed with an inertial sensor system (MyoMotion) giving continuous, objective information on the anatomical angles. The measurements were made both without wearing a knee brace and with the brace in different settings. Results The results show a significant reduction in the maximum knee abduction and raised knee adduction. The knee brace, with a strong adjustment in varus or valgus orientation, caused a shift of maximum ab-/adduction in the proposed direction in 69% and 75% of the dynamic tests, respectively. The knee motion in the frontal plane shows individual movement patterns. Conclusion The use of the brace leads to significant changes in the knee’s movement. Patient-specific movement patterns may explain different effects of functional knee braces on individual persons. Inertial sensors have been shown to be a low-cost, easy-to-use option for individual movement analysis and further personalized therapy."

Unfortunately, many of these species were not re-encountered after their original description, and for the majority DNA samples were not available, making their phylogenetic position unknown. In this study, we assess the current state of the amphibians from Abra de Zamora, by: i. redescribing the species which were first reported from the area, by contributing genetic delimitation (for L. flavomaculatus, P. balionotus, P. colodactylus, P. percultus, and P. vidua), release call (L. flavomaculatus) and advertisement call descriptions (for P. balionotus, P. vidua and P. versicolor); ii. presenting an updated amphibian species list of Abra de Zamora, with the description of two additional Pristimantis species; iii. updating the distribution of these species, including data collected in similar montane habitats from surrounding areas; and iv. amending recommendations regarding their conservation status."
https://openalex.org/W3085126362,"Infection of wheat by Fusarium species can lead to Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) and mycotoxin contamination, thereby reducing food quality and food safety, and leading to economic losses. Agronomic management through the implementation of various pre-harvest measures can reduce the probability of Fusarium spp. infection in the wheat field. To design interventions that could stimulate wheat farmers to (further) improve their agronomic management to reduce FHB, it is key to understand farmers’ behaviour towards adapting their management. The aim of this paper was to understand the intention, underlying behavioural constructs, and beliefs of Dutch wheat farmers to adapt their agronomic management to reduce FHB and mycotoxin contamination in wheat, applying the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Data were collected from 100 Dutch wheat farmers via a questionnaire. The standard TPB analysis was extended with an assessment of the robustness of the belief results to account for the statistical validity of the analysis on TPB beliefs (i.e. to address the so-called expectancy-value muddle). Forty-six percent of the farmers had a positive intention to change their management in the next 5 years. The two behavioural constructs significantly related to this intention were attitude and social norm, whereas association with the perceived behavioural control construct was insignificant indicating that farmers did not perceive any barriers to change their behaviour. Relevant attitudinal beliefs indicated specific attributes of wheat, namely yield, quality and safety (lower mycotoxin contamination). This indicates that strengthening these beliefs—by demonstrating that a change in management will result in a higher yield and quality and lower mycotoxin levels—will result in a stronger attitude and, subsequently, a higher intention to change management. Interventions to strengthen these beliefs should preferably go by the most important referents for social norms, which were the buyers and the farmer cooperatives in this study."
https://openalex.org/W3085576498,"Salmonella enterica serovar Gallinarum (S. Gallinarum) can cause fowl typhoid, a severe systemic disease responsible for considerable economic losses. Chicken pathogenicity test is the traditional method for assessing the virulence of S. Gallinarum. However, this method is limited by several factors, including ethical considerations, costs, and the need for specialized facilities. Hence, we established a chicken embryo lethality assay (ELA) model to determine the virulence of S. Gallinarum. Three virulent and three avirulent representative strains, which were confirmed by the chicken pathogenicity test, were used to perform the ELA. The most significant difference between the virulent and avirulent strains could be observed when 13-day-old embryos were inoculated via the AC route and incubated for 5 days. Based on a 50% embryo lethal dose (ELD50), isolates considered to be virulent had a Log10ELD50 of ≤ 4.0, moderately virulent strains had a Log10ELD50 of 4.0−6.1, and avirulent isolates had a Log10ELD50 of ≥ 6.1. Different abilities to invade the liver of embryos were found between the virulent and avirulent strains by a growth curve experiment in vitro. The maximum colony-forming units (CFU) of the virulent strain was about 10,000 times higher than that of the avirulent strain in the liver at 5 days post infection. The ELA results of 42 field strains showed that thirty-two strains (76.2%) were virulent, nine were moderately virulent (21.4%), and one strain was avirulent (2.4%). In conclusion, these results suggest that the ELA can be used as an alternative method to assess the virulence of S. Gallinarum, which will contribute to the study of virulence genes, virulence evolution, pathogenic mechanisms and vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W3084942548,"Due to the rapid economic growth and the heavy reliance on fossil fuels, China has become one of the countries with the highest sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, which pose a severe challenge to human health and the sustainable development of social economy. In order to cope with the serious problem of SO2 pollution, this study attempts to explore the spatial temporal variations of industrial SO2 emissions in China utilizing the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime stable light (NSL) data. We first explored the relationship between the NSL data and the statistical industrial SO2 emissions at the provincial level, and confirmed that there was a positive correlation between these two datasets. Consequently, 17 linear regression models were established based on the NSL data and the provincial statistical emissions to model the spatial-temporal dynamics of China’s industrial SO2 emissions from 1997 to 2013. Next, the NSL-based estimated results were evaluated utilizing the prefectural statistical industrial SO2 emissions and emission inventory data, respectively. Finally, the distribution of China’s industrial SO2 emissions at 1 km spatial resolution were estimated, and the temporal and spatial dynamics were explored from multiple scales (national scale, regional scale and scale of urban agglomeration). The results show that: (1) The NSL data can be successfully applied to estimate the dynamic changes of China’s industrial SO2 emissions. The coefficient of determination (R2) values of the NSL-based estimation results in most years were greater than 0.6, and the relative error (RE) values were less than 10%, when validated by the prefectural statistical SO2 emissions. Moreover, compared with the inventory emissions, the adjusted coefficient of determination (Adj.R-Square) reached 0.61, with the significance at the 0.001 level. (2) During the observation period, the temporal and spatial dynamics of industrial SO2 emissions varied greatly in different regions. The high growth type was largely distributed in China’s Western region, Central region, and Shandong Peninsula, while the no-obvious-growth type was concentrated in Western region, Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan and Middle south of Liaoning. The high grade of industrial SO2 emissions was mostly concentrated in China’s Eastern region, Western region, Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou and Shandong Peninsula, while the low grade mainly concentrated in China’s Western region, Middle south of Liaoning and Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan. These results of our research can not only enhance the understanding of the spatial-temporal dynamics of industrial SO2 emissions in China, but also offer some scientific references for formulating feasible industrial SO2 emission reduction policies."

Linear and ordinal regression models were utilized to assess the relationships between the variables. Analyses were conducted by using SPSS at a 95% level of significance.We assessed 487 (Mean age: 38.8±7.1 years) nurses from three hospitals. Higher self-esteem was associated with a lower level of emotional exhaustion (Unstandardized coefficient: -0.579, p-Value<0.001); and a lower level of depersonalization (Unstandardized coefficient: -0.212, p-Value = 0.001). The relationship between self-esteem and personal achievement did not reach statistical significance. A higher effort-reward ratio was associated with less likelihood that nurses would consider their work environment favorable (Logit estimate of -0.832, p-Value = 0.014).Lower self-esteem is associated with increased burnout. A higher effort-reward ratio is associated with an enhanced perception work environment as unfavorable. We recommend psychosocial intervention programs and amendments in nursing policies to improve effort-reward imbalance among Chinese nurses."

Loss to follow-up (LTFU) was defined as an interruption of ≥ 6 months during follow-up. The re-engagement in care in PLHIV lost to follow-up before 31/12/2013 was defined as having at least one clinical visit after LTFU. The cumulative incidence rates of re-engagement in care was estimated by Kaplan-Meier and its predictive factors were assessed using Cox models. Socio-demographic characteristics, clinical and immune status, period, region, centre expertise level, and distance from home at the start of ART plus a combined variable of duration of ART until LTFU and 12-month change in CD4 count were assessed. Multiple imputation was used to deal with missing data.We included 3,650 PLHIV lost to follow-up before December 2013, starting ART in nine outpatient clinics and seven hospitals (5+2 in Bamako and 4+5 in other regions): 35% male, median (IQR) age 35 (29-43), and duration of ART until LTFU 11 months (5-22). Among these PLHIV, 1,975 (54%) were definitively LTFU and 1,675 (46%) subsequently returned to care. The cumulative incidence rates of re-engagement in care rose from 39.0% at one year to 47.0% at three years after LTFU. Predictors of re-engagement in care were starting ART with WHO stage 1-2 and CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/μL, being treated for ≥ 12 months with CD4 count gain ≥ 50 cells/μL, or being followed in Bamako. People followed at regional hospitals or outpatient clinics ≥ 5 km away, or being treated for ≥ 12 months with CD4 count gain < 50 cells/μL were less likely to return to care.Starting ART with a higher CD4 count, better gain in CD4 count, and being followed either in Bamako or close to home in the regions were associated with re-engagement in care."

Indeed, China is in a critical period of HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention and control; however, data regarding HIV testing, infection and coinfection among infertile couples are lacking. This study aimed to estimate the HIV/AIDS prevalence to identify risk factors among infertile couples in Hunan, China.A cross-sectional hospital-based study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of HIV/other infections (hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), syphilis, and Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) infections) among 338,432 infertile individuals in Hunan, China, from 2012 to 2018. We calculated linear trends in prevalence using bivariate linear regression.The overall prevalence rates of HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, MG, syphilis, and HBV and HCV antibody positivity in this study were 0.04%, 1.73%, 0.05%, 2.60%, 2.15%, 12.01% and 0.56%, respectively. The predominant infection was HBV, followed by MG, syphilis, and chlamydia. Only 1.13% of the participants (382/338432) reported sexually transmitted disease (STD) signs and symptoms suggesting genital tract infection. However, from 2012-2018, the variation in HIV prevalence was not significant (β = 0.000, PTREND = 0.907). The characteristics of the HIV-infected infertile population have not shifted dramatically, with women accounting for 32.56% of HIV cases in China. Overall, 87.60% of HIV-infected individuals have a relatively low education. In total, 37.98% of HIV-positive patients engage in high-risk behaviors.This study expands upon existing knowledge of HIV prevalence in the infertile Chinese population. However, much work is needed to achieve popularization of prevention knowledge and change concept. Routine HIV screening is urgently needed for all adults with high-risk behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3084387789,"Vitreous, a transparent tissue in our body, contains anti-angiogenesis factors. Our previous work reported that vitreous activates the signaling pathway of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which plays a critical role in angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine the role of EGFR in vitreous-induced angiogenesis-related cellular responses in vitro. Using a pharmacologic and molecular approach, we found that vitreous increased proliferation and migration via EGFR in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, we demonstrated that vitreous promoted tube formation via EGFR in HUVECs. Subsequently, depletion of EGFR using CRISPR/Cas9 and blockage with EGFR inhibitor AG1478 suppressed vitreous-induced Akt activation and cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in HUVECs. The significance of the angiogenic effect derived from vitreous demonstrates the importance of vitreous in the ocular physiology and the pathobiology of angiogenesis-related ophthalmic diseases, such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W3084952987,"It has been suggested that DNA methylation can work in concert with other epigenetic factors, leading to changes in cellular phenotypes. For example, DNA demethylation modifications producing 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are thought to interact with histone modifications to influence the acquisition of embryonic stem cell (ESC) potency. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is still unknown. Thus, we systematically analysed the co-occurrence of DNA and histone modifications at genic regions as well as their relationship with ESC-specific expression using a number of heterogeneous public datasets. From a set of 19 epigenetic factors, we found remarkable co-occurrence of 5hmC and H4K8ac, accompanied by H3K4me1. This enrichment was more prominent at gene body regions. The results were confirmed using data obtained from different detection methods and species. Our analysis shows that these marks work cooperatively to influence ESC-specific gene expression. We also found that this trivalent mark is relatively enriched in genes related with immunity, which is a bit specific in ESCs. We propose that a trivalent epigenetic mark, composed of 5hmC, H4K8ac and H3K4me1, regulates gene expression and modulates the nature of human ESCs as a novel epigenetic code."
https://openalex.org/W3085460459,"Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Thus, it is an important public health challenge worldwide. In Malaysia, only a few studies have focused on the trends of hypertension specifically for the aging population. In view of the rapid growth of the elderly population in Malaysia, there is an urgent need to explore the condition of hypertension in this aging population. Hence, the objectives of this study were to determine the trends of population mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) levels, the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension, and its' associated factors among older persons in two cross-sectional national surveys that were conducted in 2006 and 2015 in Malaysia.This was a subanalysis of secondary data collected from the two cross-sectional national population-based surveys conducted in Malaysia in 2006 and 2015. Adults aged 60 and older who had participated in these two surveys were included in the study.A total of 4954 (2295 males and 2659 females) and 3790 (1771 males and 2019 females) respondents completed the hypertension module surveys in 2006 and 2015, respectively. The mean age of the respondents was 68.5±6.9 years in 2006 and 68.6±7.1 years in 2015 and the difference was not significant. The prevalence of hypertension significantly reduced from 73.8% in 2006 to 69.2% in 2015 (p<0.001). Among the respondents with hypertension, the awareness, treatment and control of hypertension significantly increased from 49.7% to 60.2%, 86.7% to 91.5% and 23.3% to 44.8%, respectively, from 2006 to 2015. Logistic regression analysis showed that female sex and unemployed/retiree were significantly associated with higher hypertension prevalence in both 2006 and 2015. Being unemployed/ retiree was significantly associated with higher awareness of hypertension in both 2006 and 2015. In both 2006 and 2015, Chinese ethnicity were significantly associated with higher awareness and control of hypertension.The mean population BP levels and hypertension prevalence among the elderly population in Malaysia have reduced significantly over the past decade. Although the awareness, treatment and control of hypertension among older adults have improved significantly, the awareness and control rates remain suboptimal. As population aging is inevitable, appropriate public health programs and optimal treatment strategies targeting this vulnerable group are urgently needed to improve the overall awareness and control of hypertension and to prevent hypertension-related complications."
https://openalex.org/W3085548580,"Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is an opportunistic and potentially life-threatening infection of AIDS patients caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. jirovecii). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the most commonly used drug combination in the treatment and prophylaxis of PCP. However, with long-term use of this combination, mutations in the dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) gene of P. jirovecii bring about the development of resistance. Data on the prevalence of P. jirovecii and its DHPS mutants in China, especially in low endemic areas, are still limited. Thus, in the present study, we measured the P. jirovecii infection rate among HIV-positive and AIDS (HIV/AIDS) patients with suspected PCP and investigated the relationship between CD4+ T cell count and PCP occurrence. As well as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and sequencing, the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method was used to analyze DHPS point mutation in P. jirovecii strains. P. jirovecii was detected in 40.82% of cases. The clinical symptoms and signs of PCP were not typical; with decreasing CD4+ T cell counts, PCP infection in HIV/AIDS patients increased. In only one case (1.67%), the patients’ DHPS gene could not be cut by the Acc I restriction enzyme. Furthermore, mutation at codon 171 was detected in 11 cases and no mutation was found at codon 57. Patients treated with sulfamethoxazole combined with Voriconazole or Caspofungin exhibited favorable results. After treatment, the symptoms of dyspnea were alleviated, and chest computed tomography findings showed the improvement of lung shadows. These indicated that the prevalence of DHPS mutations in P. jirovecii isolates in AIDS-PCP patients in the region was low. Thus, the contribution of gene mutations to treatment failure requires further research."
https://openalex.org/W3085551196,"Theanine (thea) is a unique non-protein amino acid in tea plant (Camellia sinensis) and one of the most important small molecular compounds for tea quality and health effects. The molecular mechanism that maintains thea biosynthesis is not clear but may be reflected in complicated biological networks as other secondary metabolites in plants. We performed an integrative transcriptomic analysis of tea seedlings bud and leave over the time-course of ethylamine (EA) treatment that activated thea pathway. We identified 54 consistent differentially expressed genes (cDEGs, 25 upregulated and 29 downregulated) during thea activation. Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis of upregulated genes and downregulated genes showed that they may function as a cascade of biological events during their cooperative contribution to thea biosynthesis. Among the total cDEGs, a diversity of functional genes (e.g., enzymes, transcription factors, transport and binding proteins) were identified, indicating a hierarchy of gene control network underlying thea biosynthesis. A gene network associated with thea biosynthesis was modeled and three interconnected gene functional modules were identified. Among the gene modules, several topologically important genes (e.g., CsBCS-1, CsRP, CsABC2) were experimentally validated using a combined thea content and gene expression analysis. Collectively, we presented here for the first time a comprehensive landscape of the biosynthetic mechanism of thea controlled by a underling gene network, which might provide a theoretical basis for the identification of key genes that contribute to thea biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W3086500189,"In mammals, the fusion of two gametes, an oocyte and a spermatozoon, during fertilization forms a totipotent zygote. There has been no reported case of adult mammal development by natural parthenogenesis, in which embryos develop from unfertilized oocytes. The genome and epigenetic information of haploid gametes are crucial for mammalian development. Haploid embryonic stem cells (haESCs) can be established from uniparental blastocysts and possess only one set of chromosomes. Previous studies have shown that sperm or oocyte genome can be replaced by haESCs with or without manipulation of genomic imprinting for generation of mice. Recently, these remarkable semi-cloning methods have been applied for screening of key factors of mouse embryonic development. While haESCs have been applied as substitutes of gametic genomes, the fundamental mechanism how haESCs contribute to the genome of totipotent embryos is unclear. Here, we show the generation of fertile semi-cloned mice by injection of parthenogenetic haESCs (phaESCs) into oocytes after deletion of two differentially methylated regions (DMRs), the IG-DMR and H19-DMR. For characterizing the genome of semi-cloned embryos further, we establish ESC lines from semi-cloned blastocysts. We report that polyploid karyotypes are observed in semi-cloned ESCs (scESCs). Our results confirm that mitotically arrested phaESCs yield semi-cloned embryos and mice when the IG-DMR and H19-DMR are deleted. In addition, we highlight the occurrence of polyploidy that needs to be considered for further improving the development of semi-cloned embryos derived by haESC injection."
https://openalex.org/W3086305766,"China has a high burden of gonorrhea, but an imbalanced male-to-female (M/F) ratio of reported cases. Therefore, the prevalence of gonorrhea in China may be underestimated due to inadequate testing of potentially infected females. The objective of this study is to investigate the cause of this imbalanced M/F ratio and develop strategies to enhance gonorrhea surveillance, particularly among females.The national center for STD control (NCSTDC) of China CDC collected data in Zhongshan city over the year 2018 from the National Notifiable Disease Report System (NNDRS) and the Hospital and Laboratory Information Systems (HIS and LIS) that obtains information from 24 hospitals.Analysis of 1,542 reported cases of gonorrhea and the case distribution among different hospitals showed that most of the female cases (80.31%) were reported by gynecological clinics. The M/F ratio of reported cases varied between different hospitals and was dependent on the intensity of testing of females by their gynecological clinics.This study showed a significant correlation between M/F ratios and the relative contribution of female gonorrhea testing, especially in gynecology clinics. Enhancing gonorrhea testing among females should be advocated to improve surveillance in China."
https://openalex.org/W3086832609,"Intratumor Heterogeneity (ITH) is a functionally important property of tumor tissue and may be involved in drug resistance mechanisms. Although descriptions of ITH can be traced back to very early reports about cancer tissue, mechanistic investigations are still limited by the precision of analysis methods and access to relevant tissue sources. PDX models have provided a reproducible source of tissue with at least a partial representation of naturally occurring ITH. We investigated the properties of phenotypically distinct cell populations by Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) tissue derived cells from multiple tumors from a triple negative breast cancer patient derived xenograft (PDX) model. We subsequently subjected each population to in depth gene expression analysis. Our findings suggest that process related gene expression changes (caused by tissue dissociation and FACS sorting) are restricted to Immediate Early Genes (IEGs). This allowed us to discover highly reproducible gene expression profiles of distinct cellular compartments identifiable by cell surface markers in this particular tumor model. Within the context of data from a previously published model our work suggests that gene expression profiles associated with hypoxia, stemness and drug resistance may reside in tumor subpopulations predictably growing in PDX models. This approach provides a novel opportunity for prospective mechanistic studies of ITH."
https://openalex.org/W3084369683,"Virus entry into cells is the initial stage of infection and involves multiple steps, and interfering viral entry represents potential antiviral approaches. Ion channels are pore-forming membrane proteins controlling cellular ion homeostasis and regulating many physiological processes, but their roles during viral infection have rarely been explored. Here, the functional Kv1.3 ion channel was found to be expressed in human hepatic cells and tissues. The Kv1.3 was then revealed to restrict HCV entry via inhibiting endosome acidification-mediated viral membrane fusion. The Kv1.3 was also demonstrated to inhibit DENV and ZIKV with an endosome acidification-dependent entry, but have no effect on SeV with a neutral pH penetration. A Kv1.3 antagonist PAP-1 treatment accelerated animal death in ZIKV-infected Ifnar1-/- mice. Moreover, Kv1.3-deletion was found to promote weight loss and reduce survival rate in ZIKV-infected Kv1.3-/- mice. Altogether, the Kv1.3 ion channel behaves as a host factor restricting viral entry. These findings broaden understanding about ion channel biology."
https://openalex.org/W3085303721,"In spite of reliable and skilled healthcare resources, the prevalence rate of obstetric fistula in Uganda is high. The risk factors for obstetric fistula cut across due to high poverty rates and cultural barriers. The main objective of this study was to assess the impact of inability to access skilled healthcare at delivery and implications to the economy. The specific objective was to determine the best way of investment in getting women access to skilled healthcare before, during and after child birth. The question to be answered was whether it was more economical to invest in getting women access to skilled healthcare, or in expanding healthcare. The study was conducted using data from the Uganda Demographic Health Survey 2016. The data was from 18,506 women in the age group of 15-49 in 15 regions around the country. Results show that the highest investment in providing access to skilled healthcare is required when there are few skilled healthcare centres. On the other hand, if there is little investment in providing access to skilled healthcare during child birth, many skilled healthcare centres are required. Results show further that the minimum time taken to reduce fistula prevalence is attained when there are many women accessing skilled healthcare in the few equipped health centres. However, if there are many skilled healthcare centres but a few women treated for obstetric fistula, then it will take longer to reduce fistula prevalence. Fitting the model to data suggested that Uganda has a big backlog of women to treat for obstetric fistula as in all skilled healthcare centres, there were less women treated than expected. Although still under the expected figure, the benefit of these treatments for obstetric fistula is that for every one woman treated, 8 more would seek treatment for the condition. This would however cost the country a great deal in that the treatment funds would perhaps give more returns if diverted to outreach activities aimed to get women seek skilled healthcare during child birth."
https://openalex.org/W3085899772,"Contrary to the self-interestedness assumption, numerous economic studies have documented that people are intrinsically honest. However, little is known about this trait’s developmental origin. This study examines whether and the extent to which children in early childhood incur the intrinsic lying cost. We modified the commonly used coin-flip task into a child-friendly ball-drawing task with 10 trials and conducted the experiment with 225 child participants aged three to eight years old. We found that—although young children, on average, told two lies in the task (an average winning rate of 71%)—they lied significantly less than the maximum level (i.e., lying 100% of the time). The pattern was largely similar across gender and the age range studied. Furthermore, our child subjects’ propensity to lie dropped by approximately 9% when they were randomly assigned to the treatment condition with an increased “perceived” intrinsic cost of lying. Overall, our results align with the innate morality hypothesis: young children, as young as three years old, are willing to give up pecuniary rewards in order to remain honest."
