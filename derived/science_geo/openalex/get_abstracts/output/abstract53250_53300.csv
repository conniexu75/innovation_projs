https://openalex.org/W1490240728,"The variation with pH of the kinetic parameters of the reaction catalyzed by bovine heart lactate dehydrogenase has been redetermined with use of purified coenzymes. Although some of the values differ from those reported previously by Winer and Schwert, the kinetic anomaly observed previously persists in the present results. This anomaly arises from the fact that the rate of dissociation of the enzyme-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide complex, calculated on the assumption that the reaction follows a simple ordered pathway in which coenzymes must be bound before substrates can be bound, is less than the observed maximal velocity from the NADH-pyruvate side of the reversible reaction. This anomaly has been rationalized by assuming that at pH values below neutrality an unreactive protonated form of the enzyme-NAD complex is formed. Analysis of the results has permitted consistent values to be assigned to rate constants for every step in the reaction with the exception of the interconversion of the ternary enzyme-NAD-lactate and enzyme-NADH-pyruvate complexes. Silverstein and Boyer have concluded from measurements of the rate of interconversion of coenzymes and substrates at equilibrium that the reaction catalyzed by bovine heart lactate dehydrogenase follows a compulsory pathway at pH 7.9 but only a preferred order of combination with substrates and coenzymes at pH 9.7. An alternative explanation of the results obtained at pH 9.7 is proposed which is consistent with the reaction model deduced from kinetic parameters."

https://openalex.org/W1510526468,"Abstract Geranylgeraniol-2-14C has been prepared by a modified Witting reaction and converted to geranylgeranyl-2-14C pyrophosphate (17), which was purified by countercurrent distribution or chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose. An enzyme system from the endosperm of immature seeds of Echinocystis macrocarpa Greene catalyzed the cyclization of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to the tetracyclic diterpene kaurene. The enzymic activity, which is found in the 105,000 x g supernatant fraction, has been named kaurene synthase. It has a very sharp pH optimum at 6.6 and requires divalent metal ions, active in the order Mg++ g Co++ >> Zn++ g Mn++ g Cd++ ≥ 0 = Ca++, Cu++, Fe++. An assay for kaurene synthase is described, and a possible mechanism for cyclization of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to kaurene is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1575568920,"Abstract A procedure is described for the purification of a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-linked, d(-)-specific lactate dehydrogenase from extracts of Butyribacterium rettgeri. This procedure yields a 300-fold purified enzyme with a 28% recovery of the activity present in crude, cell-free extracts. The purified enzyme is inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents but does not depend upon reduced sulfhydryl compounds for catalytic activity. It is relatively insensitive to inhibition by oxamate. The enzyme actively catalyzes the reduction of pyruvate to lactate with NADH as the coenzyme, but it is unable to catalyze the reverse reaction under conditions where lactate dehydrogenases from other sources can be shown to reduce NAD+ with lactate. It does catalyze the reduction of the 3-acetylpyridine analogue of NAD+ with d(-)-lactate, although several other NAD+ analogues were found to be ineffective as cofactors for lactate oxidation. Kinetic studies on the purified enzyme suggest that it possesses at least two binding sites for pyruvate, which interact with one another in a cooperative manner. The availability of these sites or the interaction strength between them (or both) is markedly influenced by pH. At pH 5.8, the concentration of pyruvate required for one-half maximal velocity is substantially lower than it is at pH 7.5, although pH changes in this range have no effect on Vmax. The data presented are consistent with the hypothesis that the B. rettgeri lactate dehydrogenase is an allosteric protein which is potentially capable of being regulated by one or more physiological effector ligands."

Polymyxins B1 and B2 (refs. 1 and 2), polymyxins E1 and E2 (identical with colistins A and B, respectively)3,4, and circulin A (ref. 5) are now known to be cyclic decapeptides, each possessing a ring of seven amino-acids and a chain of three amino-acids attached to the ring at the α-amino-group of an αγ-diaminobutyric (DAB) acid component. As shown in the accompanying formula, differences occur in the nature of the accompanying aliphatic acid and of certain amino-acid constituents."

The electron spin resonance spectrum of the anion radical of I, generated electrolytically in solution, shows hyperfine structure that is due to two nitrogen atoms and four equivalent hydrogen atoms."

https://openalex.org/W2047436847,"WHEN bacterial endotoxin is injected intravenously into mice, an interferon-like vital inhibitor1 and lysosomal enzyme2 can be detected in the plasma. It was suggested that lysosomes are a major target of endotoxin in tissue damage3–5, and it seemed interesting to investigate whether the antiviral activity and the activity of a lysosomal enzyme follow the same pattern of appearance on injection of endotoxin. If this were the case, it would suggest that the viral inhibitor induced by endotoxin can also be released from lysosomes."

https://openalex.org/W2088747397,"ADMINISTRATION of adrenocorticotrophin in vivo increases the incorporation of 14C-glycine into protein by the supernatant of adrenal homogenates centrifuged at 15,000g1. A factor of the soluble cell fraction (105,000g supernatant) has been shown to be rate limiting for in vitro protein synthesis and its activity is doubled by ACTH administration in rats. This factor was reported to be proteinaceous; its elution pattern from DEAE-cellulose columns2 was identical with liver aminoacyltransferase3. The increased activity of the microsomal fraction by treatment with ACTH was reported to be delayed compared with the soluble cell fraction4. Thus it was of interest to find whether polysomes, which are polymeres of ribosomes and messenger-RNA5,6, or the protein from the soluble adrenal cell fraction were rate limiting for protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2039614854,"AUTOINTERFERENCE or autoinhibition is the phenomenon in which reduced multiplication of a virus results when a host is inoculated with a high concentration of virus. It has often been encountered in tissue culture cells with animal viruses. Members of the myxoviruses and arboviruses groups provide many examples1–4. These viruses can also induce interferon in the cells they infect. Interferon can be demonstrated in undiluted or low dilutions of culture fluids infected with virus used as inocula. Autointerference, therefore, has usually been attributed to the presence of interferon carried along with the inoculum. The present communication deals with an example of autointerference which results from the infection of chick embryo (CE) cells by Western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus. The results showed that interferon was not involved in this instance."

https://openalex.org/W1982181720,"ONE of the difficulties involved in elucidating the structure of an animal virus is to produce sufficient virus for investigation. Wheatley1 has shown that the yield of cells given by mice inoculated with Ehrlich ascites tumour could be increased by previous injection of a suspension of kieselguhr. Krebs ascites tumour cells, propagated in mice, can later be used for growing virus in vitro2. We show that kieselguhr can also be used to increase the yield of these cells, and furthermore, the latter resemble those produced in the conventional way in their response to virus infection. A simple method is thus available to provide larger quantities of cells for later virus investigations."
