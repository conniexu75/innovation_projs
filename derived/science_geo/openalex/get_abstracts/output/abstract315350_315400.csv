https://openalex.org/W2147240057,"Analyses of statistical distributions of body mass, population density, and size and shape of geographic range offer insights into the empirical patterns and causal mechanisms that characterize the allocation of food and space among the diverse species in continental biotas. These analyses also provide evidence of the processes that couple ecological phenomena that occur on disparate spatial and temporal scales-from the activities of individual organisms within local populations to the dynamics of continent-wide speciation, colonization, and extinction events."
https://openalex.org/W2007412320,"After a strong earthquake, the possibility of the occurrence of either significant aftershocks or an even stronger mainshock is a continuing hazard that threatens the resumption of critical services and reoccupation of essential but partially damaged structures. A stochastic parametric model allows determination of probabilities for aftershocks and larger mainshocks during intervals following the mainshock. The probabilities depend strongly on the model parameters, which are estimated with Bayesian statistics from both the ongoing aftershock sequence and from a suite of historic California aftershock sequences. Probabilities for damaging aftershocks and greater mainshocks are typically well-constrained after the first day of the sequence, with accuracy increasing with time."

Such problems arise in many areas including economics, physics, human and robotic vision, scientific and engineering computation, geophysics, decision theory, signal processing and control theory."
https://openalex.org/W2067438196,"There has emerged recently a new theoretical picture of the way in which patterns are formed in dendritic crystal growth and in the closely analogous phenomenon of viscous fingering in fluids. Some interesting questions that arise in connection with this theory include: How broad is its range of validity? How do we understand dynamic stability in systems of this kind? What is the origin of sidebranches? Can weak noise, or even microscopic thermal fluctuations, play a role in determining the macroscopic features of these systems?"
https://openalex.org/W1988278367,"Little is known about the effects of enriched CO(2) atmospheres, which may exist in the next century, on natural plant-insect herbivore interactions. Larvae of a specialist insect herbivore, Junonia coenia (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), were reared on one of its host plants, Plantago lanceolata (Plantaginaceae), grown in either current low (350 parts per million) or high (700 ppm) CO(2) environments. Those larvae raised on high-CO(2) foliage grew more slowly and experienced greater mortality, especially in early instars, than those raised on low-CO(2) foliage. Poor larval performance on high-CO(2) foliage was probably due to the reduced foliar water and nitrogen concentrations of those plants and not to changes in the concentration of the defensive compounds, iridoid glycosides. Adult pupal weight and female fecundity were not affected by the CO(2) environment of the host plant. These results indicate that interactions between plants and herbivorous insects will be modified under the predicted CO(2) conditions of the 21st century."
https://openalex.org/W2004157714,"Stishovite, a dense phase of silica, has become widely accepted as an indicator of terrestrial impact events. Stishovite occurs at several impact structures but has not been found at volcanic sites. Solid-state silicon-29 magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (silicon-29 MAS NMR) and X-ray diffraction of samples from the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary layer at Raton, New Mexico, indicate that stishovite occurs in crystalline mineral grains. Stishovite was indicated by a single, sharp resonance with a chemical shift value of -191.3 ppm, characteristic of silicon in octahedral coordination, that disappeared after heating the sample at 850 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes. An X-ray diffraction pattern of HF residuals from the unheated sample displayed more than 120 peaks, most of which correspond to quartz, zircon, rutile, and anatase. Eight unambiguous weak to moderate reflections could be ascribed to d-spacings characteristic of stishovite."
https://openalex.org/W2043727246,"The time and spatial dependence of the concentration of as few as 40,000 electrogenerated, redox-active molecules has been determined. The distance between generator and detector microelectrodes in an array used in the study could be varied from 0.8 to 28 micrometers. Measurements of a sufficiently small ensemble of molecules allowed the experimental results to be compared with a quantitative simulation of the random movement of each member of the ensemble. The transit time of an electrogenerated species from the generator to a collector microelectrode was measured as a function of viscosity, diffusivity, and distance."
https://openalex.org/W1980034248,"Landsat images of the Selima sand sheet in southwestern Egypt display alternating light and dark chevron-shaped patterns that occur downwind from low scarps and major dune fields. Images acquired between 1972 and 1988 indicate that these features move as discrete bedforms at a rate of up to 500 meters per year. Extremely long-wavelength (130 to 1200 meters), low-amplitude (10 to 30 centimeters) bedforms were measured in the field; the light chevrons seen in the orbital data may be thin accumulations of active sand sheet deposits in the lee of these bedforms. Dark chevrons contain an admixture of coarse-granule lag deposits that are continually winnowed by aeolian erosion on the windward sides of the large bedforms. Sediment transport budgets derived from orbital and field analyses suggest net movement of up to 83,000 cubic meters per year for a single light chevron; such measurements can be used as a check on similar calculations from dunes and other smaller scale features to determine sand transport budgets for large areas of the eastern Sahara."
