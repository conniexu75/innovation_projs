https://openalex.org/W2161835431,"c-Abl is normally regulated by an autoinhibitory mechanism, the disruption of which leads to chronic myelogenous leukemia. The details of this mechanism have been elusive because c-Abl lacks a phosphotyrosine residue that triggers the assembly of the autoinhibited form of the closely related Src kinases by internally engaging the SH2 domain. Crystal structures of c-Abl show that the N-terminal myristoyl modification of c-Abl 1b binds to the kinase domain and induces conformational changes that allow the SH2 and SH3 domains to dock onto it. Autoinhibited c-Abl forms an assembly that is strikingly similar to that of inactive Src kinases but with specific differences that explain the differential ability of the drug STI-571/Gleevec/imatinib (STI-571) to inhibit the catalytic activity of Abl, but not that of c-Src."

https://openalex.org/W2066998725,"The Bcr-Abl fusion protein kinase causes chronic myeloid leukemia and is targeted by the signal transduction inhibitor STI-571/Gleevec/imatinib (STI-571). Sequencing of the BCR-ABL gene in patients who have relapsed after STI-571 chemotherapy has revealed a limited set of kinase domain mutations that mediate drug resistance. To obtain a more comprehensive survey of the amino acid substitutions that confer STI-571 resistance, we performed an in vitro screen of randomly mutagenized BCR-ABL and recovered all of the major mutations previously identified in patients and numerous others that illuminate novel mechanisms of acquired drug resistance. Structural modeling implies that a novel class of variants acts allosterically to destabilize the autoinhibited conformation of the ABL kinase to which STI-571 preferentially binds. This screening strategy is a paradigm applicable to a growing list of target-directed anti-cancer agents and provides a means of anticipating the drug-resistant amino acid substitutions that are likely to be clinically problematic."

https://openalex.org/W2023569481,"The c-Abl tyrosine kinase is inhibited by mechanisms that are poorly understood. Disruption of these mechanisms in the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein leads to several forms of human leukemia. We found that like Src kinases, c-Abl 1b is activated by phosphotyrosine ligands. Ligand-activated c-Abl is particularly sensitive to the anti-cancer drug STI-571/Gleevec/imatinib (STI-571). The SH2 domain-phosphorylated tail interaction in Src kinases is functionally replaced in c-Abl by an intramolecular engagement of the N-terminal myristoyl modification with the kinase domain. Functional studies coupled with structural analysis define a myristoyl/phosphotyrosine switch in c-Abl that regulates docking and accessibility of the SH2 domain. This mechanism offers an explanation for the observed cellular activation of c-Abl by tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, the intracellular mobility of c-Abl, and it provides new insights into the mechanism of action of STI-571."
https://openalex.org/W2078725182,"Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), desmosterolosis and lathosterolosis are human syndromes caused by defects in the final stages of cholesterol biosynthesis. Many of the developmental malformations in these syndromes occur in tissues and structures whose embryonic patterning depends on signaling by the Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted proteins. Here we report that response to the Hh signal is compromised in mutant cells from mouse models of SLOS and lathosterolosis and in normal cells pharmacologically depleted of sterols. We show that decreasing levels of cellular sterols correlate with diminishing responsiveness to the Hh signal. This diminished response occurs at sterol levels sufficient for normal autoprocessing of Hh protein, which requires cholesterol as cofactor and covalent adduct. We further find that sterol depletion affects the activity of Smoothened (Smo), an essential component of the Hh signal transduction apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1996767070,"More than 5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor-allele frequency greater than 10% are expected to exist in the human genome. Some of these SNPs may be associated with risk of developing common diseases. To assess the power of currently available SNPs to detect such associations, we resequenced 50 genes in two ethnic samples and measured patterns of linkage disequilibrium between the subset of SNPs reported in dbSNP and the complete set of common SNPs. Our results suggest that using all 2.7 million SNPs currently in the database would detect nearly 80% of all common SNPs in European populations but only 50% of those common in the African American population and that efficient selection of a minimal subset of SNPs for use in association studies requires measurement of allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium relationships for all SNPs in dbSNP."
https://openalex.org/W2090189277,"Cultured primary human cells inevitably enter a state of replicative senescence for which the specific molecular trigger is unknown. We show that the single-strand telomeric overhang, a key component of telomere structure, is eroded at senescence. Expression of telomerase prevents overhang loss, suggesting that this enzyme prevents senescence by maintaining proper telomere structure. In contrast, progressive overhang loss occurs in cells that avoid senescence through the inactivation of p53 and Rb, indicating that overhang erosion is the result of continuous cell division and not a consequence of senescence. We thus provide evidence for a specific molecular alteration in telomere structure at senescence and suggest that this change, rather than overall telomere length, serves to trigger this state."
https://openalex.org/W1988293854,"Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a mental retardation syndrome associated with deletions involving chromosome 17p11.2. Persons with SMS have characteristic behavioral abnormalities, including self-injurious behaviors and sleep disturbance, and distinct craniofacial and skeletal anomalies. We identified dominant frameshift mutations leading to protein truncation in RAI1 in three individuals who have phenotypic features consistent with SMS but do not have 17p11.2 deletions detectable by standard fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2000070336,"Functionally similar neurons can share common dendrite morphology, but how different neurons are directed into similar forms is not understood. Here, we show in embryonic and larval development that the level of Cut immunoreactivity in individual dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons correlates with distinct patterns of terminal dendrites: high Cut in neurons with extensive unbranched terminal protrusions (dendritic spikes), medium levels in neurons with expansive and complex arbors, and low or nondetectable Cut in neurons with simple dendrites. Loss of Cut reduced dendrite growth and class-specific terminal branching, whereas overexpression of Cut or a mammalian homolog in lower-level neurons resulted in transformations toward the branch morphology of high-Cut neurons. Thus, different levels of a homeoprotein can regulate distinct patterns of dendrite branching."
https://openalex.org/W2046812435,"Previous work indicates that RhoA phosphorylation on Ser188 by cAMP or cGMP-dependent kinases inhibits its activity. However, these studies lacked the possibility to directly study phosphorylated RhoA activity in vivo. Therefore, we created RhoA proteins containing phosphomimetic residues in place of the cAMP/cGMP-dependent kinase phosphorylation site. RhoA phosphorylation or phosphomimetic substitution did not affect Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GTPase activating protein, or geranylgeranyl transferase activity in vitro but promoted binding to the Rho guanine-dissociation inhibitor as measured by exchange factor competition assays. The in vitro similarities between RhoA phosphomimetic proteins and phosphorylated RhoA allowed us to study function of phosphorylated RhoA in vivo. RhoA phosphomimetic proteins display depressed GTP loading when transiently expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. Stable-expressing RhoA and RhoA(S188A) clones spread significantly slower than mock-transfected or RhoA(S188E) clones. RhoA(S188A) clones were protected from the morphological effects of a cAMP agonist, whereas phosphomimetic clones exhibit stress fiber disassembly similar to control cells. Together, these data provide in vivo evidence that addition of a charged group to Ser188 upon phosphorylation negatively regulates RhoA activity and indicates that this occurs through enhanced Rho guanine-dissociation inhibitor interaction rather than direct perturbation of guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GTPase activating protein, or geranylgeranyl transferase activity.

The intracellular protein RhoA, a member of the Ras super-family of low molecular weight G proteins, regulates cell cycle progression, gene expression, focal adhesion assembly/disassembly, and the acto-myosin generated contraction and tension events of cell motility, matrix remodeling, and cytokinesis (1Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). RhoA cycles between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound state through nucleotide exchange and intrinsic GTPase activity. During cellular events of RhoA activation, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; cPKA, catalytic domain of protein kinase A; GAP, GTPase activating protein; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mant, N-methylanthraniloyl; RBD, Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin; RhoGDI, Rho guanine-dissociation inhibitor; ggRhoA, geranylgeranylated RhoA; PKA, cAMP-dependent kinase; PKG, cGMP-dependent kinase.1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; cPKA, catalytic domain of protein kinase A; GAP, GTPase activating protein; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mant, N-methylanthraniloyl; RBD, Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin; RhoGDI, Rho guanine-dissociation inhibitor; ggRhoA, geranylgeranylated RhoA; PKA, cAMP-dependent kinase; PKG, cGMP-dependent kinase. can bind and activate RhoA by promoting uptake of free nucleotide (2Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) negatively regulate RhoA by binding and stimulating GTP hydrolysis leading to an inactive GDP-bound state (3Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). RhoA signals within the cell by binding to a variety of effector molecules, such as mDia and the Rho kinases ROKα/ROCK2 and ROKβ/ROCK1 (4Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M.

Kikuchi A. Isomura M. Katayama M. Miura Y. Fujioka H. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 515-522PubMed Google Scholar). Prenylation of RhoA is required for promotion of cell growth, transformation, and cytoskeletal organization, indicating that membrane cycling is a critical component of Rho regulation (10Allal. C Favre G. Couderc B. Salicio S. Sixou S. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Lajoie-Mazenc I. Pradines A. J. Biol.

A primary mechanism of cytosolic sequestration of RhoA is through binding of Rho guanine-dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs) (11Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). RhoGDI contacts RhoA through two distinct domains, a flexible amino-terminal domain that impedes guanine nucleotide dissociation/hydrolysis and a highly folded carboxyl domain that stabilizes the RhoA geranylgeranyl moiety (12Gosser Y.Q. Nomanbhoy T.K. Aghazadeh B. Manor D. Combs C. Cerione R.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 814-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). RhoGDI is postulated to extract RhoA from membranes through concerted actions of both domains (11Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Administration of forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, or dibutyryl cAMP to cells stimulates morphological changes that are strikingly similar to those observed upon introduction of the Rho-specific inhibitor C3-transferase (13Lang P Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglia J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). From this initial observation, cAMP- and cGMP-dependent kinase (PKA and PKG) were demonstrated to phosphorylate RhoA on Ser188 (13Lang P Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M.

In support of enhanced RhoGDI binding, the ability of RhoA to cycle from membranes has been linked to cAMP and cGMP signaling within cells (21O'Connor K.L. Nguyen B.K. Mercurio A.M. J.

Functionally, constitutively active RhoA containing an S188A mutation is more effective in blocking actin dissolution promoted by dibutyryl cAMP (23Dong J.M. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22554-22562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) or 8-Bromo-cGMP (24Sauzeau V. Le Jeunne H. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Smolenski A. Lohmann S.M. Bertoglio J. Chardin P. Pacaud P. Loirand G. J. Biol.

On the other hand, the significance of RhoA phosphorylation to PKA/PKG regulation of its signaling is unclear considering recent reports. Thromboxane receptor stimulation promotes RhoA activation through a Gα13 and a PKA-sensitive pathway(s) (25Gratacap M.P. Payrastre B. Nieswandt B. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47906-47913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Manganello et al. (26Manganello J.M. Huang J.S. Kozasa T. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 124-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrated recently that PKA phosphorylates Gα13 subunit to promote βγ subunit uncoupling, thereby effectively shutting down receptor activation of RhoA. Moreover, PKG inhibited Gα13 activation of serum response factor transcription by impeding activation of RhoA (27Gudi T. Chen. J.C. Casteel D.E. Seasholtz T.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37382-37393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Notably, PKG also inhibited serum response factor transcriptional activity promoted by constitutively active forms of Rho kinase, protein kinase N, or protein kinase C-related kinase 2, indicating that PKG antagonizes RhoA signaling downstream of effector regulation. Thus, an emerging picture is that PKA/PKG negatively regulates RhoA at multiple levels. In this work, we expressed Ser188 phosphomimetic RhoA proteins, in the absence of constitutive RhoA activity and aberrant PKA/PKG signaling, to assess the contribution of PKA phosphorylation to RhoA function. We report here that addition of a charged group to Ser188 upon phosphorylation negatively regulates RhoA activity in vivo and indicates that this occurs through enhanced RhoGDI interaction rather than direct perturbation of GEF, GAP, or geranylgeranyl transferase activity. Materials—Puromyocin, bovine serum albumin, and buffer reagents were acquired from Sigma. Polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were purchased from Millipore. RhoA monoclonal antibodies (clone 55) were purchased from BD Biosciences. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Sigma)). Constructs—RhoA mutations (S188A, S188D, S188E, C190A) and RhoG mutation (S187A) were created through PCR mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and cDNAs were subcloned into either pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) or pCMV-Myc (Clontech) using EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. pGEX4T-1-RhoGDI (human) was created by subcloning RhoGDI cDNA into pGEX4T-1 using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. pPro-HT-Dbl (DH/PH) was a gift of Dr. K. Rossman, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC. Antibody Production—Antibody production and purification was performed by Covance Research Products Inc. Rabbits were immunized with a phosphoserine peptide containing the proximal nine residues of RhoA (RRGKKKPSGC) thiol bonded to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies were isolated by negative affinity purification with immobilized unphosphorylated RhoA peptide followed by positive affinity purification with immobilized phosphorylated RhoA peptide and low/high pH elutions. Fusion Proteins—GST-Rho fusion proteins (GST, GST-RhoA, GSTRhoG, GST-Cdc42, GST-Rac1, GST-RhoGDI) were purified from BL21 Escherichia coli cells (Stratagene) using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted with free and reduced glutathione in Tris-buffered saline medium (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and stored in 30% glycerol. His6-Dbl DH/PH was purified from BL21 E. coli cells using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose (Qiagen) and eluted with 20 units of tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. RhoGDI was produced by cleaving RhoGDI from GST-RhoGDI-Sepharose with 5 units of bovine thrombin (Sigma). RhoGDI was subsequently cleared with benzamidine-agarose (Sigma) to remove thrombin from incubation buffer. Recombinant geranylgeranyl transferase was purchased from Sigma. Phosphate-binding protein carrying an A197C mutation was purified and fluorescently labeled with N-[2–1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide as described previously (28Brune M.

Rho Protein Phosphorylation—To measure cPKA phosphorylation of Rho fusion proteins (see Fig. 1), 2.0 pmols of fusion proteins, 1.5 units of cPKA (Sigma), 330 pmols of ATP, and 3.3 pmols of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated in phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C for 20 min. Samples were removed, resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and then analyzed by autoradiography of dried gels. For large scale production of phosphorylated GST-RhoA, 120 μg (2.5 nmols) of GST-RhoA-Sepharose, 150 units of cPKA, and excess ATP (2 mm) were rotated in 1 ml of phosphorylation buffer for 90 min at 25 °C. Phosphorylation efficiency was estimated by scaling down reaction to 1% the amount of GST-RhoA and cPKA. Specifically, 1.2 μg (25 pmols) of GST-RhoA-Sepharose, 1.5 units of cPKA, 2.12 nmols of ATP, and 3.3 pmols of [γ-32P]ATP (1:645 dilution) were incubated in 10 μl of phosphorylation buffer with rotation for 30 min at 25 °C. Reactions were washed extensively, and incorporation of 32P was calculated and corrected with values obtained from GSTSepharose reactions. On average, 0.030–0.035 pmols of 32P was incorporated by RhoA into each reaction, indicating 80–90% phosphorylation efficiency ((645 × 0.03 pmol)/25 pmol GST-RhoA). To measure phosphorylation of geranylgeranylated RhoA, 2.0 pmol of unmodified or prenylated RhoA (see below) were incubated with 1.5 units of cPKA, 330 pmols of ATP, and 3.3 pmols of [γ-32P]ATP in phosphorylation buffer at 30 °C for 20 min. Samples were boiled to stop the reaction and then TX-114 was added to a concentration of 1%, and phase partitioning was performed as described previously for Rho proteins (29Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 46-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The detergent phase was washed with three 20-fold volumes of phosphate-buffered saline to ensure removal of non-prenylated RhoA. Both aqueous and detergent phases were aliquoted and analyzed for RhoA phosphorylation by measuring release of radioactivity and visualizing by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In Vitro Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor Assays—Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis of N-methylanthraniloyl (mant)-GTP (Biomol) incorporation into GDP-preloaded GST-Rho proteins was carried out using a FLUOstar fluorescence microplate reader at 25 °C similar to as described previously (30Leonard D.A. Evans T. Hart M. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12323-12328Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 2 μm GST-RhoA or 1 μm prenylated GSTRhoA was prepared and allowed to equilibrate in exchange buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1% glycerol). 500 nm mant-GTP and varying amounts of DH/PH (Larg, Dbl, or Dbs) or DH/PH/CRD (Vav2) protein were added at the indicated time, and the relative mant fluorescence (excitation = 360 nm, emission = 460 nm) was monitored. Experiments were performed in duplicate for every condition. GAP Assays—GAP assays were performed in a Spectramax Gemini XS fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices) (excitation = 425 nm, emission = 465 nm) at 25 °C by incubating 1 μm GTP-loaded GST-RhoA together with 2.5 μm fluorophore-labeled phosphate-binding protein in the absence or presence of 250 or 750 pm purified p190RhoGAP in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 1 mm MgCl2 at a total volume of 100 μl. Upon hydrolysis of GTP, the resulting free Pi is bound rapidly (1.36 × 108m-1 s-1 at 22 °C) and with high affinity (about 100 nm) by the phosphate-binding protein, resulting in a 13-fold increase in the fluorescence at 465 nm (28Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Because of this, the observed change in fluorescence corresponds to the rate and amount of Pi released from the GTPase. RhoGDI Competition Assays—2 μm of the indicated GST-RhoA fusion protein was incubated for 10 min in exchange buffer containing 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 μm RhoGDI to promote RhoA·RhoGDI complexes. Vav2 DH/PH/CRD and mant-GTP nucleotides were then added and allowed to equilibrate with mixing for 15 s, and the rate of mant-GTP incorporation was measured. Linear velocity of exchange was determined as described previously (31Arthur W.T. Ellerbroek S.M. Der C.J Burridge K. Wennerberg K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42964-42972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, baseline and GEF-induced nucleotide exchange rates were calculated by dividing the change in emission at 460 nm by change in time. Values were averaged and standard deviations were calculated for each reaction. Velocity was considered linear as long as the regression value of the exchange slope was greater than 0.97. Data from these and all other experiments were considered significantly different if the p values, as determined by two-tailed t tests, were <0.02. Geranylgeranyl Transferase Assays—GST or the indicated GSTRhoA-Sepharose (5 pmols), 100 pmols of 3H-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 0.36 units of geranylgeranyl transferase were incubated in Tris-buffered saline medium, pH 7.6, for 20 or 60 min. Samples were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and gels were fixed, incubated in Amplify solution (Amersham Biosciences), and then exposed by autoradiography. Alternatively, reactions were collected at 20, 40, 60, and 80 min in duplicate, washed extensively, and placed in scintillation buffer, and the extent of 3H-geranygeranyl was quantified. To generate geranylgeranylated RhoA for kinetic assays, 50 μg (1 nmol) of GST-RhoA or phosphorylated GST-RhoA were incubated in solution with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (25 nmols) and in the absence or presence of 10 units of geranylgeranyl transferase overnight at 30 °C. Proteins were either GDP-loaded (GEF assays) or GTP-loaded (GAP assays) and eluted with small volumes of free glutathione in Trisbuffered saline containing 0.25% deoxycholate. Through dilutions, reactions contained either 0.025% (GEF) or 0.015% deoxycholate (GAP). Unmodified RhoA (no transferase) was utilized as an experimental control for the influence of prenylation on GTPase activity (see Fig. 5, C and D). Transfections and Production of Stable Cells—NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells were transfected with the expression vectors indicated in each experiment according to the manufacturer's protocol using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen). After introduction of the expression vectors for 3 h, the transfection medium was replaced with growth medium for 16 h. For creation of stable cell lines, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with 1 μg of pPUR (Clontech) only or cotransfected with 0.05 μg of pPUR and 1 μg of pCMV-Myc RhoA construct and then selected in 10 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Clonal lines were established and screened for expression by Western blotting lysates with anti-c-Myc (clone 9E10; Sigma) monoclonal antibodies. RhoA GTP Profile Assays—The amount of activated, GTP-bound RhoA protein was measured using a technique similar to the method described by Ren et al. (32Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected or stable cells were lysed in 300 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors. 500–750 μg of lysates were cleared at 16,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was rotated for 30 min with 30 μg of GST-RBD (GST fusion protein containing the Rho-binding domain (RBD; amino acids 7–89) of Rhotekin) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Samples were washed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. GST-RBD pulldowns and lysates were then Western blotted with anti-c-Myc. To quantify GST-RBD pulldowns, Western blots of lysates and corresponding GST-RBD pulldowns from three unique experiments done in duplicate were scanned, and densitometry was performed using Metamorph imaging software. Calculation of Cell Spreading—For all experiments cells were replated in the absence of puromycin the day before experiments, trypsinized, washed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then suspended before plating for 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 0.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Suspended cells were plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips for 20, 40, and 60 min. Coverslips were fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue (2% Brilliant Blue, 45% methanol, and 10% acetic acid) for 10 min and then washed with water and mounted. The relative areas of individual cells from Metamorph images were quantified with the use of NIH Image software. At least 50 cells taken from 10 arbitrary fields were counted from each coverslip, with two coverslips counted for every condition. Immunofluorescence—Cells were plated and grown overnight on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips in the presence of serum. Cells were washed free of serum with serum-free medium and then incubated in serum-free media containing either Me2SO vehicle or 25 μm forskolin (Sigma) for 20 min. Cells were then fixed for 15 min in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline permeabilized for 5 min in 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Filamentous actin was labeled with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Images were obtained on an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss) using a MicroMAX 5-MHz cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instrument) and Metamorph Image software (Universal Imaging Corp.). PKA Phosphorylation of Rho Proteins—We confirmed that PKA phosphorylates RhoA on Ser188 (Fig. 1A) as described previously (13Lang P Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglia J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Although Forget et al. (19Forget M.A. Desrosiers R.R. Gingras D. Beliveau R. Biochem. J. 2001; 361: 243-254Crossref Google Scholar) demonstrated that PKA also phosphorylates Cdc42, we found Cdc42 to be a poor substrate for PKA in vitro, in agreement with an initial report (33Feoktistov I. Goldstein A.E. Biaggioni I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Further, Rac1 was not phosphorylated, whereas PKA efficiently phosphorylates RhoG on Ser187 (Fig. 1A), indicating that both RhoA and RhoG carboxyl termini are targets of PKA phosphorylation. The proximity of the Rho prenylation site (residue 190) to the site of PKA phosphorylation prompted us to examine whether prenylation affects PKA phosphorylation. Although RhoA is efficiently prenylated in our reactions (60–80% by molar incorporation of 3H-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate), phosphorylated RhoA or geranylgeranylated RhoA (ggRhoA) were subjected to TX-114 phase extraction. TX-114 phase extraction partitions prenylated RhoA into the detergent phase because of the hydrophobic modification (29Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 46-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), ensuring that ggRhoA will be specifically examined as a substrate. Phosphorylation efficiency of RhoA and ggRhoA was comparable (Fig. 1, B and C), demonstrating that prenyl modification of RhoA does not impede PKA phosphorylation. To measure cellular RhoA phosphorylation, we generated affinity-purified antibodies that selectively recognize phospho-Ser188 RhoA (Fig. 2A). Characterization of two unique antisera revealed that geranylgeranylation of phosphorylated GST-RhoA proteins abrogated antibody binding (Fig. 2A), indicating that the presence of a C20 isoprenoid moiety sterically blocks antibody recognition. Therefore, we elected to use NIH 3T3 cells that stably express Myc epitope-tagged-RhoA(C190A) to measure cellular PKA phosphorylation of Ser188. Forskolin stimulation of cAMP production strongly enhanced Myc-RhoA(C190A) phosphorylation as measured by Western blotting of whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitated proteins (Fig. 2B). We and others (32Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar, 34Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) have established previously that RhoA activity is reduced during the initial 15–30 min of cell spreading. Interestingly, PKA activity is transiently stimulated during the same time course (35Dormond O. Bezzi M. Mariotti A. Ruegg C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45838-45846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To address whether RhoA is a PKA target during spreading, cells expressing Myc-RhoA(C190A) were allowed to spread on fibronectin and at various times collected for immunoprecipitation with phospho-Ser188 antibodies. We observed that cellular phosphorylation of RhoA was significantly increased within the initial 20 min of NIH 3T3 cell spreading on fibronectin (Fig. 2C). These data support the conclusion that cellular PKA activity is elevated early in spreading (35Dormond O. Bezzi M. Mariotti A. Ruegg C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45838-45846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 36O'Connor K.L. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47895-47900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and indicates that RhoA is a target of cellular PKA regulation. GEF Exchange against Phosphorylated RhoA—GEFs bind GDP-bound Rho proteins and induce a transition state that promotes uptake of free GTP nucleotide, thereby stimulating Rho activation. It has been reported that cAMP inhibits GEF activation of RhoA in leukocytes (37Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24141-24144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), thereb"
https://openalex.org/W1981840277,"We investigated positioning of chromosomes during the cell cycle in live mammalian cells with a combined experimental and computational approach. By non-invasive labeling of chromosome subsets and tracking by 4D imaging, we could show that no global rearrangements occurred in interphase. Using the same assay, we also observed a striking order of chromosomes throughout mitosis. By contrast, our computer simulation based on stochastic movements of individual chromosomes predicted randomization of chromosome order in mitosis. In vivo, a quantitative assay for single chromosome positioning during mitosis revealed strong similarities between daughter and mother cells. These results demonstrate that global chromosome positions are heritable through the cell cycle in mammalian cells. Based on tracking of labeled chromosomes and centromeres during chromosome segregation and experimental perturbations of chromosomal order, we propose that chromosome specific timing of sister chromatid separation transmits chromosomal positions from one cell generation to the next."

Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Science. 2001; 294: 2559-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), have shown a common mechanism of TPP activation by (i) forming the ionic N-H···O- hydrogen bonding between the N1′ atom of the aminopyrimidine ring of the coenzyme and an intrinsic γ-carboxylate group of glutamate and (ii) imposing an “active” V-conformation that brings the N4′ atom of the aminopyrimidine to the distance required for the intramolecular C-H···N hydrogen-bonding with the thiazolium C2 atom (Fig. 1). Within these two hydrogen bonds that rapidly exchange protons, protonation of the N1′ atom of the aminopyrimidine system is strictly connected with the deprotonation of the 4′-amino group in that system and eventually abstraction of the proton from C2 and formation of the reactive 4′-amino-C2-carbanion (Fig. 1a) (10Kern D. Kern G. Neef H. Tittmann K. Killenberg-Jabs M. Wikner C. Schneider G. Hubner G. Science. 1997; 275: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This reactive C2 atom of TPP is the nucleophile that attacks the carbonyl carbon of different substrates used in the family of TPP-dependent enzymes. Within pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), the first catalytic component enzyme of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), this substrate is pyruvate (S1). The cleavage of the central Cα-C(=O) bond of this substrate proceeds from induction of the intermediate, 4′-imino-2-(2-hydroxypropionyl)thiamin pyrophosphate, i.e. lactyl-TPP (LTPP) (Fig. 1b), followed by conversion to 4′-imino-2-(1-hydroxyethyl) thiamin pyrophosphate (HETPP) with release of carbon dioxide (P1) (Fig. 1c). The fate of this active C2-α-carbanion/enamine HETPP differs among various TPP-dependent enzymes depending on the nature of the second substrate (S2). In E1, catalysis proceeds through reductive acetyl transfer between HETPP and lipoic acid covalently bound to the second catalytic component of PDC, i.e. dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) with formation of a transition state adduct (TATPP) (Fig. 1d) leading to the release of the second product S-acetyldihydrolipoamide-E2 (P2) (11Pan K. Jordan F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1357-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The deprotonation of the hydroxyl group at the C2-α carbon atom concomitant with the acetyl transfer to E2 brings the N4′-proton back to the aminopyrimidine moiety, and TPP returns to its active form to start the next cycle of catalytic reactions as presented in Fig. 1a. The E1 component of human PDC, designated E1p, is a TPP-dependent α2β2 heterotetramer with a molecular mass of 154 kDa, which has two catalytic sites, each providing TPP and magnesium ion as cofactors and each formed on the interface between the α and β subunits, where those interfaces are referred to as domains. The chemical equivalence of these two catalytic sites is distinct from the dynamic equivalence of these two sites. The dynamic nonequivalence of these active sites during catalytic action was first detected by spectral and kinetic studies of pigeon E1 (12Khailova L.S. Korotchkina L.G. Biochem. Int. 1985; 11: 509-516PubMed Google Scholar, 13Khailova L.S. Korotchkina L.G. Severin S.E. Biswanger H. Ullrich J. Biochemistry and Physiology of TDP Enzymes. VCH Weinheim, Blaubeuren, Germany1990: 251-265Google Scholar). The flip-flop mechanism was suggested, according to which two active sites affect each other and in which different steps of the catalytic reaction are performed in each of the sites at any given moment. The interactions between the active sites during catalysis and their dynamic nonequivalence are known from biochemical studies for several other TPP-dependent enzymes as well, including transketolase (14Kovina M.V.

Protein Expression and Purification—A prokaryotic coexpression vector of pQE-9-E1(E1α/HisE1β) was constructed encoding the 361-amino-acid residue sequence of human E1α with an additional 4 amino acid residues added at the N terminus, and separately, the 329-amino-acid residue sequence of E1β with an additional 12-amino-acid residue sequence at the N terminus (18Korotchkina L.G.

Selenomethionine-E1p derivative was expressed in methionine auxotroph DL41 cells transformed with pDM1.1 and pQE-9-E1 (E1α/HisE1β) vector and grown at 25 °C in medium containing 30 mg/liter seleno-l-methionine (19Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were eluted through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column and further purified by DEAE Sephadex A-25 and Superdex 200-HP chromatography with inclusion of 10 mm dithiothreitol at all times. In the final step, protein fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm TPP, and 0.2 mm MgCl2. Selenomethionine-E1p derivative was determined to be as active as the α2β2 wild-type E1p. The final preparation was ∼95% pure as judged by densitometry of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of the holo-form of E1p were grown from modified crystallization conditions described in Ref. 20Ciszak E. Korotchkina L.G. Hong Y.-S. Joachimiak A. Patel M.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar. Crystallization droplets consisted of 2 μl of protein solution at 17 mg/ml mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution of 200 mm NaSCN, 12% polyethylene glycol 3350, 10% 1,2-propanediol (v/v), and 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. For data collection, crystals were flash-frozen directly in liquid nitrogen and transferred to the x-ray beam for crystallography. A set of data at three wavelengths (λ1 = 0.97978, λ2 = 0.97962, and at high energy, remote λ3 = 0.96439 Å) for multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method was collected on a single crystal at the BM-19 Advanced Photon Source in Argonne, IL. Diffraction data were integrated and reduced with the HKL2000 program (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar) in the space group P 212121, a = 64.33, b = 126.89, c = 190.64 Å with E1p tetramer in the asymmetric unit. Structure Determination—The search for the structure of E1p included (i) multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method and (ii) molecular replacement based on the search model consisting of the reconstructed tetramer of the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (1DTW) with all amino acids replaced for the human E1p sequence. In the first approach, the search for initial phasing with the use of Se-Met data resulted in 35% of the total number of selenium atoms in the structure. In the second approach, the molecular replacement with MOLREP (22Vagin A. Tepyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4098) Google Scholar) gave a solution of both rotation and translation functions with the low correlation value of 0.20 and initial R factor of 0.57. The calculated electron density map using phases from the model was of poor quality with ∼30% of the main chain residues that were untraceable. After combining electron density maps derived from the Se-Met phasing with those from the molecular replacement, the core of this initial model was subjected to rigid body refinement. This first step of refinement was followed by slow cooling from 5000 K using the maximum likelihood function target and the restraints on the presence of the 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry in the model. After improving the electron density maps, fragments 1–29, 57–60, 127–129, 204–219, 245–248, and 272–345 from both α subunits and 30–35, 109–113, 177–193, 226–231, 280–285, and 304–310 from both β subunits were built de novo into the electron density maps. Subsequent rounds of model building and refinement were performed in XtalView (23McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar) and CNS (24Brunger A.T.

The E1p structure included coordinates for all 1380 amino acids of the mature protein and a total of four additional sequence residues located at the N termini of E1α and E1β subunits. The current model also includes 2 cis amino acids (Gly134 within both α subunits and Pro243 within both β subunits), 2 TPP molecules, 2 Mg2+ and two K+ ions, and 742 water molecules. The model was analyzed with PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 2: 283Crossref Google Scholar) showing 99.5% of the residues in the allowable regions of the Ramachandran plot except for Asp218 and Met200 from the α subunits and Arg239 from the β subunits. In each case, those residues have well defined electron density.

As shown in Fig. 2, E1p has four subunits, namely α and α′ (alpha subunits) and β and β′ (beta subunits), that are arranged tetrahedrally with the α and β subunits having their α′ and β′ counterparts related by non-crystallographic 2-fold. Each alpha subunit is composed of a parallel six-stranded β-sheet that is packed against 5 helices out of the total of 10 helices contributing to the content of this subunit. This β-sheet and the five helices are involved in binding of Mg2+ and the pyrophosphate fragment of TPP and are termed the PP and PP′ domain. Other specific secondary structure elements of the alpha subunits include the 28-residue N-terminal fragments and the 36-residue long C-terminal fragments, both being observed in extended conformations, and the 12-amino-acid helical fragment (274–285) found to involve phosphorylation in the alpha subunits (26Korotchkina L.G. Patel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5731-5738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The beta subunits, on the other hand, are composed of two similar sized domains corresponding to the N- and C-terminal halves of the 329-amino-acid polypeptide chain. The first domain of each beta subunit (residues 1–194) has a parallel six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by seven α-helices. This domain of the beta subunits is involved in binding the aminopyrimidine ring of TPP, and it is termed the PYR and PYR′ domain. The second domain of each beta subunit (residues 195–329), termed here the C and C′ domain, has a parallel four-stranded β-sheet with one edge comprised of an antiparallel β-strand braced with four helices, two of them on each side of this central β-sheet. It has been proposed, based on the studies of other heterotetrameric E1s, that E1p is bound to E2 of PDC through the C and C′ domain (1AEvarsson A. Seger K. Turley S. Sokatch J.R. Hol W.G.L. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 27Perham R.N. Patel M.S. Roche T.E. Harris R.A. Alpha-Keto Acid Dehydrogenase Complexes. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1996: 1-15Crossref Google Scholar). Additional structural elements in E1p are two K+ ions, one in each PYR and PYR′ domain of the β subunits, also shown in Fig. 2. Each K+ site is found at the negative end of the helix ranging from residue 150 to 162 (Fig. 3). Two pairs of symmetry-related K+ binding sites were first reported in the homologous structure of human branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (2AEvarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.T. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 277-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). One pair of K+ sites was in the place corresponding to the K+ sites found in E1p, and the other pair was placed in the regions of the loops in the alpha subunits (corresponding to loops 133–139 in E1p) that are involved in the cofactor binding and enzyme action. Both pairs of K+ binding sites were reported to have structural roles in stabilizing those particular loops (2AEvarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.T. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 277-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, only the K+ ions from the PYR and PYR′ domains have been confirmed in E1p. Rather, stabilization of loops in the alpha subunits in E1p is achieved by engaging Thr87 in a pair of hydrogen bonds with the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of Gly133 and Gly134 located in the cis-peptide bond between these two residues. Properties of the Subunit Interactions—In E1p, the PP and PYR domains of one α,β-heterodimer and the PP′ and PYR′ domains of the symmetry-related α′β′-heterodimer form predominantly hydrophobic contacts. This association of apolar portions of surfaces of the alpha and beta subunits is facilitated through the GΦXXG motif (where the Φ position is often a β-branched chain amino acid) by permitting a pair of helices, 140–155 of the PP domain and 59–72 of the PYR domain, and symmetry-related counterparts, to pack tightly together (Fig. 4, a and b). In the PP-helix, this GΦXXG motif has Pro143 replacing the glycine, Leu144, Gly145, Ala146, and Gly147, whereas in the PYR-helix includes Gly64, Ile65, Ala66, Val67, and Gly68. Both helices form a triad of close main chain contacts between Leu144···Ile65, Gly147···Gly68, and Leu144···Gly68 that range from 3.8 to 4.2 Å. Furthermore, in E1p, this motif extends beyond GΦXXG to Ile148 in the PP domain and Ala69 in the PYR domain, thereby adding a stretch of additional hydrophobic contacts between main chain atoms of Gly147···Ala69, Ile148···Gly68, and Ile148···Ala69 (4.4–4.9 Å). The GΦXXG motif is well known in membrane proteins and was first noticed in non-membrane β-subunit tetramers of pyruvate dehydrogenase from Pyrobaculum aerophilum (28Kleiger G. Perry J. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14484-14492Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Considering all interactions described above, it is suggested that these rigid connections of the PP with the PYR domain, and also their symmetry-related counterparts, are structural elements that promote formation of independent pairs of αβ-heterodimers and that are required in functional α2β2-heterotetramers. In the dynamic protein environment of E1p conducting catalysis, these rigid hydrophobic connections of the PP with the PYR domains are key structural elements required for a concerted movement of each heterodimer in its entirety. On the contrary, flexible connections between these tightly associated PP-PYR domains and their symmetry-related PP′-PYR′ domains are facilitated by two sites containing the cofactors, in such a manner that the aminopyrimidine ring of one cofactor molecule connects the PP with the PYR′ domain, whereas the aminopyrimidine ring of the other cofactor molecule connects the PP′ with the PYR domain. The pyrophosphate termini of each cofactor are nestled exclusively in the PP and PP′ domains by forming hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of Tyr89, the guanidinium group of Arg90, and the nitrogen atoms of Gly168 and Ala169 (Fig. 4c). The binding of pyrophosphate termini is completed by coordination to Mg2+ and by four hydrogen bonds with water molecules W2–W5 serving as proton donors. Completing coordination of Mg2+ is achieved through ligation to the main chain oxygen atom of Tyr198,to the side-chain Oδ1 atoms of Asp167 and Asn196, all being located in the PP domains, and to a single water molecule W1. The latter two amino acids are terminal residues of the 166GDGX26NN196 motif and are known to be present in all TPP-requiring enzymes providing the binding for this cofactor (29Hawkins C.F. Borges A. Perham R.N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The aminopyrimidine ring of each cofactor forms three hydrogen bonds: N1′···Oϵ2 of the carboxylate group of Glu59 (2.6 Å to both PYR and PYR′ domains), N4′···O of Gly136 (2.9 and 2.8 Å to PP and PP′ domains, respectively), and N3′···N of Val138 (3.2 and 3.3 Å to PP and PP′ domains, respectively). Val138 also acts as a structural wedge locked in between the thiazolium and aminopyrimidine moieties with contacts to Cβ and Cγ2 atoms varying from 3.6–3.9 Å in both cofactor sites. Uniquely, Glu59 is the first residue of each 59–72 helix of the PYR domains, and Gly136 and Val138 are the residues immediately preceding the beginning of each 140–155 helix of the PP and PP′ domains, all being involved in GΦXXG tight hydrophobic interdomain contacts (Fig. 4b). The carboxylate side chain of Glu59 is the local proton acceptor that enables the N1′ atom to react in the proton translocation within the aminopyrimidine ring, thus enabling deprotonation of the N4′-amino group of the cofactor as shown in Fig. 1. We postulate that in the dynamic protein environment, conducting this proton transfer from the N1′ atom of the cofactor to the protein and vice versa is accomplished by change of distances between the N1′ and Oγ2 atoms of Glu59. A search within the Cambridge Structural Database of small molecule structures determined by neutron and x-ray diffraction methods (30Allen F.H. Davies J.E. Galloy J.J. Kennard O. Macrae C.F. Mitchell E.M. Mitchell G.F. Smith J.M. Watson D.G. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1991; 31: 187-195Crossref Scopus (1378) Google Scholar) for N···O hydrogen bonds similar to that observed between the N1′ atom and Oϵ2 atom of Glu59 revealed that the proton is typically delocalized between the oxygen and nitrogen atoms in hydrogen bonds of 2.6 Å and shorter. On the contrary, longer N···O hydrogen bonds point to a deprotonation of the N1′ atom of the aminopyrimidine moiety, with that proton being transferred to the γ-carboxylate group of Glu59. These findings support our postulated proton translocation mechanism that is understood from the motion of the protein subunits. Considering all interactions of the aminopyrimidine ring and the dynamic protein environment conducting catalysis, it is suggested that the two triads of residues Glu59, Gly136, and Val138, one located in the PP and the PYR′ domains and the other located in the PP′ and PYR domains, can detect catalytic states of the cofactors to govern the protonation of the aminopyrimidine fragment, thus transducing catalytic action of E1p into movement of the pairs of helices connected by the GΦXXG motif. From this description of connectivity between the domains, it is interesting to realize that a channel at each access site to the cofactor can close or open to provide accessibility to either pyruvate (S1) or lipoyl moiety (S2), through a “shuttle-like” movement of tightly connected PP-PYR or PP′-PYR′ heterodomains. Flip-Flop Action of E1p—Although the crystal structure of E1p is static, i.e. derived from a crystal grown under conditions of cofactor-saturation in the absence of substrates, the kinetic model of enzyme action can nonetheless be inferred. The pattern of contacts among the catalytic domains supports structural rigidity and flexibility respectively required for a concerted shuttle-like motion of the heterodimers. We propose that this motion is the basis for the flip-flop action of E1p. Furthermore, the functional nonequivalence of two chemically equivalent active sites reported in spectroscopic studies (12Khailova L.S. Korotchkina L.G. Biochem. Int. 1985; 11: 509-516PubMed Google Scholar, 13Khailova L.S. Korotchkina L.G. Severin S.E. Biswanger H. Ullrich J. Biochemistry and Physiology of TDP Enzymes. VCH Weinheim, Blaubeuren, Germany1990: 251-265Google Scholar) can now be understood as two complete catalytic reaction cycles that are conducted separately in each cofactor-binding site, as shown schematically in Fig. 5. These catalytic reaction cycles are in alternate phases simultaneously involving pyruvate decarboxylation (TPP → LTPP → HETPP) in one site and reductive acetylation of lipoyl-E2 (HETPP → TATPP → TPP) in the second site followed by reductive acetylation of lipoyl-E2 in that one site and pyruvate decarboxylation in the second site. Starting with activated cofactor and pyruvate in the first active site formed, for example, between the PP and PYR′ domains shown in Fig. 5, the formation of LTPP intermediate causes the geometrical changes of the cofactor imposed by the presence of a bulky lactyl group at the C2 atom. Support for this hypothesis comes from the molecular modeling studies of Lobell and Crout (31Lobell M. Crout D.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1867-1873Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that detailed that the thiazolium ring rotates to remove steric hindrance and the carboxylate group rotates to maximize the overlap of the orbital containing the pair of electrons of the carbon-carboxylate bond with the π-electrons of the thiazolium ring of LTPP. These rotations induce a movement by ∼2 Å of Val138 wedged in the space between the thiazolium and aminopyrimidine rings, where that movement entrains the connected 140–155 helix with subsequent shift of the PP domain with respect to the PYR′ domain, which remains stationary. That shift of the PP domain causes entrained movement of the PYR domain, which has Glu59 bound to the N1′ atom of the cofactor of the second active site. This interlocked translational motion of the PP and PYR domains of the αβ-heterodimer along the stationary PP′ and PYR′ domains of the α′β′-heterodimer leads then to closing the channel to the first active site, thus isolating the site for the reaction of decarboxylation of pyruvate, which is followed by a cascade of temporally connected events in the second active site. These events are (i) opening the access channel to the second cofactor site so that the second substrate lipoyl-E2 can access HETPP to conduct acetyl transfer to E2 and (ii) extending the distance between the N1′ atom of the second cofactor and Oϵ2 atom of Glu59 of the PYR domain. The lengthening of the latter distance leads to translocation of the proton at the N1′ atom back to the Oϵ2 atom of Glu59 that is correlated with deprotonation of the C2-α-hydroxyalkyl group at TATPP, thereby promoting release of the second product S-acetyldihydrolipoamide-E2 (P2) to recreate activated TPP. It is interesting to note that this proposed shuttle-like motion of the heterodomains is driven by catalytic events occurring in both catalytic sites simultaneously, resulting in “pull-push”-like mechanics at the atomic level. The movement of Val138 that follows the geometric changes of the cofactor (TPP → LTPP) in the first active site acts to pull the domains in a discrete direction, whereas at the same time, the lipoyl-E2 substrate conducting catalysis in the second active site (HETPP → TATPP) acts to push the domains in the direction initiated by the motion of Val138. This concerted shuttle-like movement of the heterodimers provides an explanation for the flip-flop mechanism of catalysis. This also implies that this newly defined shuttle-like motion of E1p heterodimers ensures highly controlled depletion rates of both catalytic substrates. General Implications of E1p Structure for Flip-Flop Action— The structure of E1p is proposed as a model for action of other TPP-dependent enzymes because E1p shares structural components similar to other enzymes in this family.

Science. 2001; 294: 2559-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) also have pairs of the PP and PYR domains that provide for the two cofactor-binding sites, despite the fact that these domains can be distributed over two polypeptide chains as observed in the homologous α2β2 tetrameric branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases or over a single chain, or often separated by domains that provide other functions. The association patterns between the pairs of PP and PYR domains in these enzymes resemble those of E1p. These include tight hydrophobic contacts between the domains facilitated by the GΦXXG motif and rather flexible contacts between the domains providing for the cofactor sites. Structure-derived sequence alignment of the fragment of E1p that contains Glu59 in the 59–72 helix of the PYR domains and Gly136 and Val138 in the 140–155 helix of the PP domains shown in Fig. 4d revealed that glutamate at position 59 is unique to all TPP-dependent enzymes and that Gly136 and Val138 are not conserved throughout this family of enzymes. Analysis of structures of these enzymes reveals, however, that the residues occupying positions at Gly136 and Val138 have similar functions in forming hydrogen bonds to the N4′ and N3′ atoms of cofactors via their main chain atoms and in protonation of the aminopyrimidine ring that drives the flip-flop action. As regards the role of the side chain of Val138, this structural comparison reveals that the side chain of the residue at the position of Val138 acts as a structural wedge located between the thiazolium and aminopyrimidine rings, thereby providing hydrophobic interactions to both ring systems. Therefore, we conclude that all TPP-dependent enzymes have common structural elements needed for shuttle-like motion of the domains that can support dynamic nonequivalence of otherwise chemically equivalent cofactor binding sites. Finally, E1p is a dynamic molecular machine scanning the entrance to the binding sites centered on the C2 atom for substrate-accessibility, i.e. pyruvate and lipoyl moiety of E2 (lipoamide), accepting them when required and processing them with the release of products. In conclusion, E1p provides an understanding of how this enzyme can use domain movements to select and process particular substrates during its catalytic cycle within a crowded environment such as the mitochondrial matrix.

The Chk2 protein kinase has been hypothesized to be the primary mediator of this response. We have rigorously tested this hypothesis in human cells by disrupting the CHK2 gene through homologous recombination. We found that the p53 response was unexpectedly robust in such cells. Phosphorylation of p53 at serine 20, accumulation of p53 protein, transcriptional activation of p53 target genes, and cell cycle arrest and apoptotic death phenotypes were completely intact regardless of CHK2 status.

Our results indicate that Chk2 kinase is not required for p53 activation in human cells and explain why CHK2 and TP53 mutations can jointly occur in human tumors. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a central mediator of the cellular response to DNA damage and other forms of stress and is inactivated in the majority of human cancers (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar). Upon exposure of cells to ionizing radiation (IR), 1The abbreviations used are: IR, ionizing radiation; LFLS, Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome; LFS, Li-Fraumeni syndrome; 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; FDXR, ferredoxin reductase. the p53 protein is stabilized and activates transcription of downstream target genes that implement cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (2Zhao R.

Biol. 2001; 3: E277-E286Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This activation is tightly coupled to phosphorylation of a number of key residues, particularly at the amino terminus (4Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar, 5Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these residues is thought to block the interaction of p53 with MDM2 (6Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a ubiquitin-protein ligase that normally targets p53 for rapid turnover and thus suppresses its accumulation in undamaged cells (7Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7637-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Although the relative importance of individual residues to p53 activation remains under active study, phosphorylation of serine 20 appears to be essential for p53 stabilization (8Chehab N.H.

J. 2001; 359: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Upstream serine/threonine kinases that perform this phosphorylation are believed to be essential components of the signaling pathway that leads to the post-transcriptional activation of p53. Among the cellular kinases that can phosphorylate p53 at serine 20 is the product of the CHK2 gene (6Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is mutated in a subset of kindreds with the Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFLS) (11Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H.

LFLS overlaps clinically with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a cancer-prone disease caused by inherited mutations in the TP53 gene. The DNA damage-dependent activation of Chk2 kinase, in turn, has been found to require the kinase activity of ATM (13Canman C.E. Wolff A.C. Chen C.Y. Fornace Jr., A.J. Kastan M.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5054-5058PubMed Google Scholar, 14Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 15Ahn J.Y. Schwarz J.K.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936PubMed Google Scholar), encoded by the gene that is defective in patients with another inherited cancer syndrome called ataxia telangiectasia (16Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar). Taken together, the cancer-prone phenotypes of kindreds with mutations in the ATM, CHK2, or TP53 genes and the biochemical data have given rise to the idea that these genes function along a linear pathway in mammalian cells (17Bartek J. Falck J. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In support of this model, IR-dependent activation of Chk2 kinase and up-regulation of p53 are both defective in fibroblasts derived from ataxia telangiectasia patients and in murine ATM–/– cells (16Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that IR fails to activate p53-dependent transcription in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in Chk2 (18Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). However, re-examination of these MEFs (19Jack M.T. Woo R.A. Hirao A. Cheung A. Mak T.W. Lee P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9825-9829Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and independently derived MEFs (20Takai H. Naka K. Okada Y. Watanabe M. Harada N.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) has led to somewhat different conclusions. A recent study of the relationship between the homologs of CHK2 and TP53 in Drosophila, DmCHK2, and DmP53, respectively, has shown that DmChk2 activity is required for Dmp53-mediated apoptosis (21Peters M. DeLuca C. Hirao A. Stambolic V. Potter J. Zhou L. Liepa J. Snow B. Arya S. Wong J. Bouchard D. Binari R. Manoukian A.S. Mak T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11305-11310Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Evolutionary conservation of the regulation of p53 function by Chk2 would support the idea that Chk2 is required for p53 responses in human cells. Although the model of a linear ATM-Chk2-p53 pathway is attractive, recent studies of CHK2 and TP53 mutations in human cancers prompted us to evaluate this model in human cells. In particular, the most frequent CHK2 variant described in LFLS kindreds, the 1110delC mutation, is also found in ∼ 1% of the total population and thus must be a very low penetrance allele (22Meijers-Heijboer H. van den Ouweland A. Klijn J. Wasielewski M. de Snoo A. Oldenburg R. Hollestelle A. Houben M. Crepin E. van Veghel-Plandsoen M. Elstrodt F. van Duijn C. Bartels C. Meijers C. Schutte M. McGuffog L. Thompson D. Easton D.

By contrast, germline TP53 mutations are invariably high penetrance alleles that result in the severe cancer predisposition phenotype typical of LFS. In addition, the linear pathway model predicts an epistatic relationship between CHK2 and TP53, i.e. mutation of both genes in a single tumor should be extremely rare, as rare as concurrent alterations in APC and CTNNB1 (β-catenin) (23Sparks A.B.

Alternatively, if CHK2 is not required for, but only partially contributes to, p53 stabilization, the coincidence of mutations in TP53 and CHK2 might not be unexpected. The finding of a partial requirement of Chk2 in a non-linear p53 stabilization pathway would make it difficult to understand how CHK2 mutation alone might cause the marked phenotype of LFLS. To evaluate the contribution of human Chk2 kinase to p53 responses in an unambiguous manner, we chose to examine human colorectal cancer cells in which CHK2 had been disrupted through gene targeting, as described below. Cell Culture—The human colon cancer cell lines HCT116, DLD-1, and their derivatives were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Stably transfected clones were initially selected with either Geneticin or hygromycin as appropriate, then routinely propagated in the absence of selective drugs. Targeted Deletion of the Human CHK2 Locus—The targeting constructs pCHK2ex6a and pCHK2ex6b.1 were made by PCR, using bacterial artificial chromosome clone RP11–444G7 (Research Genetics) as the template. Homology regions were cloned into a bipartite gene-targeting system that has an additional recombination site designed into the neomycin resistance gene (30Jallepalli P.V. Waizenegger I.C. Bunz F. Langer S. Speicher M.R. Peters J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Lengauer C. Cell. 2001; 105: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Transfection, selection, and PCR screening were performed as described (30Jallepalli P.V. Waizenegger I.C. Bunz F. Langer S. Speicher M.R. Peters J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Lengauer C. Cell. 2001; 105: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) using Chk2–43 (denoted as a in Fig. 1B) and NEOreverse primers. Following isolation of heterozygous targeted clones the neomycin-resistance gene was excised by infection with an adenovirus expressing cre recombinase. A second round of gene targeting was then performed, yielding three independently isolated clones in which both alleles of CHK2 had been disrupted. All clones gave identical results in the experiments reported here. Details of the vector design and sequences of all PCR primers are available from the authors upon request. Irradiation and Drug Treatment—Cells were grown as subconfluent monolayers in T-25 flasks and exposed to a 137Cs source that delivered a measured dose of 0.8 Gy/min. Where indicated, nocodazole was added to the cell culture medium at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml immediately following irradiation. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was used at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Immunoblotting and Northern Blotting—In preparation for immunoblotting, cells were harvested and lysed in HB2 buffer as described (30Jallepalli P.V. Waizenegger I.C. Bunz F. Langer S. Speicher M.R. Peters J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Lengauer C. Cell. 2001; 105: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were resolved via SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Antibodies specific for Chk2 and Chk1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phosphoepitope-specific antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Electrophoresis and hybridization of total RNA was performed as described (31Hwang P.M. Bunz F. Yu J. Rago C. Chan T.A. Murphy M.P. Kelso G.F. Smith R.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat Med. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were collected by incubation in trypsin/EDTA, pelleted by centrifugation, and fixed in a solution containing 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in phosphate-buffered saline. 10,000 cells were analyzed per sample on a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Mitotic indices were determined by visual scoring of at least 300 nuclei. To develop a system in which Chk2 could be systematically studied in human cells, we deleted both alleles of the CHK2 gene in HCT116 cells through homologous recombination. The HCT116 colon cancer cell line is a useful system to study the effects of Chk2 upon p53 activation. It has been demonstrated that endogenous Chk2 kinase is activated in HCT116 cells following IR treatment (32Yu Q. La Rose J. Zhang H. Takemura H. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5743-5748PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the p53-dependent phenotypes of HCT116 cells have been examined in detail. These cells exhibit intact G1/S and G2/M checkpoints following DNA damage (33Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted deletion of p53 itself (34Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar) or its target genes p21 and 14–3-3σ abrogates one or both of these checkpoints (35Chan T.A. Hwang P.M. Hermeking H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1584-1588PubMed Google Scholar), confirming the integrity of the DNA damage response pathway and its dependence on p53 in the parent HCT116 cells. Examination of the CHK2 genomic locus revealed a total of 15 exons, including a previously unreported exon that lies upstream of the first coding exon. The targeting constructs were designed so that 160 bp of genomic sequence within the encoded kinase homology domain was deleted upon homologous recombination (Fig. 1A). Because a number of CHK2-related pseudogenes containing significant homology to exons 12–15 have been identified (36Sodha N. Williams R. Mangion J. Bullock S.L. Yuille M.R. Eeles R.A. Science. 2000; 289: 359Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we intentionally restricted our targeting strategy to the proximal exons (Fig. 1B). Even if the resulting allele were expressed, it would encode a truncated protein that would be predicted to be catalytically inactive. Two sequential rounds of targeting were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Successful targeting of both CHK2 alleles was initially assessed by PCR and confirmed in multiple independent clones by genomic Southern blotting (Fig. 1C). In these clones, no Chk2 protein, either full-length or truncated, was detected using three different antibodies directed against the amino terminus of Chk2, including one that recognizes phosphorylation of threonine 68 and thus would be expected to detect the presence of a truncated phosphoprotein if it had been present (Fig. 2A). Following exposure to DNA damaging agents such as IR, parental HCT116 cells undergo growth arrest in the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle (33Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar), as is typical of many cell types that harbor wild type p53. Within one hour after IR treatment, activated upstream kinases phosphorylate p53 and Chk2 in a fashion similar to that of other cell types that have been described (Fig. 2, A and B). This phosphorylation is accompanied by a sustained and dramatic accumulation of p53 protein over a period of several hours (Fig. 2B). Pretreatment of cells with caffeine prevents both serine 20 phosphorylation and p53 stabilization in response to IR (37Xie S. Wang Q. Wu H. Cogswell J. Lu L. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36194-36199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that these events are functionally linked. Notably, in CHK2–/– cells, p53 accumulated to high levels with time (Fig. 2B). In addition, this accumulation of p53 was accompanied by robust phosphorylation of p53 on serine 20 (Fig. 2C). The kinetics and amplitude of these responses were essentially identical in CHK2–/– cells and their isogenic wild type controls. Robust induction of p53 was evident within3hof exposure to 12 Gy of IR (Fig. 2B). We took advantage of this observation to determine whether CHK2–/– cells could up-regulate p53 levels in response to lower doses of IR. Throughout the broad range of doses, p53 was consistently induced to a similar extent, regardless of CHK2 status (Fig. 2D). IR-mediated activation of p53 results in transcriptional activation of downstream target genes. The most well known of these p53 targets is the p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which participates in the G1 and G2 arrest phenotypes associated with wild type p53 function (34Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). We found that p21 was induced to equivalent levels in wild type and Chk2-deficient cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that p53 was not only stabilized by IR but also functioned as a transcriptional activator. One of the most important results of p53 deficiency is the failure to implement cell cycle checkpoints. Following IR treatment, we observed a clear diminution of cells in S phase in both CHK2+/+ and CHK2–/– cells. Cells arrested into stable populations with either 2N or 4N DNA content, regardless of genotype. These results indicated that the G1/S checkpoint was intact despite the lack of Chk2 protein (Fig. 3A). We performed several experiments to evaluate the ability of CHK2–/– cells to initiate and maintain a G2 arrest following IR. First, we measured the ability of irradiated cells to block entry into mitosis immediately following IR treatment. Initiation of this pre-mitotic block is thought to be mediated by phosphorylation of the Cdc25C phosphatase on serine 216, which sequesters Cdc25C in the cytoplasm and prevents activation of mitotic cyclin B/Cdc2 kinase in irradiated cells (38Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). In vitro, Cdc25C can be phosphorylated on this site by either Chk2 or Chk1 kinases (14Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 39Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Schwarz J.K. Mitiku N. Piwnica-Worms H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3745-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Within 1 h of IR exposure, both CHK2+/+ and CHK2–/– cells had phosphorylated Cdc25C on serine 216 (Fig. 2A) and blocked entry into mitosis (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that the ability to initiate G2 arrest is independent of CHK2 status. To assess the long-term maintenance of this G2 arrest, we incubated IR-treated cells in the presence of nocodazole. We previously showed that p53-deficient cells fail to maintain the G2 checkpoint after IR treatment and eventually progress into mitosis (34Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). In contrast, however, very few Chk2-deficient cells entered mitosis, similar to wild type cells (Fig. 3C). We conclude that the maintenance of the G2 cell cycle checkpoint was unaffected by targeting CHK2, even though this checkpoint was markedly altered in HCT116 cells in which the TP53 gene had been analogously targeted (34Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). The activation of p53 under certain conditions results in apoptosis rather than growth arrest (40Vousden K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). In HCT116 cells, the apoptotic response is strongly elicited by the chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU (41Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), the mainstay of colorectal cancer chemotherapy. This apoptotic response is absolutely dependent on functional p53 (41Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) and its downstream transcriptional target, ferredoxin reductase (FDXR) (31Hwang P.M. Bunz F. Yu J. Rago C. Chan T.A. Murphy M.P. Kelso G.F. Smith R.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat Med. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In both CHK2+/+ and CHK2–/– cells, 5-FU exposure triggered the phosphorylation of serine 20 and a dramatic accumulation of p53 protein (Fig. 4B). The end result was strong up-regulation of FDXR transcripts and high levels of apoptotic cell death (Fig. 4A) in both wild type and Chk2-deficient cells. Finally, we wished to determine whether these results were applicable to other colorectal cancer cell lines. Though generation of other knock-out lines would not have been feasible in a reasonable time frame, some information could be gained through the examination of DLD-1 cells. This human colorectal cell line contains one CHK2 allele with an inactivating point mutation (R145W), whereas the other allele is transcriptionally silenced, rendering the cells Chk2 deficient (11Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C. Shannon K.E. Lubratovich M. Verselis S.J. Isselbacher K.J. Fraumeni J.F. Birch J.M. Li F.P. Garber J.E. Haber D.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2528-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 29Falck J. Lukas C. Protopopova M. Lukas J. Selivanova G. Bartek J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5503-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Serine 20 phosphorylation of the endogenous mutant p53 protein in this line was easily detectable after IR exposure (Fig. 2E). Moreover, we introduced a Chk2 expression vector into the line and established subclones of DLD-1 that produced high levels of Chk2, comparable with that observed in HCT116 cells. The phosphorylation of p53 serine 20 was not increased in these subclones (Fig. 2E), arguing that Chk2 is not the physiologically limiting kinase responsible for phosphorylation at this site. The results described above are quite different from what we expected based on the phenotype of Chk2-deficient mouse cells (18Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). In particular, Chk2 disruption in human cells did not lead to defects in p53 stabilization, phosphorylation, or transcriptional activation of downstream targets, or to defects in G1/S or G2 checkpoints or apoptotic induction at the physiologic level. Why are the results we have obtained so different from those previously described in mice? We presume these differences are due to the different cell types and species examined. For example, we studied neoplastic epithelial cells in humans, whereas previous studies (18Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 19Jack M.T. Woo R.A. Hirao A. Cheung A. Mak T.W. Lee P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9825-9829Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) focused on normal thymocytes or embryonic cells of murine origin. Further studies will be necessary to distinguish which of these differences are the most critical. Regardless, our results rigorously show that at least some human cells (and perhaps all) do not require Chk2 to activate p53 pathways for growth control and that no simple linear model connecting ATM to Chk2 to p53 can be generally applicable. It has recently been suggested that Chk2 activation may require a functional mismatch repair system (42Brown K.D. Rathi A. Kamath R. Beardsley D.I. Zhan Q. Mannino J.L. Baskaran R. Nat. Genet. 2002; 25: 25Google Scholar). However, independent assessments performed in multiple laboratories (10Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Falck J. Lukas C. Protopopova M. Lukas J. Selivanova G. Bartek J.

Webster S.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2971-2974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Chk2 is robustly activated in human cancer cells that have been exposed to DNA damage, irrespective of mismatch repair status. Furthermore, mismatch repair-deficient cancer cell lines clearly respond to DNA damage exposure with a sustained G2 checkpoint arrest that requires both p53 and its downstream target, the p21 CDK inhibitor (34Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that mismatch repair-deficient cells are competent for the biochemical activation of both Chk2 kinase and the transcriptional upregulation of p53-regulated target genes. Our genetic analysis indicates that Chk2 is not required for p53 responses in human cells. One might initially interpret our results as suggesting that another kinase substitutes for Chk2 and activates p53 in human cells, but not in mouse or insect cells (18Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 21Peters M. DeLuca C. Hirao A. Stambolic V. Potter J. Zhou L. Liepa J. Snow B. Arya S. Wong J. Bouchard D. Binari R. Manoukian A.S. Mak T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11305-11310Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), that lack Chk2. However, it has recently been discovered that Chk2 kinase purified from IR-treated human cells phosphorylates p53 very poorly in vitro (44Ahn J. Urist M. Prives C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20480-20489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Taken together, these genetic and biochemical data support an alternative explanation, namely that Chk2 does not participate significantly in the p53 responses of human cells. One exciting implication of this interpretation is that another, as yet unknown, kinase functions to communicate the DNA damage signal to p53 in human cells. Chk1 would appear to be an obvious candidate for such a kinase, because it can phosphorylate serine 20 of p53 in vitro (10Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Ahn et al. (44Ahn J. Urist M. Prives C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20480-20489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) have found that down-regulation of either or both Chk1 or Chk2 by RNA interference does not prevent human breast and colorectal cells from inducing p53 in response to DNA damage. Thus, the identity of the authentic, physiologically relevant kinase upstream of p53 in human cells remains an important open question. Finally, our results readily explain why some tumors arise with alterations of both Chk2 and p53, as our data show that mutations of these genes do not lead to similar defects. And our data raise an intriguing question: if an essential function of Chk2 does not involve p53 or the checkpoints studied here, what is the role of this highly conserved gene in human cells, and why is it mutated in cancers and cancer-prone individuals? The lines we have generated should be instrumental for answering such questions in the future.

Binding of substrates requires the zinc finger-like region and the COOH-terminal region of DnaJ (12Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Only full-length DnaJ, comprising both the J-domain and the substrate-binding domain, is effective, together with DnaK and GrpE, in refolding denatured firefly luciferase (12Szabo A. Korszun R.

Based on these findings, it has been proposed that substrates first associate with DnaJ, which then transfers them to the substrate-binding site of Hsp70 (6Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C.

The function of DnaJ has also been assumed to include a “catalytic activation” of DnaK for trapping target sequences (4Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol.

A recent study has shown that DnaJ shares most binding motifs with DnaK, which also seems to qualify DnaJ as a targeting partner for the chaperone DnaK (16Rüdiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, no direct experimental evidence has been reported for substrate transfer from DnaJ to DnaK, and the concept of a targeting action of DnaJ has as yet remained obscure (16Rüdiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The catalytic activation of DnaK by DnaJ (4Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol.

Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Recent work (6Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Mogk A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5452-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) has shown that the stimulatory effect of DnaJ on the ATPase activity of DnaK was much stronger in the presence of a protein substrate than in the presence of a peptide substrate; however, the mechanism underlying this difference has not been clarified. Here we present a study on the interactions of substrate with both DnaK and DnaJ. Our results show that in the case of a protein substrate, the chaperone action of DnaJ (binding to substrate) and its co-chaperone action (stimulating the ATPase activity of DnaK) co-operate in ternary (ATP·DnaK)m·substrate·DnaJn complexes, in which DnaJ, through a proximity effect, efficiently triggers the hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP and thus the conversion of DnaK from its low affinity T state to its high affinity R state that locks onto the substrate. Proteins and Peptides—Nucleotide-free DnaK was purified as described (18Feifel B. Sandmeier E. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined photometrically with a molar absorption coefficient of ϵ280 = 14,500 m–1 cm–1 (19Hellebust H. Uhlen M. Enfors S.O. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5030-5034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DnaJ and GrpE, prepared as reported (20Schönfeld H.-J. Schmidt D. Zulauf M. Prog. Colloid Polym. Sci. 1995; 99: 7-10Crossref Google Scholar, 21Schönfeld H.-J. Schmidt D. Schröder H. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2183-2189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), were a gift from Dr. H.-J. Schönfeld (Hoffmann-LaRoche Basel). The concentrations of stock solutions of purified DnaK and GrpE were determined by amino acid analysis. Reduced carboxymethylated albumin (RCMLA) (bovine) was from Sigma. Peptides ala-p5 (ALLLSAPRR), pA (segment of protein DnaA, 229VDALLIDDIQFFA241), and d-p5′ (CALLLSAARR) were purchased with a purity >95% from Mimotopes and labeled with the environmentally sensitive fluorophor acrylodan (Molecular Probes) at the α-amino group (peptides ala-p5 and pA) or at the sulfhydryl group (peptide d-p5′) and purified as described (22Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). For denaturing rhodanese (from Sigma), 5 mg of protein was dissolved in 1 ml of denaturing buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 0.5 m Tris chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.6) and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. Iodoacetamide (50 mm) was added to block the sulfhydryl groups, and after 1 min at 25 °C the denatured protein was transferred to assay buffer (25 mm Hepes/KOH, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) with a NAP-5 column (Amersham Biosciences). For digesting denatured rhodanese, a sample of the protein was incubated with immobilized TPCK-treated trypsin (Pierce) overnight at 37 °C according to the product instructions. Recombinant DnaJ1–106 was expressed and purified as described (2Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and its molecular mass was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The concentrations of RCMLA, denatured rhodanese, and DnaJ1–106 were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Determination of Kinetic Constants—The binding rate constants of DnaJ for acrylodan-labeled peptides were determined as described (23Feifel B. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11999-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For the fast kinetic measurements, an SX18 MV stopped flow machine from Applied Photophysics served to record the changes in intrinsic fluorescence of DnaK (excitation at 290 nm; band pass, 15 nm; emission high pass filter, 320 nm) and in fluorescence of acrylodan-labeled peptides (excitation at 370 nm; band pass, 12 nm; emission high pass filter, 455 nm). All of the experiments were performed in assay buffer at 25 °C and were started by mixing equal volumes (70 μl each) of the two reaction solutions. All of the traces were obtained by averaging at least nine measurements. The concentrations indicated are final concentrations, if not indicated otherwise. The reaction traces were fitted with single-exponential functions and evaluated with the software provided by the manufacturer of the instrument, if not indicated otherwise. ATPase Assays—ATPase activity of DnaK was measured under single-turnover conditions as described (5Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6643-6649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). [2,5′,8-3H]Adenosine 5′-triphosphate ammonium salt (41 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The radioactive ADP product was separated from radioactive ATP by thin layer chromatography, and the radioactivity of ADP and ATP was determined with a liquid scintillation counter. All of the experiments were performed in assay buffer at 25 °C. The data were analyzed with Sigmaplot 5.0 (from SPSS). Size Exclusion HPLC—Protein mixtures (the molar ratio of DnaK, DnaJ, and denatured rhodanese were 1:1:1) were preincubated in 100 μl (final volume) assay buffer containing 1 mm ATP for 10 min at 25 °C. After incubation, the samples were injected into a TSK G3000SW HPLC column (0.75 cm × 60 cm, Sigma), which was calibrated with gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad) and was equilibrated in assay buffer containing 10% (v/v) acetonitrile, and eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Protein was detected at 214 nm. The peak fractions were pooled, concentrated with Ultrafree-MC filter membrane (10,000 nominal molecular weight limit; Millipore), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Peptide Binding to and Release from DnaK and DnaJ—To establish the experimental approach for exploring the targeting action of DnaJ, the peptides to be used in this study were first tested for binding to and release from DnaK and DnaJ. Peptides, when bound to the substrate-binding domain of DnaK, stimulate the hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP. This increase in single-turnover ATPase activity was used as an indicator of binding of substrate to DnaK. In agreement with previous reports (16Rüdiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 23Feifel B. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11999-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the acidic peptide pA and the d-peptide d-p5′ did not bind to DnaK, as shown by their inability to stimulate its ATPase activity, whereas peptide ala-p5 bound to DnaK and stimulated the ATPase activity of DnaK 20-fold at saturating concentrations (Table I). The increase in fluorescence of the acrylodan-labeled peptides a-ala-p5, a-d-p5′, and a-pA served for determining their rates of binding to DnaJ (Table II). DnaJ binds all three peptides, although it disfavors acidic peptides (16Rüdiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and d-peptides (23Feifel B. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab The addition of GrpE plus ATP to a preformed ADPPi· DnaK·peptide complex triggers the fast release of peptide because of the GrpE-accelerated ADP/ATP exchange in DnaK, i.e. the conversion of DnaK from the high affinity R state to the low affinity T state. The dissociation rate constant of a-ala-p5 from DnaK (kobs = 0.6 ± 0.04 s–1) was determined by following the decrease in acrylodan fluorescence upon addition of GrpE and ATP with a stopped flow apparatus (Fig. 1). No signal change was observed after mixing GrpE plus ATP with DnaJ plus a-ala-p5, a-pA, or a-d-p5′, indicating that GrpE does not affect the substrate binding properties of DnaJ. Substrate Binding to DnaK Strictly Depends on Intrinsic Affinity—DnaJ binds l- and d-peptides (16Rüdiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 23Feifel B. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11999-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and exhibits a chaperone effect by binding unfolded proteins and preventing their aggregation (8Langer T. Lu C. Echlos H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Previous reports have suggested that DnaJ may play a primary role in the selection of substrate for DnaK by catalytically activating DnaK to bind substrates that DnaK cannot bind on its own (4Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 15Wawrzynow A. Banecki B. Wall D. Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19307-19311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A recent report with DnaK mutants, however, indicated that the intrinsic affinity of substrate to DnaK is crucial for the chaperone activity of Hsp70s (17Mayer M.P. Schröder H. Rüdiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We used the GrpE-induced R → T conversion, which, as shown above, triggers the fast release of substrate from DnaK without affecting substrate binding to DnaJ, as a means to investigate this controversial issue. If DnaJ activated DnaK in the presence of ATP to trap a DnaJ-bound peptide that DnaK cannot bind on its own, the transferred peptide should be released from DnaK upon the addition of GrpE. The peptides a-ala-p5 (binder of both DnaK and DnaJ) and a-pA and a-d-p5′ (both exclusive binders of DnaJ) were used as substrates. A decrease in fluorescence was elicited only in the case of the DnaK binder a-ala-p5, whereas no signal change was observed in the case of the exclusive DnaJ binders a-pA and a-d-p5′ cases (Fig. 2). The unchanged fluorescence of peptide a-pA and a-d-p5′ upon the addition of GrpE indicated that DnaK, even in the presence of DnaJ and ATP, can bind neither pA nor d-p5′. The absence of a change in the fluorescence signal cannot be ascribed to rebinding of these peptides to DnaJ after their release from DnaK, because the association rate constants of DnaJ for both a-pA and a-d-p5′ were slower than that for peptide aala-p5 (Table II). If the experiment was performed in the presence of excess unlabelled peptide, peptides a-pA and a-d-p5′ were released at the same rate as in the absence of DnaK, indicating again that the release of peptide a-pA or a-d-p5′was from DnaJ but not from DnaK (data not shown). DnaJ cannot target either the substrate to DnaK or DnaK to the substrate, i.e. DnaK selects its substrates solely on the basis of its intrinsic affinity. DnaJ and DnaK Compete for Substrate—The co-operation between DnaJ and DnaK has been proposed to include the transfer of substrate from DnaJ to DnaK in the presence of ATP (16Rüdiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has not as yet been experimentally verified. Here we tested an alternative, assuming that the distribution of a given substrate between the two chaperones might be determined simply by their relative intrinsic affinities (5Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6643-6649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), i.e. that DnaK and DnaJ compete for the substrate. We used peptide a-ala-p5 as substrate, because ala-p5 binds to both DnaK and DnaJ (Tables I and II, respectively). As shown above (Figs. 1 and 2), GrpE in the presence of ATP may be used to differentiate between DnaK-bound and DnaJ-bound substrate. If DnaJ competed with DnaK for the substrate in the presence of ATP, more peptide would bind to DnaJ with increasing concentration of DnaJ, and less would bind to DnaK. The amplitude of the decrease in fluorescence intensity upon the addition of GrpE would be reduced. We found that with increasing concentration of DnaJ, the amplitude of the release reaction indeed decreased, with the rate of the peptide release remaining unchanged; at 10 μm DnaJ the amplitude was only one-tenth of that of the control without DnaJ (Fig. 3). Rebinding of peptide to DnaJ may again be excluded to interfere with the release from DnaK. At the tested conditions, the values of the dissociation rate constant of peptide a-ala-p5 (koff = 4.0 ± 0.6 s–1; trace not shown) and the association rate of peptide with DnaJ (kon = 0.004 μm–1 s–1; Table II) render the extent of peptide rebinding to DnaJ negligible. Similar evidence for competition between DnaK and DnaJ for substrate was obtained when GrpE plus ATP were added to a preincubated solution of DnaK, DnaJ, and a-ala-p5 in assay buffer containing ADPPi, 2W. Han and P. Christen, unpublished data. a result also consistent with a previous report on binding experiments in the absence of ATP (16Rüdiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We conclude that DnaJ, in both the presence and the absence of ATP, competes with DnaK for a peptide with a single binding motif rather than targets the peptide to DnaK. In the Presence of a Peptide Substrate, the Co-chaperone Action of DnaJ Is Independent of Its Chaperone Action—The chaperone and co-chaperone actions of DnaJ, i.e. interaction of DnaJ with substrate and with DnaK, respectively, reside in different domains of DnaJ (2Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 4Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 7Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol.

We therefore probed the question whether binding of a peptide to DnaJ modulates its interaction with DnaK. The peptides pA and d-p5′ served as substrates that bind to DnaJ but do not bind to DnaK (Tables I and II and Refs. 16Rüdiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar and 22Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In the presence of these exclusive DnaJ binders, the DnaJ-stimulated ATPase activity of DnaK remained the same as that in the absence of peptide substrate, whereas in the presence of the DnaK binder ala-p5, the DnaJ-stimulated ATPase activity of DnaK was enhanced 5-fold (Table III). In accord with this result, the rate of the increase in intrinsic fluorescence caused by hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP upon the addition of DnaJ was the same in the presence of 20 μm pA or d-p5′ as that in the absence of peptide, whereas in the presence of the DnaK binder ala-p5, the rate of the fluorescence change is two times faster (Table III). Apparently, binding of substrate to DnaK is a prerequisite for the increase in DnaJ-stimulated ATPase activity. Occupancy of the substrate-binding cleft by substrate does indeed induce its closure (24Han W. Christen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The finding that DnaJ, when liganded with peptide pA or d-p5′, stimulates the ATPase activity of DnaK to the same level as DnaJ alone indicates that the binding of peptide substrate to the substrate-binding domain of DnaJ does not affect the interaction of its J-domain with DnaK, i.e. that, in the presence of a peptide, the co-chaperone action of DnaJ is independent of its chaperone action.Table IIIBinding of a peptide to DnaJ does not affect the interaction between DnaJ and DnaKPeptide ligandDnaJ-stimulated ATPase activity (kcat)aMeasured by single-turnover ATPase assay as described (5).

Surprisingly, pufflectin shares sequence homology with mannose-binding lectins of monocotyledonous plants and has conserved two of three carbohydrate recognition domains of these plant lectins. The pufflectin gene is expressed in gills, oral cavity wall, esophagus, and skin. In addition, an isoform occurs exclusively in the intestine. Pufflectin differs from mannose-binding lectins purified from the blood plasma of Fugu. Whereas pufflectin did not agglutinate five bacterial species tested, it was demonstrated to bind to the parasitic trematode, Heterobothrium okamotoi. This finding suggests that pufflectin contributes to the parasite-defense system in Fugu. We have characterized pufflectin, a novel mannose-specific lectin, from the skin mucus of the pufferfish, Fugu rubripes. Molecular mass estimations by gel filtration and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and the SDS-PAGE pattern suggest that pufflectin is a homodimer composed of non-covalently associated subunits of 13 kDa.

Fish Dis. 1992; 2: 249-279Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar), just as the inner surface of the mammalian gut. In mammals, the peculiar mucosal immune system serves as an extra-epithelial first line of defense against pathogens that originate from the contents of the intestine (2Kiyono H. Ogra P.L. McGhee J.R. Mucosal Vaccines. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar, 3Ogra P.L. Mestecky J. Lamn M.E. Strober W. Bienenstock J. McGhee J.R. Mucosal Immunology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1999Google Scholar). Because water is a perfect medium for bacteria and parasitic microbes, the fish integument is constantly exposed to pathogen attack. It is generally believed that the barrages against pathogen invasion exist in the surface of the fish body and that cutaneous mucus serves as a mechanical as well as a biochemical barrier (1Alexander J.B. Ingram G.A. Ann. Rev. Fish Dis. 1992; 2: 249-279Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar). However, the biochemical details are poorly understood. Various humoral defense factors such as immunoglobulin, complement, C-reactive protein, lysozyme, and hemolysin have been detected in the skin mucus of fish (1Alexander J.B. Ingram G.A. Ann. Rev. Fish Dis. 1992; 2: 249-279Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 4Ingram G.A. J. Fish Biol. 1980; 16: 23-60Crossref Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Lectins, carbohydrate-binding proteins that are neither antibodies nor enzymes (5Sharon N. Lis H. Science. 1972; 177: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 6Barondes S.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 480-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), are also present in the mucus (1Alexander J.B. Ingram G.A. Ann. Rev.

Fish species with lectins in the integumental mucus include the windowpane flounder Lophopsetta maculata (7Kamiya H. Shimizu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 622: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the ling Genypterus blacodes (8Oda Y. Ichida S. Mimura T. Maeda K. Tsujikawa K. Aonuma S. J.

(Tokyo). 1996; 62: 138-141Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the Japanese eel Anguilla japonica (16Tasumi S. Ohira T. Kawazoe I. Suetake H. Suzuki Y. Aida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27305-27311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Lectins are probably present in the skin mucus of many additional species, because the mucus of many fishes induces hemagglutination, a property typical of lectins (17Suzuki Y. Takashima F. 2nd Ed. An Atlas of Fish Histology. Normal and Pathological Features. Kodansya, Tokyo1995: 8-17Google Scholar). Despite this apparent ubiquity of mucus lectins, experimental data that elucidate their assumed function in pathogen defense are scarce. On the basis of the structure of the carbohydrate recognition domain, animal lectins are divided into four main groups: C-type (20Day A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), galectins (21Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N.W. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kasai K. Hirabayashi J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), P-type (23Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar), and I-type (24Powell L.D. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14243-14246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). So far, sequences of mucosal lectins have been determined in only two species of the Anguilliformes, namely the conger (congerin I and II) and the Japanese eel (AJL-2). Congerin I and II were classified as galectins (18Muramoto K. Kamiya H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1116: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Muramoto K. Kagawa D. Sato T. Ogawa T. Nishida Y. Kamiya H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 123: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); this class probably dominates among the skin mucus lectins because many of them interact specifically with galactose or lactose. On the other hand, AJL-2 has a sequence typical of C-type lectins (16Tasumi S. Ohira T. Kawazoe I. Suetake H. Suzuki Y. Aida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27305-27311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Lectins of ling and kingklip might belong to the same class because of the Ca2+ dependence of their activity and their typical SDS-PAGE pattern (8Oda Y. Ichida S. Mimura T. Maeda K. Tsujikawa K. Aonuma S. J. Pharmacobio-Dyn. 1984; 7: 614-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Toda M. Goto-Nance R. Muramoto K. Kamiya H. Fish. Sci. (Tokyo). 1996; 62: 138-141Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, it is questionable whether all skin mucus lectins belong to the galectins or the C-type. Unfortunately, the sound knowledge of lectin structure that is necessary to establish the biological role and the functional mechanisms of lectins in the fish integumental mucus is mostly lacking to date. The pufferfish, Fugu rubripes, is a model species in which the genome sequencing project has reached an advanced stage (25Aparicio S. Chapman J. Stupka E. Putnam N. Chia J. Dehal P. Christoffels A. Rash S. Hoon S. Smit A. Gelpke M.D.S. Roach J. Oh T. Ho I.Y. Wong M. Detter C. Verhoef F. Predki P. Tay A. Lucas S. Richardson P. Smith S.F. Clark M.S. Edwards Y.J.K. Doggett N. Zharkikh A. Tavtigian S.V. Pruss D. Barnstead M. Evans C. Baden H. Powell J. Glusman G. Rowen L. Hood L. Tan Y.H. Elger G. Hawkins T. Venkatesh B. Rokhsar D. Brenner S. Science. 2002; 297: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). We have studied the mucus of the skin and intestine of this species and found interesting lectins that resemble those of monocotyledonous plants. Here we report the primary structure, tissue-specific expression, and biochemical characteristics of these lectins. In addition, we describe binding of the lectin to Heterobothrium okamotoi, a serious parasite of the Fugu (26Ogawa K. Jpn. J. Parasitol. 1991; 40: 388-396Google Scholar). Preparation of Skin Mucus Extract—Fugu were supplied by Fukui Prefecture Fisheries Experimental Station (Japan). The skin mucus was scraped off with a spatula and was homogenized with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.33 mm MgCl2 (PBS 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcriptase; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MBL, mannose-binding lectins. (+) buffer). The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (crude skin mucus extract) was further analyzed. Hemagglutination Tests—Serial 2-fold dilutions of the samples (25 μl) with PBS(+) buffer were made on microtiter plates with 96 wells. Twenty five μl of a 5% suspension of rabbit red blood cells purchased from commercial dealers were added to each well. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, samples were checked for hemagglutination. The lectin titer was expressed as the greatest sample dilution in which agglutination could be observed. Partial Purification by Ion-exchange Column Chromatography—The crude skin mucus extract was analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC, Amersham Biosciences) on a Poros HQ/M (4.8 × 100 cm, PerSeptive Biosystems) ion-exchange column with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluted proteins were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm, and hemagglutination activity was tested in each 1-ml fraction. Active fractions were combined and concentrated for determination of carbohydrate specificity. Determination of Specific Sugars—Sugar-dependent inhibition of lectin-induced hemagglutination was determined to establish specific sugar-lectin interactions. Twenty five μl of the active fraction identified by FPLC was serially 2-fold diluted with PBS(+) buffer containing 200 mm of either d-glucose, d-galactose, d-mannose, d-fucose, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, N-acetyl-d-galactosamine, maltose, lactose, saccharose, or melibiose in microtiter plates. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, 25 μl of a 5% rabbit erythrocyte suspension was added to each well, and the lectin titer was determined after 1 h as detailed above. Lectin Isolation by Affinity Chromatography—d-Mannose, which specifically interacted with the mucus lectin, was coupled to epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (Amersham Biosystems) as a ligand according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, the epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B matrix was incubated with 3 mm d-mannose in NaOH solution containing 0.5 m NaCl (pH 11.5) at 40 °C for 16 h; then the remaining active sites on the gel were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.0). The crude skin mucus extract was pumped at 10 ml/h through a column (1 × 10 cm) packed with the gel that had been pre-equilibrated with PBS(+) buffer. Afterward, the column was washed with PBS(+) buffer to remove unabsorbed material. Then proteins were eluted from the column with PBS(+) buffer containing 50 mm d-mannose and were collected manually by monitoring the absorbance of the eluate at 280 nm. Electrophoresis—SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (27Leammli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using 15% separating gel in the presence or absence, respectively, of 2-mercaptoethanol. Five μl of affinity-purified fractions were added to the same volume of SDS sample buffer containing 4% SDS with or without 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, respectively. The samples were loaded onto the gels together with a set of markers (Dalton Mark VII-L, Sigma), and gels were run at 20 mA for 1.5 h. After electrophoresis, protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. To determine whether sugar residues were attached to the lectin detected, lectin purified by affinity chromatography was separated by SDS-PAGE and was blotted from the gel onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Atto Instruments) at 100 mA for 1 h. The membrane was stained with periodic acid-Schiff reagent using a periodic acid-Schiff staining kit (Muto Kagaku). Isoelectric focusing was performed using 4% polyacrylamide isoelectric focusing gel containing 8 m urea and 2% ampholine (pH 3.5–9.5, Amersham Biosciences). A set of two-dimensional protein pI markers (Dai-ichi) was loaded onto the gel together with the sample. After focusing at 150 V for 5 h, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Molecular Mass Determination—The molecular mass of intact lectin was determined by gel filtration and carried out by FPLC on a column (1 × 30 cm) of Superose 6 (Amersham Biosciences) with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 150 mm NaCl (pH 8.0). The flow rate was maintained at 0.5 ml/min, and the absorbance at 280 nm of the eluate was monitored. Albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and ribonuclease (13.7 kDa) were used as standards. The mass of the lectin subunit was also determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Voyager DE-STR, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For this test, lectin purified by affinity chromatography was embedded in a sinapinic acid (5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) matrix. Enzymatic Digestion and Amino Acid Sequencing—Initial amino acid sequencing attempts showed that the N terminus of the lectin was blocked. Therefore, internal amino acid sequences were determined following enzymatic digestion. Affinity-purified lectin was dissolved in 50 μl of 0.4 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0) containing 2 m urea and was incubated with lysyl endopeptidase (Wako) at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:20 (w/w) at 37 °C for 16 h. The digest was fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Hitachi) on a TSKgel ODS-120T reversed-phase column (4.6 × 250 mm) (Tosoh) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–80%) in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Amino acid sequences of digested fragments were determined using a model 476A protein sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Molecular Cloning of cDNA—Total RNA was extracted from the skin of three individuals using RNA extraction solution (Isogen, Nippon gene). First strand cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA with the SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) for 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Based on the amino acid sequences of the fragments LP-5 and LP-13 (described under “Results”), two degenerate primers were designed: LP-13F, 5′-GA(A/G)AT(A/C/T)GCI(C/T)TITTTCA-3′, and LP-5R, 5′-CATICC(A/G)TG(A/G)TCIC(G/T)(A/G)TCI(C/G)(A/T)GTTC-3′. The first strand cDNA was amplified by PCR (i-Cycler, Bio-Rad) in 20 μl of a reaction mixture containing 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Takara), 2.5 μl of 10× Universal Primer Mix (Clontech), and 500 nm of LP-13F primer for 3′-RACE or LP-5R primer for 5′-RACE, respectively. Amplification was performed in 40 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 2 min; the final elongation reaction was conducted at 72 °C for 10 min. To confirm independently the sequence of the 5′-untranslated region, which had been found to lack a signal peptide, first strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of skin total RNA of another individual using the GeneRacer™ kit (Invitrogen) for 5′-RACE. Reverse transcription was performed at 60 °C for 90 min with ThermoScript (Invitrogen) to remove any RNA secondary structure. GeneRacer™ 5′ primer and the specific primer FML-5′-RACE, 5′-CTCTTGAGCTCAGAGCCTTTCTC-3′, which was synthesized on the basis of the determined sequence, were used for PCR amplification. The nucleotide sequence obtained by 3′- and 5′-RACE over the coding region was confirmed by PCR amplification with the two specific primers FML-SP2 (5′-ATCTTCCTCCTTCTGCTTGCAGTCTA-3′) and FML-AP4 (5′-GTGATGAGAGTTTGGCTTTC-3′). Denaturation was performed at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The resulting PCR product was also used as a probe for Northern blot analysis, and the above-mentioned primers were employed for the RT-PCR analysis described below. Each PCR product generated was ligated into the pCR®2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The plasmid DNA was purified and sequenced with the 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were analyzed using the SeqEd™ version 1.0.3 software (Applied Biosystems). Analyses were repeated with at least five independent PCR amplifications to avoid PCR errors. Homologs of the deduced amino acid sequence were searched with the BLAST 2.0. program accessed via GenomNet (blast.genome.ad.jp/). Multiple alignment of sequences was conducted using the ClustalW Multiple Sequence Alignment Program version 1.8 (clustalw.genome.ad.jp/). Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from muscle, liver, heart, kidney, head kidney, spleen, brain, gonad, gill, oral cavity wall, esophagus, intestine, and skin was isolated from three individuals as described above. Each total RNA sample was reverse-transcribed with the SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kit. PCR amplification was performed in a total volume of 20 μl with Taq DNA polymerase and specific primers, FML-SP2 and FML-AP4 (500 nm each), for 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. Alternatively, the following oligonucleotide primers were synthesized based on the sequence of the intestine-type isoform: FIL-SP1, 5′-CCATGTCCGTCACAGTCTTGGAGAAT-3′; and FIL-AP2, 5′-ATCGGAGTTCCAGAGCTGCTGGCA-3′. These were used to detect the expression of the intestine-type isoform. The protocol of PCR amplification was the same as described above. The PCR products were analyzed by 2.0% agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide. Northern Blot Analysis—Ten μg of the same total RNA from 13 tissues as used in RT-PCR analysis were separated on a 1.5% formamide-agarose denaturing gel in 1× MOPS running buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 8 mm acetate, and 1 mm EDTA) and then blotted onto a Biodyne® nylon membrane (PALL) using 20× SSC (3 m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) as transfer buffer. The membrane was UV cross-linked with a Tl-2000 Ultraviolet Translinker (Ultraviolet Products). A partial cDNA of the lectin amplified by PCR as described above was labeled with alkaline phosphatase using the AlkPhos Direct Labeling kit (Amersham Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions and was used as a probe. Hybridization was conducted using the same kit at 55 °C for 16 h. After hybridization, the membrane was washed and then treated with CDP-Star chemiluminescent detection reagent (Amersham Biosystems). Signals were detected on a LAS-1000 plus image analyzer (Fuji Film) after exposure for 1 h. Sizes of RNA bands were estimated by comparison to a standard 0.16–1.77-kb RNA ladder (Invitrogen). Characterization of Hemagglutination Activity of the Lectin—To examine divalent cation requirements of the purified lectin, serial 2-fold dilutions of the lectin having hemagglutination titer values of 26 (25 μl) was made with PBS(-) buffer containing either 50 mm EDTA or 50 mm CaCl2. After 1 h incubation with 25 μl of 5% rabbit erythrocyte suspension, the lectin titer was measured as detailed above. The inhibitory effects of saccharides on the hemagglutination activity of the lectin were assayed as follows. Twenty five μl of the saccharide solutions tested in this study were diluted 2-fold in series on microtiter plates with PBS(+) buffer and incubated with the same volume of lectin solution diluted to a titer of 26 for 1 h at room temperature. Then 50 μl of a 5% rabbit erythrocyte suspension were added to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature, and the concentration of each saccharide leading to complete inhibition was determined. Agglutination Test with Bacteria—Five strains of fish pathogenic bacteria (provided from the National Research Institute of Aquaculture, Fisheries Research Agency, Japan) were tested for agglutination with affinity-purified lectin. The Gram-negative bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila FPC 866, Edwardsiella tarda FPC 499, and Pseudomonas plecoglossicida FPC 337 were cultured in tryptic soy broth (TSB), and Vibrio anguillarum FPC 675 was grown in TSB containing 2% NaCl. The Gram-positive Streptococcus difficile FPC 576 was cultured in brain heart infusion with 0.5% glucose. The number of cells was estimated by measuring colony-forming units/ml. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 1 min, resuspended in 0.5% (v/v) formalin, and shaken at 25 °C for 24 h. Formalin-killed cells were collected and suspended at ∼108 colony-forming units/ml in PBS(+) buffer. Aliquots of these cells were mixed with equal volumes of affinity-purified lectin at a concentration equivalent to a titer of 1:25 as determined in hemagglutination tests with rabbit erythrocytes. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, agglutination was observed under a light microscope BX60 (Olympus). Binding Test with Parasite—Fluorescence-labeled lectin was prepared using the Alexa Fluor® 488 protein labeling kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's directions. By using tweezers, the adult H. okamotoi (about 1 cm long), which is a monogenean trematode that parasitizes Fugu (26Ogawa K. Jpn. J. Parasitol. 1991; 40: 388-396Google Scholar), was excised from the gill chamber of infected fish. Parasites were fixed with 0.5% formalin in PBS(+) buffer for 5 min and washed with pure PBS(+) buffer. Fixed parasites were immersed in a blocking solution (PBS(+) buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at room temperature for 1 h to block nonspecific binding sites. Subsequently, they were incubated with a 1:4 dilution of Alexa-labeled lectin in blocking solution at room temperature for 1 h. As a control, fixed parasites were incubated with 1:4 dilution of Alexa-labeled lectin in blocking solution containing 1 m d-mannose. Finally, parasites were washed carefully with PBS(+) buffer to remove excess lectin and were placed on glass slides for observation under a fluorescence microscope BX60 (Olympus). Detection of Sugar Specificity—First, we used crude skin mucus extract in hemagglutination inhibition experiments to test for specific lectin-sugar interaction. However, none of the sugars tested inhibited lectin hemagglutination activity. Therefore, we produced partially purified lectin by ion-exchange chromatography. Hemagglutination activity against rabbit erythrocytes was detected in the fraction eluted by 0.25–0.265 M NaCl in Tris-HCl buffer (Fig. 1); it was inhibited exclusively by d-mannose (Table I).Table ISaccharide inhibition of hemagglutination activity of partially purified lectin from Fugu skin mucus extractSaccharidesAgglutination titer (log 2)d-Glucose4d-Galactose4d-Mannose1d-Fucose4N-Acetyl-d-glucosamine4N-Acetyl-d-galactosamine4Maltose4Lactose4Saccharose4Melibiose4PBS(+) buffer only (control)4 Open table in a new tab Purification of Skin Mucus Lectin—A single protein peak was obtained from the crude skin mucus extract of Fugu by d-mannose affinity chromatography when the medium was changed to PBS(+) buffer containing 50 mM d-mannose (Fig. 2). The peak fraction showed hemagglutination activity (data not shown). In both unreduced and reduced SDS-PAGE, the affinity-purified fraction yielded a protein band of ∼14 kDa, which was one of the major soluble proteins in the skin mucus (Fig. 3). This protein, termed pufflectin, was negative to periodic acid-Schiff staining (data not shown), suggesting that it is not glycosylated. The isoelectric point of the lectin was 6.42 (data not shown). The molecular mass of pufflectin was determined to be ∼26 kDa by gel filtration, whereas MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry suggested a mass of about 13.05 kDa (Fig. 4), respectively. Together with the results from SDS-PAGE, these findings suggest that native pufflectin is a dimer of identical 13–14-kDa subunits, which are non-covalently linked. Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—Affinity-purified pufflectin was subjected to Edman degradation, but no sequence could be determined, indicating that the N terminus was blocked. Therefore, we analyzed internal fragments obtained by enzymatic cleavage. Four fragments separated by reversed-phase HPLC (LP-2, -5, -10, and -13; Fig. 5) were scrutinized, and two internal amino acid sequences could be established (LP-5: NH2-Asp-Gly-His-Gln-Leu-Trp-Asn-Ser-Asp-Arg-Asp-His-Gly-Met-COOH; LP-13: NH2-Trp-Ile-Ala-Leu-Phe-Gln-COOH). Molecular Cloning—The partial cDNAs encoding pufflectin including the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions were isolated by 5′- and 3′-RACE methods, respectively. The overlapping sequence was confirmed by PCR amplification with two specific primers, FML-SP2 and FML-AP4. The resulting pufflectin cDNA sequence consisted of 527 bp, including 59 bp of 5′-untranslated region, 348 bp of open reading frame, a stop codon (TGA), and 120 bp of 3′-untranslated region containing a polyadenylation signal (Fig. 6). The open reading frame encoded 116 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 13,133 Da, which was in good agreement with the conclusions drawn from the biochemical analyses discussed above. There were no ATG translation start sites upstream of the open reading frame, indicating that this lectin did not possess a signal peptide. This feature is the common characteristic of the galectins, a super-family of animal lectins that bind to β-galactosides (21Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N.W. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kilpatrick D.C. Handbook of Animal Lectins. John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chichester, UK2000Google Scholar). Homology Analysis—A data base search indicated that the amino acid sequence of pufflectin was not similar to other animal lectins but to mannose-binding lectins of monocotyledonous plants such as common snowdrop, Galanthus nivalis (29Damme E.J.M.V.

The highest degree of homology was found in the common snowdrop lectin, G. nivalis agglutinin (29.4% identity). RT-PCR Analysis—To establish the organ specificity of pufflectin expression, total RNA from different tissues was reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The PCR amplification of the cDNA provided bands of the predicted size (432 bp) in gill, oral cavity wall, esophagus, and skin but not in muscle, liver, heart, kidney, head kidney, spleen, brain, gonads, and intestine (Fig. 8A). There were no differences in the expression patterns between the three individuals tested. The PCR products amplified from positive tissue samples were subcloned and sequenced and were confirmed to be the pufflectin cDNA partial sequences. Northern Blot Analysis—Pufflectin mRNA was present in gill, oral cavity wall, esophagus, intestine, and skin but not in muscle, liver, heart, kidney, head kidney, spleen, brain, and gonads as detected by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 9).

Both trimers inhibit human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) envelope (Env)-mediated cell fusion at nanomolar concentrations by targeting the exposed C-terminal region of the gp41 ectodomain in the prehairpin intermediate state. The IC50 values for N35CCG-N13 and N34CCG are ∼15 and ∼95 nM, respectively, in a quantitative vaccinia virus-based reporter gene assay for HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion using Env from the T cell tropic strain LAV. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against N35CCG-N13 and a tightly binding fraction of anti-N35CCG-N13 inhibits T cell and macrophage tropic HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion with respective IC50 values of ∼0.5 and ∼1.5 μg/ml at 37 °C. The tightly binding anti-N35CCG-N13 antibody fraction targets the exposed internal trimeric coiled-coil in the prehairpin intermediate state of gp41 in a manner analogous to peptides derived from the C region of the gp41 ectodomain. The potency of the tightly binding anti-N35CCG-N13 antibody fraction in the fusion assay is comparable with that of the broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody 2G12.

Both proteins therefore present highly attractive targets for the development of antiviral agents as well as broadly neutralizing antibodies. HIV Env-mediated cell fusion involves a complex series of events. gp120 first binds to CD4 and a chemokine receptor; this triggers conformational changes in the gp120-gp41 complex that lead to the insertion of the gp41 fusion peptide into the target membrane and ultimately to cell fusion (2Moore J.P.

Prior to the formation of the fusogenic trimer of hairpins, e-gp41 exists in a “prehairpin” intermediate state (2Moore J.P. Trkola A. Dragic T. Curr. Opin.

There are three classes of fusion inhibitors that target the prehairpin intermediate state of e-gp41 (right-hand side of Fig. 1). Class 1 inhibitors (shown in blue at the top right of Fig. 1) are directed against the internal trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices. Examples of class 1 inhibitors include peptides derived from the C-helices such as C34 (residues 628–661 of HIV-1 Env) 2The nomenclature is as follows: N13, N34, N35, N36, C28, and C34 are peptides encompassing residues 546–558, 546–579, 546–580, 546–581, 628–655, and 628–661 of HIV-1 Env, respectively; N34CCG and N35CCG correspond to N34 and N35, respectively, with Leu576, Gln577, and Ala578 of HIV-1 Env substituted by Cys, Cys, and Gly, respectively; N35CCG-N13 is a 48-residue peptide comprising N35CCG immediately followed by N13; NCCG-gp41 is a chimeric protein comprising N35CCG fused onto the minimal thermostable ectodomain core of gp41: N35CCG-N34-(L6)-C28, where L6 is a six-residue linker (SGGRGG); 6H, 20-residue non-native sequence derived from the cloning vector containing a His6 tag.2The nomenclature is as follows: N13, N34, N35, N36, C28, and C34 are peptides encompassing residues 546–558, 546–579, 546–580, 546–581, 628–655, and 628–661 of HIV-1 Env, respectively; N34CCG and N35CCG correspond to N34 and N35, respectively, with Leu576, Gln577, and Ala578 of HIV-1 Env substituted by Cys, Cys, and Gly, respectively; N35CCG-N13 is a 48-residue peptide comprising N35CCG immediately followed by N13; NCCG-gp41 is a chimeric protein comprising N35CCG fused onto the minimal thermostable ectodomain core of gp41: N35CCG-N34-(L6)-C28, where L6 is a six-residue linker (SGGRGG); 6H, 20-residue non-native sequence derived from the cloning vector containing a His6 tag. and T20 (also referred to as DP178, residues 638–673 of HIV-1 Env which extends 10 residues beyond the C-terminal end of the C-helix), both of which have IC50 values in the low nanomolar range (16Wild C.T.

The class 2 inhibitors (shown in red at the bottom right of Fig. 1) are directed against the exposed C region of e-gp41. Examples include engineered proteins such as NCCG-gp41 (13Louis J.M. Bewley C.A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29485-29489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and IQN17 (21Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11187-11192Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), both of which expose the internal trimeric coiled-coil of e-gp41 in a stable manner, and the protein 5-helix, which exposes only a single helix of the internal trimeric coiled-coil (14Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). NCCG-gp41, IQN17, and 5-helix have IC50 values in the 15–25 nM range. Finally, the class 3 inhibitors (shown in yellow, middle right of Fig. 1), exemplified by the construct N36Mut(e,g), which comprises a mutated version of the trimeric coiled-coil that can no longer interact with the C region of e-gp41, act by forming heterotrimers of the N-terminal coiled-coil (22Bewley C.A. Louis J.M. Ghirlando R. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14238-14245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The chimeric protein NCCG-gp41 (Fig. 2) comprises an exposed trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices (residues 546–579 of HIV-1 Env with L576C, Q577C, and A578G mutations) that is stabilized by fusion to a minimal thermostable ectodomain of gp41 and by engineered intersubunit disulfide bonds (13Louis J.M. Bewley C.A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29485-29489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We anticipated that antibodies raised against NCCG-gp41 could potentially target the exposed trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices in the prehairpin intermediate state of gp41 in a manner analogous to the class 1 inhibitors (13Louis J.M. Bewley C.A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29485-29489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, antibodies directed against NCCG-gp41 will inevitably comprise a mixture of antibodies that bind not only to the exposed trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices but also to the outer surface of the minimal thermostable ectodomain, which comprises the C-helices. To circumvent this problem, we have therefore engineered two simpler variants of NCCG-gp41 that comprise only the internal trimeric coiled-coil of e-gp41: N34CCG and N35CCG-N13 (Fig. 2). We show that these two variants are also nanomolar inhibitors of HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion. In addition, we demonstrate that purified anti-N35CCG-N13-specific antibodies effectively inhibit HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion. The IC50 of the tight binding anti-N35CCG-N13-specific antibody fraction is comparable with that of the broadly neutralizing, gp120 targeted, monoclonal antibody 2G12 (23Trkola A Pomals A.P. Yuan H.

Armbuster C. Vcelar B. Stoiber H. Kunert R. Michael N.L. Jagodzinski L.L. Ammann C. Jager W. Jacobson J. Veller N. Kattinger H. AIDS. 2002; 16: 2019-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the internal trimeric coiled-coil of e-gp41 is accessible to neutralizing antibodies in the prehairpin intermediate state and that N35CCG-N13 represents a potentially suitable immunogen for the generation of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Peptides—The C34 peptide (residues 628–661 of HIV-1 Env), purchased from Commonwealth Biotechnologies (Richmond, VA), was synthesized on a solid phase support, purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and verified for purity by mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. C34 bears an acetyl group at the N terminus and an amide group at the C terminus. Generation of N34CCGand N35CCG-N13 Constructs—The synthesis and cloning of the chimeric protein NCCG-gp41 (Fig. 2) has been described previously (13Louis J.M. Bewley C.A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29485-29489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). NCCG-gp41 comprises the engineered construct N35CCG-N34-(L6)-C28, where N35CCG spans residues 546–580 of HIV-1 Env with L576C, Q577C, and A578G mutations, N34 spans residues 546–579 of HIV-1 Env, (L6) is a six-residue SGGRGG linker, and C28 spans residues 628–655 of HIV-1 Env. The insert spanning the N35CCG-N34-(L6)-C28 domains was isolated by restriction digestion with NdeI and BamHI enzymes, and cloned into the pET15b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), which introduces an additional 20-residue, non-native segment (GSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHM) at the N terminus containing a His6 tag. The resulting construct 6H-NCCG-gp41 was subsequently used to generate the N34CCG and N35CCG-N13 constructs using the purified primers 5′-CTCACGGTCTGGGGCATCAAACAATGTTGTGGCCGCTAGTCCGGCATTGTGCAACAGCAAAACAACTTACTCGC and 5′-GTGCAACAGCAAAACAACTTACTGCGCGCGTAAGAAGCGCAGCAGCACCTGTTACATTG and their complements, respectively, together with the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The N34CCG and N35CCG-N13 constructs therefore also bear the 20-residue non-native His6 tag at their N terminus. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The composition of all expressed proteins was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Note that NCCG-gp41 was produced either with or without a His6 linker and termed 6H-NCCG-gp41 and NCCG-gp41, respectively. N34CCG and N35CCG-N13 were only produced with the His6 tag linker sequence. Purification and Protein Folding—The cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium to an optical density of 0.7, induced with 2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 4 h, and harvested by centrifugation. The trimeric, intermolecular disulfide-linked form of NCCG-gp41 was prepared exactly as described previously (13Louis J.M. Bewley C.A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29485-29489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To produce the trimeric, intermolecular disulfide-linked forms of the N34CCG and N35CCG-N13, 2 gm of cells were suspended in 40 ml of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (GnHCl), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A) and lysed by sonication, followed by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm (SS-34 rotor; Sorvall, Newtown, CT) for 30 min at 18 °C. The supernatant was subjected to Ni-NTA-agarose affinity column (bed volume, 10 ml) chromatography at room temperature. The column was washed in buffer A, and bound protein was eluted in the same buffer containing 0.2 m imidazole. The protein was concentrated on a Centriprep YM-3 device (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA) and applied at room temperature at a flow rate of 3 ml/min to a Superdex-75 column (HiLoad, 2.6 × 60 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 4 m GnHCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The peak fractions were then subjected to reverse-phase HPLC on POROS 20 R2 resin (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using a linear gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The peak fractions were pooled and stored at -80 °C. ∼3.2 mg of C34 peptide (residues 628–661 of HIV-1 Env) was dissolved in 35% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O containing ∼2.2 mg of either N34CCG or N35CCG-N13 protein at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. The polypeptide mixture (N34CCG + C34 or N35CCG-N13 + C34), kept in a Slide-A-Lyzer cassette (3.5 molecular weight cutoff; Pierce), was folded by dialysis against 2 liters of 50 mm sodium formate buffer, pH 3.0, for 15 h at room temperature. The intermolecular disulfide bonds were then allowed to form by oxidation using the following dialysis scheme: 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.25, for 2 h; 50 mm sodium formate, pH 3.0, for 3 h; 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.25, for 15 h; and finally 50 mm sodium formate, pH 3.0, for 24 h. The N34CCG/C34 and N35CCG-N13/C34 complexes were concentrated to ∼1 ml and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions to verify that N34CCG and N35CCG-N13 were predominantly disulfide-linked trimers. The N34CCG/C34 and N35CCG-N13/C34 complexes were subsequently denatured in 7.5 m GnHCl, applied on a Superdex-75 column (2.6 × 60 cm; Amersham Biosciences) and fractionated under denaturing conditions in 4 m GnHCl, 50 mm sodium formate, pH 4. The peak fractions corresponding to the trimeric, disulfide-linked, N34CCG or N35CCG-N13 proteins, stripped of C34, were pooled, dialyzed (3.5 MWCO; Pierce) against excess 50 mm sodium formate buffer, pH 3.0, concentrated (YM-3, Millipore), and stored at 4 °C. Concentrations of all samples were determined spectrophotometrically; the calculated absorbances at 280 nm (1 cm path length) for a concentration of 1 mg/ml of NCCG-gp41, N34CCG, N35CCG-N15, and C34 are 2.026, 0.987, 0.786, and 2.90, respectively. The corresponding molecular masses as monomers are 11863, 6011, 7546, and 4286 Da, respectively. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra of N34CCG (10 μm) and N35CCG-N15 (8 μm) were recorded in 20 mm sodium formate buffer, pH 3.0, at 25 °C on a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter using a 0.05-cm path length cell. Quantitative evaluation of secondary structure from the CD spectrum was carried out using the program CDNN (www.bioinformatik.biochemtech.uni-halle.de/cd_spect/index.html (26Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar)). Production of Antibodies and Purification of IgG—Antibodies to the intermolecular disulfide-linked 6H-N34CCG and 6H-N35CCG-N13 trimers were raised in rabbits using the accelerated protocol services provided by Covance (Covance Research Products, Denver, PA) (27Vaitukaitis J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 73: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). 125 μg of N34CCG and 200 μg of N35CCG-N13 was used for each initial and subsequent boost injections. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to estimate antibody titers and IgG affinity purifications on immobilized protein A columns were performed according to established procedures (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). An average value of 1.7 absorbance units at 280 nm for 1 mg/ml was used to calculate the concentration of purified antibodies. Western Blotting—Proteins, nonreduced and reduced (in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol), were subjected to SDS-PAGE on premade 10–20% linear gradient Tris-Tricine gels (Invitrogen). The gels were soaked for 10 min and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) in 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, 190 mm glycine, and 20% methanol using a mini-electrophoretic transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). The blots were then processed using a WesternBreeze kit, a chromogenic immunogenic system for the detection of rabbit primary antibodies (Invitrogen). Purification of Anti-N35CCG-N13-specific Antibodies—N35CCG-N13 was bound to Ni-NTA-agarose via its N terminus His6 tag as follows. 1.2–1.3 mg of N35CCG-N13 in 15 ml of PBS, pH 6.5, was slowly dispensed into a beaker containing Ni-NTA-agarose (7.5 ml of packed volume) suspended and kept stirred in 15 ml of PBS, pH 6.5, at room temperature. The agarose was packed in a XK-26 column (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated in PBS, pH 6.5. 10 ml of protein A affinity chromatography-purified IgG (1.8 mg/ml) derived from rabbit antisera to N35CCG-N13 was passed through the column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The unbound fraction was collected, and after washing the column extensively in PBS, the bound antibodies were eluted in 50 mm glycine, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 3.0. The peak fractions were immediately combined, and the pH was adjusted to 8.5 using 1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0. The protein fraction that precipitates in the latter step was recovered by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min. The purification of antibodies from the pellet (precipitate) and supernatant (soluble) fractions was identical and conducted as follows. The pellet was solubilized and denatured in 10 ml of 6 m GnHCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The supernatant was likewise denatured in 6 m GnHCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The GnHCl-denatured material was passed through a fresh Ni-NTA-agarose column (packed volume, 7.5 ml) equilibrated in the same buffer. Refolding of IgG in the flow-through (∼15 ml) was achieved by initial dialysis against 100-fold excess of 2 m GnHCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer for about 5 h at room temperature, followed by extensive dialysis against PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. The resulting two fractions of anti-N35CCG-N13-specific IgG, one derived from the pellet, the other from the supernatant, were concentrated (YM-10; Pierce) and stored at -20 °C. As a control, protein A affinity-purified IgG from preimmune serum was also carried through the denaturation/refolding procedure. Cell Fusion Assay—Inhibition of HIV Env-mediated cell fusion by N34CCG, N35CCG-N13, NCCG-gp41, and the various antibodies was carried out as described previously (13Louis J.M. Bewley C.A. Clore G.M.

Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3614) Google Scholar) (C. Broder, P. Kennedy, and E. Berger); and recombinant CD4 (Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY). B-SC-1 cells were used for both target and effector cell populations. For experiments employing T-cell tropic Env, target cells were coinfected with recombinant vaccinia viruses vCB21R-LacZ (encoding β-galactosidase) and vCBYF1-fusin (encoding CXCR4) and effector cells with vCB41 (encoding Env from HIV-1 LAV) and vP11T7gene1 (encoding T7 polymerase) at a multiplicity of infection of 3.0. In the experiments employing macrophage (M) tropic Env, the target cells were co-infected with vCB-CCR5 (encoding the M tropic co-receptor CCR5) and vCB21R-LacZ and target cells with vCB21 (encoding Env from HIV-1 SF162) and vP11T7gene1. Following infection, the cells were incubated for 18 h at 32 °C to allow for vaccinia virus-mediated expression of recombinant proteins. For inhibition studies, proteins or antibodies were added to an appropriate volume of 2.5% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and PBS to yield identical buffer compositions (100 μl), followed by the addition of 1 × 105 effector cells (in 50 μl of medium)/well and 1 × 105 target cells (in 50 μl of medium)/well. Soluble CD4 was added to the medium of the target cells at a concentration of 800 nm to yield a final concentration of 200 nm soluble CD4/well. (This is double the concentration required to saturate the β-galactosidase signal; see Ref. 29Salzwedel K. Smith E. Dey B. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Following 2.5 h of incubation at 37 °C, the β-galactosidase activity of cell lysates was measured from the absorbance at 570 nm (Molecular Devices 96-well spectrophotometer) upon the addition of chorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (Roche Applied Science). The curves for the percentage of fusion versus peptide inhibitor concentration were fit by nonlinear least squares optimization using the program Kaleidagraph 3.5 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). In terms of cytotoxicity, neither the trimeric proteins N34CCG, N35CCG-gp41, and NCCG-gp41 nor the antibodies directed against N35CCG-N13 showed any deleterious effects toward cell viability over the time period (2.5 h) of the fusion assay. We also note that previous experiments with our original NCCG-gp41 construct (13Louis J.M. Bewley C.A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29485-29489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) using an HIV-1 spreading assay in MT4 cells over a 25-day period indicated no evidence of cytotoxicity at a concentration of NCCG-gp41 (400 nm) at which HIV-1 spreading (as measured by reverse transcriptase activity) was completely inhibited. 3R. Willey and M. A. Martin, personal communication. Rationale for the Design of N34CCGand N35CCG-N13—We have previously shown that the chimeric protein NCCG-gp41 (Fig. 2), which comprises an exposed, stable disulfide-linked, trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices grafted in helical phase onto the minimal thermostable core of e-gp41, inhibits HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion with an IC50 value of 15–20 nM. The NCCG-gp41 construct is as follows: N35CCG-N34-L6-C28 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The exposed, disulfide-linked, internal trimeric coiled-coil of e-gp41 is formed by N35CCG, and the minimal thermostable core of e-gp41 is formed by N34-L6-C28. From the perspective of a potential therapeutic, the NCCG-gp41 trimer suffers from being rather"

Surprisingly, although Chk2 purified from DNA damage sustaining cells has dramatically increased ability to phosphorylate Cdc25C when compared with untreated cells, its ability to phosphorylate p53 is weak before treatment, and there is no increase in its activity toward p53 after DNA damage by γ irradiation or the radiomimetic agent neocarzinostatin. Furthermore, introduction of Chk2 short interfering RNA into three different human tumor cell lines leads to marked reduction of Chk2 protein, but p53 is still stabilized and active after DNA damage. The results with Chk1 short interfering RNA indicate as well that Chk1 does not play a role in human p53 stabilization after DNA damage. Thus, Chk1 and Chk2 are unlikely to be regulators of p53 in at least some human tumor cells. We discuss our results in the context of previous findings demonstrating a requirement for Chk2 in p53 stabilization and activity.

We discuss our results in the context of previous findings demonstrating a requirement for Chk2 in p53 stabilization and activity. The p53 tumor suppressor protein has been well studied as a target of numerous stress-induced signaling pathways in mammalian cells. Various forms of DNA damage bring about stabilization and activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein presumably through prevention of the interaction of p53 with its negative regulator Mdm2. 1The abbreviations used are: Mdm2, murine double minute 2; ATM, Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein; Chk1, Checkpoint Kinase 1; Chk2, Checkpoint Kinase 2; NCS, neocarzinostatin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, short interfering RNA; HA, hemagglutinin; Gy, gray; DTT, dithiothreitol; WT, wild type; DNA-PK, DNA-activated protein kinase. Induction of p53, a sequence-specific transcriptional activator, results in expression of a number of gene products whose function is to either arrest cell growth or promote apoptosis. As such, p53 has been defined as a checkpoint factor (reviewed in Refs. 1Morgan S.E. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shen Y. White E. Adv.

ATM is a protein kinase with homology to members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family, and of the various DNA damage pathways to p53, that involving ATM has been the best documented; ATM-null cells fail to induce p53 after some forms of DNA damage (4Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar), and the ability of ATM kinase to phosphorylate p53 is stimulated by specific types of DNA damage such as those caused by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic agents (5Siliciano J.D.

Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). The ATM pathway itself is functionally related to DNA damage checkpoints in both budding and fission yeast. In fission yeast, as yet unidentified DNA damage sensor proteins may signal directly or indirectly via downstream kinases or adaptor proteins to the homologous mediator kinases Rad3 and Tel1, which in turn regulate through phosphorylation two effector kinases Cds1 and Chk1 (8Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). A key target for these kinases is the Cdc25 dual specificity phosphatase that in unstressed cycling cells removes repressing phosphates from the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2 and thereby allows it to promote passage through G2/M (reviewed in Ref. 9Nurse P. Cell. 1997; 91: 865-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). When the human homologues of Chk1 or Cds1 were identified and cloned, it became clear that they could phosphorylate different members of the human Cdc25 family (10Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S.

Phosphorylation of human Cdc25C at Ser216 leads to its inactivation by 14-3-3-mediated translocation to the cytoplasm (15Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4465-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). There are a number of lines of evidence showing that in human cells ATM is upstream of Chk2. Perhaps the most compelling of these are observations that ATM phosphorylates Chk2 at Thr68in vitro and that ionizing radiation leads to Chk2 phosphorylation at Thr68 and its subsequent activation in wild type but not ATM null cells (17Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 18Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The relationship between the ATM pathway and Chk1 is less well understood. It is currently believed that Chk1 kinase is downstream of ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase), another member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family (20Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 21Guo Z.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Although it is possible to generate cells and animals lacking ATM and Chk2, deletion of ATR or Chk1 causes early embryonic lethal events (20Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K.

More recently, homozygous deletion of Chk1 in the B cell lymphoma line, DT40, revealed that this kinase is essential for G2/M arrest and that its loss decreases survival after γ irradiation (25Zachos G. Rainey M. Gillespie D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Upon various forms of cellular stress, p53 becomes phosphorylated at a number of sites within its N and C termini (reviewed in Ref. 26Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p53 at N-terminal sites such as Ser15, Thr18, Ser20, and Ser37 within the vicinity of the region where it interacts with Mdm2 can disrupt its interaction with Mdm2 in vitro (27Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 28Dornan D. Hupp T.R.

Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar, 33Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar). Among the possible sites, Thr18 and Ser20 lie within the region of p53 that interacts directly with Mdm2 (34Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser20 in human p53 was shown to render p53 less well stabilized after DNA damage and more sensitive to down-regulation by Mdm2 (35Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). By contrast, murine fibroblasts harboring a mutation of the equivalent residue to human Ser20 that changes murine Ser23 to Ala23 are apparently normal in their response to DNA damage (38Wu Z. Earle J. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Given that both Chk1 and Chk2 are checkpoint effector kinases, it was not unexpected that several groups have linked them experimentally with p53. Using a biochemical fractionation approach to identify Ser20 kinase activity, we previously discovered that the human homologues of Chk1 and Chk2 could phosphorylate p53 at this site as well as a number of other sites within the N terminus such as Ser15, Thr18, and Ser37 along with unidentified sites within other regions of the protein (39Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of either Chk1 kinase-defective or Chk1 antisense constructs leads to diminution of levels of co-transfected p53 protein (39Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a parallel study Chehab et al. (30Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that Chk2 can phosphorylate Ser20 and that a kinase defective form of Chk2 prevents stabilization and phosphorylation at Ser20 of co-transfected p53 after DNA damage. Overexpression of Chk2 in U2OS cells, which carry wild type p53, augmented G1 arrest following irradiation. Further supporting a role for Chk2 as being upstream of p53, Hirao et al. (40Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) reported that thymocytes and fibroblasts generated from Chk2 knock-out mice are defective in accumulating p53 after γ but not UV irradiation. Intriguingly, a second group using mouse embryo-fibroblasts derived from these mice found that even at low doses of γ irradiation, G1 arrest and p21 induction were intact (41Jack M.T. Woo R.A. Hirao A. Cheung A. Mak T.W. Lee P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9825-9829Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). More recently, the results from a second independently generated Chk2 null mouse have indicated that Chk2 loss protects mice from γ irradiation-induced death consistent with diminished apoptosis in several tissues including the spleen, intestine, and central nervous system and that p53 in these cells is transcriptionally inactive (42Takai H. Naka K. Okada Y. Watanabe M. Harada N. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Nakanishi M. Suzuki H. Nagashima K. Sawa H. Ikeda K. Motoyama N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Finally, data from human patients have revealed that a subset of Li-Fraumeni cancer-prone families with wild type p53 has Chk2 germ line mutations (43Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C. Shannon K.E. Lubratovich M. Verselis S.J. Isselbacher K.J. Fraumeni J.F. Birch J.M. Li F.P. Garber J.E. Haber D.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2971-2974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 46Matsuoka S. Nakagawa T. Masuda A. Haruki N. Elledge S.J. Takahashi T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5362-5365PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, this natural experiment is not completely recapitulated in murine models. Hirao et al. (47Hirao A. Cheung A. Duncan G. Girard P.M. Elia A.J. Wakeham A. Okada H. Sarkissian T. Wong J.A. Sakai T. De Stanchina E. Bristow R.G. Suda T. Lowe S.W. Jeggo P.A. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6521-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) observed no increase in spontaneous tumors in Chk2–/– mice, whereas Takai et al. (42Takai H. Naka K. Okada Y. Watanabe M. Harada N. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Nakanishi M. Suzuki H. Nagashima K. Sawa H. Ikeda K. Motoyama N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) reported preliminary evidence of an increase in lymphoma development by 71 weeks in Chk2–/– animals. Given that there is somewhat contradictory evidence surrounding the proposed Chk2-p53 connection, we set out to further characterize Chk2 derived from human tumor cells that have an intact DNA damage response. The goal was to study Chk2 before and after activation by either γ irradiation or the radiomimetic compound neocarzinostatin (NCS). To our surprise, the results from both biochemical and short interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments argue against a role for Chk2 in DNA damage-mediated stabilization of p53 in cancer cells following γ radiation or similar stimuli. We discuss the basis for the differences between our present results and those that have been previously published, including our own. Mammalian Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—An HCT116-deryived cell line stably expressing N-terminally HA-tagged wild type hChk2 (HA-Chk2) was kindly provided by Dr. J. Chen (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) (45Wu X. Webster S.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2971-2974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 400 μg/ml of G416 and 10% fetal bovine serum. For RNAi experiments, HCT116 and RKO (p53 wild type human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells) and MCF-7 (p53 wild type human breast adenocarcinoma cells) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. HT-29 (p53 mutant human colorectal cancer cells) were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Purification of Proteins—Where indicated, the cells were treated with a radiomimetic compound NCS (500 ng/ml) (Kayaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 2 h before purification of HA-Chk2 as described below. Alternately, the cells were irradiated with 14 Gy (using a 137Cs source) and harvested after 2 h for purification of HA-Chk2. Typically, cells in 20 × 140-mm plates were collected and treated with lysis buffer A containing 50 mm Hepes KOH, pH 7.8, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm DTT, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 60 nm okadaic acid, 240 pm cypermethrin, 1 mm NaF, 100 μm NaVO4, and 20% glycerol. The extracts were precleared with 400 μl of protein A conjugated to agarose (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h at 4 °C and incubated with 100 μl of protein A cross-linked with anti-HA antibody for 12 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected in a disposable column and extensively washed with lysis buffer a containing 20 mm Hepes KOH, pH 7.8 (15 × 1 ml). The proteins were eluted with 100 μg/ml of HA peptide (SynPep, Dublin, CA) and then dialyzed against buffer B containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 20% glycerol. C-terminally FLAG-tagged wild type and mutant (D347A) Chk2 (Chk2-FLAG) mutant proteins were immunopurified from recombinant baculovirus infected sf-9 insect cells. Typically, 20 × 140-mm plates were collected and treated with the buffer. The extracts collected after centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min were incubated with 0.25 ml of anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to agarose (Sigma). The beads were collected in a 5-ml syringe and washed with lysis buffer A. The proteins were eluted with 100 μg of FLAG peptide (Sigma) and dialyzed against buffer B. Wild type and kinase-defective mutant (D130A) GST-Chk1 proteins were purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells as follows. The cells were incubated with lysis buffer A, and the extracts were collected with 0.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4BL beads (Amersham Biosciences). GST-Chk1 proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione after washing away any unbound protein with lysis buffer A and then dialyzed as described above with buffer B. The plasmid encoding GST-Cdc25C (200–256) was kindly provided by Dr. Junjie Chen. GST fusion proteins, GST-Cdc25C (200–256), GST-p53 (1–82), GST-p53 (97–363), and GST-p53 (WT) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells after induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 2.5 h (final concentration, 1 mm)at20 °C. The proteins were purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4BL beads in lysis buffer A followed by elution with 10 mm of glutathione and dialyzed as described above. His-p53 (WT) was purified as described by Zhou et al. (48Zhou J. Ahn J. Wilson S.H. Prives C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 914-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assays and Western Blotting—Typically 5–20 ng of kinase was incubated with 0.1–4 μg of GST fusion protein substrates. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in 20 μl of Buffer C containing 20 mm Hepes KOH, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 60 nm okadaic acids, 240 pm Cypermethrin, 1 mm NaF, 100 μm NaVO4, and 100 μm ATP supplemented with 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were terminated by adding 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subsequently identified and quantitated by immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies. The radiolabeled proteins were visualized with autoradiography and quantitated with PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The antibodies were obtained as follows: anti-GST and anti-FLAG (M2) were from Sigma; anti-HA was from Covance (Princeton, NJ); and anti-His was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoprecipitation Kinase Assays—HCT 116 parental cells in 4 × 140-mm plates were collected and treated with lysis buffer A as described above. The extracts were incubated with 50 μl of agarose beads conjugated with protein A (Amersham Biosciences) and 2 μg of anti-Chk2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with buffer A (15 × 0.5 ml). The indicated amount of beads were incubated with GST-fused substrates in kinase buffer C, and the data were analyzed as described above. Phosphorylation of p53 by DNA-PK—GST-p53 (1–82) (10 μg) was incubated with DNA-PK (100 ng) in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm ATP, and 10 μg/ml of DNA fragments generated from HpaII-digested pBlue-script. Purified DNA-PK was a generous gift of D. Chan (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkley, CA). The mixtures were incubated for 4 h at 30 °C. Phosphorylation at Ser15 was confirmed by separating the reaction mixture on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferring to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotting with anti-Ser(P)15-specific antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). The prephosphorylated GST-p53 was purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4CL beads as described above. RNA Interference—siRNA duplexes were synthesized by Xeragon Oligoribonucleotides (Huntsville, AL). The luciferase control sequence has been described previously (49Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). The sequences of the Chk1 oligonucleotides were: 5′-GAAGCAGUCGCAGUGAAGATT-3′ and 5′-UCUUCACUGCGACUGCUUCTT-3′. The sequences of the Chk2 oligonucleotides were: 5′-GAACCUGAGGACCAAGAAC-3′ and 5′-GUUCUUGGUCCUCAGGUUC-3′. The cells were transfected twice 24 h apart with 1.68 μg of the indicated siRNA duplex using Lipo-fectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells that were untreated or treated with 500 ng/ml NCS for the indicated time periods were lysed in TEGN buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture) 72 h after the first transfection. Chk1 was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Chk2 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (ProSci Inc., Poway, CA). p53 was detected using a mixture of monoclonal antibodies DO-1 and 1801. Protein loading was estimated using an anti-actin polyclonal antibody (Sigma). -Cdc25CS216 and p53S20 antibodies (Cell Signaling) phospho-specific antibodies were used. p53 transcriptional targets were detected using anti-p21 (Ab-1) and anti-HDM2 (Ab-1) (Oncogene Research, San Diego, CA) and anti-p53-induced gene 3 (kindly provided by D. Hill, Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) antibodies. Chk2 Is Not Activated to Phosphorylate p53 after DNA Damage—Chk2 isolated from cells that have sustained DNA strand breaks is greatly stimulated to phosphorylate Cdc25C at Ser216 when compared with Chk2 isolated from untreated cells (17Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 18Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We were therefore interested in determining whether DNA damage to human cells would similarly activate Chk2 to phosphorylate p53. To characterize Chk2 protein kinase activity, we used clonally derived cells from the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 that were engineered to stably express HA-tagged Chk2 (45Wu X. Webster S.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2971-2974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These cells express similar levels of stably expressed exogenous HA-Chk2 and endogenous Chk2 (Ref. 45Wu X. Webster S.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2971-2974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar and Fig. 1A). HCT116 cells harbor wild type p53 that becomes stabilized after DNA damage (50Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar). HA-Chk2 protein could be specifically immunopurified from HCT116 cells using anti-HA antibody cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads (Fig. 1B). We compared immunopurified HA-Chk2 from HCT116 cells that had been either not treated or treated with the radiomimetic agent NCS. As expected, the DNA-damaging treatment led to hyper-phosphorylation of HA-Chk2 as evidenced by a mobility shift on SDS-PAGE, and HA-Chk2 from NCS treated cells was far more effective in phosphorylating a fragment of Cdc25C that contains Ser216, than HA-Chk2 from untreated cells (Fig. 1C). By contrast, a fragment of p53 that spans several of its Chk2 phosphorylation sites within the N terminus was phosphorylated less well by HA-Chk2 than Cdc25C, and, remarkably, there was virtually no increase in the ability of HA-Chk2 to phosphorylate p53 after NCS treatment (Fig. 1C).Fig. 1ADNA damage activates Chk2 to phosphorylate a fragment of Cdc25C but not the N terminus of p53.A, total cell extracts (100 μg) of HCT116 (HA-Chk2) (first lane) or HCT116 parental (second lane) cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted with anti-Chk2 antibody. B, HA-Chk2 was immunopurified from extracts of HCT116-HAChk2 cells (20 × 140-mm plates) using anti-HA antibody cross-linked to protein A-beads (second lane) or mock purified by protein A-beads (first lane). The proteins were eluted from the beads by incubating with HA peptide and then dialyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots of dialysates (25% of total) were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. C, HA-Chk2 (10, 20, and 40 ng) purified from HCT116 cells without (lanes 1–3) or with (lanes 4–6) NCS treatment were incubated with 500 ng each of GST-p53 (1–82) and GST-Cdc25C (200–256). The reaction mixtures were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by auto-radiography (lanes 1–6, left panel) or by immunoblotting with either anti-GST or anti-HA antibodies (lanes 7–12, right panel). D, HA-Chk2 (5 ng) purified from HCT116 cells that were treated (lanes 3–6) or not (lanes 7–9) with γ irradiation (13 Gy) were incubated either with 500 ng of either GST-Cdc25C (200–256) (lanes 3, 5, and 8) or GST-p53 (1–82) (lanes 3, 4, and 7) and analyzed as in C. HA-Chk2 was mock-purified from HCT116 parental cells (as in B) with (lanes 10–12) or without (lanes 13–15) γ irradiation. The proteins were incubated with either GST-Cdc25C (lanes 11 and 14) or GST-p53 (lanes 10 and 13). GST-p53 (lane 1) or GST-Cdc25C (lane 2) were incubated with kinase buffer as controls. E, Chk2-FLAG (4, 8, 16, 32, or 100 ng) purified from recombinant baculovirus infected insect cells was incubated with 500 ng of GST-Cdc25C (200–256) (lanes 1–5) or 500 ng of GST-p53 (1–82) (lanes 6–10) in kinase buffer and analyzed as described in A. The proteins used were detected by immunoblotting with anti-GST and anti-FLAG antibodies (lanes 11–20). F, endogenous Chk2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Chk2 antibody from HCT116 parental cells that were untreated (lane 1) or NCS-treated (500 ng/ml) for 2 h (lanes 2–4). Kinase activity of untreated Chk2 (2 μl of beads from untreated cells) was compared with that of NCS-activated Chk2 (2, 4, 6 μl beads) for phosphorylation of 500 ng of GST-p53 (1–82) and GST-Cdc25C (200–256). The amount of protein used in each assay was determined by immunoblotting as shown in the right panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A commonly used inducer of DNA strand breaks is γ irradiation, and so we performed a similar experiment comparing HA-Chk2 from γ irradiated or unirradiated HCT116 cells (Fig. 1D). The limitation in this case was that it was not possible to rapidly irradiate large quantities of these cells with ease, and thus smaller amounts of Chk2 were used. Nevertheless the results were essentially the same as with NCS. HA-Chk2 activity toward Cdc25C was significantly increased after γ irradiation, whereas that toward p53 was not detectably affected by irradiation. In this experiment we tested Cdc25C and p53 alone as well as together to demonstrate that the lack of increased phosphorylation of p53 after DNA damage is not due to competition with Cdc25C within the same reaction mixture for available kinase, a conclusion further supported by experiments shown below. Control purification from extracts of parental HCT116 cells revealed no contaminating kinases that were activated after γ irradiation to phospho"

Here, we have examined the action of MVIIA on mutant and wild type calcium channels transiently expressed in tsA-201 cells. Although we have shown previously that mutations in a putative external EF-hand motif in the domain IIIS5–H5 region alters block by both ω-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA (Feng, Z. P., Hamid, J., Doering, C., Bosey, G. M., Snutch, T. P., and Zamponi, G. W. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 15728–15735), the introduction of five point mutations known to affect GVIA blocking (and located downstream of the EF-hand) affected MVIIA block to a smaller degree compared with GVIA. These data suggest that despite some overlap, MVIIA and GVIA block does not share identical channel structural determinants. At higher concentrations (∼3 μm), MVIIA reversibly blocked L-, P/Q-, and R-type, but not T-type channels, indicating that the overall architecture of the MVIIA site is conserved in all types of high voltage-activated calcium channels. A kinetic analysis of the MVIIA effects on the N-type channel showed that MVIIA blocked resting, open, and inactivated channels. Although the development of MVIIA block did not appear to be voltage-, nor frequency-dependent, the degree of recovery from block strongly depended on the potential applied during washout. Interestingly, the degree of washout was highly variable and appeared to weakly depend on the holding potential applied during toxin application. We propose a model in which N-type calcium channels can form both reversible and irreversible complexes with MVIIA.

Interestingly, the degree of washout was highly variable and appeared to weakly depend on the holding potential applied during toxin application. We propose a model in which N-type calcium channels can form both reversible and irreversible complexes with MVIIA. A number of predatory species such as spiders, scorpions, and fish hunting mollusks have developed venoms to rapidly stun and kill their prey. Their venoms typically contain a mixture of potent peptide toxins that have evolved to specifically bind to voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels (1Olivera B.M. Miljanich G.P. Ramachandran J. Adams M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 823-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Among calcium channel blocking peptides, ω-conotoxin GVIA (isolated from Conus geographus) and ω-conotoxin MVIIA (isolated from Conus magus) are perhaps the most widely known. Both of these toxins are thought to specifically block the pore of N-type calcium channels from a variety of species. Block by both toxins is considered to be virtually irreversible at normal membrane potentials (i.e. Refs. 2Woppmann A. Ramachandran J. Miljanich G.P. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1994; 5: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and 3Fox J.A. Pflugers Arch. 1995; 429: 873-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but complete reversibility can be obtained upon strong hyperpolarization (4Stocker J.W. Nadasdi L. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3002-3013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or by removal of extracellular divalent carrier ions (5Liang H. Elmslie K.S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8884-8890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our current understanding of the molecular basis of N-type channel block came initially from a study by Ellinor et al. (6Ellinor P.T. Zhang J.F. Horne W.A. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) who showed that block of transiently expressed N-type channels by ω-conotoxin GVIA was dramatically attenuated by sequence substitution in the domain III S5–S6 region of the Cav2.2 α1 subunit. More recently, Feng et al. (7Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Doering C. Bosey G.M. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15728-15735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) showed that additional point mutations in an EF-hand consensus motif in this region affected the development of, and recovery from, block by both GVIA and MVIIA, consistent with binding studies showing that both toxins compete for the same site on the α1 subunit of the channel (1Olivera B.M. Miljanich G.P. Ramachandran J. Adams M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 823-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 8McDonough S.I. Mintz I.M. Bean B.P. Soc. Neurosci. 1995; 21: 1409Google Scholar). MVIIA has received particular notoriety because a synthetic version of this toxin blocks pain transmission when injected intrathecally (9Scott D.A. Wright C.E. Angus J.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 451: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Indeed, under the names “ziconotide” and “SNX-111,” MVIIA is currently in phase III clinical trials, however, in some cases, severe side effects have been reported (10Penn R.D. Paice J.A. Pain. 2000; 85: 291-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 11Jain K.K. Expert. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2000; 9: 2403-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12Levin T. Petrides G. Weiner J. Saravay S. Multz A.S. Bailine S. Psychosomatics. 2002; 43: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although complete knockout of Cav2.2 in mice does not result in serious adverse effects (13Saegusa H. Kurihara T. Zong S. Kazuno A. Matsuda Y. Nonaka T. Han W. Toriyama H. Tanabe T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2349-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 14Saegusa H. Matsuda Y. Tanabe T. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 43: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it is possible that the acute shutdown of N-type channel activity by toxin administration may well result in a different physiological response compared with gene knockout. It therefore remains unclear as to whether MVIIA side effects are related to the N-type channel blocking action of this toxin. As a consequence, it is important to elucidate in detail the intricacies of MVIIA action on N-type, and other types of voltage-gated calcium channels. Here, we have examined some of the molecular and kinetic details of MVIIA action on calcium channels transiently expressed in tsA-201 cells. Our data show that manipulations of the domain III S5–S6 region in the rat Cav2.2 calcium channels differentially affect GVIA and MVIIA block. Whereas MVIIA completely inhibited Cav2.2 channel action at concentrations as low as 100 nm, other types of high voltage-activated calcium channels including Cav1.2, Cav2.1, and Cav2.3 were reversibly blocked in the micromolar range, indicating that an ω-conotoxin docking site may be generally conserved in many members of the calcium channel family. Cav2.2 channels were blocked in the resting, open, and inactivated conformations, but block was neither frequency, nor voltage-dependent. As reported by Stocker et al. (4Stocker J.W. Nadasdi L. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3002-3013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), MVIIA block of Cav2.2 channels could be reversed during strong membrane hyperpolarization, however, in our hands, reversibility remained incomplete. The degree of recovery varied greatly from cell to cell, and appeared to weakly correlate with more depolarized holding potentials during toxin application, but not with the duration for which the toxin was applied. We therefore propose that the MVIIA-calcium channel complex can exist in two conformations that differ in their stabilities. Molecular Biology and cDNA Constructs—The wild type rat calcium channel CMV-α1B (Cav2.2), pMT2α1A (Cav2.1), pMT2α1E (Cav2.3), pMT2α1C (Cav1.2), pMT2β1b, pMT2β2a, and pMT2α2-δ1 subunit cDNAs were kindly donated by Dr. Terry Snutch. The human pMT2α1G (Cav3.1) cDNA used here has been described by us recently (15Beedle A.M. Hamid J. Zamponi G.W. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 187: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The pEGFP cDNA construct used for cell selection was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Mutagenesis of selected amino acid residues was performed as follows. The entire α1B coding region was first subcloned as a SalI/KpnI fragment into pBluescript (Stratagene). A unique RsrII/SphI restriction fragment of that clone (spanning 3520 to 4849 nucleotides) was subcloned into a modified pUC19 vector. The 146-bp PstI/NcoI region of the pUC subclone, which contained all six residues to be mutated, was generated with amino acid substitutions within the “upstream” primer containing the PstI restriction site. High fidelity PCR amplification (Proofstart, Qiagen) was performed using the wild type clone as template and the specific upstream primer with a primer downstream of the NcoI site. Clone 5M had the following amino acid substitutions: Q1327K, D1330L, E1334N, E1337K, and Q1339R inserted by PCR. Clone 6M1 had an additional substitution, E1332R, in combination with the five aforementioned mutations. Sequences of the four PstI/NcoI fragments were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing before assembling sequentially back into the pUC subclone, then the pBluescript full-length clone, and finally inserts of all full-length mutants were cloned into the vector pCDNA3.1- (Invitrogen). The activation and inactivation behaviors of the mutant N-type channel constructs were indistinguishable from those of the wild type channels. Although we did not examine this here, we note that our previous single channel analysis indicates that a mutation of residue Glu-1332 to arginine alters the relative permeabilities of barium and calcium (16Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Doering C. Jarvis S.E. Bosey G.M. Bourinet E. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5726-5730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), hence, we may expect a similar effect in clone 6M1. Tissue Culture and Transient Transfection—Unless stated otherwise, the calcium channel β1b and α2-δ1 subunits and the pEGFP construct were coexpressed with either wild type or mutant calcium channel α1 subunit cDNAs. For experiments involving α1G, β1b and α2-δ1 were omitted. The exact protocols for tissue culture and transient transfection of calcium channel cDNAs have been reported by us on several occasions (for example, see Ref. 7Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Doering C. Bosey G.M. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15728-15735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In brief, tsA-201 cells were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented by fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin, and split 12 h prior to transfection with 6 μg of each calcium channel cDNA and 1 μg of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) cDNA, using the calcium phosphate method. Twelve hours after transfection, cells were washed with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and after a recovery period of 12 h, the cells were moved to a 28 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for maintenance. Recordings were then carried out between 2 and 5 days subsequently. Electrophysiology—Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) linked to a personal computer equipped with pClamp v9.0. Patch pipettes (Sutter borosilicate glass, BF 150-86-15) were pulled with a Sutter P-87 microelectrode puller, and subsequently fire polished using a Narishige microforge. Pipettes (in the range of 2–4 MΩ) were filled with internal solution containing 108 mm Cs-methanesulfonate, 4 mm MgCl2, 9mm EGTA, 9 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 adjusted with tetraethylammonium-OH).The cells were transferred to a 3-cm culture dish containing recording solution comprised of 5 mm BaCl2, 1mm MgCl2, 10mm HEPES, 40 mm tetraethylammonium-Cl, 10 mm glucose, 97.5 mm CsCl (pH 7.2 adjusted with tetraethylammonium-OH). Currents were elicited by stepping from various holding potentials to various test potentials using Clampex software. ω-Conotoxin GVIA (Sigma) and MVIIA (Sigma) were dissolved first, respectively, in water and 1% acetic acid, and then diluted in the external recording solution. Solutions containing various concentrations of toxin were delivered directly to the cells by means of a gravity-driven microperfusion system that allows complete solution exchange in less than 1 s. Mock perfusions with acetic acid containing carrier solution corresponding to 3 μm MVIIA did not affect current amplitudes of the various Cav channels examined in this study. In one set of experiments (Fig. 3C), it was necessary to apply 30 μm MVIIA. In this case, the pH of the toxin containing recording solution needed to be re-adjusted with tetraethylammonium-OH. Perfusion with toxin-free mock solution did not affect N-type channel activity. Data were filtered at 1 kHz using a 4-pole Bessel filter, and digitized at a sampling frequency of 2 kHz. Series resistance was compensated, but online leak subtraction p/n protocol was not used. Data were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments). The time constant for development of block was fitted monexponentially, and plotted as an inverse of the toxin concentration to obtain blocking and unblocking rate constants. All curve fittings and preparation of initial figures were carried out using Sigmaplot 4.0 (Jandel Scientific). All error bars are standard errors, numbers in parentheses displayed in the figures reflect numbers of experiments. Statistical analysis was carried out using SigmaStat 2.0 (Jandel Scientific). Differences between mean values from each experimental group were tested using a Student's t test for two groups and one-way analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. Distinct Cav2.2 Channel Structural Determinants Underlie GVIA and MVIIA Block—We have recently shown that point mutations in a putative EF-hand region contained in the domain III S5–H5 region of the Cav2.2 α1 subunit (see Fig. 1A) regulate the blocking and unblocking rate constants for both ω-conotoxins MVIIA and GVIA (7Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Doering C. Bosey G.M. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15728-15735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Based on these results, and on binding experiments showing that both toxins compete for the same macrosite on the N-type calcium channels, we concluded that there is significant overlap in the channel structural determinants that govern block by these toxins. Ellinor et al. (6Ellinor P.T. Zhang J.F. Horne W.A. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) reported that a set of five point mutations in the domain III S5–S6 region (see Fig. 1A) dramatically attenuated GVIA blocking of N-type calcium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. To determine whether the MVIIA block was also affected by these mutations, we recreated these amino acid substitutions, and compared their effects on block by GVIA and MVIIA by coexpressing the channels with β1b and α2-δ1 in tsA-201 cells and carrying out whole cell patch clamp recordings. As seen in Fig. 1B, the time course for development of the GVIA block was significantly slowed in the quintuple mutant. Fig. 1C examines the dependence of the inverse of the time constant for development of block on toxin concentration. The data are nicely described by a linear regression line, as expected from a 1:1 interaction between the channel and the toxin. The blocking rate constant determined from the slope of the fit was decreased 21-fold compared with that observed for the wild type channel. Whereas this is qualitatively consistent with the work of Ellinor et al. (6Ellinor P.T. Zhang J.F. Horne W.A. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) in Xenopus oocytes, these authors reported a somewhat larger reduction in the blocking rate constant (44-fold decrease), which could be because of differences in the expression system, or ion composition in the external recording solution. Fig. 1, D and E, shows an analogous experiment for ω-conotoxin MVIIA. Similar to GVIA, blocking by MVIIA was slowed in the mutant N-type channel, however, the degree of slowing was much smaller than that seen with GVIA (3.75-fold decrease in the blocking rate constant between mutant and wild type channel). We next wanted to determine whether the effects of these five mutations were additive to a separate point mutation, E1332R, which was found previously to slow the time constant of development of the block (7Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Doering C. Bosey G.M. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15728-15735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, B–E, the additional substitution of residue 1332 for arginine mediated a substantial further slowing of the time constants for development of block by each toxin, causing an overall 30-fold slowing of the kinetics of the GVIA block, and a 10-fold slowing of MVIIA block. We also added the G1326P mutation (which by itself dramatically speeds the recovery from toxin block (7Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Doering C. Bosey G.M. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15728-15735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)) to the quintuple mutant; however, the mutant channels were expressed too poorly to allow a meaningful characterization (not shown). Overall, our data indicate that although both toxins act at the same macrosite within the N-type channel, MVIIA and GVIA do not share identical channel structural determinants for block. This suggests that some of the individual contact points between the channel and the toxin differ between GVIA and MVIIA. Alternatively, the toxin-specific changes in the rate of development of block may be because of a steric effect on the access pathway, which may differentially affect the abilities of GVIA and MVIIA to reach the blocking site. At the holding potential (i.e. -100 mV) used in the experiments shown in Fig. 1, the mutations did not measurably increase reversibility of MVIIA and GVIA block, indicating that the mutations did not reduce the stability of the toxin-channel complex. This is supported, in principle, by examination of the unblocking rate constant (i.e. y intercept) obtained from the linear regressions shown in Fig. 1, C and E, which, if anything, revealed a slight decrease in the extrapolated unblocking rate constants in the presence of the mutations. It is, however, important to note that for poorly reversible blockers, unblocking rate constants obtained from analysis such as that shown in Fig. 1, C and E, are easily skewed by even small changes in the slope of the regression line and must thus be viewed cautiously. As shown below, a more rigorous analysis of the effects of mutations on toxin unblock is precluded by a large variability in the degree of recovery from the MVIIA block (see Fig. 4). Development of MVIIA Block Is Independent of Stimulus Frequency and Channel State—Many blockers of voltage-gated calcium channels display state and use-dependent block. To determine whether MVIIA action on N-type calcium channels is frequency-dependent, we examined the time course of development of MVIIA inhibition at stimulus frequencies of 0.1 and 0.5 Hz. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, application of 300 nm MVIIA resulted in complete block of N-type channel activity with a time constant of about 15 s, irrespective of pulse frequency. We then examined the rate of development of MVIIA block at three different holding potentials. In each case, 300 nm MVIIA completely blocked N-type channel activity, and the time constant for development of block was virtually identical at all holding potentials tested (Fig. 2C). Hence, the development of MVIIA block of transiently expressed N-type channels neither appears to be use-dependent, nor holding potential-dependent. The latter data are in contrast with those reported for another pore-blocking ω-conotoxin molecule, SNX-331, whose blocking action is strongly holding potential-dependent (4Stocker J.W. Nadasdi L. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3002-3013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suggest that MVIIA block is not correlated with channel availability. Next, we examined whether the development of MVIIA block required channel opening. To address this issue, cells were held at a holding potential of -100 mV, and current amplitude stability and size were assessed with a series of test depolarizations. Subsequently, MVIIA was applied without evoking further depolarizations for 1 min, before application of a single test pulse to assess current size. In each of the five cells examined, the application of 300 nm MVIIA resulted in the complete block (100%) of current activity (see Fig. 3A for a typical example), indicating that MVIIA is capable of blocking the channel in its resting state, and thus explaining the lack of use dependence shown in Fig. 2, A and B. We then wanted to determine whether MVIIA could block inactivated channels. Fig. 3B shows a typical example of a set of eight experiments designed to address this issue. As illustrated in Fig. 3B, the cells were held at -100 mV and currents were elicited by stepping to +10 mV. The holding potential was then switched to 0 mV until currents were completely inactivated, and the cell was repolarized to -100 mV to monitor the time course for recovery from inactivation. Subsequently, the channels were again inactivated by holding the cells at 0 mV, and 300 nm MVIIA was applied. One minute after MVIIA application, the toxin was washed and the cell was repolarized to a holding potential of -100 mV, revealing that currents could no longer be recovered (see Fig. 3B). In the eight cells examined, only 6.6 ± 1.8% of the current amplitude observed prior to toxin application remained at the end of the test paradigm, indicating that MVIIA could effectively interact with inactivated channels. Finally, we wanted to assess whether MVIIA also blocks open channels. To determine this, we coexpressed the Cav2.2 α1 and α2-δ1 with rat β2a to slow voltage-dependent inactivation, allowing us to maintain some channel activity for up to 5 s. Immediately after channel opening, we perfused a high concentration of MVIIA onto the cells and monitored current activity. As shown in Fig. 3C, application of 3 μm MVIIA (n = 4) increased the rate of current decay, consistent with open channel block developing during the test depolarization. To more clearly isolate this effect, we increased the MVIIA concentration by 1 order of magnitude, and repeated the experiment. As seen in Fig. 3C, after a short (∼500 ms) perfusion lag, increasing the MVIIA concentration to 30 μm (n = 5) dramatically accelerated the development of current inhibition, as expected from the increase in the blocking rate and consistent with open channel block. Taken together, our data thus suggest that the MVIIA binding site on the N-type channel molecule is accessible irrespective of the gating state of the channel. Recovery from MVIIA Block Is Highly Variable and Depends on Holding Potential during Wash—Stocker et al. (4Stocker J.W. Nadasdi L. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3002-3013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that block of N-type channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes by a number of ω-conotoxins, including MVIIA, GVIA, and MVIIC, can be completely reversed by membrane hyperpolarizations to -120 mV. To determine whether this could also be observed for channels expressed in tsA-201 cells, we applied 300 nm MVIIA at a holding potential of -80 mV to block all current activity, and then compared the degree of washout at -80 and -120 mV. As shown in Fig. 4A, stepping the washout potential to -120 mV resulted in a significant increase in the recovery of current activity, however, the current fraction that was recovered amounted to only ∼20% of the initial control current (Fig. 4A). These data appear to be in disagreement with the data of Stocker et al. (4Stocker J.W. Nadasdi L. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3002-3013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suggest the possibility that recovery from toxin block could be dependent on the expression system. However, to our surprise, we found that the degree of recovery was highly variable, ranging from no recovery to about 55% recovery for a given experimental condition (Fig. 4B), with one exception where ∼85% recovery was observed. These data suggest that in some cells there is an equal proportion of reversibly and irreversibly blocked channels, whereas in other cells irreversible block was clearly favored. This variability was independent of toxin lot and was observed under a number of different experimental conditions (for example, see Fig. 4B). Despite the large variability, the degree of recovery appeared to increase when cells were held at more depolarized potentials during toxin application, suggesting the possibility that channels that are blocked by MVIIA in their inactivated state are somewhat more susceptible to recovery from block (Fig. 4B). Yet, with one exception, the degree of reversibility never exceeded the 55% mark, indicating that at least half of the channels in a given cell enter an irreversibly blocked conformation, even if all the channels are inactivated during toxin application. We also examined the possibility that the degree of reversibility might depend on the duration for which the toxin was applied. We therefore analyzed the degree of recovery as a function of duration of application at a holding potential of -80 mV. As shown in Fig. 4C, no correlation between duration of application and degree of recovery was evident under these circumstances. This suggests that the relative proportion of reversibly and irreversibly blocked channels is perhaps determined before formation of the toxin-channel complex. Taken together, it appears as if N-type calcium channels can undergo two MVIIA blocked conformations that differ in their stabilities, with the relative proportions of reversibly and irreversibly blocked channels varying from cell to cell, and with holding potential. MVIIA Can Interact with Other Members of the Calcium Channel Family—The observation that the clinical use of MVIIA has been associated with a number of side effects (10Penn R.D. Paice J.A. Pain. 2000; 85: 291-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 11Jain K.K. Expert. Opin. Investig.

Psychosomatics. 2002; 43: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) may indicate that MVIIA interacts with other targets, such as other types of calcium channels. To test this, we examined MVIIA block for several types of transiently expressed voltage-gated calcium channels under identical experimental conditions. As shown in Fig. 5, all high voltage-activated calcium channels examined (i.e. L-type Cav1.2, P/Q-type Cav2.1, and R-type Cav 2.3) underwent a small (10–20%), but statistically significant inhibition in the presence of 3 μm MVIIA, with the L-type channel being perhaps the most sensitive channel isoform. Unlike with the N-type channel, block of any of the other calcium channels examined could be reversed upon washout (not shown). In contrast, Cav3.1 (T-type) calcium channels were not inhibited at this toxin concentration. It is important to note that the toxin affinity for these channels is at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than that seen with the N-type. Hence, while it seems unlikely that our findings might account for the side effects of MVIIA during clinical use, our data nonetheless indicate that the geometries of the outer vestibules of all high voltage-activated calcium channel families are sufficiently similar to allow them to accommodate ω-conotoxin molecules. State Dependence of MVIIA Action—In this paper, we present several novel insights into the state dependence of ω-conotoxin MVIIA action, with regard to both the development of block and its recovery. We presented three key experiments that allow us to determine with which kinetic state of the channel MVIIA is able to interact. To fully appreciate our findings, we need to recall the basic biophysical profile of the N-type channel when bathed in 5 mm external barium. As we have shown previously (17Roullet J.B. Spaetgens R.L.

Each ENaC subunit contains a PY motif (PPXY) that binds to the WW domains of Nedd4, a Hect family ubiquitin ligase containing 3–4 WW domains and usually a C2 domain. It has been proposed that Nedd4-2, but not Nedd4-1, isoforms can bind to and suppress ENaC activity. Here we challenge this notion and show that, instead, the presence of a unique WW domain (WW3*) in either Nedd4-2 or Nedd4-1 determines high affinity interactions and the ability to suppress ENaC. WW3* from either Nedd4-2 or Nedd4-1 binds ENaC-PY motifs equally well (e.g. Kd ∼10 μm for α- or βENaC, 3–6-fold higher affinity than WW4), as determined by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Moreover, dNedd4-1, which naturally contains a WW3* instead of WW2, is able to suppress ENaC function equally well as Nedd4-2. Homology models of the WW3*·βENaC-PY complex revealed that a Pro and Ala conserved in all WW3*, but not other Nedd4-WW domains, help form the binding pocket for PY motif prolines. Extensive contacts are formed between the βENaC-PY motif and the Pro in WW3*, and the small Ala creates a large pocket to accommodate the peptide. Indeed, mutating the conserved Pro and Ala in WW3* reduces binding affinity 2–3-fold. Additionally, we demonstrate that mutations in PY motif residues that form contacts with the WW domain based on our previously solved structure either abolish or severely reduce binding affinity to the WW domain and that the extent of binding correlates with the level of ENaC suppression. Independently, we show that a peptide encompassing the PY motif of sgk1, previously proposed to bind to Nedd4-2 and alter its ability to regulate ENaC, does not bind (or binds poorly) the WW domains of Nedd4-2. Collectively, these results suggest that high affinity of WW domain-PY-motif interactions rather than affiliation with Nedd4-1/Nedd-2 is critical for ENaC suppression by Nedd4 proteins.

The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; x-, Xenopus; m-, mouse; d-, Drosophila; h-, human; WT, wild type; PDB, Protein Data Bank. is an apically located ion channel found in absorptive epithelia of organs involved in fluid and electrolyte homeostasis such as the kidney, lung, distal colon, and ducts of exocrine glands (1Garty H.

In the kidney, ENaC participates in the unidirectional transport of Na+ ions into epithelial cells of the distal nephron in response to hormonal signaling, particularly aldosterone and vasopressin. ENaC is composed of three homologous subunits (α, β, and γ), each comprised of intracellular N and C termini, two transmembrane domains, and a glycosylated extracellular loop (3Canessa C.M.

Nedd4 is a ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) comprised of a C2 domain, 3 or 4 WW domains, and a ubiquitin ligase Hect domain (9Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D.

The interaction between Nedd4 and ENaC takes place between the WW domains of Nedd4 and the PY motifs of ENaC (9Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D.

A polyproline type II (PPII) helix is formed by residues Pro-614′–Asn-617′, which bind the XP grove of the WW domain (28Kanelis V. Rotin D. Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), a pocket found in all WW domains and SH3 domains. (ENaC residues are indicated with a “′” to distinguish from WW domain residues.) Similar interactions are observed for the PY motifs of β-dystroglycan and WBP1 that bind the dystrophin and YAP65 WW domains, respectively (31Huang X. Poy F. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Sudol M. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 32Pires J.R. Taha-Nejad F. Toepert F. Ast T. Hoffmuller U. Schneider-Mergener J. Kuhne R. Macias M.J. Oschkinat H. J.

Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). However, unique to the Nedd4 WW domain-βENaC PY complex, a helical turn is adopted by residues Tyr-618′–Leu-621′ (C-terminal to the PPII helix), which is stabilized by intrapeptide and peptide-domain interactions involving both Tyr-618′ and Leu-621′ (28Kanelis V. Rotin D. Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This suggests that an elongated (extended) PY motif sequence (PPXYXXL), conserved in all ENaC chains, is responsible for binding to Nedd4 WW domains. Thus, our tertiary structure reveals contact points between side chains of Pro-615′, Pro-616′, Tyr-618′, and Leu-621′ of the extended PY motif of βENaC (615PPNYDSL621) and the WW4 domain of rNedd4-1 (28Kanelis V. Rotin D. Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). One focus of our present work is the investigation of the contribution of these contacts to the affinity of binding between ENaC and Nedd4. Moreover, we have probed the importance of the unique contribution of Leu-621′ to binding to the Nedd4 WW domain for the regulation of channel activity. Nedd4 is a suppressor of ENaC that regulates the number of channels at the plasma membrane (33Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin.

Accordingly, Liddle's syndrome mutations, which eliminate all or part of the PY motif of β or γ ENaC and, thus (at least partially), impair binding of the channel to the WW domains of Nedd4, lead to increased cell surface stability of ENaC (8Schild L.

Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in particular Nedd4-1 and Nedd4-2 isoforms have been studied with regard to ENaC binding and regulation (36Kamynina E. Debonneville C.

Recent work has proposed that Nedd4-2 can bind to and regulate ENaC activity much better than Nedd4-1 (33Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J.

However, a puzzling observation demonstrating that human Nedd4-1 (hNedd4-1) is a potent inhibitor of ENaC when lacking its N-terminal region (37Kamynina E. Tauxe C. Staub O. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: 469-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. McDonald F.J. Bucher D.B. J. Biol.

All Nedd4-2 isoforms (including those from Xenopus, mouse, and human, i.e. x/m/hNedd4-2) contain an “extra” WW domain, WW3*, located between WW2 and WW4, which is lacking from rat and mouse Nedd4-1 isoforms but is found in hNedd4-1 and Drosophila Nedd4-1 (dNedd4-1) (see Fig. 1). Both WW3* and WW4 appear to play key roles in regulating ENaC activity (36Kamynina E. Debonneville C. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Staub O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 37Kamynina E. Tauxe C. Staub O. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: 469-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Our results presented here demonstrate that contrary to previous suggestions (that only Nedd4-2 proteins can regulate ENaC), it is the presence of WW3* in either Nedd4-1 or —2 that provides high affinity binding to the ENaC PY motifs, promoting suppression of the channel by the WW3*-containing Nedd4 protein. Peptides—Peptides representing wild-type or mutant sequences of rat ENaC subunits α, β, and γ were synthesized by the Hospital for Sick Children/Advanced Protein Technology Centre (Toronto, Canada). All peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a C18 column with an acetonitrile gradient. Mass and purity of the peptides were confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Wild-type peptide sequences were: α, MTPPLALTAPPPAYATLG (residues 660–677); β, TLPIPGTPPPNYDSL (residues 607–621); and γ, GSTVPGTPPPRYNTLR (residues 617–632), with the indicated substitutions for the β peptides (see Table I). The sgk1 peptide sequence was LYGLPPFYSRNTAE. Lyophilized peptides were re-suspended in 150 mm KCl, 10 mm K+ phosphate, pH 6.5, or where indicated, with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na+ phosphate, pH 6.5.

Bacteria were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Promega) at an A600 of 0.6 for an additional 3 h at 37 °C, and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min. Each poly-His-tagged protein was purified after lysing cells by sonication and applying the soluble supernatant (cleared by 10,000 × g centrifugation) over a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-charged resin column (as described by the manufacturer, Qiagen). The protein was dialyzed overnight into 10 mm K+ phosphate, pH 6.5, plus 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.15 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.15 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm benzamidine at 4 °C before concentrating and purification on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) in 150 mm KCl, 10 mm K+ phosphate, pH 6.5 (or Na+ replacing K+, where indicated).

Fluorescence measurements were obtained using a Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 25 °C with excitation and emission wavelengths of 298 and 333 nm, respectively, and slit widths of 2.5 nm.

ENaC peptides were added at concentrations ranging from 0 to 2 mm. Kd measurements for n experiments, where n is indicated in Tables I and II, were log-transformed such that residuals were normally distributed. Reported Kd means and S.E. were then calculated from the transformed data using the Δ method conversion.

Standard electrophysiological measurements were taken 16–20h after injection. Macroscopic amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents, defined as the difference between Na+ currents obtained in the presence and absence of 5 μm amiloride (Sigma), in the bath were recorded using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique.

These features indicate that Piccolo may act to scaffold proteins involved in synaptic vesicle endo- and exocytosis near their site of action. To test this hypothesis, we have utilized a functional cell-based endocytosis assay and identified the N-terminal proline-rich Q domain in Piccolo as a region that interferes with clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Utilizing the Piccolo Q domain as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified the F-actin-binding protein Abp1 (also called SH3P7 or HIP-55) as a potential binding partner for this domain. The physiological relevance of this interaction is supported by in vitro binding studies, colocalization in nerve terminals, in vivo recruitment studies, and immunoprecipitation experiments. Intriguingly, Abp1 binds to both F-actin and the GTPase dynamin and has been implicated in linking the actin cytoskeleton to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Our results suggest that Piccolo, as a structural protein of the CAZ, may serve to localize Abp1 at active zones where it can actively participate in creating a functional connection between the dynamic actin cytoskeleton and synaptic vesicle recycling.

Presynaptic boutons are highly specialized cellular compartments designed for the rapid, efficient, and regulated release of neurotransmitter. Morphologically, the most prominent feature of these boutons is a region of the presynaptic plasmalemma, called the active zone.

Munc13s have also been found to be important for vesicle priming and are phorbol-ester-binding proteins (20Rhee J.S. Betz A. Pyott S. Reim K. Varoqueaux F. Augustin I. Hesse D. Sudhof T.C.

CAST is a novel 120-kDa CAZ protein that contains a putative C-terminal consensus motif for binding to PDZ (PSD-95/Disc-large/ZO-1 homology) domains that allows it to interact with the PDZ domain of RIM1α (15Ohtsuka T. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue E. Inoue M. Takeuchi M. Matsubara K. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The largest CAZ proteins are a pair of structurally related high molecular weight proteins, Piccolo and Bassoon (3Garner C.C. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). They have molecular masses of 550 and 420 kDa, respectively, and are comprised of numerous modular subdomains that include ten Piccolo/Bassoon homology domains and a pair of double zinc finger domains (8Fenster S.D.

The C2A domain has been suggested to sense changes in Ca2+ in nerve terminals similar to Synaptotagmin (23Gerber S.H. Garcia J. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1605-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Searches for Piccolo and Bassoon binding partners have identified proteins involved in both SV trafficking including the prenylated Rab3A-associated protein (PRA1) (8Fenster S.D. Chung W.J. Zhai R.

Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). These data suggest a role for these proteins in regulating actin dynamics and SV recycling, features fundamental to nerve terminals (4Garner C.C. Zhai R.G. Gundelfinger E.D. Ziv N.E. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 26Goda Y. Neuron. 2002; 35: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Studies on a mouse mutant of Bassoon support this conclusion, as we have found that the absence of wild-type Bassoon disrupts SV recycling at a fraction of excitatory synapses (27Altrock W.D. tom Dieck S. Sokolov M. Meyer A.C. Sigler A. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Richter K. Bockers T.M. Potschka H. Brandt C. Loscher W. Grimberg D. Dresbach T. Hempelmann A. Hassan H. Balschun D. Frey J.U.

Neuron. 2003; 37: 787-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar); however, the molecular details of how it regulates specific steps in this cycle remain unclear. Clearly one aspect of SV recycling in nerve terminals involves a functional cross-talk between the cytoskeleton in general and membrane trafficking machinery, which is thought to be important in ensuring high efficiency and accuracy of vesicle formation and recycling (5Dresbach T. Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 94-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 6Gundelfinger E.D. Kessels M.M. Qualmann B. Nat. Rev.

In nerve terminals, the primary mode of SV endocytosis, subsequent to neurotransmitter release, is compensatory endocytosis. Here a specialized form of clathrin-mediated endocytosis similar to that found in non-neuronal cells has been described (2Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 29Jarousse N. Kelly R.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, many of the proteins associated with clathrin-mediated endocytosis, including Clathrin, AP-2, AP180, Epsin, Esp15, Intersectin, Dynamin, and Amphiphysin (29Jarousse N. Kelly R.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), are enriched in nerve terminals and can be found associated with the CAZ or presynaptic web (30Phillips G.R. Huang J.K. Wang Y. Tanaka H. Shapiro L. Zhang W. Shan W.S. Arndt K. Frank M. Gordon R.E. Gawinowicz M.A. Zhao Y. Colman D.R.

Neuron. 2001; 32: 3-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In addition, nerve terminals contain a number of actin-associated adapter proteins, including HIP1R (32Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Warren R.A. Kessels M.M. Keen J.H. Heuser J. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 154: 1209-1223Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar), Profilin II (33Honore B. Madsen P. Andersen A.H. Leffers H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), Syndapin I (34Qualmann B. Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and Abp1 (35Kessels M.M. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 393-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), that appear to link dynamic aspects of the actin cytoskeleton and the interlinked membrane endocytotic trafficking machinery (36Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 220: 93-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To gain direct clues as to whether Piccolo is involved in SV endocytosis, we have examined whether Piccolo is functionally associated with components of the SV endocytotic machinery. Specifically, we have examined whether specific subdomains in Piccolo can interfere with clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Here, we find that the Q domain in Piccolo has such an activity and has the capacity to interact in vivo with the actin/dynamin-binding protein Abp1. Our results suggest Piccolo may work with Abp1 at or near the active zone to regulate actin rearrangement and membrane dynamics events that are spatially restricted within nerve terminals. Eukaryotic Expression Vectors—The following FLAG-tagged vectors were subcloned as restriction digestion fragments from an original rat cDNA fragment-7f (8Fenster S.D. Chung W.J. Zhai R.

Neuron. 2000; 25: 203-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) into the pCMV-Tag2 vector system (Stratagene) including pFLAG-Piccolo-N-Zn2 ((amino acid (aa) 1–1382), pFLAG-Piccolo-N (aa 1–373)), pFLAG-Piccolo-N-Q (aa 1–526), pFLAG-Piccolo-Q-Zn1 (aa 369–588), and pFLAG-Piccolo-Q (aa 369–494). pEGFP-Q-Zn1 (aa 369–588) and pEGFP-Q (aa 369–494) were constructed using the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech). N-terminally Myc-tagged full-length Abp1 and Abp1-SH3 constructs for overexpression in mammalian cells were described previously (37Kessels M.M. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Qualmann B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Transferrin Uptake Assays—For receptor-mediated endocytosis assays, COS-7 cells were plated onto poly-lysine-coated glass coverslips and grown overnight. Cells were then either subjected to protein import experiments or transfected with different FLAG-tagged Piccolo constructs using the LipofectAMINE PLUS transfection reagent method. For protein imports into COS-7 cells, the BioPorter® (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc.) method was used. The conditions were analogous to a procedure described previously (38Kessels M.M. Qualmann B. EMBO. 2002; 21: 6083-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with complexes containing the His6-Q protein used for the blot overly analyses and BioPorter® or with BioPorter® reagent and PBS for 4 h. Transferrin uptake assays were performed 48 h after transfection and after a 1-hour recovery period following BioPorter® treatment, respectively, as described previously (37Kessels M.M. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Qualmann B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 38Kessels M.M. Qualmann B.

The expression of Piccolo-constructs was visualized with the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) and the anti-thio mouse monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen), respectively. The percentages of cells showing no detectable uptake of transferrin, significantly reduced transferrin signals, and normal levels of internalized transferrin were calculated by scoring the transferrin signals and counting cells in several independent experiments. Expression of tagged Piccolo fragments was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Homogenates of COS-7 cells overexpressing FLAG-Piccolo fusion proteins were prepared from high density cultures in 6-well plates 36 h after transfection. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 30 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors (complete protease inhibitor tablet, EDTA-free; Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and incubated for 20 min on ice. The samples were then spun for 20 min at 14000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatants were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody. The integrity of the His6-Q protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—For the yeast two-hybrid screen, the Q-Zn1 region of Piccolo (aa 369–629) was subcloned into the EcoRI/SalI site of pLexA (Clontech). Yeast two-hybrid assay was performed as described previously (8Fenster S.D. Chung W.J. Zhai R. Cases-Langhoff C. Voss B. Garner A.M. Kaempf U. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. Neuron. 2000; 25: 203-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) using pLexA.Q-Zn1 as bait to screen a mouse brain MATCHMAKER LexA cDNA library (Clontech). To examine the interaction between Abp1 and the Q-Zn1 region of Piccolo, the prey construct pB42AD-Abp1.9.2 and bait constructs containing Pic.Q-Zn1 (aa 369–629), Pic.Q (aa 369–494), and Pic.Zn1 (aa 485–629) were cotransformed into EGY48 (p8oplacZ) yeast cells. Yeast clones cotransformed with bait and prey constructs were selected on plates lacking uracil and tryptophan. Positive clones were selected and assayed for His growth and β-galactosidase activity as described in MATCHMAKER protocols. Fusion Protein Overlay Assays—The vector pGEX2T.1 was modified from pGEX2A (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (8Fenster S.D. Chung W.J. Zhai R. Cases-Langhoff C. Voss B. Garner A.M. Kaempf U. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. Neuron. 2000; 25: 203-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). GST-Abp1.9.2 (aa 194–433 of Abp1) was generated by restriction digestion of the cDNA fragment from pB42AD bait vector as an EcoRI/SalI fragment and ligated into pGEX2T.1. Additional GST-Abp1 fusion protein constructs were generated as described previously (35Kessels M.M. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 393-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). His6-Q was generated by PCR amplification of the Q domain of Piccolo (aa 369–494) and subcloning into pET32a (Novagen) vector. For the overlay assay, 100 pmol of GST fusion protein was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked for nonspecific binding in blocking solution (1× TBS, pH 7.4, 5% skim milk, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min, followed by incubation with 0.1 μm His6-Q in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was further incubated with anti-thio mouse monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) followed by a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. His6-Q bound to GST fusion proteins was visualized by colorimetric alkaline phosphatase reaction with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-phosphate. Antibodies—Piccolo mouse and rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against sap44a and 44a2 sequences fused to GST, respectively, and affinity purified as described previously (7Cases-Langhoff C. Voss B. Garner A.M. Appeltauer U. Takei K. Kindler S. Veh R.W. De Camilli P. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 214-223PubMed Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-Abp1 antibody, anti-Abp1.SF1, was raised in rabbit against a purified His6-tagged fusion protein of Abp1 (aa 194–433) as immunizing antigen. Antibodies were affinity purified on an analogous GST fusion protein of Abp1 bound to Actigel beads (Sterogene) as described (40Zhai R.G. Vardinon-Friedman H. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Ziv N.E. Garner C.C. Neuron. 2001; 29: 131-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Affinity purified guinea pig anti-Abp1 antibodies were described previously (35Kessels M.M. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 393-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-Abp1 antibody, anti-Abp1.MK1, was raised in rabbit against a purified GST fusion protein of Abp1 lacking its SH3 domain. Antibodies were depleted against GST and subsequently affinity purified using the respective maltose-binding protein fusion protein blotted to nitrocellulose membranes, analogous to a method described previously (34Qualmann B. Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-MAP2 antibody (clone HM-2) was from Sigma. Coimmunoprecipitation Assay—pFLAG-Q-Zn1 was constructed by subcloning the Q-Zn1 sequence of Piccolo into the EcoRI/SalI site of pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene). 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with pFLAG-Q-Zn1 using FuGENE reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), harvested, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following sonication and clarification in bovine serum albumin, extracts were incubated with either anti-Abp1.SF1 or anti-FLAG antibodies coupled to Actigel beads at 4 °C for 6 h, followed by immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with FLAG and Abp1 antibodies. In vivo coimmunoprecipitation was performed using soluble rat brain lysates as described previously (9Wang X. Kibschull M. Laue M.M. Lichte B. Petrasch-Parwez E. Kilimann M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat brain membrane pellets were solubilized in homogenization buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, 100 mm Na2CO3 adjusted to pH 11.5) with a mixture of protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h and the supernatant adjusted to pH 7.6. The supernatant was incubated with Piccolo antibody, Abp1 antibody (anti-Abp1.MK1), or rabbit IgG conjugated to Actigel beads for 6 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing of beads in homogenization buffer (pH 7.6 lacking 100 mm Na2CO3), immunoprecipitates were subject to immunoblot analysis with affinity purified anti-Piccolo and anti-Abp1.MK1 antibody. Lamellipodial Recruitment and Cell Perforation Experiments—Resting 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with GFP-Piccolo-Q-Zn1, GFP-Piccolo-Q-Zn1, and Myc-tagged Abp1 or GFP alone were activated by replating the cells onto fibronectin-coated coverslips and additional stimulation with 300 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma) and 5 ng/ml of human recombinant platelet-derived growth factor (Sigma) as described previously (35Kessels M.M. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 393-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed with warm PBS and subsequently either briefly perforated with 0.02% saponin (Sigma) for 5 s or directly fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 for 20 min. The cells were then processed for immunofluorescent microscopy using a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (BabCO) and Alexa Fluor™ 568 goat anti-mouse antibody conjugates (Molecular Probes). The samples were examined using a DMRD fluorescence microscope (Leica) and a confocal microscope. For quantitative analyses, the number of GFP-Piccolo-Q-Zn1-expressing cells per coverslip was quantified live 45 min after replating using an inverted Eclipse TE300 fluorescence microscope (Nikon). Cells were then perforated, fixed, and processed for fluorescence microscopy. Cells with remaining GFP-Piccolo-Q-Zn1 signal were counted again. Several independent experiments were performed and the extent of GFP-Piccolo-Q-Zn1 retention was expressed as percentage of the number of observed GFP-Piccolo-Q-Zn1-positive cells per number of GFP-Piccolo-Q-Zn1-expressing cells. Standard deviations were calculated from independent experiments. Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Primary hippocampal cultures were prepared and grown on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips according to Ref. 41Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G.

COS-7 and 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary hippocampal neurons cultured at low density for 20 days were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. After incubation with 25 mm glycine in PBS for 15 min, cells were permeabilized and blocked for 1 h in 2% bovine serum albumin, 10% horse serum, and 0.02% saponin in PBS. Primary hippocampal neurons kept in culture for 3 days were processed for immunofluorescent microscopy as described previously (43Zhai R. Olias G. Chung W.J. Lester R.A. tom Dieck S. Langnaese K.

M., Koivuranta, K. T., Miinalainen, I. J., Yagi, A. I., Schmitz, W., Kastaniotis, A. J., Airenne, T. T., Gurvitz, A., and Hiltunen, K. J. (2001) Mol. Cell. Biol. 21, 6243–6253), revealed the clone AA393871 (HsNrbf-1, nuclear receptor binding factor 1) in human EST data bank. Expression of HsNrbf-1, tagged C-terminally with green fluorescent protein, in HeLa cells, resulted in a punctated fluorescence signal, superimposable with the MitoTracker Red dye. Wild-type polypeptide was immunoisolated from the extract of bovine heart mitochondria. Recombinant HsNrbf-1p reduces trans-2-enoyl-CoA to acyl-CoA with chain length from C6 to C16 in an NADPH-dependent manner with preference to medium chain length substrate. Furthermore, expression of HsNRBF-1 in the ybr026cΔ yeast strain restored mitochondrial respiratory function allowing growth on glycerol. These findings provide evidence that Nrbf-1ps act as a mitochondrial 2-enoyl thioester reductase, and mammalian cells may possess bacterial type fatty acid synthetase (FAS type II) in mitochondria, in addition to FAS type I in the cytoplasm.

The eukaryotic extracytosolic FASs, like the fungal mitochondrial (1Schneider R. Brors B. Burger F. Camrath S. Weiss H. Curr. Genet. 1997; 32: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 2Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E.

Biochem. 1982; 123: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) systems, are similar to the prokaryotic type of FAS (type II) in terms of having a set of separate monofunctional enzymes (5Rock C.O. Cronan J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) in contrast to the eukaryotic cytosolic FAS (type I), which consists of multifunctional polypeptide(s) (6Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 7Kolodziej S.J. Penczek P.A. Schroeter J.P. Stoops J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28422-28429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fatty acid chain elongation in the mammalian and fungal endoplasmic reticulum also resembles FAS type II, except for the facts that it is membrane-associated (8Cinti D.L. Cook L. Nagi M.N. Suneja S.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and has CoA as an acyl group carrier instead of acyl carrier protein (ACP). The properties of the eukaryotic FASs and their role in metabolism appear to vary depending on the organism and the subcellular organelle; this is analogous to the β-oxidation of fatty acids. Although both mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation perform chain shortening of acyl-CoA substrates, the kinetic properties of the enzymes differ, and they clearly do not represent a metabolic redundancy, as exemplified by inborn errors of fatty acid oxidation (for review see Ref. 9Wanders R.J. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 32: 89-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The disruption of any of the mitochondrial FAS type II genes in yeast results in a respiration-deficient phenotype (1Schneider R. Brors B. Burger F. Camrath S. Weiss H. Curr. Genet. 1997; 32: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 2Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 10Harington A. Schwarz E. Slonimski P.P. Herbert C.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5531-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), although the cytosolic FAS is still operational. Also the mitochondrial FAS in the yeast cannot compensate for a defective cytosolic pathway, and the inactivation of the cytosolic FAS is lethal, unless the cells are supplemented with fatty acids in the culture media (11Schweizer E. Bolling H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 660-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have recently identified a novel type of 2-enoyl thioester reductase from Candida tropicalis (Etr1p) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ybr026p) that is involved in mitochondrial FAS (12Torkko J.M. Koivuranta K.T. Miinalainen I.J. Yagi A.I. Schmitz W. Kastaniotis A.J. Airenne T.T. Gurvitz A. Hiltunen K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6243-6253Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The ybr026cΔ strain exhibits reduced mitochondrial cytochrome contents and an inability to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources (13Yamazoe M. Shirahige K. Rashid M.B. Kaneko Y. Nakayama T. Ogasawara N. Yoshikawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast FAS type II 2-enoyl thioester reductases are homodimeric, NADPH-dependent, and are not sequence-related to the homotetrameric reductases of bacterial FAS type II. Rat nuclear receptor binding factor-1 (RnNrbf-1p), which was described as homolog of the Ybr026p/Mrf1′p by protein data base searches, was observed previously to interact with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α as well as with a number of other nuclear receptors in the yeast two-hybrid assay (14Masuda N. Yasumo H. Furusawa T. Tsukamoto T. Sadano H. Osumi T. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the current work open reading frames (ORF) encoding the human homolog (HsNrbf-1p) of the rat Nrbf-1p was identified in human EST data bank, and the cDNA encoding the bovine homolog (BtNrbf-1p) was cloned. The data demonstrated that Nrbf-1ps are mitochondrial proteins that catalyze an NADPH-dependent reduction of trans-2-enoyl thioesters to the corresponding saturated acyl thioesters. As the expression of human NRBF-1 in the ybr026cΔ yeast strain rescues the respiration-deficient phenotype, it is concluded that Nrbf-1ps are the orthologs of the yeast 2-enoyl thioester reductases, enzymes previously unidentified in mammals. Isolation of Human NRBF-1 cDNA and Northern Blot Analysis—The S. cerevisiae gene YBR026c was used to search for human EST clones in the expressed sequence tag data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. An EST clone, AA393871 (IMAGE ID 504485), was obtained from I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (UK Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Centre, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK) and sequenced. The ORF of the AA393871 (HsNRBF-1) clone was amplified with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the primer pair HsNRBF-1comp5′ (5′-GAG CTCTAGAAG ATG TGG GTC TGC AGT ACC C-3′) and HsNRBF-1comp3′ (5′-CG AGCTCGAGT TCA CAT GGT GAG AAT CTG CTT-3′), which introduced XbaI and XhoI sites (underlined) to the ends of the predicted ORF. The nucleotide triplets encoding an initiating starting methionine and stop codon are indicated in the oligonucleotides with boldface letters. The resulting DNA fragment was subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) (pSK) vector (Stratagene). cDNA was removed from the pSK vector by digestion with XbaI and XhoI and ligated into similarly digested pYE352 behind the S. cerevisiae catalase A (CTA1) promoter (15Filppula S.A. Sormunen R.T. Hartig A. Kunau W.H. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27453-27457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), resulting in pYE352::HsNRBF-1. For Northern blot analysis, a human Multiple Tissue Northern Blot™ (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) containing poly(A+) RNA from various human tissues was hybridized with 32P-labeled HsNRBF-1 cDNA. Human β-actin cDNA (supplied with the kit) was used as a control probe. Hybridization was done in ExpressHyb™ (Clontech) solution according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the hybridized fragments were visualized by autoradiography at -70 °C for 24 h using X-Omat™ AR imaging film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Cloning of the NRBF-1 cDNA from Bovine Heart—The total RNA was isolated from bovine heart tissue using QuickPrep system (Amersham Biosciences). cDNA was amplified from isolated RNA with RobustRT-PCR kit (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland), which contains a high fidelity DyNAzyme EXT, using the primer pair BtNRBF1–5′ (5′-TGG AGG GAA CAT GTG GG-3′) and BtNRBF1–3′ (5′-ATC ACA T(G/A)G TGA GAA TCT GCT T-3′). The composition of the BtNRBF1–5′ was based on the sequence of bovine EST clone BE682523, containing the 5′ end of the cDNA obtained by the data base search with the full-length human NRBF-1 sequence. The composition of the BtNRBF1–3′ was based on the consensus sequence obtained from the alignment of human, rat, and mouse sequences. The PCR product was ligated to pSTBlue vector using Acceptor Vector kit (Novagen, Madison, WI), and both strands of the insert were sequenced. The resulting plasmid was named pSTBlue::BtNRBF-1. Overexpression and Purification of Recombinant Human and Bovine Nrbf-1p—To produce the recombinant, truncated variant of HsNrbf-1p, which was deleted for 31 N-terminal amino acid residues, based on the amino acid sequence comparison to the mature form of Mrf1-p (13Yamazoe M. Shirahige K. Rashid M.B. Kaneko Y. Nakayama T. Ogasawara N. Yoshikawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nucleotides 90–1119 from AA393871 were amplified with primers HsNRBF1-PET3a-5′ (5′-TT TTT TTT CATATG GCC TCC TCC TAC TCC GCA TCC-3′) and HsNRBF1-PET3a-3′ (5′-TTT TTT TTT CATATGTCA CAT GGT GAG AAT CTG CTT TGA AGA TAT G-3′), containing NdeI sites (underlined). After digestion with NdeI, the resulting PCR product was cloned into NdeI-digested pET3a vector (Novagen) to generate pET3a::trHsNRBF1. The bovine construct was generated by amplifying nucleotides 95–1124 from pSTBlue::BtNRBF1, deleting also 31 N-terminal residues, with primers BovETR5′ (5′-TT TTT TTT CATATG TCC GCC TCC TTC TCT GCC-3′) and BovETR3′ (5′-TTT GGATCCTCA CAT GGT GAG AAT CTG CTT TGA AGA CAC-3′), which contained initiation and termination codons (boldface) within the coding sequence and NdeI (BovETR5′) and BamHI (BovETR3′) sites (underlined). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and NdeI and ligated into similarly digested pET3a vector to obtain pET3a::trBtNRBF1. After verification of the sequences and orientation of the inserts, the plasmid DNA was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells and the expression of the recombinant protein was induced in M9ZB medium by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 1.0 mm according to the manufacturer's protocol. After incubation for an additional 10 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed and stored at -20 °C until used. Although the immunological cross-reaction of the antibodies raised against Etr1p from C. tropicalis (anti-Etr1pAb; Ref. 12Torkko J.M. Koivuranta K.T. Miinalainen I.J. Yagi A.I. Schmitz W.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6243-6253Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with mammalian homologs was weak, the antibody could be used for monitoring the purification of recombinant HsNrbf-1p; in the meantime an antibody to HsNrbf-1p (anti-HsETRAb) was raised and used to monitor the purification of recombinant BtNrbf-1p. Bacterial cells (6 g wet weight) were resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mmN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine, pH 9.1, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm benzamide hydrochloride (BA), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) (buffer A) and disrupted using a French press (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY) at 32,000 pounds/square inch pressure. The disrupted cell suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g (+4 °C) for 30 min, and the supernatant containing 13 mg/ml of protein was applied to an anion exchange Q-Sepharose column (3.0 × 8.0 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. The flow-through fractions, which contained the protein cross-reacting with anti-Etr1pAb, were dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, and applied to a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B column (1.0 × 10.0 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm benzamide hydrochloride, 0.5 mm DTT. Bound proteins were eluted with an 80-ml linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 2.0 m, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing immunodetectable HsNrbf-1p were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.1, 50 mm NaCl and applied to a cation exchange Resource S column (volume 6 ml) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.1, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm benzamide hydrochloride, 0.5 mm DTT. Bound proteins were eluted with a 60-ml linear NaCl gradient from 50 mm to 1 m at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The fractions containing HsNrbf-1p were pooled, concentrated with Biomax-10 Ultra-free Centrifugal Filter Unit (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3. The bovine recombinant protein was purified following the protocol used for the human protein. 2-Enoyl Thioester Reductase Activity and Reaction Product Analysis—Enoyl reductase activity was measured using trans-2-hexenoyl-CoA (60 μm), synthesized by the mixed anhydride method (16Rasmussen J.T. Borchers T. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) as described previously (17Dommes V. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1781-1788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For end product analysis 3 μg of recombinant trHsNrbf-1p was incubated in the presence of 60 μmtrans-2-hexenoyl-CoA and 300 μm NADPH in 1 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, at 22 °C. Taken aliquots of 100 μl were acidified with 10 μl of 2 m HCl, and samples of 20 μl from the aliquots were subjected to a reversed phase chromatography (Waters Novapak C18, 2 × 150 mm, Waters 626 pump, Waters 996 photodiode array detector, Waters Millipore, Millford, MA). The column was eluted with an isocratic flow of 0.2 ml/min with buffers A (25 mm CH3COONH4, pH 5.5) and B (80% CH3CN and 25 mm CH3COONH4, pH 5.5) in 83:17 ratio. Metabolites in the eluted peaks were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) (ABI Voyager-DETM STR Biospectrometry Workstation). Determination of Kinetic Parameters for HsNrbf-1p—The kinetic constants for reductase activities were determined using substrate concentrations of 1.25–200 μm for trans-2-hexenoyl-CoA, trans-2-decenoyl-CoA, and trans-2-hexadecenoyl-CoA. Otherwise the assay mixture contained 125 μm NADPH and 100 μg of bovine serum albumin in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, in a final volume of 1 ml at 22 °C. The kinetic data were transferred to Lineweaver-Burk plots by using GraFit computer software (Sigma). The catalytic turnover numbers were obtained by dividing the maximum velocities with the enzyme (subunit) concentrations in the reaction mixtures. pEGFP-N1::HsNBRF-1 Construct for Localization Studies—Full-length HsNRBF-1 cDNA was amplified from pYE352::HsNRBF-1 with the primer pair HsNRBF-EGFP5′ (5′-TT GAATTC ATG TGG GTC TGC AGT ACC CTG-3′) and HsNRBF-EGFP3′ (5′-TTT GGTACC CAC ATG GTG AGA ATC TGC TTT GAA G-3′), with EcoRI and KpnI sites (underlined) at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA sequence, respectively. The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI and KpnI, gel-purified, and subcloned in-frame with the 5′ end of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA in the expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) resulting in pEGFP-N1::HsNRBF-1. Fluorescence Microscopy—Attached HeLa cells (CCL-2; American Type Culture Collection) were grown on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The transfection of the HeLa cells was done using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics), according to the manufacturer's protocol, and using 6 μl of FuGENE 6 with 2 μg of either pEGFP-N1::HsNRBF-1 or pEGFP-N1. After transfection the cells were grown for 36 h and treated with the mitochondrion-selective fluorescent dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes Europe BV, Leiden, Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 14 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (PBS) for 20 min at 22 °C. To minimize the background fluorescence, the fixed cells were incubated in 50 mm NH4Cl/PBS for 10 min before treatment with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min at 22 °C. Nuclear DNA was counterstained with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI), and the mounted (IMMU-MOUNT; Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA) slides were examined using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus Optica, Hamburg, Germany). Images were recorded with a CCD camera and processed with the Jasc Software Paint Shop Pro. Isolation of Rat Heart Mitochondria—Crude mitochondria fraction from rat heart was isolated as described (18Ylitalo K. Ala-Rami A. Vuorinen K. Peuhkurinen K. Lepojarvi M. Kaukoranta P. Kiviluoma K. Hassinen I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The bacterial protease (Nagarse) used was from Sigma. Mitochondrial pellet was suspended to a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 250 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm EDTA, giving a protein concentration of 23 mg/ml. An aliquot of mitochondrial fraction (46 mg of protein) was purified further by isopycnic density gradient centrifugation (19Neat C.E. Thomassen M.S. Osmundsen H. Biochem. J. 1981; 196: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) on a self-generated Percoll (Sigma) gradient (20Hakkola E.H. Autio-Harmainen H.I. Sormunen R.T. Hassinen I.E. Hiltunen J.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1863-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with an initial Percoll concentration of 32% (v/v). Gradient was generated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min in Beckman VTi50 rotor using slow acceleration/deceleration mode. Gradient was unloaded in 2-ml fractions from the bottom of the tube, and marker enzyme activities, cytochrome c oxidase (21Wharton D.C. Tzagaloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 245-250Crossref Scopus (1331) Google Scholar), esterase (22Beaufay H. Amar-Costesec A. Feytmans E. Thines-Sempoux D. Wibo M. Robbi M. Berthet J. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), and lactate dehydrogenase (23Vassault A. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods in Enzymatic Analysis. III. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1983: 118-126Google Scholar) for mitochondria, microsomes, and cytosol, respectively, were measured. Isolation of Wild-type BtNrbf-1p—The mitochondria were isolated from bovine heart, obtained from a local slaughterhouse as described earlier (24Sanadi D.R. Pharo R.L. Sordal L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 297-302Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and stored at -70 °C until used. The soluble mitochondrial extract was prepared by disrupting 2 g of mitochondria by sonication in 20 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, containing 70 mm NaCl at 0 °C, followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. A sample of supernatant containing 120 mg of protein was dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, and applied to a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B column (1.0 × 7.0 cm) equilibrated with dialysis buffer at the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The bound proteins were eluted with a NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.4 m (10 ml) and from 0.4 to 2 m (10 ml). The steep part of the gradient was implemented to prevent the excess dilution of BtNrbf-1p, as detected by immunoblotting with anti-HsETRAb. The fractions containing BtNrbf-1p were pooled, dialyzed against PBS, and subjected to immunoisolation. A suspension of 100 μl of protein A-coated Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) was washed three times with 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.2, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 10 μl of anti-HsETRAb or preimmune serum. The antibody-loaded beads were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and transferred using the PickPen magnetic particle transfer device (Bio-Nobile, Turku, Finland) to a 400-μl aliquot of the dialyzed sample containing BtNrbf-1p (catalyzing the reduction of 60 μmtrans-2-decenoyl-CoA at the rate of 0.6 nmol/min). After incubation at 4 °C with gentle shaking the beads were separated, washed three times with PBST, and transferred to 20 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm DTT. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the beads were removed, and the sample was acetylamidated with 110 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h at 37 °C. After electrophoresis, bands were excised, destained, and dried. The gel pieces were rehydrated with trypsin solution (20 μg/ml porcine trypsin in 40 mm NH4CO3 containing 10% (v/v) CH3CN and 0.5% (w/v) β-octyl-d-glucoside) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Digested peptides were recovered by extraction with four 20-μl aliquots of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water containing 5, 30, 50, and 70% CH3CN, respectively. Extracts were pooled, dried, and dissolved into 5 μl of saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 40% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS. Transmission EM of ybr026cΔ Cells Expressing HsNrbf-1p—For the electron microscopy studies S. cerevisiae ybr026cΔ cells overexpressing HsNrbf-1p or trHsNrbf-1p were transferred from overnight cultures in synthetic medium lacking uracil and containing 2% (w/v) d-glucose (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar) to oleic acid medium (26Gurvitz A. Rottensteiner H. Kilpelainen S.H. Hartig A. Hiltunen J.K. Binder M. Dawes I.W. Hamilton B. J. Biol.

BJ 1991 wild-type cells and ybr026cΔ cells were grown overnight on 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, and 2% (w/v) d-glucose and then transferred to oleic acid medium. The cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, pelleted, and immersed in 2% agar (w/v) in PBS. Yeast cells in agar blocks were further post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (w/v), dehydrated in acetone, and embedded in Embed 812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). Thin sections of 80 nm were cut with a Reichert Ultracut ultramicrotome and examined using a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope. Others—The generation of the S. cerevisiae BJ1991 ybr026cΔ strain used in the transformations with pYE352::HsNRBF-1 or pYE352::trHsNRBF-1 has been described previously (27Chen D.C. Yang B.C. Kuo T.T. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Transformed yeast strains were maintained on synthetic medium lacking uracil (SC-U) and supplemented with 2% (w/v) d-glucose and tested for complementation on SC-U containing 3% (w/v) glycerol as a nonfermentable carbon source. Antibody against human Nrbf-1 was raised by immunizing rabbits with purified recombinant HsNrbf-1p. The IgG fraction from the antisera was purified by using the Econo-Pac Serum IgG purification kit (Bio-Rad). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Hertfordshire, UK) or from Amersham Biosciences. The use of laboratory animals was approved by the committee on animal experimentation of the University of Oulu. Data Base Search, Tissue Distribution of the Expression, and Amino Acid Sequence Alignment—A BLAST search (28Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) of protein data bases with S. cerevisiae Ybr026p/Mrf1′p or C. tropicalis Etr1p revealed homologs from various eukaryotes, including human (Fig. 1). The corresponding human protein EST, AA393871, was sequenced, and the ORF was termed HsNRBF-1. A genomic data base search showed that the human genome contains only a single copy of the HsNRBF-1 gene annotated as CGI-63/NRBF-1. The gene is located in section p22.3 of chromosome 1 spanning over 37 kb and contains 10 exons and 9 introns. The expression of HsNRBF-1 was analyzed in different human tissues by Northern blot analysis. The strongest signals of 1.4 kb for HsNRBF-1 were observed in the samples from skeletal and heart muscles (Fig. 2A). Weak signals of the same size were observed in the samples from brain, placenta, liver, kidney, and pancreas, but no signal was observed in the sample from lung. Hybridization with a β-actin probe was used as a control for the amount of mRNA on the nylon blot (Fig. 2B). Two mRNAs of β-actin were visualized in heart and skeletal muscle, namely a band of 2 kb size and a smaller one of 1.6–1.8 kb size as observed previously (29Lamballe F. Klein R. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 66: 967-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 30Pari G. Jardine K. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4796-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because the Northern blot analysis indicated that the NRBF-1 was expressed in heart muscle, this tissue was chosen as a material for characterization of the mammalian Nrbf-1p originating from a wild-type source. The BtNRBF-1 cloned from bovine heart was 1133 bp long and contained an open reading frame of 1122 nucleotides, encoding a polypeptide of 373 amino acid residues. The similarities between human and bovine Nrbf-1p sequences were 88 and 85% at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively. The amino acid sequence identities between HsNrbf-1p (Bt- Nrbf-1p) and Ybr026p and Etr1p were 40 (35%) and 36% (38%), respectively, and 80% (83%) to Rattus norvegicus Nrbf-1p (14Masuda N. Yasumo H. Furusawa T. Tsukamoto T. Sadano H. Osumi T. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). An amino acid identity of 42% (44%) was obtained with the annotated Ybr026p homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans. Fig. 1 shows that the identical/similar amino acid residues in these proteins formed clusters, which were found along the length of the polypeptides excluding the extreme N and C termini. The tyrosine residue critical for catalysis in the yeast enzymes (31Airenne T.T. Torkko J.M. Van den Plas S. Sormunen R.T. Kastaniotis A.J. Wierenga R.K. Kalervo Hiltunen J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) is also conserved in the mammalian protein (Tyr-94 in HsNrbf-1p). Overexpression and Purification of HsNrbf-1p and BtNrbf-1p—To characterize further the functions of HsNrbf-1p and BtNrbf-1p, their variants deleted for the predicted mitochondrial targeting signals were overexpressed from a pET3a vector in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures,” yielding from 6.0 to 8.8 mg of protein from 2 liters of the bacterial culture. SDS-PAGE analysis showed a single protein band of 37 kDa, which is in agreement with the mass of predicted polypeptides (37,052 Da and 36,973 Da) encoded by HsNRBF-1 and Bt- NRBF-1 in pET3a. Size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 HR column gave an estimated native mass of 65 kDa (Fig. 3), indicating that both proteins are homodimers. Enzymatic Properties of 2-Enoyl Thioester Reductase—The amino acid sequence similarity of HsNrbf-1p and BtNrbf-1p with C. tropicalis Etr1p and S. cerevisiae Ybr026p prompted us to test whether they have a similar enzymatic activity. Therefore, HsNrbf-1p was incubated in the presence of trans-2-hexenoyl-CoA and NADPH, and samples were taken from the reaction at various time points for HPLC analysis (Fig. 4, panel 1). The oxidation of NADPH was accompanied by the disappearance of trans-2-hexenoyl-CoA with a concomitant accumulation of a metabolite (Fig. 4, panel 2, A–C) having the same retention time as hexanoyl-CoA (Fig. 4, panel 3, A–C).

The physiological relevance of NHERF binding to CFTR is not fully understood. Individuals with mutations resulting in premature termination of CFTR (S1455X or Δ26 CFTR) have moderately elevated sweat Cl– concentration, without an obvious lung and pancreatic phenotype, implying that the CFTR function is largely preserved. Surprisingly, when expressed heterologously, the Δ26 mutation was reported to abrogate channel activity by destabilizing the protein at the apical domain and inducing its accumulation at the basolateral membrane (Moyer, B., Denton, J., Karlson, K., Reynolds, D., Wang, S., Mickle, J., Milewski, M., Cutting, G., Guggino, W., Li, M., and Stanton, B.

The goals of this study were to resolve the contrasting clinical and cellular phenotype of the Δ26 CFTR mutation and evaluate the role of NHERF in the functional expression of CFTR at the plasma membrane. Complex formation between CFTR and NHERF was disrupted by C-terminal deletions, C-terminal epitope tag attachments, or overexpression of a dominant negative NHERF mutant. These perturbations did not alter CFTR expression, metabolic stability, or function in nonpolarized cells. Likewise, inhibition of NHERF binding had no discernible effect on the apical localization of CFTR in polarized tracheal, pancreatic, intestinal, and kidney epithelia and did not influence the metabolic stability or the cAMP-dependent protein kinase-activated chloride channel conductance in polarized pancreatic epithelia. On the other hand, electrophysiological studies demonstrated that NHERF is able to stimulate the cAMP-dependent protein kinase-phosphorylated CFTR channel activity in intact cells. These results help to reconcile the discordant genotype-phenotype relationship in individuals with C-terminal truncations and indicate that apical localization of CFTR involves sorting signals other than the C-terminal 26 amino acid residues and the PDZ-binding motif in differentiated epithelia.

CFTR consists of two homologous halves, each comprising a transmembrane (TM) domain and a nucleotide binding domain, connected by the highly charged regulatory domain (3Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M.

Based on 8-azido-ATP-binding/hydrolysis assays, the C-terminal boundary of nucleotide binding domain 2 seems to extend to amino acid 1420 (4Gentzsch M. Aleksandrov A. Aleksandrov L. Riordan J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), implying that the C-terminal tail encompasses approximately the last 60 amino acid residues (1420–1480) of CFTR. Compelling evidence suggests that the C-terminal tail is engaged in a variety of intra- and intermolecular interactions. The C terminus contains a tyrosine-based (1424YDSI) and a dileucine-based (1430LL) internalization motif, ensuring clathrin binding via the AP-2 adaptor protein and constitutive internalization via a clathrin-dependent pathway (5Prince L.

Finally, high affinity association of multivalent PDZ domain-containing molecules with the conserved C-terminal peptide (1476DTRL) has been demonstrated (12Wang S. Raab R. Schatz P. Guggino W. Li M.

PDZ domain-containing proteins bind to short C-terminal peptides of membrane receptors, ion channels, and signaling complexes and are grouped into two classes based on the target sequence. Class I PDZ domains recognize the sequence motif (S/T)X(V/I/L)T, identified also at the C terminus of CFTR (1476DTRL), whereas Class II domains recognize the motif (F/Y)X(F/V/A) (15Harris B. Lim W.

The role of the PDZ domain-containing CFTR-associated ligand, the 70-kDa CFTR-associated protein, and the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF)/ezrinradixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein of 50 kDa in the regulation of CFTR has been extensively studied (17Kleizen B. Braakman I. de Jonge H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 544-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). CFTR-associated ligand down-regulates CFTR expression by impeding its biosynthetic processing at the Golgi compartment (14Cheng J. Moyer B. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J. Cutting G. Li M.

Channel activation is facilitated by a conformational change of CFTR induced by binding to the multivalent NHERF and 70-kDa CFTR-associated protein, as found in excised inside-out patches (13Wang S.

Furthermore, NHERF may promote the phosphorylation of CFTR by tethering PKA and protein kinase Cϵ to the vicinity of the channel (28Sun F. Hug M. Lewarchik C. Yun C. Bradbury N. Frizzell R. J. Biol.

This hypothesis was supported by the observation that deletion of the last 26 amino acids of CFTR provoked the accumulation of the channel at the lateral membrane in MDCK II and bronchial epithelia (32Moyer B.

Individuals harboring the Δ26 CFTR on one allele and a nonsense mutation on the second allele have only moderately elevated sweat chloride concentration without obvious pancreatic and pulmonary phenotype (36Mickle J.

Genet. 1998; 7: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), implying the involvement of other factors in addition to NHERF and the C terminus in the apical targeting of CFTR. In an attempt to gain more insight into the role of the C terminus in CFTR physiology and to provide an explanation for the contrasting clinical and cellular phenotype, biochemical and functional aspects of the truncated CFTR were examined. Whereas association of NHERF with the C-terminal tail of CFTR could be confirmed in vitro and in vivo, disruption of the complex had no discernible effect on the apical localization of CFTR in epithelia derived from the trachea, pancreatic duct, intestine, as well as the distal tubule of the kidney. No significant alteration in the apical halide conductance of pancreatic duct cells expressing the truncated CFTR was observed, providing a plausible explanation for the mild clinical phenotype of the truncated CFTR at the cellular level. Plasmid Constructions—Carboxyl-terminal fragments of the CFTR cDNA, comprising the deletion of the last 6, 40, 50, and 60 amino acid residues (designated as Δ6, Δ40, Δ50, and Δ60 CFTR) were generated by PCR (antisense primers, 5′-C CCC CCC TCG AGC TAC TCT TCT TCT GTC TCC-3′, 5′-AA AGG GCC CTA GGC TTG CCG GAA GAG GC-3′,5′-AA AGG GCC CTA CAG TTT CTG GAT GGA ATC G-3′,5′-AA AGG GCC CTA TTT GTT CTC TTC TAT GAC C-3′, and 5′-TGC AAG AAT GGC CAA CTC TCG CC-3′, respectively, and a sense primer, 5′-A AAG GGC CCG CTA GCA TTC CAG CAT TGC TTC-3′) and inserted into the PmlI/ApaI sites of the pCDNA3 plasmid, encoding the N terminus HA-tagged CFTR as described previously (11Haardt M.

To stably transfect BHK cells, mutants were subcloned into pNUT-CFTR expression plasmid. All mutants were sequence-verified. To express CFTR in PANC-1 epithelia, WT and Δ6 CFTR were subcloned into the pMT/EP episomal expression cassette, provided by Dr. J. Ilan (37Trojan J. Johnson T. Rudin S. Blossey B. Kelley K.

CFTR-GFP fusion was constructed by shuttling the HpaI/SalI fragment of the pEGFP-N3 vector (BD Biosciences) into pNUT-CFTR-HACt after eliminating the hemagglutinin (HA) tag. To confer NHERF binding capacity, short flexible linker and the last six amino acids of CFTR (GGGVQDTRL) were fused by PCR mutagenesis to the C terminus of the CFTR-GFP, resulting in the pNUT-CFTR-GFPDTRL expression cassette. The influenza HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was either attached to the last amino acid of CFTR via linker sequence containing an XhoI restriction site (CFTR-HACt) or inserted into the C-terminal tail after Phe1450 (CFTR-HACi) by replacing amino acid residues between 1451 and 1460. Insertion of three tandem HA epitopes in the fourth extracellular loop of CFTR will be described elsewhere. GST-Ct61 expression plasmid was constructed by subcloning the cDNA of the last 61 amino acids of CFTR into the XhoI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T3.

BHK cells expressing CFTR were also transfected with the pBK vector encoding the HA-tagged NHERF, D1, and D2 domain by the calcium phosphate method. Stable cell lines were selected in 500 μm methotrexate and 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). PANC-1 cells, transfected with the pMT/EP expression cassette encoding the WT or Δ6 CFTR, were selected in the presence of hygromycin (0.2 mg/ml). COS-1 cells, maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, were transiently transfected by FuGene (Roche Applied Science) or LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) at 60% confluence and analyzed after 48 h. MDCK II cells were transfected by FuGene (Roche Applied Science) or Effectene (Qiagen) at 60–70% confluence, trypsinized after 24 h, and seeded on 12- or 25-mm Transwell polycarbonate filters (0.4-μm pore size) at 80–90% confluence. Sweat duct cells, kindly provided by Dr. Paul Quinton, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and growth factors. To ensure the development of differentiated monolayers, experiments were performed after culturing the epithelia for 3–5 days at confluence. Differentiation of the epithelia was verified by the accumulation of occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) at tight junctions, by transepithelial electrical resistance measurement and polarized release of iodide (39Mohamed A. Ferguson D. Seibert F. Cai H. Kartner N. Grinstein S. Riordan J. Lukacs G. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Domain-specific fluorescence labeling of filter-grown MDCK II by rhodamine-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin also ruled out the presence of paracellular leak. Retroviral Infection—Retroviral expression plasmid was constructed by shuttling the cDNA encoding the CFTR-EGFP into the NotI site of the retroviral expression vector pFBneo (Stratagene). The pFB-CFTREGFPDTRL was constructed by overlapping PCR mutagenesis inserting the coding sequence of amino acids QVDTRL. Virus stock was generated by transient cotransfection of the CFTR expression plasmid together with the pVpack GP and pVpack vesicular stomatitus virus glycoprotein (Stratagene) packaging plasmids into the HEK 293T cell, using the FuGene transfecting reagent. Viral supernatant was harvested 24 h later. MDCK II, CaCo-2, and HTE epithelia were infected at 50% confluence by incubating the cells in 2 ml of viral supernatant supplemented with 8 μg/ml polybrene for 12 h and then in normal medium for 48 h. The infected cells were seeded on semipermeable filter and examined by fluorescence microscopy after 3–14 days. Isolation of Recombinant Proteins—GST and GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal tail of CFTR were expressed in E. coli (HB101) upon induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for3hat37 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication (model XL 2015 Heat Systems; Ultrasonics Inc.) in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm EDTA, supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.2 μm leupeptin, 0.2 μm pepstatin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 1 mmdl-dithiothreitol. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min) and applied to a glutathione Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column. After washings, GST and GST fusion proteins were dissociated by the elution buffer (50 mm reduced glutathione, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and 0,1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and dialyzed against PBS. For pull-down assays, fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (1 h at 4 °C), washed with PBS, and incubated for an additional 2 h in the presence of the indicated protein extract. Beads were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and eluted by 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—CFTR expression in COS-1 cells was visualized by the mouse monoclonal anti-HA Ab (Covance Research Products 16B12, 1:1000 dilution) and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary Ab as described (40Lechardeu, D., Drzymala, L., Sharma, M., Zylka, D., Kinach, R., Pacia, J., Hicks, C., Usmani, N., Rommens, J., and Lukacs, G. (2000) 150, 321–334Google Scholar). Fluorescence staining of MDCK II cells grown on polycarbonate filters was performed after fixing (3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min), permeabilizing (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min), and incubating the cells for 10 min in 100 mm glycine in PBS at room temperatures. Filters were cut out, blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and incubated in primary and secondary antibodies for 2 h at 37 °C. Primary antibodies were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-HA (Covance Research Products 16B12) at 1:250 dilution, rat polyclonal anti-ZO-1 (Chemicon, Inc.) at 1:50 dilution, mouse monoclonal anti-E-cadherin (kindly provided by Dr. W. Gallin, University of Alberta, Edmonton) at 1:250 dilution, and mouse monoclonal anti-gp135 (kindly provided by Dr. S. Hansen, Boston Biomedical Research Institute) at 1:250 dilution. Rhodamine- and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rat secondary antibodies were applied at 1:500 dilution (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Fluorescence micrographs were obtained by a Zeiss LSM 510 laser fluorescence confocal microscope as described (40Lechardeu, D., Drzymala, L., Sharma, M., Zylka, D., Kinach, R., Pacia, J., Hicks, C., Usmani, N., Rommens, J., and Lukacs, G. (2000) 150, 321–334Google Scholar). Confocal images were scanned using a 0.6–0.9-μm pinhole and the multitrack scanning mode. No spillover of the fluorescein and rhodamine signals could be detected. X-Z projections were reconstructed from the horizontal optical sections. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Cells were washed with icecold PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, pH 8.0) containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin, 10 mm iodoacetamide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 20 min at 4 °C. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min at 4 °C). Soluble proteins were separated on 7–10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were probed with the mouse monoclonal anti-HA Ab at 1:10,000 dilution, the M3A7 anti-CFTR Ab at 1:1000 dilution (kindly provided by Dr. N. Kartner (41Kartner N. Riordan J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 629-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)), or the monoclonal mouse 24–1 anti-CFTR Ab (Genzyme Inc.) at 1:1000 dilution and visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) as described (10Benharouga M. Haardt M. Kartner N. Lukacs G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—The protocol of pulse-chase labeling was similar to our previously published ones (10Benharouga M. Haardt M. Kartner N. Lukacs G. J.

Briefly, transfected BHK cells were depleted in cysteine- and methionine-free α-minimal essential medium, pulse-labeled in the presence of 0.1–0.2 mCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min, and then chased for the indicated time at 37 °C in complete medium. Metabolically labeled CFTR was isolated by immunoprecipitation, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography. Radioactivity associated with CFTR was measured by phosphor-imaging analysis as described (10Benharouga M. Haardt M. Kartner N. Lukacs G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Iodide Efflux Measurements and Electrophysiology—Iodide efflux was performed essentially using the protocol described for BHK and MDCK I monolayers (39Mohamed A. Ferguson D. Seibert F. Cai H.

However, based on the observation that INH-treated Mycobacterium tuberculosis overproduces KasA, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of mycolic acids, and induces the formation of a covalent complex consisting of AcpM, KasA, and INH, it has been proposed that KasA represents the primary target of INH. However, the relevance of this complex to INH action remains obscure. This study was aimed at clarifying the role of InhA and KasA in relation to INH activity. By using anti-KasA antibodies we detected the KasA-containing complex in INH-treated Mycobacterium smegmatis. In addition, INH-treated cells also produced constant levels of KasA that were not sequestered in the complex and presumably were sufficient to ensure mycolic acid biosynthesis. Interestingly, a furA-lacking strain induced the complex at lower concentrations of INH compared with the control strain, whereas higher INH concentrations were necessary to induce the complex in a strain that lacks katG, suggesting that INH needs to be activated by KatG to induce the KasA-containing complex. The InhA inhibitors ethionamide and diazaborine also induced the complex; thus, its formation was not specifically relevant to INH action but was because of InhA inhibition. In addition, in vitro assays using purified InhA and KasA demonstrated that KatG-activated INH, triclosan, and diazaborine inhibited InhA but not KasA activity. Moreover, several thermosensitive InhA mutant strains of M. smegmatis constitutively expressed the KasA-containing complex. This study provides the biochemical and genetic evidence. 1) Only inhibition of InhA, but not KasA, induces the KasA-containing complex. 2) INH is not part of the complex. 3) INH does not target KasA, consistent with InhA being the primary target of INH.

Despite its seemingly simple structure and the discovery over 50 years ago that INH is highly active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (1Fox H.H. Science. 1952; 116: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2Bernstein J. Lott W.A. Steinberg B.A. Yale H.L. Am. Rev. Tuberc. 1952; 65: 357-374PubMed Google Scholar), the elucidation of its precise mode of action has been difficult. Middlebrook (3Middlebrook G. Am. Rev. Tuberc. 1952; 65: 765-767PubMed Google Scholar) was the first to carefully quantify the bactericidal activity of INH. Although Winder and Collins (4Winder F.G. Collins P.B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1970; 63: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) demonstrated that INH inhibits mycolic acid biosynthesis, Takayama et al. (5Takayama K. Wang L. David H.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1972; 2: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) demonstrated that inhibition of mycolic acid biosynthesis correlates with cell death. Takyama et al. (6Takayama K. Schnoes H.K. Armstrong E.L. Boyle R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1975; 16: 308-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) further demonstrated that the inhibition of mycolic acid biosynthesis mediated by INH leads to the accumulation of a saturated C26 fatty acid within 1 h of INH treatment. By using scanning electron microscopy, it was established that M. tuberculosis treated with INH undergoes a defined order of molecular events that leads to lysis 24 h after initiation of treatment, thus after approximately one cell generation (7Takayama K. Wang L. Merkal R.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1973; 4: 62-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The events that lead from the inhibition of mycolic acid biosynthesis and the accumulation of a saturated C26 fatty acid to cell lysis are still poorly understood. Moreover, there exists controversy as to which enzymes of the mycolic acid biosynthetic pathway are the actual targets of INH. The mode of action of INH appears to be rather complex and requires activation by the mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase KatG (8Zhang Y. Heym B. Allen B. Young D. Cole S. Nature. 1992; 358: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 9Johnsson K. Schultz P J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 7425-7426Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Activation of the pro-drug leads to reactive radicals that exert a toxic effect on the tubercle bacillus (9Johnsson K. Schultz P J. Am. Chem.

Presumably activated INH inhibits one or more targets of the mycolic acid biosynthetic pathway which eventually leads to cell death. At least two enzymes have been identified as potential targets of activated INH, the enoyl-ACP reductase InhA (12Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quémard A. Balasubramanian V. Um K.S. Wilson T. Collins D. de Lisle G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Science. 1994; 263: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar) and the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase KasA (13Mdluli K. Slayden R.A. Zhu Y. Ramaswamy S. Pan X. Mead D. Crane D.D. Musser J.M. Barry III, C.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The inhA gene was first identified by conferring co-resistance to INH and ethionamide (ETH) after overexpression in mycobacteria (12Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quémard A. Balasubramanian V. Um K.S. Wilson T. Collins D. de Lisle G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Science. 1994; 263: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in inhA confer resistance to both INH and ETH in drug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates (14Heym B. Honoré N. Truffot-Pernot C. Banerjee A. Schurra C.

Biochemical analyses have revealed InhA to be the NADH-specific enoyl-ACP reductase of the fatty-acid synthase II system (FAS-II), which elongates long chain fatty acids for the synthesis of mycolic acids (18Quémard A.

Microbiology. 2000; 146: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This enzymatic activity can be inhibited by activated INH (21Johnsson K. King D.S. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem.

Dis. 1998; 178: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed that the resistance-conferring mutations map to the NADH-binding pocket and that activated INH binds to NAD+, forming an INH-NAD adduct that specifically inhibits InhA (10Rozwarski D.A. Grant G.A. Barton D.H.R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1998; 279: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 19Dessen A. Quémard A. Blanchard J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1995; 267: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Consistent with InhA being the target of INH, a combination of genetic and biochemical studies on a thermosensitive Mycobacterium smegmatis inhA mutant indicated that InhA inactivation is sufficient to cause lysis by a mechanism similar to that induced by INH treatment, as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy (23Vilchèze C. Morbidoni H.R. Weisbrod T.R. Iwamoto H. Kuo M. Sacchettini J.C. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4059-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Despite these lines of evidence, the role of InhA as the primary target of INH has been questioned for three reasons. 1) Inactivation of InhA could not readily account for the accumulation of a saturated C26 fatty acid in M. tuberculosis observed upon INH treatment. 2) No covalent binding of INH to InhA has been detected. 3) A failure to transfer INH resistance by overexpression of inhA in M. tuberculosis casted doubt on the relevance of M. smegmatis as a suitable surrogate host to study INH resistance in M. tuberculosis. Therefore, Mdluli et al. (24Mdluli K. Sherman D R. Hickey M.J. Kreiswirth B.N. Morris S. Stover C.K. Barry III, C.E. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 1085-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) suggested that InhA is not the major primary target for activated INH in M. tuberculosis and proposed the β-ketoacyl-AcpM synthase KasA as the primary target, as they found that treatment of M. tuberculosis with INH induced the overexpression of KasA and the formation of an 80-kDa complex consisting of INH, AcpM, and KasA. It was also suggested that KasA inactivation results in the accumulation of a saturated C26 fatty acid (13Mdluli K. Slayden R.A. Zhu Y. Ramaswamy S. Pan X. Mead D. Crane D.D. Musser J.M. Barry III, C.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In addition, four mutations in the kasA gene were found in INH-resistant clinical isolates (13Mdluli K. Slayden R.A. Zhu Y. Ramaswamy S. Pan X. Mead D. Crane D.D. Musser J.M. Barry III, C.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have supported that InhA can account for all the observations. First, a temperature-sensitive mutation in inhA was used to demonstrate that InhA inactivation leads to an accumulation of saturated FAS-I end product (23Vilchèze C. Morbidoni H.R. Weisbrod T.R. Iwamoto H. Kuo M. Sacchettini J.C. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4059-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and the three-dimensional structure of the INH-NAD+ adduct binding to InhA explained the lack of direct covalent binding of radioactive INH to InhA (10Rozwarski D.A. Grant G.A. Barton D.H.R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1998; 279: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies have clearly demonstrated that overexpression of inhA confers resistance to INH and ethionamide in M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, and M. smegmatis. In contrast, little evidence has accumulated supporting KasA as a target for INH, although independent studies (25Lee A.S. Lim I.H. Telenti A. Wong S.Y. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2087-2089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Piatek A.S. Telenti A. Murray M.R. El-Hajj H. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Kramer F.R. Alland D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) have reported that three of the four kasA alleles have been found in M. tuberculosis isolates that are fully susceptible to INH. To date, no one has performed a gene transfer experiment demonstrating that any of these mutations confer INH resistance to susceptible strains of mycobacteria. Furthermore, the failure of overexpression of kasA in M. bovis BCG (27Kremer L. Douglas J.D. Baulard A.R. Morehouse C. Guy M.R. Alland D. Dover L.G. Lakey J.H. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Brennan P.J.

Microbiol. 2000; 38: 514-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) which raises doubts as to whether KasA plays a relevant role in INH action. Clearly, additional in vivo and in vitro studies are required in order to determine the potential role of KasA and the participation of the proposed ternary AcpM-KasA-INH complex in INH and ETH resistance. In this study we re-examined the potential involvement of InhA or KasA as major primary targets of activated INH, and we tested the hypothesis that InhA inactivation through any mechanism leads to the accumulation of the 80-kDa AcpM-KasA complex. Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions—The mycobacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I.

Meier A. Böttger E.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, the katG gene was first inactivated by the insertion of a hygromycin resistance cassette and subsequently cloned into a suicide vector containing the wild-type rpsL gene. This construct was then electroporated into M. smegmatis SMR5 strain, a derivative of mc2155, which contains a recessive mutant rpsL allele that confers resistance to streptomycin. The replacement of wild-type katG gene by katG::hyg, reflecting a double cross-over event, was selected by picking colonies that were resistant to both hygromycin and streptomycin. This gene replacement was verified by PCR analysis of the recombinant clones. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Roche Applied Science, and Vent DNA polymerase was purchased from New England Biolabs. All DNA manipulations were performed using standard protocols, as described earlier (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Drug Susceptibility Testing of M. smegmatis—The susceptibility to INH, ETH, cerulenin (CER), diazaborine (DZB), triclosan (TRC), and isoxyl (ISO) on M. smegmatis was determined by performing serial 10-fold dilutions of the cultures on Middlebrook 7H10 agar containing 10% oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase enrichment and increasing concentrations of the drugs. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the minimal concentration required to completely inhibit 99% of mycobacterial growth after incubation at 37 °C for 3–4 days. Production and Purification of Recombinant M. tuberculosis Proteins—Recombinant His-tagged KasA, mtFabD, holo-AcpM, and palmitoyl-AcpM were produced in E. coli C41(DE3) containing the relevant expression vectors and purified by affinity chromatography using a His-Trap column (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (33Kremer L.

Tu S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2520-2526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Purified M. tuberculosis InhA was kindly provided by GlaxoSmithKline. Preparation of Anti-KasA and Anti-InhA Immune Sera—Rat anti-KasA antibodies were obtained as reported previously (36Kremer L. Guérardel Y. Gurcha S.S. Locht C. Besra G.S. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3145-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-InhA antibodies were produced as follows. A His-tagged version of InhA (10Rozwarski D.A. Grant G.A. Barton D.H.R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1998; 279: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) was prepared by His-trap Ni2+-chelating chromatography. After this chromatographic step, InhA was further purified to near-homogeneity by size exclusion chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) on a Superdex-200 column. Purified InhA was dialyzed against Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), containing 150 mm NaCl. 1 mg of His-tagged InhA (1 mg/ml) was mixed with 1 ml of TitermaxR gold adjuvant (Sigma). A rabbit was immunized subcutaneously with 400 μg of His-tagged InhA (100 μg of protein per site) in a final volume of 400 μl. The first booster was given 21 days after the primary immunization. During the first booster 200 μg of protein (50 μg per site) was injected in the animal. Sera were collected 10 days after the first booster, and the presence of anti-InhA antibodies was verified by immunoblot analysis. A second booster was given (200 μg of protein) 15 days after the first booster. The rabbits were bled, and sera were prepared. Preimmune sera were collected before immunization. Immunoblotting—Ten-milliliter aliquots of culture were harvested at mid-log phase. Cells were then resuspended in 0.8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 20 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl) and disrupted for 10 min using a Branson Sonifier 450. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of proteins (20 μg) were then separated on a SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a Hybond-C Extra membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was then saturated with 5% dry milk in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, incubated overnight with either rat anti-KasA antibodies (1:500 dilution) or rabbit anti-InhA antibodies (1:30,000 dilution), washed, and incubated with anti-rat antibodies or anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:7000 dilution; Promega), respectively. In Vivo Effects of INH on Mycolic Acid Synthesis—M. smegmatis was grown to mid-log phase, and INH was added at various concentrations followed by incubation at 37 °C for 4 h. 1 μCi/ml of [1,2-14C]acetate (50–62 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) then was added to the cultures followed by further incubation at 37 °C for 4 h. The 14C-labeled cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g and washed with PBS. Extraction of the 14C-labeled fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and mycolic acid methyl esters (MAMEs) has been reported previously (34Kremer L. Dover L.G. Carrère S. Nampoothiri K.M. Lesjean S.

The amounts stated correspond to those for a single reaction, which was scaled up proportionately to the number of assays performed. Holo-AcpM (40 μg) was incubated on ice for 30 min with β-mercaptoethanol (0.5 μmol) in a total volume of 40 μl. [2-14C]Malonyl-CoA (6.78 nmol, 0.045 μCi; Amersham Biosciences), mtFabD (40 ng), and 25 μl of 1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were added. The reaction mixture was held at 37 °C for 20 min to allow mtFabD to catalyze transacylation of holo-AcpM with malonyl-CoA to provide malonyl-AcpM (33Kremer L. Nampoothiri K.M. Lesjean S. Dover L.G.

C16-AcpM (22.5 μg) was then added to afford a final volume of 89 μl. The reaction was then dispensed according to single assay mixtures into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. The drugs were then immediately added, 1 μl per reaction. All drugs were dissolved in Me2SO apart from TRC and CER, which were dissolved in 1 m NaOH and ethanol, respectively. Control reactions containing 1 μl of the appropriate solvent were carried out. When KatG-activated INH was used, KatG was diluted to 80 μg/ml in 30 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, containing 150 μm NADH. INH was added at the same time, and the mixture was held at ambient temperature for 150 min before assaying, and a 10-μl sample of this reaction mixture was incorporated into the assay. A 10-μl aliquot of KasA (0.25 μg) was added to the reaction mixture that was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of 2 ml of NaBH4 reducing solution converting the β-keto-[14C]C18-AcpM product into a [14C]C18-1,3-diol. The reducing solution was prepared freshly and consisted of 5 mg/ml NaBH4 in 0.1 m K2HPO4, 0.4 m KCl, and 30% (v/v) tetrahydrofuran (38Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2094288810,"In chromaffin cells, exocytosis of single granules and properties of the fusion pore--the first connection between vesicular lumen and extracellular space --can be studied by cell-attached patch amperometry, which couples patch-clamp capacitance measurements with simultaneous amperometric recordings of transmitter release. Here we have studied exocytosis of single chromaffin granules and endocytosis of single vesicles in cell-free inside-out membrane patches by patch capacitance measurements and patch amperometry. We excised patches from chromaffin cells by using methods developed for studying properties of single ion channels. With low calcium concentrations in the pipette and bath, the patches showed no spontaneous exocytosis, but exocytosis could be induced in some patches by applying calcium to the cytoplasmic side of the patch. Exocytosis was also stimulated by calcium entry through the patch membrane. Initial conductances of the fusion pore were undistinguishable in cell-attached and excised patch recordings, but the subsequent pore expansion was slower in excised patches. The properties of exocytotic fusion pores in chromaffin cells are very similar to those observed in mast cells and granulocytes. Excised patches provide a tool with which to study the mechanisms of fusion pore formation and endocytosis in vitro."

The yeast Rab5 ortholog Vps21p is activated by its guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vps9p. Here we show that Vps9p binds ubiquitin and that the CUE domain is necessary and sufficient for this interaction. Vps9p ubiquitin binding is required for efficient endocytosis of Ste3p but not for the delivery of the biosynthetic cargo carboxypeptidase Y to the vacuole. In addition, Vps9p is itself monoubiquitylated. Ubiquitylation is dependent on a functional CUE domain and Rsp5p, an E3 ligase that participates in cell surface receptor endocytosis. These findings define a new ubiquitin binding domain and implicate ubiquitin as a modulator of Vps9p function in the endocytic pathway.

These findings define a new ubiquitin binding domain and implicate ubiquitin as a modulator of Vps9p function in the endocytic pathway. Rab proteins are critical regulators of the vesicle targeting and fusion events (reviewed in Refs. 1Pfeffer S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: e17-e22Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar and 2Zerial M. McBride H.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2709) Google Scholar). Discrete classes of these small GTPases mediate very specific transport events, showing little if any functional overlap. For example, the Rab5 family members appear to be involved exclusively in targeting events within the early stages of the endocytic pathway (3Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 4Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). The activation of Rab5 GTPases like all Rab proteins is dependent on the state of bound nucleotide, GDP or GTP. Two classes of proteins that modulate the Rab nucleotide occupancy are the GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase activating protein; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; Ub, ubiquitin; MBP, maltose-binding protein; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; CPS, carboxypeptidase S. and the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). GAPs stimulate GTP hydrolysis, leaving the Rab in the GDP-bound, inactive state; conversely, GEFs initiate GDP release to permit GTP binding and thereby Rab activation. Multiple GAPs and GEFs for the Rab proteins have been identified, and an interesting distinction has been observed (reviewed in Ref. 5Segev N. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2001; 13: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The Rab GAPs share a conserved sequence motif and exhibit substrate promiscuity among the Rab families (6Du L.L. Collins R.N. Novick P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3253-3256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7Albert S. Gallwitz D. J. Biol.

Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In contrast, the GEF proteins for different Rab families are dissimilar at the sequence level and show great specificity for their cognate Rab proteins. Consequently, the GEFs appear to be the primary mechanism to control specific Rab activity. A number of exchange factors for Vps21p/Rab5 family members have been identified in mammalian and yeast systems. In yeast, Vps9p is the exchange factor for the Rab5 ortholog Vps21p (9Hama H. Tall G.G. Horazdovsky B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15284-15291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). VPS9 was initially identified in genetic screens for mutants defective in vacuolar protein sorting (10Burd C.G. Mustol P.A. Schu P.V. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2369-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In vitro reconstitution of Vps9p-stimulated GDP release and GTP loading onto Vps21p demonstrated that Vps9p is the GEF for Vps21p (9Hama H. Tall G.G. Horazdovsky B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15284-15291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Concurrently, Rabex5 was identified as a Rab5-binding protein and demonstrated to exhibit in vitro GEF activity (11Horiuchi H. Lippe R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Wilm M. Ashman K. Mann M. Zerial M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In addition to conserved functions in activating Rab5 proteins, yeast Vps9p (451 amino acids) and human Rabex5 (491 amino acids) share 27% overall sequence identity (11Horiuchi H. Lippe R.

A peptide comprised of residues 158–347 of Vps9p was identified as the domain necessary and sufficient for GEF catalytic activity. 2G. G. Tall, D. S. Carney, and B. F. Horazdovsky, manuscript in preparation. Although Vps9p is the only known GEF for Vps21p in yeast, six human proteins have been identified with the Vps9 domain in addition to human Rabex5 (SMART data base) (12Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P.

Genome Res. 2001; 11: 422-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The coincidence of these signaling motifs with the Vps9 domain suggests that these proteins serve as key integrators of signal transduction pathways and the receptor endocytosis machinery. This concept has been demonstrated for the Rab5 GEF, Rin1 (15Tall G.G. Barbieri M.A. Stahl P.D. Horazdovsky B.F. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In contrast to Rin1, the mechanisms regulating Vps9p and Rabex5 are unclear. Here we provide evidence that ubiquitin binding and monoubiquitylation regulate yeast Vps9p. The CUE domain of Vps9p is shown to mediate an interaction with ubiquitin, and we show that this interaction is required to potentiate Vps9p function in endocytic traffic to the vacuole. We demonstrate that Vps9p is monoubiquitylated and that this modification is dependent on CUE-dependent ubiquitin binding and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Rsp5p. Together, these findings identify a novel role for ubiquitin in regulating endocytosis by the Vps21p/Rab5 exchange factor Vps9p.

For expression of His6HA-Ub and His6Vps21, Escherichia coli were cultured at 37 °C, induced with 500 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, and harvested after 4 h of protein production at 37 °C. For the remaining protein fusions, cultures were shifted from 37 °C to room temperature prior to induction with 500 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside and harvested after 10–15 h of protein production at room temperature. MBP-protein fusions were affinity purified with amylose resin following the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). His6-tagged proteins were affinity purified with Ni-NTA-agarose following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Inc, Valencia, CA), and His6Vps9p was further purified with the Bioscale Q2 column following the manufacturer's recommended conditions (Bio-Rad). Protein fusions were concentrated, and buffer was switched to 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl and stored at –80 °C for later use. Ubiquitin Binding Assay—Putative ubiquitin-binding protein (MBP-Vps9p, MBP-Vps9p M419A; 4 μg ml–1) was incubated with either His6HA-ubiquitin (13 μg ml–1) or bovine serum albumin (5 μg ml–1) in 1 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm KOAc with protease inhibitors (N-tosyl-l-phenlalanine-chloromethyl ketone, Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine-chloromethyl ketone, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and trypsin inhibitor)) with Ni-NTA-agarose (40 μl). Binding reactions were incubated for >1 h at 4 °C in a Rotator. The Ni-NTA-agarose was then washed six times with 1 ml of binding buffer. 50 μl of elution buffer (binding buffer with 200 mm imidazole) was added, and the samples were incubated for 10 min on ice. The supernatant was transferred, 5× Laemmli sample buffer (0.312 m Tris, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 25% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The eluate material was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Western analyses were performed with Vps9p (1: 2,000) or Rabex5 (1:1,000) antisera or HA.11 monoclonal antibody (1: 10,000), appropriate HRP-conjugated antibody (1:2,000), and SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (1:4 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). Analysis of Vps9 CUE domain ubiquitin binding was conducted similarly except that His6Vps21p (equimolar to His6HA-Ub) was used as the negative control, binding buffer was 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, 300 mm KOAc, and Western analysis utilized MBP antiserum (1:5,000; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Whole Cell Western Analysis—Yeast strains were grown in YPD or yeast nitrogen base-glucose with appropriate amino acids, and 1 A600 equivalent was harvested during log-phase growth (0.5–0.8 A600 ml–1). Samples were resuspended in 100 μl of 5× Laemmli sample buffer, and ∼150 μl of glass beads (0.5 mm) were added. Samples were vortexed in mass for 10 min and heated at 95 °C for 4 min. 0.1 A600 equivalent was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Western analysis was performed with Vps9p antiserum (1:2,000), HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1: 2,000), and SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (1:4 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). CPY Immunoprecipitation Assay—CPY immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described previously (23Horazdovsky B.F. Cowles C.R. Mustol P. Holmes M. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33607-33615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown in YNB-glucose and labeled at 30 °C for 10 min with EasyTag Expre35S35S protein labeling mix (30 μCi A600–1) before the addition of excess methionine and cysteine. Following the 30-min chase, samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 10%) and resuspended in boiling buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). Glass beads were added, samples were vortexed, and CPY was isolated as described previously. Immunoprecipitated material was resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. Ste3p Degradation Assay—Yeast strains harboring the pRS414 Ste3HA plasmid were grown in YNB-glucose, 0.2% yeast extract with appropriate amino acids past log growth phase. Cultures were diluted to 0.2 A600 ml–1 and cultured for 4 h. Three A600 equivalents were harvested and resuspended at 1 A600 ml–1 in YNB-glucose, and cyclohexamide (1 mg ml–1 in ethanol) was added to 1.3 μg ml–1. 0.5 A600 equivalents were removed at 0, 20, 40, and 60 min after cyclohexamide addition, and NaN3 and NaF were added to 10 mm. Samples were resuspended in 100 μl of 2× urea sample buffer (6 m urea, 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue), and ∼150 μl of glass beads (0.5 mm) were added. Samples were vortexed in mass for 10 min and heated at 65 °C for 4 min. An additional 100 μl of 2× urea sample buffer was added, and samples were subjected to centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 rpm. 0.05 A600 equivalent was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Western analysis was performed with HA.11 monoclonal antibody (1:5,000), HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:2,000), and SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (1:5 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). The ABI computing densitometer 300A was used with ImageQuant V1.2 for quantitation. Similar degradation patterns were observed when analyses were performed using Ste3p antiserum (from G. Payne, UCLA) to detect endogenous receptors, indicating that the Ste3HA reporter recapitulates Ste3p trafficking (data not shown). In Vivo Ubiquitylation Assay—Yeast strains harboring the pGPD416 HA-ubiquitin plasmid were grown in YNB-glucose with appropriate amino acids. 10 A600 equivalents were harvested in late log growth phase (∼1 A600 ml–1) and resuspended in 100 mm Tris, pH 9.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol. Following a 10-min room temperature incubation, samples were resuspended in spheroplasting buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 m sorbitol, 1× YNB, 4% glucose, 1× amino acids, 100 μg ml–1 zymolase 100T) and incubated 10 min at 30 °C. Samples were osmotically lysed in 10 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0, with Roche Molecular Biochemicals EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture. The lysate was then cleared by a 10-min, 16,000 × g spin at 4 °C. The cleared lysate was then adjusted to ∼25 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 2% glycerol, and 50 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose was added. Samples were incubated for >1 h at 4 °C and washed four times with wash buffer (50 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol). 100 μl of elution buffer (wash buffer with 200 mm imidazole) was added, and the samples were incubated for 10 min on ice. The supernatant was transferred, 5× Laemmli sample buffer was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The eluate material was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Western analyses were performed with penta-His (1:2,000) or HA.11 antibody (1:10,000), HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:2,000), and SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (1:1 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay—The in vitro ubiquitylation assay was modified from Huibregtse et al. (34Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3656-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). MYY290 (RSP5) and MYY808 (rsp5ts) cultures were grown in YPD at 25 °C to ∼5 A600 ml–1. Pelleted yeast were resuspended in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl with protease inhibitors (N-tosyl-l-phenlalanine-chloromethyl ketone, Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine-chloromethyl ketone, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and trypsin inhibitor). The samples were frozen at –80 °C, thawed, and lysed by vortexing with glass beads. The lysate was then cleared by a 5-min, 16,000 × g spin. The 20-μl ubiquitylation reaction was set up on ice with 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm ATP, MYY290 or MYY808 cleared lysate (0.8 mg ml–1), His6Vps9p (0.34 mg ml–1), His6hE1 (3.25 μg ml–1; generously provided by J. Chen laboratory, UTSW), MBP-Ubc5p (0.8 mg ml–1), with or without MBP-Rsp5p (27 μg ml–1), added. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h and terminated with the addition of 5× Laemmli sample buffer and incubation at 95 °C for 4 min. One-third of the reaction was then resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Western analysis was performed with Vps9p antiserum (1:2,000) or HA.11 monoclonal antibody (1:2,000), appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2,000), and SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (1:4 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). Vps9p CUE Domain Binds Ubiquitin—To identify potential regulators of Vps9p function, a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted using the carboxyl-terminal portion of Vps9p (amino acids 158–451). From this screen, ubiquitin was repeatedly isolated as a potent Vps9p interaction partner. The specificity of this interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system was verified using a variety of unrelated protein expression constructs (data not shown). This region of Vps9p contains a sequence motif called CUE (Fig. 1A). This domain (amino acids 408–450) (Fig. 1B) was originally identified by reiterative sequence homology searches initiated with the yeast protein Cue1p (35Ponting C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and can also be found in the SMART and PFAM databases (12Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). The CUE domain is found in organisms from yeast to humans (35Ponting C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B), but its functional role was not defined. Of the Vps21p/Rab5 GEF proteins, the canonical CUE domain has been identified in only S. cerevisiae Vps9p (Fig. 1A); however, human Rabex5 may also harbor a highly divergent CUE domain (37Donaldson K.M. Yin H. Gekakis N. Supek F. Joazeiro C.A.P. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 258-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). To confirm the Vps9p-ubiquitin interaction and to examine the role of the CUE domain in this interaction, an in vitro ubiquitin binding assay was utilized. A gene fusion between the MBP and VPS9 coding sequences was constructed, and the recombinant protein (MBP-Vps9p) was expressed in E. coli and affinity purified (Fig. 2A). A His6- and HA-tagged version of a human ubiquitin coding sequence was also constructed (His6-HA-Ub), expressed in E. coli, and affinity purified. MBP-Vps9p was then incubated with His6-HA-Ub (or bovine serum albumin as a control), and His6-HA-Ub, together with the potential His6-HA-Ub·MBP-Vps9p complexes, were isolated using Ni-NTA-agarose. Following extensive washing, His6-HA-Ub was eluted from the Ni-NTA-agarose with imidazole, and the presence of Vps9p in the eluate was determined by Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 2B, MBP-Vps9p copurified with His6-HA-Ub (lane 5). When bovine serum albumin was substituted for His6-HA-Ub, only a very small amount of MBP-Vps9p was detected representing the level of nonspecific association with the Ni-NTA resin (Fig. 2B, lane 4). These results confirm the Vps9p-ubiquitin interaction uncovered in the yeast two-hybrid screen. To explore the possibility that the CUE domain mediates the interaction between Vps9p and ubiquitin, an allele was generated in which the first residue of the highly conserved signature sequence MFP (35Ponting C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (methionine at position 419) was mutated to alanine (M419A) (Fig. 1B). The methionine was chosen for mutagenesis to minimize potential structural perturbations of this domain. MBP-Vps9p M419A was expressed in E. coli and affinity purified. Soluble protein yields from the M419A allele were equivalent to that of wild-type, suggesting that global protein folding and stability were largely unaffected (Fig. 2A) (see below). When the mutant protein was tested for its ability to bind ubiquitin, the M419A mutation precluded the ability of this protein to bind ubiquitin in vitro (Fig. 2B, lane 6). This finding indicates that the CUE domain is necessary for the Vps9p-ubiquitin association and suggests that th"
https://openalex.org/W2150355013,"We found an autoimmune serum, K199, that strongly suppresses nuclear membrane assembly in a cell-free system involving a Xenopus egg extract. Four different antibodies that suppress nuclear assembly were affinity-purified from the serum using Xenopus egg cytosol proteins. Three proteins recognized by these antibodies were identified by partial amino acid sequencing to be glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, and the regulator of chromatin condensation 1. GAPDH is known to be a fusogenic protein. To verify the participation of GAPDH in nuclear membrane fusion, authentic antibodies against human and rat GAPDH were applied, and strong suppression of nuclear assembly at the nuclear membrane fusion step was observed. The nuclear assembly activity suppressed by antibodies was recovered on the addition of purified chicken GAPDH. A peptide with the sequence of amino acid residues 70–94 of GAPDH, which inhibits GAPDH-induced phospholipid vesicle fusion, inhibited nuclear assembly at the nuclear membrane fusion step. We propose that GAPDH plays a crucial role in the membrane fusion step in nuclear assembly in a Xenopus egg extract cell-free system.

NE breakdown during the mitotic prophase results in the dispersal of both nuclear membranes into the mitotic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network. Inner nuclear membrane proteins such as lamin B receptor, lamina-associated polypeptide 2β, and emerin reconcentrate on the surface of decondensing chromatin during the late anaphase, and then the NE is re-formed (1Bodoor K.

These intrinsic membrane proteins and lamins are believed to play a critical role in NE reassembly (3Gerace L. Burke B. Annu. Rev.

NE assembly can be studied in vitro using extracts of meiotic or mitotic cells (6Lohka M.J. Masui Y. Science. 1983; 220: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 7Burke B. Gerace L. Cell. 1986; 44: 639-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The assembly requires cytosolic factors and is inhibited by a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, N-ethylmaleimide, and a calcium chelator, BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid) (8Macaulay C. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 5-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In vitro, NE assembly is initiated by the binding of membrane vesicles to decondensed chromatin in an energy-independent manner (9Vigers G.P. Lohka M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 10Newport J. Dunphy W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 11Imai N. Sasagawa S.

Once bound to chromatin, membrane vesicles fuse and flatten. The insertion of nuclear pore complexes and the expansion of the NE require both energy and cytosolic components (12Marshall I.C.B. Wilson K.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).

After the formation of a closed NE around chromatin, further NE growth requires nucleocytoplasmic transport and further membrane fusion (8Macaulay C. Forbes D.J. J.

Chromosoma (Berl.). 1989; 98: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Analysis of membrane fractions of a Xenopus egg extract suggested that the population of vesicles required for NE assembly is not uniform and that different membranes might be required for different steps of the assembly process (9Vigers G.P. Lohka M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Wilson K.L. Newport J. J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).It was shown recently that p97, an ATPase previously implicated in the fusion of the Golgi and transitional endoplasmic reticulum membranes together with adaptor p47, has two discrete functions in NE assembly (23Hetzer M. Meyer H.H. Walther T.C. Bilbao-Cortes D. Warren G. Mattaj I.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The formation of a closed NE requires a p97·Ufd1·Npl4 complex and subsequent NE growth involves a p97·p47 complex (23Hetzer M. Meyer H.H. Walther T.C. Bilbao-Cortes D. Warren G. Mattaj I.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that trans-SNARE complexes implicating p97 might be not the terminal catalysts of membrane fusion (24Mayer A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Rather, their role seems to be confined to an intermediate stage of the reaction, probably docking of the two lipid bilayers (24Mayer A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, the components causing lipid bilayer fusion events remain unclear.NE assembly, which includes the lipid bilayer fusion step, comprises complicated reactions, and many proteins should participate in these reactions. Therefore, if we could obtain specific antibodies against these proteins, we would have very powerful tools for analyzing the reaction mechanism. It is known that autoimmune disease sera react with many proteins in the NE (25Konstantinov K. Foisner R. Byrd D. Liu F.-T. Tsai W.-M. Wiik A. Gerace L. Clin. Immunol.

Rep. 1996; 23: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and cytosol fractions. We applied such sera to an in vitro Xenopus egg extract nuclear assembly system and found that most sera suppressed the assembly to various extents. Then we selected one serum, K199, that strongly suppresses the nuclear assembly and contains antibodies reactive with proteins in the Xenopus egg extract.In this study, we purified five antibodies from K199 that suppress nuclear assembly. They reacted with GAPDH, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, RCC1, and another protein. GAPDH is known to be a fusogenic protein (i.e. a protein having the ability to merge phospholipid bilayers) in phospholipid vesicles containing phosphatidylserine (28Kaneda M. Takeuchi K. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1233-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29Glaser P.E. Gross R.W.

Therefore, we examined the effects of a peptide comprising the phosphatidylserine-binding site of GAPDH, which inhibits GAPDH-induced phospholipid vesicle fusion, and authentic antibodies against GAPDH on the nuclear assembly in a Xenopus egg extract. Suppression of the nuclear membrane fusion step was clearly caused by the peptide and antibodies. From these results we propose that GAPDH participates in the step of fusion of nuclear membrane vesicles on chromatin.MATERIALS AND METHODSAutoimmune Serum, Antibodies, Peptides, and Enzymes—K199 is serum from a patient with Sjögren's syndrome (Sjs), rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematous overlap. The IgG fraction of anti-human GAPDH (rabbit) was purchased from Trevigen and used without further purification. Polyclonal antibodies against a 15-amino acid synthetic peptide (FNFRLKAGQKIRFGC, amino acid residues 390–403) derived from Chinese hamster ovary cell phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD) was generated in rabbits as previously described (28Kaneda M. Takeuchi K. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1233-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The one thus-obtained polyclonal antibody, designated as aPSD-2, was further purified by affinity chromatography on a peptide column (28Kaneda M. Takeuchi K. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1233-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against a 25-amino acid synthetic peptide, GAPDH70 (KPITIFQERDPVKIKWGDAGAEYVC, the sequence of amino acid residues 70–94 of rat GAPDH), was generated in rabbits as previously described (28Kaneda M. Takeuchi K. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1233-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and purified by affinity chromatography on a peptide column (28Kaneda M. Takeuchi K. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1233-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Chicken GAPDH was obtained from Sigma (Tokyo).Preparation of Demembranated Sperm Chromatin—Demembranated sperm chromatin was prepared as described (33Takano M. Takeuchi M. Ito H. Furukawa K. Sugimoto K. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and stored at -80 °C at a concentration of 40,000/μl.Preparation of a Crude Extract and Membrane and Cytosol Fractions of Xenopus Eggs—Xenopus eggs were collected, removed from the jelly, and then lysed to prepare an interphase extract essentially as described (22Sasagawa S. Yamamoto A. Ichimura T. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The egg lysis buffer for the preparation of interphase extracts consisted of 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.7), 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2 supplemented with 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin immediately before use. Eggs were packed into tubes by brief centrifugation and then crushed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The crude extract was collected, mixed with 10 μg/ml cytochalasin B, and then further separated into cytosol, membrane-rich, and gelatinous pellet fractions by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 4 h. The cytosol fraction generated was then recentrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min to remove residual membranes, divided into 30-μl aliquots, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until use. The membrane fraction was resuspended in 10 volumes of cold lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 5 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin and then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h, with the resuspension and centrifugation steps repeated twice to remove residual cytosolic components. The membranes were resuspended in egg lysis buffer containing 500 mm sucrose to a final volume corresponding to ∼10% of the original volume of crude extract (10× membranes), divided into 10-μl aliquots, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored -80 °C until use.Nuclear Assembly Assays—Assays were performed essentially as described by Smythe and Newport (34Smythe C. Newport J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 449-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and Sasagawa et al. (22Sasagawa S. Yamamoto A. Ichimura T. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Frozen Xenopus egg extracts or cytosol and membrane fractions were rapidly thawed, supplemented with an ATP-regenerating system (10 mm phosphocreatine, 2 mm ATP (pH 7.0), and 5 μg/ml creatine kinase), and then mixed with demembranated sperm chromatin. The standard reaction mixture consisted of 10,000 chromatins and 10 μl of crude extract or 10 μl of cytosol + 1 μl of membrane. After incubation at room temperature (23 °C) for 1.5 h, a 2-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed and diluted with 2 μl of Hoechst/DHCC buffer (15 mm PIPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 0.2 m sucrose, 7 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA containing 20 mg/ml bisbenzimide DNA dye (Hoechst 33342; Calbiochem-Novabiochem), a lipid dye, 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DHCC; Aldrich), and 3.7% formaldehyde) on a glass slide. A fixed sample covered with a coverslip was examined by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy. An Axioplan (Carl Zeiss, Germany)-equipped fluorescence microscope with exciter-barrier reflector combinations suitable for these fluorescent dyes was used. Nuclear assembly (%) represents 100 × (number of nuclei)/(number of observed chromatins). Chromatin, of which the axial ratio is less than 2, was taken to be “nucleus-assembled.” For confocal microscopy, propidium iodide DNA dye and DHCC lipid dye were used, and images were recorded with a Radiance 2000 confocal fluorescent microscopy system (Bio-Rad) mounted on a Nikon E600 fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo). In the case of Fig. 2A, assembled nuclei were subjected to electron microscopy after fixation with glutaraldehyde (22Sasagawa S. Yamamoto A. Ichimura T. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The bars in the figure show the standard error.Pretreatment of Crude Extracts and Membrane Fractions with Antibodies—Xenopus egg crude extracts were incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with a 0.05 volume of K199 serum, eluted antibodies, or control phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mm NaCl, 8.10 mm Na2HPO4, 2.68 mm KCl, and 1.47 mm KH2PO4) before the addition of sperm chromatin. Nuclear assembly assays were then performed, and “nuclear assembly” (100 × (formed nuclei)/(observed chromatin) (%)) was measured at several time points by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy.SDS-PAGE, Silver Staining, and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE and silver staining were carried out according to the methods of Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar) and Morrissey (36Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar), respectively. For immunoblotting, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (8% gel) and then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) papers (Millipore Co.) at 2 mA/cm2 for 2 h with a semidry blotting apparatus in transfer buffer (100 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 5% methanol, 0.005% SDS). The PVDF papers were then cut into strips. The strips were subjected to sequential 3-h incubations at room temperature with diluted K199 serum followed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG antibodies (Wako Pure Chemicals) in blocking buffer 1 (5% skim milk in PBS). The primary antibodies were used at a 1:500 dilution, and the secondary ones were used at a 1:2000 dilution. Bound antibodies were detected either by development with PBS containing 0.2 mm 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.03% H2O2 or by means of the enhanced chemiluminescence method (SuperSignal West Pico kit; Pierce). The apparent molecular masses of proteins were estimated from their mobilities on SDS-PAGE using molecular mass standard proteins (myosin, phosphorylase b, bovine serum albumin, and ovalbumin).Affinity Purification of Antibodies—The method used was originally developed by Olmsted (37Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosol fractions and the subfractions obtained with a DEAE-5PW anion exchange column (Tosoh, Tokyo) or a Superdex 200HR gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (8% gel) and then electrotransferred or transferred by diffusion to PVDF papers. The PVDF papers were then blocked at 4 °C for 1 h with blocking buffer 2 (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS). The papers were then incubated with 1% K199 serum in blocking buffer 2 at 4 °C overnight, washed three times in PBS and water, and then cut into several portions according to the molecular weight ranges. Antibodies were eluted by incubating these portions for 3 min at 4 °C in 50 mm NaCl and 5 mm glycine (pH 2.8) followed by immediate neutralization with 500 mm Na2HPO4 containing 5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Each eluate was dialyzed for 8 h three times against 100 mm NH4OH-CH3COOH (pH 8.0), quickly frozen, and then lyophilized. The lyophilized affinity-purified antibodies were finally dissolved in PBS and used at 1:5 to 1:20 dilution to examine nuclear assembly inhibition.DEAE-5PW Anion Exchange Chromatography—An aliquot of the Xenopus egg cytosol fraction (6 mg of protein) diluted with 6 ml of 25 mm ammonium acetate (pH 8.3) was applied to a DEAE-5PW anion exchange column (7.5 × 75 mm, Tosoh, Japan) equilibrated with 25 mm ammonium acetate (pH 8.3) and then eluted with a 220-min stepwise gradient, from 0 to 100%, of 1 m ammonium acetate (pH 8.3). Analysis was performed at 0.5 ml/min and room temperature. The separated fractions were either lyophilized and solubilized with 10% SDS in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) for SDS-PAGE or subjected to Superdex 200HR gel filtration chromatography. The amount of protein derived from 6 mg of cytosol protein was defined as 1 unit.Superdex 200HR Gel Filtration Chromatography—Fractions obtained with a DEAE-5PW column were dialyzed for 8 h three times against 100 mm NH4OH-CH3COOH (pH 8.0) and then concentrated by either re-application to a small DEAE-5PW column or lyophilization. The concentrated samples were applied to a Superdex 200HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.1 m ammonium acetate (pH 8.3). Fractions were lyophilized and solubilized with 10% SDS in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) for SDS-PAGE.Partial Amino Acid Sequencing—The Xenopus egg cytosol fraction (11 ml, 204 mg of protein) was separated on a DEAE-5PW column, and the fractions obtained were further separated by Superdex 200HR gel filtration chromatography. The fractions were electrophoresed, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and gel slices containing protein bands of interest (about 8 μg each) were subjected to trypsin digestion as described previously (38Kawahire S. Takeuchi M. Gohshi T. Sasagawa S. Shimada M. Takahashi M. Abe T.K. Ueda T. Kuwano R. Hikawa A. Ichimura T. Omata S. Horigome T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The slices containing peptides were centrifuged after homogenization. Each supernatant was collected, concentrated by lyophilization, and then applied to a reversed-phase HPLC equipped with a silica base C8 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Capcel Pak C8 column; Shiseido, Tokyo). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 5–75% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The amino acid sequences of the isolated peptides were determined with a Protein Sequencer 470A (Applied Biosystems).Preparation of Fab Fragments of Anti-GAPDH—Anti-GAPDH was digested in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 10 mm EDTA containing 10 mm cysteine with immobilized papain (0.25 mg/ml papain cross-linked to 6% beaded agarose; Pierce) at 37 °C for 3 h. The reaction time for complete conversion of all antibodies to Fab fragments was determined in preliminary experiments. The resulting digest was dialyzed against 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, lyophilized, and then dissolved in PBS.RESULTSCharacterization of Autoimmune Serum K199 —It is known that a subset of patients with autoimmune diseases have autoantibodies against nuclei or nuclear envelopes. Thus, we examined whether or not such sera inhibit nuclear assembly in a Xenopus egg extract. Aliquots of a Xenopus egg extract were mixed with autoimmune sera and then subjected to the nuclear assembly assay. Most sera inhibited nuclear assembly to various extents. Sera showing strong inhibition and adequate for use as probes for studying nuclear assembly were found in cases of Sjs and other diseases. 2A. Inomata, I. Watanabe, S. Yokota, K. Miyachi, Y. Onozuka, N. Imai, F. Kikuchi, K. Inano, K. Furukawa, and T. Horigome, manuscript in preparation. In this study, we used the thus found serum, K199, which strongly suppresses nuclear assembly.A Xenopus egg crude extract was preincubated with control PBS, normal serum, or K199, and then nuclear assembly was examined with Xenopus sperm chromatin (Fig. 1A). When the egg extract was pretreated with K199 serum, nuclear assembly was strongly suppressed, although pretreatment with normal serum gave similar nuclear assembly activity to that of a control (Fig. 1A). When these samples were observed under a fluorescence microscope, chromatin was observed to have changed into spherical nuclei and to be surrounded by a continuous membrane stained with DHCC in egg extracts pretreated with control PBS and normal serum (Fig. 1B, 1 and 2, Lipid). However, chromatin did not change into spherical nuclei, although it became swollen in an egg extract pretreated with K199 (Fig. 1B, 3 and 4). The rim (Fig. 1B, 3, Lipid) and surface (Fig. 1B, 4, Lipid) of chromatin were stained discontinuously with DHCC. These data suggested that K199 inhibits the fusion of vesicles bound to chromatin. The thus-assembled nuclei and chromatin were observed under electron and confocal laser fluorescence microscopes (Fig. 2). Nuclei assembled with the control extract (Fig. 2A, a and e) and the extract preincubated with normal serum (Fig. 2A, b and f) were covered with a bi-layered nuclear membrane containing nuclear pore complexes. On the other hand, in the case of chromatin incubated with the K199-treated egg extract, the fusion of vesicles bound to chromatin was limited (Fig. 2A, c, d, g, and h). These results show that K199 inhibits the fusion of vesicles on chromatin during nuclear membrane assembly. The binding of vesicles to chromatin may also be suppressed partially by the serum (Fig. 2A, c and d). Samples treated by the same method were also observed under a confocal laser fluorescence microscope (Fig. 2B). When we focused on the surface of chromatin incubated with the K199-treated extract, it was shown that the nuclear envelope was not enclosed, and thus, “vesicular” or “reticular” lipid-staining on chromatin could be determined by this method. Therefore, we used confocal microscopy to verify the inhibition of the closed nuclear envelope formation in the following experiments. Then we attempted to purify antigens that react with K199 and participate in nuclear assembly using the combination of K199 and the nuclear assembly assay method.Fig. 1Suppression of nuclear assembly in a Xenopus egg crude extract cell-free system by an autoimmune serum, K199.A, a Xenopus egg crude extract was mixed with control PBS (squares), a normal serum (triangles), or K199 serum (circles) and then treated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Nuclear assembly assays were performed with the thus-treated crude extracts. Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were removed at the indicated times and then examined for nuclear assembly. B, a Xenopus egg crude extract was preincubated with control PBS (1), a normal serum (2), or K199 serum (3 and 4) at 4 °C for 90 min. Chromatin was added to the pretreated extracts or egg lysis buffer (5Ellenberg J. Siggia E.D. Moreira J.E. Smith C.L. Presley J.F. Worman H.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1193-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) followed by incubation at 23 °C for 90 min and observation under a fluorescence microscope after staining. The microscope was focused on the middle of nuclei and chromatin (1, 2, 3, and 5) or on the surface of chromatin (4). DNA, DNA stained with Hoechst 33342; Lipid, lipid stained with DHCC.

The membrane fractions were washed and combined with an untreated cytosol fraction, and nuclear assembly activity was examined. The membrane fractions treated with PBS, normal serum, and K199 showed very similar nuclear assembly activities (data not shown). These results suggest that the major antigens responsible for the nuclear assembly suppression are present in the cytosol but not in the membrane fraction.To determine the molecular mass range of the antigen(s) participating in nuclear assembly, antibodies in K199 serum were fractionated as follows. Xenopus egg cytosol proteins were electrophoresed and then transferred to PVDF papers. The papers were incubated with K199 serum. Antibodies bound to these papers were eluted after cutting each paper into five portions. Suppression of nuclear assembly by fractionated antibodies was examined (Fig. 3).

In concordance with its role in immune tolerance, AIRE is most strongly expressed in thymic epithelial cells and in cells of monocytic-dendritic lineage. The AIRE protein has been shown to function as a transcriptional regulator, however, the mechanisms regulating AIRE gene expression are not known. Here we have characterized the AIRE promoter region by identifying a minimal promoter region within 350 bp of the translation initiation codon. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transient transfections with mutated promoter constructs revealed a functional TATA box (-163 to -153) and binding sites for transcription complexes AP-1 (-307 to -296), NF-Y (-213 to -202), and Sp1 (-202 to -189). The presence of a 390-bp CpG island within the proximal promoter suggested that cytosine methylation has a role in transcriptional regulation of AIRE, which was supported by in vitro methylation experiments of promoter constructs. Sodium bisulfite sequencing showed a less methylated status of AIRE promoter in the thymic epithelial cell line TEC1A3 compared with HeLa and monocytic cells U937 and THP-1. Real-time PCR analysis showed that treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-azaCdR), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, up-regulated AIRE transcript levels in TEC1A3, U937, and HeLa cells and that even greater activations in TEC1A3 and U937 cells were observed using combined treatments with deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. These results suggest that AIRE gene expression is modulated through modifications in chromatin methylation and acetylation.

Subcellularly, AIRE is located in the cell nucleus and in nuclear dots resembling promyelocytic leukemia bodies (7Björses P. Pelto-Huikko M. Kaukonen J. Aaltonen J. Peltonen L. Ulmanen I. Hum. Mol.

The role of AIRE in tolerance mechanisms led us to investigate the transcriptional regulation of the AIRE gene. Here we have characterized the human AIRE gene promoter structure identifying a minimal promoter and its transcriptional control elements. We describe the methylation status of the AIRE promoter in several cell lines and demonstrate the up-regulation of AIRE mRNA as a response to 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-azaCdR) and trichostatin A (TSA) treatments. Cell Culture—COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. HeLa and TEC 1A3 (human thymic epithelial cell line) cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium. Human monocytoid cell lines, THP-1 and U937, were cultured in RPMI 1640. Media was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and a 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin mixture (BioWhittaker, Europe). Isolation of AIRE Promoter—A 1.2-kb genomic fragment containing the 5′-end region of the AIRE gene was isolated by PCR amplification from human genomic DNA. Nucleotide sequences for primers are listed in Table I. The 5′-flanking region of AIRE promoter was subcloned into the pHIV-LTR-luc plasmid (Prof. Kalle Saksela, University of Tampere, Finland) encoding firefly luciferase reporter gene and named as pAP1235. The promoter region in the pAP1235 construct was verified by sequencing.Table IPrimer sequences used in this studyNameSequence (5′ → 3′)PurposeaEMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; BS, bisulfite sequencingGR1/1FCGAGGCCAAGCGAGGGGCTGCCAGCloningGR1/1RGGACTATCCCTGGCTCACAGGGCCCloningPA1FTTTGCGGCCGCGAACACTCGTGCCCAGAGACCCloningPA2FTTTGCGGCCGCCCTGTCCAGGCCACAGCATCCCloningPA3FTTTGCGGCCGCTAGGGGCTCTCAGCTTGTGTGCloningPA4FTTTGCGGCCGCCACAGAGCGAGTCTCTGTCCCCloningPA5FTTTGCGGCCGCCCTCCATCACAGGGAAGTGTCCloningPA6FTTTGCGGCCGCGGAGCGGCCTTTGCTCTTTGCCloningPA1RTTTGGATCCGGGCGCGGGGACCCGGGGCTGCloningAIRE TATA boxGGTCGCGGGGGTCGAACAGCGGCGCGmutagenesisAIRE AP-1CTGGTGGGTGAGCAAGGCCAGGCCCGmutagenesisAIRE NF-YCTGGCCCTGATTAAGCGCCGGGGCGGAGmutagenesisAIRE Sp1GATTGGGCGCCGAAGCGAAGCGGCCTTTGCmutagenesisAIRE AP-1TGGTGGGTGAGTCAGGCCAGGCEMSAAIRE AP-1 mut.TGGTGGGAAAGTCAGGCCAGGCEMSAAP-1 consensusCGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAAEMSAAIRE NF-YGAGGCCCTGGCCCTGATTGGGCGCCGEMSAAIRE NF-Y mut.GGCCCTGATTAAGCGCCGGGGCEMSANF-Y consensusGAGATTAACCAATCACGTACGGTEMSAAIRE Sp1GGCGCCGGGGCGGAGCGGCCTTEMSAAIRE Sp1 mut.GGCGCCGAAGCGAAGCGGCCTTEMSASp1 consensusATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGCEMSABITSA 1 fwdGGATAGGGTTATATTTGGAAGTGABSBITSA 1 revCTAACTCACAAAACCTAAAAACAABSBITSA 2 fwdTGTTTTTAGTTTTTAAGGTAGTTGBSBITSA 2 revTACAACAATAAAAAAACACTATCCBSa EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; BS, bisulfite sequencing Open table in a new tab Computer Analysis—Transcription factor binding sites were predicted by using the MatchTM program, which uses TRANSFAC 5.0 matrices (core similarity 1.0 and matrix similarity 0.9). The presence of CpG islands was analyzed with the EMBOSS program CpGplot using the algorithms of Gardiner-Garden and Frommer (12Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2652) Google Scholar). According to this analysis, a CpG-rich region is defined as stretches of DNA in which both the moving average of percentage of G plus C nucleotides is greater than 50 and the moving average of observed/expected CpG is greater than 0.6. Construction of Deletion and Mutant Reporter Plasmids—The pAP1235 plasmid construct containing the 5′-flanking region was used as a template to synthesize a series of deletion reporter gene constructs. The forward and reverse primers containing NotI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively, were used in cloning of deletion constructs (Table I and Fig. 1). Site-directed mutagenesis of the pAP1235 construct was performed using the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). Mutations were introduced into putative DNA binding sites for the AP-1, NF-Y, and Sp1 transcription factors, as well as into the putative TATA box. Primer sequences used in site-directed mutagenesis are given below in Table I. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells (1.5 × 105) were transiently transfected with 2.5 μg of DNA (2 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector pEF-BOS (Prof. Kalle Saksela, University of Tampere, Finland)) using ExGen 500 transfection reagent (Fermentas) following the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, the cells were lysed to measure the luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). The luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency according to β-galactosidase activities. The transfections were performed in triplicate. Electrophoretic Mobility Gel Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were made from HeLa and TEC1A3 cells with the variation of the method of Dignam et al. (13Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 107 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) and left on ice for 15 min. The lysates were passed several times through a 25-gauge needle. The nuclei were recovered by brief centrifugation at full speed and resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin), followed by sonication and incubation on ice for 30 min. The reaction mix was centrifuged for 15 min at full speed, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -70 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The oligonucleotides used in EMSA are listed in Table I. Pre-binding of nuclear extract to poly(dI-dC) (Roche Applied Science) was carried out in a 10-μl reaction volume at 30 °C for 30 min in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, and 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). For competition experiments, unlabeled competing oligonucleotides at 100-fold molecular excess were included in preincubation mixture. For antibody supershift experiments, corresponding antibody (2 μg) was included in the preincubation mixture. Purified 32P-end-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide was then added to the reaction mix and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were subjected to native 4.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following the electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed for autoradiography (Kodak Biomax MS-1, Sigma). The Sp1 and AP-1 consensus oligonucleotides were purchased from Promega. The Sp1, pan-Jun, and pan-Fos antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-NF-YA and anti-NF-YB antibodies were a gift from Dr. Roberto Mantovani (University of Milano, Italy). In Vitro DNA Methylation—SssI methylase (New England BioLabs) was used to methylate AIRE promoter luciferase reporter construct pAP1235. Briefly, plasmid DNA was incubated with 1 unit of methylase per 1 μg of DNA in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.9, supplemented with 160 μmS-adenosylmethionine. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C overnight. The methylated plasmid DNA was purified through a Wizard DNA Clean-Up system (Promega) and transfected into TEC1A3 and COS-7 cells in parallel with the unmethylated pAP1235 construct. Genomic DNA Isolation—Genomic DNA was extracted from TEC1A3, HeLa, THP-1, and U937 cells according to Sambrook et al. (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, the genomic DNA was isolated by cell lysis with proteinase K (Promega) digestion and extraction with phenol/chloroform. After the precipitation, the genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes SmaI and SacI, separated on a 1.5% agarose gel with 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8), blotted on nylon membrane, and hybridized with the radioactive probe corresponding to the genomic sequence (-568 to -195 bp). After hybridization and subsequent washing, the filters were exposed to autoradiography film. Sodium Bisulfite Genomic DNA Sequencing—Bisulfite genomic sequencing was performed as described previously (15Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar, 16Grunau C. Clark S.J. Rosenthal A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e65-e77Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The genomic DNA (2 μg) was denatured in 0.3 m NaOH at 37 °C for 15 min. After the addition of 3 m sodium bisulfite (Sigma) and 10 mm hydroquinone (Sigma), samples were mixed, overlaid with mineral oil, and incubated at 50 °C for 16 h. The modified DNA was purified through the Wizard DNA Clean-Up system (Promega) and denatured by addition of 0.3 m NaOH at 37 °C for 15 min. The bisulfite-reacted DNA was precipitated and resuspended in 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and used immediately or stored at -20 °C. The sequence of interest in the bisulfite-reacted DNA was amplified by PCR in a reaction mixture containing 200 ng of DNA, 0.5 μm primers, 200 μm dNTPs, 1× buffer, 5% Me2SO, and 1 unit of Hercules polymerase (Stratagene). Each amplification reaction consisted of a 5-min incubation at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, 1.5 min at 72 °C, and a final elongation step for 7 min at 72 °C. Primer sequences are listed in Table I. The modified DNA was further amplified by nested amplification, DNA fragments were gel-purified with a SephaglasTM Bandprep kit (Amersham Biosciences) and cloned into pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Approximately 10 clones were sequenced per cell line. 5-AzaCdr and TSA Treatment—DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-azaCdr, was added to cells at final concentrations from 0.2 to 15 μm for 72 h. Deacetylase inhibitor, TSA (100 ng/ml), was added for 24 h alone or at the end of the 5-azaCdr treatment, where indicated. Subsequently, cells were used for RNA isolation using the Total RNA Isolation system (Promega), and 3 μg of total RNA was converted to cDNA using the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative Real-time PCR—Real-time PCR was performed with the LightCycler instrument (Roche Applied Science) using a ready-to-use one-step QuantiTectTM SYBR® Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Reactions were set up in 15 μl of final volume containing 2 μl of sample cDNA or standards, 0.5 μm primers, and 7.5 μl of 2× RT-PCR master mix. The amplification program for AIRE included an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 55 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 25 s, and extension at 72 °C for 20 s. SYBR® Green fluorescence was measured after each extension step. The specificity of amplification was subjected to melting curve analysis. The relative amount of the AIRE transcript was normalized to the amount of human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) transcript in each cDNA. The PCR conditions for GAPDH differed in that the annealing temperature was 58 °C and amplification consisted of 45 cycles. Cloned AIRE and GAPDH cDNAs were used as standards for quantification. Primer sequences to amplify the AIRE or GAPDH were as follows: AIRE-F, CCCTACTGTGTGTGGGTCCT; AIRE-R, ACGTCTCCTGAGCAGGATCT; GAPDH-F, CTGAGCTAGACGGGAAGCTC; and GAPDH-R, TCTGAGTGTGGCAGGGACT. Each of the PCR assays was run in triplicate, and the AIRE and GAPDH copy numbers were estimated from the threshold amplification cycle numbers using software supplied with the LightCycler thermal cycler. AIRE Proximal Promoter Contains Several Positive Regulatory Elements—We first isolated the human AIRE gene 5′-flanking region using PCR amplification of genomic DNA. The nucleotide sequence of the clone was found to be 100% identical with the genomic sequence in GenBankTM (accession number AB006684). The transcription initiation site, 128 bp upstream of the ATG codon, determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends method, has been described earlier (1Nagamine K. Peterson P. Scott H.S. Kudoh J. Minoshima S. Heino M. Krohn K.J. Lalioti M.D. Mullis P.E. Antonarakis S.E. Kawasaki K. Asakawa S. Ito F. Shimizu N. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the activity of the AIRE promoter, the fragment was subsequently cloned in front of a luciferase reporter gene and transfected transiently into COS-7 and TEC1A3 cell lines. The luciferase activity with the pAP1235 reporter construct was 146- and 44-fold in COS-7 and TEC1A3 cells, respectively, compared with a promoterless control plasmid pBL-KS (Fig. 1), indicating cis-acting elements in the AIRE promoter region. To further map the regions responsible for transcriptional control we made deletion constructs of the pAP1235 plasmid from the 5′-end of the promoter fragment. Luciferase assays with the deletion constructs pAP940, pAP583, and pAP350 gave comparably similar activities in COS-7 cells, whereas the pAP248 construct resulted in significant decrease of the activity to 19% in COS-7 cells when compared with the pAP1235 construct. An even further decrease of the luciferase activity (to ∼3%) was seen with the pAP190 deletion construct. Essentially similar results were obtained using the TEC1A3 cell line. As a conclusion of deletion construct analysis, the results showed that the sequence elements required for the minimal AIRE promoter activity reside within the first 350 bp upstream of the translation start site. Characterization of Factors Binding to the Promoter—Analysis of the 350-bp promoter region with the MatchTM program indicated the presence of high score potential binding sites for transcription factor complexes such as a GC box (at position -202 to -188), an inverted CCAAT box (position -212 to -200), and a binding site for transcription factor AP-1 (position -307 to -296). To characterize the transcription factors that interact with putative binding sites in the AIRE promoter region, EMSA, coupled with supershift assays, was performed. A shifted band appeared with the AP-1 site double-stranded oligonucleotide (-313 to -291) as a probe (Fig. 2A). The complex disappeared by the addition of a 100-molar excess amount of the unlabeled probe but was not affected by addition of the same amount of unrelated oligonucleotide to the reaction mix as a competitor. The mutated oligonucleotide probe from the AP-1 site was unable to form the complex, further underlining the specificity of the AP-1 site. To further characterize the complex, we performed a supershift assay by using antibodies raised against pan-Jun and pan-Fos proteins. The shifted band that appeared with the AIRE AP-1 site was supershifted by the addition of pan-Jun antibody, however, not by pan-Fos antibody (Fig. 2A). Similar DNA-protein complexes and supershift results were observed in both cell lines. As a control probe, we used a previously described AP-1 consensus site in complex formation and supershift analysis (Fig. 2A). The relevance of the CCAAT box in AIRE gene regulation was determined with probes coding for the CCAAT box sequence. DNA-binding reactions showed a shifted protein-DNA complex, which was fully abolished by addition of a 100-fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotide (Fig. 2B). Only a CCAAT box-specific oligonucleotide inhibited the formation of complex, because the protein-DNA complex was not competed away by a nonspecific competitor as a probe. In contrast, as an indication of protein binding specificity, mutations introduced into the AIRE CCAAT box consensus sequence abolished protein-DNA complex formation. To identify whether the protein within the specific protein-DNA complex was in fact NF-Y, supershift assays were performed with antibodies against A and B subunits of the NF-Y transcription complex. Both anti-NF-YA and anti-NF-YB antibodies were able to supershift the protein-DNA complexes, resembling the supershifted complex obtained with the CCAAT consensus sequence (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the importance of the GC box in the AIRE promoter was tested. The shifted complex obtained with the AIRE Sp1 probe was similar to the complex obtained with a control consensus Sp1 element (Fig. 2C). The complex disappeared with the addition of the unlabeled competitor but was not influenced by excess amount of unrelated oligonucleotide. The mutated AIRE Sp1 oligonucleotide used as probe resulted in no complex formation. The identity of the complex was further confirmed using an antibody specific for the Sp1 transcription factor. The Sp1 antibody was able to specifically interfere with the formation of the protein complex with the AIRE promoter element as well as with the consensus Sp1 element in supershift assays. Taken together, these results indicated that the AIRE promoter contains at least three specific regulatory elements, which form protein-DNA complexes with AP-1, NF-Y, and Sp1 transcription family members. Functional Analysis of TATA Box, AP-1, NF-Y, and Sp1 Regulatory Elements—In addition to the AP-1, NF-Y, and Sp1 regulatory elements, the AIRE promoter contains a TATA box located at the position 33 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. To study the functional significance of the TATA box and transcriptional complexes in the AIRE promoter, mutations were introduced into the pAP1235 luciferase reporter construct using site-directed oligonucleotide mutagenesis and transfected into the COS-7 and TEC1A3 cell lines (Fig. 3). The mutations introduced into the TATA box decreased AIRE promoter activity to 48% in COS-7 and to 69% in TEC1A3 cells, respectively. Mutations in the CCAAT box reduced the promoter activity to 44% in COS-7 cells, compared with 78% in TEC1A3 cells. Nucleotide substitutions within the GC box resulted in 75% activity in COS-7 and 52% in TEC1A3 cells compared with the full-length pAP1235 construct. Similarly, mutations in the AP-1 binding site decreased the promoter activity to 18% in COS-7 and to 35% in TEC1A3 cells. Thus, the results of these experiments showed that the TATA box, the AP-1 binding site, the inverted CCAAT box, and the GC box are functional. Moreover, the factors binding to these sites are essential for the AIRE gene regulation. AIRE Promoter Contains CpG Island and the Activity Is Blocked by in Vitro Methylation—We noted that the region surrounding the AIRE proximal promoter is GC-rich. The CpG dinucleotide distribution within the 1.2-kb genomic fragment was statistically analyzed as described by the method of Gardiner-Garden and Frommer (12Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol.

Correspondingly, a 390-bp CpG island was located at the AIRE promoter region, starting from about 300 bp upstream of the translational start site and encompassing the first exon (Fig. 4A). The effect of in vitro methylation on the promoter of the AIRE gene was tested in a transient expression assay using the pAP1235 promoter construct. After methylation with SssI methylase, which methylates cytosines residues within CpG dinucleotide, the methylated and unmethylated reporter constructs were transfected into TEC1A3 cells and assayed for expression. As a result in vitro methylation completely suppressed AIRE promoter activity compared with the unmethylated promoter construct (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained with experiments using the COS-7 cell line (data not shown). AIRE Promoter Is Less Methylated in the Thymic Epithelial Cell Line—The methylation status of CpG sites in the AIRE promoter region was first studied in TEC1A3 and THP-1 cell line genomic DNA using the methyl-sensitive restriction enzyme SmaI inside of a methylation-insensitive SacI fragment spanning the AIRE promoter. Subsequent hybridization with the AIRE promoter-specific probe revealed uncleaved SacI fragments, suggesting methylated status of the SmaI sites (data not shown). The DNA from HeLa, TEC1A3, and from two monocyte cell lines, THP-1 and U937, was further analyzed by bisulfite genomic sequencing. Genomic DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite under conditions where cytosines are converted to uracils, while methylated cytosines remain unmodified. The promoter region contained 47 CpG sites, covering a 390-bp fragment of the AIRE promoter. All tested CpG sites showed a heavy methylation pattern in monocytic cell lines (THP-1 and U937 cells, Fig. 5). Results obtained from HeLa cells were consistent with the res"

The rate of association, kon, for binding to the 1,2-d(GpG) adduct was 3.1 × 104m-1 s-1 and the specificity of binding was essentially dependent on koff.

Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 2630-2632PubMed Google Scholar). In the reaction between DNA and cisplatin, different types of bifunctional adducts are formed that are thought to be the key toxic lesions (2Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar, 3Kartalou M. Essigmann J.M. Mutat. Res. 2001; 478: 23-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 4Brabec V. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 1-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these adducts are responsible for a variety of cellular responses including replication and/or transcription inhibition, there is not yet a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms linking the formation of adducts and cisplatin-induced apoptosis (5Henkels K.M. Turchi J.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4488-4492PubMed Google Scholar, 6Eastman A. Lippert B. Cisplatin, Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug. V. H. C. A., Wiley-VCH, Zurich1999: 111-134Google Scholar). Cisplatin reacts preferentially with the N-7 atoms of purine residues in DNA. The major adducts (90%) are 1,2-intrastrand cross-links at d(GpG) and d(ApG) sites and the minor adducts correspond to 1,3-intrastrand cross-links at d(GpNpG) (N being a nucleotide residue) and interstrand cross-links formed at d(GpC/GpC) sites (7Eastman A.

Biochem. 1999; 77: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Once formed, cisplatin lesions such as the major 1,2-intrastrand cross-links can undergo replication bypass in cells treated with cisplatin (11Gibbons G. Kaufman W. Chaney S. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 2253-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Mamenta E.L. Poma E.E. Kaufman W. Delmastro D.A. Grady H.L. Chaney S.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3500-3505PubMed Google Scholar). Because these lesions are often miscoding, they give rise to another form of lesion that is called a compound lesion (13Mu D. Tursun M. Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), namely a lesion in one strand and a mismatch in the other. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the pattern of cisplatin mutagenesis suggests that the major 1,2-intrastrand cross-links give rise to an array of compound lesions of which the majority are those produced when an adenine is misincorporated opposite the adducts (14Yarema K.J.

For instance, misincorporation of a guanine by yeast polymerase ζ and misinsertion of a thymine by human polymerases η and β can occur opposite the 3′ adducted guanine (18Vaisman A. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4575-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 19Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol.

Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, studies showed that the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway contributes to the cytotoxicity elicited by cisplatin. In eukaryotes, MMR has been involved as an upstream component of a cisplatin-induced apoptotic pathway mediated by the tumor suppressor p73 or by the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (21Gong J.G.

Importantly, a relationship between the loss of a functional MMR pathway and cellular resistance to cisplatin cytotoxicity has been established in vitro and in vivo (23Drummond J.T. Anthoney A.

As cisplatin resistance is a major reason for treatment failure, it is therefore of great interest to understand how MMR-dependent molecular mechanisms participate in the modulation of cellular sensitivity to the drug. Several models have been proposed to explain the possible biochemical link between the MMR pathway and cisplatin cytotoxicity (reviewed in Refs. 26Fink D. Aebi S. Howell S. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar, 27Brown R. Kelland L.R. Farrell N. Platinum-based Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 115-148Google Scholar, 28Fishel R.

An important molecular determinant of such mechanisms was the identification of MMR proteins implicated in cisplatin cytotoxicity. Early experiments in Escherichia coli have shown that loss of MMR activity because of mutations in mutS or mutL was correlated with cisplatin resistance (30Fram R.J. Cusick P.S. Wilson J.M. Marinus M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 28: 51-55PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, mismatch repair defects because of loss of either human MSH2 or MSH6 subunits of hMutSα or the human MLH1 or PMS2 subunits of the hMutLα complex result in cisplatin resistance (23Drummond J.T. Anthoney A. Brown R. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19645-19648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 24Vaisman A. Varchenko M. Umar A. Kunkel T.A. Risinger J.I.

Thus MutS or MutL and their respective eukaryotic counterparts hMutSα or hMutLα are MMR proteins implicated in cisplatin cytotoxicity. Because the primary role of MutS and hMutSα appears to be recognition of mispaired bases and small base insertion mismatches (31Drummond J.T. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 32Acharya S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Kane M. Guerette S. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R. Fishel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1996; 6: 1181-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and as recognition of cisplatin-damage DNA is a necessary step in all proposed models, the first mechanistically important question concerns both the capability of MMR proteins to sense cisplatin-damaged DNA and the identification of the cisplatin lesions specifically recognized. A quantitative study reported that hMutSα displayed weak affinity for 1,2-d(GpG) cisplatin intrastrand cross-links (34Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Murchie A.I.H. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lilley D.M.J. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6443-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) but in contrast a qualitative study reported that this protein exhibits a strong preference for cisplatin compound lesions formed when a thymine is misincorporated opposite the major cisplatin adduct (35Yamada M. O'Regan E. Brown R. Karran P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This protein was also found to have a reduced affinity for a G/T mismatch in the context of a 1,2-d(GpG) adduct (13Mu D. Tursun M. Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) suggesting that compound lesions were not involved in MMR activity (36Marra G. Schär P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). hMSH2 alone also displayed weak affinity for the major intrastrand cross-link (37Mello J.A. Acharya S. Fishel R. Essigmann J.M. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 579-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). E. coli MutS was shown to recognize DNA globally modified by cisplatin (38Zdraveski Z.Z. Mello J.A. Farinelli C.K. Essigmann J.M. Marinus M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1255-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) but the precise nature of the bound adducts is not yet known. Therefore, a sensitive assay is needed to gain insight into the nature of the suspected cytotoxic lesions recognized by MMR binding activities. In particular, no extensive interaction study has been carried out with cisplatin compound lesions, defined here as a cisplatin lesion in one strand and a mismatch in the other. In the present study, we investigated the binding properties of E. coli MutS protein with various platinated DNA substrates containing a single centrally located cisplatin adduct to define the precise nature of the bound adducts. Experimental conditions were used in which sensitivity was high because of the absence of carrier DNA and to low nonspecific background binding. Within the sequence context studied here, the 1,2-d(GpG) adduct is the only bifunctional cisplatin lesion that is recognized albeit with a very low relative affinity. In contrast, MutS recognized with higher specificity an extended array of cisplatin compound lesions that are likely to be formed in vivo based on cisplatin mutation spectra. Surface plasmon resonance was employed for the first time to study MutS binding kinetics to several platinated DNA substrates; the weak binding of MutS to the 1,2-d(GpG) intrastrand cross-link is essentially dependent on a fast rate of dissociation. Taken together, our interaction data with MutS and different platinated DNA substrates suggest that cisplatin compound lesions formed during misincorporation of a base opposite either adducted base of both 1,2-intrastrand cross-links are the most probable critical lesions for MMR-mediated cisplatin cytotoxicity. Materials—Single-stranded 24-mer oligonucleotides, biotinylated oligonucleotides, and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from New England Biolabs. Untagged MutS was obtained from IntegraGen (Evry, France). Solutions of 40% acrylamide and 2% bisacrylamide were from Bio-Rad. Cisplatin was from Sigma. Surfactant P20 and streptavidin-coated SA sensor chips were purchased from BIAcore AB (Uppsala, Sweden). Protein Purification—Hexameric histidine-tagged MutS protein was prepared as previously described (39Drotschmann K. Aronshtam A. Fritz H.-J. Marinus M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The host strain was BL21 (λDE3) (Novagen) and the expression vector pMQ382 was kindly provided by Dr. M. G. Marinus. The strain transformed with pMQ382 was grown at 37 °C with shaking to an A600 of 0.6. The culture was then shifted to 25 °C and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 50 μm for 3 h. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in a sonication buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), frozen at -20 °C, and then sonicated. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The lysate obtained after centrifugation of the extract was mixed with a nickel affinity resin (Qiagen) and MutS was batch-eluted with elution buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. After overnight dialysis MutS was stored at -80 °C in a buffer containing 350 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol. The concentration of MutS protein was determined using the Bradford reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard and the purity was estimated as >95% using Coomassie staining of a sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel. The concentration was 1.5–2 mg/ml. Preparation of the glutathione S-transferase-MutY fusion protein was carried out as previously described (41Zhang Q.-M. Ishikawa N. Nakahara T. Yonei S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4669-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The host strain was BL21 (λDE3) and the expression vector pGEX-MutY was kindly provided by Dr. S. Yonei. The strain transformed with pGEX-MutY was grown at 25 °C with shaking to an A600 of 0.6. Expression of the glutathione S-transferase-MutY fusion protein was induced by the addition of 50 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and growth was continued overnight at 25 °C. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture, frozen at -20 °C, and then sonicated. After centrifugation the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. The bound protein was eluted with 15 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. After dialysis, the glutathione S-transferase-MutY fusion protein was cleaved in phosphate-buffered saline by thrombin protease by overnight incubation at 4 °C and the final concentration was 0.5 mg/ml. Platination and DNA Purification—The sequences of the oligonucleotides are shown in Fig. 1. Single-stranded oligonucleotides including those with a 3′-biotin label were purified on a 24% denaturating polyacrylamide gel. The preparation and purification of oligonucleotides containing single 1,2-d(GpG), d(ApG), or d(GpCpG) cisplatin intrastrand cross-links and the synthesis of the cisplatin interstrand cross-link was as described (42Malinge J.-M. Schwartz A. Leng M. Travers A. Buckle M. DNA-Protein Interactions. Oxford University Press Inc., New York2000: 25-35Google Scholar). The single-stranded purine-rich oligonucleotide 5′-AGGAGTAGAGATCGAGAGAGTAAG-3′ was 5′-end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Radiolabeled heteroduplexes GG/CT and G*G*/CT were prepared by mixing the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide with a 1.5 molar excess of complementary purine-rich oligonucleotide containing a GG platination site without or with a cisplatin residue in annealing buffer (60 mm KCl, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA), heating at 75 °C for 5 min and slowly cooling at 4 °C. Radiolabeled duplexes GG/CT and G*G*/CT were then purified on non-denaturating 10% polyacrylamide gels. Unlabeled duplexes for competition experiments were annealed by combining equimolar amounts of the two complementary strands at concentrations of 1–3.5 μm in annealing buffer at 75 °C followed by cooling to 4 °C. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Competition Assays—MutS (21 nm) was incubated in binding buffer (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 80 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, and 2% glycerol) with mixtures of 32P-labeled duplex GG/CT (2 nm) and particular unlabeled duplex competitors at varying concentrations as indicated in 20 μl. Reactions were allowed to reach equilibrium by incubation at 4 °C for 20 min. Gel loading buffer was added, and the reaction mixture was loaded on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide (w/w); 45 mm Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). Gels were electrophoresed for 1 h at 4 °C at 13 V/cm, dried, and exposed to an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager screen overnight. The fraction bound (radioactivity of the bound complex/total radioactivity) was determined by ImageQuant 5.1 software (Amersham Biosciences). Data analysis were carried out as described (43Wang H. Lawrence C.W. Li G.M. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16894-16900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We determined the concentration of various competitors necessary to decrease by 2-fold the amount of DNA shifted in the absence of competitor by linear regression of plots of the fraction of DNA bound in the absence of competitor divided by the fraction of DNA bound in the presence of competitor as a function of the competitor concentration. Direct Binding Experiments—Varying concentrations of MutS (0 to 100 nm) were used to titrate 32P-labeled duplex GG/CT or G*G*/CT (2 nm) in binding conditions as described above with the exception that no competitor DNA was present. The subsequent steps were the same as described under “Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Competition Assay.” The fraction bound was calculated and plotted as a function of the protein concentration. Data were least-squares fitted to an equation for a simple two-state binding process (44Giraud-Panis M.-J. Lilley D.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33148-33155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using Origin 6.0 software (Microcal, Northampton, MA). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Measurements—SPR measurements were performed on a BIAcore 2000 at 15 °C using a streptavidincoated chip and duplex DNA containing a 3′-biotin on the nonadducted purine-rich strand. 24-Mer oligonucleotides used for SPR were the same as those presented in Fig. 1 with the exception that the purine-rich strand oligonucleotides have a 3′-biotin. Various biotinylated duplexes were prepared by mixing biotinylated purine-rich strand with a 3-fold molar excess of pyrimidine-rich strand in annealing buffer at 75 °C followed by cooling to 4 °C. Platinated and unplatinated biotinylated DNA duplexes were bound to the streptavidin-coated SA sensor chip by injecting 10 μl of 750 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, and 1.7 μm biotinylated duplexes GG/CC, G*G*/CC, GG/CT, G*G*/CT, GG/TC, or G*G*/TC. MutS protein was injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min in running buffer (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.0005% Tween 20, and 2% glycerol). Two washes of 10 μl of running buffer containing 0.04% SDS were used to regenerate the surface after each injection of MutS. Binding to each duplex was assayed at five different concentrations of MutS (0–1000 μm). To obtain kinetic parameters, late association phases and early dissociation phases of the resulting sensorgrams were fit to the Langmuir binding model using BIAevaluation software (version 2.0). The ratio of bound MutS per duplex DNA substrate was deduced from the stoichiometry formula (MutS response × DNA Mr)/(DNA response × MutS Mr), where MutS response is the maximal response (in RU) obtained at the plateau level, DNA response (in RU) corresponds to the plateau value for a DNA substrate, and DNA and MutS Mr are molecular weights of the DNA substrate and MutS, respectively. To check the chemical stability of bound platinum residue within biotinylated duplexes, the platinated pyrimidine-rich strand was 5′-32P-end labeled followed by hybridization with matched or mismatched complementary biotinylated strand. Labeled duplexes were then incubated in 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA at 25 °C for 24 h and loaded on a 24% denaturating polyacrylamide gel. After migration no product corresponding to unplatinated pyrimidine-rich strand was detected indicating that the platinum residue was not displaced from the strand. MutY Adenine Glycosylase Assay—Radiolabeled double-stranded 24-mer oligonucleotides GG/CC, GG/AC, and G*G*/AC were prepared and purified as described above (with the purine-rich strand 5′-32P-end-labeled). Reactions were as previously described with minor modifications (41Zhang Q.-M. Ishikawa N. Nakahara T. Yonei S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4669-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, duplexes (40 fmol) were incubated with MutY (130 ng) at room temperature in 10 μl of reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm EDTA followed by the addition of 2 μl of 2.5 m NaOH and heating at 95 °C for 5 min at the times indicated. The denaturated samples were electrophoresed on a 24% denaturating polyacrylamide gel followed by quantification by phosphorimaging. Relative Binding Affinities of MutS for Cisplatin Bifunctional Adducts within the Context of Homoduplex DNA—We were first interested in determining whether bifunctional adducts of cisplatin could be recognized by the bacterial MutS within the context of homoduplex DNA. For this purpose we designed 24-mer oligonucleotide duplexes (Fig. 1) containing each of the four cisplatin bifunctional adducts considered as critical lesions for drug cytotoxicity: the 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) and d(ApG) cross-links, the 1,3-d(GpCpG) intrastrand cross-link, and the interstrand cross-link formed at a d(GC/GC) site. To determine the relative affinities of purified E. coli MutS for the different platinated duplexes, we performed competition experiments using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. We compared the abilities of the various platinated unlabeled 24-mer duplexes to compete with 32P-labeled G/T containing duplex GG/CT. In agreement with previous data (45Blackwell L.J. Bjornson K.P. Dwayne J.A. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34339-34347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the dissociation constant (Kd) for MutS with the duplex GG/CT was found to be 19 ± 3 nm as determined by direct titration experiments (data not shown). We confirmed that tagged MutS protein yielded the same results as untagged protein for all the binding experiments presented in this study. Fig. 2A shows typical competition experiments for which the 32P-labeled duplex GG/CT was mixed with different amounts of the unlabeled duplex competitors GG/CT, GG/CC, and G*G*/CC that contained the major 1,2-intrastrand cisplatin cross-link. As expected, addition of unlabeled duplex GG/CT competes away the binding of MutS to the probe as judged by the decrease of the bound DNA (migrating with reduced electrophoretic mobility). Duplexes GG/CC and G*G*/CC inhibit weakly the binding of MutS to the probe, with the platinated duplex showing slightly greater inhibition. Data from competition experiments were plotted as the fractional binding of labeled duplex GG/CT in the absence of competitor relative to binding at various competitor concentrations as a function of competitor DNA concentrations as previously reported (43Wang H. Lawrence C.W. Li G.M. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16894-16900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). The concentration of competitor duplexes necessary to reduce GG/CT binding by 50% was used to determine the specificity for various competitors relative to homoduplex DNA substrates. MutS was found to recognize specifically the homoduplex G*G*/CC containing a cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) adduct. However, the 1,2-d(GpG) intrastrand cross-link is recognized with only a 1.5-fold specificity (Table I), whereas the duplex GG/CT containing a natural G/T mismatch is bound by MutS with a 47-fold higher preference (Table II). The adduct recognition appears to be sequence-independent as MutS binding was the same when the nature of the base pairs flanking the platination site was changed (CGGC or TGGT as central sequence for the purine-rich strand) or when the entire sequence was changed by using oligonucleotides previously studied in binding experiments with hMutSα (34Duckett D.R.

https://openalex.org/W1966280378,"Pref-1 is a highly glycosylated Delta-like transmembrane protein containing six epidermal growth factor-like repeats in the extracellular domain. Pref-1 is abundantly expressed in preadipocytes, but expression is down-regulated during adipocyte differentiation. Forced expression of Pref-1 in 3T3-L1 cells was reported to inhibit adipocyte differentiation. Here we show that efficient and regulated processing of Pref-1 occurs in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes releasing most of the extracellular domain as a 50-kDa heterogeneous protein, previously isolated and characterized as FA1. Unexpectedly, we found that forced expression of the soluble form, FA1, or full-length Pref-1 did not inhibit adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells when differentiation was induced by standard treatment with methylisobutylxanthine, dexamethasone, and high concentrations of insulin. However, forced expression of either form of Pref-1/FA1 in 3T3-L1 or 3T3-F442A cells inhibited adipocyte differentiation when insulin or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was omitted from the differentiation mixture. We demonstrate that the level of the mature form of the IGF-1 receptor is reduced and that IGF-1-dependent activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) is compromised in preadipocytes with forced expression of Pref-1. This is accompanied by suppression of clonal expansion and terminal differentiation. Accordingly, supplementation with insulin or IGF-1 rescued p42/p44 MAPK activation, clonal expansion, and adipocyte differentiation in a dose-dependent manner.

Adipocyte differentiation is a complex process that involves dramatic changes of cell morphology and gene expression (for review, see Refs. 1MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev.

In addition, growth hormone has been shown to inhibit differentiation of primary preadipocytes (6Hauner H. Rohrig K. Petruschke T. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 25: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), but it exerts a proadipogenic action on several preadipocyte cell lines, including 3T3-L1 (14Morikawa M. Nixon T. Green H. Cell. 1982; 29: 783-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 15Nixon B.T. Green H. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Doglio A. Dani C. Grimaldi P Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Pref-1 cDNA was cloned from a 3T3-L1 cDNA library in a screening for genes that were differentially expressed during adipocyte differentiation (17Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Pref-1 is abundantly expressed in preadipocytes, whereas expression in mature adipocyte is undetectable (17Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 cells, pref-1 expression has been demonstrated to be down-regulated by a change from growth in normal calf serum to growth in fetal calf serum, and an element in the pref-1 promoter involved in this down-regulation has been identified (18Smas C.M. Kachinskas D. Liu C.M. Xie X. Dircks L.K. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31751-31758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, the proadipogenic action of dexamethasone has been related to a dexamethasone-mediated acute down-regulation of pref-1 transcription (19Smas C.M. Chen L. Zhao L. Latasa M.-J. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12632-12641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Forced expression of Pref-1 was reported to inhibit adipogenesis, and accordingly, Pref-1 was suggested to play an important role in the maintenance of the preadipose state (17Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In accordance with this hypothesis, a reduction in the level of pref-1 expression in 3T3-L1 cells by expression of pref-1 antisense RNA decreased the requirements for dexamethasone to support adipocyte differentiation (19Smas C.M. Chen L. Zhao L. Latasa M.-J. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12632-12641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and a reduction of pref-1 expression in Balb/c 3T3 cells dramatically increased their ability to undergo adipose conversion in response to supraphysiological levels of insulin (20Bauer S.R. Ruiz-Hidalgo M.J. Rudikoff E.K. Goldstein J. Laborda J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5247-5255Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Garcés C. Ruiz-Hidalgo M.J. Bonvini E. Goldstein J. Laborda J. Differentiation. 1999; 64: 103-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the generation of Pref-1-null mice demonstrated that lack of Pref-1 expression is associated with obesity and that pref-1 in mice, as in humans, is a paternally expressed imprinted gene (22Moon Y.S. Smas C.M. Lee K. Villena J.A Kim K.-H. Yun E.J. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5585-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Pref-1 belongs to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein family, the members of which are characterized by the presence of EGF-like motifs in their extracellular domains. Members of the EGF-like protein family can function as soluble or transmembrane proteins that exert their effects through protein-protein interaction and play important roles in cellular growth and differentiation. One well-characterized subclass includes EGF and transforming growth factor-α. These proteins arise by ectodomain processing and release from transmembrane precursors and exert their action upon binding to the EGF receptor. Interestingly, processing and release are not prerequisites for biological activity (for review, see Ref. 23Massague J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). One of the best-characterized examples involving lateral protein-protein interaction of transmembrane proteins is provided by the Notch-Delta or Notch-Serrate/Jagged systems that play pivotal roles in cell fate determination during neurogenesis (24Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Recently, Notch-1 was also shown to be implicated in adipocyte differentiation (25Garcés C. Ruiz-Hidalgo M.J. de Mora J.F. Park C. Miele L. Goldstein J. Bonvini E. Porras A. Laborda J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29729-29734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The organization of the pref-1 gene and the structure of the individual EGF-like repeats strongly suggest that Pref-1 is most closely related to the Delta family (26Smas C.M. Green D. Sul H.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9257-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Apart from its function in adipocyte differentiation, Pref-1 has been shown to be involved in the interaction between stromal cells and hematopoietic cells, in which dlk expression in stromal cells is directly correlated with their capability to provide a microenvironment allowing co-cultured hematopoietic stem cells to give rise to highly proliferative myeloiderythroid progenitors (20Bauer S.R. Ruiz-Hidalgo M.J. Rudikoff E.K. Goldstein J. Laborda J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5247-5255Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Moore K.A. Pytowski B. Witte L. Hicklin D. Lemischka I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is a recent report describing a role for Pref-1 in thymocyte development (28Kaneta M. Osawa M. Osawa M. Sudo K. Nakauchi H. Farr A.G. Takahama Y. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a dimeric form of Pref-1 was shown to increase thymocyte cellularity in an HES-1-dependent manner even though Pref-1 is devoid of the DSL motif generally thought to be necessary for Delta-Notch-type interactions (20Bauer S.R. Ruiz-Hidalgo M.J. Rudikoff E.K. Goldstein J. Laborda J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5247-5255Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Prior to the cloning of pref-1, a soluble form of the human homolog of Pref-1, named fetal antigen 1 (FA1), was isolated from amniotic fluid (29Fay T. Jacob I. Teisner B. Poulsen O. Chapman M. Stabile I. Bohr H. Westergaard J.G. Crudzinskas S.G. Eur. J. Obstet. Gynecol. Repro. Biol. 1988; 29: 73-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 30Jensen C.H. Teisner B. Hojrup P. Rasmussen H. Madsen O.D. Nielsen B. Skjodt K. Human Reprod. 1993; 8: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Jensen C.H. Krogh T.N. Hojrup P. Clausen P.P. Skjodt K. Larsen L.-I. Enghild J.J. Teisner B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and subsequently, mouse FA1 was isolated from mouse amniotic fluid (32Bachmann E. Krogh T.N. Hojrup P. Skjodt K. Teisner B. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1996; 107: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison revealed that FA1, Pref-1, pG2 (a human adrenal specific mRNA) (33Helman L.J. Sack N. Plon S.E. Israel M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 685Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and dlk (delta-like protein) (34Laborda J. Sausville E.A. Hoffman T. Notario V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 6: 3817-3820Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) represent polymorphic variants of the same gene (30Jensen C.H. Teisner B. Hojrup P. Rasmussen H. Madsen O.D. Nielsen B. Skjodt K. Human Reprod. 1993; 8: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Lee Y.L. Lee H. Hoffman T. Laborda J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The presence of high levels of FA1 in amniotic fluid immediately suggested that Pref-1 might also function as a soluble molecule. Accordingly, it has been shown that a bacterially expressed GST-Pref-1 fusion protein could inhibit adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells in a dose-dependent manner (36Smas C.M. Chen L. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and purified human FA1 was reported to inhibit differentiation of primary rat preadipocytes (37Hansen L.H. Madsen B. Teisner B. Nielsen J.H. Billestrup N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was furthermore reported that conditioned medium from COS-7 or Balb/c cells transfected with pref-1 could prevent 3T3-L1 cells from undergoing adipocyte differentiation (21Garcés C. Ruiz-Hidalgo M.J. Bonvini E. Goldstein J. Laborda J. Differentiation. 1999; 64: 103-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Smas C.M. Chen L. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and recently it was reported that only the large soluble form of Pref-1 was able to inhibit adipocyte differentiation (38Mei B. Zhao L Chen L. Sul H.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that Pref-1 is processed and released from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, but this in fact has not been directly demonstrated. In this report, we show that mouse Pref-1 is released from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes as a 50-kDa heterogeneous protein that is indistinguishable from mouse FA1 purified from amniotic fluid. We show that processing is regulated in a growth/differentiation-dependent manner and that a significant fraction of the synthesized Pref-1 is processed and released from 3T3-L1 cells. We confirm previous findings that pref-1 expression is down-regulated during adipocyte differentiation and show that the ratio between membrane-bound and soluble Pref-1/FA1 is maintained during differentiation. Surprisingly, we found that forced expression of full-length Pref-1 or the soluble form of Pref-1/FA1 did not inhibit adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells using the standard MDI protocol that includes treatment with Mix, Dex, and supraphysiological concentrations of insulin for induction of differentiation. However, in the absence of insulin or IGF-1, forced Pref-1 expression inhibited adipocyte differentiation. These results suggested that IGF-1/IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling was compromised in the cells overexpressing Pref-1, thereby rendering the cells unresponsive to the low concentration of IGF-1 in the fetal calf serum. In keeping with this, we show that IGF-1 or insulin in a dose-dependent manner bypassed the inhibitory effect of Pref-1. Finally, we present evidence that forced expression of Pref-1 reduced the level of the mature form of the IGF-1R, inhibited clonal expansion, and severely curtailed IGF-1-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPKs. Plasmids and Cloning—The retroviral vector Akvbipe2 was generated by inserting retroviral sequences into the EcoRI/SalI site of pUC19. The retroviral sequences contain the long-terminal repeats and packaging sequence Ψ derived from retrovirus Akv-MLV (39Herr W. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 471-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the encephalomyocarditis virus IRES (internal ribosomal entry site) (40Morgan R.A. Couture L. Elroy-Stein O. Ragheb J. Moss B. Anderson W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) between the two long-terminal repeats. Mouse pref-1 cDNA was generated by RT-PCR from total RNA of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using Expand™ reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science). Different regions of rat pref-1 (41Carlsson C. Tornehave D. Lindberg K. Galante P. Billestrup N. Michelsen B. Larsen L.-I. Nielsen J.H. Endocrinol. 1997; 138: 3940-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and mouse pref-1 were generated by PCR and cloned into the polylinker site of Akvbipe2 to generate plasmids AkvrPrefFL, AkvrPrefSF, AkvrPrefET, AkvrPrefIC, AkvmPrefFL, AkvmPrefSF, AkvmPrefET, and AkvmPrefIC (Fig. 2A). The sequences of the plasmids were verified by sequencing. Transfection and Transduction—BOSC23 packaging cells (42Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar) were grown in 9-cm dishes in DMEM (Invitrogen, high glucose) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) until they reached 80% confluency and then transfected with 7.5 μg of Akvbipe2 or the Pref-1-expressing vectors using the 3β[N-(N′,N′-dimethylaminoethane)carbamoyl]-cholesterol procedure as described previously (43Gao X. Huang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Six hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium, and after another 48 h of incubation, the virus-containing medium was harvested and either frozen down at -80 °C or used immediately for transduction. Before transduction, the viral suspension was mixed with 1 volume of fresh DMEM and 6 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma). The 3T3-L1 cells were transduced at 50% confluency, and the following day, the cells were split 1:6 and replated under selection of 600 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). Seven days later, the selected clones were pooled and replated for differentiation experiments. Cell Culture and Differentiation—Following selection, the transduced 3T3-L1 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% calf serum (CS) (Sigma) and 400 μg/ml G418 (Sigma) until they reached confluency, at which time G418 was removed. At 2 days postconfluency (defined as day 0), the cells were induced to differentiate as described earlier (44MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Lin F.T. Chen S.S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19041-19047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1 μm dexamethasone (Dex, Sigma), 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (Mix, Aldrich). Insulin or IGF-1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added as indicated. Dex and Mix were maintained until day 2, and insulin/IGF-1 when added was maintained until day 4. At the time points indicated, media were collected, and the cells were either harvested for analysis of protein by Western blotting and ELISA, or stained with Oil Red O (Sigma). Non-transduced 3T3-L1 and 3T3-C2 cells were cultured and treated according to the standard MDI differentiation protocol (DMEM, 10% FCS, 1 μm Dex, 0.5 mm Mix, and 1 μg/ml insulin). 3T3-F442A cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% CS until confluency and then induced to differentiate by switching to DMEM containing 10% FCS, 10 nm insulin, and 2 nm T3. Medium was renewed every second day for both cell types. For the analysis of MAPK and Akt activation, the transduced 3T3-L1 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% CS until 2 days post confluency and then switched to differentiation medium (DMEM, 10% FCS, 1 μm Dex, and 0.5 mm Mix with or without 10 nm IGF-1) and cultured until the indicated time points when cell lysates were prepared for Western blotting. Purification of Mouse Pref-1/FA1—Pref-1/FA1 was purified from medium conditioned by 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or from murine amniotic fluid by immunospecific affinity chromatography as described previously (32Bachmann E. Krogh T.N. Hojrup P. Skjodt K. Teisner B. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1996; 107: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). ELISA—ELISA was performed as described (32Bachmann E. Krogh T.N. Hojrup P.

The plates were incubated overnight with test samples and calibrator (mouse amniotic fluid in 2-fold dilution series). Biotinylated affinity-purified rabbit anti-mFA1 was used as the detector antibody, and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, H2O2, and O-phenylenediamine were used to develop the reaction. Triglyceride Measurement—mPref-1-transduced 3T3-L1 cells were lysed in Tris-Cl buffer by sonication. The triglyceride content was measured by using the GPO-Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Sigma). Multiplex RT-PCR—RNA purification, reverse transcription, and multiplex RT-PCR were performed as previously described (45Hansen J.B. Petersen R.K. Larsen B.M. Bartkova J. Alsner J. Kristiansen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2386-2393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For PCR, 20 cycles were performed. The primer sets used were: Mouse TBP upstream: 5′-ACC CTT CAC CAA TGA CTC CTA TG; downstream: 5′-ATG ATG ACT GCA GCA AAT CGC. Mouse IGF-1R upstream: 5′-TCA GGC TTC ATC CGC AAC AG; downstream: 5′-CAA GGA GAC CAA GGC ATG AG. Western Blotting—Whole cell extracts and conditioned medium from 3T3-L1-vector, 3T3-L1-mPrefFL, and 3T3-L1-mPrefSF cells were subjected to Western blotting. For cell extracts, 100 μg of total protein was loaded; for conditioned medium, 10 μl was loaded. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-mouse FA1 and anti-rat FA1 antibody (32Bachmann E. Krogh T.N. Hojrup P. Skjodt K. Teisner B. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1996; 107: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), anti-mouse aP2 antibody (kindly provided by David A. Bernlohr), anti-mouse PPARγ2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7273), anti-IGF-1R β-subunit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-713-G), anti-TBP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-273), anti-MAPK antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, #9102 for total MAPK p42/p44 and #9106L for phosphorylated MAPK p42/p44), and anti-Akt antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, #9272 for total Akt and #9271L for phosphorylated Akt). Visualization was achieved by enhanced chemiluminescence. Bromodeoxyuridine Labeling—3T3-L1-vector, 3T3-L1-mPrefSF, and 3T3-L1-mPrefFL cells were grown to 2-day post confluency in DMEM plus 10% CS and then treated with differentiation medium containing DMEM, 10% FCS, 1 μm Dex, 0.5 mm Mix, and different concentrations of IGF-1 as indicated. The cells were labeled with BrdUrd between the period from 12 to 24 h after the start of the treatment, and BrdUrd incorporations were carried out using the 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine Labeling and Detection Kit I according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Regulation of Expression and Secretion of Pref-1 in 3T3-L1— When the membrane-bound variants, Pref-1A and Pref-1B, are expressed in COS-7 cells they are processed to produce a soluble 50-kDa fragment of the ectodomain encompassing all six EGF-like repeats (36Smas C.M. Chen L. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and high levels of a similarly processed soluble form named FA1 is present in amniotic fluid and fetal serum (29Fay T. Jacob I. Teisner B. Poulsen O. Chapman M. Stabile I. Bohr H. Westergaard J.G. Crudzinskas S.G. Eur. J. Obstet. Gynecol. Repro. Biol. 1988; 29: 73-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 30Jensen C.H. Teisner B. Hojrup P. Rasmussen H. Madsen O.D. Nielsen B. Skjodt K. Human Reprod. 1993; 8: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 32Bachmann E. Krogh T.N. Hojrup P. Skjodt K. Teisner B. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1996; 107: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that a similar processing occurs in preadipocytes, although this has not been demonstrated. In fact, it was reported that soluble Pref-1/FA1 could not be detected in the medium conditioned by rat primary preadipocytes treated with growth hormone even though expression of pref-1 mRNA was enhanced by the hormone (37Hansen L.H. Madsen B. Teisner B. Nielsen J.H. Billestrup N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using fused rocket immunoelectrophoresis we found that conditioned medium from the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes contained a protein that immunologically was indistinguishable from FA1 purified from amniotic fluid (results not shown). Western blotting revealed that Pref-1/FA1 present in the conditioned medium co-migrated with purified mouse FA1, and addition of brefeldin prevented as expected accumulation of Pref-1 in the conditioned medium (results not shown). To examine the correlation between Pref-1 synthesis and Pref-1/FA1 release during differentiation, 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated according to the standard MDI protocol or treated with FCS only as control. Each day during preconfluent growth and during the differentiation period, conditioned medium was isolated and cell lysates were prepared for quantification of Pref-1/FA1 by ELISA (Fig. 1). This analysis first of all showed that the amount of Pref-1/FA1 released to the medium from 3T3-L1 cells was substantial reaching levels approaching 800 ng/ml at confluency. It is also evident that a significant fraction of the synthesized Pref-1 must be processed, although the lack of detailed knowledge of turnover rates of membrane-bound versus released Pref-1/FA1 prevents precise stoichiometric estimates. The levels of Pref-1/FA1 in cell lysates increased as cells became confluent, and they further increased when the cells were maintained in the confluent state for 2 days prior to treatment with adipogenic inducers. Interestingly, an increase in the level of released Pref-1/FA1 was observed between day 1 and day 2 of confluency (Fig. 1, a and b, from day -1 to day 0) suggesting a growth-dependent alteration in processing activity. Addition of FCS to confluent cells led to a marked decrease in the level of released Pref-1/FA1, whereas the level of Pref-1/FA1 in the cell lysates only declined modestly (Fig. 1, a and c). Following MDI treatment, the level of Pref-1 in the conditioned medium dropped rapidly. This was paralleled by a similar, although more gradual, decline in the level of Pref-1 in the lysates (Fig. 1, b and d). After 6 days of differentiation, ∼80% of the 3T3-L1 cells had differentiated as judged by the accumulation of cellular lipid (results not shown), and by then the level of Pref-1/FA1 in the medium and lysate had fallen to ∼13 and 20%, respectively, of the maximal levels observed prior to treatment with adipogenic inducers. It should be noted that our finding, that total Pref-1 in the lysate and Pref-1/FA1 in the medium decline in concert, does not support the suggestion of Garcés et al. (21Garcés C. Ruiz-Hidalgo M.J. Bonvini E. Goldstein J. Laborda J. Differentiation. 1999; 64: 103-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that differential expression of pref-1 splice variants, and hence processing plays an important role in the initiation of adipocyte differentiation. Rather, our results support the findings of Smas et al. (19Smas C.M. Chen L. Zhao L. Latasa M.-J. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12632-12641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) indicating co-regulated expression of all pref-1 splice variants. It has been reported that the differentiation-defective 3T3-C2 exhibited a 3-fold increase in Pref-1 expression compared with 3T3-L1 cells, and it was hypothesized that this increased level of Pref-1 expression is causally related to the inability of 3T3-C2 cells to undergo adipocyte differentiation (17Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Using ELISA for determination of Pref-1/FA1 in medium conditioned by 3T3-C2 cells and in lysates, we were unable to confirm this observation. On the contrary, the maximal levels of Pref-1/FA1 in medium conditioned by confluent 3T3-C2 and in lysates were only ∼30% of those determined for 3T3-L1 cel"
https://openalex.org/W2006898756,"The major protein component at the surface of merozoites, the infectious form of blood stage malaria parasites, is the merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) complex. In the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, this complex is generated by proteolytic cleavage of a 190-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored precursor into four major fragments, which remain non-covalently associated. Here, we describe the in vitro reconstitution of the MSP-1 complex of P. falciparum strain 3D7 from its heterologously produced subunits. We provide evidence for the arrangement of the subunits within the complex and show how they interact with each other. Our data indicate that the conformation assumed by the reassembled complex as well as by the heterologously produced 190-kDa precursor corresponds to the native one. Based on these results we propose a first structural model for the MSP-1 complex. Together with access to faithfully produced material, this information will advance further structure-function studies of MSP-1 that plays an essential role during invasion of erythrocytes by the parasite and that is considered a promising candidate for a malaria vaccine.

Together with access to faithfully produced material, this information will advance further structure-function studies of MSP-1 that plays an essential role during invasion of erythrocytes by the parasite and that is considered a promising candidate for a malaria vaccine. Merozoites, the erythrocyte invading form of malaria parasites, uniformly expose at their surface a major protein complex, the merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1). 1The abbreviations used are: MSP-1, merozoite surface protein 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; mAb, monoclonal antibody; BSA, bovine serum albumin. In Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite causing the most severe form of malaria in humans, MSP-1 is synthesized as an approximately 190-kDa precursor protein, which is deposited at the surface of the developing merozoite via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (1Holder A.A. Freeman R.R. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In late schizogony, merozoites undergo maturation during which MSP-1 is proteolytically cleaved into four major fragments (2McBride J.S. Heidrich H.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 23: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), which, however, remain non-covalently associated at the surface of the parasite. At the time of erythrocyte invasion, a second proteolytic cleavage separates the approximately 10-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored C terminus of MSP-1, called p19, from the rest of the complex, and only the membrane-bound portion is transferred into the newly infected erythrocyte while the remaining complex is shed from the surface of the parasite (3Blackman M.J. Whittle H. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 49: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 4Blackman M.J. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence demonstrate that MSP-1 plays an essential role in the life cycle of the parasite and that it is involved in the erythrocyte invasion process. Thus, attempts to knock out the msp-1 gene in P. falciparum via homologous recombination failed, whereas the same approach allows to replace the functionally conserved C-terminal end of the molecule by a sequence of a distantly related Plasmodium species (5O'Donnell R.A. Saul A. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Moreover, several monoclonal antibodies directed to the C-terminal p19 fragment inhibit efficiently erythrocyte invasion in vitro (6Blackman M.J. Heidrich H.G. Donachie S. McBride J.S. Holder A.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). These antibodies also prevent the secondary cleavage of MSP-1 during invasion (7Blackman M.J. Scott-Finnigan T.J. Shai S. Holder A.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). At least, this latter proteolytic step appears, therefore, to be an essential prerequisite for the infection of erythrocytes. Interestingly, antibodies were identified that can block the effect of invasion inhibiting antibodies in vitro (8Guevara Patino J.A. Holder A.A. McBride J.S. Blackman M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1689-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear to which extent these blocking antibodies play a role in vivo. MSP-1 is also targeted by the human immune response and particularly the C-terminal region has been shown to elicit protective humoral immunity in various rodent systems but also in monkey models (for review see Ref. 9Good M.F. Kaslow D.C. Miller L.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 57-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). MSP-1, particularly its C-terminal portion, is therefore considered a promising candidate for the development of a malaria vaccine. Despite all this information, we know little about mechanistic aspects of MSP-1 function and about its structure. Analysis of the primary sequence of MSP-1 from different P. falciparum isolates has revealed that several regions in the molecule are highly conserved, whereas major portions are dimorphic belonging to either the K1 or MAD20 prototype. In addition, one notices two small oligomorphic blocks (10Miller L.H. Roberts T. Shahabuddin M. McCutchan T.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 11Tanabe K. Mackay M. Goman M. Scaife J.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The most thoroughly investigated portion of MSP-1 is the C-terminal p19 fragment generated during the secondary proteolytic cleavage. Its sequence is highly conserved among P. falciparum isolates, but it also exhibits a remarkable structural and functional conservation across species of malaria parasites (5O'Donnell R.A. Saul A. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It is folded into two epidermal growth factor-like domains stabilized by six disulfide bonds, and for p19 of P. falciparum the three-dimensional structure has been solved by NMR spectroscopy (12Morgan W.D. Birdsall B. Frenkiel T.A. Gradwell M.G. Burghaus P.A. Syed S.E. Uthaipibull C. Holder A.A. Feeney J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) while the respective structure of p19 from Plasmodium cynomolgi was elucidated by x-ray analysis (13Chitarra V. Holm I. Bentley G.A. Petres S. Longacre S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 457-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Little structural or functional information is available for the residual around 95% of MSP-1, although it is well documented that it interacts with other proteins at the surface of the parasite such as MSP-636 (14Trucco C. Fernandez-Reyes D. Howell S. Stafford W.H. Scott-Finnigan T.J. Grainger M. Ogun S.A. Taylor W.R. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and MSP-722 (15Pachebat J.A. Ling I.T. Grainger M. Trucco C. Howell S. Fernandez-Reyes D. Gunaratne R. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Stafford W.H. Gunder B. Harris A. Heidrich H.G. Holder A.A. Blackman M.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been suggested that merozoites contact the erythrocyte surface via MSP-1 (17Nikodem D. Davidson E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the past, more thorough biochemical studies of MSP-1 of P. falciparum were hampered by experimental difficulties encountered when attempting to heterologously produce this complex protein. For example, the high AT content of 76–78% of the respective parasite genes prevented their stable cloning and, thus, their heterologous expression in good yields, a problem solved only recently by synthetic genes encoding the proteins in different codon compositions (18Pan W. Ravot E. Tolle R. Frank R. Mosbach R. Turbachova I. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1094-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19.Tuerbachova, I. (2000) Synthese des Hauptoberflaechenproteins MSP-1 aus Plasmodium falciparum in Toxoplasma gondii: Untersuchungen zur Struktur und Funktion. Ph.D. thesis, Universitaet HeidelbergGoogle Scholar). Moreover, as MSP-1 is not glycosylated in the parasite despite numerous potential glycosylation sites (20Berhe S.G.P. Kedees M.H. Holder A.A. Schwarz R.T. Exp. Parasitol. 2000; 3: 194-197Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), a prokaryotic expression system would be of advantage. Recovering, however, a 190-kDa protein containing numerous disulfide bonds in its proper conformation, e.g. from Escherichia coli, generally poses an experimental challenge. Here, we describe experiments aimed at the elucidation of the overall structure of the MSP-1 complex of P. falciparum strain 3D7 (henceforth designated MSP-1D). We particularly focus on the arrangements of the subunits within the processed complex and their mutual interactions. Using synthetic polynucleotides encoding MSP-1D and processing fragments thereof, we recovered the various proteins in highly purified and soluble form from E. coli. These materials enabled us to reassemble in vitro the MSP-1 complex from its subunits and to probe its conformation in comparison to the unprocessed MSP-1 precursor isolated from E. coli as well as from parasites. Based on our data, we propose a structural model for MSP-1, which will now allow addressing more specifically longstanding questions concerning structure-function relationships of this intriguing protein. Cloning and Expression of msp-1d Sequences—Sequences encoding the MSP-1D processing fragments p83, p30, p38, and p42 (21Stafford W.H. Blackman M.J. Harris A. Shai S. Grainger M. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR using a synthetic gene coding for msp-1 from P. falciparum strain 3D7 (19.Tuerbachova, I. (2000) Synthese des Hauptoberflaechenproteins MSP-1 aus Plasmodium falciparum in Toxoplasma gondii: Untersuchungen zur Struktur und Funktion. Ph.D. thesis, Universitaet HeidelbergGoogle Scholar). The DNAs encoding p83/30 and p38/42 were generated accordingly. All PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. Unique ClaI cleavage sites at the 5′ ends of the PCR products allowed their cloning downstream of glutathione S-transferase (GST) or His6 encoding sequences within appropriately modified pZE13 expression vectors (22Lutz R. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Similarly, unique XbaI or PstI sites at the 3′ ends were used for downstream fusions of His6 or Strep (IBA, Germany) tags. Some sequences were fused to produce proteins containing tags on either end (Fig. 1). The pZE13 derivate was transferred to E. coli strain W3110Z1 (22Lutz R. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar) where the expression of the target gene is tightly controlled via isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Purification of p190 and Fragments Thereof from E. coli Extracts— Full size p190 fused N-terminal to GST and C-terminal to His6 (pg190h) was expressed in soluble form in E. coli at 25 °C and purified by Ni2+-chelate chromatography followed by separation on GSH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). A GMP compatible production process and the thorough characterization of the resulting protein preparation will be described in detail in a forthcoming publication. MSP-1 fragments p83, p30, p38, and p42 were prepared from inclusion bodies as described (23Epp C. Kauth C.W. Bujard H. Lutz R. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Appl. 2003; 786: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies of the respective proteins were solubilized in buffer 1 (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole) and applied to a Ni2+-chelate column equilibrated with buffer 1. After washing with buffer 2 (buffer 1 containing 15 mm imidazole), proteins were eluted with buffer 3 (buffer 1 containing 300 mm imidazole). Fragments p83/30 and p38/42 were also recovered from E. coli as inclusion bodies. The p83/30 material was dissolved in buffer 1 before it was subjected to Ni2+-chelate chromatography. After washing with buffer 2, proteins were eluted with buffer 3. The eluted material was renatured by dialysis against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m arginine, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA. After subsequent dialysis against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, the protein was adsorbed on streptactin-Sepharose (IBA, Germany) and eluted with the same buffer containing 5 mm d-desthiobiotin. Protein p38/42, recovered as inclusion body, was dissolved under denaturing conditions and refolded by pulse renaturation as described previously (23Epp C. Kauth C.W. Bujard H. Lutz R. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Appl. 2003; 786: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The renatured protein was applied onto a Ni2+-chelate column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole. After a first (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, 1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine) and a second (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole) washing step, the protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole. The fractions containing p38/42 were applied to an affinity column containing monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5.2 fixed to Sepharose via protein A, equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. After washing with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 650 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, the protein was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5. The eluate was immediately neutralized with 0.2 volumes of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. Protein content of eluted fractions was determined by Bradford assay. Purification of Full-length MSP-1 from Merozoites—Parasite-derived MSP-1 was isolated from the trophozoite/early schizont fraction of synchronized parasitized red blood cells Late schizonts were removed by passing the culture through a column for magnetic cell separation (MACS, Miltenyi Biotech). The parasitized red blood cells were lysed by 0.01% saponin and MSP-1 was purified by mAb 5.2 specific affinity chromatography (see above) as described previously (24.Tolle, R. (1994) Untersuchungen zur Seroepidemiologie und Protektivität zweier Antigene des Malariaerregers Plasmodium falciparum. Ph.D. thesis, Universitaet HeidelbergGoogle Scholar). Assembly of MSP-1 Complexes from Subunits—For coexpression of two msp-1 sequences in E. coli, pZE23 and pZE13 (22Lutz R. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar) were used, which because of their different antibiotic markers, could be simultaneously maintained in vivo. In both vectors, the target gene is induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. For assembly of MSP-1 complexes via corenaturation of subunits, 0.5 mg of solubilized affinity purified MSP-1 fragments were mixed at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml each in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, 300 mm imidazole, and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against refolding buffer (0.5 m arginine, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm GSH, 0.1 mm GSSG, 1 mm EDTA) followed by a dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, for 16 h at 4 °C. Association of purified and renatured MSP-1 subunits was examined by incubating 0.2 mg of the respective proteins usually in the presence of a 6-fold excess of BSA in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 2 h at room temperature or for 8 h at 4 °C. In all three approaches, complex formation was monitored via affinity chromatography exploiting the various tags or the mAb 5.2 epitope as described above. Respective fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie or immunostaining. Thrombin Cleavage of MSP-1, p190, p83/30, and p38/42—For thrombin proteolysis, purified E. coli-derived proteins at concentrations between 0.1 and 0.3 mg/ml or native MSP-1 were incubated with thrombin (Roche Diagnostics) at a ratio of 2 units/100 μg of protein at 25 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. At different time points, 100-μl samples were removed, mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer with or without 100 mm DTT, and immediately heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Aliquots of these samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To examine the interaction of MSP-1 subunits after thrombin cleavage, the digestion products were subjected to affinity chromatography and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Microsequencing and Peptide Fingerprint—For microsequencing of the MSP-1 cleavage products, the proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and stained with a solution containing 0.1% Amido Black and 2% acetic acid. The membrane was destained with methanol until the protein bands became visible. The fragments of interest were excised and analyzed on a protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using standard techniques. Peptide fingerprints were performed by subjecting the excised protein fragment to trypsin digestion followed by mass spectroscopic analyses of the resulting cleavage products. Whenever this method was used to determine molecular weights of polypeptides, coverage was around 40%. Antibodies—MAb 5.2 (25Siddiqui W.A. Tam L.Q. Kan S.C. Kramer K.J. Case S.E. Palmer K.L. Yamaga K.M. Hui G.S. Infect. Immun. 1986; 52: 314-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was prepared from the hybridoma cell line HB9148 (ATCC); mAb 7.6, mAb 7.5, mAb 2.2, mAb 12.8, and mAb 12.10 (2McBride J.S. Heidrich H.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 23: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) were generous gifts from Dr. Jana McBride. Sera against p83, p30, p38, and p42 were obtained by immunizing rabbits intramuscularly with 100 μg of the respective recombinant protein purified from E. coli and emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant. Animals were boosted at days 21 and 42 with the same antigen dose in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The sera used were harvested 10 days after the second boost. Experimental Strategy—The mature MSP-1 complex is generated by in situ proteolytic cleavage of a large surface anchored precursor protein. The interactions between some of its subunits may, therefore, be restrained by parameters that have governed the folding of the unprocessed molecule at the surface of the parasite and by interactions of the complex with other surface proteins. To study the interactions between heterologously produced MSP-1 subunits, we have, therefore, followed three experimental approaches: (i) coexpression of MSP-1 fragments in E. coli; (ii) co-renaturation of fragments isolated from E. coli extracts; and (iii) incubation of stoichiometric mixtures of isolated and separately renatured fragments. The first two procedures were assumed to allow the proteins to interact in an early state of folding, whereas the third approach would reveal direct associations between folded MSP-1 subunits. Complexes formed by combining various MSP-1 fragments were isolated by affinity chromatography exploiting either tags, such as GST, specific for only one of the participating proteins, or the unique epitope within the C terminus of p42 recognized by mAb 5.2. The affinity purified material was then further analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To delineate potential protease accessible linker regions and more compact domains within MSP-1, thrombin appeared to be a suitable enzyme because the primary sequence of MSP-1D contains around 80 sequence motifs susceptible to thrombin cleavage. A quantitative evaluation of resulting digestion patterns would, in addition, provide information on the structural homogeneity of respective protein preparations. Synthesis in E. coli and Isolation of MSP-1 and MSP-1 Processing Fragments—Synthetic DNA sequences encoding the entire MSP-1 (without the N-terminal 19 amino acid signal peptide) or various processing fragments thereof were placed in expression vectors of the pZ plasmid family (22Lutz R. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar), where their expression could be controlled by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The coding sequences were modified at the 3′ and 5′ ends to produce proteins fused to His6, GST or Strep tags, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. Full size MSP-1 fused N-terminal to GST and C-terminal to His6 (pg190h) was expressed in soluble form in E. coli.Ni2+-chelate chromatography followed by separation on GSH-Sepharose led to a highly purified and homogeneous product. MSP-1 fragments p83/30 and p38/42 as well as p83, p30, p38, and p42 were recovered from E. coli as insoluble inclusion bodies. The p83/30 material was purified by Ni2+-chelate chromatography under denaturing conditions before it was renatured and subjected to streptactin affinity chromatography, from which it was recovered as homogeneous soluble protein. Inclusion bodies containing His6-tagged p38/42, p83, p30, p38, or p42, respectively, were dissolved under denaturing conditions and the proteins were refolded as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ni2+-chelate and whenever possible immunoaffinity chromatography using mAb 5.2 led to highly purified, homogeneous and soluble products. As will be shown below, digestion of full size MSP-1 as well as of MSP-1 fragments with thrombin yielded highly defined and consistent cleavage patterns supporting the view that the proteins are properly folded. p83/30 and p38/42 Form a Stable Complex in Vivo and in Vitro—As the formation of the natural MSP-1 complex may be facilitated by interactions within the precursor molecule in statu nascendi, we first examined whether simultaneous expression of p83/30 and p38/42 in E. coli would allow the two “halves” to form a complex. For sustained coexpression, the sequences encoding these proteins were inserted into two different backbones of the pZ plasmid family. Affinity chromatography of respective E. coli extracts on GSH-Sepharose revealed that indeed p38/42 was retained on the column whenever GST-tagged p83/30 was present indicating a specific association between the two proteins (Fig. 2A). When purified denatured p83/30 and p38/42 were mixed and subjected to refolding conditions in the presence of BSA, efficient complex formation takes place as well (Fig. 2B). To further examine whether the two halves of MSP-1 are capable of assembling in a refolded state or whether they require a state proceeding the final folding, stoichiometric mixtures of separately purified and refolded p83/30 and p38/42 were incubated for 2 h at 25 °C in the presence of excess BSA and probed for complex formation by immunoaffinity chromatography using mAb 5.2. As shown in Fig. 2C, p83/30 is efficiently retained revealing its affinity for p38/42. Together, these results demonstrate that the MSP-1 complex can be assembled from its two halves refolded in vitro and that no folding intermediate of the precursor is required for this association. p38/42 Interacts with p30 but Not with p83—To delineate more closely the domains responsible for the interaction between the MSP-1 subunits, we investigated first whether p83 or p30 alone may bind to the C-terminal half. Accordingly, p30 and p38/42 were simultaneously produced in E. coli, and indeed a complex containing p30 and p38/42 can be recovered in good yields by GSH affinity chromatography (Fig. 2D). The analogous experiment with p83 and p38/42 yielded, however, no clear result because of the instability of p83 in E. coli (data not shown). Therefore, purified and separately renatured preparations of p83 and p38/42 were incubated together in the presence of BSA before the mixture was subjected to mAb 5.2-specific immunoaffinity chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2E, the eluate did not contain p83 excluding an efficient interaction between p83 and p38/42. Together, these results indicate that p30 but not p83 interacts with p38/42. Interaction between Individual MSP-1 Fragments—To investigate which of the naturally occurring primary processing products of MSP-1 are the major interaction partners within the mature complex and how they may cooperate in complex stabilization, we analyzed the association between various purified and denatured proteins when refolded together. This approach allowed us to trap associated proteins via affinity chromatography as described above. The results of these experiments, of which a representative sample is summarized in Fig. 3, show that p83 and p42 do not interact to any significant degree (Fig. 3A). By contrast, p30 shows a distinct affinity to p42 (Fig. 3B) that appears, however, not as strong as the association between p42 and p38 (Fig. 3C) as well as between p83 and p30 (Fig. 3D). Coexpression of p30 and p38 revealed an efficient interaction between these two subunits. These data are consistent with results shown in Fig. 2 where p83/30 but not p83 would interact with p38/42. The latter result is also supported by experiments in which p42, p38, and p83 were corenatured and where the resulting complex did not contain p83 (data not shown). Several controls, for simplicity not shown here, are consistent with these results. For example, incubating separately renatured pg30 with ph42 followed by GSH chromatography reveals the p30/p42 complex, whereas when omitting pg30 no p42 is recovered from the column etc. Assembly of the Intact MSP-1 Complex from Its Major Processing Products—The above experiments demonstrate that specific complexes can be assembled by corenaturation of various MSP-1 fragments. We, therefore, attempted to reassociate the entire MSP-1 from its major processing products p83, p30, p38, and p42. Indeed, when the proteins in their denatured form were mixed and renatured together, a substantial fraction of the material is recovered by mAb 5.2 specific immunoaffinity chromatography indicating the formation of a complex that contains all four processing fragments. The specificity of the affinity chromatography applied was examined by corenaturing p83, p30, and p38 with p33. As the latter protein is missing the C-terminal portion of p42 carrying the 5.2 epitope, a respective complex is not expected to be retained as shown in Fig. 4A. All experiments described here were carried out with MSP-1 fragments derived from P. falciparum strain 3D7, a representative of the MAD20 prototype. To examine whether some of the structural motifs responsible for the subunit interactions may be conserved between MSP-1D and MSP-1F from the FCB-1 strain, a representative of the K1 prototype, we corenatured p83, p30, and p38 from strain 3D7 with p42 of MSP-1F. As the epitope of mAb 5.2 is located in the highly conserved C-terminal region, our standard affinity chromatography could be applied for the identification of the complex. Fig. 4B shows that the heterologous complex is indeed efficiently formed. Examining the Structure of MSP-1 by Proteolysis with Thrombin—To probe the conformation of MSP-1 as well as the homogeneity of our protein preparations, we exposed in a first experiment isolated and renatured p83/30 and p38/42 as well as full size p190 to thrombin. All these protein preparations were converted into defined sets of fragments revealing all together six cleavage sites of which three are within p83/30 and p38/42, respectively (Fig. 5). Moreover, the cleavage products were generated in nearly stoichiometric amounts. These results demonstrate that (i) the vast majority of the roughly 80 thrombin cleavage motifs are inaccessible for the enzyme and (ii) that our preparations consist of homogeneously folded proteins. Analysis of the cleavage products obtained from p83/30 and p38/42 digests by Edman degradation allowed us to identify and map all the fragments via their N-terminal sequence (Fig. 6A). The analysis also showed that, as expected, all cleavages occurred C-terminal to arginine or lysine residues and with one exception in regions predicted to be unstructured (Fig. 6B). The identity of various fragments was further confirmed by Western blot analysis and mass spectroscopy (data not shown).Fig. 6Map of thrombin cleavage sites within MSP-1.

We investigated the link between aberrant integrin expression, Erk activation, and expression of IL-1α. Transgenic keratinocytes had higher basal Erk activity and IL-1α levels than nontransgenic controls and were more sensitive to stimulation of Erk activity and IL-1α production by IL-1α, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and serum. Inhibition of Erk in transgenic keratinocytes reduced basal IL-1α levels and the stimulation of IL-1α production by serum or phorbol ester, demonstrating that Erk could regulate IL-1α expression. TPA or IL-1α treatment resulted in rapid down-regulation of the EGF receptor in transgenic cells, indicative of transactivation. Inhibition of transactivation blocked basal and TPA or IL-1α induced Erk activation, but not IκBα degradation, and abolished increased IL-1α production in transgenic cells. In transgene-negative cells, constitutive activation of IL-1-dependent signaling by wild type or kinase-dead IRAK1 stimulated IL-1α production independent of Erk. We conclude that suprabasal integrin expression leads to Erk activation and increased IL-1α expression by potentiating activation of the EGF receptor. These results provide a mechanism by which aberrant integrin expression triggers epidermal hyperproliferation and inflammation.

These results provide a mechanism by which aberrant integrin expression triggers epidermal hyperproliferation and inflammation. Extracellular matrix receptors of the β1 integrin family play a role in normal epidermal proliferation, differentiation, and homeostasis (1Watt F.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3919-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Integrin expression is normally confined to the basal layer of the epidermis. However, in benign hyperproliferative conditions, such as wound healing and psoriasis, integrins are also expressed in the suprabasal, differentiating cell layers. To analyze the significance of suprabasal integrin expression, transgenic mice have been generated in which individual human integrin subunits are expressed under the control of the involucrin promoter (2Carroll J.M.

Mice expressing a β1 transgene (Invβ1 mice) are crossed with mice expressing α2, α3, or α5 integrin transgenes (Invα2, Invα3, or Invα5 animals) to generate mice with the corresponding suprabasal integrin heterodimers: α2β1, α3β1, or α5β1. The mice have a sporadic hyperproliferative phenotype with skin inflammation that bears some resemblance to the human skin disease, psoriasis.

In affected lesions of integrin transgenic mice and human psoriasis, there is activation of Erk MAPK in suprabasal integrin-positive cells (5Haase I. Hobbs R.M. Romero M.R. Broad S. Watt F.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of Erk in cultured human keratinocytes recreates the hyperproliferation and per-turbed differentiation that are characteristic of psoriasis. In addition, keratinocytes from transgenic mice produce more interleukin-1α (IL-1α) than cells from wild type mice independent of integrin ligation (5Haase I. Hobbs R.M. Romero M.R. Broad S. Watt F.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).

Cell Culture—Spontaneously immortalized murine keratinocyte lines derived from the skin of adult Invα2β1 and negative control mice (passages 25–45) were cultured in FAD medium (one part Ham's F-12 medium, three parts Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 0.18 mm adenine) supplemented with 10% FCS and HICE mixture (0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10—10m cholera toxin, and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor) (complete medium) in the absence of J2–3T3 feeder cells at 32 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 (3Romero M.R.

To induce stratification of primary keratinocytes, cells were transferred to standard (“high calcium”) complete medium overnight. For some experiments preconfluent cells were starved overnight in FAD + 0.5% FCS (without HICE mixture) before addition of cytokines, growth factors, or other stimuli. IL-1α ELISAs—To determine intracellular levels of IL-1α, cells were washed in PBS and then lysed in 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were assayed for protein content using the BCA assay and diluted to 10 μg of total protein/ml in 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Samples were assayed for IL-1α levels by ELISA according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using a paired Student's t test. Protein Extraction, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—For Western blotting cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described previously (5Haase I.

Detection of IL-1α and icIL-1ra on blots required an overnight incubation with the antibodies in 5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline. Densitometry of bands produced by Western blotting was carried out using NIH Image version 1.58. Cytokine Neutralization by Antibodies—Cells were washed twice in FAD + 0.5% FCS and then transferred for ∼16 h to FAD + 0.5% FCS, containing the appropriate antibodies at the following concentrations: goat anti-IL-1α, 0.2 μg/ml; rat anti-IL-1α, 5 μg/ml; anti-IL-6, 0.4 μg/ml; anti-GM-CSF, 0.4 μg/ml; anti-TNF-α,1 μg/ml; anti-TGF-β,1 μg/ml; and anti-human β1 integrin, 0.1 mg/ml.

Both IRAK1 constructs were removed from pBK-RSV by EcoRI/XbaI digestion and blunted with Klenow fragment plus dNTPs. The resulting purified cassettes were ligated into the retroviral vector pBabe puro that had been digested with BamHI and also blunted. The pBabe puro vector (23Morgenstern J.P. Land H.

Retrovirus-containing supernatant was incubated with the transgene-negative murine keratinocyte line in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml Polybrene. After 2–3 days, 2.5 μg/ml puromycin was added to select for infected cells. Flow cytometric analysis of EGFP expression in live cells showed that, after selection, ∼40% of cells were expressing the retroviral vector. Intracellular Levels of IL-1α Correlate with Erk MAPK Activity in Primary Transgenic Mouse Keratinocytes—We previously reported that immortalized keratinocytes derived from an Invα2β1 transgenic mouse express more IL-1α than keratinocytes from a transgene-negative control (5Haase I.

We confirmed and extended the correlation between suprabasal integrin expression and IL-1α expression by examining primary keratinocytes from transgene-negative mice and from Invβ1 and Invα2β1 animals. When grown as a monolayer in low calcium medium, transgene-positive keratinocytes contained more pro-IL-1α (Fig. 1) and secreted more IL-1α (data not shown) than transgene-negative cells. The increased IL-1α expression correlated with increased basal Erk activity, both in low serum medium (Fig. 1) and in complete medium (data not shown). When transgene-negative or -positive cells were induced to stratify and accumulate differentiated cells in high calcium medium, the levels of IL-1α and active Erk decreased in unison (Fig. 1). The decrease in Erk activity is consistent with the described role of Erk in maintaining proliferation and inhibiting differentiation of keratinocytes (5Haase I. Hobbs R.M. Romero M.R. Broad S.

Luger T.A. Lowry D. Perry P. Roop D.R. Mountz J.D. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2274-2278PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gruaz-Chatellard D. Baumberger C. Saurat J.H. Dayer J.M.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 2955-2963PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, icIL-1ra tended to accumulate along with differentiation markers such as the cornified envelope precursor cornifin (Fig. 1), also in agreement with earlier observations (28Gruaz-Chatellard D. Baumberger C. Saurat J.H. Dayer J.M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Corradi A. Franzi A.T. Rubartelli A. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These data confirm that transgenic keratinocytes express more IL-1α than controls and establish a correlation with increased basal Erk MAPK activity. They also suggest that icIL-1ra is not positively regulated by Erk. Transgenic Keratinocytes Show Enhanced Induction of IL-1α and Erk Activity in Response to External Stimuli—The increased sensitivity of Invα2β1 and Invα3β1 mouse skin to TPA (4Owens D.M. Watt F.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5248-5254PubMed Google Scholar) led us to investigate whether the enhanced Erk activity and IL-1α production in transgenic keratinocytes extended to cells exposed to TPA and a variety of other stimuli. Negative and Invα2β1 cells that had been starved overnight were treated with IL-1α, TPA, EGF, TGF-β, or IL-6. NFκB activity is known to regulate IL-1α expression in fibroblasts (31Kheradmand F. Werner E. Tremble P. Symons M. Werb Z. Science. 1998; 280: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 32Werner E. Kheradmand F. Isberg R.R. Werb Z. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3333-3343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and degradation of IκBα was used to monitor NFκB pathway activation (33Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). The level of phospho-Erk1/2 was used to measure Erk activation (Fig. 2). IL-6 and TGF-β did not activate the Erk or NFκB pathways to any great extent and did not induce IL-1α (Fig. 2). Instead, TGF-β reduced IL-1α expression in Invα2β1 cells, probably reflecting its known inhibitory effect on NFκB signaling (34Xiao Y.Q. Malcolm K. Worthen G.S. Gardai S. Schiemann W.P. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14884-14893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In transgene-positive and -negative cells, IL-1α activated Erk and induced degradation of IκBα; TPA and EGF activated Erk but did not affect IκBα levels. All three stimuli efficiently induced pro IL-1α. icIL-1ra expression, on the other hand, was not responsive to any of the stimuli tested, agreeing with the suggestion that regulation of the IL-1 network in keratinocytes is principally dependent upon modulation of IL-1α and not icIL-1ra levels (35Phillips W.G. Feldmann M. Breathnach S.M. Brennan F.M. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1995; 101: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Transgene-positive cells showed increased sensitivity to IL-1α, TPA, and EGF, in terms of Erk activation, IκBα degradation, and pro-IL-1α expression (Fig. 2). In transgene-negative cells, the order of efficiency of Erk activation was IL-1α < TPA < EGF, whereas in Invα2β1 cells it was IL-1α < EGF < TPA. The time course of Erk and NFκB activation was monitored following IL-1α, EGF, or TPA treatment of transgene-negative and Invα2β1 cells that had been starved overnight (Fig. 3). The kinetics of Erk activation triggered by IL-1α were largely similar in both cell types, except that activation was slightly more sustained in Invα2β1 cells (see 30-min time point in Fig. 3A). The kinetics of activation triggered by EGF were also similar in transgene-negative and Invα2β1 cells, although again the activation was extended in the Invα2β1 cells (see 30-min time point in Fig. 3A). Although transgene-positive cells had a lower basal level of IκBα (Figs. 2 and 3B), activation of the NFκB pathway in response to IL-1α was essentially identical in negative and Invα2β1 cells, as shown by similar time courses of IκBα Ser32/36 phosphorylation and subsequent degradation and resynthesis of total IκBα (Fig. 3B). In response to TPA, a massively sustained Erk activation was observed in Invα2β1 cells compared with negative cells (Fig. 3A). Significant Erk activity was still observable in Invα2β1 cells after6hofTPA treatment, whereas in transgene-negative cells Erk activation was down-regulated within 30 min after TPA treatment. The time course of IκBα phosphorylation and degradation in response to TPA was similar in both negative and Invα2β1 cells, indicating equal activation of the NFκB pathway (Fig. 3B). Basal and Induced IL-1α Levels Are Sensitive to Inhibition of the Erk MAPK Pathway—To test the hypothesis that Erk could regulate IL-1α expression, Invα2β1 keratinocytes were treated for 16 h in complete medium with inhibitors of a variety of signaling molecules. IL-1α levels in cell lysates were determined by ELISA and compared with those present in lysates from untreated (DMSO) transgene-positive (Invα2β1) and -negative (Neg) cells (Fig. 4A). Inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB203580), protein kinase C (Bisindolylmaleimide), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002) had only minor effects on IL-1α levels. However, treatment with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 or the reportedly potent and specific NFκB inhibitor CAPE (36Bian Z.M. Elner S.G. Yoshida A. Kunkel S.L. Su J. Elner V.M. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 73: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 37Natarajan K. Singh S. Burke Jr., T.R. Grunberger D. Aggarwal B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9090-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar) reduced IL-1α expression to the levels found in control cells. These data indicate that increased activation of both the NFκB and Erk pathways could account for the increased IL-1α production in Invα2β1 cells. To investigate whether induced as well as basal IL-1α production required Erk activity, Invα2β1 and negative control keratinocytes that had been starved overnight were simulated with TPA, IL-1α, or 10% serum for 6 h and then IL-1α levels in lysates were assayed by ELISA (Fig. 4B). All three stimuli induced IL-1α in both negative and Invα2β1 cells, with TPA having the greatest effect (see also Fig. 2). However, the increase in IL-1α production was considerably greater in transgene-positive cells, particularly in response to TPA, which increased IL-1α levels ∼16-fold in Invα2β1 cells compared with 5-fold in control cells. Cells were incubated with inhibitors to either the Erk or p38 MAPK pathways prior to stimulation and IL-1α levels assayed as before (Fig. 4B). The p38 inhibitor was included because IL-1α activates p38 in keratinocytes (5Haase I. Hobbs R.M. Romero M.R. Broad S. Watt F.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Inhibiting the Erk pathway significantly reduced induction of IL-1α in response to both serum and TPA, although not to IL-1α itself. p38 MAPK inhibition had little effect on induction of IL-1α except in the case of IL-1α-stimulated Invα2β1 cells. Activity of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Is Required for TPA-induced Erk Activation and IL-1α Synthesis—Activation of Erk by TPA has recently been shown to involve transactivation of the EGF receptor via MMP activation and shedding of membrane-bound HB-EGF (38Chen N. Ma W.Y. She Q.B. Wu E. Liu G. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46722-46728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As Erk is involved in TPA-induced IL-1α production and Invα2β1 cells produce a sustained Erk activation in response to TPA, a role for the EGFR and its ligands was investigated. To manipulate the activity of the EGFR, we used the specific inhibitor AG1478 and to alter the activity of heparin-binding EGFR ligands, soluble heparin was added to the culture medium (39Cook P.W. Damm D. Garrick B.L. Wood K.M. Karkaria C.E. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Abraham J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 40Kalmes A. Vesti B.R. Daum G. Abraham J.A. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Preincubation with AG1478 largely abolished TPA-induced Erk activation in both negative and Invα2β1 cells, whereas addition of heparin slightly inhibited the duration of Erk activation i.e. potentiated the down-regulation of Erk activity (Fig. 5, A and B). These results suggested that TPA-induced Erk activation was indeed dependent on EGFR transactivation and that shedding of heparin-binding EGFR ligands could have a role in this process. We also examined the effects of AG1478 and heparin on TPA-induced IL-1α synthesis (Fig. 5C). AG1478 reduced IL-1α induction in Invα2β1 cells from 18- to 12-fold, whereas heparin produced a small degree of inhibition that was not statistically significant. It is interesting to note that in Invα2β1 cells TPA-induced IL-1α synthesis was blocked to a similar extent with both the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 and the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (Figs. 5C and 4B). This implies that EGFR transactivation is responsible for the Erk pathway activation that occurs in TPA-induced IL-1α synthesis. Inhibition of the EGFR Blocks IL-1α-stimulated Erk Activation but Has No Effect on NFκB Activation—TNF-α, which activates similar signaling pathways to IL-1, transactivates the EGFR and other members of the ErbB receptor family (41Hemi R.

Recently, it has become increasingly obvious that this linear polysaccharide has many more uses than simply scaffolding or space filler. HA has been found to be involved in development, cell signaling, cell motility, and metastasis. These roles are often dictated by the length of the HA polymer, which can vary from a few to about 10,000 sugar residues in length. Three distinct isoforms of HA synthase exist in mammals. It has been shown previously by others that each isoform produces HA that differs in size distribution, but the regulatory mechanism is not yet known. Mutations have been described that alter the size distribution of the HA produced by the streptococcal HA synthases. We show that by mutating one particular amino acid residue of a vertebrate HA synthase, depending on the introduced side chain, the size of HA produced can be either reduced or increased. We postulate that several cysteine residues and a serine residue may be involved in binding directly or indirectly to the nascent HA chain. These data support the theory that the relative strength of the interaction between the catalyst and the polymer may be a major factor in HA size control.

The enzymes that catalyze the formation of HA, the HA synthases, are dual action glycosyltransferases that catalyze the transfer of both GlcUA and GlcNAc (1Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol.

Life Sci. 1999; 56: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The membrane-associated enzymes utilize UDP-linked sugar precursors in the cytosol and extrude the growing HA chain through the plasma membrane (1Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol.

The roles that HA plays in the vitreous humor of the eye (5Meyer K. Palmer J. J. Biol.

Acta. 1972; 279: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) have been known for many years. Considering the high concentration of HA (>100 mg/liter) in these areas (7Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.

Only recently have a wider variety of roles for HA been discovered. In vertebrates, HA is also involved in development, cell migration, and signaling (9Tammi M.I. Day A.J. Turley E.A. J. Biol.

The sizes of the HA molecules involved appear to dictate their biological activities (12Camenisch T.D. McDonald J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

The basis for size control of HA product has recently begun to be investigated (53Heldermon C. Kumari K. Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Weigel P.H. Weigel P.H. New Frontiers in Medical Sciences: Redefining Hyaluronan. Elsevier Science, Padua, Italy1999: 41-50Google Scholar). It is likely that the differences in the HAS sequences of the different isoforms are responsible at least in part for the variation in HA size distribution. One or more residues that are conserved between species but vary between isoforms may be responsible for the differences in HA size distribution. This hypothesis is based on the fact that when the different recombinant enzymes are expressed in the same system, the HA product size differs. In most experiments, a recombinant vector was used to express a HAS gene either in a foreign host, yeast, or in a HA-deficient mammalian cell line. In a direct comparison utilizing membrane preparations from yeast, spHAS (from Streptococcus pyogenes) made larger HA polymers than xlHAS1 (from Xenopus laevis, originally called DG42) in vitro (54Pummill P.E. Achyuthan A.M. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4976-4981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Murine HAS1, 2, and 3 were also directly compared in vitro and in vivo (48Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). First, membrane preparations derived from mammalian cells transfected with the various murine HAS isozymes demonstrated that the relative product size was HAS2 > HAS1 > HAS3. Second, HA in the culture medium from mammalian cells transfected with HAS1, 2, or 3 also showed differences; HAS1 and 3 appeared to produce HA with more equivalent size distributions in vivo but still smaller than HAS2. Another group showed that the size distribution of HA products formed by xlHAS1 and xlHAS2 differed substantially when examined in vitro (51Koprunner M. Mullegger J. Lepperdinger G. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition to regulation via the innate kinetics or enzymological properties of the HASs, control of the precursor levels has been hypothesized as being important for size control. Certain treatments (e.g. proinflammatory cytokines) can cause cells to increase the expression of UDP-Glc dehydrogenase (55Spicer A.P. Kaback L.A. Smith T.J. Seldin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25117-25124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The actual levels of UDP-GlcUA were not measured, but it was postulated that HA production could be regulated by such a mechanism. The predominant HA size control mechanism, whether intrinsic factors (e.g. enzymological properties of the synthase), extrinsic factors (e.g. UDP-sugar substrate concentration or substrate/enzyme ratio), or a combination of both, has not been reported. Recently, it was shown that mutation of certain single cysteine residues in spHAS and seHAS (from Streptococcus equisimilis) cause the enzyme preparations to either produce HA of smaller or slightly larger average size distribution than that of wild type enzyme in vitro (53Heldermon C. Kumari K. Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Weigel P.H. Weigel P.H. New Frontiers in Medical Sciences: Redefining Hyaluronan. Elsevier Science, Padua, Italy1999: 41-50Google Scholar, 56Kumari K.

We have used site-directed mutagenesis to examine the difference in the size distribution of HA produced by various mutants of a vertebrate enzyme, xlHAS1. We have not only discovered a variety of single mutations that cause either a smaller or a larger HA product but also one particular amino acid that can be mutated to give rise to either a smaller or a larger HA product depending on the substituting residue. We have also examined these mutants to assess whether there is a relationship between enzyme kinetics and chain length. Production of Recombinant xlHAS1 Wild Type, Cysteine Mutants, and Ser77 Mutant Enzymes—All of the reagents were from Sigma or Fisher unless noted otherwise. The construction and the use of the xlHAS1 expression plasmid for studies in yeast were previously described (54Pummill P.E. Achyuthan A.M. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4976-4981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 57DeAngelis P.L. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23657-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Basically, the xlHAS1 polypeptide was cloned into the pYES2 vector (Invitrogen) under control of the GAL1 promoter to form pYES/DG+. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pYES/DG+ using a QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene). Based on the preliminary results from photoaffinity labeling experiments probing the active site of xlHAS1, 2P. E. Pummill, R. R. Drake, and P. L. DeAngelis, unpublished observation. the Ser77 and Tyr107 codons were altered using pairs of synthetic oligonucleotides containing partially degenerate codons. For Ser77, the codon NNY (where N = any base and Y is C or T) was used to obtain a variety of mutants. For Tyr107, the codon TYT was used to obtain the Y107F mutant (Y107S was also generated but not investigated). Plasmids derived from independent transformants were sequenced to determine the identity of the substitution at residues 77 or 107 as well as to verify the entire open reading frame. The following Ser77 mutants were generated: alanine (S77A), aspartate (S77D), phenylalanine (S77F), isoleucine (S77I), threonine (S77T), valine (S77V), and tyrosine (S77Y/R271G; a secondary mutation was found upon sequencing). The cysteine mutants (C117S, C210S, C239S, C298S, C304S, C307S, and C337S) were obtained in a manner similar to that previously described (58Pummill P.E. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21610-21616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The plasmids were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae BJ5461 yeast (a pleiotrophic protease-deficient strain; Yeast Genetic Stock Center, Berkeley, CA) by the lithium acetate/poly(ethylene glycol) method (59Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Yeast with recombinant plasmids were routinely grown to a suitable biomass (A600 reached 0.3) in uracil-deficient synthetic medium with 0.1% glucose and 5% glycerol. Upon induction with galactose (final concentration, 1%), xlHAS1 wild type or mutant enzyme accumulated in the plasma membrane fraction. The crude membranes were prepared by disruption with silica/zirconia beads (0.5 mm) in a MiniBead-Beater-8 (Biospec) and harvested by ultracentrifugation. The membrane pellet was suspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 μm E-64, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin. Protein was quantitated by the Coomassie dye binding assay (Pierce) using a bovine serum albumin standard (60Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Polysaccharide Synthase Assays and Analyses—The incorporation of sugars into high molecular mass HA polysaccharide was monitored using UDP-[14C]GlcUA (∼290 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and/or UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (29.2 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) precursors as described previously (54Pummill P.E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23657-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, the crude membranes were incubated at 30 °C in Tris buffer, pH 7.5, with MgCl2 and the UDP-sugar precursors. Unincorporated, labeled UDP-sugars were separated from the HA product using paper chromatography. HA at the origin of the paper strip was detected by liquid scintillation counting. The assays were set so that <5% of the radiolabeled substrate was consumed and the enzyme concentration was in the linear range. All of the HAS assays throughout this work were performed in duplicate, and the values were averaged. The apparent Km values for the substrates were obtained by holding one radiolabeled UDP-sugar at a constant and saturating concentration while titrating the other UDP-sugar. Analysis of HA Product Size Distribution—The reactions were analyzed by either high performance gel filtration chromatography or agarose gel electrophoresis. For gel filtration analyses, the membranes (40–1400 μg of total protein) were incubated with 0.3–0.6 mm UDP-[14C]GlcUA (0.1–0.2 μCi) and 1.2–2.4 mm unlabeled UDP-GlcNAc in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 20 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C for various times. Control experiments validated that the HA product size was unaffected by the variations in UDP-sugar and enzyme concentrations. Membranes and the other reaction components were prewarmed separately to 30 °C prior to mixing to start the HAS reaction. At the end of the reaction time, the samples were either stopped by the addition of SDS to 2% (final concentration, w/v) or by addition of SDS to 0.5% followed by Pronase® treatment (final concentration, 1 mg/ml; overnight at 37 °C; Roche Applied Sciences). After Pronase digestion, the unincorporated precursors and small molecules were removed by ultrafiltration with a Microcon® 3 unit (three buffer changes; 3000 Da molecular mass cutoff; Amicon). The sizes of HA polymers were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography on a Phenomenex PolySep-GFC-P 5000 or 6000 column (300 × 7.8 mm) eluted with 0.2 m sodium nitrate at 0.6 ml/min on a Waters 600E system. All of the samples were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min prior to injection. Radioactive components were detected with a LB508 Radioflow Detector (EG & G Berthold) and Zinsser mixture (1.8 ml/min). The columns were standardized with various size dextrans (580, 145, 50, and 20 kDa) or, more appropriately, MANT-labeled HA with average molecular masses of 1300, 600, and 80 kDa (determined by MALLS). Each radiolabeled sample was spiked with an internal fluorescent dextran standard; elution times were reproducible to within 0.1 min. Because of discrepancies in the elution times of dextrans compared with HA, HA standards were made by substoichiometric labeling (∼1 MANT/50 monosaccharides) of hydroxyl groups of the streptococcal HA polysaccharide (1300 kDa by MALLS) with N-methylisatoic anhydride (61DeAngelis P.L. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The 600-kDa standard was obtained by subfractionation of bulk HA using preparative high pressure liquid chromatography. Extended ultrasonication (1% acetone in water, 2-min intervals for 30 min total on ice) of the bulk HA with a Heat Systems Ultrasonic W-380 sonicator with a MicrotipTM (power setting 4) was used to produce the 80-kDa standard. The size determination of HA standards was performed by MALLS. The HA polymers (100 μg) were loaded on two tandem Toso Biosep TSK-GEL columns (6000PWXL followed by 4000PWXL; each 7.8 mm × 30 cm) and eluted in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7, at 0.5 ml/min. The eluant flowed through an Optilab DSP interferometric refractometer and then a Dawn DSF laser photometer (632.8 nm; Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA) in the multi-angle mode. The software package of the manufacturer was used to determine the absolute average molecular mass using a dn/dC coefficient of 0.153. Some of the reactions treated with Pronase/Microcon were run on a 1.35% agarose gel in 1× TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.5) at 30 V for several hours. The gels were dried, and the labeled HA was visualized using a PhosphorImager™ and ImageQuant© software from Molecular Dynamics. The identity of the radiolabeled material as authentic HA was assessed by Streptomyces HA lyase digestion. Prior to gel drying, the 1-kb DNA ladder standard (Stratagene) was visualized by photography of ethidium bromide fluorescence upon exposure to UV light. HA sizes were estimated by comparison with the DNA standard according to a previous study (62Lee H.G. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Immunochemical Detection of Polypeptides—The xlHAS1 and mutant proteins were quantitated by Western blot analysis for assessment of the relative specific HAS activity. After SDS-PAGE separation, the proteins in the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose by semi-dry transfer. The blot was blocked with bovine serum albumin and incubated with the primary reagent composed of serum (1:1,000) from rabbits immunized with a fusion protein containing 1–166 residues of xlHAS1 (gift of I. Dawid; 50). Protein A-alkaline phosphatase detection with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium was used to visualize the immunoreactive bands. We have reported previously that xlHAS1 synthesizes HA at a rate of ∼80 monosaccharides/s and produces chains of between 3 × 106 and >2 × 107 Da (54Pummill P.E. Achyuthan A.M. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4976-4981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These sizes were based on results obtained on a Sephacryl S-500HR gel filtration column using dextrans (α1→6 glucans) as standards. In this study, we have determined that these dextran polymers elute after HA polymers of similar size (dextrans are probably more compact than HA polymer of the same molecular mass) on the Phenomenex PolySep columns. Based on the MANT-labeled authentic HA standards, we have revised the HAS-catalyzed elongation rate for xlHAS1 to ∼3 monosaccharides/s in vitro and the final product chain length to between 5 × 104 and 9 × 105 Da in vitro. This rate is similar to that of mmHAS3 (from mouse) expressed in fibroblasts (48Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), and the size range is similar to or slightly larger than that obtained for xlHAS1 expressed in COS-1 cells (2Spicer A.P.

Dev. 2000; 90: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), as determined by agarose gel analysis. We discovered that certain xlHAS1 mutants with substitutions for the serine at position 77 synthesize HA products with different size distribution (Table I). Of the Ser77 mutants created, S77F and S77I created a larger HA product and S77T created a smaller HA product. On the other hand, S77A, S77D, S77V, S77Y/R271G, and Y107F all made HA with an average size similar to that of wild type xlHAS1 (data not shown). As can be seen in Fig. 1, the average size of HA produced by S77T starts to fall behind that of wild type after ∼5 min. The average size of HA produced by S77T is smaller than that of wild type even after incubation for 60 min. S77F and S77I make HA with a larger average product size than wild type for all time points after 5 min.Table IEnzyme expression, HAS activity, and substrate affinityxlHAS1 enzymeProtein expressionHAS activityKmSize of HA compared with WTUDP-GlcNAcUDP-GlcUAWT++++400 ± 100; 260a0.6 mM UDP-GlcUA.190 ± 40S77A++++130a0.6 mM UDP-GlcUA.90equivalentS77D++NDbND, not determined.NDequivalentS77F++++160; 70a0.6 mM UDP-GlcUA.90 ± 50largerS77I+++90a0.6 mM UDP-GlcUA.50largerS77T++++460; 250a0.6 mM UDP-GlcUA.210 ± 60smallerS77V++++160a0.6 mM UDP-GlcUA.NDequivalentS77Y/R271G+++220; 150a0.6 mM UDP-GlcUA.90 ± 40equivalentY107F++++NDNDequivalentC117S++++340120largerC239S++++320110largerC337S++++400 ± 100700 ± 170smallera 0.6 mM UDP-GlcUA.b ND, not determined.

https://openalex.org/W2021541870,"α-Glucuronidases are key components of the ensemble of enzymes that degrade the plant cell wall. They hydrolyze the α1,2-glycosidic bond between 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid (4-O-MeGlcA) and the xylan or xylooligosaccharide backbone. Here we report the crystal structure of an inactive mutant (E292A) of the α-glucuronidase, GlcA67A, from Cellvibrio japonicus in complex with its substrate. The data show that the 4-O-methyl group of the substrate is accommodated within a hydrophobic sheath flanked by Val-210 and Trp-160, whereas the carboxylate moiety is located within a positively charged region of the substrate-binding pocket. The carboxylate side chains of Glu-393 and Asp-365, on the “β-face” of 4-O-MeGlcA, form hydrogen bonds with a water molecule that is perfectly positioned to mount a nucleophilic attack at the anomeric carbon of the target glycosidic bond, providing further support for the view that, singly or together, these amino acids function as the catalytic base. The capacity of reaction products and product analogues to inhibit GlcA67A shows that the 4-O-methyl group, the carboxylate, and the xylose sugar of aldobiouronic acid all play an important role in substrate binding. Site-directed mutagenesis informed by the crystal structure of enzyme-ligand complexes was used to probe the importance of highly conserved residues at the active site of GlcA67A. The biochemical properties of K288A, R325A, and K360A show that a constellation of three basic amino acids (Lys-288, Arg-325, and Lys-360) plays a critical role in binding the carboxylate moiety of 4-O-MeGlcA. Disruption of the apolar nature of the pocket created by Val-210 (V210N and V210S) has a detrimental effect on substrate binding, although the reduction in affinity is not reflected by an inability to accommodate the 4-O-methyl group. Replacing the two tryptophan residues that stack against the sugar rings of the substrate with alanine (W160A and W543A) greatly reduced activity. α-Glucuronidases are key components of the ensemble of enzymes that degrade the plant cell wall.

The microbial degradation of the plant cell wall is a critical biological process representing the primary mechanism by which carbon is recycled in the biosphere. Enzymes that hydrolyze the plant cell wall also have numerous biotechnological applications as the selective and complete hydrolysis of this macromolecular structure is of considerable industrial importance (1Coughlan M.P. Hazlewood G.P. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1993; 17: 259-289PubMed Google Scholar). Xylan, one of the most complex and abundant polysaccharides in the plant cell wall, is comprised of a backbone of β-1,4-linked d-xylopyranose units decorated with l-arabinofuranosyl, acetyl- and 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronyl substituents (2Brett C.T. Waldren K. Black M. Charlewood B. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls: Topics in Plant Functional Biology. 1. Chapman and Hall, London1996: 16-31Google Scholar). The extent and composition of these “side chains” varies between plant species and the extent of cellular differentiation (2Brett C.T. Waldren K. Black M. Charlewood B. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls: Topics in Plant Functional Biology. 1. Chapman and Hall, London1996: 16-31Google Scholar). The microbial hydrolysis of xylans is mediated by the action of an ensemble of different enzymes. The substituents are removed by a repertoire of glycoside hydrolases and carbohydrate esterases including arabinofuranosidases, α-glucuronidases, and acetyl-xylan esterases, (2Brett C.T. Waldren K. Black M. Charlewood B. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls: Topics in Plant Functional Biology. 1. Chapman and Hall, London1996: 16-31Google Scholar), whereas the xylose-containing polymeric backbone is hydrolyzed by endo-β1,4-xylanases (2Brett C.T. Waldren K. Black M. Charlewood B. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls: Topics in Plant Functional Biology. 1. Chapman and Hall, London1996: 16-31Google Scholar). Although the endo-acting xylanases have been extensively characterized, enzymes that remove the side chains have received less attention. Recent studies, however, have started to unravel the mechanism of action of α-glucuronidases. All the α-glucuronidases characterized to date are located in glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 1The abbreviations used are: GH, glycoside hydrolase family; 4-O-MeGlcA, 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid; GlcA67A, α-glururonidase from glycoside hydrolase family 67; GlcA, glucuronic acid. 67, in the Henrissat classification of carbohydrate active enzymes (see Refs. 3Henrissat B.

The majority are either membrane-bound or intracellular (5Nagy T. Emami K. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Humphry D.R. Gilbert H.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4925-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and hydrolyze the α1,2-glycosidic bond between 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid (4-O-MeGlcA) and the xylose moiety located at the non-reducing end of xylooligosaccharides (6Bronnenmeier K. Meissner H. Stocker S. Staudenbauer W.L. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These enzymes catalyze bond cleavage by an SN2-like single displacement mechanism in which water attacks the anomeric carbon of the uronic acid, concomitant with protonation of the glycosidic oxygen and leaving group departure, leading to inversion of anomeric configuration and the generation of the β-anomer of 4-O-MeGlcA as product (7Biely P. de Vries R.P. Vrsanska M. Visser J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Such a reaction involves both general acid assistance to leaving group departure and general base-catalyzed activation of the attacking water molecule (8Koshland D.E. Biol. Rev. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (819) Google Scholar). α-Glucuronidases are the only hemicellulases that hydrolyze sugar polymers containing functional groups other than hydroxyl moieties. The extent to which these enzymes exploit the carboxylate and methyl groups of 4-O-MeGlcA in substrate recognition is largely unknown. Recently the first three-dimensional structure of a α-glucuronidase was reported. The enzyme, GlcA67A, from Cellvibrio japonicus (previously known as Pseudomonas cellulosa) is a dimeric protein that comprises three domains. The N-terminal domain forms a two-layer β-sandwich, whereas the C-terminal domain consists mainly of long α-helices that form the dimer interface. The central domain is a classical (β/α)8 barrel that houses the catalytic apparatus. The structure of GlcA67A in complex with its reaction products implicated Glu-292 as the catalytic acid. Identification of the catalytic Brønsted base, however, was ambiguous (9Nurizzo D. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here we describe the structure of a catalytically inactive mutant of GlcA67A (E292A) in complex with its substrate aldobiouronic acid, the affinity of the enzyme for its reaction products, and the kinetic dissection of a series of active site mutants. The structural data show that both Glu-393 and Asp-365 are appropriately positioned to provide base catalysis and reveal that the carboxylate and methyl moieties of 4-O-MeGlcA are key determinants of substrate recognition. The carboxylate interacts with a constellation of three positively charged residues Lys-288, Arg-325, and Lys-360, whereas the 4-O-methyl group of 4-O-MeGlcA lies in a hydrophobic sheath flanked by Trp-160 and Val-210. We show that the three positively charged residues play a critical role in substrate recognition and whereas Val-210 is not strictly required to accommodate the 4-O-methyl group of 4-O-MeGlcA, replacing this aliphatic amino acid with a polar residue greatly reduces the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions—The Escherichia coli strains used in this study were TUNER (DE3) obtained from Novagen and XL1 Blue. The plasmid employed in this work, pTN1, was a recombinant of the expression vector pET32c, which expresses the mature form of GlcA67A fused to the C terminus of (His)10-thioredoxin (5Nagy T. Emami K. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Humphry D.R. Gilbert H.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4925-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To produce recombinant GlcA67A, E. coli TUNER (DE3) harboring pTN1 was cultured as described previously (5Nagy T. Emami K. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Humphry D.R. Gilbert H.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4925-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recombinant DNA Techniques—DNA manipulations were carried out essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the method used to sequence DNA was detailed by Nagy et al. (5Nagy T. Emami K. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Humphry D.R. Gilbert H.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4925-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the GlcA67A gene (glca67A) was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) employing the following primers: W160A, 5′-gttaaccatgcggataaccttaaccgtgtg-3′/5′-aaggttatccgcatggttaacaacacgatg-3′; V210A, 5′-atcaataatgcgaacgccgacccgcgtg-3′/5′-gcgggtcggcgttcgcattattgatcac-3′; V210G, 5′-atcaataatggcaacgccgacccgcgtg-3′/5′-gcgggtcggcgttgccattattgatcac-3′; V210N, 5′-atcaataataacaacgccgacccgcgtg-3′/5′gcgggtcggcgttgttattattgatcac-3′; V210S, 5′-atcaataatagcaacgccgacccgcgtg-3′/5′-gcgggtcggcgttgctattattgatcac-3′; K288A, 5′-ggtttcctggtggctgctgattctgaaggg-3′/5′-ttcagaatcagcagccaccaggaaaccgcc-3′; R325A, 5′-ggttttctgggccgcctttgtgtatcaccc-3′/5′-cacaaaggcggcccagaaaaccacaccgcc-3′; K360A, 5′-ctgcaaattgctaatggcccgattgatttc-3′/5′-gaaatcaatcgggccattagcaatttgcag-3′; W543A, 5′-gcgcagacgcgacggcggtttattaccatc-3′/5′-aaccgccgtcgcgtctgcgcgcggtaagtc-3′. The codon that was changed by site-directed mutagenesis is shown underlined. Purification of Proteins and Enzyme Assays—Wild-type and mutant forms of GlcA67A were purified as described by Nagy et al. (5Nagy T. Emami K. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Humphry D.R. Gilbert H.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4925-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to electrophoretic homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE. α-Glucuronidase activity was measured following the method of Biely et al. (11Biely P. Hirsch J. la Grange D.C. van Zyl W.H. Prior B.A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly 4-nitrophenyl-2-O-(4-O-methyl-α-d-glucuronosyl)-β-d-xylopyranoside, at concentrations ranging from 20 μm to 15 mm was incubated with an appropriate concentration of native or mutant GlcA67A in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumen and 60 μg of the Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum GH39 β-xylosidase, at 37 °C in a total volume of 500 μl. GlcA67A activity was determined by measuring the rate of release of 4-nitrophenol spectrophotometrically at 400 nm, using the molar extinction coefficient for 4-nitrophenol of 10,300 at pH 7.0 (12Charnock S.J. Lakey J.H. Virden R. Hughes N. Sinnott M.L. Hazlewood G.P. Pickersgill R. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2942-2951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The basis of the assay is that GlcA67A releases 4-O-MeGlcA from the substrate generating 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside that is hydrolyzed by the β-xylosidase releasing 4-nitrophenol. No 4-nitrophenol was generated in the absence of GlcA67A, and the addition of twice the amount of the α-glucuronidase doubled the rate of 4-nitrophenol production, verifying that the assay was measuring GlcA67A activity. The kinetic parameters kcat and KM were determined by non-linear regression analysis from three independent experiments, and at a minimum of six substrate concentrations. For some mutants the KM was too high for the determination of individual kinetic parameters as there was a linear relationship between substrate concentration (up to 15 mm) and initial rate. For these mutants the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) was determined from the slope of the line obtained from a plot of initial rate/enzyme concentration against substrate concentration. The Ki for the various reaction products was determined by measuring GlcA67A activity at four inhibitor concentrations between 0 and 200 mm, glucose; 0 and 200 mm, xylose; 0 and 50 mm, glucuronic acid (GlcA); 0 and 2 mm, 4-O-MeGlcA. The inhibitors were obtained from Sigma except 4-O-MeGlcA, which was prepared as follows: 800 mg of 4-O-methylglucuronoxylan (Sigma) was digested to completion with 800 units of the xylanase Xyn10A from C. japonicus (12Charnock S.J. Lakey J.H. Virden R. Hughes N. Sinnott M.L. Hazlewood G.P. Pickersgill R. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2942-2951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) in 25 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 12 mm citrate (PC) buffer, pH 6.5, for 16 h at 37 °C generating xylose, xylobiose, and aldotetraouronic acid as end products. The aldotetraouronic was hydrolyzed to completion with 200 units of GlcA67A in PC buffer for 16 h at 37 °C, to produce xylotriose and 4-O-MeGlcA as the only products. The 4-O-MeGlcA was purified by ion-exchange chromatography using Dowex 1X 2100–100G resin (Supelco) in the acetate form. Briefly, the digested 4-O-methylglucuronoxylan was applied to a 10-ml bed volume Dowex column under gravity flow. The column was then washed with 100 ml of water before uronic acid was eluted using 100 mm ammonium acetate. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and the amount of product was quantified by Dionex high performance liquid chromatography as described by Nagy et al. (5Nagy T. Emami K. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Humphry D.R. Gilbert H.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4925-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To determine the gross fold of wild-type and mutant forms of GlcA67A, proteins were subjected to circular dichroism spectroscopy using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. The spectra were obtained at a protein concentration of 500 μg/ml in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, at 25 °C using a 0.01-cm path length quartz cuvette (Hellma). Each spectrum was the accumulation of 5 scans between 195 and 250 nm at a scan rate of 50 nm/min, the band width was 2 nm. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing—The E292A mutant of GlcA67A was crystallized as described previously (9Nurizzo D. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and soaked with aldobiouronic acid. Data, at 100 K, were collected on beamline ID14-EH4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble France, using an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector. A single crystal of the E292A mutant of GlcA67A in complex with aldobiouronic acid was flash-cooled and indexed in the laboratory. Crystals belong to triclinic space group P1 with unit cell dimensions a = 69.4 Å, b = 74.4 Å, c = 87.5 Å, α = 115.1°, β = 93.0°, and γ = 109.4° and have two molecules in the asymmetric unit. A total of 500 images of 0.5° were collected in a unique orientation. Data were processed and scaled using the HKL suite of programs (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

The native GlcA67A coordinates, without water molecules, were used as a starting model for rigid body refinement in REFMAC and maintaining the same cross-validation reflections. Following rigid body refinement, maximum likelihood-based refinement of the atomic positions and temperature factors was performed with REFMAC (14Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar), interspersed with manual correction using the X-AUTOFIT option within QUANTA (Accelerys Inc. San Diego, CA). The ligand was added in the catalytic pocket and then water molecules were added automatically using REFMAC (14Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) and ARP-wARP (15Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) and inspected visually prior to deposition. Only those molecules that had good spherical electron density, reasonable B-factors, and hydrogen bond partners with appropriate geometry were retained in the model. Coordinates have been deposited with accession code 1H41. Crystal Structure of E292A with Aldobiouronic Acid—The three-dimensional structure of wild-type GlcA67A in complex with the reaction product xylose and/or the product analogue GlcA have been reported previously (9Nurizzo D. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the latter complexes GlcA was observed as its β-anomer, mimicking the product of an inverting attack upon the α-configured substrate. To study substrate, as opposed to product, recognition the structure of the catalytic acid mutant E292A was determined in complex with the substrate aldobiouronic acid at 1.5-Å resolution (Table I). Electron density is clear for the 4-O-MeGlcA moiety and the α-glycosidic linkage in this complex (Fig. 1). In contrast to the product complexes described previously, however, no strong density reflecting the xylosyl moiety is observed and this aglycone is presumed to be disordered. Compared with the product complex with GlcA, the pyranoside ring of the unhydrolyzed 4-O-MeGlcA likewise in 4C1 chair conformation, is rotated by ∼27 ° (pivoting about a similarly positioned O-4 atom), such that the C-1 atoms of the two sugars are separated by ∼1.4 Å (Fig. 2). Indeed, the location of the substrate, compared with product, yields sufficient space to observe the putative attacking water molecule perfectly poised for “in-line” inverting attack at C-1. A single solvent molecule lies, as expected, in van der Waals contact, 3.2 Å from C-1 with an OW-C1-O1 angle of ∼165 °. It is the absence of this water in the β-anomeric product complex described previously that allowed the product to swivel “upwards” to interact directly with the base pair of Asp-365 and Glu-393. The α-conformation of the glycosidic linkage in 4-O-MeGlcA supports the view that Asp-365 and/or Glu-393 act as the base catalyst; but one is not able to state with any certainty which one of the pair functions as the base, if indeed only one of them acts singly in this respect. Both the OD-1 atom of Asp-365 and the OE-1 atom of Glu-393 lie 2.6 Å from the putative attacking water and both display appropriate geometry to abstract a proton into their “anti” lone pair. The OD-1 of Asp-365 also lies 2.6 Å from the NZ amine of Lys-360, which may be an unusual environment for a group to act as a Brønsted base. Substituting either Asp-365 or Glu-393 with alanine rendered GlcA67A completely inactive, whereas the mutant E393C displays substantial activity leading to the suggestion that the aspartate functions as the catalytic base (9Nurizzo D. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This proposal, however, must be treated with caution as the equivalent mutation to E393C in other α-glucuronidases led to a substantial reduction in catalytic activity (16Zaide G. Shallom D. Shulami S. Zolotnitsky G. Golan G. Baasov T. Shoham G. Shoham Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3006-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Given the additional ambiguity of interpreting single substitutions of these carboxylates, one can only conclude that one or both contribute to base catalysis adding to the emerging picture that inverting glycosidases are rarely as simple to dissect as schematic pictures (typical of half the reaction coordinate in which the re-protonation and de-protonation of the catalytic acid and base, respectively, are not shown) suggest (17Koivula A. Ruohonen L. Wohlfahrt G. Reinikainen T. Teeri T.T. Piens K. Claeyssens M. Weber M. Vasella A. Becker D. Sinnott M.L. Zou J.Y. Kleywegt G.J. Szardenings M. Stahlberg J. Jones T.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 10015-10024Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As described above, it is perhaps surprising that the xylosyl moiety is not readily apparent in the substrate-enzyme complex, nor is the loop between residues Phe-327 and Glu-334. Consistent with these observations is the more “open” position of the tryptophan “drawbridge” provided by Trp-543 that should stack with the aglycone xyloside, and indeed does so in the product GlcA-Xyl complex of wild-type enzyme with β-GlcA in the -1 subsite and Xyl at +1. One may only speculate as to the origin of these observations, but the loss of the binding energy provided by the catalytic acid Glu-292 in the wild-type enzyme may be a contributing factor. Furthermore, the catalytic apparatus is evolved to stabilize a dissociated oxocarbenium ion-like transition state in which the C1-OR bond is quite extended (reflected in Brønsted βlg values tending toward -1 measured on analogous systems (18Sinnott M.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and not to provide optimal binding for a substrate complex with a 1.4-Å C1-OR bond. The 1500-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency displayed by the W543A mutant enzyme, described below, suggests that it is contributing greatly to catalysis, even if it is not bound to an ordered xylosyl moiety in the mutant x-ray structure. Characterization of GlcA67A Mutants—The structure of GlcA67A in complex with a range of ligands reveals the amino acids that are likely to play a key role in substrate binding and catalysis. Site-directed variants of the invariant amino acids (Fig. 3) that interact with the carboxylate and methyl moieties of 4-O-MeGlcA and the aromatic residues that stack against the sugar rings in the substrate aldobiouronic acid were therefore characterized. Each of the mutants was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity (Fig. 4). Circular dichroism spectra, recorded for all the mutants that display low activity (except E292A for which a crystal structure is available), were indistinguishable from wild-type enzyme indicating that the mutations did not significantly disrupt the protein fold (Fig. 5).Fig. 4SDS-PAGE of wild-type and mutant forms of GlcA67A. The proteins were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. The proteins in the various lanes are as follows: wild type (1), W160A (2), V210A (3), V210G (4), V210N (5), V210S (6), K288A (7), R325A (8), K360A (9), and W543A (10).

The data (Table II) show that removal of the residues that neutralize the negative charge of the uronic acid caused a substantial reduction in the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. The individual kinetic parameters of R325A could not be determined as there was a linear relationship between catalytic rate and the concentration of substrate up to 15 mm. The catalytic efficiency of R325A, however, was ∼106-fold less active than the wild-type enzyme. Substitution of the two lysine residues with alanine resulted in an increase in KM but a very large reduction in kcat. The catalytic efficiency of K288A and K360A were 30- and 200-fold higher, respectively than the arginine mutant.Table IICatalytic activity of mutants of GlcA67AEnzymekcatKMkcat/KMRelative kcat/KMakcat/KM is relative to wild type GlcA67A, which is defined as 1s-1mms-1mm-1Wild type143 ± 1.10.21 ± 0.036671W160A0.09 ± 0.0082.1 ± 0.34.3 × 10-26.4 × 10-5V210A220 ± 240.86 ± 0.112563.8 × 10-1V210G127 ± 120.19 ± 0.036681V210NNDbND, individual kinetic parameters could not be determined due to a very high KMND639.4 × 10-2V210SNDND294.3 × 10-2K288A0.014 ± 0.0010.69 ± 0.072.0 × 10-23.0 × 10-5R325ANDND6.39 × 10-49.6 × 10-7K360A0.20 ± 0.011.6 ± 0.21.3 × 10-11.9 × 10-4W543A0.38 ± 0.020.82 ± 0.184.6 × 10-16.9 × 10-4a kcat/KM is relative to wild type GlcA67A, which is defined as 1b ND, individual kinetic parameters could not be determined due to a very high KM Open table in a new tab The observation that R325A displayed considerably lower activity than the two lysine mutants is consistent with the location of the guanidinium group of Arg-325, which is ideally positioned to form strong hydrogen bonds with both oxygens of the carboxyl group of 4-O-MeGlcA. It is interesting to note that although the R325A mutant retains the capacity to form two hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl group of the substrate, through Lys-288 and Lys-360, the loss of the guanidino group has a profound effect on the capacity of the enzyme to bind the uronic acid. This is consistent with the geometry of a carboxylate and a guanidino moiety that are highly complementary, and thus the direction and co-operativity of the H-bonds leads to a very tight interaction between these two functional groups, as has been witnessed many times previously (19Wigley D.B. Lyall A. Hart K.W. Holbrook J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 927-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the electrostatic interaction of the carboxylate with the guanidino group is likely to be stronger than with the ϵ-NZ moiety of lysine as the solution pKa values of arginine and lysine are 12.5 and 10.8, respectively (20Stryer L. Biochemistry. 5th Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York2002: 50Google Scholar). Whereas both lysine residues interact with the carboxylate moiety of 4-O-MeGlcA, Lys-288 also forms an H-bond with the C-4 oxygen o"

The HIV-1 RT has been successfully exploited as a target for anti-human immunodeficiency virus therapy. However, monotherapy with antiviral agents has led to the rapid emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants. Combination regimens are currently used to delay the emergence of drug-resistant viruses. Unfortunately, not all patients tolerate combination regimens well, and this leads to a lack of compliance. These issues have fueled the continuing search for compounds that maintain potency against drug-resistant viruses and are better tolerated by patients. Amdoxovir ((–)-β-d-2,6-diaminopurine dioxolane) (Fig. 1) is currently in phase I/II clinical development for the treatment of HIV-1. This compound was designed as a pro-drug to enhance the oral bioavailability of the active compound, (–)-β-d-dioxolane guanosine (Fig. 1, DXG).

This lack of cross-resistance makes amdoxovir a potential therapeutic agent for patients who have failed the currently available therapies. The primary mutations that confer resistance to DXG are K65R and L74V in the HIV-1 RT (2Mewshaw J.P. Myrick F.T. Wakefield D.A. Hooper B.J. Harris J.L. McCreedy B. Borroto-Esoda K.

The K65R and L74V variants of HIV-1, constructed by site-specific mutagenesis of HIV-1LAI, showed a 5.6- and 3.5-fold increase in EC50 to DXG, respectively, as compared with wild-type (WT) HIV-1 (Table I). Additionally, the K65R mutation conferred partial to complete cross-resistance to 3TC, ddC, ddI, and {9-[2-(phosphonylmethoxy)ethyl], adefovir} (4Bazmi H.Z. Hammond J.L. Cavalcanti S.C.H. Chu C.K.

Open table in a new tab Two other HIV-1 RT mutations of interest are Q151M and K103N. The Q151M mutation is involved in multiple dideoxynucleoside resistance (8Shirasaka T. Kavlick M.F. Ueno T. Gao W.Y. Kojima E. Alcaide M.L. Chokekijchai S. Roy B.M. Arnold E. Yarchoan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2398-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In vitro studies showed that recombinant viruses with the mutations Q151M or K65R/Q151M were 9.6- and >20-fold less sensitive to DXG (Table I). The K103N mutation is associated with resistance to non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (9Bacheler L.T. Drug Resistance Update. 1999; 2: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A clinical isolate of HIV that contains the K103N mutation was shown to be hypersensitive to DXG (2Mewshaw J.P. Myrick F.T. Wakefield D.A. Hooper B.J. Harris J.L. McCreedy B. Borroto-Esoda K. AIDS. 2002; 29: 11-20Google Scholar). Interestingly, K103N appears to partially reverse the resistance to DXG conferred by certain mutations (2Mewshaw J.P. Myrick F.T. Wakefield D.A. Hooper B.J. Harris J.L. McCreedy B. Borroto-Esoda K. AIDS. 2002; 29: 11-20Google Scholar). In order to further understand the molecular mechanism of DXG drug resistance and its lack of cross-resistance toward HIV-1 variants that were resistant to standard nucleoside therapy, we investigated the inhibition of DNA synthesis by DXG-TP and incorporation of DXG-MP by wild-type and mutant HIV-1 RTs. Two aspects were evaluated. First, under the steady state conditions, we studied the inhibition of HIV-1 RT-catalyzed DNA synthesis by DXG-TP, AZT-TP, and 3TC-TP to assess the overall enzymatic reaction. Second, we used a transient pre-steady state kinetic approach to examine the incorporation of DXG-MP by HIV-1 RTs, which revealed the individual steps involving the binding of DXG-TP and its chemical catalysis. Wild-type HIV-1 RT and a series of mutant enzymes were used in these studies. The mutant RTs employed in our study possessed either the single mutations (K65R, L74V, K103N, and Q151M) or combinations of these mutations (K65R/K103N, L74V/K103N, K65R/Q151M, K103N/Q151M, and K65R/K103N/Q151M). AZT-resistant RT (D67N/K70R/T251Y/K219Q) and 3TC-resistant RT (M184V) were also used in this study. For the steady state kinetic analysis, Km (the apparent substrate dissociation constant), Ki (the apparent inhibitor dissociation constant), and kcat (the catalytic constant) values were measured. For pre-steady state kinetic analysis, two kinetic parameters Kd (the dissociation constant, which reflects the binding affinity of dNTP to the enzyme-DNA complex) and kpol (the maximum rate of dNMP incorporation) were determined. These two complementary kinetic analyses provide us with the following: 1) a molecular basis for the lack of cross-resistance between the AZTR and 3TCR viruses with DXG; 2) detailed information on DXG-related drug resistance; and 3) a further understanding of the collective effects of multiple mutations. Reagents—The non-radiolabeled deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphates (dNTPs), radiolabeled dNTPs ([α-32P]dCTP, [α-32P]dGTP, and [α-32P]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol)), poly(rC)·oligo(dG)12–18, and poly(rA)· oligo(dT)12–18 template-primers were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Polyinosinic acid (poly(rI)) and oligodeoxycytidylic acid (oligo(dC)12) were purchased from Sigma and resuspended in a solution of 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 100 mm NaCl. The annealed poly(rI)· oligo(dC)12 template-primers were prepared by mixing the homopolymers at a ratio of 1 mg of poly(rI), 10 nmol of oligo(dC)12 and boiled for 2 min. The template-primer was allowed to cool to room temperature, aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C. PAGE-purified DNA primer (30-mer, 5′-GCC TCG CAG CCG TCC AAC CAA CTC AAC CTC-3′) and DNA template (45-mer, 3′-CGG AGC GTC GGC AGG TTG GTT GAG TTG GAG CTA GGT TAC GGC AGG-5′) were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). The RNA template (45-mer, 3′-CGG AGC GUC GGC AGG UUG GUU GAG UUG GAG CUA GGU UAC GGC AGG-5′) was synthesized and gel-purified by New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The concentration of the oligonucleotides were estimated by UV absorbance at 260 nm using the following calculated extinction coefficients: DNA 30-mer, ϵ = 294,000 m–1 cm–1; DNA 45-mer, ϵ = 492,000 m–1 cm–1, and RNA 45-mer, ϵ = 508,000 m–1 cm–1. 5′-32P labeling of DNA 30-mer and annealing of DNA/DNA primer-template 30/45-mer (D30/D45) and DNA/RNA primer-template 30/45-mer were conducted as reported previously (10Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All other buffers and reagents were of analytical grade. Nucleotide Analogs—DXG was synthesized using published procedures (11Kim H.O. Schinazi R.F. Shanmuganathan K. Jeong L.S. Beach J.W. Nampalli S. Cannon D.L. Chu C.K. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The 5′-triphosphate of DXG (DXG-TP) was synthesized by Inspire Pharmaceuticals (Durham, NC). 3′-Azido-3′-deoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate (AZT-TP) and (–)-β-l-2′,3′-dideoxy-3′thiacytidine 5′-triphosphate (3TC-TP) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The plasmid, p6HRT-PROT (12Boyer P.L. Tantillo C. Jacobo-Molina A. Nanni R.G. Ding J.-P. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4882-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which contains the 66-kDa coding region for HIV-1 RT and the HIV-1 protease coding region was obtained from Dr. Stephen Hughes at the National Institutes of Health. The plasmid was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's instruction (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The entire RT coding region of each mutated plasmid was analyzed by dideoxy sequencing to confirm the accuracy of the sequence. Purified HIV-1 RT harboring either the M184V mutation (3TCR RT) or a combination of D67N/K70R/T215Y/K219Q RT mutations (AZTR RT) was purified at Dr. K. S. Anderson's laboratory at Yale University (New Haven, CT). Enzyme Expression and Purification—The wild-type and mutant HIV-1 RT proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (13Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 36: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 14Kerr S.G. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14056-14063Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient (ϵ280) of 260,450 m–1 cm–1. The concentration of active RT in each preparation was determined by pre-steady state burst kinetics that yielded the active site concentration (30–40% of enzyme concentration). The active site concentrations were used to calculate the kcat values reported in this study. Steady State Kinetic Analysis—The steady state constants were measured using initial rates. Reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.025% Triton X-100, 0.012 units of homopolymeric RNA/DNA template-primer, 1 μCi of [α-32P]dNTP, and varying dNTP concentrations in a final volume of 50 μl. All reactions were carried out at 37 °C and initiated by the addition of enzyme. Aliquots of the reaction were collected at five time points ranging from 0.5 to 5 min in the linear phase of the reaction. Aliquots (5 μl) were spotted on DE81 ion-exchange paper and allowed to dry. The DE81 paper was washed with 50 mg/ml Na2HPO4 (3 times, 5 min/wash) and ethanol (reagent grade, 2 min) and dried. Product quantification was performed using a Amersham Biosciences Phosphor-Imager. The Km and Vmax values were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation through non-linear regression using Grafit (version 3.09b, Erithacus software, UK). Values reported are means ± S.E. Enzyme reaction mixtures used to measure the inhibition of dNMP incorporation into the homopolymeric RNA/DNA template-primer by a dideoxynucleoside analog 5′-triphosphate (ddNTP) were similar to the steady state reaction mixtures described above, except that the dNTP substrate concentration was fixed, and the concentration of ddNTP was varied. IC50 values were obtained by fitting the inhibition data to the following Equation 1 by using nonlinear least squares regression, % inhibition=a/(1+([ddNTP]/IC50(ddNTP))s)Eq. 1 where a is the maximum percent inhibition at a saturating concentration of ddNTP; [ddNTP] is the concentration of the nucleoside analog 5′-triphosphate, and s is the slope factor. The Ki value was calculated from the measured IC50(ddNTP) value using Equation 2, Ki(ddNTP)=IC50(ddNTP)/(1+[S]/Km(dNTP))Eq. 2 where IC50(ddNTP) is the value calculated from the inhibition experiment; [S] is the concentration of the natural dNTP, and Km(dNTP) is the apparent binding constant for the natural dNTP. Values reported are means ± S.E. Pre-steady State Kinetic Analysis—Transient kinetic experiments were performed by the rapid quench method as described previously using a KinTek Instrument Model RQF-3 rapid quench-flow apparatus (13Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 36: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 14Kerr S.G. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14056-14063Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Unless noted otherwise, all concentrations referred to the final concentration after mixing. Under pre-steady state burst conditions, the reactions were carried out by mixing a solution containing the preincubated complex of HIV-1 RT (100 nm) and 5′-32P-labeled D30/D45 primer-template duplex (300 nm) with a solution containing 10 mm MgCl2 and various concentrations of the dNTP. When single turnover conditions were used, the reactions were carried out by mixing a solution containing the preincubated complex of HIV-1 RT (200–250 nm) and 5′-32P-labeled D30/D45 duplex (50 nm) with a solution of 10 mm MgCl2 and various concentrations of the dNTP. The reactions were quenched with 0.3 m EDTA at time intervals ranging from 3 ms to 2 min. The products from each quench reaction were resolved by sequencing gel analysis (14% acrylamide, 8 m urea) followed by PhosphorImaging (Bio-Rad Personal Molecular Imager FX). Data were fitted by non-linear regression (KaleidaGraph 3.09). Under burst conditions, the product formation occurred in a fast exponential phase, followed by a slower linear phase. Data from burst experiments were fit to a burst Equation 3, [product]=A(1−exp(−kobst)+ksst)Eq. 3 where A represents the amplitude of the burst that correlates with the concentration of enzyme in the active form; kobs is the observed first-order rate constant for dNMP incorporation; kss is the observed steady state rate constant, and t is the reaction time. Data from single turnover experiments were fit to a single exponential Equation 4, [product]=A(1−exp(−kobst))Eq. 4 where kobs is the observed first-order rate constant for the incorporation of dNMP, and t is the reaction time. The dissociation constant (Kd) for dNTP binding to the enzyme-DNA complex was calculated by fitting the data to the hyperbolic Equation 5, kobs=(kpol×[dNTP])/(Kd+[dNTP])Eq. 5 where the kpol is the maximum rate of dNMP incorporation, and [dNTP] is the corresponding concentration of dNTP. Substrate Analysis for HIV-1 RT Variants—The incorporation of natural dNTP substrates by mutant and WT HIV-1 RTs was measured using homopolymeric RNA/DNA template-primers. The steady state kinetic parameters, Km and kcat, determined for dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP are summarized in Table II. In general, the Km and kcat values obtained for the mutant RTs were not significantly different from the WT enzyme.Table IISteady-state kinetic parameters for dNMP incorporation into homopolymeric template-primers by mutant HIV-1 RTsThe template-primers used are poly(rI)·oligo(dC)12, poly(rC)·oligo(dG)12-18, and poly(rA)·oligo(dT)12-18 for dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, respectively.HIV RTKmkcatkcat/KmdCTPdGTPdTTPdCTPdGTPdTTPdCTPdGTPdTTPμMmin-1min-1 μM-1WT0.50 ± 0.09aValues are mean ± S.E.1.14 ± 0.254.72 ± 0.8319.6 ± 2.812.7 ± 1.1156 ± 2539.211.233.1K65R1.10 ± 0.251.49 ± 0.273.06 ± 0.8715.5 ± 5.414.1 ± 2.057 ± 1314.19.518.7L74V0.45 ± 0.061.34 ± 0.252.73 ± 0.4020.2 ± 4.618.7 ± 1.672 ± 1745.314.026.5K103N0.50 ± 0.090.82 ± 0.102.18 ± 0.5231.9 ± 5.917.8 ± 5.0114 ± 2863.421.752.5Q151M0.73 ± 0.260.40 ± 0.185.78 ± 0.9413.6 ± 1.714.7 ± 4.5166 ± 4518.637.028.7K65R/K103N1.28 ± 0.230.96 ± 0.143.33 ± 0.9030.4 ± 3.638.7 ± 4.5203 ± 3923.740.561.1L74V/K103N0.21 ± 0.010.30 ± 0.012.40 ± 0.3312.6 ± 2.211.6 ± 1.8121 ± 1258.738.950.5Q151M/K103N0.75 ± 0.160.55 ± 0.083.88 ± 0.928.7 ± 0.913.1 ± 0.8162 ± 2611.623.941.8K65R/Q151M0.95 ± 0.071.18 ± 0.344.40 ± 1.2212.9 ± 1.423.1 ± 6.5147 ± 4713.619.533.3K65R/K103N/Q151M1.49 ± 0.270.65 ± 0.154.39 ± 0.9918.6 ± 3.522.9 ± 6.5197 ± 4312.435.344.9AZTRbAZTR, D67N/K70R/T215Y/K219Q.0.86 ± 0.161.68 ± 0.616.00 ± 1.1819.9 ± 3.516.5 ± 4.3117 ± 2523.19.819.53TCRc3TCR, M184V.0.73 ± 0.201.14 ± 0.394.70 ± 0.7115.0 ± 0.523.5 ± 4.8123 ± 2120.620.626.2a Values are mean ± S.E.b AZTR, D67N/K70R/T215Y/K219Q.c 3TCR, M184V.

Open table in a new tab Inhibition of dGMP Incorporation by DXG-TP—Inhibition of dGMP incorporation into poly(rC)·oligo(dG)12–18 by DXG-TP was not affected by the following mutations: K65R, L74V, K103N, K65R/K103N, L74V/K103N, and K103N/Q151M, nor were AZT-resistant (AZTR) or 3TC-resistant (3TCR) RTs. However, the Ki/Km ratio for the Q151M, K65R/Q151M, and K65R/K103N/Q151M mutant RTs were increased by 5.3-, 15-, and 7.8-fold, respectively, over the wild-type enzyme, indicating that these mutant enzymes were less sensitive to the inhibition of dGMP incorporation by DXG-TP than the WT enzyme. Recently, Mewshaw et al. (2Mewshaw J.P. Myrick F.T. Wakefield D.A. Hooper B.J. Harris J.L. McCreedy B. Borroto-Esoda K. AIDS. 2002; 29: 11-20Google Scholar) reported a possible re-sensitization effect of K103N mutation on the antiviral activity of DXG against clinical isolates of HIV-1. In this study, the presence of the K103N mutation in a background of K65R, Q151M, or K65R/Q151M caused a re-sensitization effect over the corresponding non-K103N-containing mutants. Compared with the K65R, Q151M, or K65R/Q151M RTs, the Ki/Km ratios were reduced by 2.2-, 3.7-, and 1.9-fold (p values < 0.1) when the K103N mutation was introduced. Inhibition of dTMP Incorporation by AZT-TP—Inhibition of dTMP incorporation into poly(rA)·oligo(dT)12–18 by AZT-TP was studied. The Ki value for the inhibition of dTMP incorporation by AZT-TP for AZTR (D67N/K70R/T215Y/K219Q) RT was similar to WT enzyme. For the mutant RTs with L74V, K103N, L74V/K103N, and M184V, there was no increase in the Ki/Km ratio for the inhibition of dTMP incorporation by AZT-TP. Enzymes containing the K65R, Q151M, and K65R/Q151M mutations, however, did show significant resistance to AZT-TP inhibition, with fold changes of 6.4, 6.7, and 55, respectively. The K103N containing mutations K65R/K103N, K103N/Q151M, and K65R/K103N/Q151M caused 3.7-, 2.7-, and 18-fold increases for Ki/Km ratio over WT RT. Again, the addition of the K103N mutation to K65R, Q151M, or K65R/Q151M RT mutants resulted in a moderate decrease in resistance to AZT-TP inhibition, with a 1.7- (K65R/K103N), 2.5- (K103N/Q151M), and 3.1-fold (K65R/K103N/Q151M) decrease in the Ki/Km ratio for AZT-TP. Inhibition of dCMP Incorporation by 3TC-TP—Inhibition of dCMP incorporation into poly(rI)·oligo(dC)12 by 3TC-TP was only marginally (0.5–2-fold change) affected by most of the mutations, with the exception of M184V. Similar to data reported previously (15Faraj A. Agrofoglio L.A. Wakefield J.K. McPherson S. Marrow C.D. Gosselin G. Mathe C. Imbach J.-L. Schinazi R.F. Sommadossi J.-P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2300-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the M184V mutation caused an ∼300-fold increase in the Ki/Km ratio (Table III). DNA-dependent Incorporation of dGMP by Wild-type and Mutant HIV-1 RTs—Our first step in defining the kinetics for the incorporation of natural substrate dGTP was to conduct a pre-steady state burst experiment with WT and mutant HIV-1 RTs. In this experiment, the DNA substrate was in excess of the enzyme such that the first enzyme turnover as well as multiple turnovers can be examined. Our previous studies (1Furman P.A. Jeffery J.

This is an important diagnostic experiment indicating that a slow step that follows the chemistry limits the overall reaction pathway (13Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 36: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). To establish that the mechanistic pathway was not changed with the mutant HIV-1 RTs, we studied the mutant enzymes in pre-steady state burst experiments as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For all enzymes, a biphasic burst of product formation was observed. A representative time course for the incorporation of dGTP (10 μm) into the D30/D45 primer-template by WT or AZTR RT is shown in Fig. 2. A complete study of the dGTP concentration dependence on the observed burst rate of incorporation provided measurements for the dissociation constant (Kd), the maximum rate of dGMP incorporation (kpol), and the efficiency of incorporation (kpol/Kd). Fig. 3 shows the dGTP concentration dependence of kobs for incorporation into the D30/D45 primer-template using WT and AZTR HIV-1 RT. The kpol value for dGMP incorporation by AZTR RT (18.3 ± 0.9 s–1) is very similar to that of WT RT (15.9 ± 0.5 s–1). The Kd value for the AZTR RT (4.8 ± 0.8 μm) also is similar to that of WT RT (6.1 ± 0.9 μm), indicating dGTP binds to the (AZTR-RT)-DNA complex as tightly as it binds to the (WT RT)-DNA complex. As a result, dGTP is incorporated by AZTR-RT as efficiently as the WT enzyme, as indicated by the kpol/Kd value (Table IV).Table IVKinetic differences between wild-type and mutant HIV-1 RTs in DNA-dependent incorporation of dGMP or DXG-MPHIV-1 RTdGTPDXG-TPSelectivity factoraDefined as (kpol/Kd)dGTP/(kpol/ Kd)DXG-TP.Fold changesbDefined as (selectivity factor)mutantRT/(selectivity factor)WT RT.kpolKdkpol/KdkpolKdkpol/Kds-1μMμM-1 s-1s-1μMμM-1 s-1WT15.9 ± 0.5cValues are mean ± S.E.

https://openalex.org/W2085600937,"The structural maintenance of chromosome protein SMC3 is a component of the cohesin complex that mediates sister chromatid cohesion and segregation in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is also present extracellularly in the form of a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan known as bamacan. We have found previously that SMC3 expression is elevated in a large fraction of human colon carcinomas. The additional finding that the protein is significantly increased in the intestinal polyps of ApcMin/+ mice has led us to hypothesize that SMC3 expression is linked to activation of the APC/β-catenin/TCF4 pathway. The immunohistochemical analysis of colon adenocarcinomas from clinical specimens revealed that β-catenin and SMC3 antigens co-localize with maximal stain intensity within the transformed areas. Cloning and sequencing of 1578 bp of the human SMC3 promoter unveiled the presence of seven putative consensus sequences for β-catenin/TCF4 binding, two of which are conserved in the mouse Smc3 promoter. Transient transfection experiments in HCT116 and SW480 human colon carcinoma cells using deletion and mutated promoter constructs in luciferase reporter vectors confirmed that the putative sites, the first located at -48 bp and the second located at -701 bp, are susceptible to β-catenin/TCF4 transactivation. Co-transfection with a β-catenin expression vector enhanced the promoter activity whereas E-cadherin had the opposite effect. Binding of β-catenin/TCF4 complexes from SW480 nuclear extracts to these sequences was confirmed by electrophoretic shift and supershift mobility assays. Altogether these results are consistent with the idea that the β-catenin/TCF4 transactivation pathway contributes to SMC3 overexpression in intestinal tumorigenesis.

Mutations in the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene are found in more than 70% of human intestinal adenomas (1Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4264) Google Scholar). APC is regarded as the gatekeeper of the tumorigenesis process in the intestine, because the mutation and the loss of heterozygosity of APC occurs as the earliest event in hereditary and sporadic adenocarcinoma (1Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4264) Google Scholar). The key role of APC in tumorigenesis has been attributed to its function in targeting β-catenin for degradation (2Munemitsu S. Albert I. Suoza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). The finding that β-catenin accumulates throughout the cell in the intestinal adenomas and that ectopic expression of APC in colon tumor cells lowers its level and inhibits tumor growth points to a link among APC mutation, β-catenin cytoplasmic level, and colon carcinoma (2Munemitsu S.

Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3488) Google Scholar). Further evidence for a key role of β-catenin in intestinal tumorigenesis has been provided by the findings that mutation in β-catenin glycogen synthase kinase 3β-dependent phosphorylation sites makes it resistant to proteolytic degradation, giving rise to a phenotype that is indistinguishable from that of APC null mutations (5Rubinfeld B.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16641-16645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Additionally, half of the sporadic colorectal cancer cells with wild-type APC have mutated β-catenin (4Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3488) Google Scholar). β-Catenin acts as a transcriptional cofactor by migrating to the nucleus and associating with members of a family of DNA-binding proteins known as T cell factors, of which TCF4 is expressed in the intestinal epithelium (7Behrens J. von Kriess J.P.

The targets of β-catenin/TCF4 transactivation include development-related genes activated through the Wingless/Wnt signaling pathway (9Willert K. Nusse R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). More recently, a number of genes relevant for colorectal tumor formation and progression have been identified as being transcriptionally activated by the β-catenin/TCF4 complex. Some are relevant for growth control and cell cycling (c-Myc, cyclin D1, c-Jun, fra-1, gastrin, ITF2), some are implicated in cell survival (Id2, and MDR1), and some are implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis (matrilysin, VEGF) (10Rockman S.P.

SMC3 (formerly called Bamacan, Cspg6, HCAP, SmcD, or Mmip1) is a member of the multimeric cohesin complex that plays a key role in establishing chromatids cohesion and is also involved in chromosomal DNA repair (20Lee J.Y. Orr-Weaver L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 753-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 21Darwiche N. Freeman L.A. Strunnikov A.

Cohesins associates with the AT-rich sequences of chromosomal DNA near the centromeres and also along the arms with a periodicity of 9 to 15 kb. At the onset of anaphase, the complex is cleaved by the cysteine protease separin allowing chromosomal segregation (23Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Interference with this process generates chromosomal instability (24Jallepalli P.V. Waizenegger V.C. Bunz F. Langer S. Speicher M.R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Lengauer C. Cell. 2001; 18: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A post-translationally modified form of SMC3 carries chondroitin sulfate chains and is secreted as a proteoglycan known as bamacan (25Wu R.R. Couchman J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have reported previously (26Ghiselli G. Iozzo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20235-20238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that SMC3 mRNA level is elevated in about 70% of tumors from patients with colon carcinoma and that Smc3 protein is specifically increased in the intestinal polyps of ApcMin/+ mice in which loss of heterozygosity of the Apc gene causes a large increase of intracellular β-catenin (27Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar). In addition, NIH-3T3 and BALB/c 3T3 murine fibroblasts stably transfected with Smc3 display a transformed phenotype, suggesting that this protein is involved in tumorigenesis (26Ghiselli G. Iozzo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20235-20238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These findings have led us to hypothesize that SMC3 overexpression in intestinal carcinoma is linked to β-catenin/TCF4 transcriptional activation and that its subsequent overexpression is a relevant pathogenetic event. In this paper we provide evidence in support of this hypothesis. Both the human and the mouse SMC3 promoters contain several conserved β-catenin/TCF4 binding consensus sequences that are responsible for the transactivation of the gene. We found that SMC3 promoter transcriptional activity is increased by elevated β-catenin levels and suppressed by a lowered β-catenin level. Immunohistochemical analysis of β-catenin and SMC3 in serial sections of colon from patients with invasive adenocarcinoma and of the intestinal adenomas from ApcMin/+ mice revealed that the two antigens co-localize with maximal stain intensity at the tumoral sites. The results are consistent with the idea that SMC3 is a target for the β-catenin/TCF4 transactivation pathway. Materials—Goat anti-human SMC3 and goat anti-human SMC1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-human β-catenin and anti-β-integrin monoclonal antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences. Immunohistochemistry kits were from DAKO (Carpenteria, CA) and Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Tri-Reagent, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG antibodies, and anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody were purchased from Sigma. The West-Dura Supersignal ECL 1The abbreviations used are: ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; RT, reverse-transcriptase; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein. detection system, the NE-PER nuclear-cytoplasmic extraction kit, and the bicinchoninic acid-based protein assay kit were from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Heat inactivated fetal calf serum and cell medium were purchased from Mediatech (Herndon, VA). BioMax x-ray films were from Eastman Kodak Co. (Rochester, NY). [γ-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP were from ICN Biochemical (Irvine, CA). The λgt11 HeLa genomic library was from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Turbo-Pfu polymerase was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The DNA restriction and modifying enzymes, pGL3-Firefly luciferase empty vector, phRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase reporter vector, the Dual luciferase assay kit, and the Tfx cell transfection agent were from Promega (Madison, WI). Quick-spin oligo columns and proteinase inhibitors were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The reverse-transcriptase reagents were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The PCR reagents were from Takara (Madison, WI). All the chemicals were of ACS or biological purity and were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. Immunohistochemistry and in Situ Hybridization Analysis—Polyps and normal tissue from the intestines of seven 6-month-old ApcMin/+ mice were dissected under a stereo microscope, fixed in 3.7% buffered formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Archival paraffin blocks of tumoral and matched normal colon tissue from 10 patients that had undergone surgery for colon carcinoma were obtained from the Surgical Pathology service of the Jefferson Hospital. For the immunohistochemistry, serial tumor and normal tissue sections of 5 μm were subjected to antigen retrieval by microwaving in 0.1 m citrate solution, pH 6.0, for 10 min, and the immunostaining was performed on a Biogenex Optimax Autostainer. Sections were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either monoclonal β-catenin antibody (1:1000 to 1:5000) or goat anti-human SMC3 antibody (1:100 to 1:800). SMC3 and β-catenin immunocomplexes were visualized in the clinical specimens using Vecstatin ABC kits and a multilink horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Mouse Smc3 was detected using a biotinylated rabbit anti-goat antibody, whereas β-catenin was detected using a DAKO ARK kit designed for the immunohistochemical staining with mouse primary antibodies of mouse tissue sections. Mouse and human stained specimens were examined under a light microscope. For the statistical analysis of the results we tested the hypothesis of coincidence of staining. Adenocarcinoma and normal specimens from the same subject were analyzed separately. We computed a 95% lower confidence bound (one-sided confidence interval) based on the exact binomial distribution for the proportion of samples for which the SMC3 result was coincident with the β-catenin result (28Conover W.J. Practical Nonparametric Statistics. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1980Google Scholar). The lower confidence bound gives us a value that we can be 95% confident is exceeded by the actual coincidence rate. Cell Cultures—Human skin fibroblasts, human colon carcinomas HCT116 and SW480, and HeLa cell lines were obtained from ATCC (CRL-2522, CRL-247, CRL-228, and CCL-2, respectively). Cell cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2. Cells were subcultured by trypsinization when they had reached ∼80% confluence. Primer 5′-Extension—Total RNA was extracted from confluent human skin fibroblasts, HCT116, and HeLa cells using Tri-Reagent, and ethanol was precipitated and dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm Na2EDTA. The oligonucleotide 5′-AAGGAGACCTGCCCCGGAGCAGCA-3′, complementary to a region flanking the 3′-side of the translational start site of the human SMC3 gene, was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4-polynucleotide kinase. After purification on Quick-spin columns, 1 pmol of 32P probe was hybridized with 2 μg of total RNA in 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, at 58 °C for 20 min. Reverse transcription was initiated by addition of 20 units of Superscript reverse-transcriptase. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The extension product was analyzed on a sequencing 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea, and the bands were evidenced by autoradiography. Isolation and Identification of the Human SMC3 Promoter—dEST clones matching the human SMC3 cDNA sequence at its 5′-end were identified by blasting the dEST data base with the published cDNA sequence of the gene (GenBank™ accession number NP-005436). Identified clones were purchased from ATCC and used as PCR templates. A 202-bp 32P-labeled probe spanning the putative 5′-untranslated region of human SMC3 was used for screening of a HeLa genomic λgt11 phage library. Briefly, after titration, 106 plaque-forming units of bacteriophages were plated at a density of 500 plaque-forming units per cm2 in 15-cm dishes. Positive clones were identified by colony lifting on nitrocellulose membranes followed by hybridization with 32P-labeled probes at 65 °C in Denhardt's-saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA buffer. Positive plaques were isolated and plated at a lower plaque-forming unit density for a second round of screening. Colonies that remain positive after the quaternary screening were expanded, and the packaged human genomic DNA was characterized by digestion with a panel of restriction enzymes. DNA fragments hybridizing with the 32P probes were subcloned in pBS-KS and sequenced at the SP6 or T7 end to confirm their identity. A 2.1-kb clone was found to span the translational start site of SMC3 at its 3′-end. The sequence of the amplified fragment matched that of human clone Hs10–24204 (Human Genome Sequencing Project) on chromosome 10 and corresponded to the 5′-flanking region of the SMC3 gene. The cloning, sequencing, and partial functional characterization of the murine Smc3 promoter have been reported previously (29Ghiselli G. Siracusa L.D. Iozzo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17384-17393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Generation of Promoter Reporter Vectors and of Deletion Constructs—A 1.6-kb insert (SMC3(-1578/+56)) corresponding to the SMC3 promoter freed of the λgt11 phage staffing sequences was generated by PCR from the pBS-KS clone using Taq polymerase and primers of sequence 5′-AGCTCTACAAAAACAAAAAAAAGCTC-3′ and 5′-AAGGAGACCTGCCCCGGAGCAGCA-3′, respectively. The SMC3(-438/+56) insert spanning the 3′-end of the SMC3 promoter was likewise generated by PCR using a forward primer of sequence 5′-GGCTAGCACAGTGCGCGCGAGGTC-3′. SMC3(-1578/-273) was generated using the reverse primer 5′-GTCCGTACCACCTCCGAGCGCGGG-3′. These inserts were cloned in pGL3 basic vector by standard molecular biology techniques. pGL3-SMC3(-207/+56) was generated by taking advantage of a unique EcoRI restriction site at position -206 of the promoter sequence and by digesting pGL3-SMC3(-438/+56) with XhoI and EcoRI followed by relegation. The putative β-catenin binding site TTTTGTT contained in the SMC3-207/+56 was mutated to TCCTGTT by taking advantage of a unique BbvCI restriction site at position -41 of the promoter. The mutated insert was generated by PCR using the reverse primer 5′-CCCCTCAGCCAAACAGGATGGCGGCGCTCGT-3′ and the forward primer extending from base -438. The insert was then digested with EcoRI and BbvCI and ligated at the same restriction sites in pGL3-SMC3(-438/+56). The new construct was cleaved at XhoI and EcoRI and relegated to yield MT-pGL3-SMC3(-207/+56). Wild-type human β-catenin cloned in pcDNA3 was the kind gift of Dr. Byers (George Washington University, Washington, D. C.). Mouse E-cadherin cloned in pBSII-SK was a gift from Dr. Takeuchi (Kochi Medical School). The E-cadherin coding sequence was retrieved by digestion with XbaI and KpnI and inserted at the same sites in pcDNA3.1. The expression vector (pHR-hTCF4) harboring the wild-type human TCF4 gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter was a generous gift from Dr. Kinzler (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Activity Assay—Cells cultures at 70% confluence in 12-well plates were used in all the experiments. The transfection mix contained 100 ng/ml of phRL-SV40 plasmid to correct for transfection efficiency and 1 μg/ml of the designed plasmids. Plasmids were mixed in medium 199, followed by the addition of 36 μg/μg DNA of Tfx-50 transfection agent according to the manufacturer's directions. Mixtures were incubated for 15 min at room temperature prior to addition to the cultures. Three hundred μl of the transfection mix was added to each plate well. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C in a humidified incubator, the cells were supplemented with 1 ml of growth medium. Twenty-four h later the cell medium was discarded, and the cultures were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After cell solubilization in 200 μl of lysis buffer, a 20-μl aliquot was assayed using a dual-luciferase kit. Sample luminescence was read on a Zylux Sirius luminometer (Oak Ridge, TN). Firefly luciferase activity readings were corrected for transfection efficiency using the Renilla luciferase readings. All experiments were carried out with triplicate samples. The statistical differences between groups of data were analyzed by Student's t test. Western Immunoblotting and Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—For immunoblotting, cells were collected in 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, lysis buffer supplemented with 50 μg/ml antipain, 40 μg/ml bestatin, 5 μg/ml E-64, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na2EDTA. The cell lysate protein (50 μg) was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE slab gel. Separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose by electroblotting, and the filters were blocked in 5% dry milk followed by incubation for 1 h with goat anti-human SMC3 (1:1000). After washing, the filters were incubated with an anti-goat IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (1:10,000) secondary antibody, and the immunocomplexes were identified using a West-Dura ECL kit followed by autoradiography. To confirm that equal amount of proteins had been loaded and to examine β-catenin levels, the immunocomplexes were stripped by incubating the membranes in 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, at 56 °C for 30 min. After blocking in 5% dry milk, the filters were cut at the 90-kDa molecular mass standard mark, and the bottom section was incubated with anti-human α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:1000). The top portion of the filter was instead incubated with anti-human β-catenin monoclonal antibody (1:2000). After reaction with anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000), the immunocomplexes were detected by ECL followed by autoradiography and densitometric scanning. SMC3 and SMC1 transcript levels were assessed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. For this purpose, the transfected cells were extracted in Tri-Reagent, and 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Qiagen Sensiscript kit and oligo(dT) primers. PCR cycling was stopped after completion of 20 and 30 cycles to ensure that products were quantitated during the non-saturating phase of the reaction. SMC3 and SMC1 cDNA levels were assessed by agarose electrophoresis. Gels were photographed, and the propidinium iodine stained bands were quantitated by densitometric scanning. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The cell nuclear extracts were prepared using the NE-PER extraction kit. Before use, the nuclear extracts were dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 75 mm KCl, 0.1% Na2EDTA, and protein content was assayed. The following oligonucleotides and their antisense were synthesized: 5′-CGCCGCCATTTTGTTTGGC-3′, corresponding to the -57/-39- and -56/-37-bp regions of the human and the mouse promoters, respectively, and 5′-TAAATCTTTGTTGCAATTGT-3′, corresponding to the -706/-687-bp region of the human promoter. One μg of the sense and the complementary oligonucleotide were combined in 50 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and annealed by incubation at 90 °C for 3 min and by cooling to 25 °C at a 1 °C/min rate. Double stranded oligos were end-labeled with T4-polynucleotide kinase using 50 μCi of [γ-32P]dATP and purified by chromatography through a Quick-spin oligo column. An aliquot (15,000 cpm) was incubated with 5 μg of cell nuclear extract in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 75 mm KCl, 0.1% Na2EDTA containing 0.5 μg poly(dI·dC) in a 50 μl final volume for 10 min at room temperature. For the supershift assay, 0.5 μg of antibody were added to the incubation mixture. DNA-protein hybrids were analyzed on a 6% non-denaturating polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 39:1) in 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine buffer, and the bands were visualized by autoradiography. Tissue Localization of SMC3 and β-Catenin in Adenomatous Polyps—The expression of SMC3 in human adenomatous polyps was examined by immunohistochemistry in tumoral and in matched normal tissues from 10 patients that had undergone surgery for colon carcinoma (Fig. 1, A-I). Serial sections were stained with monoclonal anti β-catenin and polyclonal anti-SMC3 antibody to assess the degree of co-localization of the two antigens. In normal tissue, β-catenin was detected at the cell-cell interface. On the contrary, adenoma and adenocarcinoma cells had diffuse β-catenin staining suggestive of an increase of the cytoplasmic antigen level. Adenomatous areas that displayed intense staining for β-catenin also had enhanced anti-SMC3 antibody reactivity. Neither β-catenin nor SMC3 were found at high levels in the surrounding normal tissue. This finding was invariably observed in all the specimens examined. As for β-catenin, the strongest staining for SMC3 was detected intracellularly. Incubation of the tissue sections with a blocking peptide of sequence corresponding to the epitope recognized by the SMC3 antibody effectively neutralized the tissue immunoreactivity. Furthermore, no immunoreactivity was observed by incubation with the secondary antibody alone. With all the specimens displaying an identical SMC3 and β-catenin distribution pattern, the positivity rate, i.e. the proportion of samples displaying identical β-catenin and SMC3 staining pattern, was 100% (10/10) with a 95% confidence bound of 74.1%. These results are in line with our previous results (26Ghiselli G. Iozzo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20235-20238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) showing a statistically significant higher expression of SMC3 in the tumoral colon specimens compared with matched normal tissues. Mouse intestinal sections displayed the same pattern of staining as the human tissues. In particular, the greater β-catenin staining intensity in the transformed areas was matched by that of Smc3 (Fig. 1, J and K). Polyps from the intestine of seven mice were examined. Given the coincidence of SMC3 and β-catenin staining in the mouse samples examined, the positivity rate had a 95% confidence bound of 65.3%. Structure of the Human SMC3 Promoter—The transcription start site was determined by primer extension (Fig. 2A) and by comparison of the published sequences of dEST cDNAs. Based on our calculations, the site would be located 76 bp upstream of the translational start site. The size of the human gene 5′-untranslated region is therefore similar to that identified previously for the mouse Smc3 gene and calculated to be 95 bp in size. The mouse and human promoter sequences were examined for the presence of conserved putative transcriptional binding sites utilizing the TFSEARCH data base of published recognition sequences. As in the murine gene, a TATA box was also absent in the human sequence (see Fig. 2B). Both promoters, however, had a conserved region of sequence 5′-GCCGCCATTTTGTTTGGC-3′ beginning at -56 in the human gene and -55 in the murine gene. In addition to this highly conserved sequence, a series of putative transcriptional factor binding sites were identified whose location was conserved in the human and mouse SMC3 promoters (Fig. 2C). A binding sequence for the tumor suppressor MZF1 is located within the initial 40 bp flanking the transcriptional start site. Recognition sites for the ubiquitously expressed Sp1 transcriptional factor are situated in the -20- to -250-bp region. Binding sites for c-Myc and E2F are found within the -270- to -380-bp range. Finally, a conserved binding site for the tumor suppressor Cdx is located in the -670-bp region and is flanked by a CREB-P binding sequence in the -700-bp neighborhood. This region also harbors one of the two conserved β-catenin/TCF4 binding sites located at position -701 bp in the human promoter and at position -763 bp in the mouse sequence. The human binding site 5′-CTTTGTT-3′ is a perfect consensus sequence (30van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Dooijes D. Clevers H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), whereas the mouse binding site (5′-ATCAAG-3′) had sequence complementary to that identified in the human Id2 promoter (10Rockman S.P.

Despite many studies over the last 25 years, there has been no suggestion that TAG was a metalloprotein. However, here we establish by heteronuclear NMR and other spectroscopic methods that TAG binds 1 eq of Zn2+ extremely tightly. A family of refined NMR structures shows that 4 conserved residues contributed from the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of TAG (Cys4, His17, His175, and Cys179) form a Zn2+ binding site. The Zn2+ ion serves to tether the otherwise unstructured amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of TAG.

Excision repair of damaged bases in DNA is one pathway that cells use to protect the genome from the damaging effects of ionizing radiation, reactive oxygen species, and alkylating agents (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4377) Google Scholar). Lesion repair begins by enzymatic hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond, the critical initiating step of the DNA base excision repair pathway. There are many different types of DNA glycosylases in cells. In general, each DNA glycosylase exhibits specificity for a cognate damaged base while ignoring undamaged bases in DNA. One alkylated base, 3-methyladenine, is highly toxic, because DNA replication is blocked at this lesion site (2Boiteux S. Huisman O. Laval J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2569-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the glycosidic bond of 3-methyladenine is hydrolyzed by two enzymes, 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase I (TAG) 1The abbreviations used are: TAG, 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase I; HhH, helix-hairpin-helix; AAS, atomic absorption spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; r.m.s.d., root-mean-square deviation; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; NOES, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence. and II (AlkA) (3Wyatt M.D. Allan J.M. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T.E. Samson L.D. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It has been recently discovered that TAG is a member of the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) superfamily of DNA glycosylases (4Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The HhH motif is a sequence-nonspecific DNA binding module found in DNA polymerases, NAD+-dependent DNA ligases, and some DNA glycosylases (5Nash H.M. Bruner S.D. Scharer O.D. Kawate T. Addona T.A. Spooner E. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 968-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). This motif consists of two α-helices connected by a consensus hairpin loop that interacts nonspecifically with the DNA backbone. Unlike other HhH family members, TAG does not possess the consensus hairpin sequence, (L/F)PG(V/I)G, nor does it contain the conserved aspartate group that was previously believed to be required for catalysis as a water activating group or, alternatively, for stabilization of a transition state with glycosyl cation character. Thus, TAG appears to be unique with respect to structure and mechanism within this superfamily (4Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although it has been concluded previously that TAG does not require a metal ion for activity (6Riazuddin S. Lindahl T. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2110-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the possibility of a metal binding site was suggested by our recent NMR structure and a coincident bioinformatics study (4Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Bujnicki J.M. Rychlewski L. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). According to the solution structure, two conserved sulfur and histidine ligands at opposing ends of the linear sequence are closely positioned in three-dimensional space (Cys4, His17, His175, and Cys179) (4Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Bujnicki J.M. Rychlewski L. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), but given the limitations of the NMR method, the presence of a metal ion was not established. As shown in Fig. 1, the sequence alignment of the TAG family shows that these potential metal ligands are also completely conserved across all species. Taken together, these observations clearly suggested the presence of a metal ion binding site. Here we establish this hypothesis and present the structure of a long overlooked Zn2+ binding site in TAG. The metal site stabilizes the structure of TAG by “snap-ping” together the largely unstructured N- and C-terminal regions. This “zinc snap” motif (CX12–17HX∼150HX3C) is distinct from that of zinc finger proteins or the zinc binding sites in other DNA repair proteins such as formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and UvrA (8Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 544-552PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gilboa R. Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Matz E. Kycia J.H. Grollman A.P. Shoham G. J. Biol.

We propose that the minimal HhH domain is intrinsically unstable and that the zinc snap provides the stabilizing forces that are assumed by intramolecular protein-protein contacts in other larger HhH family members. Enzyme Purification—Wild-type TAG was overexpressed from pET21a(TAG) in BL21(DE3) and was purified by two sequential chromatography steps as described previously by Drohat et al. (4Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A His6-tagged version was overexpressed from pET28a(TAG) in BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. The amino-terminal tag was cleaved and removed using biotinylated thrombin, streptavidin agarose resin, and a second nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. Final purification was achieved using a Poros 20-S HPLC column (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using a linear gradient of 0.1–1 m NaCl. The purity of TAG was >95% by both procedures. Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS)—The presence of zinc in the holoenzyme was determined using a PerkinElmer model 370 atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The purified enzyme was dialyzed extensively against buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 4 ml of hydrated chelex-100 resin (Sigma)/500 ml of buffer. A 2-ml volume of TAG (2 or 5 μm) was injected into the atomic absorption spectrophotometer with monitoring at the absorption maximum for Zn2+ (213.5 nm). AAS on apoTAG was performed by the following procedures. Partial removal of Zn2+ from holoTAG was achieved using nondenaturing conditions by dialysis of the enzyme against low pH buffer B (20 mm MES, 200 mm NaCl, pH 5.5) containing 50 mm EDTA and chelating resin. Complete removal of Zn2+ was achieved by denaturing the enzyme in 0.1 m HCl and then separating the denatured apoenzyme from the released Zn2+ by gel filtration chromatography (PD-10, Amersham Biosciences). The TAG concentration was determined by UV absorbance using a calculated extinction coefficient of 30,800 m-1cm-1 in a buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) and 6 m guanidinium chloride. 2us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html. Standard solutions of ZnCl2 were used to calibrate the atomic absorption spectrophotometer. UV-visible Absorption Spectroscopy of Co2+Complex—A solution of TAG with 78% of the Zn2+ removed was prepared by dialysis against buffer B as described above. To remove EDTA and raise the pH, the enzyme (100 μl, 25 μm total protein) was exchanged into buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) using two sequential Bio-Gel P-6 gel filtration columns (Bio-Rad). An absorption spectrum of the 78% apoTAG sample (as determined from AAS) was collected in the wave-length range of 320 to 800 nm using a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. Then, 1 molar eq of CoCl2 was added quickly, and the spectrum was reacquired. A polynomial base-line subtraction was used to correct the spectrum for light scattering by apoTAG. NMR Spectroscopy—The NMR sample, prepared as described in a previous report (4Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), contained ∼0.5 mm TAG, 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.6), 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.34 mm NaN3, and 10% D2O in a total volume of 300 μl. The two-dimensional 1H-15N LR HSQC experiment was conducted at 20 °C on a Varian Unity Plus 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with four frequency channels and pulse-field gradients as described (12Drohat A.C. Xiao G. Tordova M. Jagadeesh J. Pankiewicz K.W. Watanabe K.A. Gilliland G.L. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11876-11886Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This experiment was simply a conventional HSQC used for backbone amide correlations collected with an optimized two-bond 2JNH value of 22 Hz in order to observe signals from the weak two-bond couplings in the histidine rings and suppress the signals from the one-bond JNH amide couplings. The 15N dimension was collected with 256 complex points, a 120-ppm sweep width, 128 scans, and the 15N carrier set at 205 ppm. The 1H dimension was collected with 1024 complex points and a 13.3-ppm sweep width centered at 4.82 ppm. Decoupling of 15N was accomplished with the WALTZ16 sequence (13Shaka A.J. Keeler J. Frenkiel T. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 52: 335-338Google Scholar) using a 5.1-kHz field. NMR Structural Calculations—Starting from the published NMR structure of TAG (Protein Data Bank code: 1LMZ), which was originally refined without any constraints to Zn2+, a set of 100 structures that included restraints from the enzyme ligands to Zn2+ were calculated using the program XPLOR-NIH, version 2.0.2 3nmr.cit.nih.gov/xplor-nih. (14Kuszewski J. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 146: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These calculations employed the same NOE constraints, dihedral angle, and H-bond restraints as the original structures. Additionally, because of new assignments obtained from the 1H-15N LR-HSQC experiment, a total of 11 new NOEs and three new hydrogen bonds were used as restraints in the calculation. From this set, 25 low energy structures were selected with distance restraint violations less than 0.5 Å and dihedral angle restraint violations less than 5o. Constraints between the protein ligands and the zinc ion were added using the procedure of Neuhaus et al. (15Neuhaus D. Nakaseko Y. Schwabe J.W. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The constraint values were based on tetrahedral coordination, using literature values for the HisNϵ,δ-Zn and CysSγ-Zn bond lengths of 2.0 and 2.3 Å, respectively, which were obtained from EXAFS (extended x-ray absorption fine structure) measurements (16Daikun G.P. Fairall L. Klug A. Nature. 1986; 324: 698-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The following additional distance constraints were used (15Neuhaus D. Nakaseko Y. Schwabe J.W. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar): His17Nϵ to His175Nδ, 3.1 Å < d < 3.5 Å; His17Nϵ to Cys4(or Cys179)Sγ and His175Nδ to Cys4(or Cys179)Sγ, 3.4 Å < d < 3.8 Å; His175Nδ to CysSγ, 3.4 Å < d < 3.8 Å; and Cys4Sγ to Cys179Sγ, 3.6 Å < d < 3.9 Å. The following ligand-zinc bond angles were used as constraints: His17Nϵ-Zn-His175Nδ = His17Nϵ-Zn-CysSγ = His175Nδ-Zn-CysSγ = Cys4Sγ-Zn-Cys179Sγ = Zn-CysSγ-CysCβ = 109.5o, and Zn-HisNϵ-HisCϵ = Zn-HisNδ-HisCϵ = 126o. The improper dihedral angle constraints were (Zn-HisNϵ-HisCϵ-HisNδ) = (Zn-HisNδ-HisCϵ-HisNϵ) = 180o. The zinc atom was given a charge of +2 in the calculations, and the default values for the bond and angle force constants in X-PLOR were employed (500 kcal/mol Å-2 and 70 kcal/mol Å-2, respectively). TAG Has One Tight Zn2+Binding Site—To determine whether TAG possesses a tight metal binding site, AAS measurements were performed (Table I). Two independently purified samples of TAG that had been dialyzed extensively against a neutral pH buffer containing excess chelating resin showed the presence of 1 molar eq of Zn2+ by AAS analysis (Table I). It was found that exhaustive dialysis of these same samples against a buffer that contained 40 μm CoCl2 (pH 7.5) still retained 1 eq of Zn2+, indicating that the site was inert to exchange under these conditions. Surprisingly, even extensive dialysis of the enzyme against a low pH buffer (pH 5.5) that contained 50 mm EDTA removed only about 0.8 eq of the bound metal. In fact, complete removal of Zn2+ required denaturation of the enzyme using 0.1 m HCl (Table I). These results indicate that previous reports of TAG not requiring a metal ion for activity were due to the very high binding affinity of Zn2+ for this site, which cannot be removed by standard chelating agents that are included in the purification buffers (6Riazuddin S. Lindahl T. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2110-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 14Kuszewski J. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 146: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The previously reported dramatic loss in TAG activity below pH 6 may be attributed to metal ion loss and partial protein unfolding (17Bjelland S. Seeberg E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2787-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We found that the apoTAG was unstable and aggregated extensively at pH 7.5 (data not shown).Table IZn2+ atomic absorption spectroscopy of TAG[TAG]aTwo batches of TAG, which were purified by different methods as described under “Experimental Procedures,” contained identical equivalents of bound zincSample preparation methodbThe samples were prepared by dialysis against different buffers: buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) + Chelex-100, buffer A + 40 μm CoCl2, or buffer B (20 mM MES, 200 mM NaCl, pH 5.5) + 50 mM EDTA and Chelex-100[Zn2+] detected[Zn2+]/[E]μMμM2Chelex, 7.52.0 ± 0.31.00 ± 0.155Chelex, 7.55.0 ± 0.41.00 ± 0.085CoCl2, 7.55.0 ± 0.41.00 ± 0.085EDTA, 5.51.1 ± 0.40.22 ± 0.084.80.1 M HClcTAG was denatured using 0.1 M HCl and separated from the released zinc ions using gel filtration column0.0 ± 0.20.00 ± 0.04a Two batches of TAG, which were purified by different methods as described under “Experimental Procedures,” contained identical equivalents of bound zincb The samples were prepared by dialysis against different buffers: buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) + Chelex-100, buffer A + 40 μm CoCl2, or buffer B (20 mM MES, 200 mM NaCl, pH 5.5) + 50 mM EDTA and Chelex-100c TAG was denatured using 0.1 M HCl and separated from the released zinc ions using gel filtration column Open table in a new tab Geometry and Ligands of the Zn2+Site—One valuable method for determining the ligands and coordination geometry for a Zn2+ binding site in enzymes is to perform metal replacement with Co2+, a transition metal that gives diagnostic features in its UV-visible spectra (18Rosenberg R.C.

For example, thiolate-Co2+ bonds show a diagnostic charge transfer band at about 350 nm with a typical extinction coefficient of 900–1300 m-1cm-1/thiolate ligand (21May S.W. Kuo J.Y. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3333-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Lane R.W. Ibers J.A. Frankel R.B. Papaefthymiou G.C. Holm R.H. J. Am. Chem.

Additional bands in the 576–670 nm range are indicative of the coordination geometry; tetrahedral coordination gives a strong signal (E >300 m-1cm-1), whereas pentacoordinate and octahedral sites have much lower molar absorptivities (50 < E < 225 m-1cm-1 and E < 30 m-1cm-1, respectively) (18Rosenberg R.C.

The UV-visible spectrum of Co2+-TAG (Fig. 2) is consistent with two sulfur ligands and a tetrahedral coordination geometry. Because of the extensive aggregation of apoTAG during the Co2+ spectroscopy, the concentration of the soluble protein in the cuvette could not be known precisely. However, comparing the ratio (R) of extinction coefficients of the 350 nm and 617 nm bands (R = E350/E617) after base-line correction still provides quantitative information on the number of sulfur ligands and the coordination geometry. The expected ratio for tetrahedral geometry is 1 < R < 4 for one thiolate ligand, and 2 < R < 9 for two thiolate ligands. The latter value encompasses the E350/E617 = 4 measured for TAG. This value differs considerably from the expected ratios for pentacoordinate and octahedral geometry for two thiolate ligands, which would be 8 ≤ R ≤ 52 and R ≥ 60, respectively. Although these estimates have some uncertainty, they are consistent with the strict conservation of 2 Cys and 2 His residues in the TAG family (Fig. 1), and the structural results described below. Electronic Properties of the Zn2+Ligands Determined by Heteronuclear NMR Spectroscopy—Although the Co2+ replacement studies described above indicate the ligation of two sulfur atoms to the Zn2+, the identities of the remaining two ligands are not revealed by this method. Because our previous NMR structure and the homology comparison suggested that His17 and His175 were the remaining ligands (Fig. 1), we performed a 1H-15N LR-HSQC NMR experiment to investigate the electronic properties of these histidines (Fig. 3A; the histidine spin systems in Fig. 3A were obtained from three-dimensional 13C-edited aromatic and aliphatic NOESY experiments). This simple LR-HSQC experiment correlates the carbon-bound protons of the histidine rings with the imidazole nitrogen atoms and can unambiguously establish the tautomeric and protonation states of histidines in proteins (12Drohat A.C. Xiao G. Tordova M. Jagadeesh J. Pankiewicz K.W. Watanabe K.A. Gilliland G.L. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11876-11886Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Pelton J.G. Torchia D.A. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The characteristic upside-down and sideways L-shaped patterns for the peaks in the two-dimensional spectrum for His175 and His17 and their well separated 15N chemical shifts indicate that these histidines are in the NE2-H and Nδ1-H tautomeric forms, respectively, and that both are neutral (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus the nitrogens that are available to coordinate the zinc are the Nδ1 of His175 and the Nϵ2 of His17. The 15Nδ1 shift for His175 is by far the most deshielded nitrogen of all histidines in TAG, consistent with strong chelation to an electropositive Zn2+. The 15Nϵ2 chemical shift of the ligating nitrogen of His17 is also the most deshielded of the five histidines, also indicating strong chelation to the metal from this position. Similarly, the 13Cβ chemical shifts of Cys4 and Cys179 are the most deshielded of the 8 cysteine residues of TAG, consistent with thiolate metal coordination from these side-chains (Fig. 3C). Structure of Zn2+Binding Site—Because a zinc binding site was entirely unanticipated in TAG, our previous NMR structure did not include any restraints to a Zn2+ atom (Protein Data Bank code: 1LMZ). Therefore, with unambiguous evidence for a Zn2+ site in hand, we further refined the solution structure using the same constraints employed previously but including distance and angle constraints between the Zn2+ and Cys4, His17, His175, and Cys179 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Inclusion of these constraints was justified on the basis of the UV-visible spectroscopy measurements, which indicated two sulfur ligands with tetrahedral geometry, and the LR-HSQC experiments, which indicated coordination of His17Nϵ and His175Nδ to the zinc. The addition of the zinc ion and these new constraints did not increase the Lennard-Jones potential energy for the ensemble of 25 lowest energy structures, nor did it introduce new NOE violations. For the new ensemble, about 85% of the dihedral angles are in the most favored region, with 11% in the additionally allowed region. These statistics are within error of those reported previously; further structural statistics are reported in Table II.Table IIStructural statistics for 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase 1 (TAG)Parameter{25}a{25} is the ensemble of 25 structures calculated as described in the textr.m.s.d. with respect to the mean structureBackbone atoms residues 11-1740.73 ± 0.11All heavy atoms residues 11-1741.31 ± 0.13Backbone atoms for all residues (1-187)0.93 ± 0.16All heavy atoms for all residues (1-187)1.48 ± 0.16r.m.s.d. from experimental distance restraints (Å)bNone of the structures has a distance violation >0.5 ÅIntraresidue (300)0.045 ± 0.003Sequential (477)0.043 ± 0.005Medium range (465)0.029 ± 0.003Long range (520)0.026 ± 0.005Hydrogen bonds (118)0.033 ± 0.006r.m.s.d. from ϕ/ψ dihedral angle restraints (255) (°)cThe dihedral restraints were derived using TALOS as described in the text.

This structure is nearly identical to the deposited TAG structure with r.m.s.d. values of 0.66 Å for backbone atoms and 0.86 Å for all heavy atoms for residues 11–174. The 3-methyladenine binding site, marked with an asterisk in Fig. 4A, is removed from the metal site, precluding any direct involvement of the metal in catalysis. However one metal ligand, His175, is involved in a strong H-bond to the carbonyl oxygen of the active site group, Trp21 (His175 δ(NHϵ2) = 14.75 ppm), suggesting that the zinc could indirectly organize the structure of the active site. The detailed structure of the Zn2+ binding site is shown in Fig. 4B (27Borden K.L. Lally J.M. Martin S.R. O'Reilly N.J. Etkin L.D. Freemont P.S.

Role of the Zinc Snap Motif in the Helix-Hairpin-Helix Superfamily—The Zn2+ binding site in TAG is distinct from zinc finger motifs found in bacteria to eukaryotes (28Berg J.M. J. Biol.

The four Cys zinc finger motif in MutM is in the arrangement CX2CX16CX2C and serves to stabilize two β-strands that deliver three polar side chains to their interactions with the phosphodiester backbone (9Gilboa R. Zharkov D.O. Golan G. Fernandes A.S. Gerchman S.E. Matz E. Kycia J.H. Grollman A.P. Shoham G. J. Biol.

In contrast, the zinc motif in TAG consists of two sets of CXnH submotifs, which are separated by 143–151 amino acid residues. This arrangement differs significantly from zinc finger motifs, which cluster in the region of a turn or a loop. The split zinc binding motif, with ligands donated from both termini of TAG, acts as a “snap” for closing the ends of the protein. The zinc binding site is distant from the previously modeled DNA binding region of TAG (4Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and serves to stabilize tertiary structure, but it is not involved directly in DNA binding. Given the small size of the domain, the zinc ion provides a critical stabilizing element. This is supported by our observation that the apoprotein appears to be poorly folded, leading to aggregation and eventual precipitation. Difficulties in preparation of the TAG mutant, H17A, because of low expression levels and aggregation (data not shown), are consistent with the conclusion that the Zn+2 binding motif is important for stabilization of the protein. Structural comparisons between TAG and other HhH glycosylases show that all other family members have appendages to their amino and carboxyl termini that interact extensively and are likely to contribute to stabilizing the HhH fold. Therefore, the newly revealed zinc snap motif allows the TAG family to efficiently stabilize the HhH structure without additional protein scaffolding. We thank Dr. Albert S. Mildvan for assistance with the atomic absorption spectroscopy analysis and Daniel Krosky and Lauren Morgans for helpful comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2012293507,"We present here the first structural information for HspBP1, an Hsp70 cochaperone. Using circular dichroism, HspBP1 was determined to be 35% helical. Although HspBP1 is encoded by seven exons, limited proteolysis shows that it has only two structural domains. Domain I, amino acids 1–83, is largely unstructured. Domain II, amino acids 84–359, is predicted to be 43% helical using circular dichroism. Using limited proteolysis we have also shown that HspBP1 association changes the conformation of the ATPase domain of Hsp70. Only domain II of HspBP1 is required to bring about this conformational change. Truncation mutants of HspBP1 were tested for their ability to inhibit the renaturation of luciferase and bind to Hsp70 in reticulocyte lysate. A carboxyl terminal truncation mutant that was slightly longer than domain I was inactive in these assays, but domain II was sufficient to perform both functions. Domain II was less active than full-length HspBP1 in these assays, and addition of amino acids from domain I improved both functions. These studies show that HspBP1 domain II can bind Hsp70, change the conformation of the ATPase domain, and inhibit Hsp70-associated protein folding."
https://openalex.org/W2085501040,"Functions of the terminal domains of the family D DNA polymerase from Pyrococcus horikoshii (PolDPho) were analyzed by making and characterizing various truncated proteins. Based on a co-expression vector developed previously (Shen, Y., Musti, K., Hiramoto, M., Kikuchi, H., Kawabayashi, Y., and Matsui, I. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 27376–27383), 25 vectors for terminal truncated proteins were constructed. The expressed proteins were characterized in terms of thermostability, subunit interaction, and polymerization and 3′-5′ exonuclease activities. The carboxyl-terminal (1255–1332) of the large subunit (DP2Pho) and two regions, the 201–260 and 599–622, of the small subunit (DP1Pho) were found to be critical for the complex formation, and probable subunit interaction of PolDPho. The amino-terminal (1–300) of DP2Pho is essential for the folding of PolDPho and is likely the oligomerization domain of PolDPho. A short region at the extreme C-terminal of DP2Pho (from 1385 to 1434) and the N-terminal of DP1Pho(1–200), which forms a stable protein, are not absolutely necessary for either polymerization or the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. We identified a possible regulatory role of DP1Pho(1–200) for the 3′-5′ exonuclease. Deletion of DP1Pho(1–200) increased the exonuclease and DNA binding activities of PolDPho. Adding DP1Pho(1–200) to the truncated protein suppressed the elevated exonuclease activity. We also constructed and analyzed three internal deletion mutants and two site-directed mutants in the region of the putative zinc finger motif (cysteine cluster II) of DP2Pho at the COOH-terminal.

PolD is composed of a small subunit (DP1) and a large subunit (DP2). The interaction of DP1 and DP2 is essential for the stability and full activity of the enzyme (15Uemori T. Sato Y. Kato I. Doi H.

DP1 or DP2 expressed in Escherichia coli is unstable and easily degraded. PolD possesses strong DNA polymerizing and 3′-5′ exonuclease (proofreading) activities like other DNA replication polymerases, however, common motifs for the catalysis of other DNA polymerases are absent or not functional in PolD (17Shen Y.

Several lines of evidence indicate that family D DNA polymerase is likely the major DNA polymerase or replicase in Euryarchaeota, participating in DNA replication, repair, and recombination.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4695-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). DP2 directly interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen as analyzed by in vivo immunoprecipitation assays, in vitro pull-down assays in P. furiosus (26Cann I.K. Ishino S. Hayashi I. Komori K.

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen was found to stimulate the polymerization activity of PolD of P. furiosus (26Cann I.K. Ishino S. Hayashi I. Komori K. Toh H. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6591-6599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the physical interaction of PolDPho with proliferating cell nuclear antigen was observed using gel filtration analysis, and DP2 was found to interact with replication factor C by yeast two-hybrid analysis in P. horikoshii. 2Y. Shen, X-F. Tang, and I. Matsui, unpublished data. 2Y. Shen, X-F. Tang, and I. Matsui, unpublished data. These findings strongly indicate that PolD plays an essential role in DNA replication, repair, and recombination. Despite continuous efforts, the whole structure and detailed mechanism of DNA replication of replicative DNA polymerases in the three domains of life, such as polymerase III holoenzyme in E. coli, and DNA polymerase α, δ, and ϵ in yeast, remain to be elucidated. This is particularly the case for eukaryotes whose replication mechanism has become complicated during evolution and more difficult to study. PolD might be an ideal molecule for structural analysis as a DNA replicase. Because many proteins related to DNA replication in Archaea are similar to those in eukaryotes (28Tye B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2399-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the study of archaeal replicative proteins will help us understand the DNA replication mechanism in eukaryotes. The advantage of using archaeal proteins for analysis is that they are mostly thermo-stable, and relatively easy to purify and crystallize. To improve our understanding of the structure and properties of PolD, we analyzed the domain structure using proteins truncated at the amino- and carboxyl-terminals of both DP1Pho and DP2Pho, and studied the function of the putative zinc finger motif (cysteine cluster II) at the COOH-terminal of DP2Pho using deletion and site-directed mutants. We identified putative regions responsible for subunit interaction, oligomerization, and regulation of the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity in PolDPho. We found that the internal region of the putative zinc finger motif is indispensable for the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. Two NH2-terminal fragments of DP2Pho and one NH2-terminal domain of DP1Pho were highly expressed and purified and could be used for crystal structural analysis of PolDPho. Chemicals and Bacteria Strains—The pET15b vector and ultracompetent E. coli XL2-Blue MRF′ cells were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).

Construction of Vectors for Expression of Truncated Proteins—The construction of expression vectors was based on a previously reported co-expression system and vectors (17Shen Y. Musti K. Hiramoto M.

PolDPho was expressed with a histidine tag (His tag) at the NH2 terminus of DP1Pho. To construct vectors for COOH-terminal-truncated proteins of DP2Pho, downstream primers were designed at the intended sites. Within each primer, a stop codon followed by a NsiI site was added after the nucleotide sequences at the sites of truncation (Table I). PCR was performed using an upstream primer, pGEM-rbs or L3 and site-specific primers, with the co-expression plasmid pET15b/SL as the template (Table I). The amplified fragments were digested with SacII (or SalI) and NsiI, and inserted into pET15b/SL digested with the corresponding enzymes (17Shen Y. Musti K. Hiramoto M. Kikuchi H. Kawabayashi Y.

Expression and Purification of the Enzymes—The vectors for truncated, internal deletion, and site-directed mutants were transformed into host E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL. The transformed cells were grown in 2× YT medium containing ampicillin (100 mg/liter) at 37 °C. When the A600 reached 0.6–1.0, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (2 mm) was added to induce expression of the genes. After being cultured for 4 h at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, re-suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing the protease inhibitor, and disrupted on ice by sonication. The disrupted cells were heated at 85 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min to remove cell debris and denatured proteins. The expression of both DP1Pho and DP2Pho in native or truncated forms was checked by SDS-PAGE performed on a 10–15% gradient gel using the Phast system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) then buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0). The dialysate was loaded onto a Hitrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) that was pre-equilibrated using the fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was developed with a linear gradient of 0–1000 mm NaCl. Fractions containing the PolDPho complex or a truncated single subunit were dialyzed against buffer A to remove the salt. For further purification if applicable, the samples were loaded onto a nickel column (Novagen). After a wash with a buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, the enzymes were eluted with the elution buffer containing 150 mm imidazole. For purification by gel filtration, the samples were dialyzed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and 200 mm NaCl, concentrated using a microfilter (Microcon YM-10, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and loaded onto a Hiload Superdex-200 (10/16) column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer and 200 mm NaCl (pH 8.0). The fraction was 0.5 ml and the flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. Peak fractions were collected and concentrated. The protein content was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard protein. Molecular Mass Determination—The molecular weight was estimated using fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration on a Hiload Superdex-200 (10/16) column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and 200 mm NaCl.

These kinases have 45% homology and share three tyrosine phosphorylation (TyrP) sites. Little information exists on the ability of stimulants to cause TyrP of each kinase site and the cellular mechanism involved. We explored the ability of the neurotransmitter/hormone, CCK, to stimulate TyrP at each site. In rat pancreatic acini, CCK stimulated TyrP at each site in both kinases. TyrP was rapid except for pY397FAK. The magnitude of TyrP differed with the different FAK and PYK2 sites. The CCK dose-response curve for TyrP for sites in each kinase was similar. CCK-JMV, an agonist of the high affinity receptor state and antagonist of the low affinity receptor state, was less efficacious than CCK at each FAK/PYK2 site and inhibited CCK maximal stimulation. Thapsigargin decreased CCK-stimulated TyrP of pY402PYK2 and pY925FAK but not the other sites. GF109203X reduced TyrP of only the PYK2 sites, pY402 and pY580.

However, CCK-stimulated TyrP at these sites differs in kinetics, magnitude, and participation of the high/low affinity receptor states and by protein kinase C and [Ca2+]i.

Unless otherwise stated, the standard incubation solution contained 25.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 98 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 2.5 mm NaH2PO4,5mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm sodium fumarate, 5 mm sodium glutamate, 11.5 mm glucose, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm glutamine, 1% (w/v) albumin, 1% (w/v) trypsin inhibitor, 1% (v/v) vitamin mixture, and 1% (w/v) amino acid mixture. The incubation solution was equilibrated with 100% O2, and all of the incubations were performed with 100% O2 as the gas phase. Dispersed acini from one or two rats were preincubated with standard incubation solution without or with different inhibitors for 3 h at 37 °C. For the experiments in a calcium-free medium, acini were washed two times in calcium-free incubation buffer after 150 min of incubation prior to adding thapsigargin for 30 min. The aliquots (1 ml) were then incubated at 37 °C with different agonists at the concentrations and times indicated. Acinar lysates were obtained as described previously (19Garcia L.J. Rosado J.A. Gonzalez A. Jensen R.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Ferris H.A. Tapia J.A. Garcia L.J. Jensen R.T.

Briefly, acini were sonicated for 5 s at 4 °C in 1 ml of a solution containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) NaN3, 1 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm EDTA, 2.5 g/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm Na3VO4. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent as follows. For the protein assay all of the samples were diluted 10 times. The same proportion of lysis buffer was added to all standards. All of the samples were measured in triplicate. We confirmed that the Bio-Rad assay using the above methods reliably measured the protein concentration of our lysates, confirming that the same results were obtained using the BCA protein assay. The BCA protein assay is not affected by these detergents even at 50 times greater concentration than was used in our protein assay. Total acinar cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels and Western blotting loading equal amounts of cellular proteins (30 μg). Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed as described previously (9Tapia J.A. Ferris H.A. Jensen R.T. Marin L.J. J. Biol.

The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature and incubated for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml anti-pY402 PYK2 pAb, 0.064 μg/ml anti-pY580 PYK2 pAb, 1.58 μg/ml anti-pY881 PYK2 pAb, 0.07 μg/ml anti-pY397 FAK pAb, 0.45 μg/ml anti-pY577 FAK pAb, or 0.15 μg/ml anti-pY925 FAK pAb. The membranes were washed twice and incubated 1 h at 25 °C with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The membranes were washed, and the proteins were visualized using ECL reagents and Hyperfilm ECL. The density of bands was measured using a Kodak Imaging System (Kodak Imaging System 440 CF, Kodak, Rochester, NY). When reprobing was necessary, the membranes were stripped of bound antibodies by incubating in stripping buffer (0.1 m glycine, pH 2.2, 1% Tween 20, 0.1% SDS) at room temperature with agitation as described previously (29Ferris H.A. Tapia J.A. Garcia L.J. Jensen R.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The membranes were then incubated twice for 20 min with washing solution and blocked for 1 h at room temperature. Equal protein loading was verified using PYK2 mAb for membranes that were used for the PYK2 phosphospecific antibodies and with FAK mAb for the membranes used for FAK phosphospecific antibodies. The membranes were incubated for 1.5 h with PYK2 mAb or FAK mAb at room temperature, washed as described above, and incubated for 45 min with anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. The membranes were then washed, and the proteins were visualized as described above. CCK-8 (1 nm) caused an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of each of the three phosphorylation sites of PYK2 and FAK (Fig. 1). With each of the three tyrosine phosphorylation sites of PYK2 and FAK the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was rapid, and the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation was biphasic with a decrease after the initial peak (Fig. 1). However, there were differences in both the magnitude and kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of the different sites. Maximal phosphorylation for all three PYK2 phosphorylation sites, i.e. pY402, pY580, and pY881 was reached after 0.5–1 min as it was for tyrosine phosphorylation of the FAK phosphorylation sites pY577 and pY925 (Fig. 1 and Table I). In contrast, maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of the FAK phosphorylation site pY397 was delayed to 2.5 min (Fig. 1 and Table I). Maximal fold increase in the three PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation sites was reached at the phosphorylation site pY580 with a 5.5 ± 1.2-fold, followed by a lesser degree of stimulation of pY402 and pY881 (Fig. 1 and Table I). At the FAK phosphorylation sites, pY925 demonstrated the greatest maximal fold increase of 3.9 ± 0.5-fold, followed by pY577 and pY397 (Fig. 1 and Table I).Table IComparison of characteristics of basal and CCK-stimulated site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 and FAK in rat pancreatic acinar cellsThe results are calculated from the data shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. For CCK-JMV and the basal phosphorylation, the results are expressed as the percentages of the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation (TyrP) caused by a maximally effective concentration of CCK-8 (1 nM).

With each of the six phosphorylation sites, CCK-8 caused a detectable increase with concentrations greater then 0.01 nm CCK-8, a half-maximal increase with 0.05–0.13 nm CCK-8, and a maximal increase with 1 nm CCK-8 (Fig. 2). Concentrations greater than 1 nm CCK-8 caused either a maximal or a slight decrease in maximal stimulation of each of the six phosphospecific sites (Fig. 2). Numerous studies show that CCKA can activate both a high and low affinity state and can mediate different cellular responses (20Yule D.I. Williams J.A. Johnson L.R. Alpers D.H. Christensen J.

To establish the degree of participation of the high and low CCKA receptor states in tyrosine phosphorylation of each PYK2 and FAK phosphospecific site, we treated pancreatic acini with CCK-JMV (1 μm), which is known to be an agonist at the CCKA high affinity receptor state and an antagonist at the low affinity CCKA receptor state in rat pancreatic acini (31Sato S.

At all six phosphospecific sites a 1 μm concentration of CCK-JMV, which is known to be maximally effective as an agonist for the high affinity and as an antagonist for the low affinity CCKA receptor state (31Sato S.

Acta. 1989; 1010: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation from 9 to 45% of the maximum response seen with CCK-8 (Fig. 3). The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation caused by CCK-JMV (1 μm) was higher in the three PYK2 phosphorylation sites (i.e. from 33 to 45% of maximum) than in the three FAK phosphorylation sites (i.e. from 9 to 19% of maximum) (Fig. 3 and Table I). Because at all six phosphorylation sites, CCK-JMV-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation alone did not reach the maximal response that was obtained with CCK-8, it can be concluded that stimulation of the high affinity state by CCK-8 mediates less than 46% of tyrosine phosphorylation of the three specific sites of PYK2 and less than 20% for the FAK sites. To provide evidence that most of the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation at each site was mediated by CCK activating the low affinity CCKA receptor state, CCK-JMV was tested in combination with CCK-8 because it is an inhibitor of the low affinity state (31Sato S. Stark H.A. Martinez J. Beaven M.A. Jensen R.T. Gardner J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: G202-G209PubMed Google Scholar, 32Galas M.C. Lignon M.F. Rodriquez M. Mendre C. Fulcrand P. Laur J. Martinez J.

CCK-JMV antagonized the ability of CCK-8 to stimulate maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of the three PYK2 and the three FAK phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3), confirming that CCK-8 was mediating tyrosine phosphorylation of each of these sites by also activating the low affinity CCKA receptor state. CCKA receptor stimulation activates phospholipase C, which promotes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, leading to the production of diacylglycerol (20Yule D.I. Williams J.A.

Therefore, we next studied whether CCK-8-stimulated phosphorylation of the three PYK2 and the three FAK phosphorylation sites is dependent on changes in cellular calcium (Fig. 4), activation of PKC (Fig. 5), or activation of both PLC cascades (Fig. 5). To determine the role of intracellular calcium changes, pancreatic acinar cells were pretreated for 30 min in a calcium-free medium (with 5 mm EGTA) with thapsigargin (10 μm), an agent that specifically inhibits the endoplasmatic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and depletes calcium from intracellular compartments (9Tapia J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2048842346,"Intercalated and inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells of the kidney mediate the transport of H+ by a plasma membrane H+-ATPase. The rate of H+ transport in these cells is regulated by exocytic insertion of H+-ATPase-laden vesicles into the apical membrane. We have shown that the exocytic insertion of proton pumps (H+-ATPase) into the apical membrane of rat IMCD cells, in culture, involves SNARE proteins (syntaxin (synt), SNAP-23, and VAMP). The membrane fusion complex observed in IMCD cells with the induction of proton pump exocytosis not only included these SNAREs but also the H+-ATPase. Based on these observations, we suggested that the targeting of these vesicles to the apical membrane is mediated by an interaction between the H+-ATPase and a specific t-SNARE. To evaluate this hypothesis, we utilized a “pull-down” assay in which we identified, by Western analysis, the proteins in a rat kidney medullary homogenate that complexed with glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion syntaxin isoforms attached to Sepharose 4B-glutathione beads. The syntaxin isoforms employed were 1A, 1B, 2, 4, 5, and also 1A that was truncated to exclude the H3 SNARE binding domain (synt-1AΔH3). All full-length syntaxin isoforms formed complexes with SNAP-23 and VAMP. Neither GST nor synt-1AΔH3 formed complexes with these SNAREs. H+-ATPase (subunits E, a, and c) bound to syntaxin-1A and to a lesser extent to synt-1B but not to synt-1AΔH3 or synt-2, -4, and -5. In cultured IMCD cells transfected to express syntaxin truncated for the membrane binding domain (synt-ΔC), expression of synt-1AΔC, but not synt-4ΔC, inhibited H+-ATPase exocytosis. In conclusion, because all full-length syntaxins examined bound VAMP-2 and SNAP-23, but only non-H3-truncated syntaxin-1 bound H+-ATPase, and synt-1AΔC expression by intact IMCD cells inhibited H+-ATPase exocytosis, it is likely that the H+-ATPase binds directly to the H3 domain of syntaxin-1 and not through VAMP-2 or SNAP-23. Interaction between the syntaxin-1A and H+-ATPase is important in the targeted exocytosis of the proton pump to the apical membrane of intercalated cells. Intercalated and inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells of the kidney mediate the transport of H+ by a plasma membrane H+-ATPase. The rate of H+ transport in these cells is regulated by exocytic insertion of H+-ATPase-laden vesicles into the apical membrane.

To evaluate this hypothesis, we utilized a “pull-down” assay in which we identified, by Western analysis, the proteins in a rat kidney medullary homogenate that complexed with glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion syntaxin isoforms attached to Sepharose 4B-glutathione beads. The syntaxin isoforms employed were 1A, 1B, 2, 4, 5, and also 1A that was truncated to exclude the H3 SNARE binding domain (synt-1AΔH3). All full-length syntaxin isoforms formed complexes with SNAP-23 and VAMP. Neither GST nor synt-1AΔH3 formed complexes with these SNAREs. H+-ATPase (subunits E, a, and c) bound to syntaxin-1A and to a lesser extent to synt-1B but not to synt-1AΔH3 or synt-2, -4, and -5. In cultured IMCD cells transfected to express syntaxin truncated for the membrane binding domain (synt-ΔC), expression of synt-1AΔC, but not synt-4ΔC, inhibited H+-ATPase exocytosis. In conclusion, because all full-length syntaxins examined bound VAMP-2 and SNAP-23, but only non-H3-truncated syntaxin-1 bound H+-ATPase, and synt-1AΔC expression by intact IMCD cells inhibited H+-ATPase exocytosis, it is likely that the H+-ATPase binds directly to the H3 domain of syntaxin-1 and not through VAMP-2 or SNAP-23. Interaction between the syntaxin-1A and H+-ATPase is important in the targeted exocytosis of the proton pump to the apical membrane of intercalated cells.

Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1985; 39: 149-157PubMed Google Scholar, 2Brown D. Hirsch S. Bluck S. Nature. 1988; 331: 622-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The rate of H+ transport in these cells is regulated in part by exocytic insertion and endocytic retrieval of H+-ATPase-coated vesicles (1Al-Awqati Q. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1985; 39: 149-157PubMed Google Scholar, 3Schwartz G.J. Al-Awqati Q. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 153-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that the exocytic insertion of proton pumps (H+-ATPase) into the apical membrane of rat IMCD cells in culture utilizes a mechanism similar to that described in neurosecretory cells involving SNARE proteins (syntaxin, SNAP-23, and VAMP-2) (4Banerjee A. Shih T. Alexander E.A. Schwartz J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26518-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Banerjee A. Li G. Alexander E.A. Schwartz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C775-C781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This conclusion is based on the following observations. 1) IMCD cells express all of the SNARES (syntaxins, VAMP-1, and –2, and SNAP 23) along with synaptotagmin, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, and α and γ SNAP that are required for vesicle targeting and fusion (4Banerjee A. Shih T. Alexander E.A. Schwartz J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26518-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Banerjee A. Li G. Alexander E.A. Schwartz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C775-C781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2) Clostridial toxins that act as highly specific SNARE proteases inhibit H+-ATPase exocytosis and H+ secretion (6Alexander E.A. Shih T. Schwartz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F1054-F1057PubMed Google Scholar, 7Alexander E.A. Brown D. Shih T. McKee M. Schwartz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C758-C763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3) Activation of regulated exocytosis by acute acidification of IMCD cells induces the formation of a SNARE complex that includes syntaxin, VAMP-2, SNAP-23, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, SNAPs, and a subunit of the H+-ATPase (4Banerjee A. Shih T. Alexander E.A. Schwartz J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26518-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the targeting signal for these acid secretory vesicles may differ from that of neurosecretory vesicles in that a subunit of the H+-ATPase itself may be required for delivery of these vesicles to the apical membrane. The role of SNAREs in targeting vesicles is controversial (8Pellham H.R.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 99-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 9Scales S.J. Chen Y.A. Yoo B.Y. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2000; 26: 457-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that these proteins only serve as the machinery for fusion (10Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 11Banfield D.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 67-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). There is evidence that v- and t-SNAREs are promiscuous, and in in vitro assays a given v-SNARE can form complexes with many different t-SNAREs (12Gotte M. von Mollard G.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 215-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in several cell types, the distribution of t-SNAREs is restricted to specific membrane domains (10Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Such a restriction is consistent with a role of these SNAREs in the targeting process. In the current study we have examined the hypothesis that H+-ATPase in renal acid-secretory cells interacts directly with an apical membrane receptor, a t-SNARE, and that this t-SNARE is a specific isoform of syntaxin (synt). The specificity of this interaction between H+-ATPase and syntaxin provides for the targeting of the H+-ATPase to the apical membrane of renal epithelial cells. To evaluate this hypothesis, we first demonstrated that, in a pull-down assay, GST fusion syntaxin (1A, 1B, 2, 4, and 5) isoforms, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and identified in both intact renal medulla and cultured IMCD cells, could all complex with VAMP-1 and SNAP-23 in kidney homogenate. However, only syntaxin-1 could complex with H+-ATPase. Deletion of the SNARE binding (H3) domain of syntaxin-1 interfered with the ability of this t-SNARE to bind other SNAREs and also H+-ATPase. Transfected IMCD cells that express a cytoplasmic (soluble) form of syntaxin-1A (deletion of membrane binding domain, synt-1AΔC) had a marked reduction in regulated H+-ATPase exocytosis compared with wild type cells or cells that expressed a soluble form of syntaxin-4 (synt-4ΔC). Finally, we have shown in these cells by fluorescent microscopy that syntaxin-1 is localized to the apical membrane. Thus, it can be demonstrated that there is isoform-specific interaction between H+-ATPase and syntaxin-1 and that the specificity of the interaction and localization of syntaxin-1 can account for both targeting and fusion of H+-ATPase vesicles with the apical plasma membrane. Rat kidney inner medulla was homogenized using Teflon-coated Dounce homogenizer in a buffer consisting of HB, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl, 320 mm sucrose. Just before use, 1 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg of leupeptin, and 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min to obtain a post-nuclear supernatant. Triton X-100 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1% and homogenized a second time in a Dounce. This 1% Triton X-100-treated homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The final supernatant was collected and stored at –80 °C for binding assays. Messenger RNA was purified from IMCD cells, rat renal medulla, and brain tissue using a commercial poly(A) pure kit (Ambion Inc.), and this RNA was analyzed by Rt-PCR to identify mRNA expression of syntaxin-1A, -1B, -2, -4, and -5. Primers for Syntaxin Isoforms to be Cloned into the PGEX Vectors to Express GST-Syntaxin Fusion Proteins—To facilitate the subsequent expression vector constructs, some restriction sites were added to the primers so that the PCR products from these primers can be inserted into the corresponding restriction sites of appropriate vectors. The primers used are as follows: 1) for Synt-1A: upstream, 5′-cac gaattc aa AAG GAC CGA ACC CAG GAG-3′; downstream, 5′-taa ctcgagATC CAA AGA TGC CCC CGA TG-3. An EcoRI and XhoI restriction site was added to the 5′-terminal end of the upstream and downstream primers, respectively. When spliced into the EcoRI and XhoI cloning site of the vector PGEX-4T2, it enables the synt-1A PCR template to fuse with the GST codon beginning at the second codon, including amino acids 2–288 of syntaxin-1A. 2) For Synt 1B: upstream, 5′-cac gaattc gg ATG AAG GAT CGG ACT CAG-3′; downstream, 5′-cat ctcgagTTT TGG GAG TGA GCT TGG AG-3′. Again, EcoRI and XhoI sites were introduced into the 5′-terminal end of the primers. The PCR product was spliced into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of PGE X-4T2 where it fuses with GST in-frame starting at the first codon of S1B, including amino acids 1–289 of syntaxin-1B. 3) For Synt-2: upstream, 5′-aat agaattCGG CTG CCG GAC CTC ACG-3′; downstream, 5′-gac ctcgagCAT TTG CCA ACC GTC AAG-3′. EcoRI and XhoI sites were also attached to the 5′-terminal end of the primers. The PCR product of these primers was spliced into the cloning sites of EcoRI and XhoI of PGEX 4T2 enabling the fourth codon of the synt-2 template to be fused in-frame with GST, including amino acids 4–291 of syntaxin-2. 4) For Synt-4: upstream, 5′-aat ggatcCGC GAC AGG ACC CAT GAG TTG-3′; downstream, 5′-acg gaattcTCC CAG TGC CAA GAA CAT GTG-3′. A BamHI and EcoRI restriction site was added to the 5′-terminal end of upstream and downstream primers, respectively, to facilitate the subsequent cloning step. When the PCR product of these primers was spliced into the BamHI and EcoRI cloning site of the vector PGEX 3X, it made the synt-4 template fuse in-frame with GST, starting at the 2nd codon including amino acids 2–299 of syntaxin-4. 5) For synt-5: upstream, 5′-caa ggatcc aa ATG TCC TGC CGG GAT C-3′; downstream, 5′-cac gaattcTCA GGC AAG GAA GAC CAC-3′. BamHI and EcoRI site was introduced into the 5′-terminal end of the primers. The PCR product was spliced into vector PGEX 3X so that synt-5 fused with GST in-frame, including amino acids 1–302. 6) For syntaxin-1A ΔH3ΔC: upstream, 5′-cac gaattc aa AAG GAC CGA ACC CAG GAG-3′; downstream, 5′-taa ctcgagACT GGT CGT GGT CCG GCC AG-3′. These primers were designed to splice the synt-1A sequence 2–162 (amino acids) into the cloning site of EcoRI and XhoI of PGEX 4T2 to generate a truncation of the H3 binding and transmembrane domain of synt-1A. Primers for Syntaxin Isoform to be Cloned into Pc DNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO for Expression of GFP-Syntaxin Isoforms—For syntaxin-1A full-length (amino acids 1–289): synt-1AF, upstream, 5′-atg aag gac cga acc cag gag-3′; downstream, 5′-cta tcc aaa gat gcc ccc gat g-3′. For synt-1A cytosolic form with the C-terminal transmembrane domain truncated (amino acids 1–261): synt-1AΔC, upstream, 5′-atg aag gac cga acc cag gag-3′; downstream, 5′-cta tgc ctt gct ctg gta ctt g-3′. For synt-1A with both the transmembrane and H3 snare binding domain truncated (amino acids 1–162): synt-1AΔCΔH3, upstream, 5′-atg aag gac cga acc cag gag-3′; downstream, 5′-cta act ggt cgt ggt ccg gcc ag-3′. For synt-4 cytosolic form with the transmembrane domain truncated (amino acids 1–258): synt-4ΔC, upstream: 5′-atg cgc gac agg acc cat gag-3′; downstream, 5′-tta gac atg ttc ttg ccc acg-3′. All the primer DNA-oligo samples were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Reverse transcription was accomplished by using 0.1 μg of mRNA as template and oligo(dT)16 as reverse transcriptase primer in a total volume of 20 μl; after incubation at room temperature for 10 min, the reaction temperature was raised to 42 °C for 15 min, denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, and then cooled to 5 °C for 5 min. Then 1 nmol of each upstream and downstream PCR primer and other components for PCR were added to a total volume of 100 μl (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, GeneAmp RNA PCR kit). The PCR was performed on a MiniCycler TM with the time and temperature as follows: melting point, 95 °C, 60 s; annealing, 60 °C, 30 s; extending, 72 °C, 120 s for 30 cycles followed by a 7-min extension at 72 °C. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. GST-Syntaxin Isoform Fusion Protein Expression Vectors—Corresponding bands of the PCR products separated on the agarose gel were purified using a commercial kit (QIAEX II, Gel Extraction kit, Qiagen Inc.) and subjected to enzyme restriction cut as indicated by the attached enzyme restriction site in the primers. Vectors PGEX 4T2 and PGEX 3X were also cut with the same enzyme as the PCR product to be inserted. All the cut DNA were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels and extracted as indicated above. PCR products encoding synt-1A, -1B, -2, and -1A ΔH3ΔC sequence were spliced into the EcoRI and XhoI restriction site of PGEX 4T2 for expression of GST fusion protein. PCR products encoding S4 and S5 sequence were cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI cloning site of PGEX 3X for expression of GST fusion protein. GFP-Syntaxin Isoform Fusion Protein Expression Vectors—Rt-PCR products from primers for cloning into PcDNA 3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO were ligated directly with PcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO vector, and the clones with the insertion in the right orientation were picked up for transfection of IMCD cells. All the final clones of recombinant vector were DNA sequenced to confirm the correct insertion. Proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli BL 21 strains. Three hours after induction of the E. coli with IPTG, the bacteria were homogenized in PBS (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3), and the expressed protein was purified from this homogenate by binding the fusion protein to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in accordance with the manufacturer's instruction for batch purification (Amersham Biosciences). The purity of the isolated fusion protein was assessed by gel electrophoresis. GST-syntaxin isoform fusion protein (25 μg) fixed on beads and 800 μg of kidney homogenate protein were incubated at 4 °C overnight in HB buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride added just before use) with gentle agitation. Proteins bound to beads were recovered by centrifuging at 500 × g for 5 min and washed three times with buffer (HB containing 0.5% Triton X-100). The protein attached to the washed beads was solubilized in an equal volume of 2× SDS sampler buffer (final concentration: 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm DTT, 10% glycerin, 2% SDS, and 0.1 bromphenol blue) and heated for 5 min at 95 °C and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody. After incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, the blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method. The film were scanned and then subjected to band densitometry and quantification (NIH Image). Antibodies used in this study are as follows: for H+-ATPase antibodies: rabbit antibody to the 31-kDa subunit of the H+-ATPase (gift of D. Brown); rabbit polyclonal antibody to the 116-kDa subunit (Synaptic Systems GmbH); and a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the 16-kDa subunit (Ductin) (Oncogene Research Products). For Snap-23 antibodies: rabbit antibody to Snap-23, from Synaptic Systems GmbH. For synaptobrevin/VAMP: mouse monoclonal antibody to synaptobrevin/VAMP, from Synaptic System GmbH. For syntaxin 1A: mouse monoclonal antibody to syntaxin-1A, clone HPC-1 (Sigma). For syntaxin-4: rabbit antibody to syntaxin-4 Synaptic Systems GmbH. The secondary antibodies for the immunoblot were peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and -mouse IgG and were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. DNA fragments from Rt-PCR coding the full-length syntaxin-1A-(1–289) (synt-1AF), syntaxin-1AΔC-(1–261), syntaxin 1AΔH3ΔC-(1–162), and syntaxin-4ΔH3ΔC-(1–259) were ligated into the pc DNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Cloning with the right ligation was confirmed with PCR using the GFP forward and syntaxin isoform-specific reverse primers. Purified recombinant plasmids were used to transfect the IMCD cell using calcium phosphate precipitation and a selection medium containing 800 μg/ml G418. Survived cell were further selected to yield monoclonal cell lines using the method of limited dilution. Stable cell lines that express GFP-syntaxin mutant protein were confirmed by directly viewing the GFP fluorescence, immuno-staining, and immunoblotting with GFP antibody and syntaxin isoform-specific antibodies. Positive clones were used for experiments. Wild type IMCD cells and IMCD cells transfected to express various GFP-syntaxin constructs were used to assess the effect of acute cellular acidification on the exocytic insertion of proton pumps into the apical membrane. Apical membranes were isolated from monolayers of wild type IMCD and IMCD cells transfected with GFP-syntaxin constructs by a vesiculation method modified in our laboratory for polarized epithelial cells (7Alexander E.A. Brown D. Shih T. McKee M. Schwartz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C758-C763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control (pHi ∼7.2) or acid-loaded cells, in which the pHi falls to 6.5, were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in a vesiculation medium (CHB or NHB (7Alexander E.A. Brown D. Shih T. McKee M. Schwartz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C758-C763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) that contained 50 mm paraformaldehyde, 2 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors. Paraformaldehyde and DTT induced the formation of apical membrane vesicles that are released into the incubation medium. At the end of 90 min, the medium containing the released apical membrane vesicles were collected, filtered through 37-μm nylon mesh to remove whole cells, and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Sorval RC5B centrifuged for 1 h to pellet the vesicles. The pellet was aliquoted for protein determination and dissolved in SDS sample buffer for subjecting to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Syntaxin Isoforms Expressed in Rat Renal Medulla—Although there are a large number of isoforms of syntaxin, we have restricted our studies to the isoforms of syntaxin that are localized to the apical plasma membrane of renal collecting duct cells and one isoform (syntaxin-5) that is largely restricted to Golgi membranes (10Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). We were able to demonstrate that rat renal medulla expresses syntaxin-1A, -1B, -2, -4, and -5 utilizing appropriate primers and Rt-PCR of messenger RNA isolated from rat renal medulla (Fig. 1). The products obtained were the appropriate size for syntaxin-1A (882 bp, 2nd and 3rd lanes), -1B (984 bp, 4th and 5th lanes), -2 (878 bp, 6th and 7th lanes), 4 (924 bp, 8th and 9th lanes) and 5 (925 bp, 10th and 11th lanes). No PCR products were identified if the Rt step was omitted. Molecular identification of these products was confirmed by sequence analysis, and all products were >97% identical to the published sequences for these rat syntaxins. All of these isoforms were expressed in both kidney and brain with the exception of syntaxin-2, which was only expressed in kidney. Rt-PCR analysis of mRNA derived from cultured IMCD cells also documented that these epithelial cells expressed these isoforms of syntaxin (data not shown). Thus, renal tubular cells in the distal nephron express multiple isoforms of syntaxin including syntaxin-1A that has been thought to be restricted to neuroendocrine tissue (13Inoue A. Akagawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Binding of VAMP, SNAP-23, and H+-ATPase to Syntaxin Fusion Proteins—To test the hypothesis that syntaxin-1A specifically binds H+-ATPase in addition to the other v- and t-SNAREs necessary to form a fusion complex, we compared the capacity of immobilized fusion GST syntaxins to bind SNAP-23, VAMP, and H+-ATPase. The fusion proteins were produced by transformed, IPTG-induced E. coli purified and bound to glutathione-Sepharose G4 beads (Fig. 2). Rat kidney homogenate was incubated with beads coated with either GST alone or equivalent amounts of GST-syntaxin isoforms 1A, 1B, 2, 4, 5, and 1AΔCΔH3, a truncated syntaxin-1A missing the C-terminal and H3 domain (Fig. 3). After extensive washing of the beads with HB + 0.5% Triton X-100, the proteins on the beads were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis as follows: (a) subunits of the H+-ATPase from the V1 domain (31-kDa subunit E) and from the V0 domain (116-kDa subunit a, and 16-kDa subunit c) (Fig. 3A) (14Fotgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 15Galli T. McPherson P.S. De Camilli P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 3877-3881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (b) VAMP; and (c) SNAP-23 (Fig. 3B). Compared with control beads coated only with GST, beads coated with syntaxin-1A or -B bound appreciable amounts of H+-ATPase. Syntaxin-1A-coated beads bound 8 times (p < 0.05, n= 6) and syntaxin-1B coated beads bound 3 times (p < 0.05, n = 5) more 31-kDa subunit of the H+-ATPase than did control beads. The other isoforms, syntaxin-2, -4, -5, and -1AΔH3 bound no more 31-kDa subunit of the H+-ATPase than background. The binding pattern of the 16- and 116-kDa (Vo) subunits of the H+-ATPase to syntaxin isoforms was similar to that of the 31-kDa subunit (Fig. 3A). The binding of both of V1 (31 kD) and Vo (16 and 116 kDa) subunits to syntaxin-1 indicates that intact proton pump units interact with this t-SNARE. In contrast, all of the full-length syntaxin isoforms bound VAMP and SNAP-23 (Fig. 3B). Deletion of the H3 domain of syntaxin-1A (17Zhong P. Chen Y.A. Tam D. Chung D. Scheller R.H. Miljanich G.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4317-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) resulted in a mutant that, as expected, did not bind VAMP or SNAP-23, but surprisingly, this construct also did not bind H+-ATPase.Fig. 3Binding of H+-ATPase, VAMP, and SNAP-23 to immobilized syntaxin fusion proteins. Detergent-solubilized rat kidney homogenate was incubated with beads coated with either GST or GST fusion syntaxin isoforms 1A, 1B, 2, 4, 5, and 1AΔH3, a truncated synt-1A missing the C-terminal and H3 domain (A), or syntaxin isoforms 1A, 1B, 2, 4, 5, 1AΔH3, or GST (B). After extensive washing of the beads with HB + 0.5% Triton X-100, the proteins on the beads were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis for subunits of the H+-ATPase from the V1 domain (31-kDa subunit E) and from the V0 domain (116-kDa subunit a and 16-kDa subunit C) (A) or for VAMP and SNAP-23. These immunoblots are representative of four separate experiments (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expression of Syntaxin Fusion Proteins by IMCD Cells and Effects on Exocytic Insertion of H+-ATPase into Apical Plasma Membrane—To demonstrate that the specificity of binding documented in our in vitro studies occurs also within intact cells, we generated several transfected IMCD cell lines that expressed various GFP-syntaxin constructs. Our working assumption was that the expression of syntaxin-1A that lacked a membrane binding domain but retained the v-SNARE and H+-ATPase binding domain could act as an inhibitor of regulated H+-ATPase exocytosis. For these studies we developed 4 cell lines: one cell line expressed full-lengthGFP-syntaxin-1A (GFP-synt-1A), a second expressed a truncation of syntaxin-1A in which there was a deletion of the C-terminal membrane binding domain (GFP-synt-1AΔC) (18Naren A.P. Quick M.W. Collawn J.F. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10972-10977Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the third, GFP-synt-1AΔCΔH3, was a truncation of both the membrane binding domain and the H3, v-SNARE binding domain, and the last cell line expressed a truncation of syntaxin-4 that also had a deletion of the C-terminal membrane binding domain (GFP-synt-4ΔC). All cell lines expressed a similar amount of fusion protein as judged by immunoblot analysis of whole cell homogenate. The fusion protein was detected utilizing an antibody to the GFP portion of the fusion protein (Fig. 4A). However, the distribution of full-length GFP-synt-1A was distinct from the truncated form, GFP-synt-1AΔC. The full-length form was found to be primarily localized to the membrane fraction (Fig. 4B), whereas the truncated form was primarily in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 4B). Immunohistochemical studies also confirmed this biochemical observation (Fig. 4C). GFP-synt-1A was localized in discrete vesicles and plasma membranes, and GFP-synt1AΔC was diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol but not the plasma membrane (Fig. 4C). The distribution of endogenous synt-1A in non-transfected cells is similar to the distribution of GFP-synt-1A in transfected cells in that both are restricted to membranes. In non-transfected cells, immunohistochemical studies indicate that endogenous synt-1A is primarily localized to the apical membrane (Fig. 5, left).Fig. 5Immunolocalization of native syntaxin-1A in non-transfected IMCD cells. Cells were stained with a mouse anti-syntaxin-1 monoclonal antibody and examined by confocal microscopy. The photomicrograph in the left panel represents an image obtained at the apex of the cell. The staining indicates that syntaxin-1A is present in the apical membrane. The right panel is an image obtained at the level of the nucleus in the same cells. The staining in a perinuclear distribution indicated that Golgi vesicle may contain syntaxin-1A, but the lack of staining at the periphery of the cell indicates that there is no basolateral localization of this SNARE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When wild rat IMCD cells in culture are subjected to cellular acidification, exocytic insertion of H+-ATPase vesicles into the apical membrane is activated (7Alexander E.A.

This induced exocytic response to cellular acidification results in an enhancement in the amount of H+-ATPase present in the apical membrane of wild type IMCD cells without change in a resident apical membrane protein such as GP-135 (Fig. 6). Transfected cells expressing GFP-synt-1A, GFP-synt-1AΔCΔH3, or GFP-synt-4ΔC, when subjected to cellular acidification, displayed a similar degree of apical membrane H+-ATPase amplification (Fig. 6) to that of non-transfected cells. However, when cells that express GFP-synt-1AΔC, a form of syntaxin that retains the binding sites for v-SNAREs and H+-ATPase but lacks the membrane binding domain, are subjected to cellular acidification, apical membrane H+-ATPase amplification was abolished (Fig. 6). Thus, this soluble, truncated construct of syntaxin-1A appears to act as a specific inhibitor of regulated exocytosis. To evaluate this hypothesis further, we determined whether any of these constructs of syntaxin could be co-immunoprecipitated with H+-ATPase (Fig. 7). Both GFP-synt-1A and GFP-synt-1AΔC could be co-immunoprecipitated with H+-ATPase, but GFP-synt-4ΔC could not. These observations indicate that soluble GFP-synt-1AΔC binds to H+-ATPase and by so doing interferes with its targeting to the apical membrane.Fig. 7Co-immunoprecipitation of the 31-kDa subunit of the H+-ATPase and GFP-syntaxin-1A. Homogenates from cells transfected with GFP-synt-1A, -1AΔC, and -4ΔC were subjected to immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-H+-ATPase polyclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot and probed for GFP-syntaxin constructs with an anti-GFP antibody. The 1st 3 lanes are whole cell homogenates, and 4th to 6th lanes are the immunoprecipitates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Regulation of H+ secretion in the collecting duct of the mammalian kidney involves amplification of the number of apical membrane proton pumps (H+-ATPase) by regulated exocytic insertion and reduction by endocytic retrieval of these pumps into a subapical population of recycled vesicles (1Al-Awqati Q. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1985; 39: 149-157PubMed Google Scholar, 3Schwartz G.J. Al-Awqati Q. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 153-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recycled proton pump containing vesicles is unusual in that their cytoplasmic surface is almost entirely coated with the V1 portion of the H+-ATPase (19Brown D. Gluck S. Hartwig J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1637-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In cultured rat IMCD cells we have demonstrated that the process of regulated exocytic insertion of H+-ATPase containing vesicles into the apical membrane involves a process analogous to neurosecretion. The vesicle fusion process in these cells involves SNAREs with the formation of a large, clostridial, toxin-sensitive complex that includes syntaxin, SNAP-23, VAMP, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, and α and γ SNAP (4Banerjee A. Shih T. Alexander E.A. Schwartz J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26518-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The complex differs in that it also contains the H+-ATPase (4Banerjee A. Shih T. Alexander E.A. Schwartz J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26518-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Banerjee A. Li G. Alexander E.A. Schwartz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C775-C781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to mediating fusion, the SNARE proteins may be involved in the targeting of the H+-ATPase vesicles to the apical membrane. This latter role of SNAREs in targeting is controversial because SNARE pairing can be promiscuous (12Gotte M. von Mollard G.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 215-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, factors other than the specificity of SNARE pairing may allow these proteins to participate in the targeting process. Important factors that could confer a specific role of a SNARE protein in targeting may include selective affinity of this t-SNARE for a specific non-SNARE in the vesicle and segregation of the target SNARE to a single membrane domain (apical). Consistent with this kind of targeting scheme is the hypothesis that the renal acid secretory vesicles are targeted, in part, by an interaction between an apical membrane syntaxin and the vesicular coating protein, the H+-ATPase. To test this hypothesis we initially examined the ability of fusion GST-syntaxin isoforms to form complexes with v-SNAREs and H+-ATPase derived from detergent (Triton-X-100)-solubilized extracts from the renal medulla of rats. The isoforms of syntaxin evaluated (syntaxin-1A, -1B, -2, -4, and -5) included only the syntaxins that are expressed by rat kidney and present in the apical membrane of intact tubular epithelial cells with the exception of syntaxin-5, a non-plasma membrane syntaxin that served as a control for these assays (10Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Syntaxin 3 which is also expressed in the plasma membrane of renal epithelial cells was not evaluated because it has been shown to be localized to only the basolateral membrane of renal tubular epithelial cells of the collecting duct (20Breton S. Inoue T. Knepper M.A. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F523-F529Google Scholar). In the pull-down assay, utilizing these GST syntaxins bound to Sepharose beads, we demonstrated isoform specificity in that only syntaxin-1 (1A >> 1B) bound both V1 and Vo H+-ATPase subunits, whereas all the other isoforms (syntaxin-2, -4, and -5) did not. All syntaxin isoforms examined bound VAMP and SNAP-23. Thus, the interaction between the proton pump and syntaxin appears not to be mediated by the binding of the proton pump to the other SNAREs that form the fusion complex. Paring of syntaxin-1 with H+-ATPase is direct and a likely process for targeting these vesicles to the apical membrane. To identify the region of syntaxin involved in binding to H+-ATPase, we determined whether the proton pump could be bound by truncated forms of syntaxin-1A. Truncation of the C-terminal membrane-binding region did not alter the binding characteristics for H+-ATPase or other SNAREs. On the other hand, deletion of the H3-SNARE binding domain abolished not only VAMP and SNAP-23 binding but also H+-ATPase binding. It would appear that the proton pump interacts with the same general region of syntaxin-1A as do other SNAREs but does not attach indirectly to syntaxin through VAMP or SNAP-23. These in vitro studies also are consistent with the view that there is syntaxin isoform specificity in the process of exocytic insertion of proton pumps into the apical membrane. To evaluate this proposal in an in vivo system, we examined the effect of expressing constructs of syntaxin in cultured IMCD cells on apical membrane H+-ATPase amplification. We developed cell lines that express truncated forms of syntaxin-1A and syntaxin-4 that had deletions of the membrane binding domain but not the SNARE binding domain. These cells expressed a soluble form of syntaxin (Fig. 4). We also generated a line that overexpressed full-length syntaxin-1A, a form that was primarily membrane-bound. Finally, we generated a cell line that expressed a form of syntaxin-1A that had truncations for both the membrane binding and SNARE binding domains. Based on the results of the pull-down assay, we predicted that the only truncation form of syntaxin that could act as an inhibitor of exocytosis of the proton pump would be the form that could bind to H+-ATPase but would not be localized to the plasma membrane (synt-1AΔC). Our results confirmed this prediction because only the expression of synt-1AΔC but not other forms (synt-1AΔCΔH3 or synt-4ΔC) resulted in an appreciable inhibition of H+-ATPase exocytosis. We also have demonstrated that synt-1AΔC but not synt-4ΔC co-immunoprecipitates with H+-ATPase. This observation indicates that these two molecules also interact in vivo. Finally, we have shown that syntaxin-1A is primarily distributed to the apical membrane of cultured IMCD cells. This series of observations is consistent with the hypothesis that interaction between the isoform of syntaxin, syntaxin-1A, and the H+-ATPase is specifically required for the targeting and fusion of proton pump laden vesicles with the apical membrane Although there is compelling evidence in our cultured IMCD cell line (4Banerjee A. Shih T. Alexander E.A. Schwartz J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26518-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and in non-renal tissue (21Breton S. Nsumu N.N. Galli T. Sabolic I. Smith P.J. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F717-F725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for a role for SNAREs in fusion targeting of H+-ATPases to the plasma membrane, to date there has been little evidence that indicates that SNAREs regulate exocytic insertion of the proton pump in the intact nephron. In the present study we demonstrate that the rat renal medulla expresses all of the constituents necessary to form fusion complexes. In addition the proteins derived from renal medullary homogenates interact with GST-syntaxin-1A and form a complex that has the same constituents that are observed in cultured IMCD cells when H+-ATPase exocytosis is stimulated. Therefore, we predict that as in the cultured cell model system, in the intact nephron, targeting of proton pumps involves the same set of SNAREs and has the same isoform specificity for syntaxin-1A as in the IMCD cell in culture. We thank Dr. Dennis Brown for the gift of rabbit antibody to the 31-kDa subunit H+-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1976477473,"Apart from its function as an initiator of DNA replication, the Escherichia coli DnaA protein is also a specific transcription factor. It activates and represses a number of promoters. However, mechanisms of transcription stimulation by DnaA remained unknown. Bacteriophage λ pR promoter is one of the promoters activated by DnaA. It was reported previously that DnaA binds downstream of the pR promoter and perhaps interacts with the RNA polymerase β subunit. Here we demonstrate that DnaA positively regulates transcription from pR by stimulation of two steps in transcription initiation: RNA polymerase binding to the promoter region and promoter escape. For this transcription activation, two weak DnaA boxes located downstream of pR are necessary and sufficient. Such a mechanism of transcription activation and location of the activator-binding sites relative to the transcription start point are unusual in prokaryotes. Changes in the distance between the transcription start point and the first DnaA box by 5 and 10 bp and alterations in the orientation of these boxes did not abolish the stimulation of transcription by DnaA, but the efficiency of the promoter activation was different for various mutations. It seems plausible that formation of higher order nucleoprotein structures, involving DNA looping, is necessary for effective stimulation of the pR promoter. At high concentrations, DnaA is a repressor of pR rather than an activator. This repression was found to be because of inhibition of RNA polymerase binding to the promoter region."

Targeting the appropriate cell type is a major challenge in cancer and cell therapy. Integrins, a family of cell receptors for plasma proteins, extracellular matrix proteins, and cell surface ligands (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar, 2Hynes R.O. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 3Hynes R.O. Wagner D.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2193-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), are potential targets for this purpose, because they are expressed by all cell types and are involved in many physiological functions including cell adhesion, proliferation, or differentiation, and pathological processes such as metastasis invasion, abnormal angiogenesis and vascularization, or thrombosis (4Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). In mammals, 18 α and eight β subunits assemble into 24 different non-covalent αβ heterodimers that mediate bidirectional signals through the cell membrane. In response to cell activation, “inside-out” signals control the level of binding affinity for the ligand. In turn, ligand binding induces rearrangements in integrin structure that trigger “outside-in” signaling pathways (5Plow E.F. Haas T.A. Zhang L. Loftus J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Extensive cross-talk also takes place between integrin and growth factor receptor signaling pathways (6Danen E.H. Yamada K.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 7Yamada K.M. Even-Ram S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E75-E76Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), influencing most integrin functions. The β1 integrin subset, comprising the major fibronectin receptor α5β1, is the most widely expressed. The β3 subset includes the fibrinogen receptor αIIbβ3, present on platelets and megakaryocytes, and αvβ3, originally described as the vitronectin receptor, which also binds a variety of matrix proteins including fibronectin and fibrinogen. Integrin αvβ3 is expressed on vascular cells during angiogenesis (8Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 741-750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1227-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) and is also present in the adult on activated leukocytes, osteoclasts, and macrophages, where it participates in bone resorption and ingestion of apoptotic cells. The expression of various integrins has been shown to be deregulated in a number of cancer cells and invasive tumors and is thought to participate in the malignancy phenotypes (10Mizejewski G.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 11Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin.

Thus, a decreased expression of α5β1 appears to increase the degree of tumorigenicity. In contrast, the level of αvβ3 is correlated with the survival and metastatic activity of tumor cells (10Mizejewski G.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 15Pecheur I. Peyruchaud O. Serre C.M. Guglielmi J. Voland C. Bourre F. Margue C. Cohen-Solal M. Buffet A. Kieffer N. Clezardin P.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Integrins, particularly αvβ3, are therefore considered as appropriate targets for cancer therapy. Intracellular drug or DNA delivery by integrin-targeted vectors has been shown to use the endocytic pathway (16Colin M. Maurice M. Trugnan G. Kornprobst M. Harbottle R.P. Knight A. Cooper R.G. Miller A.D. Capeau J. Coutelle C. Brahimi-Horn M.C. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Many integrins, particularly α5β1 and αvβ3, recognize the RGD motif as the critical determinant in their ligands (17Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Cell. 1986; 44: 517-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). The structural basis of this interaction has been documented recently (18Xiong J.P. Stehle T.

Among the natural ligands of integrins, disintegrins (20Gould R.J. Polokoff M.A. Friedman P.A. Huang T.F. Holt J.C. Cook J.J. Niewiarowski S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 83-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), are potent inhibitors of integrin function. They block platelet aggregation through interaction with αIIbβ3 and also inhibit αvβ3 and α5β1 functions. Disintegrins are cysteine-rich peptides of 48–84 amino acid residues, and their activities are directly related to the presence of an RGD or a related sequence in a large flexible loop (23Saudek V. Atkinson R.A. Lepage P. Pelton J.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Blobel C.P. White J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and mimic natural integrin ligands such as fibronectin, fibrinogen, or vitronectin. Integrin-targeted molecules developed in the recent years include antibodies, cyclic peptides, peptidomimetics, viruses, and small molecules (25Parkes R.J. Hart S.L. Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev. 2000; 44: 135-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). With the aim to develop a molecule able to interact with high affinity with integrins, we chose to introduce the critical RGD sequence in a stable, structurally compatible small protein scaffold. The EGF 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; Trx, thioredoxin; HSQC, 1H-detected heteronuclear single-quantum coherence; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; D-RGDW, the RGDW peptide with the d-isomer of arginine.-like module of human complement protease C1r appeared as a good candidate for this purpose, because it is stabilized by three disulfide bridges and features a large, structurally independent, and mobile loop between its first two cysteine residues (26Hernandez J.F.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1204-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A further advantage of EGF-like modules is their natural ability to associate with a variety of other module types, as seen in many natural proteins (28Campbell I.D. Bork P. Curr. Opin. Struc. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 29Bork P. Downing A.K. Kieffer B. Campbell I.D. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 119-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which opens the possibility of designing multimodular chimeric proteins. In a previous study (30Vella F. Hernandez J.F. Molla A. Block M.R. Arlaud G.J. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 54: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we showed, using chemical synthesis, that insertion of the GRGDSP motif of fibronectin into the human C1r EGF module resulted in a chimeric molecule with the ability to mediate attachment of CHO cells expressing the β1 class of integrins. In the present study we describe an efficient bacterial expression system that allows high yield production of chimeric EGF-like modules. This strategy was applied to the production of two modules, including a new variant designed to mimic the RGD-containing domain of disintegrins. Functional characterization of the recombinant modules by various methods including cell adhesion and surface plasmon resonance analysis indicates preferential binding to β3 integrins, whereas NMR spectroscopy provides insights into the structural basis of their relative binding efficiency. The cell lines CHO (ATCC number CCL-61), β3-CHO, and αIIbβ3-CHO (stably established by transfection with human megakaryocyte β3 and/or αIIb cDNA (31Frachet P. Uzan G. Thevenon D. Denarier E. Prandini M.H. Marguerie G. Mol. Biol.

The medium was supplemented with 800 μg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen) when necessary. Peptides D-RGDW and RGES were supplied by M.-H. Charon (Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique, Grenoble, France). Polyclonal anti-αv antibodies (AB1930) were from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Polyclonal anti-C1r antibodies recognizing native human C1r were raised in rabbits (32Arlaud G.J. Reboul A. Meyer C.M. Colomb M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 485: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Integrins αvβ3 from human placenta and α5β1 from human smooth muscle and placenta tissue were purchased from Chemicon in the octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside formulation. The purity and integrity of each integrin sample were checked by SDS-PAGE analysis. Cloning—The cDNA sequence coding for the human C1r EGF module was amplified by PCR using the complete C1r cDNA (33Journet A. Tosi M. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) as a template. A NdeI site and codons for the amino acid sequence IEGR (factor Xa cleavage site) were introduced at the 5′ end. The 3′ end consisted of a stop codon and an EcoRI site. The PCR product was then ligated to the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the pET 28b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The codons for the GRGDSP amino acid sequence were then introduced by the PCR overlap extension method (34Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar, 35Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar) to produce the EGF-RGD and V2 modules (see Fig. 1). A SacII restriction site was introduced into the PCR primers to allow mutation screening. The NcoI/XhoI fragments isolated from the pET28b recombinant plasmids were then introduced into the same sites of the linearized pET32a vector (Novagen). The resulting vectors, pET32-C1r EGF, pET32-EGF-RGD, and pET32-V2 predicted a protein containing the 109 amino acids of thioredoxin A, a thrombin cleavage site, a first histidine tag, an enterokinase cleavage site, a second histidine tag, and a factor Xa cleavage site, followed by the EGF module sequence (C1r EGF, EGF-RGD, or V2). The constructs were checked by double-stranded DNA sequencing (Genome Express, Meylan, France). Protein Expression and Isolation—Recombinant pET32 vectors were introduced by transformation into Escherichia coli BL21trxB(DE3) (Novagen), and bacteria were cultured at 37 °C in a Luria-Bertani medium to an A595 of 0.4. Protein production was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for5hat37 °C. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 1/25 culture volume of 20 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, containing an anti-protease mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), sonicated, and then centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The clarified fraction was added to a histidine-binding nickel-Sepharose Fast Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences) packed in an Econo-Pack column (Bio-Rad). After extensive washing with 50 mm imidazole, 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, elution was achieved by 100–500 mm imidazole solutions in the same buffer. The eluted samples were pooled and dialyzed against 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and freeze-dried. For production of recombinant modules isotopically labeled with 15N, freshly transformed bacteria were grown in an M9 minimal medium complemented with 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl, 4 g/liter glucose and supplemented with 0.1 mm MnCl2, 0.05 mm ZnCl2, 0.05 mm FeCl3, and a vitamin solution according to Jansson et al. (36Jansson M. Li Y.C. Jendeberg L. Anderson S. Montelione B.T. Nilsson B. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The recombinant EGF modules were released from thioredoxin by digestion of the fusion proteins (10 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0) with factor Xa (1 units/50 μg) for 16 h at 25 °C. The cleavage mixture was then analyzed and purified by reverse-phase HPLC using an analytical (0.46 × 25 cm) or a semi-preparative (2.2 × 25 cm) Vydac C18 column as described previously (30Vella F. Hernandez J.F. Molla A. Block M.R. Arlaud G.J. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 54: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Fractions were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry, and the purified material was controlled by N-terminal sequence analysis (30Vella F. Hernandez J.F. Molla A. Block M.R. Arlaud G.J. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 54: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The chimeric EGF modules were freeze-dried and stored at 4 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance measurement at 280 nm using molar extinction coefficients of 18,260 m–1 cm–1 for Trx module fusions and of 4,200 m–1 cm–1 for the cleaved modules. Adhesion assays were performed in plastic microtitration plates (Nunc, Inc.). Wells were coated overnight at 4 °C with the recombinant protein modules (1–100 μg/ml in PBS) or fibronectin (BD Biosciences) (25 μg/ml in PBS), and free binding sites were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin. Cells were harvested at 60–80% of confluence using trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and then allowed to attach for 1 h at 37 °C using 5 × 105 cells in 100 μl of medium/well. Non-adherent cells were removed by three washes in PBS, and the amount of attached cells was determined using a cell quantification kit by adding 20 μl of MTS reagent (Promega) to each well. After color development, plates were read on a Dynatech reader at 490 nm. Assays were run in triplicate, and nonspecific attachment to BSA alone (less than 5% of total adhesion) was subtracted from all measurements. Control experiments done with the Trx-C1r EGF or C1r EGF constructs showed no significant adhesion. For inhibition experiments, competitors at various concentrations were preincubated with the cells for 15 min at 4 °C before attachment. For inhibition by the soluble V2 module, fibrinogen (Stago, Asnieres, France) and fibronectin were used at concentrations yielding half-maximal adhesion, namely 5 and 16 μg/ml, respectively. Glass slides were coated overnight at 4 °C with fibronectin (25 μg/ml) or the EGF-RGD and V2 modules (100 μg/ml) and then coated with 3% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C. Harvested cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with serum and then plated onto the coated slides for 2 h at 37 °C. After the incubation period, cells were fixed for 10 min in PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde and 2% saccharose and then permeabilized for 20 min in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 (w/v). After three washes in PBS, actin staining was performed using rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Sigma). All incubations were performed at room temperature. Stained cells were observed under a laser confocal fluorescence microscope (Leica). Polylysine (70 μg/ml) was used as a negative control for stress fiber formation. Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed using a BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The running buffer for protein immobilization was 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The recombinant EGF-RGD and V2 modules were diluted to 200–400 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and immobilized onto the carboxymethylated dextran surface of a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore AB) using the amine coupling chemistry (BIAcore AB amine coupling kit). Binding of the purified αvβ3 and α5β1 integrins was measured over 2,500 resonance units of immobilized EGF-RGD and 1,400 resonance units of immobilized V2 at a flow rate of 20 μl/min in the running buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm CaCl2,1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside). This buffer was identical to that of the purchased integrins, including divalent cations and detergent, to avoid sample modification. Regeneration of the surfaces was achieved by injection of 10 μl of a 10 mm solution of the D-RGDW peptide. The specific binding signal shown was obtained by subtracting the background signal, routinely obtained by injection of the protein sample over an activated-deactivated surface. Immobilized bovine serum albumin or the unmodified C1r EGF module (30Vella F. Hernandez J.F. Molla A. Block M.R. Arlaud G.J. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 54: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) showed no integrin binding. The data were analyzed by global fitting to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model of both the association and dissociation phases for several concentrations simultaneously, using the BIAevaluation 3.2 software (BIAcore AB). The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were calculated from the ratio of the dissociation and association rate constants (koff/kon). The data presented for both αvβ3 and α5β1 correspond to a representative series of binding studies performed on the same sensor chip. In each case, similar results were reproduced from at least three independent experiments, using different integrin batches and different sensor chips. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed as described by Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis and immunochemical detection of the recombinant proteins were carried out as described by Rossi et al. (38Rossi V. Bally I. Thielens N.M. Esser A.F. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1232-1239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Chemiluminescence revelation was performed using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) and an anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The EGF-RGD and V2 modules were dissolved at a final concentration of ∼1 mm in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.7, containing 10% D2O. All NMR experiments were acquired on Varian INOVA 400 and 800 spectrometers. For the assignment of the amide proton and nitrogen chemical shifts, 15N-edited HSQC and three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC experiments, as well as two-dimensional, 15N-decoupled TOCSY and NOESY experiments were acquired at 800 MHz. TOCSY and NOESY mixing times were 70 and 150 ms, respectively. All chemical shifts were referenced with respect to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt using the 1H/15N frequency ratio of the zero point of 0.101329118 according to Markley et al. (39Markley J.L. Bax A. Arata Y. Hilbers C.W. Kaptein R. Sykes B.D. Wright P.E. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 933-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Relaxation measurements were performed at 400 Mhz. The 15N heteronuclear R1 and R1ρ relaxation rates and the {1H}-15N NOE were measured using standard pulse sequences (40Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional 1H-15N correlation spectra were acquired with 1024 (1H) and 100 (15N) complex points and 16 (R1 and R1ρ) or 64 scans ({1H}-15N NOE) per t1 increment. The relaxation-caused magnetization delay was sampled at nine different time points for R1 (0.014, 0.072, 0.131, 0.189, 0.248, 0.306, 0.393, 0.466, and 0.598 s) and seven time points for R1ρ (0.008, 0.04, 0.072, 0.104, 0.136, 0.168, and 0.2 s). The first time point was repeated at the end to check for sample and measurement stability and to evaluate experimental errors. For the steady-state {1H}-15N NOE measurements, two spectra were acquired with and without proton saturation in an interleaved manner. The recycle delays were set to 1 s (R1 and R1ρ) and 5 s ({1H}-15N NOE). Data processing and peak picking were performed using the FELIX 2000 software (Accelrys Inc.). The 15N R1 and R1ρ relaxation rates were determined from peak intensities rather than from peak volumes, using a non-linear least-squares fit to a two-parameter single exponential function I(t) = I(0)exp(Rt), where I(t) is the peak intensity after a relaxation delay of time t, and I(0) is the initial peak intensity. Uncertainties in the resulting R1 and R1ρ values were estimated by Monte-Carlo simulations with 1000 random Gaussian noise iterations, taking into account the experimental noise from the spectra. The transverse relaxation rate constants R2 were calculated from R1ρ rate constants using the relation, R1ρ = cos2(θ)R2 + sin2(θ)R1, where θ = tan–1(2πΔν/γNB1), and Δν is the frequency difference between the 15N carrier and the frequency of the observed nitrogen. The steady-state heteronuclear NOE were determined from the ratio of the peak intensities measured in experiments acquired with and without proton saturation. Cells were lysed on the culture plate for1hat4 °C in PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and an anti-protease mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cell extract was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Proteins were quantified using a micro BCA assay (Pierce). Fractions of the cell extract, containing 1 mg of total proteins, were incubated for 2.5 h at room temperature with an equal volume of a nickel-Sepharose-Trx module resin prepared by mixing 1 mg of Trx module fusion protein with 400 μl of chelating Sepharose. After extensive washes using PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20, bound proteins were recovered by elution with 1 ml of PBS containing 10 mm EDTA and 50 mm NaCl. Following trichloroacetic acid precipitation, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and Western blotting using anti-αv antibodies and chemiluminescence detection. Engineering, Production, and Biochemical Characterization of Recombinant EGF-RGD Modules—Our previous data based on a synthetic EGF-RGD module (30Vella F. Hernandez J.F. Molla A. Block M.R. Arlaud G.J. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 54: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) led us to develop a recombinant strategy to overproduce the original module and a variant designed to mimic the structure of disintegrins (Fig. 1A). Based on the alignment of the RGD-containing loop of the EGF-RGD module with the consensus sequence of the corresponding region of disintegrins (Fig. 1B), a variant termed V2 was designed by shortening the loop to the same length as in disintegrins. To produce soluble and well folded recombinant proteins we chose the pET 32/E. coli BL21 Trx B (DE3) system, which uses thioredoxin (TrxA) as a gene fusion partner. As shown in Fig. 1B, a factor Xa cleavage site was introduced between the fusion protein and the EGF module. As illustrated in the case of Trx-EGF-RGD, both fusion proteins were overproduced after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Fig. 2A). Purification was carried out from clarified lysates obtained after sonication of the cell pellets. The Trx-EGF-RGD and Trx-V2 fusion proteins bound to nickel-Sepharose columns and were subsequently eluted using 200–300 mm imidazole (Fig. 2B). Western blotting realized on the different fractions using polyclonal anti-C1r antibodies revealed a major band of around 30 kDa in both cases (Fig. 2C), consistent with the calculated values (25,508.2 Da for Trx-EGF-RGD and 25,264.9 Da for Trx-V2). Two bands of about 66 and 94 kDa were observed in each case, likely corresponding to dimeric and trimeric forms of the recombinant proteins. Cleavage with factor Xa efficiently released the recombinant EGF modules from thioredoxin. The isolated modules were then purified to homogeneity by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 2D), and their disulfide bridges were checked by peptide mapping as described previously (30Vella F. Hernandez J.F. Molla A. Block M.R. Arlaud G.J. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 54: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), establishing a Cys1-Cys3, Cys2-Cys4, Cys5-Cys6 pattern characteristic of EGF-like modules (28Campbell I.D. Bork P. Curr. Opin. Struc. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Analysis by electrospray mass spectrometry confirmed the identity and homogeneity of the recombinant EGF-RGD and V2 modules, yielding reconstructed molecular masses of 5,627.35 ± 0.53 and 5,384.59 ± 0.53 Da, respectively, consistent with the calculated values (5,628.0 and 5,384.8 Da, respectively). The yields obtained were routinely 50–70 mg per liter of culture for the Trx fusion proteins, resulting in 2–4 mg of the HPLC-purified isolated modules. EGF-RGD Modules Promote Cell Adhesion of CHO Cell Lines Expressing β1and β3Integrins—To evaluate the ability of the chimeric EGF modules to promote integrin-mediated cell adhesion, we used a panel of related CHO cell lines expressing different integrins. Wild-type CHO cells express α5β1 as a major integrin and do not express β3 or β2 integrins; β3-CHO cells produce a hybrid (hamster/human) αv/β3 heterodimer; αIIbβ3-CHO (31Frachet P. Uzan G.
