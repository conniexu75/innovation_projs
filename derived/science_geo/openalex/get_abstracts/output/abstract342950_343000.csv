https://openalex.org/W2095001466,"Recent experience has shown that certain metal alloys can be put into glass form by rapid melt-quenching or by various condensation processes. Models for the nature and structure of these glasses are surveyed and shown to be quite parallel to those already developed for the more common nonmetallic glasses. The rather unique magnetic, superconducting, and mechanical properties and the technical potential of metallic glasses are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2068828617,"A reflectance spectrum of Phobos (from 200 to 1100 nanometers) has been compiled from the Mariner 9 ultraviolet spectrometer, Viking lander imaging, and ground-based photometric data. The reflectance of the martian satellite is approximately constant at 5 percent from 1100 to 400 nanometers but drops sharply below 400 nanometers, reaching a value of 1 percent at 200 nanometers. The spectral albedo of Phobos bears a striking resemblance to that of asteroids (1) Ceres and (2) Pallas. Comparison of the reflectance spectra of asteroids with those of meteorites has shown that the spectral signature of Ceres is indicative of a carbonaceous chondritic composition. A physical explanation of how the compositional information is imposed on the reflectance spectrum is given. On the basis of a good match between the reflectance spectra of Phobos and Ceres and the extensive research that has been done to infer the composition of Ceres, it seems reasonable to believe that the surface composition of Phobos is similar to that of carbonaceous chondrites. This suggestion is consistent with the recently determined low density of Mars's inner satellite. Our result and recent Viking noble gas measurements suggest different modes of origin for Mars and Phobos."
https://openalex.org/W2134706223,"During the last 2 weeks of February 1977, an intensive scientific investigation of the martian satellite Phobos was conducted by the Viking Orbiter-1 (VO-1) spacecraft. More than 125 television pictures were obtained during this period and infrared observations were made. About 80 percent of the illuminated hemisphere was imaged at a resolution of about 30 meters. Higher resolution images of limited areas were also obtained. Flyby distances within 80 kilometers of the surface were achieved. An estimate of the mass of Phobos (GM) was obtained by observing the effect of Phobos's gravity on the orbit of VO-1 as sensed by Earth-based radiometric tracking. Preliminary results indicate a value of GM of 0.00066 ± 0.00012 cubic kilometer per second squared (standard deviation of 3) and a mean density of about 1.9 ± 0.6 gram per cubic centimeter (standard deviation of 3). This low density, together with the low albedo and the recently determined spectral reflectance, suggest that Phobos is compositionally similar to type I carbonaceous chondrites. Thus, either this object formed in the outer part of the asteroid belt or Lewis's theory that such material cannot condense at 1.5 astronomical units is incorrect. The data on Phobos obtained during this first encounter period are comparable in quantity to all of the data on Mars returned by Mariner flights 4, 6, and 7."

https://openalex.org/W1967449436,"THE announcement of Bateson ('94), that the whole range of natural history there is no more striking case of the discontinuity and perfection of meristic variation than in the genus Sarsia, and the further proposition whether it is a mere coincidence that the specimens presenting this variation, so rare among the free-swimming Hydromedusae, should have been members of the same directed my attention to this particular problem in conjunction with work upon this group of coelenterates which had engaged my attention for several years. During the following years, therefore, collections of free medusae of several genera were made with a view to testing the problem raised by this observer. While as yet these collections are not extensive, except in a few genera, certain facts have been secured which may not be without value in their general bearing upon this as well as still broader problems of variation in general. My collections have been restricted chiefly to the genera Eucope, Obelia, Margelis, Pennaria, Gonionemus, Coryne (Sarsia), and Hybocodon; the specimens of several others have been casually examined. Of the genera named, Obelia has not as yet been examined in sufficient numbers and detail to warrant any specific mention in this connection. And since these observations have been under way a paper by Agassiz and Woodworth ('96) on (Some Variations in the Genus Eucope has appeared which so fully covers the facts involved in members of that genus, and are so coincident with my own, that no special details will be offered in connection with it, though the materials at hand are more abundant than upon any of the others."
