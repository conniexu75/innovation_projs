Here, we report that growing microtubule plus ends decorated by the microtubule tip-tracking protein EB3 enter spines and can modulate spine morphology. We describe p140Cap/SNIP, a regulator of Src tyrosine kinase, as an EB3 interacting partner that is predominantly localized to spines and enriched in the postsynaptic density. Inhibition of microtubule dynamics, or knockdown of either EB3 or p140Cap, modulates spine shape via regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching revealed that EB3-binding is required for p140Cap accumulation within spines. In addition, we found that p140Cap interacts with Src substrate and F-actin-binding protein cortactin. We propose that EB3-labeled growing microtubule ends regulate the localization of p140Cap, control cortactin function, and modulate actin dynamics within dendritic spines, thus linking dynamic microtubules to spine changes and synaptic plasticity."

Yet, available estimates of the size of this region are highly disparate, ranging from several hundred microns to a few millimeters. To measure the size of this region directly, we used a combination of multielectrode recordings and optical imaging. We determined the orientation selectivity of stimulus-evoked LFP signals in primary visual cortex and were able to predict it on the basis of the surrounding map of orientation preference. The results show that > 95% of the LFP signal originates within 250 microm of the recording electrode. This quantitative estimate indicates that LFPs are more local than often recognized and provides a guide to the interpretation of the increasing number of studies that rest on LFP recordings."

Their elementary excitations, polaritons-mixtures of excitons and photons-can accumulate in macroscopically degenerate states to form various types of condensate in a wide range of experimental configurations, under either incoherent or coherent excitation. Condensates of polaritons have been put forward as candidates for superfluidity, and the formation of vortices as well as elementary excitations with linear dispersion are actively sought as evidence to support this. Here, using a coherent excitation triggered by a short optical pulse, we have created and set in motion a macroscopically degenerate state of polaritons that can be made to collide with a variety of defects present in the microcavity. Our experiments show striking manifestations of a coherent light-matter packet, travelling at high speed (of the order of one per cent of the speed of light) and displaying collective dynamics consistent with superfluidity, although one of a highly unusual character as it involves an out-of-equilibrium dissipative system. Our main results are the observation of a linear polariton dispersion accompanied by diffusionless motion; flow without resistance when crossing an obstacle; suppression of Rayleigh scattering; and splitting into two fluids when the size of the obstacle is comparable to the size of the wave packet. This work opens the way to the investigation of new phenomenology of out-of-equilibrium condensates."

Here we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, that conformity is based on mechanisms that comply with principles of reinforcement learning. We found that individual judgments of facial attractiveness are adjusted in line with group opinion. Conflict with group opinion triggered a neuronal response in the rostral cingulate zone and the ventral striatum similar to the “prediction error” signal suggested by neuroscientific models of reinforcement learning. The amplitude of the conflict-related signal predicted subsequent conforming behavioral adjustments. Furthermore, the individual amplitude of the conflict-related signal in the ventral striatum correlated with differences in conforming behavior across subjects. These findings provide evidence that social group norms evoke conformity via learning mechanisms reflected in the activity of the rostral cingulate zone and ventral striatum.

These findings provide evidence that social group norms evoke conformity via learning mechanisms reflected in the activity of the rostral cingulate zone and ventral striatum. Human behavior is guided not only by subjective values or attitudes, but also by the perceived behavior of others, in particular by social norms (Cialdini and Goldstein, 2004Cialdini R.B. Goldstein N.J. Social influence: compliance and conformity.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2004; 55: 591-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). Despite a growing body of literature describing neural mechanisms of decision making (Montague et al., 2006Montague P.R. King-Casas B. Cohen J.D. Imaging valuation models in human choice.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 417-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, Spitzer et al., 2007Spitzer M. Fischbacher U. Herrnberger B. Gron G. Fehr E. The neural signature of social norm compliance.Neuron. 2007; 56: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), we know little about how and why such social influence on human decisions occurs. Conformity refers to the act of changing one's behavior to match the responses of others (Cialdini and Goldstein, 2004Cialdini R.B. Goldstein N.J. Social influence: compliance and conformity.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2004; 55: 591-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). The behavior and judgment of other people provides information on the normal and expected behavior in these circumstances and what is typically approved or disapproved. The effect of group opinion on individual judgments and decisions have been robustly replicated (Cialdini and Goldstein, 2004Cialdini R.B. Goldstein N.J. Social influence: compliance and conformity.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2004; 55: 591-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar) since Solomon Asch's pioneering work on the line-judgment conformity experiments in which a third of the participants conformed to the erroneous majority opinion of the confederates, even when the majority claimed that two lines different in length by several inches were the same length (Asch, 1951Asch S. Effects of group pressure upon the modification and distortion of judgments.in: Guetzkow H. Groups, Leadership and Men Research in Human Relations. Carnegie Press, Pittsburgh1951: 177-190Google Scholar). Conformity has been extensively studied in social psychology, and three central motivations for conforming behavior are suggested: a desire to be accurate by properly interpreting reality and behaving correctly, to obtain social approval from others, and to maintain a favorable self-concept (Cialdini and Goldstein, 2004Cialdini R.B. Goldstein N.J. Social influence: compliance and conformity.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2004; 55: 591-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). Whereas psychological studies emphasize the rewarding value of social approval or affiliation with others (Cialdini and Goldstein, 2004Cialdini R.B. Goldstein N.J. Social influence: compliance and conformity.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2004; 55: 591-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar), behavioral economics focuses more on the effects of punishment for violation of the norm (Fehr and Fischbacher, 2004Fehr E. Fischbacher U. Third-party punishment and social norms.Evol. Hum. Behav. 2004; 25: 63-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). In fact, both approaches may suggest that conformity is underlined by reinforcement learning, i.e., social norms selectively reinforce certain behaviors. Here, we utilize the cognitive neuroscience approach (Phelps and LeDoux, 2005Phelps E.A. LeDoux J.E. Contributions of the amygdala to emotion processing: from animal models to human behavior.Neuron. 2005; 48: 175-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar) to provide a useful framework for studying reinforcement learning mechanisms of conformity. Recent neuroscientific and computational models assume that goal-directed behavior requires continuous performance monitoring (Montague et al., 2006Montague P.R. King-Casas B. Cohen J.D. Imaging valuation models in human choice.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 417-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Successful behavioral patterns are reinforced while errors call for adjustments of behavior. Many reinforcement learning models include a “prediction error”—a difference between the expected and obtained outcome (Schultz, 2006Schultz W. Behavioral theories and the neurophysiology of reward.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2006; 57: 87-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Reward prediction error guides decision making by signaling the need for adjustment of behavior. Importantly, a conflict with social norms is not a usual behavioral error, i.e., it is not a typical behavioral mistake but rather any action that deviates from the behavior of the majority. Conformity with social norms requires neural signals related to deviations from it (Montague and Lohrenz, 2007Montague P.R. Lohrenz T. To detect and correct: norm violations and their enforcement.Neuron. 2007; 56: 14-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here, we hypothesize that a perceived deviation from group norms triggers a neural response that is similar to prediction error in reinforcement learning—indicating a need to change individuals' future behavior in line with group norms. Event-related brain potential and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggest that the rostral cingulate zone (RCZ) has a specific role in reinforcement learning and generation of feedback- and error-related responses (Gehring et al., 1993Gehring W.J. Goss B. Coles M.G.H. Meyer D.E. Donchin E. A neural system for error detection and compensation.Psychol. Sci. 1993; 4: 385-390Crossref Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). The RCZ is the region on the border of Brodman areas 6, 8, 24, and 32 (Picard and Strick, 1996Picard N. Strick P.L. Motor areas of the medial wall: a review of their location and functional activation.Cereb. Cortex. 1996; 6: 342-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Cognitive neuroscience provides strong evidence to imply that activity of the RCZ, the region in the posterior medial frontal cortex, indicates the need for adjustments both when the action goal was not achieved and when the likelihood of failure is high (Cohen and Ranganath, 2007Cohen M.X. Ranganath C. Reinforcement learning signals predict future decisions.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, di Pellegrino et al., 2007di Pellegrino G. Ciaramelli E. Ladavas E. The regulation of cognitive control following rostral anterior cingulate cortex lesion in humans.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2007; 19: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, Ridderinkhof et al., 2004Ridderinkhof K.R. Ullsperger M. Crone E.A. Nieuwenhuis S. The role of the medial frontal cortex in cognitive control.Science. 2004; 306: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the RCZ activity has also been shown to predict the strength of subsequent behavioral adjustments during simple choice decisions (Cohen and Ranganath, 2007Cohen M.X. Ranganath C. Reinforcement learning signals predict future decisions.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, Kerns et al., 2004Kerns J.G. Cohen J.D. MacDonald 3rd, A.W. Cho R.Y. Stenger V.A. Carter C.S. Anterior cingulate conflict monitoring and adjustments in control.Science. 2004; 303: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). The reinforcement learning theory of performance monitoring suggests that the RCZ activity is modulated by a midbrain dopaminergic signal which indicates whether an action outcome is worse or better than expected, regardless of the primary cause of the deviation from the prediction (Holroyd and Coles, 2002Holroyd C.B. Coles M.G. The neural basis of human error processing: reinforcement learning, dopamine, and the error-related negativity.Psychol. Rev. 2002; 109: 679-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (2778) Google Scholar). The RCZ is not alone in monitoring behavioral outcomes. In fact, a growing body of research has identified a distributed neural network involved in this process which includes the ventral striatum, i.e., the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Indeed, unpredictable reward modulates the activity of the human NAc (Berns et al., 2001Berns G.S. McClure S.M. Pagnoni G. Montague P.R. Predictability modulates human brain response to reward.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2793-2798PubMed Google Scholar, McClure et al., 2003McClure S.M. Berns G.S. Montague P.R. Temporal prediction errors in a passive learning task activate human striatum.Neuron. 2003; 38: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, O'Doherty, 2004O'Doherty J.P. Reward representations and reward-related learning in the human brain: insights from neuroimaging.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). The NAc has also been implicated in social learning (Rilling et al., 2002Rilling J. Gutman D. Zeh T. Pagnoni G. Berns G. Kilts C. A neural basis for social cooperation.Neuron. 2002; 35: 395-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Overall, previous studies have demonstrated that the NAc is involved into gain prediction in response to reward cues (Knutson and Wimmer, 2007Knutson B. Wimmer G.E. Splitting the difference: how does the brain code reward episodes?.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2007; 1104: 54-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Importantly, the cell bodies of the majority of dopamine neurons that show an actual prediction error signal are located in the midbrain (substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area [Schultz, 2006Schultz W. Behavioral theories and the neurophysiology of reward.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2006; 57: 87-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar]). These midbrain neurons project heavily to the NAc and the RCZ. Thus, assuming that the BOLD signal may primarily reflect inputs (and local computation), it is possible that with human fMRI such a full prediction error signal would show up primarily in the NAc and the RCZ rather than in the midbrain where it originates. In the current study, we hypothesized that, if conformity is based on reinforcement learning, (1) a conflict with group opinion triggers a “prediction error” response manifested in activity of the RCZ and the NAc and (2) this activity predicts the subsequent adjustment of the behavior, i.e., social conformity. To test our hypothesis, we designed a paradigm in which the subject's initial judgments of facial attractiveness were open to influence by group opinion. Facial attractiveness is a highly important social characteristic (Langlois et al., 2000Langlois J.H. Kalakanis L. Rubenstein A.J. Larson A. Hallam M. Smoot M. Maxims or myths of beauty? A meta-analytic and theoretical review.Psychol. Bull. 2000; 126: 390-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar) and an everyday target of normative influence, for example by fashion magazines and cosmetics commercials. During fMRI (Experiment N1), female subjects rated the attractiveness of female faces, and after each rating they were informed of an “average European rating” of the face—group rating. Actual group ratings were systematically manipulated during the experiment. We assumed that group opinion (group ratings) signaled the normative opinion (a “descriptive norm” representing typical behavior [Cialdini and Goldstein, 2004Cialdini R.B. Goldstein N.J. Social influence: compliance and conformity.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2004; 55: 591-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar]) about the attractiveness of each individual face. Thus, with our procedure, we introduced a conflict between the subject's own judgment and the normative group opinion. To identify subsequent conformity with the group, subjects rated the same set of faces again after the fMRI session. To identify the neural activity related to “social (normative) conflict” we first compared the brain responses in all trials in which the group rating differed from the subject's rating (conflict trials) with all no-conflict trials. To model subsequent conformity effects, we then calculated a contrast within conflict trials: conflicts with group ratings followed by conformity (i.e., where perceived facial attractiveness subsequently changed in line with group ratings) versus conflicts with group ratings not followed by conformity (where perceived facial attractiveness did not change). We found that the perceived difference of individual ratings from group ratings triggered long-term conforming behavioral adjustments, i.e., subjects changed their attractiveness ratings to align them with group ratings. As we expected, a conflict with group opinion activated RCZ and deactivated the NAc, which implies that conflict with normative group opinion triggers neuronal signals similar to the prediction error signal of reinforcement learning. Subsequent conformity was predicted by the larger conflict-related responses. Conjunction analysis (testing the conjunction null hypothesis [Nichols et al., 2005Nichols T. Brett M. Andersson J. Wager T. Poline J.B. Valid conjunction inference with the minimum statistic.Neuroimage. 2005; 25: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar]) revealed a spatial overlap between the conflict-related activity and activity which predicted subsequent conformity. Furthermore, the individual strength of the conformity-related activity in the ventral striatum correlated with differences in conforming behavior across subjects. Finally, we conducted an fMRI control experiment (Experiment N2) to examine the social relevance of our results using a nonsocial version of the task in which group normative opinion was replaced with computer-generated ratings. We found that conforming behavior and related effects in the RCZ and the NAc were particularly strong in the social condition (Experiment N1). Overall, this data provides evidence that social conformity is based on mechanisms similar to reinforcement learning: a conflict with group opinion triggers a prediction error signal, indicating a need for adjustment of judgments, i.e., social conformity. Twenty-four female participants (three subjects were later excluded from the analysis, see Experimental Procedures) were invited to participate in a study investigating brain mechanisms of facial attractiveness. During fMRI participants rated the attractiveness of 222 female faces and after each rating they were informed about a group rating (“average European rating”) of the face (Figure 1). To test whether group opinion affected perceived facial attractiveness, subjects were unexpectedly asked to rate the faces again during a behavioral session approximately 30 min after scanning. This time faces were again presented in a random order, but without group ratings. In agreement with our expectations, participants changed their ratings of attractiveness, aligning themselves with group ratings (Figure 2): on average, participants decreased their attractiveness ratings when group ratings had been more negative than their own initial rating, whereas more positive group ratings were associated with more positive re-evaluation of faces. Participants did not change their ratings significantly if group ratings matched their initial ratings (no-conflict trials). One-way ANOVA analysis (three-level factor of group ratings) revealed a significant main effect of the factor group ratings on changes in attractiveness ratings (F(2,20) = 31.1 p = 0.0001). Therefore, group opinion effectively modulated judgments of individuals even when the group was not physically present and so could not directly affect participants. The conformity effect was especially strong for highly ambiguous faces: for faces whose initial ratings varied most across participants (standard deviation ≥1.621, see Supplemental Data, Figure S1 available online for details).Figure 2Mean Behavioral Conformity EffectsShow full captionOn average the attractiveness ratings changed in line with the group ratings.

The picture illustrates the change of the faces' attractiveness measured during the behavioral session as compared to the initial ratings during the fMRI session. Bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Given the fact that group ratings were often “more extreme” than participants' initial ratings, one may argue that the behavioral effect of conformity is simply caused by an increase in variance of the scale used, i.e., variation in ratings of faces is greater in the subsequent behavioral session than in the initial fMRI session. To exclude this simple “range” effect, we compared variances of ratings for the first (fMRI) session and the second (behavioral) session (see Figure S2). In contrast to the expectations of the “range” hypothesis, the variance slightly decreased in the second session (from 2.96 to 2.7, t(1,20) = 1.85, p = 0.08). Thus our behavioral finding can not be explained by a simple increase in response variance, but entails a true adjustment to group feedback (see Supplemental Data for detailed analyses). To establish an even closer relationship between group ratings and individual behavior, we performed a correlation analysis between the magnitude of the conflict (i.e., the difference value between subjects' own and group ratings during the fMRI session) and the subsequent change in the perceived facial attractiveness separately for each participant. We found a significant correlation among all participants (mean values: r = 0.21, n = 222, p = 0.005, SD = 0.06, min value: r = 0.13, max value: r = 0.33), except for one subject who showed a correlation that just failed to reach statistical significance (r = 0.126, p = 0.07). The larger the conflict with group opinion, the more pronounced the conformity effect was, even at the level of individual participants. We later used the individual correlation coefficients as conformity scores (i.e., a measure of the individual tendency to conform, thereby distinguishing conformists from nonconformists), and correlated them with individual fMRI conformity effects. Our study therefore revealed that conformity leads to the transmission of facial preferences from the group to the individual. Overall the behavioral results indicate that the manipulation of social normative influence was successful in inducing conformity effects in the judgment of facial attractiveness. To study brain activity associated with the perception of social conflict, we compared neural activity occurring during all trials in which the group rating conflicted with the subject's rating with all trials in which the group rating did not conflict with the subject's rating—the conflict contrast. As expected, the conflict with group opinion activated the RCZ (Figure 3A). The location of the cluster maximum (x = −3, y = 14, z = 48) matched closely the results of a previous meta-analysis on error monitoring (x = 1, y = 15, z = 43; for details see Ridderinkhof et al., 2004Ridderinkhof K.R. Ullsperger M. Crone E.A. Nieuwenhuis S. The role of the medial frontal cortex in cognitive control.Science. 2004; 306: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar). In addition, conflict trials activated more strongly than no-conflict trials (Table 1) the insular cortex, the precuneus, the cerebellar tonsil, and the middle frontal gyrus, all areas known to be engaged in general error processing (Diedrichsen et al., 2005Diedrichsen J. Hashambhoy Y. Rane T. Shadmehr R. Neural correlates of reach errors.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9919-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, Ridderinkhof et al., 2004Ridderinkhof K.R. Ullsperger M. Crone E.A. Nieuwenhuis S. The role of the medial frontal cortex in cognitive control.Science. 2004; 306: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the conflict deactivated (i.e., more activity for no-conflict than conflict trials) the ventral striatum (NAc) and the posterior cingulate cortex, brain areas that are known to be involved in reward processing and error detection (McCoy and Platt, 2005McCoy A.N. Platt M.L. Expectations and outcomes: decision-making in the primate brain.J. Comp. Physiol. A Neuroethol. Sens. Neural Behav.

Psychol. 2006; 57: 87-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Our results thus indicate that a mismatch with group opinion triggers a neural response in the RCZ and the NAc that is similar to prediction error signal.Table 1Significant Activation Clusters for Social Conflict ContrastBrain RegionHEMxyzNo. of VoxelsZActivationsRostral cingulate zone (RCZ): medial/superior frontal gyrus, cingulate gyrus BA 6/8/24/32L/R−314485915.26Precuneus, cuneus, BA 7/19L−20−69372333.94Precuneus, BA7/19R12−75459894.97Middle frontal gyrus, BA9L−36−3376664.61Middle frontal gyrus, BA9R3614238444.87CerebellumL−34−58−283574.30Insula, BA13L−411842764.22Insula, BA13R2716131493.92Middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, BA 6R29−3511494.19MidbrainR10−21−14523.66∗MidbrainL−3−15−3273.55∗MidbrainL/R3−27−3323.55∗DeactivationsPosterior cingulate gyrus, BA 31L/R0−38402404.32Middle/superior frontal gyrus, BA 6/8L−2418382064.24Ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens, caudate)L/R−616−51984.06Local maxima within these clusters are reported together with the number of voxels (No. of Voxels); BA, Brodmann area; HEM, hemisphere; L, left; R, right; x, y, z are Talairach coordinates of the local maximum; ∗ with small volume correction.

The posterior cingulate cortex has been implicated into the “default” network (Buckner et al., 2008Buckner R.L. Andrews-Hanna J.R. Schacter D.L. The brain's default network: anatomy, function, and relevance to disease.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2008; 1124: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (6181) Google Scholar)—a specific, anatomically defined brain system preferentially active when individuals are not focused on the external environment. The deactivation of the cingulate cortex in the current study could therefore indicate an additional cognitive demand triggered by the conflict with the group opinion. Interestingly, a recent study showed that the posterior cingulate cortex is affected by dopamine depletion (Nagano-Saito et al., 2008Nagano-Saito A. Leyton M. Monchi O. Goldberg Y.K. He Y. Dagher A. Dopamine depletion impairs frontostriatal functional connectivity during a set-shifting task.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3697-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Furthermore, animal studies have demonstrated that neurons of the posterior cingulate monitor the omission of expected reward, suggestive of a prediction error-like signal (see McCoy and Platt, 2005McCoy A.N. Platt M.L. Expectations and outcomes: decision-making in the primate brain.J. Comp. Physiol. A Neuroethol. Sens. Neural Behav. Physiol. 2005; 191: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, for a review). Prediction error signals are intimately associated with dopamine neurons in the midbrain (Schultz, 2006Schultz W. Behavioral theories and the neurophysiology of reward.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2006; 57: 87-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). We therefore conducted an ROI analysis in the midbrain dopaminergic region covering the entire area, including substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and other structures. The spherical ROI had a radius of 15 mm and was centered at the coordinate −1, −18, −9 (x, y, z) (Aron et al., 2004Aron A.R. Shohamy D. Clark J. Myers C. Gluck M.A. Poldrack R.A. Human midbrain sensitivity to cognitive feedback and uncertainty during classification learning.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We found significant clusters of activity in the midbrain triggered by conflict with the group opinion (see Table 1 and Figure S4) and no significant deactivations. The activity of the midbrain, the RCZ and the NAc could reflect a degree of the social conflict with normative group opinion or a degree of reward subjects experienced when their ratings matched the normative ratings in no-conflict trials. However, given the fact that no-conflict trials were not followed by behavioral changes we focused our further analysis on conflict trials that triggered conformity. Next, we hypothesized that the social conflict response in the RCZ and the NAc is predictive of changes in participants' opinions on facial attractiveness. The activation of the RCZ and deactivation of the NAc should therefore be particularly strong during those conflict trials that effectively changed subjects' opinion, i.e., were followed by conformity. To test this hypothesis, we compared brain activity during those conflict trials that were followed by changes in perceived attractiveness of faces in line with group ratings with conflict trials where there were no such changes—the conformity contrast. Indeed, the activation of the RCZ region of interest predicted subsequent conformity: the activity in the RCZ elicited by the conflicts with group opinion that were followed by conformity was stronger than that elicited by conflicts that were not followed by conformity (Figure 4A). Furthermore, the deactivation of the NAc region of interest during the perceived conflict with group opinion also predicted conformity (Figure 4B). In addition, we conducted a whole-brain analysis of conformity effects and found that the conformity-related suppression of activity in the NAc was significant, even without small volume correction. In the global search we found that conformity was also predicted by a deactivation of extrastriate visual cortex (BA 18,19) and parahippocampal cortices (Figure 4B; Table 2). We also checked conformity effects in the fusiform gyrus, a region implicated in face and attractiveness processing (Iaria et al., 2008Iaria G. Fox C.J. Waite C.T. Aharon I. Barton J.J. The contribution of the fusiform gyrus and superior temporal sulcus in processing facial attractiveness: Neuropsychological and neuroimaging evidence.Neuroscience. 2008; 155: 409-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2064945501,"Recent research has demonstrated that many swine and swine farmers in the Netherlands and Canada are colonized with MRSA. However, no studies to date have investigated carriage of MRSA among swine and swine farmers in the United States (U.S.).We sampled the nares of 299 swine and 20 workers from two different production systems in Iowa and Illinois, comprising approximately 87,000 live animals. MRSA isolates were typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using SmaI and EagI restriction enzymes, and by multi locus sequence typing (MLST). PCR was used to determine SCCmec type and presence of the pvl gene.In this pilot study, overall MRSA prevalence in swine was 49% (147/299) and 45% (9/20) in workers. The prevalence of MRSA carriage among production system A's swine varied by age, ranging from 36% (11/30) in adult swine to 100% (60/60) of animals aged 9 and 12 weeks. The prevalence among production system A's workers was 64% (9/14). MRSA was not isolated from production system B's swine or workers. Isolates examined were not typeable by PFGE when SmaI was used, but digestion with EagI revealed that the isolates were clonal and were not related to common human types in Iowa (USA100, USA300, and USA400). MLST documented that the isolates were ST398.These results show that colonization of swine by MRSA was very common on one swine production system in the midwestern U.S., suggesting that agricultural animals could become an important reservoir for this bacterium. MRSA strain ST398 was the only strain documented on this farm. Further studies are examining carriage rates on additional farms."
https://openalex.org/W1993547722,"Dendritic cells located at the body surfaces, e.g. skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, play an essential role in the induction of adaptive immune responses to pathogens and inert antigens present at these surfaces. In the respiratory tract, multiple subsets of dendritic cells (RDC) have been identified in both the normal and inflamed lungs. While the importance of RDC in antigen transport from the inflamed or infected respiratory tract to the lymph nodes draining this site is well recognized, the contribution of individual RDC subsets to this process and the precise role of migrant RDC within the lymph nodes in antigen presentation to T cells is not clear. In this report, we demonstrate that two distinct subsets of migrant RDC - exhibiting the CD103+ and CD11bhi phenotype, respectively - are the primary DC presenting antigen to naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the draining nodes in response to respiratory influenza virus infection. Furthermore, the migrant CD103+ RDC subset preferentially drives efficient proliferation and differentiation of naive CD8+ T cells responding to infection into effector cells, and only the CD103+ RDC subset can present to naïve CD8+ T cells non-infectious viral vaccine introduced into the respiratory tract. These results identify CD103+ and CD11bhi RDC as critical regulators of the adaptive immune response to respiratory tract infection and potential targets in the design of mucosal vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1575429982,"A pairing gap and coherence are the two hallmarks of superconductivity. In a classical BCS (Bardeen–Cooper–Schreiffer) superconductor they are established simultaneously at the critical temperature, Tc. In the cuprates however, an energy gap (pseudogap) extends above Tc. The origin of this gap is one of the central issues in high-temperature superconductivity. Kondo et al. report evidence from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) that the pseudogap and high-temperature superconductivity represent two competing orders, with the pseudogap competing with the superconductivity by depleting the spectral weight available for pairing. In a classical Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer superconductor, pairing and coherence are established simultaneously below the critical transition temperature (Tc). But in the copper oxide high- Tc superconductors, a pseudogap extends above Tc. Spectral gaps arising from pairing precursors are qualitatively similar to those caused by competing states, rendering a standard approach to their analysis inconclusive. This paper reports that the spectral weight of the superconducting coherent peak increases away from the node following the trend of the superconducting gap, but then starts to decrease in the antinodal region. In a classical Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer superconductor, pairing and coherence of electrons are established simultaneously below the critical transition temperature (Tc), giving rise to a gap in the electronic energy spectrum. In the high-Tc copper oxide superconductors, however, a pseudogap1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 extends above Tc. The relationship between the pseudogap and superconductivity is one of the central issues in this field9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Spectral gaps arising from pairing precursors are qualitatively similar to those caused by competing electronic states, rendering a standard approach to their analysis inconclusive10,11,12,13,14,15,16. The issue can be settled, however, by studying the correlation between the weights associated with the pseudogap and superconductivity spectral features. Here we report a study of two spectral weights using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The weight of the superconducting coherent peak increases away from the node following the trend of the superconducting gap, but starts to decrease in the antinodal region. This striking non-monotonicity reveals the presence of a competing state. We demonstrate a direct correlation, for different values of momenta and doping, between the loss in the low-energy spectral weight arising from the opening of the pseudogap and a decrease in the spectral weight associated with superconductivity. We therefore conclude that the pseudogap competes with the superconductivity by depleting the spectral weight available for pairing."
https://openalex.org/W2075498034,"Tonic motor control involves oscillatory synchronization of activity at low frequency (5-30 Hz) throughout the sensorimotor system, including cerebellar areas. We investigated the mechanisms underpinning cerebellar oscillations. We found that Golgi interneurons, which gate information transfer in the cerebellar cortex input layer, are extensively coupled through electrical synapses. When depolarized in vitro, these neurons displayed low-frequency oscillatory synchronization, imposing rhythmic inhibition onto granule cells. Combining experiments and modeling, we show that electrical transmission of the spike afterhyperpolarization is the essential component for oscillatory population synchronization. Rhythmic firing arises in spite of strong heterogeneities, is frequency tuned by the mean excitatory input to Golgi cells, and displays pronounced resonance when the modeled network is driven by oscillating inputs. In vivo, unitary Golgi cell activity was found to synchronize with low-frequency LFP oscillations occurring during quiet waking. These results suggest a major role for Golgi cells in coordinating cerebellar sensorimotor integration during oscillatory interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1983874489,"Turbulent rotating convection controls many observed features of stars and planets, such as magnetic fields, atmospheric jets and emitted heat flux patterns. It has long been argued that the influence of rotation on turbulent convection dynamics is governed by the ratio of the relevant global-scale forces: the Coriolis force and the buoyancy force. Here, however, we present results from laboratory and numerical experiments which exhibit transitions between rotationally dominated and non-rotating behaviour that are not determined by this global force balance. Instead, the transition is controlled by the relative thicknesses of the thermal (non-rotating) and Ekman (rotating) boundary layers. We formulate a predictive description of the transition between the two regimes on the basis of the competition between these two boundary layers. This transition scaling theory unifies the disparate results of an extensive array of previous experiments, and is broadly applicable to natural convection systems."
https://openalex.org/W1987586798,"Mutations can be beneficial under conditions in which genetic diversity is advantageous, such as somatic hypermutation and antibody generation, but they can also be lethal when they disrupt basic cellular processes or cause uncontrolled proliferation and cancer. Mutations arise from inaccurate processing of lesions generated by endogenous and exogenous DNA damaging agents, and the genome is particularly vulnerable to such damage during S phase. In this phase of the cell cycle, many lesions in the DNA template block replication. Such lesions must be bypassed in order to preserve fork stability and to ensure completion of DNA replication. Lesion bypass is carried out by a set of error-prone and error-free processes collectively referred to as DNA damage tolerance mechanisms. Here, we discuss how two types of DNA damage tolerance, translesion synthesis and template switching, are regulated at stalled replication forks by ubiquitination of PCNA, and the conditions under which they occur."
https://openalex.org/W2013215890,"The mechanism of widespread neuronal death occurring in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains enigmatic even after extensive investigation during the last two decades. Amyloid beta 42 peptide (Aβ1–42) is believed to play a causative role in the development of AD. Here we expressed human Aβ1–42 and amyloid beta 40 (Aβ1–40) in Drosophila neurons. Aβ1–42 but not Aβ1–40 causes an extensive accumulation of autophagic vesicles that become increasingly dysfunctional with age. Aβ1–42-induced impairment of the degradative function, as well as the structural integrity, of post-lysosomal autophagic vesicles triggers a neurodegenerative cascade that can be enhanced by autophagy activation or partially rescued by autophagy inhibition. Compromise and leakage from post-lysosomal vesicles result in cytosolic acidification, additional damage to membranes and organelles, and erosive destruction of cytoplasm leading to eventual neuron death. Neuronal autophagy initially appears to play a pro-survival role that changes in an age-dependent way to a pro-death role in the context of Aβ1–42 expression. Our in vivo observations provide a mechanistic understanding for the differential neurotoxicity of Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40, and reveal an Aβ1–42-induced death execution pathway mediated by an age-dependent autophagic-lysosomal injury."
https://openalex.org/W2110579982,"S100B is a Ca(2+)-binding protein of the EF-hand type that is abundantly expressed in astrocytes and has been implicated in the regulation of several intracellular activities, including proliferation and differentiation. We show here that reducing S100B levels in the astrocytoma cell line GL15 and the Müller cell line MIO-M1 by small interference RNA technique results in a rapid disassembly of stress fibers, collapse of F-actin onto the plasma membrane and reduced migration, and acquisition of a stellate shape. Also, S100B-silenced GL15 and MIO-M1 Müller cells show a higher abundance of glial fibrillary acidic protein filaments, which mark differentiated astrocytes, compared with control cells. These effects are dependent on reduced activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) downstream effectors, Akt and RhoA, and consequently elevated activity of GSK3beta and Rac1 and decreased activity of the RhoA-associated kinase. Also, rat primary astrocytes transiently down-regulate S100B expression when exposed to the differentiating agent dibutyryl cyclic AMP and re-express S100B at later stages of dibutyryl cyclic AMP-induced differentiation. Moreover, reducing S100B levels results in a remarkably slow resumption of S100B expression, suggesting the S100B might regulate its own expression. Finally, we show that S100B interacts with Src kinase, thereby stimulating the PI3K/Akt and PI3K/RhoA pathways. These results suggest that S100B might contribute to reduce the differentiation potential of cells of the astrocytic lineage and participate in the astrocyte activation process in the case of brain insult and in invasive properties of glioma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2073620012,"Radial glia are highly polarized cells that serve as neuronal progenitors and as scaffolds for neuronal migration during construction of the cerebral cortex. How radial glial cells establish and maintain their morphological polarity is unknown. Using conditional gene targeting in mice, we demonstrate that adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) serves an essential function in the maintenance of polarized radial glial scaffold during brain development. In the absence of APC, radial glial cells lose their polarity and responsiveness to the extracellular polarity maintenance cues, such as neuregulin-1. Elimination of APC further leads to marked instability of the radial glial microtubule cytoskeleton. The resultant changes in radial glial function and loss of APC in radial glial progeny lead to defective generation and migration of cortical neurons, severely disrupted cortical layer formation, and aberrant axonal tract development. Thus, APC is an essential regulator of radial glial polarity and is critical for the construction of cerebral cortex in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1977441106,"Theoretically the abnormally blue and massive stars known as blue stragglers should have evolved off the main stellar sequence and died long ago. But they are still to be found in globular clusters. Two scenarios to account for their presence have been suggested — direct stellar collisions or binary evolution. A new analysis of the data from known blue stragglers reveals a clear, but sublinear, correlation between the number of blue stragglers in a cluster core and the total stellar mass contained within it. This finding favours binary systems as the source for blue stragglers. Blue stragglers in globular clusters are abnormally massive stars that should have evolved off the stellar main sequence long ago. There are two processes that can create these objects: direct stellar collisions or binary evolution. This study reports that there is a clear, but sublinear, correlation between the number of blue stragglers found in a cluster core and the total stellar mass contained within it, and it is concluded that most blue stragglers come from binary systems. Blue stragglers in globular clusters are abnormally massive stars that should have evolved off the stellar main sequence long ago. There are two known processes that can create these objects: direct stellar collisions1 and binary evolution2. However, the relative importance of these processes has remained unclear. In particular, the total number of blue stragglers found in a given cluster does not seem to correlate with the predicted collision rate3,4, providing indirect support for the binary-evolution model. Yet the radial distributions of blue stragglers in many clusters are bimodal, with a dominant central peak5,6,7: this has been interpreted as an indication that collisions do dominate blue straggler production, at least in the high-density cluster cores7,8. Here we report that there is a clear, but sublinear, correlation between the number of blue stragglers found in a cluster core and the total stellar mass contained within it. From this we conclude that most blue stragglers, even those found in cluster cores, come from binary systems. The parent binaries, however, may themselves have been affected by dynamical encounters. This may be the key to reconciling all of the seemingly conflicting results found to date."
https://openalex.org/W2168557205,"Because a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (tumor-initiating cells, TICs) is believed to be responsible for the development, progression, and recurrence of many tumors, we evaluated the in vitro sensitivity of human glioma TICs to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors (erlotinib and gefitinib) and possible molecular determinants for their effects. Cells isolated from seven glioblastomas (GBM 1-7) and grown using neural stem cell permissive conditions were characterized for in vivo tumorigenicity, expression of tumor stem cell markers (CD133, nestin), and multilineage differentiation properties, confirming that these cultures are enriched in TICs. TIC cultures were challenged with increasing concentrations of erlotinib and gefitinib, and their survival was evaluated after 1-4 days. In most cases, a time- and concentration-dependent cell death was observed, although GBM 2 was completely insensitive to both drugs, and GBM 7 was responsive only to the highest concentrations tested. Using a radioligand binding assay, we show that all GBM TICs express EGFR. Erlotinib and gefitinib inhibited EGFR and ERK1/2 phosphorylation/activation in all GBMs, irrespective of the antiproliferative response observed. However, under basal conditions GBM 2 showed a high Akt phosphorylation that was completely insensitive to both drugs, whereas GBM 7 was completely insensitive to gefitinib, and Akt inactivation occurred only for the highest erlotinib concentration tested, showing a precise relationship with the antiproliferative effects of the drug. Interestingly, in GBM 2, phosphatase and tensin homolog expression was significantly down-regulated, possibly accounting for the insensitivity to the drugs. In conclusion, glioma TICs are responsive to anti-EGFR drugs, but phosphatase and tensin homolog expression and Akt inhibition seem to be necessary for such effect.

Cerebral tumors represent 2% of all cancers, with an incidence of 14 new cases every year for 100,000 individuals, with gliomas representing the most frequent histotype (86% of total brain neoplasias) (11Wen P.Y. Kesari S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 359: 492-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (3296) Google Scholar). These tumors, according to the World Health Organization classification, are divided into four groups, and glioblastoma (GBM) (grade IV) represents the most common and aggressive form, with a median survival time of 14 months (12Louis D.N.

GBM is a poorly differentiated astrocytic tumor with preferential localization in the cerebral hemispheres, but it is able to infiltrate the surrounding tissues in a way reminiscent of the ability of neural stem cells to migrate to distance. This ability is the main cause of the poor prognosis and failure of conventional treatments with radioor chemotherapy observed in this tumor (13Preusser M. Haberler C. Hainfellner J.A. Wien. Med.

Other growth factors, such as vascular-endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, play a role in the maintenance and development of the central nervous system. Different studies have evaluated the importance of these growth factors and their receptors in glioma growth and maintenance, demonstrating that these factors are also involved in proliferation, tumorigenicity, and malignancy of the tumors (21van der Valk P.

Thus, this study was aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of TIC-enriched cultures to gefitinib and erlotinib, two clinically approved EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKI). We isolated GBM TICs from seven fresh human GBMs. Cells were expanded in vitro in a proliferation-permissive medium, and the expression of different markers, multilineage differentiation capability, and tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice was evaluated. After this characterization, GBM TICs have been tested for their sensitivity to the antiproliferative activity of erlotinib and gefitinib and for the modulation of the intracellular signaling involved, namely the ERK1/2 and Akt pathways. Isolation of Human Glioma Tumor-initiating Cells-Glioma specimens were obtained after informed consent from seven patients, 6 males and 1 female, with an average age of 62 years (range 49-74). Tumor samples were obtained during surgery from patients of the Neurosurgery Department, San Martino Hospital (Genova, Italy). All patients underwent surgery for the first time and never received chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Tumor samples, classified as gliomas grade IV (GBM) based on World Health Organization criteria, were immediately processed for isolation of single cells by mechanical dissociation and plated at the concentration of 105 cells/ml in Matrigel-coated culture flasks (BD Biosciences) in a proliferation permissive medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 and Neurobasal (1:1), B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), recombinant human bFGF (10 ng/ml; PeproTech, London, UK), and recombinant human EGF (20 ng/ml; PeproTech). All acutely dissociated primary GBM cells gave rise to neurospheres within 1-2 weeks but also grew as a monolayer on Matrigel for more than 10 passages, without losing their spherogenic properties (28Gangemi R.M.

Lyophilized human recombinant EGF and bFGF were purchased by PeproTech EC (London, UK), reconstituted in double distilled H2O, and stored in working aliquots of 50 ng/100 μl at -20 °C. Human recombinant 3-[125I]iodotyrosyl-EGF, specific activity >750 Ci/mmol, (IM196) aqueous solution, was from GE Healthcare. Hanks’ balanced salt solution CaCl2/MgCl2-free was purchased from Invitrogen; bovine serum albumin, fraction V, was from Sigma. Antibody directed against phospho-Akt (Ser-473), Akt, phospho-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); anti-phospho-EGFR (Tyr-1173) and anti-EGFR antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Differentiation Assay-To induce differentiation into different brain cell histotypes, GBM cells were seeded on Matrigel-coated coverslips at the concentration of 1 × 104 cells per slide in a medium without growth factors and containing 10% fetal calf serum (EuroClone, Pavia, Italy) for 2 weeks (30Gangemi R.M. Daga A. Muzio L. Marubbi D. Cocozza S. Perera M. Verardo S. Bordo D. Griffero F. Capra M.C. Mallamaci A. Corte G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 23: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To keep a better reproducibility, all the following experiments were performed using cells grown in vitro for 15-25 passages. Immunofluorescence-For xenograft tumor analysis, mice were sacrificed, and cryopreserved brain sections were cut using a 10-μm cryostat (CM 1100; Leica, Germany). Staining with hematoxylin-eosin identified sections bearing tumors. Briefly, brain sections were mounted on slides and stained with Harris hematoxylin for 40 s and then counterstained with alcoholic eosin for 30 s. Cryosections containing tumors were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and blocked in 10% normal goat serum/PBS. After incubation with anti-human nestin antibody (mouse monoclonal, diluted 1:1,000; Abcam (Cambridge, UK)) in NGS-PBS overnight at 4 °C, sections were washed in Tris-buffered saline. Immunopositivity was revealed using Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:700; Invitrogen). Cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) to identify the nuclei. To examine the expression of different brain cell lineage markers in undifferentiated and differentiated human glioma TICs, cells were plated onto Matrigel-coated glass coverslips and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized and stained with different primary antibodies as follows: anti-human nestin, anti-Map2 (mouse monoclonal, 1:1,000; Chemicon/Millipore, Milano, Italy), and anti-GFAP (rabbit polyclonal, 1:10,000; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Following washing with PBS, cells were exposed to the appropriate secondary fluorescent antibody (Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, 1:700 or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch Europe, Cambridgeshire, UK) and counterstained with Hoechst 33342 dye to identify all nuclei. Data are reported as percentage of immunolabeled cells from five randomly selected microscopy fields. Images were obtained with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope (Nikon Europe, Lijnden, The Netherlands). Tumorigenicity-Human glioma TICs in vivo tumorigenicity was tested by cell intracranial inoculation in 6-8-week-old NOD/SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories, Calco, Italy). Preliminary experiments showed that as few as 5,000 cells (not selected for CD133 expression) were able to induce tumors with a latency of up to 180 days. To obtain a more rapid evaluation of the results, we decided to inject 105 cells from each TIC culture. Three mice for each GBM cell culture were used. Mice were anesthetized intramuscularly with 20 μl of ketamine (2%) and xylazine (100 mg/ml) and positioned into a stereotactic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). A hole was made in the skull using a 21-gauge needle, 2.5 mm lateral and 1 mm anterior from the intersection of the coronal and sagittal sutures (bregma), and cells were injected in the left corpus striatum using a Hamilton syringe (series 7000; Sigma) at a depth of 3.5 mm (total volume 2 μl). Mice were monitored for about 6 months for disease symptoms and were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation when they showed weight loss or any severe sign of disease. All experiments, including animals, were performed in compliance with guidelines approved by the Ethical Committee for animal use in cancer research at the National Institute for Cancer Research (Genova, Italy). CD133+ Cell Isolation and Quantification-Human GBM TICs were sorted by CD133 expression with Miltenyi microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Briefly, cells were dissociated and resuspended in PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm EDTA. CD133/1 microbeads were used for positive magnetic cell separation using two magnetic cell separation columns in series. Aliquots of CD133+ and CD133- cells were evaluated for purity by flow cytometry using CD133/2-PE (Miltenyi Biotech) or isotype control antibody (IgG2b-PE, Miltenyi Biotech) and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). For one-color cytofluorimetric analysis, human glioma TICs were stained with the appropriate monoclonal antibodies followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated isotype-specific goat anti-mouse second reagent (Southern Biotechnology Associated, Birmingham, AL). MTT Assay-For MTT assay, human GBM TICs were plated in 96-well microplates previously coated with Matrigel. Because the cells employed in this study had different proliferation rates, the number of cultured cells was adjusted to a density that allowed the cells to grow exponentially for all the duration of the assay (up to 4 days) ranging from 2,500 to 10,000 cells/well. We tested the effects of erlotinib and gefitinib using three concentrations as follows: 0.5, 1, and 5 μm. After exposure to the drugs for different times (0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h) at 37 °C, cells were incubated for 4 h in MTT solution (2 mg/ml in PBS). After removing MTT, 150 μl of DMSO were added to each well, and the absorbance was determined at 540 nm wavelength, as reported (31Arena S. Barbieri F. Thellung S. Pirani P. Corsaro A. Villa V. Dadati P. Dorcaratto A. Lapertosa G. Ravetti J.L. Spaziante R. Schettini G. Florio T. J. Neurooncol. 2004; 66: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. Radioreceptor Assay with 125I-Labeled EGF/Unlabeled EGF Competitive Binding to EGFR-Human GBM TICs were plated at the concentration of 1.5 × 105 in duplicate wells using the proliferation permissive medium in Matrigel pre-coated 24-well plates (28Gangemi R.M. Griffero F. Marubbi D. Perera M. Capra M.C. Malatesta P. Ravetti G.L. Zona G.L. Daga A. Corte G. Stem Cells. 2008; 23: 23Google Scholar) and incubated overnight at 37 °C, before the medium was changed with a growth factor-deprived medium for an additional 48 or 96 h according to the experimental protocol. At the end of this period, cell monolayers were washed once with 1 ml/well of Binding Buffer (BB: Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 40 mm Hepes, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for an additional 60 min. Cells were then treated with 125I-labeled EGF (average 2 × 104 cpm in 200 μl/well of BB) and serially increasing amounts of unlabeled peptide (0.195-50 ng/ml for standard curve + 400 ng/ml excess for nonspecific binding evaluation) in 200 μl/well BB (total volume/well = 400 μl). Plates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a shaker with gentle agitation. After binding, medium was carefully removed from each well and monolayers were washed three times with 500 μl/well ice-cold Washing Buffer (Hanks’ balanced salt solution, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Cells were lysed by adding 750 μl of Solubilizing Solution (20 mm Hepes, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 87% H2O) to each well and then incubated for 20-30 min at room temperature. An aliquot (80%) of solubilized and carefully homogenized material was than measured in a γ-counter (Cobra II Autogamma, Packard Instrument Co.) to quantify the released radioactivity of the bound ligand. Specific binding was calculated after subtraction of nonspecific binding and by means of Scatchard analysis, Bmax, and Kd values, and sites/cell were determined. Western Blotting-To avoid the activities of growth factors and other supplements present in the proliferation medium, cells were cultured for 48 h in a growth factor-free medium before being treated (32Florio T. Casagrande S. Diana F. Bajetto A. Porcile C. Zona G. Thellung S. Arena S. Pattarozzi A. Corsaro A. Spaziante R. Robello M. Schettini G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF (all from Sigma), and the “Complete” protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 10 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation (5,000 rpm at 4 °C, for 10 min), and total protein content was measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins (10 μg) were resuspended in 2× reducing sample buffer (2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 1.43 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% glycerol), electrophoresed on 7.5-10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) (32Florio T. Casagrande S. Diana F. Bajetto A. Porcile C. Zona G. Thellung S. Arena S. Pattarozzi A. Corsaro A. Spaziante R. Robello M. Schettini G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and probed with specific antibodies. The detection of immunocomplexes was performed using ECL system (GE Healthcare). RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR-Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and the “Total RNA Purification System” (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) and amplified with Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Milano, Italy) by PCR (iCYCLER Bio-Rad) using the following primers: 5′-aaagctggaaagggacgaac-3′ and 5′-caggtaacggctgagggaac-3′ (GenBank™ accession number NM_000314). Amplification profile was as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by 7 min at 72 °C. β-Actin amplification, used as positive control for the PCR, was performed using the following primers: sense 5′-tccggagacggggtca-3′ and antisense 5′-cctgcttgctgatcca-3′. The selected sequences encompass an intronic sequence in the β-actin gene that allow the identification of genomic DNA contamination (33Bajetto A. Barbieri F. Pattarozzi A. Dorcaratto A. Porcile C. Ravetti J.L. Zona G. Spaziante R. Schettini G. Florio T. Neuro. Oncol. 2007; 9: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Negative controls were obtained performing PCR amplification in the absence of RT reaction. Statistical Analysis-Data are reported as means ± S.E. of at least two independent experiments performed in triplicate. Statistical analysis (analysis of variance) was performed using the Software GraphPad QuickCalcs. A p value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Tumorigenicity of Human Glioma-derived Cells-We analyzed post-surgical explants from seven consecutive human gliomas, histopathologically classified as grade IV according to the World Health Organization grading. Tumor samples were immediately dissociated into single cells, and plated at clonal density in a proliferation medium, in Matrigel-coated flasks (see “Experimental Procedures”). Under these conditions these cells can be cultured in vitro retaining the ability to form neurospheres that, in limiting dilution experiments, are detected after 1 or 2 weeks, according to the tumor analyzed. To identify the presence of TICs in these cultures, we tested their in vivo tumorigenicity, to date the only test able to discriminate TICs from differentiated nontumorigenic cancer cells. A hundred thousand cells derived from all GBM cultures analyzed (called GBM 1-7) were orthotopically injected in immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 2-6 months, according to the GBM from which the cells were isolated (see Table 1), all cultures produced tumors with highly invasive properties that resembled the primitive neoplasia, thus confirming that our cultures are enriched in TICs. In particular, intracranial tumors generated by TICs injections demonstrated various grades of infiltration into the surrounding cerebral cortex, and GBM cells showed a propensity to migrate along the corpus callosum or other brain structures. GBM generated from the injected TICs were identified by histological analysis that confirmed the exclusive presence of human tumor cells, without significant contamination from murine cells, as assessed by the positive staining detected using anti-human nestin antibody (Fig. 1) and the lack of labeling using anti-mouse antibodies (data not shown). Importantly, in agreement with our previous studies (28Gangemi R.M. Griffero F. Marubbi D. Perera M. Capra M.C. Malatesta P. Ravetti G.L. Zona G.L. Daga A. Corte G. Stem Cells. 2008; 23: 23Google Scholar), no differences in tumorigenicity were observed culturing the cells as nonadherent neurosphere or in monolayer on Matrigel, in both cases injecting 105 cells the take rate was 100% even after more than 40 passages in vitro.TABLE 1Characterization of human glioma TICsTumor codeIn vivo tumorigenicity (survival, days)Percentage of positive cells in vitroPrimary tumorSecondary tumorNestin short termNestin long termCD133 short termCD133 long termGFAPMap2GBM1150-18090-11093 (±2)95 (±2.5)3 (±1.5)2 (±1)27 (±3)75.5 (±5.5)GBM280-9055-6578 (±2.5)75 (±5)1.8 (±0.8)1.6 (±1)4.5 (±0.5)8.5 (±3.5)GBM340-12040-6095 (±3.5)97 (±2.5)4.5 (±1.5)5.2 (±2)15 (±5)7.5 (±2.5)GBM4100-12080-9076 (±2.5)78 (±4)83 (±3)82 (±4)9.5 (±1)23 (±2.5)GBM570-8060-7040 (±6)35 (±5)85 (±4.5)80 (±3)3 (±1)40 (±5)GBM6120-17090-11069 (±3)65 (±5)2.5 (±1)5.1 (±0.5)7.5 (±2.5)75 (±5)GBM764-11055-7093 (±2)90 (±5)1.8 (±0.5)2.1 (±0.5)80 (±6)12.5 (±2.5) Open table in a new tab Cells, isolated from dissociated intracranial xenograft tumors and re-cultured under stem cells conditions, were able to form neurospheres. When cells were injected back into the brain of new recipient mice, they not only retained the ability to generate new tumors but also showed an increased tumorigenic potential, as shown by the shorter time required for tumor development (Table 1). Characterization and Differentiation of Human Glioma Tumor-initiating Cells-All the human glioma TICs that we isolated from GBM 1-7 displayed the potential for multilineage differentiation and clonogenicity in vitro, which are typical features of neural stem cells. In particular, immunofluorescence and cytofluorimetric analysis showed that the expression of nestin and CD133, respectively, was clearly detectable in subpopulations of these cultures (Table 1). In agreement with the stemness of these cultures, nestin was expressed in an extremely high percentage of cells (up to 97% in GBM 3, see Table 1). The identification of a CD133-positive subpopulation within these cultures was also particularly relevant, because this protein is recognized as a marker of glioma TICs (34Singh S.K. Clarke I.D. Terasaki M. Bonn V.E. Hawkins C. Squire J. Dirks P.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5821-5828PubMed Google Scholar, 35Singh S.K. Hawkins C. Clarke I.D. Squire J.A. Ba"
https://openalex.org/W2003632243,"In order to enrich the phylogenetic diversity represented in the available sequenced bacterial genomes and as part of an “Assembling the Tree of Life” project, we determined the genome sequence of Thermomicrobium roseum DSM 5159. T. roseum DSM 5159 is a red-pigmented, rod-shaped, Gram-negative extreme thermophile isolated from a hot spring that possesses both an atypical cell wall composition and an unusual cell membrane that is composed entirely of long-chain 1,2-diols. Its genome is composed of two circular DNA elements, one of 2,006,217 bp (referred to as the chromosome) and one of 919,596 bp (referred to as the megaplasmid). Strikingly, though few standard housekeeping genes are found on the megaplasmid, it does encode a complete system for chemotaxis including both chemosensory components and an entire flagellar apparatus. This is the first known example of a complete flagellar system being encoded on a plasmid and suggests a straightforward means for lateral transfer of flagellum-based motility. Phylogenomic analyses support the recent rRNA-based analyses that led to T. roseum being removed from the phylum Thermomicrobia and assigned to the phylum Chloroflexi. Because T. roseum is a deep-branching member of this phylum, analysis of its genome provides insights into the evolution of the Chloroflexi. In addition, even though this species is not photosynthetic, analysis of the genome provides some insight into the origins of photosynthesis in the Chloroflexi. Metabolic pathway reconstructions and experimental studies revealed new aspects of the biology of this species. For example, we present evidence that T. roseum oxidizes CO aerobically, making it the first thermophile known to do so. In addition, we propose that glycosylation of its carotenoids plays a crucial role in the adaptation of the cell membrane to this bacterium's thermophilic lifestyle. Analyses of published metagenomic sequences from two hot springs similar to the one from which this strain was isolated, show that close relatives of T. roseum DSM 5159 are present but have some key differences from the strain sequenced."
https://openalex.org/W2003169571,"Disposition of the second messenger nitric oxide (NO) in mammalian tissues occurs through multiple pathways including dioxygenation by erythrocyte hemoglobin and red muscle myoglobin. Metabolism by a putative NO dioxygenase activity in non-striated tissues has also been postulated, but the exact nature of this activity is unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that cytoglobin, a newly discovered hexacoordinated globin, participates in cell-mediated NO consumption. Stable expression of small hairpin RNA targeting cytoglobin in fibroblasts resulted in decreased NO consumption and intracellular nitrate production. These cells were more sensitive to NO-induced inhibition of cell respiration and proliferation, which could be restored by re-expression of human cytoglobin. We also demonstrated cytoglobin expression in adventitial fibroblasts as well as vascular smooth muscle cells from various species including human and found that cytoglobin was expressed in the adventitia and media of intact rat aorta. These results indicate that cytoglobin contributes to cell-mediated NO dioxygenation and represents an important NO sink in the vascular wall."
https://openalex.org/W2041254716,"Prolonged stimulation leads to specific and stable changes in an animal's behavior. In interneurons, this plasticity requires spatial and temporal control of neuronal protein synthesis. Whether such translational control occurs in sensory neurons is not known. Adaptation of the AWC olfactory sensory neurons of C. elegans requires the cGMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4. Here, we show that the RNA-binding PUF protein FBF-1 is required in the adult AWC for adaptation. In the odor-adapted animal, it increases translation via binding to the egl-4 3′ UTR. Further, the PUF protein may localize translation near the sensory cilia and cell body. Although the RNA-binding PUF proteins have been shown to promote plasticity in development by temporally and spatially repressing translation, this work reveals that in the adult nervous system, they can work in a different way to promote experience-dependent plasticity by activating translation in response to environmental stimulation.

Complex behaviors require accurate and efficient sensing of the environment as well as the ability to ignore persistent stimuli that offer little new information. Since sensory neurons provide the information from which most behaviors arise, the ability of these neurons to modulate their excitability, as a function of experience is critical. While brief stimulation elicits rapidly reversible adjustments in excitability that allow the animal to track changes in its environment, prolonged stimulation elicits more enduring homeostatic changes that allow the animal to reset its sensitivity to long-lasting alterations such as day-to-night changes in light intensity (Calvert et al., 2006Calvert P.D. Strissel K.J. Schiesser W.E. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y.

Repeated experiences also elicit changes in behavior that require alterations in the sensitivity of interneurons within neural circuits. Repeated stimulation or prolonged alteration in the pattern of stimulation of specific connections can lead to long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), or homeostatic synaptic scaling within the synaptic connections between hippocampal cells. These changes have been shown to underlie the animal's ability to form memories as a function of repeated experience (see Sutton and Schuman, 2005Sutton M.A. Schuman E.M.

Dendritic protein synthesis, synaptic plasticity, and memory.Cell. 2006; 127: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, for review). The nematode C. elegans also adjusts its behavior as a function of experience. Though some odors are inherently attractive to naive C. elegans, they will begin to ignore such odors after being exposed to them for a prolonged period of time (Bargmann et al., 1993Bargmann C.I. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Odorant-selective genes and neurons mediate olfaction in C. elegans.Cell. 1993; 74: 515-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). C. elegans is inherently attracted to over 60 different volatile chemical compounds, many of which stimulate the paired AWA and AWC olfactory sensory neurons (Bargmann et al., 1993Bargmann C.I. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Odorant-selective genes and neurons mediate olfaction in C. elegans.Cell. 1993; 74: 515-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Remarkably, though each AWC can probably sense tens of odors (Troemel, 1999Troemel E.R. Chemosensory signaling in C. elegans.Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1011-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), sensitivity to individual odors can be decreased independently (Colbert and Bargmann, 1995Colbert H.A. Bargmann C.I. Odorant-specific adaptation pathways generate olfactory plasticity in C. elegans.Neuron. 1995; 14: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Sensitivity to an odor decreases as the length of prior exposure to that odor increases (Colbert and Bargmann, 1995Colbert H.A. Bargmann C.I.

That is, while initial exposure to an odor gradient elicits chemotaxis to the point source, a 30 min pre-exposure to the same odor will reversibly decrease chemotaxis (short-term adaptation) and exposures of more than 1 hr will stably decrease odor-seeking for hours (long-term adaptation) (Colbert and Bargmann, 1995Colbert H.A.

Odor sensation is thought to occur within the sensory cilia of the AWC neuron where the odor responsive G protein-coupled receptors reside (Sengupta et al., 1996Sengupta P. Chou J.H.

Lowered cGMP levels favor closing of the cyclic nucleotide-gated sensory channel TAX-2/4 (Chalasani et al., 2007Chalasani S.H. Chronis N. Tsunozaki M. Gray J.M. Ramot D. Goodman M.B. Bargmann C.I.

How do these sensory neurons alter their responsiveness as a function of prolonged or repeated experience? Retinal cells within the visual system shuttle previously synthesized adaptation-promoting proteins into the sensory compartment to dampen the incoming signal. Prolonged exposure of rods to bright light induces massive translocation of arrestin from the inner segment to the outer segment where arrestin binds to the GPCR rhodopsin and limits the light-induced signaling (Calvert et al., 2006Calvert P.D. Strissel K.J. Schiesser W.E. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y.

Mammalian olfactory neurons adjust their sensitivity by relocating previously synthesized proteins away from possible stimulation: prolonged odor exposure induces clathrin-mediated endocytosis to remove the olfactory receptor GPCRs from the cell surface (Mashukova et al., 2006Mashukova A. Spehr M. Hatt H. Neuhaus E.M. Beta-arrestin2-mediated internalization of mammalian odorant receptors.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9902-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interneurons, however, use a different strategy to adjust to repeated stimulation: they synthesize new proteins such as CamKII (Miller et al., 2002Miller S. Yasuda M. Coats J.K. Jones Y. Martone M.E.

Synapse formation and mRNA localization in cultured Aplysia neurons.Neuron. 2006; 49: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) within the vicinity of the stimulated synapse. The net effect of these proteins is to alter channel composition (Chowdhury et al., 2006Chowdhury S. Shepherd J.D. Okuno H. Lyford G. Petralia R.S. Plath N. Kuhl D. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F.

Though translational control mechanisms are central to the function of interneurons it is not known whether sensory neurons employ a similar strategy. In the C. elegans AWC sensory neurons, both short-term and long-term adaptation require the cGMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 (L'Etoile et al., 2002L'Etoile N.D. Coburn C.M. Eastham J. Kistler A. Gallegos G. Bargmann C.I. The cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 regulates olfactory adaptation in C. elegans.Neuron. 2002; 36: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, mutations within the egl-4 3′UTR interfere with adaptation (L'Etoile et al., 2002L'Etoile N.D. Coburn C.M. Eastham J. Kistler A. Gallegos G. Bargmann C.I. The cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 regulates olfactory adaptation in C. elegans.Neuron. 2002; 36: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We found that these residues are part of a highly conserved translation-repressing Nanos Response Element (NRE) (Murata and Wharton, 1995Murata Y. Wharton R.P. Binding of pumilio to maternal hunchback mRNA is required for posterior patterning in Drosophila embryos.Cell. 1995; 80: 747-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, Zamore et al., 1997Zamore P.D. Williamson J.R. Lehmann R. The Pumilio protein binds RNA through a conserved domain that defines a new class of RNA-binding proteins.RNA. 1997; 3: 1421-1433PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as in interneurons, translational control within in sensory neurons may be crucial for appropriate behavior in the adult animal. NREs bind the Pumilio/Fem-3 binding factor (PUF) family of translational repressors. The founding member, Pumilio, first discovered in Drosophila, was shown to establish the anterior-posterior embryonic axis during development (Lehmann and Nusslein-Volhard, 1991Lehmann R. Nusslein-Volhard C. The maternal gene nanos has a central role in posterior pattern formation of the Drosophila embryo.Development. 1991; 112: 679-691PubMed Google Scholar) by binding to and repressing translation of maternal hunchback mRNA (Murata and Wharton, 1995Murata Y. Wharton R.P. Binding of pumilio to maternal hunchback mRNA is required for posterior patterning in Drosophila embryos.Cell. 1995; 80: 747-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). PUFs have been characterized as translational repressors that seem to work either by reducing translation of the target message or increasing its decay (Wickens et al., 2002Wickens M. Bernstein D.S. Kimble J. Parker R. A PUF family portrait: 3′UTR regulation as a way of life.Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 150-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence suggests that yeast, human, and C. elegans PUFs may accomplish this by interacting with deadenylating and decapping protein complexes; (Goldstrohm et al., 2006Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. PUF proteins bind Pop2p to regulate messenger RNAs.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, Goldstrohm et al., 2007Goldstrohm A.C. Seay D.J. Hook B.A. Wickens M. PUF protein-mediated deadenylation is catalyzed by Ccr4p.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, in Xenopus oocyte maturation, PUF-binding elements in combination with cytoplasmic polyadenylation sites have been shown to increase translation of their targets (Piqué et al., 2008Piqué M. López J.M. Foissac S. Guigó R. Méndez R. A combinatorial code for CPE-mediated translational control.Cell. 2008; 132: 434-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) while in the developing hypodermis and nerve cord of C. elegans they repress translation in combination with microRNA-binding sites (Nolde et al., 2007Nolde M.J. Saka N. Reinert K.L. Slack F.J. The Caenorhabditis elegans pumilio homolog, puf-9, is required for the 3′UTR-mediated repression of the let-7 microRNA target gene, hbl-1.Dev. Biol. 2007; 305: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is not known how Pumilios either by themselves or in combination with other factors act in the context of an adult neuron. In other systems, PUFs have been shown to focus translation spatially and temporally: in yeast, Puf6p restricts Ash1p expression to the bud cell by localizing ASH1 mRNA to the bud tip (Gu et al., 2004Gu W. Deng Y. Zenklusen D. Singer R.H. A new yeast PUF family protein, Puf6p, represses ASH1 mRNA translation and is required for its localization.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1452-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and in C. elegans, FBF-1/2 restrict the expression of the sperm-promoting factor FEM-3 to the larval period when spermatocytes are produced (Zhang et al., 1997Zhang B. Gallegos M. Puoti A. Durkin E. Fields S. Kimble J. Wickens M.P. A conserved RNA-binding protein that regulates sexual fates in the C. elegans hermaphrodite germ line.Nature. 1997; 390: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The ability of PUFs to focus translation in a spatiotemporal fashion makes them attractive candidates for promoting plasticity within neurons. Indeed, in neurons within the developing Drosophila larva, Pumilio's ability to repress translation is required for regulation of neuronal membrane excitability (Mee et al., 2004Mee C.J. Pym E.C. Moffat K.G. Baines R.A. Regulation of neuronal excitability through pumilio-dependent control of a sodium channel gene.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8695-8703Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and appropriate synaptic development and plasticity (Menon et al., 2004Menon K.P. Sanyal S. Habara Y. Sanchez R. Wharton R.P.

The translational repressor Pumilio regulates presynaptic morphology and controls postsynaptic accumulation of translation factor eIF-4E.Neuron. 2004; 44: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) as well as proper dendritic branching (Ye et al., 2004Ye B. Petritsch C. Clark I.E. Gavis E.R. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nanos and Pumilio are essential for dendrite morphogenesis in Drosophila peripheral neurons.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 314-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the adult fly, dPUM is required for olfactory associative learning (Dubnau et al., 2003Dubnau J. Chiang A.S. Grady L. Barditch J. Gossweiler S. McNeil J. Smith P. Buldoc F. Scott R. Certa U. et al.The staufen/pumilio pathway is involved in Drosophila long-term memory.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 286-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) and to limit motor neuron excitability (Schweers et al., 2002Schweers B.A. Walters K.J. Stern M. The Drosophila melanogaster translational repressor pumilio regulates neuronal excitability.Genetics. 2002; 161: 1177-1185PubMed Google Scholar). In adult mice, Pumilio1 mRNA (Rouhana et al., 2005Rouhana L. Wang L. Buter N. Kwak J.E. Schiltz C.A. Gonzalez T. Kelley A.E. Landry C.F. Wickens M. Vertebrate GLD2 poly(A) polymerases in the germline and the brain.RNA. 2005; 11: 1117-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and PUM2 protein (Xu et al., 2007Xu E.Y. Chang R. Salmon N.A. Reijo Pera R.A. A gene trap mutation of a murine homolog of the Drosophila stem cell factor Pumilio results in smaller testes but does not affect litter size or fertility.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2007; 74: 912-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) are observed in the hippocampus. However, the mechanisms by which PUFs function and the targets they regulate in the adult nervous system are not known. Here, we show that both the PUF-binding site within the egl-4 3′UTR and the PUF FBF-1 are required at the time of odor exposure to promote adaptation to the odors butanone and isoamyl alcohol. The ability of the egl-4 3′ UTR to bind FBF-1 is required both for adaptation and increased expression of the egl-4 3′UTR-dependent Kaede and luciferase reporters. The expression pattern of the Kaede reporter in the intact animal reveals that FBF-1 acts via the PUF-binding site to perhaps increase translation near the AWC sensory cilia and cell body. The luciferase reporter shows that odor exposure induces a dynamic increase in translation that is dependent upon the NR/FBE. Thus, we describe here a novel function for a PUF-binding element. Instead of repressing translation, as was seen in developing tissues, we find that in the adult functioning sensory neurons FBF-1 activates translation of its target in response to stimulation. The mechanism of activation requires a specific sequence within and surrounding the binding site to direct FBF-1 to increase translation and it does this without affecting message levels. Olfactory adaptation is defined as an animal's reduced attraction to an odor resulting from prolonged exposure to that odor (Figure 1A; Colbert and Bargmann, 1995Colbert H.A. Bargmann C.I. Odorant-specific adaptation pathways generate olfactory plasticity in C. elegans.Neuron. 1995; 14: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). An unbiased genetic screen to isolate key players in the adaptation process identified the mutant, egl-4(ky95) (L'Etoile et al., 2002L'Etoile N.D. Coburn C.M. Eastham J. Kistler A. Gallegos G. Bargmann C.I. The cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 regulates olfactory adaptation in C. elegans.Neuron. 2002; 36: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The egl-4(ky95) mutant strain was defective for adaptation to all AWC-sensed odors we tested (Figure 1B; L'Etoile et al., 2002L'Etoile N.D. Coburn C.M. Eastham J. Kistler A. Gallegos G. Bargmann C.I. The cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 regulates olfactory adaptation in C. elegans.Neuron. 2002; 36: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the coding region of this allele of egl-4 was intact, instead we found two point mutations in its 3′UTR (L'Etoile et al., 2002L'Etoile N.D. Coburn C.M. Eastham J. Kistler A. Gallegos G. Bargmann C.I. The cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 regulates olfactory adaptation in C. elegans.Neuron. 2002; 36: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) that disrupted a putative NRE (Figure 1C). This indicated that regulation of EGL-4 translation might be important for its function. Points of regulation could include: basal levels of EGL-4, its spatial distribution, or its dynamic expression in response to prolonged odor-stimulation. To understand how EGL-4 expression might be regulated, we examined the egl-4 NRE. NREs are defined by their ability to bind the RNA binding Pumilio class of translational repressors (Zamore et al., 1997Zamore P.D. Williamson J.R. Lehmann R. The Pumilio protein binds RNA through a conserved domain that defines a new class of RNA-binding proteins.RNA. 1997; 3: 1421-1433PubMed Google Scholar). The Drosophila genome encodes a single PUF dPum while the C. elegans genome encodes 11 predicted PUFs (Wickens et al., 2002Wickens M. Bernstein D.S. Kimble J. Parker R. A PUF family portrait: 3′UTR regulation as a way of life.Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 150-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) along with the newly predicted puf-12 (http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene?name=WBGene00014165;class=Gene). The C. elegans PUF family tree has two branches; PUF-8 and PUF-9 are closest to dPUM and the mammalian PUFs, while the other members are on a separate branch (Wickens et al., 2002Wickens M. Bernstein D.S. Kimble J. Parker R. A PUF family portrait: 3′UTR regulation as a way of life.Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 150-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Members of each branch bind to distinct RNA sequence elements: dPUM and PUF-8/9 bind an NRE while FBF-1 and FBF-2, two members of the other branch, bind a fem-3 binding element (FBE) (Opperman et al., 2005Opperman L. Hook B. DeFino M. Bernstein D.S. Wickens M. A single spacer nucleotide determines the specificities of two mRNA regulatory proteins.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Bernstein et al., 2005Bernstein D. Hook B. Hajarnavis A. Opperman L. Wickens M. Binding specificity and mRNA targets of a C. elegans PUF protein, FBF-1.RNA. 2005; 11: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar showed that dPUM cannot bind an FBE site conversely; FBF-1 does not interact with the hunchback NRE. NREs share sequence similarity with FBEs: both consist of a highly conserved UGUR (R represents A/G) sequence followed by either one (for the NRE) or two (for the FBE) less conserved nucleotides and then AU (Opperman et al., 2005Opperman L. Hook B. DeFino M. Bernstein D.S. Wickens M. A single spacer nucleotide determines the specificities of two mRNA regulatory proteins.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The element within the egl-4 3′UTR can be aligned with the hunchback NRE (Zamore et al., 1997Zamore P.D. Williamson J.R. Lehmann R. The Pumilio protein binds RNA through a conserved domain that defines a new class of RNA-binding proteins.RNA. 1997; 3: 1421-1433PubMed Google Scholar) in two registers as well as the FBF-binding gld-1 FBE (Crittenden et al., 2002Crittenden S.L. Bernstein D.S. Bachorik J.L. Thompson B.E. Gallegos M. Petcherski A.G. Moulder G. Barstead R. Wickens M. Kimble J. A conserved RNA-binding protein controls germline stem cells in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2002; 417: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C; Opperman et al., 2005Opperman L.

Biol. 2005; 12: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine whether this element was an NRE or FBE, we assessed its ability to bind either GST-tagged protein in a gel mobility shift assay. Both recombinant Drosophila Pumilio (GST-PUM-HD) (Zamore et al., 1997Zamore P.D. Williamson J.R. Lehmann R. The Pumilio protein binds RNA through a conserved domain that defines a new class of RNA-binding proteins.RNA. 1997; 3: 1421-1433PubMed Google Scholar) and C. elegans FBF-1 bound and shifted the electrophoretic mobility of a synthetic 30 nucleotide RNA oligomer containing the wild-type egl-4 element (Figure 1D, left gels). The affinity of Drosophila Pumilio for the egl-4 element (Kd = 43 nM) was comparable to its reported affinity for the canonical NRE (Kd = 25nM) (Zamore et al., 1997Zamore P.D. Williamson J.R. Lehmann R. The Pumilio protein binds RNA through a conserved domain that defines a new class of RNA-binding proteins.RNA. 1997; 3: 1421-1433PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the affinity of FBF-1 for the egl-4 NRE element (Kd = 75 nM) was also close to its reported affinity for the gld-1 FBF (Kd = 23 nM) (Bernstein et al., 2005Bernstein D. Hook B. Hajarnavis A. Opperman L. Wickens M. Binding specificity and mRNA targets of a C. elegans PUF protein, FBF-1.RNA. 2005; 11: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Neither protein bound appreciably to the corresponding sequence from the mutant ky95 allele (Figure 1D, right gels). As the egl-4 element bound either the Drosophila Pumilio or the C. elegans FBF-1 it is a verified but novel NRE, which we will refer to as an NR/FBE. To determine whether FBF-1 is expressed in the same neuron that EGL-4 acts to promote adaptation (L'Etoile et al., 2002L'Etoile N.D. Coburn C.M. Eastham J. Kistler A. Gallegos G. Bargmann C.I. The cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 regulates olfactory adaptation in C. elegans.Neuron. 2002; 36: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we placed the GFP reporter under the control of sequences 2 Kb upstream of the start site for FBF-1 transcription. GFP was expressed in both AWC neurons (Figure 2A), suggesting that FBF-1 is normally expressed in the same neurons as its proposed target, EGL-4. We then used our adaptation paradigm (Figure 1A) (Colbert and Bargmann, 1995Colbert H.A. Bargmann C.I. Odorant-specific adaptation pathways generate olfactory plasticity in C. elegans.Neuron. 1995; 14: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) to determine whether FBF-1 is required for adaptation to AWC-sensed odors. The fbf-1(ok91) null strain was proficient at sensing the odors benzaldehyde, butanone, and isoamyl alcohol (Figures 2B and S1), but failed to adapt to butanone and was compromised for adaptation to isoamyl alcohol (Figure 2B). This defect was somewhat odor specific since it was capable of benzaldehyde adaptation (Figure 2B). Given that EGL-4 acts cell-autonomously within the AWCs to promote adaptation (L'Etoile et al., 2002L'Etoile N.D. Coburn C.M. Eastham J. Kistler A. Gallegos G. Bargmann C.I. The cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 regulates olfactory adaptation in C. elegans.Neuron. 2002; 36: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we asked if FBF-1 does the same. When fbf-1 mutants expressed FBF-1 solely in the pair of AWCs and one other neuron pair (AWBs), they were able to adapt to butanone as well as wild-type (Figure 2C). Thus, FBF-1 is likely to act in the same neurons as its proposed translational target, EGL-4 (L'Etoile et al., 2002L'Etoile N.D. Coburn C.M. Eastham J. Kistler A. Gallegos G. Bargmann C.I.

https://openalex.org/W2135455927,"Neural circuit development requires concurrent morphological and functional changes. Here, we identify coordinated and inversely correlated changes in dendritic morphology and mEPSC amplitude following increased neural activity. We show that overexpression of β-catenin, a molecule that increases total dendritic length, mimics the effects of increased neuronal activity by scaling down mEPSC amplitudes, while postsynaptic expression of a protein that sequesters β-catenin reverses the effects of activity on reducing mEPSC amplitudes. These results were confirmed immunocytochemically as changes in the size and density of surface synaptic AMPA receptor clusters. In individual neurons there was an inverse linear relationship between total dendritic length and average mEPSC amplitude. Importantly, β-catenin overexpression in vivo promoted dendritic growth and reduced mEPSC amplitudes. Together, these results demonstrate that coordinated changes in dendritic morphology and unitary excitatory synaptic strength may serve as an important intrinsic mechanism that helps prevent neurons from overexcitation during neural circuit development.

Together, these results demonstrate that coordinated changes in dendritic morphology and unitary excitatory synaptic strength may serve as an important intrinsic mechanism that helps prevent neurons from overexcitation during neural circuit development. A critical mechanism by which activity influences the early postnatal development of neural circuits is via effects on dendritic arborization (Parrish et al., 2007Parrish J.Z. Emoto K.

Neurosci. 2002; 3: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Specifically, it has been demonstrated in a variety of in vitro and in vivo preparations that increased neural activity accelerates the growth of dendrites and the complexity of their arbors. For example, light stimulation of Xenopus tectal neurons in vivo accelerates the rate of dendritic arbor growth (Sin et al., 2002Sin W.C. Haas K. Ruthazer E.S. Cline H.T. Dendrite growth increased by visual activity requires NMDA receptor and Rho GTPases.Nature. 2002; 419: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Similarly, in cultured mammalian neurons, pharmacological manipulations that mimic elevated neural network activity increase total dendritic branch length and tip number (Redmond et al., 2002Redmond L.

Malenka R.C. Beta-catenin is critical for dendritic morphogenesis.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1169-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Both in vivo and in vitro, the effects of neural activity on dendritic growth appear to be mediated, at least in part, through activation of NMDA receptors and small Rho GTPases (Van Aelst and Cline, 2004Van Aelst L. Cline H.T. Rho GTPases and activity-dependent dendrite development.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Work in vitro also suggests that signaling through L type calcium channels, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases and the transcription factor CREB play an important role in activity-dependent increases in dendritic arborization (Redmond et al., 2002Redmond L.

These observations raise the question of whether the activity-dependent changes in dendritic arborization and synaptic strength are correlated. And if so, are these events regulated independently or coordinated? A molecular tool set that can be used to address this question is the cadherin/catenin cell adhesion complex, which has been shown to play an important role in regulating dendritic arborization during early postnatal development (Yu and Malenka, 2003Yu X. Malenka R.C. Beta-catenin is critical for dendritic morphogenesis.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1169-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Overexpression of N-cadherin, αN-catenin, or β-catenin increases dendritic arborization while expression of the intracellular domain of N-cadherin [N(intra)], which binds to β-catenin and sequesters it from functional cadherin/catenin complexes, reduces total dendritic branch length (TDBL). Importantly, N(intra) also blocks the increase in dendritic arborization elicited by mimicking increased neural activity (Yu and Malenka, 2003Yu X. Malenka R.C. Beta-catenin is critical for dendritic morphogenesis.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1169-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Thus, molecular manipulations of the cadherin/catenin complex can both mimic and block the effects of neural activity on TDBL. Furthermore, although cadherins and catenins have been proposed to play roles in synapse development (Dalva et al., 2007Dalva M.B. McClelland A.C. Kayser M.S. Cell adhesion molecules: signalling functions at the synapse.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 206-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, Salinas and Price, 2005Salinas P.C. Price S.R.

USA. 2007; 104: 13479-13484Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), an effect opposite to the scaling down of excitatory synaptic transmission in response to increased neural activity. Here, we address whether increased dendritic growth results in coordinated changes in the scaling of excitatory synaptic strength, and furthermore, if a causal relationship exists between these factors. We find that overexpression of β-catenin decreases miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude and surface AMPA receptor cluster size and density similar to the effects of increased neural activity. Furthermore, the effects of increased neural activity on the scaling down of synaptic strength are blocked by expression of N(intra). Importantly, we identify a strong inverse correlation between TDBL and mEPSC amplitude and show that neurons with increased TDBL have higher NMDAR/AMPAR ratios and can still respond to subsequent activity blockade by scaling up their mEPSC amplitudes. These results suggest that during later stages of postnatal development, activity-dependent increases in dendritic arborization, mediated by the cadherin/catenin complex, are sufficient to activate mechanisms that limit total synaptic input while leaving intact the ability to respond to further changes in neural activity. This phenomenon complements and adds to the armamentarium of mechanisms, such as Hebbian and homeostatic synaptic plasticity, which are believed to sculpt neural circuits during development. To investigate whether a correlation exists between changes in TDBL and synaptic strength, we selected a time point (12 days in vitro) at which both mEPSCs and dendritic length are measurable and subject to change. Neurons were filled with the fluorescent dye Alexa 568 hydrazide during whole-cell patch-clamp recording and fixed immediately upon electrode removal, ensuring that the exact same neurons were used for both electrophysiological and morphological assays. Post-fixation, dendritic morphology of these neurons was imaged using confocal microscopy and 3D reconstructed using Neurolucida software. Consistent with previous findings, overexpression of a stabilized form of β-catenin (β-catenin∗; see Experimental Procedures) increased TDBL (β-cat∗, 3492.6 ± 251.5 μm, n = 17, p < 0.005 compared to GFP alone, 2515.0 ± 140.4 μm, n = 26) (Figures 1A and 1D). This effect on TDBL was similar to the effects of mimicking increased neural activity with elevated extracellular potassium (K+, 3122.9 ± 159.5 μm, n = 22, p < 0.01) (Figure 1A). In contrast, expression of N(intra), a truncated form of N-cadherin that sequesters endogenous β-catenin and prevents it from participating in functional cadherin/catenin complexes, reduced TDBL [N(intra), 1875.1 ± 116.2 μm, n = 13, p = 0.005] and completely blocked the effects of depolarization on dendritic arborization [K+ + N(intra), 1754.2 ± 96.5 μm, n = 23, p < 0.001 compared to GFP alone, p < 0.001 compared to K+ alone] (Figure 1A). Concurrent with changes in TDBL, changes in total dendritic branch tip number (TDBTN) (Figure 1B) and total dendritic surface area (Figure 1C) were detected in all experimental conditions. Furthermore, changes in TDBL and TDBTN, as well as TDBL and total dendritic surface area were tightly correlated both for neurons transfected with GFP alone (Figure 1E, n = 26, r2 = 0.52, p < 0.001; Figure 1F, r2 = 0.72, p < 0.001) and for all experimentally manipulated neurons (Figure 1G, n = 101, r2 = 0.63, p < 0.0001; Figure 1H, r2 = 0.88, p < 0.001). Having confirmed that molecular manipulations of the cadherin/catenin complex can either mimic (β-catenin∗) or block [N(intra)] the effects of increased neural activity on dendritic arborization, we measured the basal synaptic properties of these neurons, recording mEPSCs using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. The effects of molecularly manipulating the cadherin/catenin complex on the amplitude of mEPSCs were essentially inversely correlated with their effects on dendritic morphology. Specifically, overexpression of β-catenin decreased mEPSC amplitude (β-cat∗, 12.60 ± 0.99 pA, n = 18, p < 0.05 compared to GFP alone, 16.09 ± 1.09 pA, n = 27) (Figures 2A and 2B), without significantly affecting mEPSC frequency (Figure S1). This effect was similar to that of mimicking increased neural activity by chronic depolarization with high K+ (K+, 11.41 ± 0.82 pA, n = 22, p < 0.005) (Leslie et al., 2001Leslie K.R. Nelson S.B. Turrigiano G.G. Postsynaptic depolarization scales quantal amplitude in cortical pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC170PubMed Google Scholar). An important procedural difference between our experiments using high K+ treatment and previous reports on the effects of chronic depolarization on mEPSCs (Leslie et al., 2001Leslie K.R. Nelson S.B. Turrigiano G.G. Postsynaptic depolarization scales quantal amplitude in cortical pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC170PubMed Google Scholar) is that the extracellular K+ concentration was elevated only from 7 to 9 days in vitro and recordings were made 3 days later. Thus, the effects of mimicking increased neural activity on promoting dendritic growth and reducing mEPSC amplitudes were long lasting. Importantly, the effect of chronic depolarization with high K+ on mEPSC amplitude was completely reversed by expression of N(intra) in the recorded postsynaptic neuron, under conditions of low transfection efficiency [K+ + N(intra), 17.51 ± 1.46pA, n = 25, p = 0.43 versus GFP, p = 0.001 versus K+] (Figure 2B). Expression of N(intra) alone did not affect mEPSC amplitude (17.11 ± 1.33 pA, n = 15, p = 0.56), indicating that the ability of N(intra) to prevent the decrease in mEPSC amplitude normally caused by high K+ treatment was not because its expression alone increased mEPSC amplitude. These results suggest that in response to the growth of dendritic arbors, mechanisms are activated that limit the strength of individual synapses. To address whether the changes in mean mEPSC amplitude as dendritic arbor length increases represent a form of synaptic scaling (Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Activity-dependent scaling of quantal amplitude in neocortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar, Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Homeostatic plasticity in the developing nervous system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar), we constructed cumulative probability graphs of mEPSC amplitudes. As predicted by the changes in mEPSC amplitudes, the graphs from neurons overexpressing β-catenin (Figure 2C, p < 0.005) or depolarized with high K+ (Figure 2D, p < 0.0001) are shifted to the left compared to data from cells expressing GFP alone. Transforming each point in the experimental graphs multiplicatively by a best fit equation (Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Activity-dependent scaling of quantal amplitude in neocortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar) (see Experimental Procedures and legends to Figures 2C and 2D for details) shifts the graphs back to the right such that they are essentially superimposable on the control graphs. In contrast, the cumulative probability graphs from neurons expressing N(intra) (Figure 2E, p = 1.00) or neurons expressing N(intra) and treated with high K+ [K+ + N(intra), Figure 2F, p = 0.85 versus GFP] were not significantly different than the control graphs. Thus, these experimental manipulations of TDBL did in fact elicit a form of synaptic scaling. None of these manipulations significantly affected the cellular input resistance, the soma surface area or the diameter of primary dendrites (Figure S2), variables that might influence our measurements. The effects of the cadherin/catenin complex are specific to mEPSCs as expression of β-catenin∗ or N(intra) does not affect mlPSC amplitude or frequency (Figure S3). A potential caveat to the interpretation of our results is that the whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from the soma, and thus dendritic filtering of the recorded mEPSCs may have occurred. Assuming the dendrites have passive cable properties, mEPSCs generated from distal synapses would be more extensively filtered than those generated from proximal synapses. Since we observed a decrease in mEPSC amplitude in neurons with larger dendritic arbors, we wanted to minimize the possibility that this result was due to a higher proportion of synapses on the larger neurons being located more distal from the soma compared to control cells with smaller dendritic arbors. To examine this possibility, we grouped the mEPSCs analyzed in Figures 2C–2F by rise time. This analysis revealed that the population of mEPSCs with the fastest rise times (rise time < 1 ms) exhibited the same changes in mEPSC amplitude as observed for the total population of mEPSCs (Figure 2G). Specifically, neurons transfected with β-catenin∗ (Figure 2G, 13.22 ± 1.24 pA, p < 0.05 versus GFP) or treated with high K+ (11.88 ± 1.05 pA, p < 0.005 versus GFP) have smaller mEPSC amplitudes compared to GFP controls (18.09 ± 1.54 pA) and the effects of K+ are completely rescued by expression of N(intra) in the postsynaptic neurons [K+ + N(intra), 19.62 ± 1.78 pA, p = 0.52 versus GFP, p < 0.001 versus K+]. Since mEPSCs with fast rise times most likely arise from synapses close to the soma (Stuart et al., 1999Stuart G. Sprouston N. Hausser M. Dendrites. Oxford. Univ. Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar, Williams and Mitchell, 2008Williams S.R. Mitchell S.J. Direct measurement of somatic voltage clamp errors in central neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and thus are much less susceptible to space clamping artifacts, these results demonstrate that the effects of β-catenin∗ expression and K+ treatment on mEPSC amplitudes likely reflect real changes in quantal amplitudes and are unlikely to be due to spatial redistribution of synapses on cells with larger dendritic arbors. Having shown that β-catenin overexpression and mimicking increased neural activity both promote dendritic arborization and reduce mEPSC amplitudes, we predicted that an inverse correlation exists between these parameters. Indeed, we observe a statistically significant inverse linear correlation between the parameters of TDBL and mEPSC amplitude, both for the GFP control group alone (Figure 3A, n = 26, r2 = 0.18, p < 0.05) and for neurons from all experimental conditions combined (Figure 3B, n = 101, r2 = 0.13, p < 0.001). Dividing neurons according to TDBL yielded four groups with descending average mEPSC amplitudes (Figure 3C), further demonstrating the inverse relationship between TDBL and mEPSC amplitude. A critical question for any results obtained using dissociated neuronal cultures is whether the experimental manipulations have the same effects in vivo. To test whether β-catenin overexpression in vivo promotes dendritic growth and reduces mEPSC amplitudes two different approaches were used. First, we electroporated a plasmid expressing β-catenin∗ together with YFP in utero into the ventricles of mice embryos and recorded spontaneous EPSCs from acute brain slices prepared from postnatal mice. β-catenin∗ expressing neurons had lower sEPSC amplitudes (6.96 ± 0.41 pA, n = 5, p < 0.05) compared to neighboring controls (13.80 ± 1.83 pA, n = 11; Figure 4A). Furthermore, neurons expression β-catenin∗ together with YFP had higher TDBL (control, 319.89 ± 15.98 μm, n = 58; β-cat∗, 387.59 ± 18.02 μm, n = 61, p = 0.01; Figure 4B) and TDBTN (control, 10.78 ± 0.65, n = 58; β-cat∗, 12.93 ± 0.61, n = 61, p < 0.005; Figure 4C) compared to controls expressing YFP alone. These results demonstrate that in vivo expression of β-catenin from late embryonic development has qualitatively the same effects as its expression in dissociated neuronal cultures. To examine whether expression of β-catenin in vivo during postnatal development has effects similar to those when expressed embryonically, we injected Sindbis viruses expressing β-catenin∗ directly into the hippocampus of juvenile rats (P21–P28) and recorded from infected neurons in acute brain slices prepared 24 hr later. Again, neurons expressing β-catenin∗ had reduced mEPSC amplitudes (9.60 ± 0.43 pA, n = 9, p < 0.01) compared to neighboring control cells (12.33 ± 0.57 pA, n = 7; Figure 4D). Similar to the results obtained from dissociated neuronal cultures, the cumulative probability distributions of mEPSC amplitudes were also significantly different (Figure 4E, p < 0.0005) and could be superimposed when the distribution from the β-catenin∗ expressing cells was transformed according to a best fit equation (Figure 4E, inset). The amplitudes of mEPSCs most likely reflect the number and state of surface AMPA receptors at individual synapses, although changes in transmitter concentration can influence this parameter (Lisman et al., 2007Lisman J.E. Raghavachari S. Tsien R.W. The sequence of events that underlie quantal transmission at central glutamatergic synapses.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 597-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore we used immunocytochemistry as an alternative method for assaying the level of synaptic surface AMPA receptors. This standard method also provides an independent test of the electrophysiological results and circumvents any issues related to potential space clamping artifacts. Consistent with the electrophysiological results, expression of β-catenin∗ reduced the area of both total surface AMPA receptors and surface AMPA receptors at synapses, defined by colocalization with the active zone marker protein Bassoon (Figures 5A and 5B, β-cat∗, 92.97 ± 1.40, n = 56, p < 0.01 compared to GFP alone, 100 ± 2.06, n = 57; Figure 5C, 89.58 ± 1.97, p = 0.001; Figure S4A). Consistent with previous work (O'Brien et al., 1998O'Brien R.J. Kamboj S. Ehlers M.D. Rosen K.R. Fischbach G.D. Huganir R.L. Activity-dependent modulation of synaptic AMPA receptor accumulation.Neuron. 1998; 21: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), treating cultures with high K+ to mimic a chronic increase in activity also decreased total surface (Figure 5B, K+, 90.12 ± 2.15, n = 59, p = 0.001) and synaptic surface AMPA receptors (Figure 5C, 87.01 ± 3.97, p = 0.001). These decreases were reversed by expression of N(intra) [Figure 5B, K+ + N(intra), 96.74 ± 2.01, n = 57, p = 0.26 versus GFP, p < 0.05 versus K+; Figure 5C, 96.31 ± 2.54, p = 0.30 versus GFP, p < 0.05 versus K+), while expression of N(intra) alone had no effect (Figures 5B and 5C). No changes were detected in the average puncta intensity or percentage of surface synaptic AMPA receptors (Figures S4B–S4D), further confirming that the observed changes in AMPA receptor cluster size represent bona fide changes in surface AMPA receptor levels. Although the effects of β-catenin∗ expression or depolarization on surface AMPA receptor puncta size were statistically significant, they were small relative to the effects of these manipulations on mEPSC amplitudes. We therefore hypothesized that in addition to reducing the size of surface AMPA receptor clusters, these manipulations may bring a proportion of AMPA receptor clusters below immunocytochemical detection threshold. This would be reflected as a decrease in the number of total and synaptic surface AMPA receptor clusters per unit length of dendrite. Consistent with this prediction, neurons expressing β-catenin∗ or treated with K+ exhibited a clear decrease in surface AMPA receptor density (Figure 5D, β-cat∗, 10.33 ± 0.77, p = 0.01, K+, 8.56 ± 0.91, p < 0.0005 versus GFP, 13.15 ± 0.80; Figure 5E, β-cat∗, 5.10 ± 0.34, p < 0.0005, K+, 5.03 ± 0.53, p = 0.001 versus GFP, 7.42 ± 0.50). Again, expression of N(intra) reversed the effects of K+ on both total and synaptic surface AMPA receptor puncta density (Figure 5D, K+ + N(intra), 12.98 ± 1.19, p = 0.91 versus GFP, p < 0.005 versus K+; Figure 5E, 7.27 ± 0.63, p = 0.86 versus GFP, p < 0.01 versus K+) while N(intra) expression alone had no detectable effects (Figures 5D and 5E). Together, the decrease in the puncta size of the average surface AMPA receptor cluster (Figures 5B and 5C), combined with the decrease in receptor density (Figures 5D and 5E), results in a significant reduction in surface AMPA receptor levels per unit length of dendrite, in neurons expressing β-catenin∗ or treated with K+. A body of work suggests important roles for the cadherin/catenin complex in synapse development (Dalva et al., 2007Dalva M.B. McClelland A.C. Kayser M.S. Cell adhesion molecules: signalling functions at the synapse.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 206-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, Salinas and Price, 2005Salinas P.C. Price S.R. Cadherins and catenins in synapse development.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Yet, we have observed that β-catenin overexpression reduces mEPSC amplitude and frequency (Figures 2 and S1; see Discussion) as well as surface AMPA receptor puncta size and density (Figures 5A–5E). These results raise the question of how β-catenin overexpression affects synapse density. To address this issue, we identified synapses by colabeling for the postsynaptic density protein PSD95 and the presynaptic active zone protein Piccolo, two structural synaptic marker proteins (McAllister, 2007McAllister A.K. Dynamic aspects of CNS synapse formation.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 425-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, Waites et al., 2005Waites C.L. Craig A.M. Garner C.C. Mechanisms of vertebrate synaptogenesis.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 251-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Neither β-catenin overexpression nor any of the other manipulations affected the density of total or synaptic PSD95 and Piccolo puncta (Figures 5F–5I), nor did they affect the percentage of PSD95 and Piccolo puncta (data not shown) that were synaptic, as defined by colocalization with respect to each other. These results demonstrate that although β-catenin overexpression decreased mEPSC amplitude and surface AMPA receptor cluster size and density, it did not affect the density of morphological synapses. Furthermore, these results suggest that as dendritic arbors grow, the density of morphological synapses, as defined by colocalization of active zone and postsynaptic density proteins, is kept roughly constant. The decrease in AMPA receptor puncta density with no changes in synapse density (as defined by PSD-95 and Piccolo staining) in cells expressing β-catenin∗ or following high K+ treatment is consistent with the hypothesis that these manipulations increase the proportion of silent synapses (Durand et al., 1996Durand G.M.

https://openalex.org/W2149408556,"Nestin is a molecular marker for neural progenitor cells. Rat and human nestin genes possess a central nervous system-specific enhancer within their second introns. However, the transcription factors that bind to the nestin enhancer have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that the second intron of the mouse nestin gene is sufficient to drive reporter gene expression in the developing nervous system. The core sequence of this central nervous system-specific enhancer localizes to the 3' 320-bp region. The cis-elements for Sox and POU family transcription factors and the hormone-responsive element are essential for nestin expression during embryonic carcinoma P19 cell neural differentiation and in the developing chick neural tube. Interestingly, different transcription factors bind to the nestin enhancer at different stages of P19 cell neural differentiation and central nervous system development. Sox2 and SF1 may mediate basal nestin expression in undifferentiated P19EC cells, whereas Sox2, Brn1, and Brn2 bind to the enhancer in P19 neural progenitor cells. Similarly, in vivo, Oct1 binds to the nestin enhancer in embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) mouse embryos, and Oct1, Brn1, and Brn2 bind to this enhancer in E10.5 and E12.5 mouse embryos. Our studies therefore suggest a temporal coordination of transcription factors in determining nestin gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1975960603,"Neuroanatomical and functional asymmetries are universal features of the vertebrate CNS, but how asymmetry is generated is unknown. Here we show that zebrafish fgf8 mutants do not elaborate forebrain asymmetries, demonstrated by the failure of the parapineal nucleus to migrate from its initial midline position to the left side of the brain. Local provision of Fgf8 restores the asymmetric migration of parapineal cells, usually to the left, irrespective of the location of the Fgf8 source. This laterality bias is due to left-sided Nodal signaling and when the bias in Nodal signaling is removed, parapineal cells migrate toward the source of Fgf8 protein. This study presents a mechanism for breaking neuroanatomical symmetry through Fgf8-dependent regulation of bistable left- or right-sided migration of the parapineal. The combined action of Fgf and Nodal signals ensures the establishment of neuroanatomical asymmetries with consistent laterality."

Here, we found that neuronal AMPA receptors and recombinant AMPA receptors coexpressed with stargazin autoinactivate at high concentrations of glutamate, whereas recombinant AMPA receptors expressed alone do not. The reduction of currents at high glutamate concentrations is not associated with a reduction of AMPA receptor number, but rather with the loss of stargazin-associated allosteric modulation of channel gating.

Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and acts on three classes of ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPA, NMDA, and kainate), which function distinctly (Dingledine et al., 1999Dingledine R.

AMPA receptors are hetero-oligomers composed of four subunits, GluR1-4 (Hollmann and Heinemann, 1994Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Cloned glutamate receptors.Annu. Rev.

Channels composed of different AMPA receptor subunits display quantitative differences in the kinetics of deactivation (channel closure upon glutamate removal) and desensitization (channel closure during continuous exposure to glutamate) (Jonas and Spruston, 1994Jonas P.

Although the rules that determine the trafficking of heteromeric AMPA receptors remain uncertain, the subunit composition of AMPA receptors also influences the number of synaptic AMPA receptors under basal and activity-dependent conditions (Barry and Ziff, 2002Barry M.F.

In addition, TARP γ-8 knockout mice have altered AMPA receptor trafficking and AMPA receptor activity in the hippocampus (Fukaya et al., 2006Fukaya M. Tsujita M. Yamazaki M. Kushiya E. Abe K.

Neuronal AMPA receptors have different properties from recombinant AMPA receptors. For example, neuronal AMPA receptors respond to kainate better than glutamate, whereas recombinant AMPA receptors respond to glutamate better than kainate. This discrepancy has been resolved by coexpressing AMPA receptors with TARPs in recombinant systems, which results in a robust enhancement of kainate efficacy (Kott et al., 2007Kott S. Werner M.

Patneau D.K. Stargazin modulates native AMPA receptor functional properties by two distinct mechanisms.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7438-7448Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, glutamate-evoked steady-state current from cells expressing recombinant AMPA receptors have typical sigmoid concentration-response curves (Hollmann and Heinemann, 1994Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Cloned glutamate receptors.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3587) Google Scholar, Robert and Howe, 2003Robert A. Howe J.R. How AMPA receptor desensitization depends on receptor occupancy.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 847-858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the responses from AMPA receptors in the avian cochlear nucleus and oocytes injected with polyA RNA from the rat cerebral cortex show a bell-shaped concentration-response, where the amplitude of the steady-state current declines at glutamate concentrations above 100 μM (Geoffroy et al., 1991Geoffroy M. Lambolez B. Audinat E. Hamon B. Crepel F. Rossier J. Kado R.T. Reduction of desensitization of a glutamate ionotropic receptor by antagonists.Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 587-591PubMed Google Scholar, Raman and Trussell, 1992Raman I.M. Trussell L.O.

Vyklicky L. Vyklicky Jr., L. Vyskocil F. The action of excitatory amino acids on chick spinal cord neurones in culture.J. Physiol. 1987; 386: 425-438PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms that give rise to these different concentration-response relationships remain unclear. In this study, we have examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the autoinactivation of neuronal AMPA receptors. We found that AMPA receptors in mouse cerebellar granule cells, like the avian cochlear nucleus, also display reduced steady-state currents at glutamate concentrations above 100 μM, demonstrating that this is also a feature of mammalian receptors in neurons. Whereas expression of AMPA receptors alone in Xenopus laevis oocytes did not result in autoinactivated bell-shaped curves, such curves were obtained upon coexpression of AMPA receptors with stargazin. Although stargazin modulates all AMPA receptor subunits, the magnitude of the stargazin-related reductions in the amplitude of currents evoked by high concentrations of glutamate depended on subunit composition and differed for flip and flop splicing isoforms of AMPA receptors. Our results show that high concentrations of glutamate promote the dissociation of stargazin from AMPA receptors, an effect that occurs within a few milliseconds after receptor desensitization and requires the cytoplasmic domain of AMPA receptors. Furthermore, we found that this autoinactivation mechanism contributes to short-term modulation of AMPA receptor activity at synapses. The novel mechanism described here could tune synaptic transmission upon neuronal activation or under conditions where ambient levels of glutamate are elevated. Previous studies have shown that AMPA receptors have a bell-shaped glutamate concentration-response curve in neurons from the avian cochlear nucleus, where the amplitude of the steady-state current declined at glutamate concentrations above 100 μM, so called “autoinactivation” (Raman and Trussell, 1992Raman I.M. Trussell L.O. The kinetics of the response to glutamate and kainate in neurons of the avian cochlear nucleus.Neuron. 1992; 9: 173-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, Vlachova et al., 1987Vlachova V. Vyklicky L. Vyklicky Jr., L. Vyskocil F. The action of excitatory amino acids on chick spinal cord neurones in culture.J. Physiol. 1987; 386: 425-438PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether mammalian AMPA receptors show similar characteristics, we measured glutamate-evoked whole-cell currents in mouse cerebellar granule cells. Glutamate was applied in the continuous presence of cyclothiazide (CTZ), which selectively reduces desensitization of AMPA receptor flip splicing isoforms (and to a lesser extent flop isoforms; Partin et al., 1994Partin K.M. Patneau D.K. Mayer M.L. Cyclothiazide differentially modulates desensitization of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor splice variants.Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 129-138PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, currents were detected at glutamate concentrations of 3 μM. At concentrations of 50 μM and below, the currents did not decline during 5 s applications. At glutamate concentrations of 100 μM and above, the initial amplitude of the response faded (Figure 1A). Plots of the mean initial amplitude of the currents against glutamate concentration gave typical sigmoid concentration-response relationships and EC50 values of approximately 20 μM (data not shown). Whereas the peak amplitudes of whole-cell currents evoked by 1000 μM glutamate were larger than those by 50 μM glutamate (ratio: 1.41 ± 0.07, n = 12), steady-state currents were consistently and significantly smaller than the corresponding currents obtained with 50 μM glutamate (Figures 1A and 1D). To examine the mechanisms that underlie the reduction in the amplitude of steady-state AMPA-receptor currents at near-saturating concentrations of glutamate, we used Xenopus laevis oocytes as a model system (Chen et al., 2003Chen L. El-Husseini A. Tomita S. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Stargazin differentially controls the trafficking of alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate and kainate receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In oocytes expressing the flop isoform of the GluR1 AMPA-receptor subunit (GluR1o) alone, the steady-state currents evoked by 1000 μM glutamate were larger than the currents evoked by 5 μM glutamate or 10 μM kainate (Figures 1B and 1D). Because native AMPA receptors in cerebellar granule cells contain the prototypical TARP stargazin (Chen et al., 2000Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Stargazin regulates synaptic targeting of AMPA receptors by two distinct mechanisms.Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we coexpressed stargazin and GluR1o in oocytes to better mimic native receptors. In contrast to GluR1o alone, oocytes coexpressing GluR1o and stargazin gave larger responses to 5 μM glutamate than to 1000 μM glutamate (Figures 1C and 1D). Similar effects of stargazin coexpression were seen for the GluR1 flip isoform (GluR1i; Figure 1D), and stargazin enhanced kainate-evoked currents from oocytes expressing both the flip and flop isoforms of GluR1 (Figures 1C and 1E), as reported previously (Kott et al., 2007Kott S. Werner M. Korber C. Hollmann M. Electrophysiological properties of AMPA receptors are differentially modulated depending on the associated member of the TARP family.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 3780-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, Tomita et al., 2005aTomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W. Wada K. Howe J.R. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Stargazin modulates AMPA receptor gating and trafficking by distinct domains.Nature. 2005; 435: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, Turetsky et al., 2005Turetsky D. Garringer E. Patneau D.K. Stargazin modulates native AMPA receptor functional properties by two distinct mechanisms.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7438-7448Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We also found that stargazin decreased significantly the steady-state current ratio for 1000 μM and 5 μM glutamate. This effect of stargazin was seen without calcium in the extracellular recording solution (Figure 1F) and was reproduced for other AMPA receptor isoforms, although the responses to 1000 μM glutamate were still larger than those to 5 μM for the GluR2 flip isoform (Figure 1G). The results suggest that whether neuronal AMPA receptors show autoinactivated bell-shaped concentration-response curves may depend on the repertoire of AMPA receptor isoforms expressed. However, for all AMPA receptor subunits examined, modulation of gating behavior by stargazin depends on glutamate concentration. It is well established that stargazin is involved in AMPA receptor trafficking (Nicoll et al., 2006Nicoll R.A. Tomita S. Bredt D.S. Auxiliary subunits assist AMPA-type glutamate receptors.Science. 2006; 311: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, Ziff, 2007Ziff E.B. TARPs and the AMPA receptor trafficking paradox.Neuron. 2007; 53: 627-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether the reduction in current amplitudes at high glutamate concentrations was due to a reduction in the number of AMPA receptors at the cell surface. In oocytes coexpressing extracellularly HA-epitope tagged GluR1 and stargazin, we measured the surface expression of AMPA receptors in the absence or continuous presence of glutamate using chemiluminescence assays (Tomita et al., 2005aTomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W. Wada K. Howe J.R. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Stargazin modulates AMPA receptor gating and trafficking by distinct domains.Nature. 2005; 435: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The surface expression of HA-GluR1i was not altered by glutamate application (Figure 2A). We then correlated the glutamate-evoked current at two different glutamate concentrations (10 μM and 500 μM) to the amount of receptors on the cell surface in the presence or absence of stargazin (Figures 2B and 2C). This allowed us to compare the size of glutamate-evoked currents with and without stargazin in oocytes with the same number of surface receptors. For both GluR1 flip and flop receptors, coexpression of stargazin increased the amplitude of currents evoked by 10 μM glutamate but not 500 μM glutamate (Figures 2B and 2C). To identify the AMPA receptor domains required for the reduced stargazin-mediated modulation of steady-state currents at high concentrations of glutamate, we constructed chimeric receptors in which regions of the AMPA receptor GluR1o and the kainate receptor GluR6 (which does not interact with stargazin (Chen et al., 2003Chen L. El-Husseini A. Tomita S. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Stargazin differentially controls the trafficking of alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate and kainate receptors.Mol.

AMPA receptors and stargazin-like transmembrane AMPA receptor-regulatory proteins mediate hippocampal kainate neurotoxicity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 18784-18788Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)) were exchanged (Figure 3A). We coexpressed the chimeras with stargazin in oocytes and measured the ratio of currents evoked by 1000 μM and 5 μM glutamate. This ratio was less than 1 for each of the chimeras except for receptors in which the cytoplasmic tail of GluR1 was replaced with the corresponding domain from GluR6 (6Cyto). The 6Cyto chimera gave 1000 μM/5 μM ratios that were not significantly different from the corresponding ratios obtained for GluR1o receptors without stargazin coexpression (Figure 3A). Furthermore, replacing the GluR1 ligand-binding domain with that from GluR6 (6S1S2) resulted in robust reduction of the ratio of currents evoked by 1000 μM and 5 μM glutamate in the presence of stargazin (Figure 3A), whereas in the absence of stargazin both 6S1S2 and 6Cyto gave larger responses to 1000 μM glutamate than to 5 μM glutamate. Stargazin increased both the kainate efficacy and the surface expression of the 6Cyto chimera, demonstrating that the 6Cyto chimera interacts with stargazin (Figures 3B and 3C). Similar effects were observed for a chimeric construct in which the flip isoform of GluR1 was used (6Cyto(R1i); Figure 3D). In addition, deletion of the N-terminal domain of the AMPA receptors (ΔNTD) did not alter the effects of stargazin on kainate efficacy (Tomita et al., 2007bTomita S. Shenoy A. Fukata Y. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Stargazin interacts functionally with the AMPA receptor glutamate-binding module.Neuropharmacology. 2007; 52: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) nor the concentration-dependent modulation of glutamate responses (Figure S1). The results with the 6Cyto chimeras show that the cytoplasmic tail of GluR1 is required for glutamate concentration dependent modulation of stargazin-mediated AMPA receptor activity, and the results with the 6S1S2 chimera suggest that this modulation is influenced by conformational changes that occur at the level of the ligand-binding domain. Because the effect of stargazin to potentiate AMPA receptor activity was reduced at high concentrations of glutamate (Figures 2B and 2C), we hypothesized that stargazin does not interact with AMPA receptors under these conditions. Indeed, previous coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that prolonged exposure of purified TARP γ-3/AMPA receptor complexes to 100 μM glutamate reduced the association of the related TARP isoform γ-3 with native AMPA receptors (Tomita et al., 2004Tomita S. Fukata M. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Dynamic interaction of stargazin-like TARPs with cycling AMPA receptors at synapses.Science. 2004; 303: 1508-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that glutamate promotes the dissociation of stargazin, stargazin/GluR1 complexes were immunopurified with anti-stargazin antibody from oocytes coexpressing GluR1 and stargazin, followed by the addition of glutamate to the immunocomplexes. We found that glutamate caused the dissociation of GluR1 AMPA receptors from stargazin, an effect that was blocked by the competitive AMPA-receptor antagonist CNQX (Figure 4A). Similar results were obtained from brain homogenates (Figure S2A). Importantly, the same glutamate treatment of immunocomplexes containing stargazin and 6Cyto did not cause dissociation (Figure 4A), supporting the idea that glutamate-induced dissociation of stargazin is responsible for the reduced steady-state currents seen at high concentrations of glutamate. The glutamate-mediated dissociation of stargazin and GluR1 depended on glutamate concentration, with a mean effective concentration of 16 μM (Figure 4B). Since AMPA receptor currents evoked by kainate did not show bell-shaped concentration-response curves when AMPA receptors were coexpressed with stargazin (Tomita et al., 2007bTomita S. Shenoy A. Fukata Y. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Stargazin interacts functionally with the AMPA receptor glutamate-binding module.Neuropharmacology. 2007; 52: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we also examined the effect of kainate in coimmunoprecipitation assays and found that kainate did not result in the dissociation of GluR1 and stargazin (Figures S2B and S2C). The dissociation curve in Figure 4B allowed us to calculate the fraction of stargazin bound to AMPA receptors at different concentrations of glutamate and to simulate glutamate concentration-response curves for AMPA receptors when they are coexpressed with stargazin (Figure 4C). Recombinant GluR1o channels showed a typical sigmoid curve, with an EC50 of about 10 μM and a Hill coefficient close to 1 (Figures 4C and 4D, inset). Stargazin coexpression decreases the glutamate EC50 value for steady-state currents about 5-fold (Kott et al., 2007Kott S. Werner M. Korber C. Hollmann M.

We found that SEPT9, and its interacting partners SEPT2 and SEPT11, are recruited as collars next to actin at the site of entry of Listeria and Shigella. SEPT2-depletion by siRNA decreased bacterial invasion, suggesting that septins have roles during particle entry. Incubating cells with InlB-coated beads confirmed an essential role for SEPT2. Moreover, SEPT2-depletion impaired InlB-mediated stimulation of Met-dependent signaling as shown by FRET.

Smells evoke attraction and repulsion responses, reflecting the hedonic value of the odorant. While olfactory preferences are known to be strongly modulated by experience and learning, it has been recently suggested that, in humans, the pleasantness of odors may be partly explained by the physicochemical properties of the odorant molecules themselves. If odor hedonic value is indeed predetermined by odorant structure, then it could be hypothesized that other species will show similar odor preferences to humans. Combining behavioral and psychophysical approaches, we here show that odorants rated as pleasant by humans were also those which, behaviorally, mice investigated longer and human subjects sniffed longer, thereby revealing for the first time a component of olfactory hedonic perception conserved across species. Consistent with this, we further show that odor pleasantness rating in humans and investigation time in mice were both correlated with the physicochemical properties of the molecules, suggesting that olfactory preferences are indeed partly engraved in the physicochemical structure of the odorant. That odor preferences are shared between mammal species and are guided by physicochemical features of odorant stimuli strengthens the view that odor preference is partially predetermined. These findings open up new perspectives for the study of the neural mechanisms of hedonic perception."
https://openalex.org/W1973389622,"Laminins are major cell-adhesive proteins in basement membranes that are capable of binding to integrins. Laminins consist of three chains (alpha, beta, and gamma), in which three laminin globular modules in the alpha chain and the Glu residue in the C-terminal tail of the gamma chain have been shown to be prerequisites for binding to integrins. However, it remains unknown whether any part of the beta chain is involved in laminin-integrin interactions. We compared the binding affinities of pairs of laminin isoforms containing the beta1 or beta2 chain toward a panel of laminin-binding integrins, and we found that beta2 chain-containing laminins (beta2-laminins) bound more avidly to alpha3beta1 and alpha7X2beta1 integrins than beta1 chain-containing laminins (beta1-laminins), whereas alpha6beta1, alpha6beta4, and alpha7X1beta1 integrins did not show any preference toward beta2-laminins. Because alpha3beta1 contains the ""X2-type"" variable region in the alpha3 subunit and alpha6beta1 and alpha6beta4 contain the ""X1-type"" region in the alpha6 subunit, we hypothesized that only integrins containing the X2-type region were capable of discriminating between beta1-laminins and beta2-laminins. In support of this possibility, a putative X2-type variant of alpha6beta1 was produced and found to bind preferentially to beta2-laminins. Production of a series of swap mutants between the beta1 and beta2 chains revealed that the C-terminal 20 amino acids in the coiled-coil domain were responsible for the enhanced integrin binding by beta2-laminins. Taken together, the results provide evidence that the C-terminal region of beta chains is involved in laminin recognition by integrins and modulates the binding affinities of laminins toward X2-type integrins."

We have identified A1120, a high affinity (Ki = 8.3 nm) non-retinoid ligand for RBP4, which disrupts the interaction between RBP4 and its binding partner transthyretin. Analysis of the RBP4-A1120 co-crystal structure reveals that A1120 induces critical conformational changes at the RBP4-transthyretin interface. Administration of A1120 to mice lowers serum RBP4 and retinol levels but, unexpectedly, does not improve insulin sensitivity. In addition, we show that Rpb4-/- mice display normal insulin sensitivity and are not protected from high fat diet-induced insulin resistance. We conclude that lowering RBP4 levels does not improve insulin sensitivity in mice. Therefore, RBP4 lowering may not be an effective strategy for treating diabetes.

Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. vol. 2. Academic Press, New York1984: 41-88Crossref Google Scholar). The majority of RBP4 is expressed in the liver, with ∼15–20% expressed in adipose (2Makover A. Soprano D.R. Wyatt M.L. Goodman D.S. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 171-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the serum, RBP4 is present as a complex with transthyretin (TTR), which effectively increases the molecular weight of RBP4 and protects it from glomerular filtration. Thus disruption of the RBP4·TTR complex in vivo by administration of the synthetic retinoid fenretinide (N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide) results in a rapid reduction in serum RBP4 levels (3Peng Y.M. Dalton W.S. Alberts D.S. Xu M.J. Lim H. Meyskens Jr., F.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4Berni R. Formelli F. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 43-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although the major physiological ligand for RBP4 appears to be retinol, RBP4 can bind to other endogenous and synthetic retinoids. For example, using biochemical assays, RBP4 has been shown to bind to retinol, all-trans- and 13-cis-retinoic acid, retinyl acetate, N-(ethyl)retinamide, and fenretinide (4Berni R. Formelli F. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 43-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Berni R. Clerici M. Malpeli G. Cleris L. Formelli F.

In addition, x-ray diffraction analysis of a variety of RBP4-retinoid co-crystal structures has demonstrated that these retinoids bind to the same site as retinol, with the cyclohexene ring buried within the internal cavity and the polar head group pointing toward the exterior of the protein (7Cowan S.W. Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. Proteins. 1990; 8: 44-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 8Zanotti G. Malpeli G. Berni R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29613-29620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The loop regions of RBP4 surrounding the entrance of the binding cavity form the binding site for TTR, with the binding of retinol (in particular the presence of the hydroxyl group) increasing the affinity of RBP4 for TTR by a factor of ∼4 (10Monaco H.L. Rizzi M. Coda A. Science. 1995; 268: 1039-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The binding of fenretinide, however, has the opposite effect. Through a combination of steric hindrance (from the bulky phenylamide head group) and changes in the position of the loop regions of RBP4 located at the TTR binding interface, fenretinide completely disrupts the binding of RBP4 to TTR (4Berni R. Formelli F. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 43-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 9Zanotti G. Marcello M. Malpeli G. Folli C. Sartori G. Berni R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29613-29620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports have suggested that, in addition to its role in vitamin A transport, RBP4 may also be involved in the development of insulin resistance. For example, Yang et al. reported that mice overexpressing an RBP4 transgene and mice injected with recombinant RBP4 protein become insulin-resistant, and that reduction of RBP4 levels in mice either by gene ablation or treatment with fenretinide improves insulin sensitivity (11Yang Q. Graham T.E. Mody N. Preitner F. Peroni O.D. Zabolotny J.M. Kotani K. Quadro L. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2005; 436: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). In humans, Graham et al. showed that elevated serum RBP4 levels are correlated with the magnitude of insulin resistance in subjects with obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2 diabetes (12Graham T.E. Yang Q. Bluher M. Hammarstedt A. Ciaraldi T.P. Henry R.R. Wason C.J. Oberbach A. Jansson P.A. Smith U. Kahn B.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 354: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). This has been confirmed by some studies (13Balagopal P. Graham T.E. Kahn B.B. Altomare A. Funanage V. George D. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

To further understand the involvement of RBP4 in insulin resistance, we conducted a high throughput screen to identify non-retinoid ligands for RBP4. We report here the identification and characterization of A1120, a non-retinoid small molecule that binds with high affinity to RBP4 and displaces TTR from an RBP4·TTR complex. The co-crystal structure of A1120 with RBP4 shows that A1120 binds to the same site as retinol and induces changes in the orientation (compared with the retinol bound form) of loops at the RBP4·TTR interaction interface. When administered to mice, A1120 lowers RBP4 and retinol levels in a dose-dependent manner, to a similar extent as seen with fenretinide. However, unlike fenretinide, A1120 does not have beneficial effects on insulin resistance. In addition, our experiments show that Rpb4-/- mice are not resistant to high fat diet-induced insulin resistance and are indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates with respect to insulin sensitivity. These results suggest that the insulin-sensitizing effects of fenretinide are not mediated by RBP4 and indicate that lowering RBP4 levels does not significantly improve the diabetic state in mice. Synthesis of A1120-A solution of methyl 2-isocyanatobenzoate (10.00 g, 56.4 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (30 ml) was slowly added to a solution of 4-(2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)piperidine hydrochloride (14.3 g, 53.8 mmol, Sigma) and triethylamine 99% (8.99 ml, 64.5 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (120 ml) at 0 °C. The mixture was removed from the cooling bath and stirred at room temperature for 15 min, at which time LC/MS analysis indicated that the reaction was complete. EtOH (75 ml) and aqueous LiOH (2N, 95 ml) were then added, and the solution was stirred for 6 h at room temperature. Subsequently, aqueous HCl (2N, 150 ml) was added, and the resulting mixture was extracted with EtOAc (2 × 600 ml). The EtOAc extract was dried over MgSO4 and concentrated to an off-white solid. Recrystallization from EtOAc yielded 14.0 g (66%) of 2-(4-(2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)piperidine-1-carboxamido) benzoic acid as a white solid, which was homogeneous by analytical high-performance liquid chromatography (>99%): mp: 156.3–157.1 °C; MS electrospray ionization (pos.) m/e: 393.0 (M+H)+ (calcd. for C20H20F3N2O3, 393.1); 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ ppm 13.55 (1H, br.s.), 10.97 (1 H, s), 8.43 (1H, d, J = 7.8 Hz), 7.96 (1H, dd, J = 7.8, 2.0 Hz), 7.51–7.71 (4H, m), 7.41 (1 H, t, J = 7.6 Hz), 7.01 (3 H, dd, J = 15.3, 1.2 Hz), 4.17–4.28 (2 H, m), 2.96–3.14 (3H, m), 1.69–1.83 (4H, m); 13C NMR (101 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ ppm, 170.43, 153.55, 144.23, 143.30, 134.05, 132.80, 130.96, 128.66, 126.67, 120.49, 118.89, 114.57, 44.09, 38.10, and 32.75. Biochemical Assays-The RBP4 scintillation proximity and FRET assays were performed as described previously (21Coward P. Conn M. Tang J. Xiong F. Menjares A. Reagan J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2009; 384: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). CRBP1 pENTR 221 cDNA was purchased from Invitrogen and subcloned into pET300/NT-DEST (Invitrogen). Soluble recombinant His-tagged protein was made in Escherichia coli, purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), and biotinylated as described for RBP4 (21Coward P. Conn M. Tang J. Xiong F. Menjares A. Reagan J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2009; 384: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The CRBP1 scintillation proximity assay was performed as described for RBP4. Protein Preparation and Crystallization-The protein preparation was carried out as described (22Greene L.H. Chrysina E.D. Irons L.I. Papageorgiou A.C. Acharya K.R. Brew K. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2301-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In brief, the truncated form of human RBP4 (residues 19–201) was cloned into a pET21a vector (Novagen) by PCR. The recombinant protein with a N-terminal His6 tag was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen), grown in 2×YT medium (Sigma) at 30 °C and induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h before harvesting. Inclusion bodies containing recombinant RBP4 were isolated by centrifugation and washed once with 1% Triton and then twice with cold water. The protein was solubilized in 7 m guanidine HCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and then diluted to 1 mg/ml with 5 m guanidine HCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5. Refolding of RBP4 was carried out by rapid, 10-fold dilution in refolding buffer (0.5 m guanidine HCl, 4 mm GSH, and 0.4 mm oxidized glutathione, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9), followed by a gel filtration over Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was further purified by anion exchange over Mono Q (Amersham Biosciences), followed by cation exchange over Mono S (Amersham Biosciences). The Mono S eluant was then applied to a Superdex 75 column and eluted in a buffer of 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein was then concentrated to 15 mg/ml for crystallization. The RBP4 co-crystals with A1120 were grown at 16 °C in a sitting drop with 1.3 μl of the protein solution and 1.3 μl of the well solution containing 0.4 m magnesium formate, 0.1 m guanidine HCl, 0.1 m Bis-Tris, pH 6.5. The crystals were transferred into the mother liquor with additional 10% glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement- The x-ray diffraction data set for the A1120-RBP4 co-crystal was collected on a synchrotron radiation beamline (5.0.2) at the Advanced Light Source in Berkeley, CA, to a resolution of 2.9 Å. The data were integrated using MOSFLM (23Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar) and scaled in CCP4 (24Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement with PHASER (25McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14567) Google Scholar) using a previously published retinol binding protein structure (PDB code: 1RBP) as a search model. Several rounds of model building were done using Quanta (Accelrys). The program REFMAC (26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) in CCP4 was used for structural refinement. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank under accession code 3FMZ. Serum RBP4 and Retinol Measurements-Serum RBP4 was measured using the Dual Mouse/Rat RBP4 ELISA kit from AdipoGen (Seoul, South Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To measure serum retinol, samples were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline, and aliquots (50 μl) were extracted with 3 volumes of acetonitrile containing internal standard. After vortexing and centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and subjected to reversed-phase liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry with a Cohesive LX2 system (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) connected inline with a Sciex API 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The LX2 system consisted of Agilent 1200 pumps and a CTC autosampler. The LC column was a Shiseido Capcell PAK UG C18 (50 × 2.0 mm, 3 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) maintained at 40 °C. Mobile phases were: A, 0.1% formic acid in water; and B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The LC gradient started with 5% B for 1 min, and then ramped to 60% B in 1 min followed by a linear increase to 95% B over 2 min, and held at 95% B for 1 min. The flow rate was 0.6 ml/min. Samples were maintained at 10 °C in the autosampler. MS detection was carried out in positive ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring. Source parameters were as follows: ion spray voltage, 5500 V; curtain gas, 20; collision gas, 6; ion source for gases 1 and 2, 50; and temperature, 550 °C. The multiple reaction monitoring transitions used for quantification were m/z 269.3 → 92.9 (retinol) and 435.2 → 264.3 (calibration standard). For retinol, [M+H-18]+ was selected by Q1 monitoring due to its in-source loss of water. Calibration standards were prepared separately by spiking the standard into phosphate-buffered saline, followed by sample extraction as described above. The concentrations of quality control standards were 10, 100, and 1000 μg/liter. Calibration curves were obtained by regression of peak area ratios (analyte to internal standard) versus the theoretical concentrations of the plasma calibration standards. In Vivo Experiments-Male B6D2F1 mice (4–5 weeks of age, Harlan, IN) were maintained on irradiated normal chow (Teklad 2918) or high fat diet (BioservS1850, 60kCal% fat, Frenchtown, NJ) and supplied with drinking water purified by reverse osmosis. Animals were housed in a room adjusted to a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle beginning at 0600 and 1800, respectively. Animal holding room temperature and humidity were in conformance with the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (National Research Council, National Academy Press, Washington, D. C., 1996), and studies were performed in accordance with Amgen Inc. “Research and Development Laboratory Animal Care and Use Policy” and under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For acute studies, non-fasted, chow fed mice (8–10 weeks of age) were administered test articles prepared in 1% Tween 80, 1% methylcellulose in autoclaved milliQ water at the indicated doses in a volume of 10 ml/kg. For non-terminal sampling, blood was collected from conscious animals via a tail nick. For terminal samples, mice were decapitated without anesthesia, and whole blood was collected for isolation of serum by centrifugation. For oral glucose tolerance and insulin suppression tests, mice were fasted for 4 h from the start of the light cycle (6 a.m.). Mice were then challenged with glucose (2 g/10 ml/kg per os) or insulin (1 U/10 ml/kg, intraperitoneally), and blood was sampled via tail nick at the indicated time points. Blood glucose levels were determined directly in whole blood by glucometer (Accu-Chek, Roche Applied Science) or in serum by colorimetric assay (Glucose Trinder, Sigma). Insulin was determined in serum by ELISA (Ultrasensitive Mouse Insulin, ALPCO Diagnostics). For chronic treatment studies, test articles were prepared as food admixture based on pre-determined average daily food intake. Mice fed a high fat diet for 6 weeks (diet-induced obese mice) were randomized into treatment groups based on fed state body weight, glucose, and insulin levels. Age-matched mice on chow diet were used as controls. Body weight and food intake were measured weekly. Male Rpb4-/- and Rpb4+/+ (wild-type control) mice were derived from mating of heterozygous (Rpb4+/-) mice licensed from Columbia University. Animals were genotyped by Southern blot as described (27Quadro L. Blaner W.S. Salchow D.J. Vogel S. Piantedosi R. Gouras P. Freeman S. Cosma M.P. Colantuoni V. Gottesman M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4633-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), and these results were confirmed by Western blot (using in-house generated rabbit polyclonal sera) and/or ELISA. For phenotypic analyses, all studies were conducted using age-matched, wild-type controls. Mice were maintained on chow (Teklad 2198) or challenged with high fat diet (BioservS1850). Statistical Analyses-Data are expressed as mean ± S.E., for the indicated number of animals per treatment group. Statistical comparisons were performed by one- or two-way repeated measures ANOVA, followed by post-tests correcting for multiple comparisons (Dunnett or Bonferroni, respectively) performed in GraphPad Prism 5.0. Identification of a Novel Non-retinoid RBP4 Ligand-Using a scintillation proximity assay (21Coward P. Conn M. Tang J. Xiong F. Menjares A. Reagan J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2009; 384: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we screened the Amgen chemical library for compounds that displaced radiolabeled retinol from human RBP4. Several leads were identified, and subsequent medicinal chemistry efforts yielded A1120 (Fig. 1A). The IC50 of A1120 was 90 nm on human RBP4 (Fig. 1B) and 66 nm on mouse RBP4 (Fig. 1C). We also tested the affinity of A1120 for cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1). CRBP1 is an intracellular retinol transport protein, but crystallographic studies have shown that the retinol binding site is not conserved between CRBP1 and RBP4 (28Cowan S.W. Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1225-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Fig. 1D shows that A1120 does not bind to CRBP1. In addition, A1120 was selective against a panel of G-protein-coupled receptor, kinase, and enzyme targets (data not shown). Thus A1120 appears to bind specifically to RBP4. We have previously described a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay that measures the interaction between RBP4 and TTR (21Coward P. Conn M. Tang J. Xiong F. Menjares A. Reagan J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2009; 384: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because retinol increases the basal interaction between RBP4 and TTR, it increases the FRET signal in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, because fenretinide disrupts the interaction between RBP4 and TTR, it decreases the FRET signal in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, because fenretinide and retinol both bind to the same site on RBP4, fenretinide will also right-shift a retinol dose-response curve. As shown in Fig. 1E, A1120 behaves qualitatively similar to fenretinide in the FRET assay; it lowers the basal response and right-shifts the retinol dose-response curve, indicating that A1120 also disrupts the interaction between RBP4 and TTR. Using the FRET assay, we determined the affinity of A1120 for RBP4 to be 8.3 nm (Fig. 1E). Thus A1120 binds to RBP4 with higher affinity than either retinol or fenretinide (Ki = 125 nm for each (21Coward P. Conn M. Tang J. Xiong F. Menjares A. Reagan J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2009; 384: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)). The X-ray Crystal Structure of A1120 Bound to RBP4-The co-crystal structure of RBP4 with A1120 was determined by molecular replacement to 2.9 Å using a previously reported RBP4 structure as a search model (PDB code: 1RBP) (7Cowan S.W.

EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1451-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 30Zanotti G. Ottonello S. Berni R. Monaco H.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It consists of a core β-barrel of eight up-and-down β strands, an N-terminal coil, and a C-terminal α-helix followed by a coil region (Fig. 2A). The co-crystal structure showed well resolved electron density for A1120 in the central cavity of the β-barrel (the same site occupied by retinol), with the trifluoromethylphenyl ring binding deep in the pocket and the benzoic acid moiety sitting at the opening (Fig. 2B). The carbonyl of the carboxamido accepts a hydrogen bond from the backbone amide of Leu-37. The carboxylic moiety of the benzoic acid forms a salt bridge with Arg-121 as well as a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-90. The rest of the molecule makes numerous van der Waals contacts with the protein. Although the β-barrel core structure of RBP4 shows very little change upon A1120 binding, conformational changes are observed in the loop regions surrounding the opening of the binding cavity, including loop β3–β4 (residues from 63 to 68) and loop β5–β6 (residues from 92 to 99) (Fig. 2C). These loop regions form part of the TTR interaction interface (10Monaco H.L. Rizzi M. Coda A. Science. 1995; 268: 1039-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 31Naylor H.M. Newcomer M.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2647-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and the conformational changes induced by A1120 disrupt the complementary surface between RBP4 and TTR that is required for high affinity binding. Fig. 2D shows how loops β3–β4 and β5–β6 in the A1120-RBP4 structure clash with TTR in the retinol·RBP4·TTR structure (10Monaco H.L. Rizzi M. Coda A. Science. 1995; 268: 1039-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 31Naylor H.M. Newcomer M.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2647-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This provides a mechanism for the disruption of RBP4·TTR binding by A1120 observed in the FRET assay (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, this mechanism is different from that seen with fenretinide, where the compound itself, in particular the phenylamide head group, sticks out directly into the region of the RBP4·TTR interface, causing a steric hindrance that prevents the RBP4·TTR complex from forming (9Zanotti G. Marcello M. Malpeli G. Folli C. Sartori G. Berni R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29613-29620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A1120 Lowers Serum RBP4 and Retinol Levels-Because in vivo administration of fenretinide results in decreased serum RBP4 and retinol levels (3Peng Y.M. Dalton W.S. Alberts D.S. Xu M.J. Lim H. Meyskens Jr., F.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Formelli F. Carsana R. Costa A. Buranelli F. Campa T. Dossena G. Magni A. Pizzichetta M. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6149-6152PubMed Google Scholar), we performed experiments to determine if A1120 would show the same effect. For all our in vivo experiments, we used B6D2F1 mice, a hybrid F1 strain between C57Bl/6 and DBA/2. These animals are well suited for studying diabetes, because they quickly develop insulin resistance on a high fat diet. Fig. 3 (A and B) shows that administration of an oral dose of 30 mg/kg A1120 to B6D2F1 mice resulted in a decrease in serum RBP4 and retinol levels, with the peak reduction in both occurring 12 h after administration. Administration of 30 mg/kg fenretinide resulted in reductions in RBP4 and retinol that followed a similar time course, although the magnitude of the effect was not as great as for A1120. Fig. 3C shows that the RBP4 lowering by A1120 is dose-dependent, with the reductions seen at 5 and 30 mg/kg similar to that seen with 30 mg/kg fenretinide (all measurements taken 4 h after compound administration). Overall, the data in Fig. 3 show that A1120 is at least as potent and efficacious as fenretinide in reducing serum levels of RBP4 and retinol. Evaluation of the Anti-diabetic Activity of A1120-Yang et al. showed that fenretinide improves insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese mice (11Yang Q. Graham T.E. Mody N. Preitner F. Peroni O.D. Zabolotny J.M. Kotani K. Quadro L. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2005; 436: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar), and so we used a similar experimental design to evaluate the anti-diabetic efficacy of A1120. B6D2F1 mice fed a high fat diet for 6 weeks were administered fenretinide, A1120, the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone, or vehicle ad libitum as a diet admixture. A chow-fed group was included as a control. After 4–6 weeks of compound administration, serum was collected for RBP4, retinol, and baseline glucose measurements, and the animals were subjected to oral glucose tolerance and insulin suppression tests. As expected, animals receiving fenretinide and A1120 showed significant RBP4 and retinol lowering (Fig. 4, A and B). Rosiglitazone treatment resulted in slightly decreased RBP4 levels, a finding consistent with published data in adipose-Glut4-/- mice (11Yang Q. Graham T.E. Mody N. Preitner F. Peroni O.D. Zabolotny J.M. Kotani K. Quadro L. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2005; 436: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). However, the effect was minor, and similar results were not seen consistently in additional studies in diet-induced and genetic rodent models of diabetes (Fig. 5F and data not shown). Chow-fed animals had slightly lower RBP4 levels than the high fat fed animals, a finding consistent with data in the literature (11Yang Q. Graham T.E. Mody N. Preitner F. Peroni O.D. Zabolotny J.M. Kotani K. Quadro L. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2005; 436:"
https://openalex.org/W1971575413,"Analyses of similarities and changes in protein conformation can provide important information regarding protein function and evolution. Many scores, including the commonly used root mean square deviation, have therefore been developed to quantify the similarities of different protein conformations. However, instead of examining individual conformations it is in many cases more relevant to analyse ensembles of conformations that have been obtained either through experiments or from methods such as molecular dynamics simulations. We here present three approaches that can be used to compare conformational ensembles in the same way as the root mean square deviation is used to compare individual pairs of structures. The methods are based on the estimation of the probability distributions underlying the ensembles and subsequent comparison of these distributions. We first validate the methods using a synthetic example from molecular dynamics simulations. We then apply the algorithms to revisit the problem of ensemble averaging during structure determination of proteins, and find that an ensemble refinement method is able to recover the correct distribution of conformations better than standard single-molecule refinement."
https://openalex.org/W2084850514,"Ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of proteins are crucial for eukaryotic physiology and development. The largest class of E3 ubiquitin ligases is made up of the cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), which themselves are positively regulated through conjugation of the ubiquitin-like peptide RUB/NEDD8 to cullins. RUB modification is antagonized by the COP9 signalosome (CSN), an evolutionarily conserved eight-subunit complex that is essential in most eukaryotes and cleaves RUB from cullins. The CSN behaves genetically as an activator of CRLs, although it abolishes CRL activity in vitro. This apparent paradox was recently reconciled in different organisms, as the CSN was shown to prevent autocatalytic degradation of several CRL substrate adaptors. We tested for such a mechanism in the model plant Arabidopsis by measuring the impact of a newly identified viable csn2 mutant on the activity and stability of SCFTIR1, a receptor to the phytohormone auxin and probably the best characterized plant CRL. Our analysis reveals that not only the F-box protein TIR1 but also relevant cullins are destabilized in csn2 and other Arabidopsis csn mutants. These results provide an explanation for the auxin resistance of csn mutants. We further observed in vivo a post-translational modification of TIR1 dependent on the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and provide evidence for proteasome-mediated degradation of TIR1, CUL1, and ASK1 (Arabidopsis SKP1 homolog). These results are consistent with CSN-dependent protection of Arabidopsis CRLs from autocatalytic degradation, as observed in other eukaryotes, and provide evidence for antagonist roles of the CSN and 26S proteasome in modulating accumulation of the plant CRL SCFTIR1.

Post-translational control of protein turnover by ubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteasome is a highly regulated process essential for all eukaryotes. In plants, it regulates many developmental and physiological responses such as hormone signaling, cell division, floral development, and maintenance of circadian rhythm (1Smalle J. Vierstra R.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 555-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 2Moon J. Parry G. Estelle M. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3181-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is a small peptide that can be covalently transferred to specific target proteins through dedicated enzymatic machinery. Polyubiquitinated substrates are then normally targeted for proteasome-dependent degradation (3Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6902) Google Scholar). E3 ubiquitin ligases confer substrate specificity to the ubiquitination machinery and are subdivided into different groups based on their mechanistic and structural characteristics (4Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). Cullin-RING (really interesting new gene) E3 ligases (CRLs) 3The abbreviations used are: CRL, cullin-RING ligase; SCF, SKP1-cullin-F-box; Aux, auxin; CSN, COP9 signalosome; GUS, β-glucuronidase; RT, reverse transcription; CHX, cycloheximide; HA, hemagglutinin; 2,4-D, 2,4-dichlorphenoxyacetic acid; IAA, indoleacetic acid. are composed of a cullin subunit, a RING protein (RBX1/Hrt1/Roc1), which recruits the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and a substrate receptor that specifically binds proteins to be ubiquitinated. Arabidopsis expresses four functionally relevant cullins giving rise to three distinct classes of CRLs. The functionally redundant cullins CUL3A and CUL3B associate with BTB/POZ (Bric-a-brac, Tramtrack, and broad complex/Pox virus and zinc finger) domain-containing substrate adaptors (5Dieterle M.

CUL4 associates with a subgroup of WD40 repeat-containing proteins called DWD proteins via the DDB1 adaptor (8Lee J. Zhou P. Mol.

Genschik P. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2006; 9: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar).

A CUL3-ETO1 complex is involved in ethylene biosynthesis (15Wang K.L. Yoshida H. Lurin C. Ecker J.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and CUL4-based complexes are important for development and photomorphogenesis (9Lee J.H. Terzaghi W. Gusmaroli G. Charron J.B.

The best characterized SCFs are the SCFTIR1/AFB complexes, which function as receptors for the plant hormone auxin (16Kepinski S. Leyser O. Nature. 2005; 435: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 17Dharmasiri N. Dharmasiri S. Estelle M. Nature. 2005; 435: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). Auxins regulate many aspects of plant growth and development (18Teale W.D. Paponov I.A. Palme K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) and have been shown to directly bind to the F-box protein TIR1 (transport inhibitor response) and the homologous AFB1–3 proteins inside the cell (16Kepinski S. Leyser O. Nature. 2005; 435: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 17Dharmasiri N. Dharmasiri S. Estelle M.

Cell. 2005; 9: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Auxin binding increases the affinity of SCFTIR1/AFB for its substrates, the Aux/IAA proteins, leading to their increased ubiquitination and turnover. As a result, auxin response factors (ARFs), in which activities are normally repressed through dimerization with Aux/IAAs, are liberated and can thus function as transcriptional regulators of auxin responsive genes (18Teale W.D. Paponov I.A. Palme K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Suppression of ARF5-dependent transcription by IAA12 was recently shown to depend on the co-repressor TPL (TOPLESS), which binds to IAA12 (20Szemenyei H. Hannon M. Long J.A. Science. 2008; 319: 1384-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), and the repressor function of other Aux/IAA proteins might also depend on other TPL-related co-factors (21Lau S. Jurgens G. De Smet I. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1738-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mutations affecting SCFTIR1/AFB activity result in the stabilization of Aux/IAA proteins, decreased induction of auxin-regulated genes, and reduced sensitivity to exogenous auxin. The latter phenotype was used extensively for genetic screens leading to the identification of SCF components and regulators. Several auxin-resistant mutants are defective in the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein RUB/NEDD8 (related to ubiquitin/neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 8) to cullins. Although the molecular role of RUB modification is not fully understood, it is essential for CRL activity and promotes E3 ligase function both in vivo and in vitro (reviewed in Ref. 22Parry G. Estelle M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The COP9 signalosome (CSN) cleaves RUB/NEDD8 from cullins (23Lyapina S. Cope G. Shevchenko A. Serino G.

Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) and is biochemically antagonist to the RUB conjugation machinery. The CSN is conserved in eukaryotes, is structurally related to the 19S lid complex of the 26S proteasome, and is composed of six PCI (proteasome, COP9, eIF3; CSN1–4 and CSN7–8) and two MPN (Mov34, Pad1 N-terminal; CSN5 and CSN6) domain-containing subunits (25Serino G. Su H. Peng Z. Tsuge T. Wei N. Gu H. Deng X.W. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although the derubylation activity of CSN resides in the JAMM domain of CSN5 (24Cope G.A. Suh G.S. Aravind L. Schwarz S.E. Zipursky S.L. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), Arabidopsis mutants deficient in any subunit share a common derubylation defect, reflected in the accumulation of RUB-modified cullins, and show the severe cop/det/fus phenotype of constitutive photomorphogenesis (cop/det) and accumulation of anthocyanins (fusca), culminating in early seedling lethality (26Serino G. Deng X.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27Gusmaroli G. Figueroa P. Serino G. Deng X.W. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 564-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This common phenotype is explained by the dissociation of the holocomplex in all csn mutants, accompanied by partial or complete destabilization of all other subunits with the exception of CSN5 (27Gusmaroli G. Figueroa P. Serino G. Deng X.W. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 564-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although loss of CSN function is tolerated in some fungi (28Mundt K.E. Liu C. Carr A.M. Mol.

A. 2007; 104: 8089-8094Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), CSN is essential for all animal and plant systems studied thus far. Because RUB conjugation promotes E3 ligase activity, RUB cleavage by the CSN is expected to act as a negative regulator of CRL activity. Although this holds true in vitro, genetic studies show that the CSN acts as a promoter of E3 ligase activity in vivo. This apparent paradox was first reconciled in fission yeast, as CSN was shown to protect CRL substrate adaptors from autocatalytic degradation through both its derubylation activity and a CSN-associated deubiquitinating enzyme (31Wee S. Geyer R.K. Toda T. Wolf D.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Similar observations were subsequently made in other systems (29He Q. Cheng P. He Q. Liu Y.

Additionally, destabilization of cullins upon reduction of CSN function has been reported in some but not all model systems (29He Q. Cheng P. He Q. Liu Y.

Thus, fundamental differences may occur as manifested by the differential impact of CSN on cullin stability in yeast and Drosophila (31Wee S. Geyer R.K. Toda T. Wolf D.A. Nat.

Secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma (alkaline phosphatase conjugates) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (horseradish peroxidase conjugates). Alkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase activity was detected with p-nitro blue tetrazolium and enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Femto chemiluminescent substrate, Pierce), respectively. To quantify immunoblot results, membranes or films derived from three independent biological samples were scanned and analyzed with ImageJ software. Background values were measured above and below the specific signal and used for corrections. Measurements were repeated at least twice, and measurement errors were <5%. Average values and standard deviations for three biological replicates were calculated. Schizosaccharomyces pombe Experiments-A Gateway cloning cassette was introduced into pREP3X expression vector giving pREP3XG (details available upon request). The genomic sequence coding for SpCSN2 was amplified by PCR from yeast strain 501 (50Murray J.M. Doe C.L. Schenk P. Carr A.M. Lehmann A.R. Watts F.Z.

The csn2-5 mutation was introduced into pE-SpCSN2 by site-directed mutagenesis, giving pE-Spcsn2-5. Sequences coding for AtCSN2, SpCSN2, and Spcsn2-5 were recombined into pREP3XG. The resulting plasmids were transformed in strain pcu1-MYC csn2-d (28Mundt K.E. Liu C. Carr A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For UV sensitivity tests, three parallel dilution series were prepared from overnight liquid cultures for each genotype. Dilutions plated on Petri dishes were given a single dose of UV-C (254 nm; 0–100 kJ/m2; without lid) using a Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Colony-forming units were determined in the appropriate dilutions after 4 days at 28 °C. Two independent experiments were performed. Total protein extracts were prepared under denaturing conditions as described (51Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1254-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Structure Prediction of CSN2-One PSI-BLAST iteration of the A. thaliana CSN2 query sequence on the NCBI nr Database was performed and only sequences with identity higher than 30% were kept (52Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59915) Google Scholar). A multiple sequence alignment was built from the 27 retrieved CSN2-like sequences using MUSCLE (53Edgar R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30500) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions were performed using PsiPred on this alignment (54Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4465) Google Scholar). HMM-HMM comparison using the HHpred server on the Protein Data Bank data base was used to search for structural templates suitable for comparative modeling (55Soding J. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2005; 21: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). From the results, a structural model of CSN2 A. thaliana could be built from several templates detected with high confidence. Residues 40–321 matched, with highest probabilities, the HEAT repeat from the Danio rerio γ-SNAP (probability = 98.9%, E-value = 2.8e-09, sequence ID = 16%) and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SEC17 (probability = 98.22%, E-value = 1.1e-05, sequence ID = 11%, Protein Data Bank codes 2ifu and 1qqe, respectively); residues 285–388 matched a region spanning the HAM (HEAT analogous motif) and the WH (winged helix) domain of the Homo sapiens eIF3k subunit (probability = 95.02%, E-value = 0.13, sequence ID = 10%, Protein Data Bank code 1rz4); residues 348 -417 matched the WH C-terminal domain of the Mus musculus CSN4 COP9 subunit (probability = 98.88%, E-value = 1.4e-11, sequence ID = 21%, Protein Data Bank code 1ufm). The four templates were combined into a single alignment together with the A. thaliana CSN2 sequence. The alignment was optimized locally by hand so"

Like other secreted proteins, TSP2 contains a series of protein binding motifs, including an NH2-terminal heparin binding domain, a collagen-like oligomerization motif (von Willebrand factor-like domain), type I–III TSP repeats, and a globular carboxyl-terminal domain (3Carlson C.B. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 672-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Each of these protein modules has unique functions that are mediated by distinct receptors that stimulate multiple cellular pathways (reviewed in Refs. 2Adams J.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

In addition, TSP2 binds to extracellular proteins such as matrix metalloproteinases and facilitates their clearance (7Yang Z. Strickland D.K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8403-8408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved, intercellular signaling system that plays an essential role in development of multiple organ systems (8Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4918) Google Scholar). The four mammalian Notch gene products all appear to signal in a similar fashion. Each Notch receptor is a large transmembrane protein with complex extra- and intracellular domains. The ectodomain is composed of a tandem array of over 34 EGF-like repeats and three cysteine-rich Lin12 repeats. Individual EGF-like repeats include six highly conserved cysteine residues, which participate in the formation of disulfide bonds and promote maintenance of protein conformation. Notch receptors are processed (called S1 processing) within the secretory pathway into a non-covalently linked heterodimer composed of the extracellular NH2-terminal domain and a membrane spanning/intracellular COOH-terminal domain (reviewed by numerous authors, including Refs. 8Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4918) Google Scholar and 9Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Canonical Notch ligands (Jagged1, Jagged2, Delta1 (DLL1), DLL3, and DLL4) (10Li J.L. Harris A.L.

Neurosci. 2005; 8: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) bind to Notch and trigger two additional proteolytic cleavages. A second cleavage (S2) is regulated by ligand binding and involves a tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme (TACE (12Brou C. Logeat F. Gupta N. Bessia C. LeBail O. Doedens J.R. Cumano A. Roux P. Black R.A. Israel A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar)). The third cleavage (S3) is mediated by a presenilin-dependent γ-secretase (13Okochi M. Steiner H. Fukumori A. Tanii H. Tomita T. Tanaka T. Iwatsubo T. Kudo T. Takeda M. Haass C.

This series of proteolytic events allows migration of the intracellular domain into the nucleus, which results in the expression of target genes, including the Hairy Enhancer of Split (HES), HES-related (HRT), and Deltex genes (8Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

Biol. 2003; 23: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). This classical pathway of Notch signaling is non-cell autonomous, requiring membrane-bound ligand expression from an adjacent cell to communicate with the Notch-expressing cell. In humans, the Notch pathway plays an important role in homeostatic function and development. Mutations in Notch3 cause the autosomal dominant genetic disease CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (16Joutel A. Ducros A. Vahedi K. Chabriat H. Mouton P. Alamowitch S. Domenga V. Cecillion M. Marechal E. Maciazek J. Vayssiere C. Cruaud C. Cabanis E.A. Ruchoux M.M. Weissenbach J. Bach J.F. Bousser M.G. Tournier-Lasserve E.

Multiorgan defects are a significant feature of Alagielle syndrome, a developmental disorder, which is caused by mutations in the Notch ligand Jagged1 (17Li L. Krantz I.D. Deng Y. Genin A. Banta A.B.

Hum. Genet. 2006; 79: 169-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Notch signaling also plays an important role in cancer. Activating mutations in Notch1 cause a subset of aggressive lymphomas whose growth are dependent on cell autonomous constitutive activation of the Notch pathway (20Weng A.P. Ferrando A.A. Lee W. Morris J.P. Silverman L.B. Sanchez-Irizarry C. Blacklow S.C. Look A.T. Aster J.C. Science. 2004; 306: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). In addition, a series of recent studies have demonstrated gene amplification and protein overexpression of Notch3 in lung (21Dang T.P. Gazdar A.F. Virmani A.K. Sepetavec T. Hande K.R. Minna J.D. Roberts J.R. Carbone D.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1355-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and ovarian (22Park J.T. Li M. Nakayama K. Mao T.L. Davidson B. Zhang Z. Kurman R.J. Eberhart C.G. Shih Ie M. Wang T.L.

Thus, Notch participates in a number of human disorders, and protein regulators of Notch activity have potential clinical relevance. Recent work has demonstrated that several matrix proteins are capable of altering Notch signaling. These include CCN/NOV3 (23Sakamoto K. Yamaguchi S. Ando R. Miyawaki A. Kabasawa Y. Takagi M. Li C.L. Perbal B. Katsube K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29399-29405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and MAGP proteins (24Miyamoto A. Lau R. Hein P.W. Shipley J.M. Weinmaster G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10089-10097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which are capable of activating Notch signaling independent of canonical ligands. Other experiments have identified TSP1, a protein closely related to TSP2, as a binding partner of a soluble splice form of Jagged1 (25Aho S. Uitto J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but a direct role for any TSP in Notch signaling has yet to be elucidated. In the following experiments, we investigated the functional interaction between TSP2 and Notch3; TSP2 was chosen for analysis because of our interest in Notch3 signal modification in vascular smooth muscle, which also synthesizes TSP2. We demonstrate that TSP2 enhances Notch3-dependent signaling. In addition to showing this functional interaction, we also demonstrate that TSP2 physically interacts with both Notch3 and Jagged1, suggesting a novel intermediary function for TSP2 in cell-cell communication. Cell Culture-293A (Qbiogene), L fibroblast lines, and A2780 were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). H460 cells were propagated in RPMI1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Co-cultures were all performed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or RPMI complete media, unless otherwise indicated. For transfections (performed in triplicate), cells were grown in 12-well or 24-well plates and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's protocol. For coculture experiments, Notch expressing cells were first transfected on plates; after an overnight incubation, DNA was removed by washing cells with media, and Notch expressing cells were overlaid with Notch ligand expressing cells for 12–24 h. Luciferase assays were performed using a dual luciferase kit. The ratio of firefly (Notch target Hes-luciferase promoter) to Renilla luciferase (encoded by phRG-TK, Promega) was calculated to obtain relative Notch activity levels. Where indicated, we added purified recombinant TSP1 or TSP2 (R&D Systems; >90% per manufacturer; protein appears as a single band on SDS-PAGE) directly to the culture medium. In some experiments, cells were immunostained with TRA1–85 (70 ng/ml), which reacts against human (but not mouse) CD147. Unless noted, each experiment was repeated at least three times. Western Blots-Cells were washed with PBS, harvested, and sonicated in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce)). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used for Western blot analysis. Notch3 was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of mouse monoclonal antibody (M-01 from Abnova) against the NH2 terminus of Notch3 or polyclonal antibodies against the COOH terminus (Santa Cruz). Myc (clone 9E10; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) and hemagglutinin monoclonal antibodies have been described and were used at 10–50 ng/ml. The TSP2 monoclonal antibody CAF-1 (BD Biosciences) was used at 50 ng/ml. IRDye-labeled secondary antibodies (Rockland, 1:10,000) were used on membranes that were analyzed with an Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). Coimmunoprecipitation-293A cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with expression constructs encoding proteins of interest for 48 h. The protocol was performed essentially as described (26Zhang Y. Jia L. Lee S.J. Wang M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and lysed in 0.3 ml/well of modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm sodium fluoride) containing protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min and supernatants were then mixed with 1 μg of antibody. After 4 h at 4 °C, 40 μl of packed protein G-agarose (Upstate) was added and mixed for 4 h. Immunoprecipitates were then washed five times with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and finally resuspended in 30 μl of 2× protein sample buffer. Proteins were eluted by boiling the beads for 5 min prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Animals-Congenic TSP2 knock-out (27Kyriakides T.R. Zhu Y.H. Smith L.T. Bain S.D. Yang Z. Lin M.T. Danielson K.G. Iozzo R.V. LaMarca M. McKinney C.E. Ginns E.I. Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and wild type control mice on a C57Bl6/129/SvJ background were maintained under AALAC approved conditions. All animal usage was approved by an institutional animal research review board and performed in accordance with standard animal use methodology. For carotid artery studies, animals were anesthetized with xylazine and ketamine prior to tissue procurement. Gene Expression Analysis-RNA was prepared using the RNEasy kit (Qiagen) and subjected to quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR using a Stratagene thermal cycler. Equivalent amounts of RNA were used for control reactions (for 18 S rRNA) to ensure equal RNA content. Primers for quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR were designed using Primerbank online software. The sequences were: mouse Hes1 forward, 5′-CCA GCC AGT GTC AAC ACG A-3′; mouse Hes1 reverse, 5′-AAT GCC GGG AGC TAT CTT TCT-3′; mouse Hes5 forward, 5′-AGT CCC AAG GAG AAA AAC CGA-3′; mouse Hes5 reverse, 5′-GCT GTG TTT CAG GTA GCT GAC-3′; mouse Hey1 forward, 5′-CTG GCT ATG GAC TAT CGG AGT-3′; and mouse Hey1 reverse, 5′-GAC CAG GCG AAC GAG AAG C-3′. Binding Assays-The following purified recombinant proteins were obtained from R&D Systems: recombinant human Notch-3-Fc fusion (first 11 EGF repeats), rat Jagged1-Fc, human full-length TSP1 and TSP2, and control human IgG1 Fc. Proteins (5 μg) were labeled with Alexa700-succinimide (10 μg) in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. Excess label was removed by gel filtration through a size exclusion column equilibrated in Tris buffer (Bio-Rad; 25-kDa cutoff). Labeled proteins were visualized by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions; the gel was imaged without further processing using a LiCor Odyssey flatbed infrared detector; all proteins were predominantly one band of the expected molecular weight, which was consistent with the manufacturer's reported purity (>90%). Target proteins were coated on 96-well flat bottom Nunc ELISA plates at 5 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl) with 2 mm CaCl2 overnight at 4 °C and blocked with 1% BSA in Tris-buffered saline with 2 mm CaCl2 for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were then incubated with increasing concentrations of Alexa700-succinimide labeled proteins in Tris-buffered saline plus 2 mm CaCl2 and 0.05% Tween 20 at 4 °C overnight. Bound proteins were detected using a LiCor Odyssey flatbed infrared detector and quantified by measuring the density of Alexa700 label adhering to the plates. In some experiments, additional unlabeled proteins were added to wells to test for potential competition or enhancement of binding. Alexa-labeled ligands have been used before in binding studies of proteins adsorbed to plastic (28Albizu L. Teppaz G. Seyer R. Bazin H. Ansanay H. Manning M. Mouillac B. Durroux T. J. Med. Chem. 2007; 50: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To validate the specificity and accuracy of this assay, we performed several controls. We showed that only trivial amounts of Notch3 (on the plate or in solution) are bound by Fc and BSA control proteins. We demonstrate that only trace amounts of TSP2 (on the plate or in solution) bind to Fc and BSA control proteins. In addition, we show that labeled proteins in the ranges detected in this assay can be detected within the linear range of the LiCor Odyssey flatbed infrared detector (supplemental data Fig. S1). Expected saturable binding was demonstrated between Jagged1 and Notch3 (Fig. 7E). Statistical Analysis-We used standard t tests for analysis of groups. Three independently repeated experiments with p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. TSP2 Modulates Notch3 Signaling-We investigated Notch3 signaling in the H460 lung cancer cell line, which selectively expresses Notch3 but not Notch1, -2, and -4 (29Konishi J. Kawaguchi K.S. Vo H. Haruki N. Gonzalez A. Carbone D.P. Dang T.P. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8051-8057Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To quantify the level of Notch3 activation, H460 cells were transfected with Hes1-luciferase (30Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). The Notch3 pathway was stimulated by coculturing reporter-transfected H460 cells with well established stable fibroblast cell lines expressing empty vector, Jagged1, or Delta1 cDNA (31Hicks C. Johnston S.H. diSibio G. Collazo A. Vogt T.F. Weinmaster G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). As expected, coculture with ligand-expressing cells significantly increased Hes1-luciferase activity in H460 cells (Fig. 1A, black bars). TSP2 cDNA cotransfection further increased Notch3 activity in the presence of Jagged1 and Delta1 (Fig. 1A, white bars). To verify that TSP2 stimulates Notch3 signaling through classical γ-secretase-activated intracellular processing, we applied (N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester) to cocultures; this γ-secretase inhibitor reduced all Hes1-luciferase activity to baseline, including ligand-stimulated function, regardless of whether TSP2 was expressed. Processed Notch3 levels were not increased in the presence of transfected TSP2 (Fig. 1B); thus, the enhancement of Notch3 activation by TSP2 does not involve up-regulation of receptor levels (transfection efficiencies for H460 cells ranged from 40 to 60%). Ligand-stimulated Hes1-luciferase reporter activity was also significantly amplified with recombinant TSP2 protein, demonstrating that the stimulatory effect of TSP2 does not require co-expression within the Notch3 producing cell. The minimal tested dose required for significant stimulation of Notch3 was 50 ng/ml of TSP2. The maximal response to TSP2 was seen at 100 ng/ml (Fig. 1C). TSP2 can activate multiple intracellular signaling pathways that are independent of Notch. It is, in theory, possible that TSP2 could potentiate the transcriptional activity of the intracellular fragment of Notch3 through an intracellular pathway rather than through extracellular interactions. However, TSP2 cotransfection was unable to potentiate the action of the isolated Notch3 intracellular fragment (32Dang L. Fan X. Chaudhry A. Wang M. Gaiano N. Eberhart C.G. Oncogene. 2005; 25: 487-491Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). Thus, the enhancement of Notch3 activity by TSP2 requires the presence of the Notch3 extracellular domain. To test whether TSP2 activates Notch signaling in additional cell lines, we examined A2780 ovarian cancer cells that express Notch3 (22Park J.T. Li M. Nakayama K. Mao T.L. Davidson B. Zhang Z. Kurman R.J. Eberhart C.G. Shih Ie M. Wang T.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6312-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). TSP2 enhanced A2780 Notch3 function in coculture assays (Fig. 2). TSP2 cotransfected with Hes1-luciferase increased Jagged1 and Delta1 stimulated activity (Fig. 2A). Recombinant TSP2, added to cocultures of A2780 and ligand expressing cells, also potentiated ligand-dependent Notch3 responses (Fig. 2B). Thus, TSP2 regulates Notch3 activity in two independent Notch3-expressing cell lines. TSP1 Does Not Enhance Notch3 Signaling-TSP1 is closely related to TSP2. We therefore tested whether TSP1 could also enhance Notch3 signaling using the coculture assay described above. Because TSP1 is found in significant quantities in serum, we performed coculture experiments in serum-free media and supplemented recombinant TSP1 or TSP2 into the media. In contrast to TSP2, TSP1 failed to augment Notch3 signaling in H460 cells (Fig. 3A). Similar findings were observed when we used A2870 cells (Fig. 3B) cocultured in serum-free conditions. We also cotransfected TSP1 or TSP2 cDNA with the Hes1-luciferase construct to determine whether TSP1 coexpressed with Notch3 could potentiate Notch3 signaling (Fig. 3, C and D). Unlike TSP2, TSP1 failed to enhance Notch signaling, confirming that the Notch-enhancing ability is specific for TSP2 under serum-free conditions. Collectively, we conclude from these experiments that TSP1 does not have Notch3 enhancing properties and that TSP2 activation of Notch3 does not require coactivating serum factors. Notch3 Target Gene Expression in TSP2 Knock-out Animals- Notch3 is selectively expressed in arterial smooth muscle cells (33Joutel A. Andreux F. Gaulis S. Domenga V. Cecillon M. Battail N. Piga N. Chapon F. Godfrain C. Tournier-Lasserve E. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 34Villa N. Walker L. Lindsell C.E. Gasson J. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Weinmaster G. Mech. Dev. 2001; 108: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and inactivation of the murine Notch3 gene results in decreased expression of the Notch target genes Hes1 and Hes5 (35Monet M. Domenga V. Lemaire B. Souilhol C. Langa F. Babinet C. Gridley T. Tournier-Lasserve E. Cohen-Tannoudji M. Joutel A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 982-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, Notch3 is a major transcriptional regulator for the canonical Notch targets in arterial tissues in vivo. The levels of Hes1, Hes5, and Hey1 gene expression were significantly reduced in TSP2 knockouts, indicating that TSP2 plays a role in Notch3-stimulated gene expression in vivo (Fig. 4). TSP2 Potentiates Notch3 Inhibition of Cell Proliferation-Lung (29Konishi J. Kawaguchi K.S. Vo H. Haruki N. Gonzalez A. Carbone D.P. Dang T.P. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8051-8057Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), ovarian (22Park J.T. Li M. Nakayama K. Mao T.L. Davidson B. Zhang Z. Kurman R.J. Eberhart C.G. Shih Ie M. Wang T.L.

Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) cancer cell lines exhibit cell autonomous Notch3-dependent cell growth, but the influence of Notch ligands on cancer cells has not been characterized. We investigated in a coculture system whether non-cell autonomous Notch3 activation could modulate cell growth, and whether TSP2 could further amplify ligand-dependent Notch3 signaling effects (Fig. 5). H460 cells were cocultured with control, Jagged1, or Delta1 expressing fibroblasts to stimulate Notch signaling. We stained cocultured cells with the pan-human specific antibody TRA1–85, which specifically labels Notch3 expressing cancer cells but not ligand expressing mouse cells. Quantitation of TRA1–85 positive cells demonstrated decreases in cancer cell number with Jagged1 or Delta1 cocultures. Although we were somewhat surprised by the inhibition of proliferation by noncell autonomous Notch signaling, recent studies have demonstrated both pro- and anti-proliferative effects of Notch (37Campos A.H. Wang W. Pollman M.J. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 38Sriuranpong V. Borges M.W. Ravi R.K. Arnold D.R. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Ball D.W.

Chem. 2006; 281: 39819-39830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Transfection of H460 cells with TSP2 cDNA further reduced cell growth in the Jagged1 cocultures, but did not affect cancer cells cocultured with control cells that did not express ligands. These experiments demonstrate that ligand-stimulated Notch3 suppression of cancer cell proliferation is amplified by TSP2. TSP2 and Notch3 Directly Interact-We examined whether TSP2 forms complexes with Notch3 in cells (Fig. 6). Notch3 and TSP2 cDNAs were transfected into 293 cells and protein complexes were immunoprecipitated using Notch3 antibodies to pull down Notch3 full-length protein (Fig. 6A). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting to test for association of cognate proteins. Our results demonstrate that TSP2 binds to Notch3 in cells. Similar results were obtained using isolated hemagglutinin-tagged Notch3 ectodomain and TSP2 (not shown) showing that TSP2 interacts with Notch3 via Notch3 EGF-like repeats. Thrombomodulin and fibulin, which also contain EGF-like repeats, did not interact with Notch3 in co-immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting that the Notch3-TSP2 interaction was specific (not shown). To test whether the binding of TSP2 to Notch3 occurred on cells, we applied recombinant TSP2 to the culture media of H460 cells and then immunoprecipitated Notch3. TSP2 coprecipitated with Notch3 (Fig. 6B) but did not associate with immunoprecipitates generated with control antibodies. This experiment suggests that TSP2 binds directly to Notch at the surface of cells. To confirm that Notch3 and TSP2 were capable of binding directly, purified, recombinant TSP2 was immobilized on plastic plates. Notch3 ectodomain (expressed as an Fc fusion to the first 11 EGF-like repeats of Notch3 and labeled with Alexa700-succinimide) was applied to TSP2-coated plates. Significant amounts of Notch3 bound to TSP2-coated plates (Fig. 6C) with an EC50 of 2 μg/ml. Only trace amounts of Fc protein bound to TSP2-coated plates (and were subtracted from the Notch3 valued to generate data displayed in Fig. 6C). Taken together, the coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro binding studies demonstrate that TSP2 and Notch3 bind specifically and directly. In addition, we tested whether purified Notch3 and TSP1 bind in vitro. Using plate binding assays, we showed that Notch3 binds to TSP1-coated plates (Fig. 6D). Thus, although only TSP2 activated Notch3 signaling, TSP1 and TSP2 both bind to Notch3 in vitro. Interaction between TSP2 and Jagged1-TSP2 does not activate Notch3 by itself; rather, it potentiates signaling in the presence of ligands. It is possible that TSP2 could simultaneously bind Notch and ligand to facilitate binding. Therefore, we investigated whether TSP2 could also bind to Jagged1, which structurally resembles Notch proteins and has been shown previously to interact with TSP1 (25Aho S. Uitto J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). TSP2 and Jagged1 were coexpressed and pulled down with monoclonal antibodies. As in previous experiments, binding was determined by detection of the reciprocal protein by Western blotting. The interaction was dependent on coexpression of the two proteins (Fig. 7A). To determine whether Jagged1 could bind to TSP2 added to the cell culture media, we incubated recombinant TSP2 with Jagged1 expressing fibroblasts. We detected TSP2 protein with immunoprecipitated Jagged1 (Fig. 7B), indicating that the TSP2/Jagged1 interaction could take place on the cell surface. In addition, we confirmed that TSP2 binds Jagged1 directly in an in vitro binding assay (Fig. 7C). Previous studies demonstrated that Jagged1 interacts with TSP1 in yeast (25Aho S. Uitto J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We performed additional studies that demonstrate that Jagged1 binds to TSP1 in direct binding assays (Fig. 7D). To test whether TSP2 could affect binding between Jagged1 and Notch3, we applied unlabeled TSP2 to in vitro binding reactions. Total Jagged1 binding to the Notch3 ectodomain was significantly enhanced by the addition of unlabeled recombinant TSP2 (Fig. 7E). TSP2 did not change the binding affinity between Notch3 and Jagged1 (calculated EC50 was 2 ng/ml for both). Significantly, although TSP1 bound Notch3 and Jagged in vitro, TSP1 did not alter the affinity of the amount of binding between Notch3 and Jagged1. The specific ability of TSP2 to enhance binding of the ligand and its receptor is consistent with its role in stimulating the overall levels of Notch signaling that was demonstrated in Fig. 1.

https://openalex.org/W1998248874,Halothermothirx orenii is a strictly anaerobic thermohalophilic bacterium isolated from sediment of a Tunisian salt lake. It belongs to the order Halanaerobiales in the phylum Firmicutes. The complete sequence revealed that the genome consists of one circular chromosome of 2578146 bps encoding 2451 predicted genes. This is the first genome sequence of an organism belonging to the Haloanaerobiales. Features of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria were identified with the presence of both a sporulating mechanism typical of Firmicutes and a characteristic Gram negative lipopolysaccharide being the most prominent. Protein sequence analyses and metabolic reconstruction reveal a unique combination of strategies for thermophilic and halophilic adaptation. H. orenii can serve as a model organism for the study of the evolution of the Gram negative phenotype as well as the adaptation under thermohalophilic conditions and the development of biotechnological applications under conditions that require high temperatures and high salt concentrations.
https://openalex.org/W2137701173,"Structural modification of peptidoglycan (PG) is one of the mechanisms that pathogenic bacteria use to evade the host innate immune system. For the noninvasive human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, PG delivery to the host cells is one trigger of the immune response. H. pylori HP310 was markedly up-expressed upon cell exposure to oxidative stress. However, disruption of HP310 did not produce a phenotype distinguishable from the parent, including oxidative stress resistance characteristics. HP310 shows very weak homology to a known gene pgdA encoding PG deacetylase in Streptococcous pneumoniae. PGs from wild type H. pylori and the HP310 mutant were purified and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight and high pressure liquid chromatography. The parent strain PG is partially deacetylated, whereas several major PG-deacetylated muropeptides are absent or significantly reduced in the HP310 mutant. PG deacetylase activity was directly demonstrated by use of pure PG and HP310 protein by measuring the release of acetic acid. The Gram-negative bacterium H. pylori is highly resistant to lysozyme (up to 50 mg/ml), but the HP310 mutant is less resistant to lysozyme compared with the parent strain. Complementation of an hp310 strain with the wild type gene restored lysozyme resistance. The purified PG from the mutant is more susceptible to lysozyme (0.3 mg/ml) digestion than the wild type PG. The PG deacetylation appears to confer lysozyme resistance to escape immune detection. HP310 is representative of a new subfamily of bacterial PG deacetylases."
https://openalex.org/W2095664544,"Previous studies from our laboratory using co-immunoprecipitation techniques suggested that the human lutropin receptor (hLHR) constitutively self-associates into dimers/oligomers and that agonist treatment of cells either increased hLHR dimerization/oligomerization and/or stabilized hLHR dimers/oligomers to detergent solubilization (Tao, Y. X., Johnson, N. B., and Segaloff, D. L. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 5904–5914). In this study, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET2) analyses confirmed that the hLHR constitutively self-associates in living cells. After subcellular fractionation, hLHR dimers/oligomers were detected in both the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Further evidence supporting the constitutive formation of hLHR dimer/oligomers in the ER is provided by data showing homodimerization of misfolded hLHR mutants that are retained in the ER. These mutants, when co-expressed with wild-type receptor, are shown by BRET2 to heterodimerize, accounting for their dominant-negative effects on cell surface receptor expression. Hormone desorption assays using intact cells demonstrate allosterism between hLHR protomers, indicating functional cell surface hLHR dimers. However, quantitative BRET2 analyses in intact cells indicate a lack of effect of agonist on the propensity of the hLHR to dimerize. Using purified plasma membranes, human chorionic gonadotropin was similarly observed to have no effect on the BRET2 signal. An examination of the propensity for constitutively active and signaling inactive hLHR mutants to dimerize further showed no correlation between dimerization and the activation state of the hLHR. Taken altogether, our data suggest that hLHR dimers/oligomers are formed early in the biosynthetic pathway in the ER, are constitutively expressed on the plasma membrane, and are not affected by the activation state of the hLHR. Previous studies from our laboratory using co-immunoprecipitation techniques suggested that the human lutropin receptor (hLHR) constitutively self-associates into dimers/oligomers and that agonist treatment of cells either increased hLHR dimerization/oligomerization and/or stabilized hLHR dimers/oligomers to detergent solubilization (Tao, Y.

The human lutropin receptor (hLHR) 3The abbreviations used are: hLHR, human lutropin receptor; LHR, lutropin receptor; LH, lutropin; hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; D-PBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; GPCR, protein-coupled receptor; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CAM, constitutively active mutant; FRET, fluorescent resonance energy transfer; RET, resonance energy transfer. is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a central role in reproductive physiology. In women, the LHR is expressed primarily in the ovary, where it mediates the actions of pituitary LH by stimulating the synthesis of androgens (which are mostly converted to estrogens) and ovulation. The hLHR also binds the nearly identical placental glycoprotein hormone hCG. As such, in pregnant women it rescues the corpus luteum, thus maintaining pregnancy. In males the hLHR is expressed predominantly in the testes, stimulating androgen biosynthesis in response to LH. The physiological importance of the LHR to reproductive physiology is underscored by disorders arising from mutations of the hLHR gene (1Latronico A. Segaloff D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 949-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 2Themmen A.P.N. Huhtaniemi I.T. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 551-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, whereas constitutively active mutants (CAMs) of the hLHR are associated with gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty in males, loss-of-function mutations of the hLHR result in Leydig cell hypoplasia in males and infertility in females. Structurally, the hLHR is composed of two structural domains. There is the canonical seven transmembrane serpentine region common to GPCRs as well as a large extracellular domain that is composed of numerous leucine-rich repeats, which bind LH or hCG with high affinity (3Ascoli M. Fanelli F. Segaloff D.L. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The hLHR is most closely related to the other glycoprotein hormone receptors for follitropin and thyrotropin, and is a member of the family A or rhodopsin-like family of GPCRs (4Vassart G. Pardo L. Costagliola S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 119-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Agonist-occupied wild-type hLHR or hLHR CAMs activate the Gs, Gi/o, and Gq/11 families of G proteins (5Hirakawa T. Ascoli M.

Endocrinol. 2007; 260–262: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), with the primary actions of the hLHR being mediated by Gs. A large body of work published in recent years supports the concept that GPCRs can form self-associated dimers and higher ordered oligomers within cells (for reviews see Refs. 7Bulenger S. Marullo S. Bouvier M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 131-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 8Milligan G. Biochim. Biophys.

In addition to GPCRs forming homodimers, distinct GPCRs can in some cases physically associate as heterodimers. The functional ramifications of GPCR dimerization are most clearly evident in heterodimers, where in many cases the pharmacological properties of heterodimers between two different GPCRs are unique as compared with those of each GPCR alone (11Mellado M.

It has been hypothesized that agonist binding may alter the dimerization state of the receptor. Although this question has been addressed in numerous studies, there is little consensus with some studies suggesting that agonist promotes GPCR dimer formation (20Rodriguez-Frade J.M.

As discussed in a recent review, unappreciated limitations to some of the methods used may have contributed to the apparently discrepant results (10Hebert T.E. Gales C. Rebois R.V. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 45: 85-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that the LHR can self-associate into dimers/oligomers. Evidence pointing toward this goes back to as early as the 1980s when data from equilibrium sedimentation of detergent-solubilized LHR and radiation inactivation of LHRs on gonadal cells suggested that the LHR may be present in a dimeric or oligomeric form (31Kusuda S. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3046-3049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Crine P. Aubry M. Potier M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1984; 438: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). More recently, functional complementation studies further suggested the dimerization of the LHR (33Lee C.-W. Ji I. Ryu K.-S.

Direct evidence in support of dimerization of the LHR has been obtained using fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) (35Roess D.A. Horvat R.D. Munnelly H. Barisas B.G.

Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 260: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) as well as our studies demonstrating specific co-immunoprecipitation of differentially tagged forms of the LHR (39Tao Y.X. Johnson N.B. Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5904-5914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this latter study it was shown that under basal conditions the hLHR physically self-associates into complexes of sizes consistent with dimers and higher ordered oligomers of the receptor. It was also observed that hCG pretreatment of cells prior to detergent solubilization led to an increase in the abundance of hLHR dimers/oligomers relative to monomers as detected by Western blotting. Although these results could be explained by an agonist-dependent induction of hLHR dimerization, it may also reflect a stabilization of preformed receptor dimers/oligomers to detergent solubilization when they are occupied by hCG. To address this question, this work was undertaken utilizing bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) as an independent means to probe hLHR dimerization and to study the effects of receptor activation on dimerization. BRET is a highly sensitive means to assess protein-protein interactions in living cells, thus avoiding the detergent solubilization required for co-immunoprecipitation experiments (10Hebert T.E. Gales C. Rebois R.V. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 45: 85-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Milligan G. Bouvier M. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2914-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 41Pfleger K.D. Eidne K.A. Nat. Meth. 2006; 3: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In the BRET paradigm, a given protein is fused to the energy donor Renilla luciferase (Rluc), which is co-expressed with the same or a different protein fused to an energy acceptor, typically a variant of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Addition of substrate for Rluc results in bioluminescence, which can also cause the excitation of GFP via resonance energy transfer only if the donor and acceptor are within 100 Å of each other, a distance consistent with the predicted size of a GPCR dimer (10Hebert T.E. Gales C. Rebois R.V. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 45: 85-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Milligan G. Bouvier M. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2914-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 41Pfleger K.D. Eidne K.A. Nat. Meth. 2006; 3: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Although identical in principle, BRET2 is a second generation modification of BRET that achieves a greater spectral resolution between donor and acceptor emissions (10Hebert T.E. Gales C. Rebois R.V. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 45: 85-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Milligan G. Bouvier M. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2914-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 41Pfleger K.D. Eidne K.A. Nat. Meth. 2006; 3: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Both have been widely used in recent years to examine homo- and heterodimerization of a number of different GPCRs (10Hebert T.E. Gales C. Rebois R.V. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 45: 85-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A limitation of BRET/BRET2 (as well as the related method of FRET) is that a positive signal from a single ratio of energy donor and acceptor is not necessarily reflective of the affinity of GPCR protomers to dimerize nor the extent of GPCR dimerization. This is because RET is dependent not only on the distance between the energy donor and acceptor, but on their relative orientations as well (10Hebert T.E. Gales C. Rebois R.V. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 45: 85-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Milligan G. Bouvier M. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2914-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 41Pfleger K.D. Eidne K.A. Nat. Meth. 2006; 3: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). A method of quantitative BRET analyses was therefore proposed by Mercier et al. (42Mercier J.-F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) to permit the determination of the relative affinities of pairs of GPCR protomers to form homo- or heterodimers. Based on theoretical considerations of RET, this approach utilizes saturation curves (analogous to hormone-receptor binding curves) to calculate the half-maximal BRET signal (BRET50), which is related to the relative affinity of the protomers for each other (41Pfleger K.D. Eidne K.A. Nat. Meth. 2006; 3: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 42Mercier J.-F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Using quantitative BRET2 analyses, we demonstrate that hLHR dimers can be detected under basal conditions in living cells, with constitutively expressed hLHR dimers/oligomers observed in both the plasma membrane as well as the endoplasmic reticulum. From a number of different experimental strategies, it is further concluded that dimerization/oligomerization of the hLHR is not affected by the activation state of the hLHR. Plasmids and Hormones-The hLHR cDNA was kindly given to us by Ares Advanced Technology (Ares-Serono Group, Randolph, MA). Mutants of the hLHR were made using standard techniques. The wild-type and mutant forms of the hLHR were all modified to contain a Myc epitope tag at the N terminus. Before use, the coding sequence of each construct was determined by the DNA Core of the University of Iowa. For the BRET2 studies, the cDNAs were subcloned into pRluc or pGFP2 vectors (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), which insert Renilla luciferase (Rluc) or GFP2, respectively, in-frame at the C terminus of the protein. The cDNA encoding KvLQT1 was used as described previously (43Rebois R.V. Robitaille M. Gales C. Dupre D.J. Baragli A. Trieu P. Ethier N. Bouvier M. Hebert T.E. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2807-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Highly purified preparations of recombinant hCG and recombinant hLH were purchased from Dr. A. Parlow and the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health. hLH was iodinated as described previously for hCG (44Ascoli M. Puett D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A crude preparation of hCG (used solely for the determination of nonspecific binding of 125I-hLH) was purchased from Sigma. Cells and Transfections-Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 and 293T cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained at 5% CO2 in growth media consisting of high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 10 mm HEPES, and 10% newborn calf serum. For experiments, cells were plated onto wells that had been precoated for 45 min with 0.1% gelatin in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.1 (D-PBS), that was calcium- and magnesium-free. Cells were transiently transfected as described previously (45Zhang M. Mizrachi D. Fanelli F. Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26169-26176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and used for experiments 24 h after removing the mixture. BRET2 Assay-HEK293T cells in 6-well plates were transiently co-transfected with vectors encoding Rluc fusion or GFP2 fusion proteins. In a given experiment, the total amount of plasmid transfected was made constant by the addition of empty vector. On the day of the experiment, cells were washed two times with calcium- and magnesium-free D-PBS and then detached from the well in 1 ml of D-PBS. Protein concentrations were measured, and then equal protein aliquots were distributed into microcentrifuge tubes and collected by gentle centrifugation. The cell pellets were resuspended in a small volume of D-PBS and transferred to a white-bottomed 96-well microplate (white Optiplate; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) such that all samples were of equal volume and protein concentration. Total fluorescence of the cell suspensions was measured using a POLARstar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany), with an excitation filter at 485 nm and an emission filter at 520 nm, and was corrected for the fluorescence measured in cells transfected with empty vector only. The substrate Coelenterazine 400a (Biosynth; Zurich, Switzerland) was then added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and readings at 410/80 nm (reflecting the bioluminescence given off by Rluc) and 515/30 nm (reflecting the resonance energy transfer from Rluc to GFP2) were measured simultaneously. Bioluminescence readings were corrected for those obtained from cells transfected with empty vector only. The BRET2 ratio was calculated as the ratio of the light emitted by the receptor-GFP2 (515/30 nm) over the light emitted by the receptor-Rluc (410/80 nm). The BRET2 ratios reported were corrected by subtracting the ratios obtained when receptor-Rluc was expressed alone. Within a given experiment, each data point was obtained using duplicate wells of cells that were transfected and collected for BRET2 analyses. Data shown are the mean ± range of the duplicate determinations from one representative experiment (of at least three independent experiments). BRET2 Titration Curves-For saturation curves, HEK293T cells in 6-well plates were co-transfected with a fixed concentration of Rluc fusion protein and increasing concentrations of a GFP2 fusion protein. When more than one curve was performed in a given experiment, the concentrations of plasmids encoding the Rluc fusion proteins were adjusted so that, after substrate addition, the bioluminescence values of the Rluc fusion proteins expressed alone were similar. Data were expressed as the net BRET2 ratio, calculated as described above, relative to the ratio of acceptor to donor. The data were plotted using GraphPad Prism (San Diego), and the Bmax and KD determinations were taken as the BRETmax and BRET50, respectively. Subcellular Fractionation-HEK293T cells were co-transfected with hLHR-Rluc and hLHR-GFP2 or with KvLQT1-Rluc and hLHR-GFP2 as a negative control. On the day of the experiment, the cells were placed on ice, washed three times with ice-cold D-PBS, and scraped off the dish in ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 6 mm magnesium chloride) containing complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were homogenized with 50 strokes in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer on ice. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the post-nuclear supernatant was collected and assayed for protein concentration. Each cell lysate was adjusted to 1 mg of protein in 463 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer and brought to contain a final sucrose concentration of 2 m and placed in the bottom of a 5-ml ultracentrifuge tube for a Beckman SW55 Ti rotor. A discontinuous step sucrose gradient was then made in each tube as follows. Applied above the sample, 237 μl of lysis buffer containing 1.9 m sucrose was added. Then 700 μl each of hypotonic lysis buffer containing 1.75, 1.5, 1.25, 1.0, 0.75, and 0.5 m sucrose were added. Samples were centrifuged 16 h at 50,000 rpm at 4 °C. Aliquots of 400 μl were taken from the top of each tube. BRET2 ratios were determined from 100-μl samples. Equal volume samples were also taken from each aliquot for Western blots (see below) to detect calnexin (a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum), Na+/K+-ATPase (a marker for the plasma membrane), or the myc-hLHR. Protein concentrations were measured in each aliquot. Western blots for myc-hLHR were also analyzed when the gels were run after applying equal amounts of protein to each well. Western Blotting-Samples were diluted 1:6 into a 6-fold concentrated Laemmli sample buffer containing reducing agents (12% w/v SDS, 40% glycerol, 109 mm EDTA, 1.5 m Tris/HCl, 98 mg/ml dithiothreitol and 6% v/v β-mercaptoethanol), incubated 1 h at room temperature, fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody (1:1000; StressGen, Ann Arbor, MI), or anti-Na+/K+-ATPase monoclonal antibody (1:250; Sigma). The membranes were then incubated with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (1:25,000; GE Healthcare) or donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:100,000; GE Healthcare). The immunoreactive bands were visualized using the Amersham Biosciences ECL detection system (GE Healthcare). Hormone Desorption Experiments-HEK293 cells were seeded on 24-well culture plates that had been coated with gelatin as described above. Cells were transfected as described above and used for experiments 24 h after removing the mixture. On the day of the experiment, the cells were washed two times with binding medium consisting of warm Waymouth's MB752/1 containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The cells were then incubated 1 h at room temperature in binding medium containing a saturating concentration of 125I-hLH (final concentration 1000 ng/ml) with or without an excess of unlabeled crude hCG (final concentration 50 IU/ml) to determine nonspecific binding. The end of the binding assay was defined as t = 0 relative to the subsequent desorption phase of the experiment. One group of cells was used to determine the maximal binding at t = 0. These cells were set on ice, washed three times with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution modified to contain 50 μg/ml gentamicin and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, solubilized in 0.5 n NaOH, transferred to plastic test tubes with cotton swabs, and counted in a gamma counter. Another group of cells was used to determine the time course of desorption of the prebound 125I-hLH. These cells were washed three times with warm binding medium, incubated in binding medium containing hCG (final concentration 500 ng/ml), hLH (1000 ng/ml), or vehicle only and incubated for increasing times at room temperature. At a given time point, the cells were placed on ice, and the 125I-hLH released into the medium was determined by collecting the medium and precipitating intact hormone with trichloroacetic acid. To determine the amount of 125I-hLH remaining bound to the cells, the cells were washed and solubilized, and the bound radioactivity was counted as described for the t = 0 time point. To determine whether hLHR self-association could be detected in living cells, we examined whether specific BRET2 signals would be observed in cells co-transfected hLHR(wt)-Rluc and hLHR(wt)-GFP2. As shown in Fig. 1, titration curves were performed in which cells were transfected with a subsaturating and fixed concentration of the energy donor hLHR(wt)-Rluc and increasing concentrations of the energy acceptor hLHR(wt)-GFP2. As the ratio of energy acceptor to donor was increased, the BRET2 ratio increased, as would be predicted by molecules that were clustered together and not randomly distributed (42Mercier J.-F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 46Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). At the higher ratios of hLHR(wt)-Rluc to hLHR(wt)-GFP2, the BRET2 signal reached a plateau, indicative of a saturable interaction between the energy donor and acceptor (42Mercier J.-F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). As a negative control, cells were co-transfected with the plasma membrane cardiac voltage-gated K+ channel KvLQT1 fused to Rluc and hLHR(wt)-GFP2. Little or no detectable BRET2 ratios were detected under those conditions, suggesting that the BRET2 signals observed between hLHR(wt)-Rluc and hLHR(wt)-GFP2 are because of the physical interaction between the hLHR portions of the fusion proteins. To ensure that the BRET2 observed between hLHR(wt)-Rluc and hLHR(wt)-GFP2 was not because of spurious bystander interactions between the two molecules, we examined the effect of decreasing the protein expression levels of the receptor, while maintaining the ratio of hLHR(wt)-Rluc/hLHR(wt)-GFP2 constant. As shown in Fig. 2, the BRET2 ratio remained detectable at low levels of receptor expression, consistent with what would be predicted by specific clustering of molecules and not random collisions (46Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2BRET2 signal resulting from co-expression of hLHR(wt)-Rluc and hLHR(wt)-GFP2 is not a function of random self-association.

https://openalex.org/W1970509697,"The goal of this investigation was to study the expression and regulation of beta1,3-Glucuronosyltransferase-I (GlcAT-I), a key enzyme regulating GAG synthesis in cells of the intervertebral disc. There was a robust expression of GlcAT-I in the nucleus pulposus in vivo. Treatment with the calcium ionophore ionomycin resulted in increased GlcAT-I expression, whereas GlcAT-I promoter constructs lacking TonE site or a mutant TonE were unresponsive to the ionophore. Experiments using TonEBP and DN-TonEBP constructs showed that TonEBP positively regulated GlcAT-I promoter activity. ChIP analysis confirmed binding of TonEBP to the promoter. We further validated the role of TonEBP in controlling GlcAT-I expression using mouse embryo fibroblasts from TonEBP null mice. GlcAT-I promoter activity in null cells was significantly lower than the wild type cells. In contrast to wild type cells, treatment with ionomycin failed to increase GlcAT-I promoter activity in null cells. We then investigated if calcineurin (Cn)-NFAT signaling played a regulatory role in GlcAT-I expression. Inhibition of Cn following ionomycin treatment did not block GlcAT-I and tauT, a TonEBP-responsive reporter activity. GlcAT-I promoter activity was suppressed by co-expression of Cn, NFAT2, NFAT3, and NFAT4. Moreover, following ionomycin treatment, fibroblasts from CnAalpha and CnAbeta null mice exhibited robust induction in GlcAT-I promoter activity compared with wild type cells. Results of these studies demonstrate that calcium regulates GlcAT-I expression in cells of the nucleus pulposus through a signaling network comprising both activator and suppressor molecules. The results suggest that by controlling both GAG and aggrecan synthesis, disc cells can autoregulate their osmotic environment and accommodate mechanical loading."

https://openalex.org/W2002400344,"The SLC6 family of structurally related, Na(+)-dependent transporter proteins is responsible for presynaptic reuptake of the majority of neurotransmitters. Within this family are a number of orphan transporters, including NTT4/XT1 (SLC6A17), a protein first identified over 15 years ago. NTT4/XT1 is expressed exclusively in the nervous system and specifically on synaptic vesicles in glutamatergic and some GABAergic neurons. Despite extensive efforts by a number of groups, no substrate has been reported for NTT4/XT1. Here we use a combination of molecular manipulations to increase expression of the NTT4/XT1 protein at the plasma membrane and to directly demonstrate that it catalyzes neutral amino acid transport. The substrate profile of the NTT4/XT1-dependent activity is similar to that of the closely related B(0)AT2/SBAT1 (SLC6A15), including a submillimolar apparent affinity for proline and leucine and a low millimolar apparent affinity for glutamine. The transport activity is Na(+)-dependent and Cl(-)-independent and is inhibited by low pH as is SLC6A15, suggesting redundant roles for these proteins. This characterization of NTT4/XT1 offers important insights into neurotransmitter metabolism as well as the mechanistic differences among the structurally related, but functionally divergent, SLC6 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1982205070,"In eukaryotic cells, DNA polymerase delta (Poldelta), whose catalytic subunit p125 is encoded in the Pold1 gene, plays a central role in chromosomal DNA replication, repair, and recombination. However, the physiological role of the Poldelta in mammalian development has not been thoroughly investigated.To examine this role, we used a gene targeting strategy to generate two kinds of Pold1 mutant mice: Poldelta-null (Pold1(-/-)) mice and D400A exchanged Poldelta (Pold1(exo/exo)) mice. The D400A exchange caused deficient 3'-5' exonuclease activity in the Poldelta protein. In Poldelta-null mice, heterozygous mice developed normally despite a reduction in Pold1 protein quantity. In contrast, homozygous Pold1(-/-) mice suffered from peri-implantation lethality. Although Pold1(-/-) blastocysts appeared normal, their in vitro culture showed defects in outgrowth proliferation and DNA synthesis and frequent spontaneous apoptosis, indicating Poldelta participates in DNA replication during mouse embryogenesis. In Pold1(exo/exo) mice, although heterozygous Pold1(exo/+) mice were normal and healthy, Pold1(exo/exo) and Pold1(exo/-) mice suffered from tumorigenesis.These results clearly demonstrate that DNA polymerase delta is essential for mammalian early embryogenesis and that the 3'-5' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase delta is dispensable for normal development but necessary to suppress tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2071491189,"The application of pulsed, low intensity ultrasound is emerging as a potent therapy for the treatment of complex bone fractures and tissue damage. Ultrasonic stimuli accelerate fracture healing by up to 40% and enhance tendon and ligament healing by promoting cell proliferation, migration, and matrix synthesis through an unresolved mechanism. Ultrasound treatment also induces closure of nonunion fractures, at a success rate (85% of cases) similar to that of surgical intervention (68-96%) while avoiding the complications associated with surgery. The regulation of cell adhesion necessary for wound healing depends on cooperative engagement of the extracellular matrix receptors, integrin and syndecan, as exemplified by the wound healing defects observed in syndecan- and integrin-knock-out mice. This report distinguishes the influence of ultrasound on signals downstream of the prototypic fibronectin receptors, α5β1 integrin and syndecan-4, which cooperate to regulate Rac1 and RhoA. Ultrasonic stimulation fails to activate integrins or induce cell spreading on poor, electrostatic ligands. By contrast, ultrasound treatment overcomes the necessity of engagement or expression of syndecan-4 during the process of focal adhesion formation, which normally requires simultaneous engagement of both receptors. Ultrasound exerts an influence downstream of syndecan-4 and PKCα to specifically activate Rac1, itself a critical regulator of tissue repair, and to a lesser extent RhoA. The ability of ultrasound to bypass syndecan-4 signaling, which is known to facilitate efficient tissue repair, explains the reduction in healing times observed in ultrasound-treated patients. By substituting for one of the key axes of adhesion-dependent signaling, ultrasound therapy has considerable potential as a clinical technique. The application of pulsed, low intensity ultrasound is emerging as a potent therapy for the treatment of complex bone fractures and tissue damage. Ultrasonic stimuli accelerate fracture healing by up to 40% and enhance tendon and ligament healing by promoting cell proliferation, migration, and matrix synthesis through an unresolved mechanism.

The regulation of cell adhesion necessary for wound healing depends on cooperative engagement of the extracellular matrix receptors, integrin and syndecan, as exemplified by the wound healing defects observed in syndecan- and integrin-knock-out mice. This report distinguishes the influence of ultrasound on signals downstream of the prototypic fibronectin receptors, α5β1 integrin and syndecan-4, which cooperate to regulate Rac1 and RhoA. Ultrasonic stimulation fails to activate integrins or induce cell spreading on poor, electrostatic ligands. By contrast, ultrasound treatment overcomes the necessity of engagement or expression of syndecan-4 during the process of focal adhesion formation, which normally requires simultaneous engagement of both receptors. Ultrasound exerts an influence downstream of syndecan-4 and PKCα to specifically activate Rac1, itself a critical regulator of tissue repair, and to a lesser extent RhoA. The ability of ultrasound to bypass syndecan-4 signaling, which is known to facilitate efficient tissue repair, explains the reduction in healing times observed in ultrasound-treated patients. By substituting for one of the key axes of adhesion-dependent signaling, ultrasound therapy has considerable potential as a clinical technique. Therapeutic approaches to the treatment of tissue wounds and bone fractures differ from the treatment of pathogen infections, tumor development, or genetic disorders. Effective wound therapy should be noninvasive, by definition, to avoid causing further tissue damage and should augment intrinsic healing processes without inducing excessive cell proliferation or extracellular matrix (ECM) 3The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; BIM, bisindolylmaleimide I; PKC, protein kinase C; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mW, milliwatts; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA. synthesis that lead to scarring or malformation. The advantages of accelerating repair are significant, since they not only improve patient comfort but also reduce the risk of infection following injury or surgery. A recent advance in this area has been the application of low intensity, pulsed ultrasound to a wound area, through transducers coupled to the skin via a water-based gel. The physiological benefits of this approach to bone fracture healing have been startling, with the healing times of tibial and radial fractures reduced by almost 40% (1Heckman J.D. Ryaby J.P. McCabe J. Frey J.J. Kilcoyne R.F. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 1994; 76: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 2Kristiansen T.K. Ryaby J.P. McCabe J. Frey J.J. Roe L.R. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 1997; 79: 961-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and the maximum torque of healed femurs significantly enhanced following ultrasound treatment (3Azuma Y. Ito M. Harada Y. Takagi H. Ohta T. Jingushi S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Ultrasound is particularly beneficial for the treatment of nonunion fractures, which do not heal without intervention and are traditionally treated by surgical pinning of the bone. Ultrasound treatment results in the closure of 85% of nonunion fractures, a figure that is similar to the surgical success rate (68-96% of cases), but avoids the complications associated with surgery (4Gebauer D. Mayr E. Orthner E. Ryaby J.P. Ultrasound Med. Biol. 2005; 31: 1391-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Since 6.2 million fractures are reported annually, in the United States alone (5Praemer A. Furner S. Rice P.O. Musculoskeletal conditions in the United States. American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, Chicago, IL1992: 85-91Google Scholar), ultrasound has tremendous potential as a therapeutic device. Nevertheless, since the biological mechanism of action of ultrasound is unclear, it is currently only used on a small number of patients. Although the clinical benefits of ultrasound therapy have been established, surprisingly little is known about the cellular mechanism by which ultrasound accelerates healing. Bone repair can be conveniently divided into successive stages of inflammation, callus formation, and remodeling, and ultrasound exerts a particular influence over the inflammation and early callus formation stages, increasing deposition of ECM proteins, such as collagen and aggrecan (6Parvizi J. Parpura V. Greenleaf J.F. Bolander M.E. J. Orthop. Res. 2002; 20: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Optimization of the inflammatory response raises the possibility that ultrasound could also become a viable strategy for enhancing tissue regeneration. Although investigations into this hypothesis have not been rigorous enough to be conclusive, results from a small trial of patients with venous leg ulcers suggest that healing frequency might be improved by ultrasound (7Al-Kurdi D. Bell-Syer S. Flemming K. Cochrane Database Syst. Rev. 2008; 1CD001180Google Scholar), and in other studies, both the final tensile strength of healed rat tendons (8Ng C.O. Ng G.Y. See E.K. Leung M.C. Ultrasound Med. Biol. 2003; 29: 1501-1506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the rate of healing of rat knee ligaments (9Warden S.J. Avin K.G. Beck E.M. DeWolf M.E. Hagemeier M.A. Martin K.M. Am. J. Sports Med. 2006; 34: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) were improved by ultrasound treatment. The potential to augment a range of healing processes implies that the benefits of ultrasound therapy could be much broader than is currently appreciated. Ultrasound stimulation has been shown to activate a number of cellular signaling pathways, including those involving Erk (10Chen Y.J. Wang C.J. Yang K.D. Chang P.R. Huang H.C. Huang Y.T. Sun Y.C. Wang F.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), focal adhesion kinase (11Tang C.H. Yang R.S. Huang T.H. Lu D.Y. Chuang W.J. Huang T.F. Fu W.M. Mol.

Res. 2002; 20: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and cell proliferation (13Doan N. Reher P. Meghji S. Harris M. J. Oral. Maxillofac. Surg. 1999; 57: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, extensive gaps in the literature covering this relatively new field make it difficult to piece together an understanding of how any of the individual signals affect cell behavior. The processes that constitute tissue healing (proliferation, migration, differentiation, and ECM synthesis) each depend on signals activated during cell adhesion to the ECM. Cell adhesion is mediated by engagement of transmembrane ECM receptors of the integrin and syndecan families. Integrins interact with ECM molecules, such as fibronectin, through a direct protein-protein association (14Arnaout M.A. Mahalingam B. Xiong J.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 381-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), whereas syndecans bind to the polybasic regions of ECM molecules via glycosaminoglycan chains, which are covalently attached to the syndecan extracellular domain (15Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). There are examples of functional synergy between a number of integrin-syndecan pairs (16Morgan M.R. Humphries M.J. Bass M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 957-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and wound healing defects have been described in a number of syndecan- and integrin-knock-out mice (17Echtermeyer F. Streit M.

Leutgeb B. Krieg T. Eckes B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2007; 127: 467-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The most thoroughly characterized synergy exists between α5β1 integrin and syndecan-4, and both are overexpressed on fibroblasts and endothelial cells surrounding a dermal wound (22Cavani A. Zambruno G. Marconi A. Manca V. Marchetti M. Giannetti A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 600-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gallo R. Kim C. Kokenyesi R. Adzick N.S. Bernfield M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 676-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). There is extensive evidence that cooperative signaling by α5β1 integrin and syndecan-4 is necessary for focal adhesion formation during spreading on fibronectin (24Bloom L. Ingham K.C. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1521-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Woods A. Couchman J.R. Johansson S. Hook M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and the influence of each receptor on the small GTPases Rac1 and RhoA, which regulate membrane protrusion and cytoskeletal contraction, respectively (26Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar, 27Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev.

Schwartz M.A. Science. 2004; 303: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 determines GTP loading of Rac1, via PKCα (29Bass M.D. Roach K.A. Morgan M.R. Mostafavi-Pour Z. Schoen T. Muramatsu T. Mayer U. Ballestrem C. Spatz J.P. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), whereas α5β1 integrin regulates the association of GTP-bound Rac1 with the plasma membrane, which is necessary for the activation of downstream effectors (30Del Pozo M.A. Alderson N.B. Kiosses W.B. Chiang H.H. Anderson R.G. Schwartz M.A. Science. 2004; 303: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Consequently, simultaneous engagement of α5β1 integrin and syndecan-4 at the leading edge of a cell causes localized membrane protrusion and focal complex formation, resulting in directional migration toward exposed ECM that is critical for wound closure. In the present study, we examine the effect of ultrasound on adhesion-dependent signaling and demonstrate that ultrasound can drive focal adhesion formation on a minimal integrin-binding ECM. We find that ultrasound acts by activating Rac1 and is capable of doing so in the absence of activation or expression of syndecan-4 or PKCα. The ability of ultrasound stimulation to bypass the syndecan-4 signaling axis for Rac1 regulation provides a novel insight into the mode of action of an emerging clinical therapy that warrants further investigation. Antibodies and Reagents-Mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against vinculin (Sigma), Rac1, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated paxillin, PKCα, PKCδ, and PKC∈ (BD Transduction Laboratories) were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mouse monoclonal antibody raised against active human β1 integrin (12G10) was used as described previously (31Mould A.P. Garratt A.N. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Rat monoclonal antibody raised against inactive human β1 integrin (mab13) was a gift from Ken Yamada (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Cy2- and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgGs were purchased from Stratech Scientific, and Alexa Fluor680-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and TRITC-conjugated phalloidin were from Invitrogen. Recombinant fibronectin polypeptides encompassing type III repeats 6-10 (50K) and 12-15 (H/0) were expressed as recombinant polypeptides, as described previously (32Makarem R. Newham P. Askari J.A. Green L.J. Clements J. Edwards M. Humphries M.J. Mould A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4005-4011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and poly-l-lysine was purchased from Sigma. The plasmid encoding the GST-PAK-1 CRIB domain was a gift from Professor Kozo Kaibuchi (Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan). Cell Culture-The generation of immortalized wild-type and syndecan-4-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) has been described previously (29Bass M.D. Roach K.A. Morgan M.R. Mostafavi-Pour Z. Schoen T. Muramatsu T. Mayer U. Ballestrem C. Spatz J.P. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To allow expression of the large T antigen, the MEFs were cultured at 33 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine and 20 units/ml interferon-γ (Sigma). Primary human foreskin fibroblasts, passage number 8-25, were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, minimal essential medium vitamins, and 20 μg/ml gentamycin. 1-2 days before each experiment, cells were passaged to ensure an active proliferative state. K562 human lymphocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Lonza) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine. Cell Spreading and Adhesion Complex Formation Assays-For immunofluorescence, 13-mm diameter glass coverslips, placed into 6-well plates, were derivatized for 30 min with 1 mm sulfo-m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydrosuccinimide ester (Perbio). For spreading on mab13 monoclonal antibody, coverslips were precoated with 10 μg/ml goat anti-rat IgG Fc fragment (Stratech Scientific). For biochemical assays, 6-well tissue culture-treated plastic plates (Corning Glass) were coated directly with ligand. Coverslips or dishes were coated for 2 h at room temperature with 10 μg/ml 50K, H/0, poly-l-lysine, or mab13 in Dulbecco’s PBS containing calcium and magnesium (Lonza) and blocked with 10 mg/ml heat-denatured bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature (33Humphries M.J. Akiyama S.K. Komoriya A. Olden K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2637-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Equivalent ligand coating between glass and plastic was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the anti-fibronectin monoclonal antibody 333 (34Bass M.D. Morgan M.R. Humphries M.J. Eur. Phys. J. E. Soft Matter. 2007; 3: 372-376Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As described previously, cells were treated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) for 2 h, to prevent de novo synthesis of ECM and other syndecan-4 ligands, without compromising cell migration or signaling (29Bass M.D. Roach K.A. Morgan M.R. Mostafavi-Pour Z. Schoen T. Muramatsu T. Mayer U. Ballestrem C. Spatz J.P. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 35Couchman J.R. Hook M. Rees D.A. Timpl R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cells were detached with 0.5 mg/ml trypsin, resuspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 25 μg/ml cycloheximide, plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well, and allowed to spread at 37 °C for 2 h. Prespread cells were treated with 200 nm BIM (Calbiochem) for 30 min if appropriate and then stimulated with 10 μg/ml H/0 (40 min) or ultrasound (20 min), with or without pharmacological inhibitors, before fixing or preparing lysates. For extended time course experiments, ultrasound was only applied for the first 20 min of stimulation, in keeping with clinical ultrasound regimes, and cells were then maintained at 37 °C for the remainder of the duration, allowing the response to develop. For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 diluted in PBS, and blocked with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS. Fixed cells were stained for vinculin and actin, mounted in Prolong® Antifade (Invitrogen), and photographed on an Olympus BX51 microscope using a ×60 numerical aperture 1.40 PlanApo objective and Photometrics CoolSNAP ES camera. Images were compiled and analyzed using ImageJ software. The total area and integrated density of adhesion complexes per cell were calculated by recording the area of fluorescence intensity above an empirically determined threshold, following rolling ball background subtraction. The same threshold was used for all conditions within a single experiment. Ultrasound Stimulation-6-well plates containing prespread MEFs were mounted onto an array of six 2.5-cm diameter ultrasound transducers (Exogen 2000; Smith and Nephew Inc., Memphis, TN), the bases of the wells coupled to the transducers using water-based gel (Exogen). The transducers generated 30 mW cm-2 (spatial average temporal average) pulsed ultrasound with a 1.5-MHz wave frequency, pulsed at 1 kHz for a duration of 20 min. Flow Cytometry-For analysis of integrin activity by flow cytometry, K562 suspension cells were stimulated with ultrasound for 20 min, followed by centrifugation and resuspension in ice-cold medium. Cells were stained with primary antibody (12G10), diluted to 10 μg/ml in Dulbecco’s PBS containing calcium and magnesium (Lonza), 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide on ice for 1 h. The cells were washed with PBS, 1% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, followed by 10 μg/ml secondary antibody diluted in PBS, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum for 30 min. For manganese stimulation, all antibodies and wash buffers were supplemented with 1 mm MnCl2. Cells were then fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and analyzed on a Dako Cyan flow cytometer, using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. A 530/30-nm bandpass filter was used to detect the emissions. Rac1 Activation Assays-Active Rac1 was affinity-purified from lysates prepared in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 140 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 4 mm EGTA, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin using 300 μg of GST-PAK CRIB domain immobilized on agarose beads. Active GTPase was eluted in SDS-sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Transferred proteins were detected using the Odyssey Western blotting fluorescent detection system (LICOR Biosciences UK Ltd.). This involved blocking the membranes with casein blocking buffer (Sigma) and then incubating with the anti-Rac1 primary antibody diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. Membranes were washed with PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:5000 in blocking buffer, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. After rinsing the membrane, proteins were detected using an infrared imaging system that allowed both an image of the membrane and an accurate count of bound protein to be recorded. Equivalent loading between time points was confirmed by blotting the crude lysate for vinculin. The significance of changes in Rac1 activity was established using paired Student’s t tests of normally distributed small samples (n = 5-10). RhoA Activation Assays-A commercially available Rho enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was purchased from Tebu-bio and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, this involved capturing GTP-RhoA from clarified cell lysate in a 96-well plate coated with the Rho-binding domain of rhotekin. Captured RhoA was then cross-linked to the plate and detected by sequential incubations with an anti-RhoA primary antibody and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The relative amounts of bound RhoA were then measured by developing the plate with a horseradish peroxidase-sensitive dye, stopping development with dilute sulfuric acid and recording absorbance at 490 nm using a multiscan plate reader. Initial lysis steps were performed on ice and completed within 10 min to limit hydrolysis of bound GTP. Equivalent loading between time points was confirmed by total protein assay. The significance of changes in RhoA activity was established using paired Student's t tests of normally distributed small samples (n = 5-10). Solid Phase Binding Assays-96-well plates were coated with goat anti-human γ1-Fc (1:500 dilution in PBS; Stratech Scientific) overnight at 4 °C. Washed wells were coated for 2 h at room temperature with Fc-tagged α5β1 integrin extracellular domain, purified from CHO cell supernatant (36Coe A.P. Askari J.A. Kline A.D. Robinson M.K. Kirby H. Stephens P.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35854-35866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), before blocking for 1 h at room temperature with 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After blocking, the plates were washed three times with 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and stimulated with ultrasound for 20 min, prior to a 3-h incubation with 10 μg/ml biotinylated 50K diluted in wash buffer and in the presence of 10 μg/ml 12G10 as appropriate. Bound 50K was detected using extravidin-horseradish peroxidase, diluted 1:500 in wash buffer, and the plate was developed for 30 min using 0.1% (w/v) 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) in 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.05 m NaH2PO4, pH 5.0, 0.01% H2O2 (v/v). Absorbance readings were measured at 405 nm using an Opsys MR plate reader (Dynex Technologies). RNAi Knockdown of PKCα-An siRNA duplex of sequence (sense) GAAGGGUUCUCGUAUGUCAUU (with ON TARGET™ modification for enhanced specificity) and an siGLO®, nontargeting control duplex were purchased from Dharmacon (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 0.8 nmol of oligonucleotide was transfected into a 90% confluent 75-cm2 flask of wild-type MEFs using Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were passaged and then used for experiments after a further 24 h. Expression of PKCα was tested by Western blotting. Cell Migration-MEFs were spread on 50K-coated plates at 3 × 104 cells/well for 1.5 h before stimulation with ultrasound for 20 min or 10 μg/ml H/0. Time lapse images were captured at 10-min intervals for 12 h on a Leica AS MDW microscope using a ×5 numerical aperture 0.15 Fluotar objective and Photometrics Cascade II EM CCD camera, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The migration paths of all nondividing, nonclustered cells were tracked using Image J software to calculate the speed (distance/time) and the persistence (linear displacement of a cell/total distance migrated). Ultrasound Bypasses Syndecan-4 to Induce Focal Adhesion Formation-The adhesion of cells to fibronectin initiates a range of signaling cascades that result in organization of the cytoskeleton and the recruitment of molecules, including talin, vinculin, and paxillin, to integrin clusters to form focal adhesions. The formation of focal adhesions can be enhanced by the application of low intensity, pulsed ultrasound (37Zhou S. Schmelz A. Seufferlein T. Li Y. Zhao J. Bachem M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54463-54469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), which has led to the hypothesis that ultrasonic stimuli might modify or substitute for signals from ECM receptors. More incisive studies of ECM receptor function have revealed that engagement of syndecan-4, in addition to α5β1 integrin, is necessary for focal adhesion formation on fibronectin (24Bloom L. Ingham K.C. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1521-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Woods A. Couchman J.R. Johansson S. Hook M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 34Bass M.D. Morgan M.R. Humphries M.J. Eur. Phys. J. E. Soft Matter. 2007; 3: 372-376Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether ultrasound had a specific effect on either of these receptors or the pathways lying downstream. In order to differentiate between effects on α5β1 integrin or syndecan-4, MEFs were assayed for the ability to spread and form focal adhesions on recombinant ligands of α5β1 integrin and syndecan-4. To prevent the synthesis of de novo matrix that might compromise the interpretation of these experiments, protein synthesis was blocked by treatment with cycloheximide. As described previously (34Bass M.D. Morgan M.R. Humphries M.J. Eur. Phys. J. E. Soft Matter. 2007; 3: 372-376Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), MEFs plated onto a recombinant 50-kDa fragment of fibronectin (50K), encompassing the binding sites for α5β1 integrin (38Danen E.H. Aota S. van Kraats A.A. Yamada K.M. Ruiter D.J. van Muijen G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21612-21618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), failed to form lamellipodia with vinculin or paxillin-containing focal adhesions unless stimulated with a soluble syndecan-binding fragment of fibronectin, comprising type III repeats 12-15 (H/0) (Fig. 1B). Stimulation of MEFs, prespread on 50K, with low intensity (30 mW cm-2), pulsed ultrasound (1.5 MHz wave frequency, 1 kHz pulse frequency) for a duration of 20 min (Fig. 1A) resulted in the formation of lamellipodia with prominent focal adhesions that were strikingly similar to those formed in response to syndecan-4 engagement (Fig. 1B). The percentage of cells containing focal adhesions following stimulation with ultrasound was comparable with cells treated with H/0 and in both cases considerably higher than unstimulated cells (p = 0.0016 and p = 0.0092, respectively). The percentage of focal adhesion-positive cells was not improved further by the application of both stimuli compared with cells exposed to ultrasound or H/0 alone (Fig. 1C). Focal adhesion formation in response to H/0 or ultrasound was quantified further by measuring the total adhesion area per cell and revealed comparable responses to H/0 and ultrasound stimuli (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1A). Similar results were obtained from analysis of primary human fibroblasts (Fig. S1, C and D). Measurements of total integrated density of focal adhesions within a cell, which reflects the extent of vinculin clustering as well as area, also revealed no significant difference between H/0- or ultrasound-stimulated cells (Fig. 1E), and neither did measurements of focal adhesion length (Fig. 1F). These experiments demonstrate that ultrasound stimulation induces the formation of focal adhesions that are morpholog"
https://openalex.org/W2020520478,"An activity-dependent form of intermediate memory (AD-ITM) for sensitization is induced in Aplysia by a single tail shock that gives rise to plastic changes (AD-ITF) in tail sensory neurons (SNs) via the interaction of action potential firing in the SN coupled with the release of serotonin in the CNS. Activity-dependent long-term facilitation (AD-LTF, lasting >24hr) requires protein synthesis dependent persistent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and translocation to the SN nucleus. We now show that the induction of the earlier temporal phase (AD-ITM and AD-ITF), which is translation and transcription independent, requires the activation of a compartmentally distinct novel signaling cascade that links second messengers, MAPK and PKC into a unified pathway within tail SNs. Since both AD-ITM and AD-LTM require MAPK activity, these collective findings suggest that presynaptic SNs route the flow of molecular information to distinct subcellular compartments during the induction of activity-dependent long-lasting memories."
https://openalex.org/W2047101148,"A key goal for the perceptual system is to optimally combine information from all the senses that may be available in order to develop the most accurate and unified picture possible of the outside world. The contemporary theoretical framework of ideal observer maximum likelihood integration (MLI) has been highly successful in modelling how the human brain combines information from a variety of different sensory modalities. However, in various recent experiments involving multisensory stimuli of uncertain correspondence, MLI breaks down as a successful model of sensory combination. Within the paradigm of direct stimulus estimation, perceptual models which use Bayesian inference to resolve correspondence have recently been shown to generalize successfully to these cases where MLI fails. This approach has been known variously as model inference, causal inference or structure inference. In this paper, we examine causal uncertainty in another important class of multi-sensory perception paradigm – that of oddity detection and demonstrate how a Bayesian ideal observer also treats oddity detection as a structure inference problem. We validate this approach by showing that it provides an intuitive and quantitative explanation of an important pair of multi-sensory oddity detection experiments – involving cues across and within modalities – for which MLI previously failed dramatically, allowing a novel unifying treatment of within and cross modal multisensory perception. Our successful application of structure inference models to the new ‘oddity detection’ paradigm, and the resultant unified explanation of across and within modality cases provide further evidence to suggest that structure inference may be a commonly evolved principle for combining perceptual information in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2061774727,"Although leukemogenic tyrosine kinases (LTKs) activate a common set of downstream molecules, the phenotypes of leukemia caused by LTKs are rather distinct. Here we report the molecular mechanism underlying the development of hypereosinophilic syndrome/chronic eosinophilic leukemia by FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha. When introduced into c-Kit(high)Sca-1(+)Lineage(-) cells, FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha conferred cytokine-independent growth on these cells and enhanced their self-renewal, whereas it did not immortalize common myeloid progenitors in in vitro replating assays and transplantation assays. Importantly, FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha but not TEL-PDGFRbeta enhanced the development of Gr-1(+)IL-5Ralpha(+) eosinophil progenitors from c-Kit(high)Sca-1(+)Lineage(-) cells. FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha also promoted eosinophil development from common myeloid progenitors. Furthermore, when expressed in megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitors and common lymphoid progenitors, FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha not only inhibited differentiation toward erythroid cells, megakaryocytes, and B-lymphocytes but aberrantly developed eosinophil progenitors from megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitors and common lymphoid progenitors. As for the mechanism of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-induced eosinophil development, FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha was found to more intensely activate MEK1/2 and p38(MAPK) than TEL-PDGFRbeta. In addition, a MEK1/2 inhibitor and a p38(MAPK) inhibitor suppressed FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-promoted eosinophil development. Also, reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha augmented the expression of C/EBPalpha, GATA-1, and GATA-2, whereas it hardly affected PU.1 expression. In addition, short hairpin RNAs against C/EBPalpha and GATA-2 and GATA-3KRR, which can act as a dominant-negative form over all GATA members, inhibited FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-induced eosinophil development. Furthermore, FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha and its downstream Ras inhibited PU.1 activity in luciferase assays. Together, these results indicate that FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha enhances eosinophil development by modifying the expression and activity of lineage-specific transcription factors through Ras/MEK and p38(MAPK) cascades."
https://openalex.org/W1971831321,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) binds to and signals via two serine-threonine kinase receptors, type I (TbetaRI) and type II (TbetaRII). The oligomerization of TGF-beta receptors modulates ligand binding and receptor trafficking and may contribute to signal diversification. However, numerous features of the molecular domains that determine the homo- and hetero-oligomerization of full-length receptors at the cell surface and the mode of these interactions remain unclear. Here, we address these questions through computerized immunofluorescence co-patching and patch/fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements of different combinations of epitope-tagged receptors and their mutants in live cells. We show that TbetaRI and TbetaRII are present on the plasma membrane both as monomers and homo- and hetero-oligomers. The homodimerization of TbetaRII depends on a cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region (amino acid residues 200-220). In contrast, the cytoplasmic domain of TbetaRI is dispensable for its homodimerization. TbetaRI.TbetaRII hetero-oligomerization depends on the cytoplasmic domain of TbetaRI and on a C-terminal region of TbetaRII (residues 419-565). TGF-beta1 elevates TbetaRII homodimerization to some degree and strongly enhances TbetaRI.TbetaRII heteromeric complex formation. Both ligand-induced effects depend on the region encompassed between residues 200-242 of TbetaRII. Furthermore, the kinase activity of TbetaRI is also necessary for the latter effect. All forms of the homo- and hetero-oligomers, whether constitutively present on the membrane or formed upon TGF-beta1 stimulation, were stable in the time-scale of our patch/FRAP measurements. We suggest that the different forms of receptor oligomerization may serve as a basis for the heterogeneity of TGF-beta signaling responses."
https://openalex.org/W2027731098,"Macrophages are important effectors in the clearance of antibody-coated tumor cells. However, the signaling pathways that regulate macrophage-induced ADCC are poorly defined. To understand the regulation of macrophage-mediated ADCC, we used human B cell lymphoma coated with Rituximab as the tumor target and murine macrophages primed with IFNγ as the effectors. Our data demonstrate that the PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt pathway is activated during macrophage-induced ADCC and that the inhibition of PtdIns 3-kinase results in the inhibition of macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity. Interestingly, downstream of PtdIns 3-kinase, expression of constitutively active Akt (Myr-Akt) in macrophages significantly enhanced their ability to mediate ADCC. Further analysis revealed that in this model, macrophage-mediated ADCC is dependent upon the release of nitric oxide (NO). However, the PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt pathway does not appear to regulate NO production. An examination of the role of the PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt pathway in regulating conjugate formation indicated that macrophages treated with an inhibitor of PtdIns 3-kinase fail to polarize the cytoskeleton at the synapse and show a significant reduction in the number of conjugates formed with tumor targets. Further, inhibition of PtdIns 3-kinase also reduced macrophage spreading on Rituximab-coated surfaces. On the other hand, Myr-Akt expressing macrophages displayed a significantly greater ability to form conjugates with tumor cells. Taken together, these findings illustrate that the PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt pathway plays a critical role in macrophage ADCC through its influence on conjugate formation between macrophages and antibody-coated tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2070862753,"Pulmonary hemorrhage has been recognized as a major, often lethal, manifestation of severe leptospirosis albeit the pathogenesis remains unclear. The Leptospira interrogans virulent serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae serovar Lai encodes a protein (LA2144), which exhibited the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) activity in vitro similar to that of human serum with respect to its substrate affinity and specificity and thus designated L-PAF-AH. On the other hand, the primary amino acid sequence of L-PAF-AH is homologous to the α1-subunit of the bovine brain PAF-AH isoform I. The L-PAF-AH was proven to be an intracellular protein, which was encoded unanimously and expressed similarly in either pathogenic or saprophytic leptospires. Mongolian gerbil is an appropriate experimental model to study the PAF-AH level in serum with its basal activity level comparable to that of human while elevated directly associated with the course of pulmonary hemorrhage during severe leptospirosis. Mortality occurred around the peak of pulmonary hemorrhage, along with the transition of the PAF-AH activity level in serum, from the increasing phase to the final decreasing phase. Limited clinical data indicated that the serum activity of PAF-AH was likely to be elevated in the patients infected by L. interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae, but not in those infected by other less severe serogroups. Although L-PAF-AH might be released into the micro-environment via cell lysis, its PAF-AH activity apparently contributed little to this elevation. Therefore, the change of PAF-AH in serum not only may be influential for pulmonary hemorrhage, but also seems suitable for disease monitoring to ensure prompt clinical treatment, which is critical for reducing the mortality of severe leptospirosis."
https://openalex.org/W1998402141,"Programmed cell death is one of the most fascinating demonstrations of the plasticity of biological systems. It is classically described to act upstream of and govern major developmental patterning processes (e.g. inter-digitations in vertebrates, ommatidia in Drosophila). We show here the first evidence that massive apoptosis can also be controlled and coordinated by a pre-established pattern of a specific ‘master cell’ population. This new concept is supported by the development and validation of an original model of cell patterning. Ciona intestinalis eggs are surrounded by a three-layered follicular organization composed of 60 elongated floating extensions made of as many outer and inner cells, and indirectly spread through an extracellular matrix over 1200 test cells. Experimental and selective ablation of outer and inner cells results in the abrogation of apoptosis in respective remaining neighbouring test cells. In addition incubation of outer/inner follicular cell-depleted eggs with a soluble extract of apoptotic outer/inner cells partially restores apoptosis to apoptotic-defective test cells. The 60 inner follicular cells were thus identified as ‘apoptotic master’ cells which collectively are induction sites for programmed cell death of the underlying test cells. The position of apoptotic master cells is controlled by topological constraints exhibiting a tetrahedral symmetry, and each cell spreads over and can control the destiny of 20 smaller test cells, which leads to optimized apoptosis signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2046163105,"It remains a challenge to establish a straightforward genetic approach for controlling the probability of gene activation or knockout at a desired level. Here, we developed a method termed STARS: stochastic gene activation with genetically regulated sparseness. The stochastic expression was achieved by two cross-linked, mutually-exclusive Cre-mediated recombinations. The stochastic level was further controlled by regulating Cre/lox reaction kinetics through varying the intrachromosomal distance between the lox sites mediating one of the recombinations. In mammalian cell lines stably transfected with a single copy of different STARS transgenes, the activation/knockout of reporter genes was specifically controlled to occur in from 5% to 50% of the cell population. STARS can potentially provide a convenient way for genetic labeling as well as gene expression/knockout in a population of cells with a desired sparseness level."
https://openalex.org/W1983747549,"KSR1 (kinase suppressor of Ras 1) is a molecular scaffold and positive regulator of the Raf/MEK/ERK phosphorylation cascade. KSR1 is required for maximal ERK activation induced by growth factors and by some cytotoxic agents. We show here that KSR1 is also required for maximal ERK activation induced by UV light, ionizing radiation, or the DNA interstrand cross-linking agent mitomycin C (MMC). We further demonstrate a role for KSR1 in the reinitiation of the cell cycle and proliferation following cell cycle arrest induced by MMC. Cells lacking KSR1 underwent but did not recover from MMC-induced G2/M arrest. Expression of KSR1 allowed KSR1–/– cells to re-enter the cell cycle following MMC treatment. However, cells expressing a mutated form of KSR1 unable to bind ERK did not recover from MMC-induced cell cycle arrest, demonstrating the requirement for the KSR1-ERK interaction. In addition, constitutive activation of ERK was not sufficient to promote cell cycle reinitiation in MMC-treated KSR1–/– cells. Only cells expressing KSR1 recovered from MMC-induced cell cycle arrest. Importantly, MMC-induced DNA damage was repaired in KSR1–/– cells, as determined by resolution of γ-H2AX-containing foci.

To prevent potentially damaging DNA mutations, which may lead to either cell death or carcinogenesis, cells employ specific damage-sensing pathways that sense and respond to different types of DNA damage (1Sancar A.

Cells must halt proliferation until the damage is repaired to prevent passing damaged or mutated DNA to daughter cells. These cellular mechanisms respond to both mutations incurred by endogenous causes, such as DNA replication, and damage induced by ectopic agents.

ICLs are highly toxic to mammalian cells (37Dronkert M.L. Kanaar R. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 38Noll D.M. Mason T.M. Miller P.S. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 277-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). ICLs, such as those induced by cisplatin, MMC, or psoralen, covalently link the two strands of DNA and inhibit the strand separation required for replication and transcription (37Dronkert M.L. Kanaar R. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 38Noll D.M. Mason T.M. Miller P.S. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 277-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). As such, DNA cross-linking agents are potent chemotherapeutic agents for certain types of cancers. ICLs are sensed primarily in the S phase during DNA replication (1Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar, 39Andreassen P.R. D’Andrea A.D. Taniguchi T.

The replication machinery stalls upon encountering an ICL, resulting in recruitment of the sensor protein ATR to the site of damage. ATR phosphorylates and activates the effector kinase Chk1 (38Noll D.M. Mason T.M. Miller P.S. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 277-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 40Pichierri P. Rosselli F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1178-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Chk1 then phosphorylates and inactivates the phosphatase Cdc25 to cause cell cycle arrest (41Zeng Y. Forbes K.C. Wu Z. Moreno S. Piwnica-Worms H. Enoch T. Nature. 1998; 395: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 42Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). Cdc25 proteins normally dephosphorylate and activate cyclin·Cdk complexes to promote cell cycle progression (38Noll D.M. Mason T.M. Miller P.S. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 277-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 43Takizawa C.G. Morgan D.O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The arrest in cell cycle progression provides time for repair of the ICLs by a mechanism that requires XPF-ERCC1 (1Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar, 38Noll D.M. Mason T.M. Miller P.S. Chem.

Kanaar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5776-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which cell cycle arrest is lifted and the cells reenter the cell cycle following the repair of damaged DNA has not been well characterized. Here we present data that KSR1-mediated ERK activation is required for the efficient reinitiation of the cell cycle following induction of ICLs. Fibroblasts deficient in expression of KSR1 are impaired in cell cycle reinitiation and proliferation following treatment with the DNA cross-linking agent MMC. These data couple a mitogenic signaling cascade to the release from cell cycle arrest following DNA damage. Cell Culture and Generation of Stable Cell Lines-Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated from day 13.5 embryos from KSR1–/– and KSR1+/+ mice on a DBA1/LacJ background and were immortalized by a 3T9 protocol (26Nguyen A. Burack W.R. Stock J.L. Kortum R. Chaika O.V. Afkarian M. Muller W.J. Murphy K.M. Morrison D.K. Lewis R.E. McNeish J. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3035-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). MEFs were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Tissue Culture Biologicals), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 100 nm minimum Eagle’s medium nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Mediatech, Inc.) and were incubated at 37 °C in a 6% CO2 atmosphere. To re-express KSR1 in KSR1–/– MEFs (19Kortum R.L. Lewis R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4407-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), KSR1–/– MEFs were transduced with the MSCV bicistronic retrovirus encoding green fluorescent protein and KSR1 separated by an internal ribosomal entry site (a generous gift of Dr. Eric Gosink, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital). GFP-expressing cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The cells were excited at 488 nm and separated at 530/30 nm using a FACStar or FACSAria (BD Biosciences), with base-line fluorescence of uninfected cells having a mean intensity of 6 ± 0.5 (range 0–15). Post-sorted cells were assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Expression of ectopic KSR1 was detected by Western blot (19Kortum R.L. Lewis R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4407-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The average expression of ectopic KSR1 was within 3-fold of endogenous KSR1 expression in KSR1+/+ MEFs. KSR1.AAAP cells were generated similarly and as described previously (31Kortum R.L. Johnson H.J. Costanzo D.L. Volle D.J. Razidlo G.L. Fusello A.M. Shaw A.S. Lewis R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2202-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The constitutively activated MEK-ERK fusion protein (ERK2-MEK1-LA, a generous gift of Dr. Melanie Cobb, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) (48Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was digested from the pCMV5 vector and ligated into the pGEMT TA shuttle vector. XhoI restriction sites were added using polymerase chain reaction, and MEK-ERK was ligated into MSCV-IRES-YFP at XhoI restriction digest sites. MSCV-[MEK-ERK]-IRES-YFP was transfected alone or with MSCV-KSR1-IRES-GFP and an ecotropic packaging vector into 293T cells. Retroviral supernatant was collected and filtered 48 and 72 h post-transfection and was used to infect KSR1–/– MEFs. YFP positive and GFP/YFP double positive cells were isolated by flow cytometry using a FACSAria. The cells were excited at 488 nm, and GFP and YFP signals were discriminated with 505- and 535-nm long pass dichroic filters, respectively. Cells demonstrating the appropriate levels of fluorescence through both 513/30 nm (GFP) and 560/40 nm (YFP) were collected. Western Blotting-The cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Igepal (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm sodium vanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin (49Muller J. Ory S. Copeland T. Piwnica-Worms H. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 983-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Alternatively, some cells were lysed in 1× Laemmli sample buffer (48.75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m dithiothreitol) and were sonicated three times for 5 s each. For Western blot analysis, the lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR, 1:1 with PBS). The membranes were probed with primary antibodies diluted in Odyssey blocking buffer (1:1 with PBS). Chk1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ERK1/2, phospho-ERK Thr202/Tyr204, phospho-Chk1 Ser345 or Ser317, p38, phospho-p38 Thr180/Try182, SAPK/JNK, phospho-SAPK/JNK Thr183/Try185 (Cell Signaling Technology), and KSR1 (BD Biosciences) were used as primary antibodies. The membranes were probed with secondary antibodies diluted in Odyssey blocking buffer (1:1 with PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20. Secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG AlexaFluor 680 (Molecular Probes) and anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG IRDye 800 (Rockland Immunochemicals). Blots were scanned using the Odyssey system (LI-COR). Immunoreactive proteins were quantified using Odyssey software and analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Mitogenic Stimulation-MEFs were serum-starved for 4 h and treated with 100 ng/ml epidermal growth factor in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for the indicated times. The cells were lysed, and Western blot analysis was performed. DNA-damaging Agents-MEFs were treated with 0.5 μg/ml MMC (Sigma) for 2 h. MMC was washed out four times with PBS, and fresh medium was replaced for the indicated times. The cells were treated with UV-C irradiation (254 nm) at a dose of 5 J/m2 using a Spectroline ENF-280C irradiator. The cells were treated with IR at a dose of 8 Gy using a Mark I 68A irradiator and an X-2 attenuator. To determine cell viability and survival, MTT assays, Trypan blue staining, and colony forming assays were performed. For the MTT assay, the cells were plated in 96-well plates at 1.5 × 103 cells/well and were allowed to incubate for 24 h prior to treatment. The cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of MMC and incubated for 5 days. On day 5, MTT was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. MMC and MTT were removed, and Me2SO was added. Absorbance at 570 nm was determined by spectrometry. Cytotoxicity was expressed as the percentage of A570 of treated cells relative to untreated cells. For Trypan blue staining, MEFs were seeded at low density in 12-well plates. After 24 h, the cells were treated with MMC (0.5 μg/ml) for 2 h. MMC was removed by washing four times with PBS, and normal culture medium was replaced. After 3 days the cells and medium supernatant were collected, and the cells were counted in the presence of Trypan blue. The number of Trypan blue-positive (dead) cells was divided by the total number of cells to determine the percentage of cell death. For the colony forming assay, MEFs were seeded at 4.0 × 103 cells/10-cm dish 24 h prior to treatment. The cells were then treated with 0.5 μg/ml MMC for 2 h. MMC was removed by washing cells with PBS four times, and normal culture medium was replaced. The cells were stained using Giemsa stain after 1 week. Three fields per plate were analyzed by phase contrast microscopy, and individual colonies were evaluated for the number of cells present. To assess Chk1 phosphorylation, MEFs were treated with varying concentrations of MMC (0.5–50 μg/ml) for 8 h. The increased dose and time of treatment were necessary to detect Chk1 activation in our pool of asynchronous cells. Cell Cycle Analysis-Cell cycle analysis was performed by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. The cells were treated with MMC (0.5 μg/ml) for 6 h or IR (8 Gy). Treatment for 6 h with MMC was necessary to detect cell cycle arrest by flow cytometry. MMC was removed by washing four times with PBS, and fresh medium was replaced. The cells were harvested using trypsin 0–48 h post-treatment, fixed in cold 70% ethanol, and stained for DNA content using Telford reagent. DNA was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur). The cytokinesis block proliferation index (CBPI) checkpoint assay was used to assess cell cycle arrest in S or G2 phase by scoring cells as mono- or binucleated (50Fenech M. Morley A.A. Mutat. Res. 1985; 147: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar, 51Stiff T. Reis C. Alderton G.K. Woodbine L. O’Driscoll M. Jeggo P.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The cells were plated on coverslips at very low density. After 24 h, the cells were treated with either MMC (0.5 μg/ml for 2 h), UV (5 J/m2), IR (8 Gy), or left untreated. MMC was removed by washing four times with PBS. The cells were then fed with fresh medium containing the actin inhibitor cytochalasin B (5 μg/ml) to inhibit cytokinesis. After 0, 24, or 48 h of cytochalasin B treatment, the cells were swollen with 75 mm KCl for 10 min and were fixed with cold methanol:acetone (1:1) at –20 °C for 30 min. The cells were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 2 min at room temperature, and the nuclei were stained using Hoechst dye 33258. The cells were analyzed using phase contrast and fluorescent microscopy (filter set UV-2E/C; excitation 330–380 nm, dichromatic mirror 400, barrier filter emission 435–485 nm) and were scored as having one or two nuclei. Binucleated cells were those that had entered mitosis and were arrested prior to cytokinesis by cytochalasin B. Mononucleated cells were those that had arrested in the cell cycle because of treatment with exogenous agents and had not yet entered mitosis. The percentage of binucleated cells was determined for each condition. H2AX Detection-The formation of nuclear foci containing phosphorylated histone H2AX was assessed by immunofluorescence. The cells were seeded at low density on coverslips. After 24 h the cells were treated with MMC (0.5 μg/ml) for 2 h. MMC was removed by washing four times with PBS, and fresh medium was replaced. The coverslips were processed 0, 2, 24, or 48 h after MMC treatment. The cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and then washed twice with PBS. The cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and nonspecific binding was blocked with 50% Odyssey blocking buffer in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were probed with an anti-γ-H2AX primary antibody (Upstate) and an anti-goat-Cy3 secondary antibody. The nuclei were counterstained using Hoechst dye 33258. The nuclei were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using the appropriate filters, and photomicrographs were obtained using IPLab software. The number of foci per nucleus was determined in at least 100 cells/condition. Proliferation Studies-The cells were seeded at 4.0 × 104 cells/35-mm-diameter dish. Triplicate dishes were counted every 48 h for total cell number on a Beckman Coulter counter. Transformation Assay-To assess lack of contact-inhibited growth, MEFs were seeded at 105 cells/10-cm-diameter dish. The medium was changed every 2–3 days. The photomicrographs were taken after 1 week. Statistical Analysis-The data are presented as the means ± standard deviation. Statistical analyses were performed using a Student’s t test where p < 0.05 was considered significant.

https://openalex.org/W2092266655,"Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 (IRF-1) is a member of the IRF family of transcription factors, which have key and diverse roles in the gene-regulatory networks of the immune system. IRF-1 has been described as a critical mediator of IFN-gamma signalling and as the major player in driving TH1 type responses. It is therefore likely to be crucial in both innate and adaptive responses against intracellular pathogens such as Plasmodium falciparum. Polymorphisms at the human IRF1 locus have been previously found to be associated with the ability to control P. falciparum infection in populations naturally exposed to malaria. In order to test whether genetic variation at the IRF1 locus also affects the risk of developing severe malaria, we performed a family-based test of association for 18 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the gene in three African populations, using genotype data from 961 trios consisting of one affected child and his/her two parents (555 from The Gambia, 204 from Kenya and 202 from Malawi). No significant association with severe malaria or severe malaria subphenotypes (cerebral malaria and severe malaria anaemia) was observed for any of the SNPs/haplotypes tested in any of the study populations. Our results offer no evidence that the molecular pathways regulated by the transcription factor IRF-1 are involved in the immune-based pathogenesis of severe malaria."
