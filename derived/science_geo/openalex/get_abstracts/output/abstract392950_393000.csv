https://openalex.org/W2111581388,"Rapid advancing computational technologies have greatly speeded up the development of computer-aided drug design (CADD). Recently, pharmaceutical companies have increasingly shifted their attentions toward traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for novel lead compounds. Despite the growing number of studies on TCM, there is no free 3D small molecular structure database of TCM available for virtual screening or molecular simulation. To address this shortcoming, we have constructed TCM Database@Taiwan (http://tcm.cmu.edu.tw/) based on information collected from Chinese medical texts and scientific publications. TCM Database@Taiwan is currently the world's largest non-commercial TCM database. This web-based database contains more than 20,000 pure compounds isolated from 453 TCM ingredients. Both cdx (2D) and Tripos mol2 (3D) formats of each pure compound in the database are available for download and virtual screening. The TCM database includes both simple and advanced web-based query options that can specify search clauses, such as molecular properties, substructures, TCM ingredients, and TCM classification, based on intended drug actions. The TCM database can be easily accessed by all researchers conducting CADD. Over the last eight years, numerous volunteers have devoted their time to analyze TCM ingredients from Chinese medical texts as well as to construct structure files for each isolated compound. We believe that TCM Database@Taiwan will be a milestone on the path towards modernizing traditional Chinese medicine."
https://openalex.org/W1991943452,"Recent statistical analyses suggest that sequencing of pooled samples provides a cost effective approach to determine genome-wide population genetic parameters. Here we introduce PoPoolation, a toolbox specifically designed for the population genetic analysis of sequence data from pooled individuals. PoPoolation calculates estimates of θWatterson, θπ, and Tajima's D that account for the bias introduced by pooling and sequencing errors, as well as divergence between species. Results of genome-wide analyses can be graphically displayed in a sliding window plot. PoPoolation is written in Perl and R and it builds on commonly used data formats. Its source code can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/popoolation/. Furthermore, we evaluate the influence of mapping algorithms, sequencing errors, and read coverage on the accuracy of population genetic parameter estimates from pooled data."

https://openalex.org/W2053954823,"Cholangiocarcinoma, also known as bile duct cancer, is the second most common primary hepatic carcinoma with a median survival of less than 2 years. The molecular mechanisms underlying the development of this disease are not clear. To survey activated tyrosine kinases signaling in cholangiocarcinoma, we employed immunoaffinity profiling coupled to mass spectrometry and identified DDR1, EPHA2, EGFR, and ROS tyrosine kinases, along with over 1,000 tyrosine phosphorylation sites from about 750 different proteins in primary cholangiocarcinoma patients. Furthermore, we confirmed the presence of ROS kinase fusions in 8.7% (2 out of 23) of cholangiocarcinoma patients. Expression of the ROS fusions in 3T3 cells confers transforming ability both in vitro and in vivo, and is responsive to its kinase inhibitor. Our data demonstrate that ROS kinase is a promising candidate for a therapeutic target and for a diagnostic molecular marker in cholangiocarcinoma. The identification of ROS tyrosine kinase fusions in cholangiocarcinoma, along with the presence of other ROS kinase fusions in lung cancer and glioblastoma, suggests that a more broadly based screen for activated ROS kinase in cancer is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2121647638,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain (IgH) class switch recombination (CSR) and Ig variable region somatic hypermutation (SHM) in B lymphocytes by deaminating cytidines on template and nontemplate strands of transcribed DNA substrates. However, the mechanism of AID access to the template DNA strand, particularly when hybridized to a nascent RNA transcript, has been an enigma. We now implicate the RNA exosome, a cellular RNA-processing/degradation complex, in targeting AID to both DNA strands. In B lineage cells activated for CSR, the RNA exosome associates with AID, accumulates on IgH switch regions in an AID-dependent fashion, and is required for optimal CSR. Moreover, both the cellular RNA exosome complex and a recombinant RNA exosome core complex impart robust AID- and transcription-dependent DNA deamination of both strands of transcribed SHM substrates in vitro. Our findings reveal a role for noncoding RNA surveillance machinery in generating antibody diversity."

The discrepancies may be attributed to unreliable detection probes and/or inconsistent affinity standards. In this study, application of the four CuI ligand probes bicinchoninate, bathocuproine disulfonate, dithiothreitol (Dtt), and glutathione (GSH) is reviewed, and their CuI affinities are re-estimated and unified. Excess bicinchoninate or bathocuproine disulfonate reacts with CuI to yield distinct 1:2 chromatophoric complexes [CuIL2]3− with formation constants β2 = 1017.2 and 1019.8 m−2, respectively. These constants do not depend on proton concentration for pH ≥7.0. Consequently, they are a pair of complementary and stable probes capable of detecting free Cu+ concentrations from 10−12 to 10−19 m. Dtt binds CuI with KD ∼10−15 m at pH 7, but it is air-sensitive, and its CuI affinity varies with pH. The CuI binding properties of Atox1 and related proteins (including the fifth and sixth domains at the N terminus of the Wilson protein ATP7B) were assessed with these probes. The results demonstrate the following: (i) their use permits the stoichiometry of high affinity CuI binding and the individual quantitative affinities (KD values) to be determined reliably via noncompetitive and competitive reactions, respectively; (ii) the scattered literature values are unified by using reliable probes on a unified scale; and (iii) Atox1-type proteins bind CuI with sub-femtomolar affinities, consistent with tight control of labile Cu+ concentrations in living cells.

The human metallo-chaperone protein Atox1 (known also as Hah1) delivers CuI to the trans-Golgi network (1Hamza I. Schaefer M. Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

They both feature the classic ferredoxin βαββαβ-fold with a CXXC motif acting as a high affinity CuI-binding site (Fig. 1) (4Wernimont A.K. Huffman D.L. Lamb A.L. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat.

Homologues are found in cyanobacteria (Atx1), in Enterococcus hirae (CopZ), in Bacillus subtilis (CopZ), and in many other organisms (6Banci L. Bertini I. McGreevy K.S. Rosato A. Nat. Prod.

Bertini I. McGreevy K.S. Rosato A. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2010; 27: 695-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It appears that, for some CuI-ATPases at least, metal-binding sites in the transmembrane domain may also independently receive CuI from copper chaperones (9González-Guerrero M. Argüello J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5992-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The overall molecular structure and binding site of each MBD is similar to that of Atox1 (10Kaplan J.H.

Accurate estimation of affinities for CuI (as expressed by the dissociation constant KD) is essential for a quantitative understanding of reactivity and mechanisms of action. Yet reported KD values are scattered widely as highlighted by those of Atox1-type proteins, which differ by more than 10 orders of magnitude (KD ∼10−5, 10−10, 10−14, and 10−18 m) even though the structures and metal-binding sites of these proteins essentially superimpose (11Xiao Z.

The various values were determined via different experimental approaches with different ligand probes and affinity standards. The affinities of some of the probes and standards remain in dispute. In addition, the intrinsic instability of free Cu+ in aqueous solution and the tendency to aerial oxidation of cysteine ligands impose special conditions on these experiments. These aspects are complicated further by reports that thiol ligands such as endogenous glutathione (GSH) may expand the CuI coordination sphere in these proteins or lead to polymeric forms (14Miras R. Morin I. Jacquin O. Cuillel M. Guillain F. Mintz E. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2008; 13: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Ralle M. Lutsenko S. Blackburn N.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9324-9326Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In an attempt to resolve these fundamental issues for this iconic set of proteins, this study surveys the literature values for the CuI affinities of the four probe ligands bicinchoninate (Bca), bathocuproine disulfonate (Bcs), dithiothreitol (Dtt), and glutathione (GSH) (Scheme 1). By direct experimental comparison, their relative affinities are unified with the single standard Bcs whose absolute formation constant is also documented. Then the affinities of Atx1, Atox1, and related proteins are re-estimated or recalculated accordingly, allowing a coherent system to be established for quantitative determination and comparison of CuI binding affinities. Na2Bca, Na2Bcs, and GSH were purchased from Sigma and Dtt from Astral Scientific and were used as received. Concentrations of Bca and Bcs solutions were standardized routinely as described previously (19Djoko K.Y. Xiao Z. Huffman D.L. Wedd A.G. Inorg. Chem. 2007; 46: 4560-4568Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of Dtt and GSH were both prepared in deoxygenated Milli-Q water and stored in an anaerobic glove box. Their concentrations based on quantitative dissolution were confirmed and calibrated with the Ellman assay (20Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20884) Google Scholar). The copper standards were either purchased from Aldrich as an atomic absorption standard solution or prepared directly from the salt [CuI(CH3CN)4]ClO4, prepared, and purified according to the literature (21Kubas G.J. Inorg. Syntheses. 1990; 28: 68-70Google Scholar). Atox1 was expressed from an expression plasmid pET20b-Atox1 transformed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells, and the expressed Atox1 protein was purified by gradient elution (0–0.3 m NaCl) from a cation-exchange CM-52 column equilibrated in an acetate buffer (20 mm; pH 5.4; 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). This was followed by a Superdex-75 FPLC gel filtration column in KPi buffer (20 mm; pH 7.0; 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine). Atx1 and the N-terminal MBDs 5 and 6 of human Wilson protein (WLN5–6) were expressed and isolated as detailed previously (11Xiao Z. Loughlin F. George G.N. Howlett G.J. Wedd A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3081-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 22Achila D. Banci L. Bertini I. Bunce J. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 5729-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A CopC protein variant CopC-H48C, which binds CuI with higher affinity than wild type CopC, was also generated and purified as reported previously (23Zhang L. Koay M. Maher M.J. Xiao Z. Wedd A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 5834-5850Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The purity of the proteins was confirmed as >95% by SDS-PAGE and the identity by ESI-MS. As reported previously (17Ralle M. Lutsenko S. Blackburn N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23163-23170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), two components (7401.7 and 7270.5 Da) were detected in the Atox1 preparation, corresponding to molecules with and without the first methionine residue, respectively. All proteins were isolated in apo-forms with no detectable copper or zinc content. Prior to the copper binding studies, apoproteins were reduced fully by incubation overnight with Dtt (5 mm) in a glove box under dinitrogen and separated from the reductant via a Bio-Gel P-6 DG gel desalting column (Bio-Rad) in the glove box. Protein concentrations were estimated by three independent approaches as follows: (i) solution absorbance at 280 nm with reported extinction coefficients; (ii) thiol content analyzed with Ellman reagent, 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), employing ϵ418 = 13,600 m−1 cm−1 for the released chromophore 5-mercapto-2-nitrobenzoate (20Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20884) Google Scholar); and (iii) CuI binding stoichiometries estimated via CuI reagent [CuI(Bca)2]3−. The protein concentrations estimated by the approaches ii and iii matched each other exactly (see below), whereas the concentrations estimated by approach i fluctuated slightly (<20% variation), especially for those proteins with low extinction coefficients at 280 nm. Such small fluctuation is likely caused by the contribution to the absorbance of other minor adventitious components, and consequently the protein concentrations estimated via the approaches ii and iii were used for the final calculations. Fully reduced apo-Atx1, apo-Atox1, apo-WLN5–6, and apo-CopC-H48C contain 2, 3, 5, and 1 eq of cysteine thiol, respectively. Although Atx1, Atox1, and CopC-H48C react with 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) quantitatively within several minutes, reaction of 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) with WLN5–6 takes >10 min to complete. However, addition of urea (to ∼3 m) accelerates the reaction considerably. The determination was based on the Bjerrum method, i.e. the competition for ligand Bcs between Cu2+ and protons was followed by pH titration with HClaq (24Albert A. Serjeant E.P. The Determination of Ionisation Constants: A Laboratory Manual. Cambridge University Press, London1984: 176-191Google Scholar) as shown in Reactions 1 and 2, [CuII(Bcs)2(H2O)]2−+H+⇌[CuII(Bcs)(H2O)x]+[HBcs]−REACTION 1 [CuII(Bcs)2(H2O)x]+H+⇌Cu2+aq+[HBcs]−REACTION-2 Formation constants K1 and β2 of the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes, respectively, were derived by a graphical solution of Equation 1 (supplemental Fig. S1).

Ka is the acid dissociation constant of [HBcs]−, and [H] is the proton concentration determined by a pH meter. The free ligand concentration [Bcs] was determined from a mass balance of proton concentration according to Equation 3, [Bcs]=([HCl]total−[H]+Kw/[H])/[H]/Ka(Eq. 3) where Kw/[H] is the proton concentration derived from the self-ionization of water.

Donnelly P.S. Zimmermann M. Wedd A.G. Inorg. Chem. 2008; 47: 4338-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This value was consolidated in this work with another CuI-binding protein CopC-H48C that competes more effectively with both Bca and Bcs under the same conditions (Table 1). The experimental details follow those for Atx1-type proteins as detailed below. The experiments were performed in an anaerobic glove box by reaction of apoproteins with [CuIL2]3− (L = Bca or Bcs) in deoxygenated buffers, as described previously (11Xiao Z. Loughlin F. George G.N.

Briefly, apoprotein was titrated into solutions of [CuIL2]3− of defined molar ratio L:CuI ≥2.5 (to ensure the presence of the 1:2 complex [CuIL2]3− with negligible contribution from the 1:1 complex [CuIL]−). The reaction mixtures were diluted to a fixed volume to provide a series of solutions with constant total concentrations of CuI and ligand L but varying concentrations of protein P. Transfer of CuI from [CuIL2]3− to P was established by the change in absorbance at 483 nm for L = Bcs (ϵ = 13,000 m−1 cm−1) and at 562 nm for L = Bca (ϵ 7,900 m−1 cm−1) (11Xiao Z. Loughlin F.

Systematic variation of ligands L and their concentrations defined conditions that favored either competitive or noncompetitive reactions. The metal binding stoichiometry was derived from the noncompetitive reactions, whereas the dissociation constants were estimated from competitive reactions, according to Reaction 4 and Equation 5 (29Xiao Z.

Open table in a new tab The method was the same as that for the proteins with minor modifications. Solutions of Dtt in H2O at concentrations >1 mm are stable for at least 1 week under anaerobic conditions. However, they are air-sensitive in buffered solutions at pH ≥7 and can be oxidized significantly by trace dioxygen (see e.g. Fig. 5). Therefore, the effective concentrations of Dtt were verified prior to each experiment by the Ellman assay. Dithionite (∼4 mm) was included in the reaction mixture to scavenge trace dioxygen before addition of Dtt. Results for determination of the apparent dissociation constant KD′ at pH 6.8 and 7.3 are given in Tables 2 and supplemental Table S3. The two bidentate di-anions Bca and Bcs are classic chromophoric ligands for CuI (Scheme 1). They are water-soluble and are proposed to buffer free Cu+ concentrations over the respective ranges 10−12–10−16 and 10−15–10−19 m (29Xiao Z. Wedd A.G. Nat. Prod.

Consequently, they are a pair of complementary CuI probes with versatile applications in quantitative study of copper chemistry in biology (29Xiao Z. Wedd A.G. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2010; 27: 768-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, the overall formation constant β2 for both ligands are in dispute (see below), and those for Bcs were reported as either unpublished or undocumented data only in Refs. 11Xiao Z. Loughlin F.

It is important to provide proper documentation and confirmation of these two formation constants if the probes are to form the foundation of a reliable and unified scale. The presence of methyl groups at the 2- and 9-positions of the 1,10-phenanthroline ligands Bcs and neocuproine (Scheme 1) provides steric hindrance at the coordination site, favoring CuI binding (tetrahedral preference) over CuII binding (square planar preference). Consequently, the reduction potentials of the redox couple CuII/CuI of these ligands are positive (0.64 V versus NHE; see Ref. 25Djoko K.Y. Chong L.X. Wedd A.G. Xiao Z. J. Am. Chem.

In potentiometric titrations, the acid dissociation constant of H2Bcs is not detected (Fig. 2a) and so that for [HBcs]− only was considered in (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3) for pH >2.7. Experimentally, a solution of Na2Bcs of known concentration (∼4 mm; 10 ml) in H2O (0.1 m NaNO3) was titrated with a standard solution of HClaq (98.6 mm) at 20 °C. The pKa value was estimated from the mid-point of the titration curve after 0.5 eq of HClaq had been added, providing a value of pKa = 5.7 (Fig. 2a), consistent with the literature value pKa = 5.8 (31Blair D. Diehl H. Talanta. 1961; 7: 163-174Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Equivalent titrations in the presence of CuCl2 (∼0.50 eq) induced competition between Cu2+ and H+ for Bcs according to Reactions 1 and 2 (Fig. 2b), allowing estimation of the CuII formation constants log K1 = ∼5.6 and log β2 = 11.8 by the Bjerrum method (24Albert A. Serjeant E.P. The Determination of Ionisation Constants: A Laboratory Manual. Cambridge University Press, London1984: 176-191Google Scholar). The data were processed according to Equations 2 and 3 and a graphical solution of Equation 1. Results are presented in Fig. 2b and in Table 1 and supplemental Table S1.

The propensity of Cu+aq to disproportionation prevents determination of the formation constants of [CuI(Bcs)2]3− by the Bjerrum method. However, the couple CuII/CuI in the presence of more than 2 eq of Bcs is chemically reversible (ΔEp = 100 mV at ν = 20 mV s−1; Ic/Ia = ∼1), allowing accurate estimation of the reversible potential E′m = 0.64 V versus NHE (25Djoko K.Y. Chong L.X. Wedd A.G. Xiao Z. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).

The reversible redox chemistry is attributed to Reaction 3 and log β2 = 19.9 may be estimated for [CuI(Bcs)2]3− from the Nernst relationship (Equation 4). This estimate is consistent with those (19.1–19.5) reported previously for the parent ligand neocuproine and consolidates the previous value (log β2 = 19.8) reported for the same ligand (Table 1 and Scheme 1), but it is lower than a recent value of log β2 = 22.1 at pH 6, which was estimated by competition for CuI with cyanide (14Miras R.

https://openalex.org/W1991127474,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) induced differentiation of human lung fibroblasts to myofibroblasts is a key event in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Although the typical TGFβ signaling pathway involves the Smad family of transcription factors, we have previously reported that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) ligands inhibit TGFβ-mediated differentiation of human lung fibroblasts to myofibroblasts via a Smad-independent pathway. TGFβ also activates the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway leading to phosphorylation of AktS473. Here, we report that PPAR-γ ligands, 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) and 15-deoxy-(12,14)-15d-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), inhibit human myofibroblast differentiation of normal and idiopathic pulmonary fibrotic (IPF) fibroblasts, by blocking Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 by a PPAR-γ-independent mechanism. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and a dominant-negative inactive kinase-domain mutant of Akt both inhibited TGFβ-stimulated myofibroblast differentiation, as determined by Western blotting for α-smooth muscle actin and calponin. Prostaglandin A1 (PGA1), a structural analogue of 15d-PGJ2 with an electrophilic center, also reduced TGFβ-driven phosphorylation of Akt, while CAY10410, another analogue that lacks an electrophilic center, did not; implying that the activity of 15d-PGJ2 and CDDO is dependent on their electrophilic properties. PPAR-γ ligands inhibited TGFβ-induced Akt phosphorylation via both post-translational and post-transcriptional mechanisms. This inhibition is independent of MAPK-p38 and PTEN but is dependent on TGFβ-induced phosphorylation of FAK, a kinase that acts upstream of Akt. Thus, PPAR-γ ligands inhibit TGFβ signaling by affecting two pro-survival pathways that culminate in myofibroblast differentiation. Further studies of PPAR-γ ligands and small electrophilic molecules may lead to a new generation of anti-fibrotic therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2142215500,"Amyloid peptide (Aβ) is generated by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase (Bace1) and γ-secretase. Aβ production increases after plasma membrane cholesterol loading through unknown mechanisms. To determine how APP-Bace1 proximity affects this phenomenon, we developed a fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy-Förster resonance energy transfer (FLIM-FRET) technique for visualization of these molecules either by epifluorescence or at the plasma membrane only using total internal reflection fluorescence. Further, we used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to determine the lipid rafts partition of APP-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and Bace1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) molecules at the plasma membrane of neurons. We show that less than 10 min after cholesterol exposure, Bace1-GFP/APP-mCherry proximity increases selectively at the membrane and APP relocalizes to raft domains, preceded by rapid endocytosis. After longer cholesterol exposures, APP and Bace1 are found in proximity intracellularly. We demonstrate that cholesterol loading does not increase Aβ production by having a direct impact on Bace1 catalytic activity but rather by altering the accessibility of Bace1 to its substrate, APP. This change in accessibility is mediated by clustering in lipid rafts, followed by rapid endocytosis."

Potential mechanisms for the protective effect of AQP4 deficiency were investigated, including AQP4-dependent leukocyte and microglia cell function, immune cell entry in the central nervous system (CNS), intrinsic neuroinflammation, and humoral immune response. As we found with active-immunization EAE, neuroinflammation was greatly reduced in AQP4-knockout mice in adoptive-transfer EAE. AQP4 was absent in immune cells, including activated T lymphocytes. The CNS migration of fluo-rescently labeled, MOG-sensitized T lymphocytes was comparable in wild-type and AQP4-knockout mice. Microglia did not express AQP4. Serum anti-AQP4 antibodies were absent in EAE. Remarkably, intracerebral injection of LPS produced much greater neuroinflammation in wild-type than in AQP4-knockout mice, and cytokine (TNF-α and IL-6) secretion was reduced in astrocyte cultures from AQP4-knockout mice. Ade-novirus-mediated expression of AQP4, or of an unrelated aquaporin, AQP1, increased cytokine secretion in astrocyte and nonastrocyte cell cultures, supporting the involvement of aquaporin water permeability in cyto-kine secretion. Our data suggest an intrinsic proinflammatory role of AQP4 involving AQP4-dependent astrocyte swelling and cytokine release. Reduction in AQP4 water transport may be protective in neuroinflammatory CNS diseases.—Li, L., Zhang, H., Varrin-Doyer, M., Zamvil, S. S., Verkman, A. S.

https://openalex.org/W1970995808,"Sirtuins are a family of protein lysine deacetylases, which regulate gene silencing, metabolism, life span, and chromatin structure. Sirtuins utilize NAD(+) to deacetylate proteins, yielding O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPr) as a reaction product. The macrodomain is a ubiquitous protein module known to bind ADP-ribose derivatives, which diverged through evolution to support many different protein functions and pathways. The observation that some sirtuins and macrodomains are physically linked as fusion proteins or genetically coupled through the same operon, provided a clue that their functions might be connected. Indeed, here we demonstrate that the product of the sirtuin reaction OAADPr is a substrate for several related macrodomain proteins: human MacroD1, human MacroD2, Escherichia coli YmdB, and the sirtuin-linked MacroD-like protein from Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, we show that the cell extracts derived from MacroD-deficient Neurospora crassa strain exhibit a major reduction in the ability to hydrolyze OAADPr. Our data support a novel function of macrodomains as OAADPr deacetylases and potential in vivo regulators of cellular OAADPr produced by NAD(+)-dependent deacetylation."
https://openalex.org/W1976473730,"Natural T regulatory cells (Tregs) are challenging to expand ex vivo, and this has severely hindered in vivo evaluation of their therapeutic potential. All trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plays an important role in mediating immune homeostasis in vivo, and we investigated whether ATRA could be used to promote the ex vivo expansion of Tregs purified from adult human peripheral blood. We found that ATRA helped maintain FOXP3 expression during the expansion process, but this effect was transient and serum-dependent. Furthermore, natural Tregs treated with rapamycin, but not with ATRA, suppressed cytokine production in co-cultured effector T cells. This suppressive activity correlated with the ability of expanded Tregs to induce FOXP3 expression in non-Treg cell populations. Examination of CD45RA+ and CD45RA− Treg subsets revealed that ATRA failed to maintain suppressive activity in either population, but interestingly, Tregs expanded in the presence of both rapamycin and ATRA displayed more suppressive activity and had a more favorable epigenetic status of the FOXP3 gene than Tregs expanded in the presence of rapamycin only. We conclude that while the use of ATRA as a single agent to expand Tregs for human therapy is not warranted, its use in combination with rapamycin may have benefit."
https://openalex.org/W1983319354,"Primordial follicles, providing all the oocytes available to a female throughout her reproductive life, assemble in perinatal ovaries with individual oocytes surrounded by granulosa cells. In mammals including the mouse, most oocytes die by apoptosis during primordial follicle assembly, but factors that regulate oocyte death remain largely unknown. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a key regulator in many essential cellular processes, was shown to be differentially expressed during these processes in mouse ovaries using 2D-PAGE and MALDI-TOF/TOF methodology. A V-shaped expression pattern of PCNA in both oocytes and somatic cells was observed during the development of fetal and neonatal mouse ovaries, decreasing from 13.5 to 18.5 dpc and increasing from 18.5 dpc to 5 dpp. This was closely correlated with the meiotic prophase I progression from pre-leptotene to pachytene and from pachytene to diplotene when primordial follicles started to assemble. Inhibition of the increase of PCNA expression by RNA interference in cultured 18.5 dpc mouse ovaries strikingly reduced the apoptosis of oocytes, accompanied by down-regulation of known pro-apoptotic genes, e.g. Bax, caspase-3, and TNFα and TNFR2, and up-regulation of Bcl-2, a known anti-apoptotic gene. Moreover, reduced expression of PCNA was observed to significantly increase primordial follicle assembly, but these primordial follicles contained fewer granulosa cells. Similar results were obtained after down-regulation by RNA interference of Ing1b, a PCNA-binding protein in the UV-induced apoptosis regulation. Thus, our results demonstrate that PCNA regulates primordial follicle assembly by promoting apoptosis of oocytes in fetal and neonatal mouse ovaries."
https://openalex.org/W2068727204,"Background Multiple mechanisms have been advanced to account for CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cell (Treg)-mediated suppression of CD4+ effector T cells (Teffs) but none appear to completely explain suppression. Previous data indicates that Tregs may affect the microenvironment redox state. Given the inherent redox sensitivity of T cells, we tested the hypothesis that oxidants may mediate the direct suppression of Teffs by Tregs. Methodology/Principal Findings Tregs and Teffs were isolated from the spleens of wild type (WT) C57BL/6 mice or Ncf1(p47phox)-deficient C57BL/6 mice which lack NADPH oxidase function. Teffs were labeled with CFSE and co-cultured with unlabeled Tregs at varying Treg:Teff ratios in the presence of anti-CD3/CD28 coated beads for 3 days in suppression assays. Treg-mediated suppression was quantified by flow cytometric analysis of CFSE dilution in Teffs. The presence of the antioxidants n-acetylcysteine (NAC) or 2-mercaptoethanol or inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenyleneiodonium and VAS-2870) resulted in reduced WT Treg-mediated suppression. The observed suppression was in part dependent upon TGFβ as it was partially blocked with neutralizing antibodies. The suppression of Teff proliferation induced by exogenous TGFβ treatment could be overcome with NAC. Ncf1-deficient Teff were slightly but significantly less sensitive than WT Teff to suppression by exogenous TGFβ. Ncf1-deficient Tregs suppressed Ncf1-deficient Teff very poorly compared to wild type controls. There was partial but incomplete reconstitution of suppression in assays with WT Tregs and Ncf1-deficient Teff. Conclusions/Significance We present evidence that NADPH oxidase derived ROS plays a role in the direct Treg mediated suppression of CD4+ effector T cells in a process that is blocked by thiol-containing antioxidants, NADPH oxidase inhibitors or a lack of Ncf1 expression in Tregs and Teffs. Oxidants may represent a potential new target for therapeutic modulation of Treg function."

However, the majority of attempts to establish ESC lines from large animals, especially ungulate mammals have failed. Recently, another type of pluripotent stem cells, known as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), have been successfully generated from mouse, human, monkey, rat and pig. In this study we show sheep fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to pluripotency by defined factors using a drug-inducible system. Sheep iPSCs derived in this fashion have a normal karyotype, exhibit morphological features similar to those of human ESCs and express AP, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and the cell surface marker SSEA-4. Pluripotency of these cells was further confirmed by embryoid body (EB) and teratoma formation assays which generated derivatives of all three germ layers.

https://openalex.org/W2117027913,"Cigarette smokers and those exposed to second hand smoke are more susceptible to life threatening infection than non-smokers. While much is known about the devastating effect tobacco exposure has on the human body, less is known about the effect of tobacco smoke on the commensal and commonly found pathogenic bacteria of the human respiratory tract, or human respiratory tract microbiome. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common medical complaint, affecting 16% of the US population with an estimated aggregated cost of $6 billion annually. Epidemiologic studies demonstrate a correlation between tobacco smoke exposure and rhinosinusitis. Although a common cause of CRS has not been defined, bacterial presence within the nasal and paranasal sinuses is assumed to be contributory. Here we demonstrate that repetitive tobacco smoke exposure induces biofilm formation in a diverse set of bacteria isolated from the sinonasal cavities of patients with CRS. Additionally, bacteria isolated from patients with tobacco smoke exposure demonstrate robust in vitro biofilm formation when challenged with tobacco smoke compared to those isolated from smoke naïve patients. Lastly, bacteria from smoke exposed patients can revert to a non-biofilm phenotype when grown in the absence of tobacco smoke. These observations support the hypothesis that tobacco exposure induces sinonasal biofilm formation, thereby contributing to the conversion of a transient and medically treatable infection to a persistent and therapeutically recalcitrant condition."

Here, we demonstrate the direct, potent, and reversible inhibition of purified rabbit muscle PFK-1 by low micromolar concentrations of long chain fatty acyl-CoAs (apparent Ki∼1 μM). In sharp contrast, short chain acyl-CoAs, palmitoylcarnitine, and palmitic acid in the presence of CoASH were without effect. Remarkably, MgAMP and MgADP but not MgATP protected PFK-1 against inhibition by palmitoyl-CoA indicating that acyl-CoAs regulate PFK-1 activity in concert with cellular high energy phosphate status. Furthermore, incubation of PFK-1 with [1-(14)C]palmitoyl-CoA resulted in robust acylation of the enzyme that was reversible by incubation with acyl-protein thioesterase-1 (APT1). Importantly, APT1 reversed palmitoyl-CoA-mediated inhibition of PFK-1 activity. Mass spectrometric analyses of palmitoylated PFK-1 revealed four sites of acylation, including Cys-114, Cys-170, Cys-351, and Cys-577. PFK-1 in both skeletal muscle extracts and in purified form was inhibited by S-hexadecyl-CoA, a nonhydrolyzable palmitoyl-CoA analog, demonstrating that covalent acylation of PFK-1 was not required for inhibition. Tryptic footprinting suggested that S-hexadecyl-CoA induced a conformational change in PFK-1. Both palmitoyl-CoA and S-hexadecyl-CoA increased the association of PFK-1 with Ca2+/calmodulin, which attenuated the binding of palmitoylated PFK-1 to membrane vesicles. Collectively, these results demonstrate that fatty acyl-CoA modulates phosphofructokinase activity through both covalent and noncovalent interactions to regulate glycolytic flux and enzyme membrane localization via the branch point metabolic node that mediates lipid flux through anabolic and catabolic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2051068113,"Background The Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is a keystone species in the Antarctic food chain. Not only is it a significant grazer of phytoplankton, but it is also a major food item for charismatic megafauna such as whales and seals and an important Southern Ocean fisheries crop. Ecological data suggest that this species is being affected by climate change and this will have considerable consequences for the balance of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Hence, understanding how this organism functions is a priority area and will provide fundamental data for life history studies, energy budget calculations and food web models. Methodology/Principal Findings The assembly of the 454 transcriptome of E. superba resulted in 22,177 contigs with an average size of 492bp (ranging between 137 and 8515bp). In depth analysis of the data revealed an extensive catalogue of the cellular chaperone systems and the major antioxidant proteins. Full length sequences were characterised for the chaperones HSP70, HSP90 and the super-oxide dismutase antioxidants, with the discovery of potentially novel duplications of these genes. The sequence data contained 41,470 microsatellites and 17,776 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs/INDELS), providing a resource for population and also gene function studies. Conclusions This paper details the first 454 generated data for a pelagic Antarctic species or any pelagic crustacean globally. The classical “stress proteins”, such as HSP70, HSP90, ferritin and GST were all highly expressed. These genes were shown to be over expressed in the transcriptomes of Antarctic notothenioid fish and hypothesized as adaptations to living in the cold, with the associated problems of decreased protein folding efficiency and increased vulnerability to damage by reactive oxygen species. Hence, these data will provide a major resource for future physiological work on krill, but in particular a suite of “stress” genes for studies understanding marine ectotherms' capacities to cope with environmental change."

This is the first time that a lensfree on-chip platform has successfully imaged fluorescent C. elegans samples. In our wide-field lensfree imaging platform, the transgenic samples are excited using a prism interface from the side, where the pump light is rejected through total internal reflection occurring at the bottom facet of the substrate. The emitted fluorescent signal from C. elegans samples is then recorded on a large area opto-electronic sensor-array over an FOV of e.g., >2–8 cm2, without the use of any lenses, thin-film interference filters or mechanical scanners. Because fluorescent emission rapidly diverges, such lensfree fluorescent images recorded on a chip look blurred due to broad point-spread-function of our platform. To combat this resolution challenge, we use a compressive sampling algorithm to uniquely decode the recorded lensfree fluorescent patterns into higher resolution images, demonstrating ∼10 µm resolution. We tested the efficacy of this compressive decoding approach with different types of opto-electronic sensors to achieve a similar resolution level, independent of the imaging chip. We further demonstrate that this wide FOV lensfree fluorescent imaging platform can also perform sequential bright-field imaging of the same samples using partially-coherent lensfree digital in-line holography that is coupled from the top facet of the same prism used in fluorescent excitation. This unique combination permits ultra-wide field dual-mode imaging of C. elegans on a chip which could especially provide a useful tool for high-throughput screening applications in biomedical research."
https://openalex.org/W2036404643,"The neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate acts on the nervous system by modifying neurotransmission and receptor functions, thus influencing synaptic strength, neuronal survival, and neurogenesis. Here we show that pregnenolone sulfate induces a signaling cascade in insulinoma cells leading to enhanced expression of the zinc finger transcription factor Egr-1 and Egr-1-responsive target genes. Pharmacological and genetic experiments revealed that influx of Ca(2+) ions via transient receptor potential M3 and voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels, elevation of the cytosolic Ca(2+) level, and activation of ERK are essential for connecting pregnenolone sulfate stimulation with enhanced Egr-1 biosynthesis. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Elk-1, a key regulator of gene transcription driven by a serum response element, attenuated Egr-1 expression following stimulation, indicating that Elk-1 or related ternary complex factors connect the transcription of the Egr-1 gene with the pregnenolone sulfate-induced intracellular signaling cascade elicited by the initial influx of Ca(2+). The newly synthesized Egr-1 was biologically active and bound under physiological conditions to the regulatory regions of the Pdx-1, Synapsin I, and Chromogranin B genes. Pdx-1 is a major regulator of insulin gene transcription. Accordingly, elevated insulin promoter activity and increased mRNA levels of insulin could be detected in pregnenolone sulfate-stimulated insulinoma cells. Likewise, the biosynthesis of synapsin I, a synaptic vesicle protein that is found at secretory granules in insulinoma cells, was stimulated in pregnenolone sulfate-treated INS-1 cells. Together, these data show that pregnenolone sulfate induces a signaling cascade in insulinoma cells that is very similar to the signaling cascade induced by glucose in β-cells."
https://openalex.org/W2068221656,"Campylobacter jejuni is well known for synthesizing ganglioside mimics within the glycan component of its lipooligosaccharide (LOS), which have been implicated in triggering Guillain-Barré syndrome. We now confirm that this pathogen is capable of synthesizing a much broader spectrum of host glycolipid/glycoprotein mimics within its LOS. P blood group and paragloboside (lacto-N-neotetraose) antigen mimicry is exhibited by RM1221, a strain isolated from a poultry source. RM1503, a gastroenteritis-associated strain, expresses lacto-N-biose and sialyl-Lewis c units, the latter known as the pancreatic tumor-associated antigen, DU-PAN-2 (or LSTa). C. jejuni GC149, a Guillain-Barré syndrome-associated strain, expresses an unusual sialic acid-containing hybrid oligosaccharide with similarity to both ganglio and Pk antigens and can, through phase variation of its LOS biosynthesis genes, display GT1a or GD3 ganglioside mimics. We show that the sialyltransferase CstII and the galactosyltransferase CgtD are involved in the synthesis of multiple mimic types, with LOS structural diversity achieved through evolving allelic substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2144546818,"Deep sequencing of viral or bacterial nucleic acids monitors the presence and diversity of microbes in select populations and locations. Metagenomic study of mammalian viromes can help trace paths of viral transmissions within or between species. High throughput sequencing of patient and untreated sewage microbiomes showed many sequences with no similarity to genomic sequences of known function or origin. To estimate the distribution of functional RNAs in these microbiomes, we used the hammerhead ribozyme (HHR) motif to search for sequences capable of assuming its three-way junction fold. Although only two of the three possible natural HHR topologies had been known, our analysis revealed highly active ribozymes that terminated in any of the three stems. The most abundant of these are type II HHRs, one of which is the fastest natural cis-acting HHR yet discovered. Altogether, 13 ribozymes were confirmed in vitro, but only one showed sequence similarity to previously described HHRs. Sequences surrounding the ribozymes do not generally show similarity to known genes, except in one case, where a ribozyme is immediately preceded by a bacterial RadC gene. We demonstrate that a structure-based search for a known functional RNA is a powerful tool for analysis of metagenomic datasets, complementing sequence alignments."
https://openalex.org/W2120045112,"The neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir are the first-line of defense against potentially fatal variants of influenza A pandemic strains. However, if resistant virus strains start to arise easily or at a high frequency, a new anti-influenza strategy will be necessary. This study aimed to investigate if and to what extent NA inhibitor-resistant mutants exist in the wild population of influenza A viruses that inhabit wild birds. NA sequences of all NA subtypes available from 5490 avian, 379 swine and 122 environmental isolates were extracted from NCBI databases. In addition, a dataset containing 230 virus isolates from mallard collected at Ottenby Bird Observatory (Öland, Sweden) was analyzed. Isolated NA RNA fragments from Ottenby were transformed to cDNA by RT-PCR, which was followed by sequencing. The analysis of genotypic profiles for NAs from both data sets in regard to antiviral resistance mutations was performed using bioinformatics tools. All 6221 sequences were scanned for oseltamivir- (I117V, E119V, D198N, I222V, H274Y, R292K, N294S and I314V) and zanamivir-related mutations (V116A, R118K, E119G/A/D, Q136K, D151E, R152K, R224K, E276D, R292K and R371K). Of the sequences from the avian NCBI dataset, 132 (2.4%) carried at least one, or in two cases even two and three, NA inhibitor resistance mutations. Swine and environmental isolates from the same data set had 18 (4.75%) and one (0.82%) mutant, respectively, with at least one mutation. The Ottenby sequences carried at least one mutation in 15 cases (6.52%). Therefore, resistant strains were more frequently found in Ottenby samples than in NCBI data sets. However, it is still uncertain if these mutations are the result of natural variations in the viruses or if they are induced by the selective pressure of xenobiotics (e.g., oseltamivir, zanamivir)."
https://openalex.org/W1991170256,"Protein concentrations depend not only on the mRNA level, but also on the translation rate and the degradation rate. Prediction of mRNA's translation rate would provide valuable information for in-depth understanding of the translation mechanism and dynamic proteome. In this study, we developed a new computational model to predict the translation rate, featured by (1) integrating various sequence-derived and functional features, (2) applying the maximum relevance & minimum redundancy method and incremental feature selection to select features to optimize the prediction model, and (3) being able to predict the translation rate of RNA into high or low translation rate category. The prediction accuracies under rich and starvation condition were 68.8% and 70.0%, respectively, evaluated by jackknife cross-validation. It was found that the following features were correlated with translation rate: codon usage frequency, some gene ontology enrichment scores, number of RNA binding proteins known to bind its mRNA product, coding sequence length, protein abundance and 5'UTR free energy. These findings might provide useful information for understanding the mechanisms of translation and dynamic proteome. Our translation rate prediction model might become a high throughput tool for annotating the translation rate of mRNAs in large-scale."
https://openalex.org/W2008824701,"Background The ancestry of African-descended Americans is known to be drawn from three distinct populations: African, European, and Native American. While many studies consider this continental admixture, few account for the genetically distinct sources of ancestry within Africa – the continent with the highest genetic variation. Here, we dissect the within-Africa genetic ancestry of various populations of the Americas self-identified as having primarily African ancestry using uniparentally inherited mitochondrial DNA. Methods and Principal Findings We first confirmed that our results obtained using uniparentally-derived group admixture estimates are correlated with the average autosomal-derived individual admixture estimates (hence are relevant to genomic ancestry) by assessing continental admixture using both types of markers (mtDNA and Y-chromosome vs. ancestry informative markers). We then focused on the within-Africa maternal ancestry, mining our comprehensive database of published mtDNA variation (∼5800 individuals from 143 African populations) that helped us thoroughly dissect the African mtDNA pool. Using this well-defined African mtDNA variation, we quantified the relative contributions of maternal genetic ancestry from multiple W/WC/SW/SE (West to South East) African populations to the different pools of today's African-descended Americans of North and South America and the Caribbean. Conclusions Our analysis revealed that both continental admixture and within-Africa admixture may be critical to achieving an adequate understanding of the ancestry of African-descended Americans. While continental ancestry reflects gender-specific admixture processes influenced by different socio-historical practices in the Americas, the within-Africa maternal ancestry reflects the diverse colonial histories of the slave trade. We have confirmed that there is a genetic thread connecting Africa and the Americas, where each colonial system supplied their colonies in the Americas with slaves from African colonies they controlled or that were available for them at the time. This historical connection is reflected in different relative contributions from populations of W/WC/SW/SE Africa to geographically distinct Africa-derived populations of the Americas, adding to the complexity of genomic ancestry in groups ostensibly united by the same demographic label."
https://openalex.org/W2012154132,"Previous work suggests that protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ) is required for long-term memory maintenance. Here, the authors find that, under some conditions, PKMζ inhibition does not erase memory, but only temporarily disrupts the expression of memory. We examined whether protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ) inhibition in the amygdala permanently disrupts fear memory by testing retention at various intervals after PKMζ blockade. Although the expression of fear memory was disrupted when the inhibitor was applied shortly before testing, it had no effect when rats were tested with longer retention intervals. These results suggest that PKMζ inhibition does not erase memory, but temporarily disrupts expression of memory."
https://openalex.org/W2063697659,"The genes boule and dazl are members of the DAZ (Deleted in Azoospermia) family encoding RNA binding proteins essential for germ cell development. Although dazl exhibits bisexual expression in mitotic and meiotic germ cells in diverse animals, boule shows unisexual meiotic expression in invertebrates and mammals but a bisexual mitotic and meiotic expression in medaka. How boule and dazl have evolved different expression patterns in diverse organisms has remained unknown.Here we chose the fish rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as a second lower vertebrate model to investigate the expression of boule and dazl. By molecular cloning and sequence comparison, we identified cDNAs encoding the trout Boule and Dazl proteins, which have a conserved RNA-recognition motif and a maximal similarity to their homologs. By RT-PCR analysis, adult RNA expression of trout boule and dazl is restricted to the gonads of both sexes. By chromogenic and two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization, we revealed bisexual and germline-specific expression of boule and dazl. We found that dazl displays conserved expression throughout gametogenesis and concentrates in the Balbinani's body of early oocytes and the chromatoid body of sperm. Surprisingly, boule exhibits mitotic and meiotic expression in the male but meiosis-specific expression in the female.Our data underscores differential conservation and divergence of DAZ family genes during vertebrate evolution. We propose a model in which the diversity of boule expression in sex and stage specificity might have resulted from selective loss or gain of its expression in one sex and mitotic germ cells."
https://openalex.org/W1980096472,"Haplogroup E1b1, defined by the marker P2, is the most represented human Y chromosome haplogroup in Africa. A phylogenetic tree showing the internal structure of this haplogroup was published in 2008. A high degree of internal diversity characterizes this haplogroup, as well as the presence of a set of chromosomes undefined on the basis of a derived character. Here we make an effort to update the phylogeny of this highly diverse haplogroup by including seven mutations which have been newly discovered by direct resequencing. We also try to incorporate five previously-described markers which were not, however, reported in the 2008 tree. Additionally, during the process of mapping, we found that two previously reported SNPs required a new position on the tree. There are three key changes compared to the 2008 phylogeny. Firstly, haplogroup E-M2 (former E1b1a) and haplogroup E-M329 (former E1b1c) are now united by the mutations V38 and V100, reducing the number of E1b1 basal branches to two. The new topology of the tree has important implications concerning the origin of haplogroup E1b1. Secondly, within E1b1b1 (E-M35), two haplogroups (E-V68 and E-V257) show similar phylogenetic and geographic structure, pointing to a genetic bridge between southern European and northern African Y chromosomes. Thirdly, most of the E1b1b1* (E-M35*) paragroup chromosomes are now marked by defining mutations, thus increasing the discriminative power of the haplogroup for use in human evolution and forensics."
https://openalex.org/W1963733835,"Human tissue inflammation is terminated, at least in part, by the death of inflammatory neutrophils by apoptosis. The regulation of this process is therefore key to understanding and manipulating inflammation resolution. Previous data have suggested that the short-lived pro-survival Bcl-2 family protein, Mcl-1, is instrumental in determining neutrophil lifespan. However, Mcl-1 can be cleaved following caspase activity, and the possibility therefore remains that the observed fall in Mcl-1 levels is due to caspase activity downstream of caspase activation, rather than being a key event initiating apoptosis in human neutrophils. We demonstrate that apoptosis in highly purified neutrophils can be almost completely abrogated by caspase inhibition with the highly effective di-peptide caspase inhibitor, Q-VD.OPh, confirming the caspase dependence of neutrophil apoptosis. Effective caspase inhibition does not prevent the observed fall in Mcl-1 levels early in ultrapure neutrophil culture, suggesting that this fall in Mcl-1 levels is not a consequence of neutrophil apoptosis. However, at later timepoints, declines in Mcl-1 can be reversed with effective caspase inhibition, suggesting that Mcl-1 is both an upstream regulator and a downstream target of caspase activity in human neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1979591640,"We have incorporated, for the first time, FtsZ and FtsA (the soluble proto-ring proteins from Escherichia coli) into bacterial giant unilamellar inner membrane vesicles (GUIMVs). Inside the vesicles, the structural organization and spatial distribution of fluorescently labeled FtsZ and FtsA were determined by confocal microscopy. We found that, in the presence of GDP, FtsZ was homogeneously distributed in the lumen of the vesicle. In the presence of GTP analogs, FtsZ assembled inside the GUIMVs, forming a web of dense spots and fibers. Whereas isolated FtsA was found adsorbed to the inner face of GUIMVs, the addition of FtsZ together with GTP analogs resulted in its dislodgement and its association with the FtsZ fibers in the lumen, suggesting that the FtsA-membrane interaction can be modulated by FtsZ polymers. The use of this novel in vitro system to probe interactions between divisome components will help to determine the biological implications of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W1976113829,"Background Little is known about the time to sputum culture conversion in MDR-TB patients co-infected with HIV, although such patients have, historically, had poor outcomes. We describe culture conversion rates among MDR-TB patients with and without HIV-co-infection in a TB-endemic, high-HIV prevalent, resource-limited setting. Methods Patients with culture-proven MDR-TB were treated with a standardized second-line regimen. Sputum cultures were taken monthly and conversion was defined as two negative cultures taken at least one month apart. Time-to-conversion was measured from the day of initiation of MDR-TB therapy. Subjects with HIV received antiretroviral therapy (ART) regardless of CD4 count. Results Among 45 MDR-TB patients, 36 (80%) were HIV-co-infected. Overall, 40 (89%) of the 45 patients culture-converted within the first six months and there was no difference in the proportion who converted based on HIV status. Median time-to-conversion was 62 days (IQR 48-111). Among the five patients who did not culture convert, three died, one was transferred to another facility, and one refused further treatment before completing 6 months of therapy. Thus, no patients remained persistently culture-positive at 6 months of therapy. Conclusions With concurrent second-line TB and ART medications, MDR-TB/HIV co-infected patients can achieve culture conversion rates and times similar to those reported from HIV-negative patients worldwide. Future studies are needed to examine whether similar cure rates are achieved at the end of MDR-TB treatment and to determine the optimal use and timing of ART in the setting of MDR-TB treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2128841125,"Besides the multifunctionality, another equally important aspect of nanoparticles is their engineerability to control the geometrical and chemical properties during fabrication. In this work, we exploited this aspect to define asymmetric surface chemistry of an iron oxide nanosphere by controlling the topology of ligand expression on its surface resulting in a particle with two faces, one displaying only amines and the other only thiols. Specifically, amine-functionalized iron oxide nanospheres were attached on a solid support via a crosslinker containing a disulfide bridge. Liberation of the nanosphere using thiolytic cleavage created thiols on the portion of the particle's surface that interacted with the solid support. Employing a solid-phase strategy and a step-by-step addition of particles, the two unique faces on the same nanosphere served as fittings to assemble them into linear nano-chains. Assembly of chains with various lengths and aspect ratios was controlled by the size and number of the added nanospheres. The characteristics of those chains showed a high degree of uniformity indicating the exceptional control of the synthetic process. Notably, one of the unique properties of the iron oxide nano-chains was an increased magnetic relaxivity, indicating their potential use as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging."
https://openalex.org/W1993708257,"Wild birds in the Orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes are the natural reservoirs for avian influenza (AI) viruses. Although they are often infected with multiple AI viruses, the significance and extent of acquired immunity in these populations is not understood. Pre-existing immunity to AI virus has been shown to modulate the outcome of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus infection in multiple domestic avian species, but few studies have addressed this effect in wild birds. In this study, the effect of pre-exposure to homosubtypic (homologous hemagglutinin) and heterosubtypic (heterologous hemagglutinin) low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses on the outcome of a H5N1 HPAI virus infection in wood ducks (Aix sponsa) was evaluated. Pre-exposure of wood ducks to different LPAI viruses did not prevent infection with H5N1 HPAI virus, but did increase survival associated with H5N1 HPAI virus infection. The magnitude of this effect on the outcome of the H5N1 HPAI virus infection varied between different LPAI viruses, and was associated both with efficiency of LPAI viral replication in wood ducks and the development of a detectable humoral immune response. These observations suggest that in naturally occurring outbreaks of H5N1 HPAI, birds with pre-existing immunity to homologous hemagglutinin or neuraminidase subtypes of AI virus may either survive H5N1 HPAI virus infection or live longer than naïve birds and, consequently, could pose a greater risk for contributing to viral transmission and dissemination. The mechanisms responsible for this protection and/or the duration of this immunity remain unknown. The results of this study are important for surveillance efforts and help clarify epidemiological data from outbreaks of H5N1 HPAI virus in wild bird populations."
https://openalex.org/W2012271534,"ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a membrane-bound protein that regulates the efflux of cholesterol derived from internalized lipoproteins. Using a mouse macrophage cell line, this report studied the impact of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) on ABCA1 expression and the signaling pathway responsible for lipoprotein-induced ABCA1 expression. Our data demonstrated that treatment of macrophages with LDL increased ABCA1 mRNA and protein levels 4.3- and 3.5-fold, respectively. LDL also induced an ∼2-fold increase in macrophage surface expression of ABCA1 and a 14-fold-increase in apolipoprotein AI-mediated cholesterol efflux. In addition, LDL significantly increased the level of phosphorylated specificity protein 1 (Sp1) and the amount of Sp1 bound to the ABCA1 promoter without alteration in total Sp1 protein level. Mutation of the Sp1 binding site in the ABCA1 promoter and inhibition of Sp1 DNA binding with mithramycin A suppressed the ABCA1 promoter activity and reduced the ABCA1 expression level induced by LDL. LDL treatment also elevated protein kinase C-ζ (PKC-ζ) phosphorylation and induced PKC-ζ binding with Sp1. Inhibition of PKC-ζ with kinase inhibitors or overexpression of kinase-dead PKC-ζ attenuated Sp1 phosphorylation and ABCA1 expression induced by LDL. These results demonstrate for the first time that activation of the PKCζ-Sp1 signaling cascade is a mechanism for regulation of LDL-induced ABCA1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1992295816,"Background Over-activity and elevated expression of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) has been implicated in the etiology of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Administration of specific GSK-3 inhibitors to diabetic or obese rodent models improves glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity. However, due to the indiscriminatory nature of these inhibitors, the relative contribution of the two isoforms of GSK-3 (GSK-3α and GSK-3β) is not known. Recently, we demonstrated that an out-bred strain of mice (ICR) lacking expression of GSK-3α in all tissues displayed improved insulin sensitivity and enhanced hepatic glucose metabolism. We also found that muscle (but not liver) inactivation of GSK-3β conferred insulin and glucose sensitization in an in-bred strain of mice (C57BL/6). Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we have employed tissue-specific deletion of GSK-3α, to examine the relative contribution of two insulin-sensitive tissues, muscle and liver, towards the insulin sensitization phenotype originally observed in the global GSK-3α KO animals. We found that mice in which GSK-3α has been inactivated in either skeletal-muscle or liver displayed no differences in glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity compared to wild type littermates. Given the strain differences in our original analyses, we examined the insulin and glucose sensitivity of global GSK-3α KO animals bred onto a C57BL/6 background. These animals also revealed no significant differences in glucose metabolism/insulin sensitivity compared to their wild type littermates. Furthermore, deletion of hepatic GSK-3α on the out-bred, ICR background failed to reproduce the insulin sensitivity manifested by the global deletion of this isoform. Conclusions/Significance From these data we conclude that the improved insulin sensitivity and hepatic glucose homeostasis phenotype observed upon global inactivation of GSK-3α is strain-specific. We surmise that the insulin-sensitization observed in the out-bred strain of mice lacking GSK-3α is mediated by indirect means that do not require intrinsic function of GSK-3α in skeletal muscle and liver tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2015588180,"Ras proteins are crucial players in differentiation and oncogenesis and constitute important drug targets. The localization and activity of Ras proteins are highly dependent on posttranslational modifications at their C-termini. In addition to an isoprenylated cysteine, H-Ras, but not other Ras proteins, possesses two cysteine residues (C181 and C184) in the C-terminal hypervariable domain that act as palmitoylation sites in cells. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins (cyPG) are reactive lipidic mediators that covalently bind to H-Ras and activate H-Ras dependent pathways. Dienone cyPG, such as 15-deoxy-Δ(12,14)-PGJ(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) and Δ(12)-PGJ(2) selectively bind to the H-Ras hypervariable domain. Here we show that these cyPG bind simultaneously C181 and C184 of H-Ras, thus potentially altering the conformational tendencies of the hypervariable domain. Based on these results, we have explored the capacity of several bifunctional cysteine reactive small molecules to bind to the hypervariable domain of H-Ras proteins. Interestingly, phenylarsine oxide (PAO), a widely used tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, and dibromobimane, a cross-linking agent used for cysteine mapping, effectively bind H-Ras hypervariable domain. The interaction of PAO with H-Ras takes place in vitro and in cells and blocks modification of H-Ras by 15d-PGJ(2). Moreover, PAO treatment selectively alters H-Ras membrane partition and the pattern of H-Ras activation in cells, from the plasma membrane to endomembranes. These results identify H-Ras as a novel target for PAO. More importantly, these observations reveal that small molecules or reactive intermediates interacting with spatially vicinal cysteines induce intramolecular cross-linking of H-Ras C-terminus potentially contributing to the modulation of Ras-dependent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2075291231,"Yin-Yang 1 (YY1) is an essential multifunctional zinc-finger protein. It has been shown over the past two decades to be a critical regulator of a vast array of biological processes, including development, cell proliferation and differentiation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. YY1 exerts its functions primarily as a transcription factor that can activate or repress gene expression, dependent on its spatial and temporal context. YY1 regulates a large number of genes involved in cell cycle transitions, many of which are oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. YY1 itself has been classified as an oncogene and was found to be upregulated in many cancer types. Unfortunately, our knowledge of what regulates YY1 is very minimal. Although YY1 has been shown to be a phosphoprotein, no kinase has ever been identified for the phosphorylation of YY1. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) has emerged in the past few years as a major cell cycle regulator, particularly for cell division. Plk1 has been shown to play important roles in the G/M transition into mitosis and for the proper execution of cytokinesis, processes that YY1 has been shown to regulate also. Here, we present evidence that Plk1 directly phosphorylates YY1 in vitro and in vivo at threonine 39 in the activation domain. We show that this phosphorylation is cell cycle regulated and peaks at G2/M. This is the first report identifying a kinase for which YY1 is a substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2101837112,"Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) plays an important role in the cellular response to proteotoxic stresses. Under normal growth conditions HSF1 is repressed as an inactive monomer in part through post-translation modifications that include protein acetylation, sumoylation and phosphorylation. Upon exposure to stress HSF1 homotrimerizes, accumulates in nucleus, binds DNA, becomes hyper-phosphorylated and activates the expression of stress response genes. While HSF1 and the mechanisms that regulate its activity have been studied for over two decades, our understanding of HSF1 regulation remains incomplete. As previous studies have shown that HSF1 and the heat shock response promoter element (HSE) are generally structurally conserved from yeast to metazoans, we have made use of the genetically tractable budding yeast as a facile assay system to further understand the mechanisms that regulate human HSF1 through phosphorylation of serine 303. We show that when human HSF1 is expressed in yeast its phosphorylation at S303 is promoted by the MAP-kinase Slt2 independent of a priming event at S307 previously believed to be a prerequisite. Furthermore, we show that phosphorylation at S303 in yeast and mammalian cells occurs independent of GSK3, the kinase primarily thought to be responsible for S303 phosphorylation. Lastly, while previous studies have suggested that S303 phosphorylation represses HSF1-dependent transactivation, we now show that S303 phosphorylation also represses HSF1 multimerization in both yeast and mammalian cells. Taken together, these studies suggest that yeast cells will be a powerful experimental tool for deciphering aspects of human HSF1 regulation by post-translational modifications."

FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain is characterized by extensive co- and post-translational modifications, including two N-linked glycans with complex structure, a disulfide bridge, and a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (reviewed in Ref. 13Tatzelt J. Winklhofer K.F. Amyloid. 2004; 11: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the octarepeat region in the N-terminal domain as well as the C-terminal GPI anchor are dispensable for the generation of infectious prions (8Chesebro B. Trifilo M. Race R.

Although in the majority of prion diseases there is a correlation between the accumulation of PrPSc, formation of infectious prions, and neurodegeneration, there are some interesting exceptions. Transgenic mouse models revealed that several PrP mutants can induce neuronal cell death in the absence of infectious prion propagation (reviewed in Ref. 16Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. Haass C. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 336-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). From one class of PrP mutants, it emerged that PrPC can acquire a neurotoxic potential by deleting the internal HD (17Shmerling D. Hegyi I. Fischer M. Blättler T. Brandner S. Götz J. Rülicke T.

Chiesa R. Harris D.A. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 548-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Similarly to PrPC, PrPΔHD is complex glycosylated and linked to the plasma membrane via a GPI anchor (20Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranyi W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of PrPC can completely prevent the neurotoxic activity of PrPΔHD, suggesting that PrPC and PrPΔHD can induce neuroprotective or neurotoxic signaling via binding to the same signal-transducing protein(s) (9Rambold A.S.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 548-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Indeed, numerous studies in transgenic animals and cultured cells are now supporting the idea that the physiological role of PrPC is to protect neuronal cells against stress-induced cell death (reviewed in Ref. 21Westergard L. Christensen H.M. Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1772: 629-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In the search for homologs/paralogs of PrPC, a new gene was identified termed Sprn, encoding for a protein denoted Shadoo (Sho) (22Premzl M. Sangiorgio L. Strumbo B. Marshall Graves J.A. Simonic T. Gready J.E. Gene. 2003; 314: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Sho is highly conserved from fish to mammals. The sequence homology between Sho and PrP is restricted to the internal hydrophobic domain; however, certain features, such as a N-terminal repeat region and a C-terminal GPI anchor, are conserved, suggesting that Sho and PrP may be functionally related. Experimental evidence for the post-translational modifications and cell surface localization of Sho was first presented for zebrafish Sho (23Miesbauer M. Bamme T. Riemer C. Oidtmann B. Winklhofer K.F. Baier M. Tatzelt J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and afterward also for mouse Sho (24Watts J.C. Drisaldi B. Ng V. Yang J. Strome B. Horne P. Sy M.S. Yoong L. Young R. Mastrangelo P. Bergeron C. Fraser P.E. Carlson G.A. Mount H.T. Schmitt-Ulms G. Westaway D. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4038-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was demonstrated that Sho, similarly to PrPC, can prevent neuronal cell death induced by the expression of PrPΔHD mutants (24Watts J.C. Drisaldi B. Ng V. Yang J. Strome B. Horne P. Sy M.S. Yoong L. Young R. Mastrangelo P. Bergeron C. Fraser P.E. Carlson G.A. Mount H.T. Schmitt-Ulms G. Westaway D. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4038-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the stress-protective activity of Sho in detail and defined domains required for this activity. Furthermore, the generation of a N-Sho·PrP-C chimeric protein revealed that the N terminus of Sho can restore the stress-protective activity of a PrP mutant devoid of the N-terminal domain (PrPΔN). All standard chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma if not otherwise noted. The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-PrP 3F4 antibody (25Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mouse monoclonal anti-V5 tag antibody (Invitrogen), mouse monoclonal anti-HA tag antibody (Covance), anti-active caspase-3 polyclonal antibody (Promega), Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Dianova), and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Dianova). For the generation of a rabbit polyclonal anti-Sho antibody, recombinant human full-length Sho, expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli, was used for the immunization of rabbits (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). The mounting medium Mowiol (Calbiochem) was supplemented with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The cloning of PrP, PrPΔN (Δ28–89), PrPΔHD (Δ113–133), and PrPS131C was described previously (20Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranyi W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol.

The human Sho gene was prepared by ligation-based strategy for chemical gene synthesis using the Sloning building block technology (28Van den Brulle J. Fischer M. Langmann T. Horn G. Waldmann T. Arnold S. Fuhrmann M. Schatz O. O'Connell T. O'Connell D. Auckenthaler A. Schwer H. BioTechniques. 2008; 45: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Sloning, Puchheim, Germany) and cloned into a pcDNA 3.1/Zeo (+). A V5 tag (5′-GGT AAA CCG ATA CCG AAC CCG CTC CTC GGT CTC GAT TCG ACG-3′) or HA tag (5′-TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT-3′) was inserted between amino acids 124 and 125. Sho was used as a template to introduce the following deletions and mutations by standard PCR cloning techniques: ShoΔN (aa 30–56 deleted), ShoΔHD (aa 68–89 deleted), ShoS87C (serine at aa 87 replaced with cysteine), and ShoΔN,S87C (aa 30–56 deleted; serine at aa 87 replaced with cysteine). All amino acid numbers refer to the human Shadoo sequence (GenBankTM association number NM_001012508). The chimeric N-Sho·PrP-C (Sho 1–63 and PrP 89–254) was generated by PCR and cloned into pcDNA 3.1/Zeo (+) vector. Human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) were cultured as described earlier (20Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranyi W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cultured cells were transfected with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 24 h, cells were washed with cold PBS, scraped off the plate, pelleted, and lysed in cold detergent buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in PBS). Endo H (New England Biolabs) and PNGase F (Roche Applied Science) digestions were done according to the manufacturer's instruction. To inhibit N-linked glycosylation or transport to the plasma membrane, transfected cells were grown in the presence of tunicamycin (0.5 μg/ml) or brefeldin A (1 μg/ml), respectively. 24 h later, cells were analyzed. For phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) treatment, cells were washed twice with cold PBS. PIPLC (1 units/ml) was added to the cells for 3 h at 4 °C. The medium was collected, and cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in cold detergent buffer. Proteins present in the medium were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid (TCA), boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting as described earlier (29Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As described earlier (27Rambold A.S. Miesbauer M. Rapaport D. Bartke T. Baier M. Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3356-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), SH-SY5Y cells were grown on coverslips. 24 h after transfection, the cells were incubated with glutamate (500 μm) for 3 h. The cells were then fixed, and activated caspase-3 was detected by indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-active caspase-3 antibody. To detect cells undergoing apoptosis, the number of activated caspase-3-positive cells out of at least 1100 transfected cells was determined using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Quantifications were based on triplicates of at least three independent experiments. To analyze formation of a mixed PrP/Sho dimer, SH-SY5Y cells were co-transfected with PrPS131C and ShoS87C. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed in ice-cold detergent lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in PBS) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Precleared lysates were incubated with αV5 antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads and analyzed by Western blotting. To analyze formation of Sho trans-dimers, separate dishes of SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with either ShoS87C-V5 or ShoS87C-HA. 3 h after transfection, cells were extensively washed, trypsinized, mixed together, and seeded in one cell culture dish. 24 h later, the cells were harvested and analyzed as described above. Transiently transfected SH-SY5Y cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed 24 h after transfection with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Fixed cells were incubated with primary antibody for 45 min at 37 °C in PBS containing 1% BSA. After extensive washing with cold PBS, incubation with the Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody followed at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were mounted onto glass slides and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Data were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was carried out using Student's t test. p values are as follows: *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.005, ***, p <0.0005. In a previous study, we have shown that zebrafish Sho expressed in mammalian cells is a complex glycosylated, GPI-anchored protein present at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (23Miesbauer M. Bamme T. Riemer C. Oidtmann B. Winklhofer K.F. Baier M. Tatzelt J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For a functional characterization of mammalian Sho, we cloned the human homolog and several mutants as outlined in Fig. 1A. The design of the Sho mutants was based on PrP mutants that have been characterized previously. PrPΔN, a mutant lacking large parts of the intrinsically disordered N terminus (Δaa 27–89), can promote propagation of infectious prions (14Fischer M. Rülicke T. Raeber A. Sailer A. Moser M. Oesch B. Brandner S. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) but shows an impaired neuroprotective activity (9Rambold A.S. Müller V. Ron U. Ben-Tal N.

Kretzschmar H.A. Brain Pathol. 2007; 17: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). PrPΔHD lacks the highly conserved internal hydrophobic domain (Δaa 113–133) and is characterized by a neurotoxic potential that can be blocked by the co-expression of wild type (WT) PrPC (9Rambold A.S. Müller V. Ron U. Ben-Tal N. Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1974-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Shmerling D. Hegyi I. Fischer M. Blättler T. Brandner S. Götz J.

Roth K.A. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 548-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Importantly, these PrP mutants are complex glycosylated and targeted to the outer surface of the plasma membrane via a GPI anchor (20Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranyi W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). First, we expressed the different Sho constructs and the corresponding PrP mutants in human SH-SY5Y cells to analyze the co- and post-translational modifications. To evaluate the modification with N-linked glycans, cell lysates were treated with PNGase F to remove all N-linked glycans. The apparent shift in electrophoretic mobility after PNGase F digestion indicated that all constructs are modified with N-linked glycans (Fig. 1C). The glycans were resistant to Endo H digestion (data not shown), indicating that all constructs are modified with N-linked glycans of complex structure. To test for a C-terminal GPI anchor, live cells were incubated with PIPLC to release GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface. Indeed, after PIPLC treatment, the relative amount of the PrP constructs in the cell lysates decreased concomitantly with the appearance of the respective proteins in the cell culture supernatant (Fig. 2A). Similarly, PIPLC treatment reduced the relative amount of the Sho constructs present in the cell lysates. In parallel, Sho and ShoΔN were found in the supernatant of PIPLC-treated cells (Fig. 2A). Curiously, we never detected significant amounts of ShoΔHD in the cell culture medium after PIPLC treatment, using neither the V5 nor our newly generated polyclonal anti-Sho antisera. So far, we have not been able to unravel the underlying mechanisms for this phenomenon. However, when we performed indirect immunofluorescence of non-permeabilized cells, we were able to demonstrate localization of all constructs, including ShoΔHD, at the outer surface of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). In sum, these data revealed that wild type Sho as well as Sho mutants devoid of the N-terminal domain or the internal HD are complex glycosylated and tethered to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane via a GPI anchor. To evaluate the stress-protective capacity of Sho, we employed two different stress paradigms, exposition of cells to the excitotoxin glutamate and expression of the neurotoxic PrP mutant PrPΔHD. To identify cells undergoing apoptosis, transiently transfected SH-SY5Y cells were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence using an antibody specific for activated caspase-3. Please note that SH-SY5Y cells are characterized by low levels of endogenous PrPC (Fig. 3A, right panel, pcDNA, 3F4). Consistent with previous findings (9Rambold A.S. Müller V. Ron U. Ben-Tal N. Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1974-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), PrPC was able to protect cells against excitotoxic cell death, whereas the deletion of the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain lead to a loss of this activity (Fig. 3A). Similarly to PrPC, full-length Sho displayed a stress-protective capacity, which was abolished by the deletion of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 3A). These findings indicate that deletion of the N-terminal domain of PrP or Sho had similar consequences. However, deletion of the internal HD had distinct effects. As previously documented in transgenic mice and cell culture models (9Rambold A.S. Müller V. Ron U. Ben-Tal N. Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1974-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Shmerling D. Hegyi I. Fischer M. Blättler T. Brandner S. Götz J. Rülicke T. Flechsig E. Cozzio A. von Mering C. Hangartner C.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 548-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), PrPΔHD acquires a toxic activity (Fig. 3A). ShoΔHD lost its stress-protective activity; however, in contrast to PrPΔHD it did not induce cell death (Fig. 3A). In the next step, we employed expression of PrPΔHD as a toxic insult. As expected from previous studies, toxic effects of PrPΔHD expression were alleviated by the co-expression of PrPC (Fig. 3B). Corroborating earlier results with primary neurons (24Watts J.C. Drisaldi B. Ng V. Yang J. Strome B. Horne P. Sy M.S. Yoong L. Young R. Mastrangelo P. Bergeron C. Fraser P.E. Carlson G.A. Mount H.T. Schmitt-Ulms G. Westaway D. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4038-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), Sho was also able to suppress toxicity induced by PrPΔHD (Fig. 3B). However, neither PrPΔN nor ShoΔN prevented apoptosis in cells expressing PrPΔHD. Similarly, ShoΔHD could not interfere with the toxic effects of PrPΔHD (Fig. 3B). In a previous study, we could show that the HD mediates dimerization of PrPC and is part of the dimer interface (9Rambold A.S. Müller V. Ron U. Ben-Tal N. Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1974-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because the HDs of Sho and PrP are highly homologous (44.4%, Fig. 1B), we tested whether the HD of Sho has a similar activity. To stabilize a possible Sho dimer, we replaced serine 87 with cysteine (Fig. 4A). In case the HD is part of a dimer interface, cysteine 87 could form an intermolecular disulfide bond, which is stable in SDS buffers under non-reducing conditions. Thus, dimer formation can be analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting by preparing protein lysates with sample buffer devoid of reducing agents, such as 2-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) or dithiothreitol (DTT). SH-SY5Y cells were transiently transfected with ShoS87C. As a control, PrPS131C was analyzed in parallel. Protein lysates were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer with or without 2-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by Western blotting. In line with earlier results, PrP dimers were detected in lysates prepared from PrPS131C-expressing SH-SY5Y cells when reducing agents were omitted from the sample buffer (Fig. 4B). Similarly, in extracts from cells expressing ShoS87C, a slower migrating species appeared with a molecular mass indicative of a Sho dimer (Fig. 4B). In the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, the migration pattern of ShoS87C was identical to that of wild type Sho, indicating that the introduced cysteine residue has induced the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond. To assess the role of the N-terminal domain in dimer formation, we deleted residues 30–56. As shown in Fig. 4C, ShoΔN,S87C formed dimers similarly to ShoS87C. Treatment of cell lysates with Endo H or PNGase F revealed that ShoS87C is modified with N-linked glycans of complex structure, similarly to wild type Sho (Fig. 4D). In addition, both ShoS87C and PrPS131C were released from the cell surface of live cells after incubation with PIPLC, revealing the presence of a C-terminal GPI anchor (Fig. 4E). Next we tested whether dimer formation required N-linked glycosylation and occurs during transit through the secretory pathway. Transiently transfected cells expressing either PrPS131C or ShoS87C were cultivated in the presence of tunicamycin or brefeldin A, and dimer formation was analyzed by Western blotting. Indeed, homodimers of PrP or Sho could be detected under both conditions (Fig. 5A). These data indicated that dimer formation can obviously occur as soon as the proteins enter the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. However, we also addressed the possibility that dimer formation occurs in trans at the plasma membrane between Sho molecules located on adjacent cells. For this purpose, we generated a ShoS87C construct with a C-terminal HA tag instead of the V5 tag. Separately transfected cells expressing either ShoS87C-V5 or ShoS87C-HA were mixed and co-cultivated for an additional 24 h. The density was chosen to allow cell-cell contact. The co-immunoprecipitation analysis did not indicate the formation of trans-dimers (Fig. 5B). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Sho trans-dimers can form in vivo under certain conditions. The HDs of Sho and PrP are highly similar; thus, we analyzed whether they might promote formation of a mixed PrP/Sho dimer. Transiently transfected cells expressing both PrPS131C and ShoS87C were lysed, and Sho immunopurified with the V5 antibody. The immunopellet was then analyzed by Western blotting. Sho homodimers were efficiently detected with this approach; however, we were not able to show the formation of mixed PrP/Sho dimers (Fig. 5C). The functional characterization of Sho mutants presented above revealed a critical role of the N-terminal domain for the stress-protective activity of Sho. Similarly, PrPΔN lacks a stress-protective activity in cell culture and animal models (Fig. 3) (9Rambold A.S. Müller V. Ron U. Ben-Tal N. Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1974-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Mitteregger G. Vosko M. Krebs B. Xiang W. Kohlmannsperger V. Nölting S. Hamann G.F. Kretzschmar H.A. Brain Pathol. 2007; 17: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To test for the intriguing possibility of a conserved function of the N-terminal domains of PrPC and Sho, we fused the N-terminal domain of Sho to PrPΔN (Fig. 6A). Expression and post-translational modifications of N-Sho·PrP-C were similar to that of wild type PrP or wild type Sho; the chimeric protein was complex glycosylated and tethered to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane via a GPI anchor (Fig. 6, B and C). We then compared the stress-protective activity of N-Sho·PrP-C to that of PrPΔN. As described above, we used two different toxic conditions: 1) expression of the neurotoxic PrP mutant PrPΔHD and 2) treatment of cells with the excitotoxin glutamate. Indeed, these experiments revealed that the N-terminal domain of Sho can restore the stress-protective capacity of PrPΔN. Similarly to full-length Sho or full-length PrP, N-Sho·PrP-C interfered with apoptotic cell death of SH-SY5Y cells expressing PrPΔHD (Fig. 6D) or exposed to glutamate (Fig. 6E). Sho is a highly conserved protein found from fish to humans. Although it has no overall sequence homology to PrP, both proteins contain a conserved internal hydrophobic domain and a C-terminal GPI anchor, two elements important for physiological and toxic activities of PrP. Our study presents experimental evidence that Sho and PrP are characterized by a conserved activity to protect cells against stress-induced cell death and suggests that both proteins might act on similar signaling pathways. The first finding of our study was that the stress-protective activity of Sho is not restricted to counteracting the toxic effects of PrPΔHD, an artificial PrP mutant devoid of the internal HD. We employed glutamate as a physiologically relevant stressor to show that Sho can efficiently protect cells against excitotoxin-induced cell death. Deletion mutants revealed that the stress-protective activity of Sho and PrP seems to be dependent on similar domains, in particular the N-terminal and the internal HD. ShoΔN and ShoΔHD displayed a reduced stress-protective activity but are complex glycosylated and attached to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane via a GPI anchor, indicating that the impaired activity is not due to incorrect cellular trafficking. What could be the role of the N-terminal domain and the internal HD in promoting protective signaling? The N-terminal domain of PrP is intrinsically disordered, and it has been shown that intrinsically disordered domains are often involved in protein-protein interactions (30Tompa P. Fuxreiter M. Oldfield C.J. Simon I. Dunker A.K. Uversky V.N. Bioessays. 2009; 31: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus, it would be an attractive idea to assume that the N-terminal domains of PrPC and Sho mediate interaction with a yet unknown co-receptor required for intracellular signal transmission. Interestingly, a circular dichroism analysis of recombinant Sho indicated that the whole protein might be unstructured (24Watts J.C. Drisaldi B. Ng V. Yang J. Strome B. Horne P. Sy M.S. Yoong L. Young R. Mastrangelo P. Bergeron C. Fraser P.E. Carlson G.A. Mount H.T. Schmitt-Ulms G. Westaway D. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4038-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The HD is the only domain with significant sequence homologies between Sho and PrPC. Indeed, the HD promoted dimerization of both Sho and PrPC and was part of the dimer interface. In this context, it is worth mentioning that dimerization is a common feature of many cell surface receptors; therefore, it can be speculated that dimer formation is involved in signal transmission of PrPC- and Sho-dependent pathways. Notably, formation of both PrP and Sho homodimers is not dependent on N-linked glycosylation and already occurs during transit through the secretory pathway. Similarly, PrP and Sho mutants devoid of the N-terminal domain are still capable of forming homodimers;, however, they have an impaired stress-protective activity. Studies in transgenic mice revealed the unexpected finding that PrP can acquire a neurotoxic potential simply by deleting the internal hydrophobic domain (17Shmerling D. Hegyi I. Fischer M. Blättler T. Brandner S. Götz J. Rülicke T. Flechsig E. Cozzio A. von Mering C. Hangartner C. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C.

Importantly, the neurotoxic potential of PrPΔHD is independent of the propagation of infectious prions, a phenomenon also seen for other neurotoxic PrP mutants (reviewed in Ref. 16Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. Haass C. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 336-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Although the underlying mechanisms of PrPΔHD-induced toxicity are still elusive, co-expression of wild type PrPC completely prevents toxic effects of PrPΔHD. Based on this intriguing observation, it has been hypothesized that the stress-protective signaling of PrPC and the neurotoxic signaling of PrPΔHD are transmitted through a common co-receptor, which remains to be identified (9Rambold A.S.

Interestingly, co-transfection experiments with PrP-deficient cerebellar granule neurons indicated that Sho has a PrPC-like activity to alleviate toxic effects of PrPΔHD expression (24Watts J.C. Drisaldi B. Ng V. Yang J. Strome B. Horne P. Sy M.S. Yoong L. Young R. Mastrangelo P. Bergeron C. Fraser P.E. Carlson G.A. Mount H.T. Schmitt-Ulms G. Westaway D. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4038-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have been able to recapitulate the toxic activity of PrPΔHD expression in our cell culture model and to demonstrate the protective activity of PrP and Sho against PrPΔHD-induced toxicity. In addition, we could show that ShoΔHD lost its ability to protect against stress-induced cell death; however, ShoΔHD did not acquire a toxic activity, at least not under the experimental conditions tested. Thus, it appears that Sho and PrP share a stress-protective activity; however, the ability to adopt a toxic conformation seems to be specific for PrP. In this context, it is tempting to speculate that this ability might be linked to the unique feature of PrPC to convert into PrPSc. Our study emphasized a similar activity of Sho and PrP to protect cells against excitotoxin- and PrPΔHD-induced toxicity and revealed a crucial role for the N-terminal domain proximal to the HD. Both PrPΔN and ShoΔN showed a significantly reduced stress-protective activity. To address the possibility that both proteins interact with similar co-factors through their N termini, we fused the N-terminal domain of Sho to PrPΔN. The chimeric protein N-Sho·PrP-C had a stress-protective activity similar to that of WT Sho or WT PrP, indicating that the N-terminal domain of Sho could functionally replace that of PrP. There is neither sequence homology between the N-terminal domains of Sho and PrP nor an indication that the N-terminal domain of Sho is able to bind copper. The only similarity seems to be that both domains are intrinsically disordered. Based on the idea that intrinsically disordered domains are involved in protein-protein interactions, it appears plausible to assume that the N-terminal domain of PrP and Sho mediates interaction with the same co-receptor, required for stress-protective signaling. Further studies are now required to identify the putative co-receptor and signaling pathway(s) activated by PrP and Sho.

However, L. monocytogenes may develop resistance towards such bacteriocins. In this follow-up study, the transcriptomes of a high level (L502-1) and a low level (L502-6) spontaneous sakacin P-resistant mutant strain of L. monocytogenes were compared to the wild-type (L502). The growth of the resistant strains was reduced on mannose but not affected on cellobiose and the transcriptomics was performed during growth on these sugars. The mannose phosphotransferase system (PTS) encoded by the mptACD operon (mpt) is known for transporting mannose and also act as a receptor to class IIa bacteriocins. The mpt was repressed in L502-1 and this is in accordance with abolition of the bacteriocin receptor with resistance to class IIa bacteriocins. In contrast, the mpt was induced in L502-6. Despite the induction of the mpt, L502-6 showed 1,000 times more resistance phenotype and reduced growth on mannose suggesting the mannose-PTS may not be functional in L502-6. The microarray data suggests the presence of other transcriptional responses that may be linked to the sakacin P resistance phenotype particularly in L502-6. Most of commonly regulated genes encode proteins involved in transport and energy metabolism. The resistant strains displayed shift in general carbon catabolite control possibly mediated by the mpt. Our data suggest that the resistant strains may have a reduced virulence potential. Growth sugar- and mutant-specific responses were also revealed. The two resistant strains also displayed difference in stability of the sakacin P resistance phenotype, growth in the presence of both the lytic bacteriophage P100 and activated charcoal. Taken together, the present study showed that a single time exposure to the class IIa bacteriocin sakacin P may elicit contrasting phenotypic and transcriptome responses in L. monocytogenes possibly through regulation of the mpt."

The eye is an ideal organ for light-based imaging of molecular events underlying vascular and immune diseases. The phospholipid platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an important mediator of inflammation, the action of which in endothelial and immune cells in vivo is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of PAF in endothelial injury in uveitis. Here, we use our recently introduced in vivo molecular imaging approach in combination with the PAF inhibitors WEB 2086 (WEB) and ginkgolide B (GB). The differential inhibitory effects of WEB and GB in reducing LPS-induced endothelial injury in the choroid indicate an important role for PAF-like lipids, which might not require the PAF receptor for their signaling. P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1-mediated rolling of mouse leukocytes on immobilized P-selectin in our autoperfused microflow chamber assay revealed a significant reduction in rolling velocity on the cells' contact with PAF. Rolling cells that came in contact with PAF rapidly assumed morphological signs of cell activation, indicating that activation during rolling does not require integrins. Our results show a key role for PAF in mediating endothelial and leukocyte activation in acute ocular inflammation. Our in vivo molecular imaging provides a detailed view of cellular and molecular events in the complex physiological setting."

Antigenic load, costimulation, CD4-help, cytokines and chemokines fluctuate during the course of an antiviral immune response thus affecting CD8 T cell activation and memory conversion. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, naïve TCR transgenic LCMV-specific P14 CD8 T cells engaged at a late stage during the acute antiviral LCMV response showed reduced expansion kinetics but greater memory conversion in the spleen. Such late activated cells displayed a memory precursor effector phenotype already at the peak of the systemic antiviral response, suggesting that the environment determined their fate during antigen encounter. In the spleen, the majority of late transferred cells exhibited a central memory phenotype compared to the effector memory displayed by the early transferred cells. Increasing the inflammatory response by exogenous administration of IFNγ, PolyI:C or CpG did not affect memory conversion in the late transferred group, suggesting that the diverging antigen load early versus later during acute infection had determined their fate. In agreement, reduction in the LCMV antigenic load after ribavirin treatment enhanced the contribution of early transferred cells to the long lasting memory pool. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that naïve CD8 cells, exposed to reduced duration or concentration of antigen during viral infection convert into memory more efficiently, an observation that could have significant implications for vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W2030937093,"Numerous studies show that high circulating level of glucocorticosteroids is a biochemical characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These stress hormones can increase the amount of AD-like pathology in animal models of the disease. Since they also up-regulate the 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO), an enzyme which modulates amyloid beta (Aβ) formation, in the present paper we tested the hypothesis that this enzymatic pathway is involved in the glucocorticoid-induced pro-amyloidotic effect.Incubation of neuronal cells with dexamethasone resulted in a significant increase in 5-LO activity and Aβ formation. By contrast, pharmacological inhibition of 5-LO prevented the dexamethasone-dependent increase in Aβ levels. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts responded with a significant increase in Aβ formation after dexamethasone challenge. However, this effect was abolished when dexamethasone was incubated with fibroblasts genetically deficient for 5-LO. No difference in the glucocorticoid receptor levels was observed between the two groups. Finally, treatment of wild type mice with dexamethasone resulted in a significant increase in endogenous brain Aβ levels, which was prevented in mice genetically lacking 5-LO.These findings suggest that 5-LO plays a functional role in the glucocorticoid-induced brain AD-like amyloid pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2074151863,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking Mne1 are deficient in intron splicing in the gene encoding the Cox1 subunit of cytochrome oxidase but contain wild-type levels of the bc(1) complex. Thus, Mne1 has no role in splicing of COB introns or expression of the COB gene. Northern experiments suggest that splicing of the COX1 aI5β intron is dependent on Mne1 in addition to the previously known Mrs1, Mss116, Pet54, and Suv3 factors. Processing of the aI5β intron is similarly impaired in mne1Δ and mrs1Δ cells and overexpression of Mrs1 partially restores the respiratory function of mne1Δ cells. Mrs1 is known to function in the initial transesterification reaction of splicing. Mne1 is a mitochondrial matrix protein loosely associated with the inner membrane and is found in a high mass ribonucleoprotein complex specifically associated with the COX1 mRNA even within an intronless strain. Mne1 does not appear to have a secondary function in COX1 processing or translation, because disruption of MNE1 in cells containing intronless mtDNA does not lead to a respiratory growth defect. Thus, the primary defect in mne1Δ cells is splicing of the aI5β intron in COX1."

Moreover, the role of some highly conserved amino acids within members of the SLC4 family to which AE1 belongs has been assessed in AE1 transport properties. The results suggest that the same transport site within the AE1 spanning domain is involved in anion exchange or in cation transport. A functioning mechanism for this transport site is proposed according to transport properties of the different studied point mutations of AE1."
https://openalex.org/W2003675091,"Renal excretion of citrate, an inhibitor of calcium stone formation, is controlled mainly by reabsorption via the apical Na+-dicarboxylate cotransporter NaDC1 (SLC13A2) in the proximal tubule. Recently, it has been shown that the protein phosphatase calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK-506 induce hypocitraturia, a risk factor for nephrolithiasis in kidney transplant patients, but apparently through urine acidification. This suggests that these agents up-regulate NaDC1 activity. Using the Xenopus lævis oocyte and HEK293 cell expression systems, we examined first the effect of both anti-calcineurins on NaDC1 activity and expression. While FK-506 had no effect, CsA reduced NaDC1-mediated citrate transport by lowering heterologous carrier expression (as well as endogenous carrier expression in HEK293 cells), indicating that calcineurin is not involved. Given that CsA also binds specifically to cyclophilins, we determined next whether such proteins could account for the observed changes by examining the effect of selected cyclophilin wild types and mutants on NaDC1 activity and cyclophilin-specific siRNA. Interestingly, our data show that the cyclophilin isoform B is likely responsible for down-regulation of carrier expression by CsA and that it does so via its chaperone activity on NaDC1 (by direct interaction) rather than its rotamase activity. We have thus identified for the first time a regulatory partner for NaDC1, and have gained novel mechanistic insight into the effect of CsA on renal citrate transport and kidney stone disease, as well as into the regulation of membrane transporters in general.

Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 728-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the kidney, NaDC1 is distributed on the apical side of proximal tubular cells, where it reabsorbs divalent citrate (citrate2−) that exists at ∼10% of the free plasma citrate at physiological pH. However, the availability of citrate2− increases as pH lowers, due to protonation of citrate3−, thereby increasing the activity of NaDC1.

Urinary citrate plays a crucial physiological role in the prevention of nephrolithiasis by complexing Ca2+ ions, implying that NaDC1 also plays a crucial pathophysiological role (2Hamm L.L.

Consistent with this, NaDC1 gene-depleted mice develop hypercitraturia (5Ho H.T. Ko B.C. Cheung A.K. Lam A.K. Tam S. Chung S.K. Chung S.S.S. Kidney Int. 2007; 72: 63-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying NaDC1 regulation are poorly understood. Nevertheless, some insights have been gained from studies about the regulation of NaDC1 in metabolic acidosis and alkalosis. In metabolic acidosis, the function and expression of NaDC1 is up-regulated, leading to hypocitraturia, whereas in metabolic alkalosis, NaDC1 function is suppressed (6Aruga S. Wehrli S. Kaissling B.

Renal Physiol. 1985; 249: F590-F595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, immunosuppressive therapy using the drugs cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK-506 has been associated with hypocitraturia as a nephrolithiasis risk factor (8Stapenhorst L. Sassen R. Beck B. Laube N. Hesse A. Hoppe B. Pediatric Nephrology. 2005; 20: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Metabolic acidosis (caused by renal tubular acidosis) is one of the major nephrotoxic complications of these medications (9Heering P. Degenhardt S. Grabensee B. Nephron. 1996; 74: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Keven K. Ozturk R. Sengul S. Kutlay S. Ergun I. Erturk S. Erbay B. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2007; 22: 906-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In summary, tight regulation of NaDC1 transcription, synthesis, maturation, trafficking, and activity in the kidney is crucial for citraturia regulation. Identification of proteins that regulate NaDC1 will shed further light on the physiology of urinary citrate excretion. Recent observations with CsA and FK-506, which exert their normal effects by indirectly inhibiting the protein phosphatase calcineurin, suggested to us that the CsA-sensitive cyclophilins might be implicated in NaDC1 regulation. First, FK-506, which binds and specifically inhibits the function of FK-506-binding proteins, has been found to inhibit the stimulation of NaDC1 activity by metabolic acidosis in vivo in mice without affecting the basal activity (11Wan L. Tian X. Diggs L. Alpern R.J. Preisig P.A. ASN 42nd Annual Meeting and Scientific Exposition. 2009; (Abstr. F-PO1152)Google Scholar). Secondly, during functional screening of potential regulatory proteins using various inhibitors, we found that CsA caused marked inhibition of the basal activity of NaDC1 expressed in X. laevis oocytes, whereas FK-506 had no effect. 3M. J. Bergeron, unpublished data. CsA is known to specifically bind and inhibit the function of cyclophilins. Finally, the specific effect of CsA on other transporters such as the taurine and creatine transporters has been reported to be due to down-regulation of cell surface protein expression via the blockade of cyclophilin activity (12Chen H.

Typically, cyclophilins catalyze the rate-limiting peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerization (also called rotamase activity) necessary for proper protein folding (18Galat A. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1315-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In addition, they play a role as chaperones, escorting associated substrates during macromolecular assembly, intracellular trafficking and/or nuclear translocation (19Baker E.K. Colley N.J. Zuker C.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4886-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 20Rycyzyn M.A. Clevenger C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 6790-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). There are more than ten cyclophilin paralogs in mammals, distributed in different subcellular compartments where they play a role in diverse biological processes such as immune responses and neuronal function (18Galat A. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1315-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The cytosolic cyclophilin A (CypA), the archetypal cyclophilin, is the most abundant paralog in human tissues and the major target for CsA. The ER-resident cyclophilin B (CypB), the second member of the family, is also abundantly expressed and differs from CypA by the presence of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention motif (AIAKE) in its C terminus that allows its targeting to the secretory pathway (21Price E.R.

McKeon F.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 3931-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). With respect to the latter, the prototype cyclophilin chaperone is the CypB ortholog Drosophila ninaA. It has been shown to be essential in the secretory pathway of the major rhodopsin, Rh1, of Drosophila photoreceptor cells (19Baker E.K. Colley N.J. Zuker C.S.

Cell. 1991; 67: 255-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In this study, we assessed whether the CsA-sensitive cyclophilins regulate the expression and/or function of NaDC1. We carried out immunohistochemical, biochemical and functional analyses in X. laevis oocyte and HEK293 cell expression systems. We found that CsA reduced NaDC1 function through alteration of its total expression, caused by the inhibition of its synthesis, maturation and trafficking to the plasma membrane. Finally, we found that the effect of CsA on NaDC1 was due to the blockade of cyclophilin B chaperone activity. Nine different cDNA constructs were used in this study. The vectors Pol1 and pNWP were used for protein expression in X. laevis oocytes, whereas the vector pcDNA3.1 (+) (Invitrogen) was used for protein expression in HEK293 cells. The wt human (hu) NaDC1 cDNA was cloned by PCR reaction from a human kidney cDNA library and inserted into the Pol1 vector. 4The vector Pol1, the cDNA of wt huCypA, and wt and mutant huCypB, and the wt huTRPV6/pNWP construct were a gift from Dr. Paul Isenring (Laval University, QC, Canada), Dr. Charles V.

The mutant huCypBΔC-ter(204–208) was generated by the insertion of a prehybridized complementary oligonucleotide fragment, which possesses cohesive compatible ends and in which the 15 nucleotides encoding the C-terminal ER retention sequence AIAKE (corresponding to the amino acids 204 to 208) have been deleted (supplemental Table S1), into a digested wt huCypB fragment. The mutant huCypBΔN-ter(26–38) lacks the N-terminal sequence DEKKKGPKVTVKV (corresponding to the amino acids 26 to 38), which contains the nuclear translocation signal (20Rycyzyn M.A. Clevenger C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 6790-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), while the mutant huCypBR87A,F92A contains the mutations R87A and F92A that generates a rotamase-inactive cyclophilin B (20Rycyzyn M.A. Clevenger C.V.

Defolliculated stage V-VI oocytes were micro-injected with ∼10 ng of each cDNA-derived cRNA, and maintained for 72 h at 18 °C in modified Barth's medium (MBM; see supplemental Table S2) + antibiotics. In co-injection studies, a total amount of ∼20 ng of cRNA was micro-injected. HEK293 cells were grown on poly-d-lysine coated six-well plates or coverslips, and maintained in DMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin mixtures (Invitrogen). Cells were propagated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. At the time of transfection, the cells were transiently transfected with 3 μg of wt huNaDC1 cDNA using Lipofectamine 2,000 and OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) and incubated for 48 h. In siRNA experiments, 250 pmol of either huCypB siRNA (pool of 3 target-specific 20–25 nt siRNAs) or control scrambled siRNA (5′-aatcatctaagctggctttgc-3′) were transiently co-transfected simultaneously with huNaDC1. In this study, “24 h” and “72 h” are used to mean that the oocytes were treated with CsA and FK-506 (Sigma), and salubrinal (Tocris Bioscience) for the last 24 h of the 72 h incubation or for the entire time, respectively. HEK293 cells were treated with CsA during the last 24 h of the 48 h total transfection. DMSO (Sigma) was used as control treatment. Oocytes were incubated and treated with CsA for 72 h in 96-well plates (one oocyte per well). The viability has been determined with the XTT cell proliferation kit II (Roche), which is based on chemical reactions that lead to the formation of an orange dye by metabolically active cells, according to the supplier protocol. Uptakes were carried out at room temperature during 45 min (oocytes) or 10 min (HEK293 cells) in regular flux medium (R medium; see supplemental Table S2) + 2 mm cold citric acid + ∼2 μm [1,5-14C]citric acid (GE Healthcare). Uptakes were ended with three rinses in ice-cold R medium. Oocytes and HEK293 cells were lysed in 10% SDS and NaOH (0.5 n), respectively. After addition of scintillation fluid and brief stabilization time, [1,5-14C]citric acid was detected with the TRI-CARB 2100TR Liquid Scintillation Analyzer (Packard). For each experiment, counts from 5 to 12 oocytes, assuming equal membrane surface area of stage V-VI oocytes, or counts from one well of HEK293 cells, for which the protein concentration was determined, were averaged, transposed into influx rate, normalized to a control, and expressed as % ± S.E. in Equation 1. lnfux rate=(counts/oocyte or well)×[cold and radioactive](mM)in R medium[counts]in R medium×uptake time in R medium(hr)(Eq. 1) Twenty intact oocytes or one well of HEK293 cells were incubated (1 h, 4 °C) with 1.5 mg/ml of sulfo-LC-NHS-(+)-Biotin (Pierce) and lysed in 1 ml of RIPA solution (see supplemental Table S2) + Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). After incubation (2 h; 4 °C) and centrifugation at 18,000g (15 min; 4 °C), supernatants were transferred into new tubes. Cell surface biotinylated-proteins were purified by addition of 50 μl (oocytes) or 75 μl (HEK293 cells) of streptavidin agarose beads (Pierce), incubation on a rotator (overnight; 4 °C), washing and recovery of the beads by centrifugation at 9,000 × g (1 min; 4 °C). Finally, proteins were released from the beads by boiling in 2× sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analyses (described below). Twenty intact oocytes were lysed in 1 ml TBS + 1% Triton X-100 + 2 mm CaCl2 + Complete®. After incubation (2 h; 4 °C) and centrifugation at 18,000 × g (15 min; 4 °C), supernatants were transferred into new tubes. CypB, NaDC1 and TRPV6 proteins were immunoprecipitated using 2 μl/tube of rabbit polyclonal anti-HA (Sigma), anti-FLAG (Sigma) and anti-huTRPV6 (Alomone Laboratories) antibodies, respectively. After incubation on a rotator (2 h; 4 °C), 30 μl of protein A Sepharose CL-4B (GE Healthcare) was added to the samples, which were further incubated on a rotator (overnight; 4 °C). After washing and recovery of the beads by centrifugation at 9,000 × g (1 min; 4 °C), proteins were released from the beads by boiling in 2× sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analyses (described below). Proteins were migrated on 9% Tris-Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane blots (Millipore). After sequential incubations of the blots with primary and secondary antibodies, proteins were revealed by chemiluminescence using ECL solution (GE Healthcare). The primary antibodies mouse polyclonal anti-SLC13A2 (Abnova), rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclophilin B (Pierce), mouse monoclonal anti-HA (Sigma) and rabbit polyclonal anti-actin (I-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at a dilution of 1/1,000. The secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1/4,000 for the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse anti-IgG (Bio-Rad), and 1/20,000 for the HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit anti-IgG (Promega). Oocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (20 min, room temperature), permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 (5 min; room temperature), and sequentially incubated with mouse polyclonal anti-SLC13A2 antibodies (dil. 1/1,000; 1 h; room temperature) and Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse anti-IgG antibodies (Invitrogen) (dil. 1/4,000; 1 h; room temperature). For the co-staining of NaDC1 with the cell surface marker biotin in NaDC1-expressing HEK293 cells, the cells were first sequentially incubated (15 min; 4 °C) with 0.1 mg/ml of sulfo-LC-NHS-(+)-Biotin and streptavidin Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugate (Invitrogen) (dil. 1/2,000; 10 min; 4 °C). Then, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (30 min; 37 °C), permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 (5 min; 37 °C), and sequentially incubated with mouse polyclonal anti-SLC13A2 antibodies (dil. 1/1,000; 1 h; 37 °C) and Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse anti-IgG antibodies (dil. 1/4,000; 1 h; 37 °C). For the co-staining of NaDC1 with the ER marker calreticulin in huNaDC1-expressing HEK293 cells, the cells were first fixed and permeabilized as described above, and sequentially incubated with a mixture of mouse polyclonal anti-SLC13A2 antibodies (dil. 1/1,000) and chicken polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibodies (Abcam) (dil. 1/1,000; 1 h; 37 °C) and a mixture of Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse anti-IgG and Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-chicken anti-IgG antibodies (Invitrogen) (dil. 1/4,000; 1 h; 37 °C). Images were taken with a Nikon C1 confocal laser microscope system. In all metabolic labeling steps, DMSO or 50 μm CsA were present in the MBM medium. After micro-injection and incubation in MBM medium (2 h; 18 °C), ten oocytes/experiment were metabolically labeled (1 h; 18 °C) in MBM medium + 0.5 mCi/ml EasyTagTM EXPRE35S35S protein labeling Mix (Perkin Elmer). After washing, oocytes were incubated (72 h; 18 °C) in MBM medium containing nonradioactive Met (5 mm) and Cys (2 mm). Time 0 h was used as control. Oocytes were lysed in 200 μl of RIPA + Complete® and incubated on a rotator (2 h; 4 °C). Then, NaDC1 proteins were immunoprecipitated using 1 μl/tube of mouse polyclonal anti-SLC13A2 antibodies, purified, released from the beads, and subjected to SDS-PAGE as previously described. Gels were dried, and subjected to Coomassie Blue staining and autoradiography. Non-transfected cells (grown in 100-mm dish) were non- or treated with 200 ng/ml brefeldin A (Sigma) for 24 h, resuspended into PBS and centrifuged at 400 × g (10 min; 4 °C). Cells were then lysed in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (5 mm Hepes pH 7.4 and 0.5 mm EGTA) + Complete® and centrifuged at 3,000 × g (10 min; 4 °C). 1 mg of protein-containing supernatant was loaded onto the top of a linear sucrose gradient (0.45–2 m in homogenization buffer). After ultra-centrifugation at 200,000 × g (18 h; 4 °C), 750 μl fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the gradient and concentrated by TCA/acetone precipitation. Equal amounts of each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western analyses. The programs PLOT (B. Forbush) and DNAStar (Lasergene) were used. Where appropriate, differences between groups of variables were analyzed by Student's two-tail t-tests, rejecting the null hypothesis for p > 0.05. As mentioned earlier, our preliminary data revealed that NaDC1 activity in oocytes is markedly affected by CsA. However, because CsA is toxic at high doses, we examined the viability of NaDC1-expressing oocytes following 72 h CsA treatment. We used the XTT colorimetric viability assay, which is widely used to test toxicity in mammalian cell lines (24Fujiwara T. Ikeda Y. Arita K. Kanno T. Takehara Y. Yabuki M. Utsumi K. Transplant Int. 2003; 16: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). However, the assay has not previously been reported for the analysis of X. laevis oocyte viability, so we first evaluated its validity, based on the necrotic morphology of non-injected oocytes (supplemental Fig. S1). The results revealed a nice correlation between morphology and viability. Fig. 1A shows that the viability of oocytes expressing NaDC1 was not affected by CsA, demonstrating that they were not under apoptosis after CsA treatment. Excessive ER stress can also lead to apoptosis due to accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER. Previous reports showed that CsA-triggered ER stress in human endothelial and renal tubular cells could be prevented by salubrinal, a compound that protects cells from ER stress by selectively inhibiting the translation initiation factor eIF2α dephosphorylation (25Bouvier N. Flinois J.P. Gilleron J. Sauvage F.L. Legendre C. Beaune P. Thervet E. Anglicheau D. Pallet N. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 296: F160-F169Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Long K.

Antioxidants Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 2357-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that salubrinal treatment for 72 h had no effect on NaDC1 activity, and that salubrinal could not prevent the inhibitory effect of CsA (salubrinal+CsA). Thus, the effect of CsA on NaDC1 function does not occur via ER stress mechanisms. From the above studies, we concluded that the effect of CsA on NaDC1 must either be due to the direct blockade of calcineurin or cyclophilins activity. Thus, we further characterized CsA-sensitive NaDC1 activity in NaDC1-expressing oocytes, alongside FK-506 treatment. Fig. 2A shows that NaDC1-injected oocytes exhibit a 5-fold higher citrate transport activity than non-injected oocytes (∼20% activity) after 72 h treatment with the control DMSO. Results also show that the citrate influx in non-injected oocytes was unchanged following 72 h treatment with CsA or FK-506. For this reason, the endogenous influx is not presented in the following figures, since we assume that it accounts for less than ∼20% of NaDC1-injected oocyte citrate uptakes. In Fig. 2B, the activity of NaDC1-expressing oocytes was determined after 24 h and 72 h treatment with CsA or FK-506, and in their presence during 45-min uptakes. Results show that the treatments with CsA had a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on NaDC1 activity and that the inhibition with the highest dose of CsA (50 μm) was statistically different between the 24 h and 72 h treatments. However, 1 μm CsA had no effect on NaDC1 function, suggesting that calcineurin, which is inhibited by nanomolar amounts of CsA, is not involved. In contrast to CsA, the treatments with FK-506 had no effect on NaDC1 activity, indicating that the inhibition of NaDC1 function is specific to CsA. We used a concentration of only 5 μm for FK-506 compared with 50 μm for CsA because (a) FK-506 exhibits similar effects in vitro at concentrations even 100 times lower than those of CsA (29Kino T. Hatanaka H. Miyata S. Inamura N. Nishiyama M. Yajima T. Goto T. Okuhara M. Kohsaka M.M. Aoki H. J. Antibiot. 1987; 40: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), and (b) high doses of FK-506 are toxic to oocytes (16Tran T.T. Dai W. Sarkar H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35708-35714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To confirm that the observed effects with CsA were not due to the inhibition of calcineurin or to conformational changes in NaDC1 caused by the direct binding of CsA, we performed 45-min influx assays in the absence of CsA in the uptake medium. We observed that the function of NaDC1 was altered only when NaDC1-expressing oocytes were treated for 72 h with CsA, independently of the presence of CsA in the uptake medium during the 45 min (Fig. 2C). This suggests that the specific effect of CsA on NaDC1 function likely occurs during NaDC1 synthesis, maturation and/or trafficking, and is not due to the inhibition of calcineurin or conformational changes in NaDC1. Fig. 2D shows that the effect of the CsA treatment on NaDC1 function is time-dependent. Interestingly, between 6 and 8 h of treatment, we observed a drastic decrease (∼25%) in NaDC1 activity, suggesting that the expression of NaDC1 is regulated tightly and quickly during this time window. We also examined the effect of CsA on citrate transport activity in control (non-transfected) and NaDC1-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 2E). As in oocytes, treatments with CsA had a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the activity of heterologously expressed NaDC1, while low CsA concentration (0.1 μm) had no effect, suggesting that the molecular mechanism responsible of the CsA effect is identical in oocytes and HEK293 cells. In contrast to NaDC1-transfected cells, treatment with 10 μm CsA of non-transfected cells failed to produce an inhibitory effect. Note that in these experiments, it was not possible to discriminate the active fraction of endogenous NaDC1 from that of other endogenous proteins promoting citrate uptake, because of the lack of specific inhibitors. The specificity of the mouse polyclonal anti-SLC13A2 antibodies was verified by Western blot (Fig. 3A; lanes 1 and 2) and immunofluorescence (supplemental Fig. S2; images 1, 2) analysis of non- and NaDC1-injected oocytes. The controls also demonstrated that the immunoreactive bands with an apparent molecular mass ranging from ∼60 to ∼75 kDa correspond to the heterogeneously mature NaDC1 forms expressed at the cell surface, whereas the 50-kDa band in total lysates represents the immature form synthesized in the ER. Similar results were previously reported (30Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F642-F648PubMed Google Scholar). Given that NaDC1 is functional in oocytes (Fig. 2, A–D) and its expression at the cell surface (mature form) and in total lysate (immature form) is regulatable (see below), the expression levels of the mature and immature NaDC1 forms were analyzed separately through Western analyses of purified cell surface biotinylated proteins and total lysates, respectively. We first analyzed the total NaDC1 expression of NaDC1-expressing oocytes following 24 h or 72 h treatment with CsA and FK-506 (Fig. 3, A and B). Western blot analysis of cell surface and total lysate showed no effect of FK-506. Furthermore, these experiments revealed that CsA treatment for 24 h reduced the amount of NaDC1 expressed at the plasma membrane, but not the amount of the immature protein in the total lysate. CsA treatment for 72 h significantly reduced the expression of both mature and immature forms compared with the treatment for 24 h. These results suggest that CsA affects NaDC1 total expression through two distinct molecular mechanisms: (a) cytosolic trafficking and (b) regulation of the synthesis in the ER. Thus, the 24 h treatment only affects trafficking, whereas the 72 h treatment affects both trafficking and synthesis in the ER. Results of immunofluorescence examination of NaDC1 at the plasma membrane were consistent with the cell sur"
https://openalex.org/W2018739950,"Background Cell polarity genes including Crumbs (Crb) and Par complexes are essential for controlling photoreceptor morphogenesis. Among the Crb and Par complexes, Bazooka (Baz, Par-3 homolog) acts as a nodal component for other cell polarity proteins. Therefore, finding other genes interacting with Baz will help us to understand the cell polarity genes' role in photoreceptor morphogenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we have found a genetic interaction between baz and centrosomin (cnn). Cnn is a core protein for centrosome which is a major microtubule-organizing center. We analyzed the effect of the cnn mutation on developing eyes to determine its role in photoreceptor morphogenesis. We found that Cnn is dispensable for retinal differentiation in eye imaginal discs during the larval stage. However, photoreceptors deficient in Cnn display dramatic morphogenesis defects including the mislocalization of Crumbs (Crb) and Bazooka (Baz) during mid-stage pupal eye development, suggesting that Cnn is specifically required for photoreceptor morphogenesis during pupal eye development. This role of Cnn in apical domain modulation was further supported by Cnn's gain-of-function phenotype. Cnn overexpression in photoreceptors caused the expansion of the apical Crb membrane domain, Baz and adherens junctions (AJs). Conclusions/Significance These results strongly suggest that the interaction of Baz and Cnn is essential for apical domain and AJ modulation during photoreceptor morphogenesis, but not for the initial photoreceptor differentiation in the Drosophila photoreceptor."
https://openalex.org/W1965065023,"To eliminate hepatitis C virus (HCV) from infected hepatocytes, we generated two therapeutic molecules specifically activated in cells infected with HCV. A dominant active mutant of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and a negative regulator of HCV replication, VAP-C (Vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein subtype C), were fused with the C-terminal region of IPS-1 (IFNβ promoter stimulator-1), which includes an HCV protease cleavage site that was modified to be localized on the ER membrane, and designated cIRF7 and cVAP-C, respectively. In cells expressing the HCV protease, cIRF7 was cleaved and the processed fragment was migrated into the nucleus, where it activated various IFN promoters, including promoters of IFNα6, IFNβ, and IFN stimulated response element. Activation of the IFN promoters and suppression of viral RNA replication were observed in the HCV replicon cells and in cells infected with the JFH1 strain of HCV (HCVcc) by expression of cIRF7. Suppression of viral RNA replication was observed even in the IFN-resistant replicon cells by the expression of cIRF7. Expression of the cVAP-C also resulted in suppression of HCV replication in both the replicon and HCVcc infected cells. These results suggest that delivery of the therapeutic molecules into the liver of hepatitis C patients, followed by selective activation of the molecules in HCV-infected hepatocytes, is a feasible method for eliminating HCV."
https://openalex.org/W1989364443,"Background Despite the presence of papillary structures and papillary tumors in humans, the mechanism of papillae formation is unknown. We describe herein a novel role for Niemann-Pick disease type 2C (NPC2) protein, a cholesterol binding protein in the lysosome, in papillae formation. Methodology/Principal Finding We examined NPC2 protein expression in surgical samples of papillary tissues by immunohistochemical stain, and all papillary tissues expressed NPC2 protein in the epithelium. To examine our hypothesis of NPC2 protein-mediated papillae formation, we carried out xenograft experiments using wild H460 cells (large cell lung carcinoma cell line) that constitutively expressed abundant NPC2 protein and NPC2 protein-depleted H460 cells by NPC2 shRNA. The xenografts of wild H460 cells and empty shRNA vector cells showed distinct papillae formation, whereas NPC2 protein-depleted H460 cells displayed markedly reduced or no papillae. Since all papillary tissues have open spaces we examined whether NPC2 protein might also contribute to the creation of open spaces. The TUNEL assay in the xenografts of wild and empty shRNA vector H460 cells showed massive cell death, and NPC2 protein-depleted cells displayed minimal cell death. Measurement of caspase 3/7 activities in cultured H460 cells supported NPC2 protein-mediated apoptotic cell death. The presence of excess NPC2 protein, however, did not always produce papillae as seen in the xenografts of CHO cells that were stably transfected with NPC2. Conclusions/Significance The NPC2 protein of certain cells forms papillae coupled with apoptosis that creates open space. This protein may have future applications to modulate papillae formation and papillary growth in tumor tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2004811865,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase peripheral stalk is composed of the OSCP, h, d, and b subunits. The b subunit has two membrane-spanning domains and a large hydrophilic domain that extends along one side of the enzyme to the top of F(1). In contrast, the Escherichia coli peripheral stalk has two identical b subunits, and subunits with substantially altered lengths can be incorporated into a functional F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase. The differences in subunit structure between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic peripheral stalks raised a question about whether the two stalks have similar physical and functional properties. In the present work, the length of the S. cerevisiae b subunit has been manipulated to determine whether the F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase exhibited the same tolerances as in the bacterial enzyme. Plasmid shuffling was used for ectopic expression of altered b subunits in a strain carrying a chromosomal disruption of the ATP4 gene. Wild type growth phenotypes were observed for insertions of up to 11 and a deletion of four amino acids on a nonfermentable carbon source. In mitochondria-enriched fractions, abundant ATP hydrolysis activity was seen for the insertion mutants. ATPase activity was largely oligomycin-insensitive in these mitochondrial fractions. In addition, very poor complementation was seen in a mutant with an insertion of 14 amino acids. Lengthier deletions yielded a defective enzyme. The results suggest that although the eukaryotic peripheral stalk is near its minimum length, the b subunit can be extended a considerable distance."
