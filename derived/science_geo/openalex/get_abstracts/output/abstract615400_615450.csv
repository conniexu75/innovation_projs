https://openalex.org/W2887008427,"To determine the validity of the lactate threshold (LT) and maximal oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]) determined during graded exercise test (GXT) of different durations and using different LT calculations. Trained male cyclists (n = 17) completed five GXTs of varying stage length (1, 3, 4, 7 and 10 min) to establish the LT, and a series of 30-min constant power bouts to establish the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS). [Formula: see text] was assessed during each GXT and a subsequent verification exhaustive bout (VEB), and 14 different LTs were calculated from four of the GXTs (3, 4, 7 and 10 min)-yielding a total 56 LTs. Agreement was assessed between the highest [Formula: see text] measured during each GXT ([Formula: see text]) as well as between each LT and MLSS. [Formula: see text] and LT data were analysed using mean difference (MD) and intraclass correlation (ICC).The [Formula: see text] value from GXT1 was 61.0 ± 5.3 mL.kg-1.min-1 and the peak power 420 ± 55 W (mean ± SD). The power at the MLSS was 264 ± 39 W. [Formula: see text] from GXT3, 4, 7, 10 underestimated [Formula: see text] by ~1-5 mL.kg-1.min-1. Many of the traditional LT methods were not valid and a newly developed Modified Dmax method derived from GXT4 provided the most valid estimate of the MLSS (MD = 1.1 W; ICC = 0.96).The data highlight how GXT protocol design and data analysis influence the determination of both [Formula: see text] and LT. It is also apparent that [Formula: see text] and LT cannot be determined in a single GXT, even with the inclusion of a VEB."
https://openalex.org/W2884803754,"The life expectancy for pancreatic cancer patients has seen no substantial changes in the last 40 years as very few and mostly just palliative treatments are available. As the five years survival rate remains around 5%, the identification of novel pharmacological targets and development of new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of the G protein-coupled receptor GPR55, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, reduces pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo and we propose that this may represent a novel strategy to inhibit pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression. Specifically, we show that genetic ablation of Gpr55 in the KRASWT/G12D/TP53WT/R172H/Pdx1-Cre+/+ (KPC) mouse model of PDAC significantly prolonged survival. Importantly, KPC mice treated with a combination of the GPR55 antagonist Cannabidiol (CBD) and gemcitabine (GEM, one of the most used drugs to treat PDAC), survived nearly three times longer compared to mice treated with vehicle or GEM alone. Mechanistically, knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of GPR55 reduced anchorage-dependent and independent growth, cell cycle progression, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and protein levels of ribonucleotide reductases in PDAC cells. Consistent with this, genetic ablation of Gpr55 reduced proliferation of tumour cells, MAPK signalling and ribonucleotide reductase M1 levels in KPC mice. Combination of CBD and GEM inhibited tumour cell proliferation in KPC mice and it opposed mechanisms involved in development of resistance to GEM in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that the tumour suppressor p53 regulates GPR55 protein expression through modulation of the microRNA miR34b-3p. Our results demonstrate the important role played by GPR55 downstream of p53 in PDAC progression. Moreover our data indicate that combination of CBD and GEM, both currently approved for medical use, might be tested in clinical trials as a novel promising treatment to improve PDAC patients’ outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2883541717,"Background A Core Outcome Set (COS) is an agreed list of outcomes that are measured and reported in all clinical trials for a particular health condition. An ‘e-Delphi’ is an increasingly popular method for developing a COS whereby stakeholders are consulted via a multi-round online survey to reach agreement regarding the most important outcomes. Many COS studies seek diverse, international input that includes professionals and healthcare users. However, the recruitment and retention of participants can be deterred by various factors (e.g. language barriers and iterative, time-consuming rounds). This report evaluates the effectiveness of recruitment and retention methods used in the Core Outcome Measures in Tinnitus International Delphi (COMiT’ID) study using participant feedback from healthcare users, healthcare practitioners, researchers, commercial representatives and funders. Methods A range of methods were applied to recruit participants to the study and maintain engagement over the three rounds. Feedback on recruitment and retention methods was collected using a twenty-item online questionnaire, with free text comments. Results A personalised email invitation was the most frequent recruitment route, and 719 professionals and healthcare users consented to take part. Retention of each stakeholder group ranged from 76 to 91% completing all three e-Delphi rounds. Feedback was given by 379 respondents. A majority of respondents were satisfied with the study methods that were implemented to promote retention. Over 55% indicated that their overall experience closely matched their expectations at the start of the study, and over 90% felt that their contribution was appreciated. Conclusions This report highlights study methods that worked well with respect to recruitment and retention, and those that did not. Findings provide a unique contribution to the growing evidence base of good practice in COS development by demonstrating the relative effectiveness of recruitment and retention methods for an e-Delphi survey. Trial registration This project was registered (November 2014) in the database of the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative. The protocol is published in Trials (doi:10.1186/s13063-017-2123-0)."
https://openalex.org/W2884160031,"Prized for their ability to rapidly generate chemical complexity by building new ring systems and stereocentres1, cycloaddition reactions have featured in numerous total syntheses2 and are a key component in the education of chemistry students3. Similarly, carbon-carbon (C-C) cross-coupling methods are integral to synthesis because of their programmability, modularity and reliability4. Within the area of drug discovery, an overreliance on cross-coupling has led to a disproportionate representation of flat architectures that are rich in carbon atoms with orbitals hybridized in an sp2 manner5. Despite the ability of cycloadditions to introduce multiple carbon sp3 centres in a single step, they are less used6. This is probably because of their lack of modularity, stemming from the idiosyncratic steric and electronic rules for each specific type of cycloaddition. Here we demonstrate a strategy for combining the optimal features of these two chemical transformations into one simple sequence, to enable the modular, enantioselective, scalable and programmable preparation of useful building blocks, natural products and lead scaffolds for drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2886557860,"India contributes the highest global share of deaths among the under-fives. Continuous monitoring of the reduction in the under-five mortality rate (U5MR) at local level is thus essential to set priorities for policy-makers and health professionals. In this study, we aimed to provide an update on district-level disparities in the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and the U5MR with special reference to Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3) on preventable deaths among new-borns and children under five.We used recently released population-based cross-sectional data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted in 2015-2016. We used the synthetic cohort probability approach to analyze the full birth history information of women aged 15-49 to estimate the NMR and U5MR for the ten years preceding the survey.Both the NMR and U5MR vary enormously across Indian districts. With respect to the SDG3 target for 2030 for the NMR and the U5MR, the estimated NMR for India for the period studied is about 2.4 times higher, while the estimated U5MR is about double. At district level, while 9% of the districts have already reached the NMR targeted in SDG3, nearly half (315 districts) are not likely to achieve the 2030 target even if they realize the NMR reductions achieved by their own states between the last two rounds of National Family Health Survey of India. Similarly, less than one-third of the districts (177) of India are unlikely to achieve the SDG3 target on the U5MR by 2030. While the majority of high-risk districts for the NMR and U5MR are located in the poorer states of north-central and eastern India, a few high-risk districts for NMR also fall in the rich and advanced states. About 97% of districts from Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh, for example, are unlikely to meet the SDG3 target for preventable deaths among new-borns and children under age five, irrespective of gender.To achieve the SDG3 target on preventable deaths by 2030, the majority of Indian districts clearly need to make a giant leap to reduce their NMR and U5MR."
https://openalex.org/W2886200927,"Introduction Administrative data are used to generate estimates of sepsis epidemiology and can serve as source for quality indicators. Aim was to compare estimates on sepsis incidence and mortality based on different ICD-code abstraction strategies and to assess their validity for sepsis case identification based on a patient sample not pre-selected for presence of sepsis codes. Materials and methods We used the national DRG-statistics for assessment of population-level sepsis incidence and mortality. Cases were identified by three previously published International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding strategies for sepsis based on primary and secondary discharge diagnoses (clinical sepsis codes (R-codes), explicit coding (all sepsis codes) and implicit coding (combined infection and organ dysfunction codes)). For the validation study, a stratified sample of 1120 adult patients admitted to a German academic medical center between 2007–2013 was selected. Administrative diagnoses were compared to a gold standard of clinical sepsis diagnoses based on manual chart review. Results In the validation study, 151/937 patients had sepsis. Explicit coding strategies performed better regarding sensitivity compared to R-codes, but had lower PPV. The implicit approach was the most sensitive for severe sepsis; however, it yielded a considerable number of false positives. R-codes and explicit strategies underestimate sepsis incidence by up to 3.5-fold. Between 2007–2013, national sepsis incidence ranged between 231-1006/100,000 person-years depending on the coding strategy. Conclusions In the sample of a large tertiary care hospital, ICD-coding strategies for sepsis differ in their accuracy. Estimates using R-codes are likely to underestimate the true sepsis incidence, whereas implicit coding overestimates sepsis cases. Further multi-center evaluation is needed to gain better understanding on the validity of sepsis coding in Germany."
https://openalex.org/W2886890139,"Syphilis is an important public health problem and an increasing incidence has been noted in recent years. Characterization of strain diversity through molecular data plays a critical role in the epidemiological understanding of this re-emergence. We here propose a new high-resolution multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (TPA). We analyzed 30 complete and draft TPA genomes obtained directly from clinical samples or from rabbit propagated strains to identify suitable typing loci and tested the new scheme on 120 clinical samples collected in Switzerland and France. Our analyses yielded three loci with high discriminatory power: TP0136, TP0548, and TP0705. Together with analysis of the 23S rRNA gene mutations for macrolide resistance, we propose these loci as MLST for TPA. Among clinical samples, 23 allelic profiles as well as a high percentage (80% samples) of macrolide resistance were revealed. The new MLST has higher discriminatory power compared to previous typing schemes, enabling distinction of TPA from other treponemal bacteria, distinction between the two main TPA clades (Nichols and SS14), and differentiation of strains within these clades."
https://openalex.org/W2886311104,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) phosphorylates and thereby regulates a wide range of protein substrates involved in diverse cellular functions. Some GSK3β substrates, such as c-Myc and Snail, are nuclear transcription factors, suggesting the possibility that GSK3β function is controlled through its nuclear localization. Here, using ARPE-19 and MDA-MB-231 human cell lines, we found that inhibition of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) leads to partial redistribution of GSK3β from the cytosol to the nucleus and to a GSK3β-dependent reduction of the levels of both c-Myc and Snail. mTORC1 is known to be controlled by metabolic cues, such as by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or amino acid abundance, and we observed here that AMPK activation or amino acid deprivation promotes GSK3β nuclear localization in an mTORC1-dependent manner. GSK3β was detected on several distinct endomembrane compartments, including lysosomes. Consistently, disruption of late endosomes/lysosomes through a perturbation of RAS oncogene family member 7 (Rab7) resulted in loss of GSK3β from lysosomes and in enhanced GSK3β nuclear localization as well as GSK3β-dependent reduction of c-Myc levels. These findings indicate that the nuclear localization and function of GSK3β is suppressed by mTORC1 and suggest a link between metabolic conditions sensed by mTORC1 and GSK3β-dependent regulation of transcriptional networks controlling cellular biomass production."
https://openalex.org/W2885738433,"Messenger RNA (mRNA) transfection is a developing field that has applications in research and gene therapy. Potentially, mRNA transfection can be mediated efficiently by cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) as they may be modified to target specific tissues. However, whilst CPPs are well-documented to transfect oligonucleotides and plasmids, mRNA transfection by CPPs has barely been explored. Here we report that peptides, including a truncated form of protamine and the same peptide fused to the CPP Xentry (Xentry-protamine; XP), can transfect mRNAs encoding reporter genes into human cells. Further, this transfection is enhanced by the anti-malarial chloroquine (CQ) and the toll-like receptor antagonist E6446 (6-[3-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)propoxy)-2-(4-(3-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)propoxy)phenyl]benzo[d]oxazole), with E6446 being >5-fold more potent than CQ at enhancing this transfection. Finally, E6446 facilitated the transfection by XP of mRNA encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, the protein mutated in cystic fibrosis. As such, these findings introduce E6446 as a novel transfection enhancer and may be of practical relevance to researchers seeking to improve the mRNA transfection efficiency of their preferred CPP."
https://openalex.org/W2886709905,"Online health communities facilitate communication among people with health problems. Most prior studies focus on examining characteristics of these communities in sharing content, while limited work has explored social interactions between communities with different stances on a health problem. Here, we analyse a large communication network of individuals affected by eating disorders on Twitter and explore how communities of individuals with different stances on the disease interact online. Based on a large set of tweets posted by individuals who self-identify with eating disorders online, we establish the existence of two communities: a large community reinforcing disordered eating behaviours and a second, smaller community supporting efforts to recover from the disease. We find that individuals tend to mainly interact with others within the same community, with limited interactions across communities and inter-community interactions characterized by more negative emotions than intra-community interactions. Moreover, by studying the associations between individuals' behavioural characteristics and interpersonal connections in the communication network, we present the first large-scale investigation of social norms in online health communities, particularly on how a community approves of individuals' behaviours. Our findings shed new light on how people form online health communities and can have broad clinical implications on disease prevention and online intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2885087837,"Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate the vascular and parenchymal CT imaging findings, including vessel and cardiac chamber diameter measurements, in patients newly diagnosed with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). The CT imaging findings were correlated with hemodynamic measurements and patient outcome. Methods Vascular and parenchymal CT findings were assessed on retrospectively ECG-gated MDCT angiography scans in 76 patients newly diagnosed with CTEPH. The diameters of the right and left ventricle (dRV, dLV), the right and left atrium (dRA, dLA), the ascending aorta (dAA), the right and left pulmonary arteries (drPA, dlPA), and the main pulmonary artery (dPA) were measured on axial CT scans. The CT imaging findings were correlated with demographic and hemodynamic data and adverse patient outcome due to right heart failure (RHF). Results The majority of patients showed chronic PE, mosaic perfusion, disparity in segmental vessel size, parenchymal densities, bronchial dilatation, and bronchial collaterals in CT. Mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) was not significantly different in patients with and those without chronic PE, mosaic perfusion, disparity in segmental vessel size, parenchymal densities, bronchial dilatation, and bronchial collaterals. Mean PAP showed significant correlations with the CT metrics of dRV/dLV ratio, dRA, dRV, dPA and dPA/dAA ratio, but no correlation with the central thrombi score. By backward linear regression, the dPA/dAA ratio independently correlated with mPAP. Patients who died of RHF tended to have a higher frequency of exclusively chronic peripheral PE and greater dRV/dLV ratios on presenting CT scans compared with survivors. Conclusion The majority of patients newly diagnosed with CTEPH show vascular signs of chronic PE, mosaic perfusion, parenchymal densities, disparity in segmental vessel size, bronchial dilatation, and bronchial collaterals on presenting CT scans. Particularly CTEPH patients with exclusively chronic peripheral PE and increased dRV/dLV ratios seem to be at risk of adverse outcome due to RHF."

In this study, we found that application of potassium (K) fertilizer could decrease the occurrence of SCN at two field sites. Furthermore, the application of K could suppress Heterodera glycines with the activation of Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL) and Polyphenol Oxidase (PPO) expression via pot experiments in a greenhouse. The release of cinnamic, ferulic and salicylic acids was significantly enhanced by K application of 3 mM, and each of three acids can dramatically constrain Heterodera glycines in vitro. This research indicated that K induce multiple mechanisms to improve the resistance of soybean against SCN and provide a new strategy to control SCN in fields with nutrient application."
https://openalex.org/W2884468897,"Convincing data that support routine use of preventive therapy against hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in radiotherapy (RT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence, clinical significance, and risk factors of HBV reactivation after RT. Medical records of 133 HBsAg (+) HCC patients who received radiotherapy from March 2009 to February 2016 were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: 1) non-antiviral group, those who did not receive antiviral therapy before RT (n = 27); and antiviral group (those who underwent antiviral therapy before RT) (n = 106). Factors related to HBV reactivation in HCC patients were evaluated. 17 (12.7%) of 133 patients developed HBV reactivation after RT. Patients in the antiviral group had significantly lower rates of HBV reactivation than those in the non-antiviral group (7.5% vs. 33.3%, p<0.001). HBV related hepatitis was also lower in the antiviral group (3.8% vs. 14.8%, p = 0.031). In multivariate analysis, absence of antiviral treatment (OR: 8.339, 95% CI: 2.532-27.470, p<0.001) and combined treatment of RT with transarterial chemoembolizatoin (TACE) (OR: 5.313, 95% CI: 1.548-18.232, p = 0.008) were risk factors for HBV reactivation. HBV reactivation can occur after radiotherapy. Combination treatment of RT with TACE and non-antiviral treatment are major risk factors for HBV reactivation during or after RT. Therefore, preventive antiviral therapy should be recommended for patients with HCC who are scheduled to receive RT."
https://openalex.org/W2883297198,"This study reports the development of a garden pea genotype ‘VRPM–901–5’ producing five flowers per peduncle at multiple flowering nodes, by using single plant selection approach from a cross ‘VL-8 × PC-531’. In addition, five other stable genetic stocks, namely VRPM-501, VRPM–502, VRPM–503, VRPM–901–3 and VRPSeL–1 producing three flowers per peduncle at multiple flowering nodes were also developed. All these unique genotypes were of either mid- or late- maturity groups. Furthermore, these multi-flowering genotypes were identified during later generations (F4 onward), which might be because of fixation of certain QTLs or recessive gene combinations. Surprisingly, a common parent PC–531, imparting multi-flowering trait in ten cross combinations was identified. Thus, the genotype PC–531 seems to harbor some recessive gene(s) or QTLs that in certain combination(s) express the multi-flowering trait. The interaction between genotype and environment showed that temperature (11–20°C) plays a key role in expression of the multi-flowering trait besides genetic background. Furthermore, the possible relationship between various multi-flowering regulatory genes such as FN, FNA, NEPTUNE, SN, DNE, HR and environmental factors was also explored, and a comprehensive model explaining the multi-flowering trait in garden pea is proposed."

We used the parametric g-formula to estimate 16-year CHD risk under different levels and durations of exposure to LDL-cholesterol (low: <130 mg/dL, moderate: 130 to <160 mg/dL, high 160 to <190 mg/dL, and very high: ≥190 mg/dL) and systolic blood pressure (low: <120 mmHg, prehypertension: 120 to <140 mmHg, stage 1 hypertension: 140 to <160 mmHg, and stage 2 hypertension: ≥160 mmHg).The estimated 16-year CHD risk under exposure to low LDL was 8.2% (95% CI = 7.0-9.6). The 16-year CHD risk under exposure to moderate LDL was 8.9% (7.8-10.1) which was similar to CHD risk under 8 years of low LDL followed by 8 years of high LDL at 9.0% (7.7-10.3); and 12 years of low LDL followed by 4 years of very high LDL at 8.8% (7.6-10.1). The results for blood pressure were similar.Long-term exposure to moderate levels of LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure had a similar impact on CHD risk as shorter exposures to levels considered 'high' per clinical guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2885250084,"Remote island nations face a number of challenges in addressing concerns about shark population status, including access to rigorously collected data and resources to manage fisheries. At present, very little data are available on shark populations in the Solomon Islands and scientific surveys to document shark and ray diversity and distribution have not been completed. We aimed to provide a baseline of the relative abundance and diversity of reef sharks and rays and assess the major drivers of reef shark abundance/biomass in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands using stereo baited remote underwater video. On average reef sharks were more abundant than in surrounding countries such as Fiji and Indonesia, yet below that of remote islands without historical fishing pressure, suggesting populations are relatively healthy but not pristine. We also assessed the influence of location, habitat type/complexity, depth and prey biomass on reef shark abundance and biomass. Location was the most important factor driving reef shark abundance and biomass with two times the abundance and a 43% greater biomass of reef sharks in the more remote locations, suggesting fishing may be impacting sharks in some areas. Our results give a much needed baseline and suggest that reef shark populations are still relatively unexploited, providing an opportunity for improved management of sharks and rays in the Solomon Islands."
https://openalex.org/W2885954995,"This paper investigated the seismic retrofitting of an existing cable-stayed bridge through the use of a seismic isolation system. The bridge is situated in a high seismic zone. During the Saguenay earthquake 1988, one of the anchorage plates of the bridge supports failed. Herein, several configurations of seismic isolation system were considered to identify an appropriate solution for the seismic retrofitting of the bridge in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. A three-dimensional model of the bridge was created, and its seismic behavior studied through nonlinear dynamic time-history analysis. The comparative performance study among the five retrofitting configurations showed that the partial seismic isolation of the bridge led to an enhancement of the seismic response of the bridge in one direction only. However, the overall seismic response of the cable-stayed bridge substantially improved in the longitudinal and transverse directions in cases where the isolation systems were utilized between the supports and the deck-tower connection of the bridge."
https://openalex.org/W2884083061,"Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) causes substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide. The country of Georgia conducts sentinel surveillance to monitor SARI activity and changes in its infectious etiology. This study characterizes the epidemiology of SARI in Georgia over the 2015/16 and 2016/17 influenza seasons, compares clinical presentations by etiology, and estimates influenza vaccine effectiveness using a test-negative design.SARI cases were selected through alternate day systematic sampling between September 2015 and March 2017 at five sentinel surveillance inpatient sites. Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae using a multiplex diagnostic system. We present SARI case frequencies by demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, and clinical presentation, and used logistic regression to estimate influenza A vaccine effectiveness.1,624 patients with SARI were identified. More cases occurred in February (28.7%; 466/1624) than other months. Influenza was the dominant pathogen in December-February, respiratory syncytial virus in March-May, and rhinovirus in June-November. Serious clinical symptoms including breathing difficulties, ICU hospitalization, and artificial ventilation were common among influenza A and human metapneumovirus cases. For influenza A/H3, a protective association between vaccination and disease status was observed when cases with unknown vaccination status were combined with those who were unvaccinated (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.97).Multi-pathogen diagnostic testing through Georgia's sentinel surveillance provides useful information on etiology, seasonality, and demographic associations. Influenza A and B were associated with more severe outcomes, although the majority of the population studied was unvaccinated. Findings from sentinel surveillance can assist in prevention planning."

Participants were excluded if they: (1) had impaired mobility and limited extremities functionality; (2) had not been in stable health condition and could not adhere to the exercise regime; (3) had communication difficulties and limited ability to follow instructions.Participants were randomly assigned to the Baduanjin group or the control group. Those in the Baduanjin group received 16 weeks of Baduanjin exercise training, while those in the control group kept the original exercise mode unchanged. The Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease 6-item Scale (SEMCD6) was administered to subjects before and after intervention.Demographic data showed that 65.12% of the enrolled 129 participants were aged 65 or older, 92.25% received less than 12 years of education, and 68.21% participants' monthly income was less than 1999 RMB. Before intervention, SEMCD6 scores of 86.36% participants in Baduanjin group were below 7 points, while 85.71% in control group; after 16 weeks of Baduanjin exercise, SEMCD6 scores lower than 7 points in Baduanjin group (21.21%) were significantly lower than that of the control group (84.13%). The increase of SEMCD6 scores in Baduanjin group was statistically significant in the confidence to keep the fatigue, to keep the physical discomfort or pain, to keep the emotional distress and do the different tasks and activities (P<0.01).Adults with cardiovascular diseases in community have lower level of education, most of whom have a low monthly income; thus, community dwelling cardiovascular disease patients are more suitable for an economic program to persist their long term management of the disease. Baduanjin is a traditional Chinese medicine regimen with less physical and cognitive demand; community based exercise of Baduanjin could help to increase self-efficacy in patients with cardiovascular diseases, thus better self-management of rehabilitation process."
https://openalex.org/W2887582657,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) has a poor prognosis and is largely resistant to standard treatments, so it is important to seek novel therapeutic strategies for this disease. Cancer-initiating cells (CICs) were previously identified in MM using stem cell-associated markers in combination with spheroid cultures. However, the mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of CICs in MM remain to be fully explored. Here we showed that the CICs, which had high aldehyde dehydrogenase levels (ALDHbright) and stem cell-associated genes, were expanded in MM cells cultured under sphere-forming conditions. The MM spheroids also initiated tumors in immunodeficient mice more efficiently than did conventional adherent MM cells. In the MM spheroids, the expression of hyaluronan (HA) synthases was upregulated. Inhibiting the HA synthesis or CD44 functions by gene knockdown or neutralizing antibody abolished the formation of large-sized spheroids and the expansion of ALDHbright CICs. The expression of activin-A was also increased in the spheroids, and type I activin-A receptor subunit (ALK4) was upregulated in the ALDHbright CICs. The neutralization of activin-A or functional inactivation of ALK4 diminished the ALDHbright CICs without affecting spheroid formation. The knockdown of CD44 or ALK4 strongly suppressed the tumor growth in immunodeficient mice. These results together suggest that the HA–CD44 and activin-A–ALK4 pathways differentially regulate the spheroid formation and maintenance of ALDHbright CICs in MM cells, and that both pathways play critical roles in tumor growth in immunodeficient hosts. Our findings provide a novel therapeutic option for MM that targets signaling pathways that promote the CIC compartment through CD44 and ALK4."
https://openalex.org/W2887853930,"Bile acids are critical contributors to the regulation of whole body glucose homeostasis; however, the mechanisms remain incompletely defined. While the hydrophilic bile acid subtype, ursodeoxycholic acid, has been shown to attenuate hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and thereby improve glucose regulation in mice, the effect of hydrophobic bile acid subtypes on ER stress and glucose regulation in vivo is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the hydrophobic bile acid subtype, deoxycholic acid (DCA), on ER stress and glucose regulation. Eight week old C57BL/6J mice were fed a high fat diet supplemented with or without DCA. Glucose regulation was assessed by oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance testing. In addition, circulating bile acid profile and hepatic insulin and ER stress signaling were measured. DCA supplementation did not alter body weight or food intake, but did impair glucose regulation. Consistent with the impairment in glucose regulation, DCA increased the hydrophobicity of the circulating bile acid profile, decreased hepatic insulin signaling and increased hepatic ER stress signaling. Together, these data suggest that dietary supplementation of DCA impairs whole body glucose regulation by disrupting hepatic ER homeostasis in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2885227025,"Complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence of a worm-hunting cone snail, Conus quercinus, was reported in this study. Its mitogenome, the longest one (16,460 bp) among reported Conus specie, is composed of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and one D-loop region. The mitochondrial gene arrangement is highly-conserved and identical to other reported. However, the D-loop region of C. quercinus is the longest (943 bp) with the higher A+T content (71.3%) and a long AT tandem repeat stretch (68 bp). Subsequent phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that three different dietary types (vermivorous, molluscivorous and piscivorous) of cone snails are clustered separately, suggesting that the phylogenetics of cone snails is related to their dietary types. In conclusion, our current work improves our understanding of the mitogenomic structure and evolutionary status of the vermivorous C. quercinus, which support the putative hypothesis that the Conus ancestor was vermivorous."
https://openalex.org/W2887383641,"A simple approach to enable water-management agencies employing free data to create a single set of water quality predictive equations with satisfactory accuracy is proposed. Multiple regression-derived equations based on surface reflectance, band ratios, and environmental factors as predictor variables for concentrations of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and Total Nitrogen (TN) were derived using a hybrid forward-selection method that considers both p-value and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) in the forward-selection process. Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS images were jointly utilized with environmental factors, such as wind speed and water surface temperature, to derive the single set of equations. Through splitting data into calibration and validation groups, the coefficients of determination are 0.73 for TSS calibration and 0.70 for TSS validation, respectively. The coefficients of determination for TN calibration and validation are 0.64 and 0.37, respectively. Among all chosen predictor variables, ratio of reflectance of visible red (Band 3 for Landsat TM and ETM+, or Band 4 for Landsat OLI/TIRS) to visible blue (Band 1 for Landsat TM and ETM+, or Band 2 for Landsat OLI/TIRS) has a strong influence on the predictive power for TSS retrieval. Environmental factors including wind speed, remote sensing-derived water surface temperature, and time difference (in days) between the image acquisition and water sampling were found to be important in water-quality quantity estimation. The hybrid forward-selection method consistently yielded higher validation accuracy than that of the conventional forward-selection approach."
https://openalex.org/W2883328763,"Measuring accurate thresholds in children can be challenging. A typical psychophysical experiment is usually too long to keep children engaged. However, a reduction in the number of trials decreases the precision of the threshold estimate. We evaluated the efficiency of forced-choice paradigms with 2 or 4 alternatives (2-AFC, 4-AFC) in a disparity detection experiment. 4-AFC paradigms are statistically more efficient, but also more cognitively demanding, which might offset their theoretical advantage in young children.We ran simulations evaluating bias and precision of threshold estimates of 2-AFC and 4-AFC paradigms. In addition, we measured disparity thresholds in 43 children (aged 6 to 17 years) with a 4-AFC paradigm and in 49 children (aged 4 to 17 years) with a 2-AFC paradigm, both using an adaptive weighted one-up one-down staircase.Simulations indicated a similar bias and precision for a 2-AFC paradigm with double the number of trials as a 4-AFC paradigm. On average, estimated threshold of the simulated data was equal to the model threshold, indicating no bias. The precision was improved with an increasing number of trials. Likewise, our data showed a similar bias and precision for a 2-AFC paradigm with 60 trials as for a 4-AFC paradigm with 30 trials. Trials in the 4-AFC paradigm took slightly longer as participants scanned more alternatives. However, the 4-AFC task still ended up faster for a given precision.Bias and precision were similar in a 4-AFC task compared to a 2-AFC task with double the number of trials. However, a 4-AFC paradigm was more time efficient and is therefore recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2885170917,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may serve as elegant tool to improve risk stratification in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV)-associated aortopathy. However, the exact pathogenetic pathway by which miRNAs impact aortopathy progression is unknown. Herewith, we aimed to analyze the association between circulating miRNAs and rare variants of aortopathy-related genes. 63 BAV patients (mean age 47.3±11.3 years, 92% male) with a root dilatation phenotype, who underwent aortic valve+/-proximal aortic surgery at a single institution (mean post-AVR follow-up 10.3±6.9 years) were analyzed. A custom-made HaloPlex HS panel including 20 aortopathy-related genes was used for the genetic testing. miRNAs were extracted from whole blood and miRNA analysis was performed using miRNA-specific assay. Study endpoint was the association between circulating miRNAs and rare genetic variants in the aortopathy gene panel. The study cohort was divided into a subgroup with rare variants vs. a subgroup without rare variants based on the presence of rare variants in the respective genes (i.e., at least one variant present). The genetic analysis yielded n = 6 potentially and likely pathogenic rare variants within the NOTCH1 gene as being the most common finding. Univariate analysis between blood miRNAs and NOTCH1 variants revealed a significantly lower expression of miR-145 in the subgroup of patients with NOTCH1 variants vs. those without NOTCH1 variants (i.e., delta Ct 4.95±0.74 vs. delta Ct 5.57±0.78, p = 0.04). Our preliminary data demonstrate a significant association between blood miR-145 expression and the presence of rare NOTCH1 variants. This association may be indicative of a specific pathogenetic pathway in the development of genetically-triggered bicuspid aortopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2883113120,"Root-knot nematodes (RKNs; Meloidogyne spp.) are obligate endoparasites that infect many crops and cause severe yield losses. In this research, we studied the effect of Welsh onion, grown as a companion plant, on the resistance of cucumber plants to RKN infection and analyzed the most abundant components of Welsh onion root exudates. The results showed that, when grown with Welsh onion as a companion plant, cucumber roots had 77.0% fewer root knots and egg masses than the control cucumber roots. Welsh onion root exudates were collected and extracted with chloroform, ethyl ether, n-butanol and ethyl acetate. High concentrations of the extracts from the Welsh onion root exudates decreased the hatchability of RKN eggs. In particular, the inhibitory effect of the n-butanol extract was significant and the hatchability of RKN eggs did not exceed 10%. Gas chromatographic–mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the most abundant component in the n-butanol extract was 4-hydroxy-benzeneethanol. Treatment with 1.2 mM 4-hydroxy-benzeneethanol decreased egg hatchability to 40%, whereas treatment with 9.6 mM or a higher concentration of 4-hydroxy-benzeneethanol decreased egg hatchability to less than 10%. In addition, 1.2 mM or a higher concentration of 4-hydroxy-benzeneethanol decreased the activity of the second-stage juvenile (J2). Higher 4-hydroxy-benzeneethanol concentrations (9.8 and 19.2 mM) were lethal to RKNs to some extent, with death rates greater than 50% at 48 h of treatment. The present results suggest that cultivation with Welsh onion as a companion plant may represent an alternative to the application of synthetic nematicides, with fewer side effects. We confirmed that 4-hydroxy-benzeneethanol is a natural effective nematicide."
https://openalex.org/W2886361977,"Background The present study aimed to test if the temporal sequence between sleep apnea (SA) diagnosis and incident myocardial infarction (MI) was associated with the long-term mortality and cardiovascular event in a community-based cohort. Methods We retrieved data from 9,453 incident MI patients between Jan. 1st 2000 and Dec. 31st 2012 from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The study subjects included 207 MI patients with SA (SA-MI), further stratified into 110 with pre-existing SA before MI (SA-bMI) and 96 diagnosed with SA after MI (SA-pMI). The median follow-up period was 4.2 years. Propensity-score-matched controls were selected from 9,246 non-SA MI patients (non-SA-MI). The association of SA and outcomes including all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) were analyzed by a Cox proportional hazards model. Results The result showed that SA was not associated with mortality regardless of the timing of SA diagnosis. SA-pMI was associated with increased risk of MACCEs (Hazard ratio [HR]: 1.412, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.037~1.923, p = 0.029) including re-MI or revascularization and ischemic heart disease hospitalization. Such an association was most significant for SA diagnosed within one year after MI (HR: 2.029, 95% CI: 1.265~3.254, p = 0.003), which was not seen in patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Conclusion The temporal sequence and the time interval between SA diagnosis and incident MI was associated with the cardiovascular events after MI, especially within one year after MI. Early assessment for the presence of SA after incident MI and early CPAP intervention may reduce the risk of further adverse cardiovascular events."
https://openalex.org/W2951624146,"The maintenance of behavioral change over the long term is essential to achieve public health goals such as combatting obesity and drug use. Previous work by our group has demonstrated a reliable shift in preferences for appetitive foods following a novel non-reinforced training paradigm. In the current studies, we tested whether distributing training trials over two consecutive days would affect preferences immediately after training as well as over time at a one-month follow-up. In four studies, three different designs and an additional pre-registered replication of one sample, we found that spacing of cue-approach training induced a shift in food choice preferences over one month. The spacing and massing schedule employed governed the long-term changes in choice behavior. Applying spacing strategies to training paradigms that target automatic processes could prove a useful tool for the long-term maintenance of health improvement goals with the development of real-world behavioral change paradigms that incorporate distributed practice principles."
https://openalex.org/W2884756670,"Selenium (Se) is an essential element in human and animal diets, based upon a widespread range of beneficial effects that are primarily due to its antioxidant properties. While Se can be associated to anti-cancer and anti-diabetic activities, reproductive efficiency, and enhancement of the immune system, the mechanistic details of the corresponding biological processes are still largely elusive. To avoid deficiencies and increase bioavailability, Se it is generally supplied to livestock through Se-supplemented feeds or forage plants fertilized with inorganic Se. While the relationship between Ca2+ and ROS (reactive oxygen species) is well known, only a few studies have addressed the possible involvement of Se in the control of cytosolic Ca2+ in oxidative stress. The results on Ca2+ homeostasis were obtained adding exogenous Se in the form of SeO42- to sheep lymphomonocytes cultured in vitro. In particular, Se strongly attenuated 1mM H2O2-induced alteration of intracellular [Ca2+]C as well as the entry of extracellular Ca2+ into the cells with comparable EC50 values for sodium selenate accounting to 1.72 and 2.28 mM, respectively. In an ex vivo trial, it was observed that Ca2+ homeostasis can effectively be rescued in sheep lymphomonocytes exposed in vivo to a Se concentration of approximately 1.9 mM, that was achieved by feeding sheep with olive leaves previously sprayed with 500 mg/plant Na-selenate. Thus the results obtained suggest that the mode of action of selenium markedly influenced Ca2+-related signaling events. Furthermore, results clearly reveal that the protective effect of Se on Ca2+ homeostasis under oxidative challenge can be clearly and effectively achieved through an appropriate dietary regimen obtained also in a circular economy logic using pruning of olive trees treated to reduce tree drought stress."
https://openalex.org/W2884240817,"Chemotaxis, the migration of cells in the direction of a chemical gradient, is of utmost importance in various biological processes. In recent years, research has demonstrated that the underlying mechanism that controls cell migration is an excitable network. One of the properties that characterizes excitability is the presence of a threshold for activation. Here, we show that excitable systems possess noise filtering capabilities that enable faster and more efficient directed migration compared to other systems that also include a threshold, such as ultrasensitive switches. We demonstrate that this filtering ability is a consequence of the varying responses of excitable systems to step and pulse stimuli. Whereas the response to step inputs is determined solely by the magnitude of the stimulus, for pulse stimuli, the response depends on both the magnitude and duration of the stimulus. We then show that these two forms of threshold behavior can be decoupled from one another, allowing finer control in chemotaxis. Finally, we use a simple model of chemotaxis to demonstrate that cells that rely on an excitable system display faster and more effective directed migration that a hypothetical cell guided by an ultra-sensitive switch."
https://openalex.org/W2886385311,"Positron emission tomography (PET) with radiolabelled peptide-based tracers has attracted great interest in oncology over the past decades. The success of imaging is closely related to sufficient uptake of the radiotracer in malignant tissue and for this sufficient biological half-life, particularly in the bloodstream, is mandatory. Fast enzymatic degradation during circulation leading to insufficient imaging abilities of peptide-based radioligands remains a major issue. The design of multimeric constructs, bearing multiple targeting moieties, has been widely applied to improve target interaction. This concept may also be applied to prolong the biological half-life of peptide-based radiopharmaceuticals as enzymatic degradation can result in formation of metabolites still capable to interact with the target binding site. In this study we aimed to identify such metabolites and therefore we utilized the siderophore-based bifunctional chelator fusarinine C (FSC) for the design of novel mono- and multimeric constructs, bearing minigastrin (MG) analogues as targeting moieties to address cholecystokinin-2 receptors (CCK2R) which are overexpressed in a variety of cancerous diseases and are well known for fast enzymatic degradation, particularly for truncated des-(Glu)5-MG members, such as MG11. FSC-based imaging probes were radiolabelled with gallium-68 and characterized in vitro (logD, protein binding, affinity and cell-uptake studies, stability and metabolite studies, as well as generation of corresponding metabolites by artificial enzymatic degradation) and in vivo (biodistribution in A431-CCK2R/A431-mock tumour xenografted BALB/c nude mice and stability in blood of living BALB/c mice and analysis of corresponding organ homogenates and urine to identify degradation products). In summary, multimerization was accompanied by partial improvement towards targeting abilities. Identified metabolites formed by artificial enzymatic cleavage of trimeric FSC-MG conjugates in vitro contained intact binding sequences for the receptor. Furthermore, the 68Ga-labelled trimers exhibiting increasing uptake of radioligand in tumour tissue over time and improved in vivo stability in blood samples of living animals of the trimers compared to corresponding mono- and dimers, strongly supporting our hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2883711206,"Background American cockroaches (Periplaneta americana) are an important indoor allergen source and a major risk factor for exacerbations and poor control of asthma. We previously reported that allergen components from American cockroaches exhibit varying levels of pathogenicity. Sensitization to major American cockroach allergen, Per a 2, correlated with more severe clinical phenotypes among patients with allergic airway diseases. Materials and methods In this study, we examined whether oral plant vaccine-encoding full-length Per a 2 clone-996 or its hypoallergenic clone-372 could exert a prophylactic role in Per a 2-sensitized mice. The cDNAs coding Per a 2–996 and Per a 2–372 were inserted into TuMV vector and expressed in Chinese cabbage. Adult female BALB/c mice were fed with the cabbage extracts for 21 days and subsequently underwent two-step sensitization with recombinant Per a 2. Results Per a 2-specific IgE measured by in-house ELISA in the sera of Per a 2-372-treated groups were significantly lower than in the control groups after allergen challenge but not the Per a 2-996-treated group. Moreover, Per a 2–372 vaccine markedly decreased airway hyper-responsiveness and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lungs, as well as reduced mRNA expression of IL-4 and IL-13 in comparison with the control mice. Conclusion Our data suggest that oral administration of edible plant vaccine encoding Per a 2 hypo-allergen may be used as a prophylactic strategy against the development of cockroach allergy."
https://openalex.org/W2883780802,"Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) is a first-principles based method for studying macromolecules and particles in solution by monitoring the evolution of their radial concentration distribution as a function of time in the presence of a high centrifugal field. In sedimentation velocity experiments, hydrodynamic properties relating to size, shape, density, and solvation of particles can be measured, at a high hydrodynamic resolution, on polydisperse samples. In a recent multilaboratory benchmark study including data from commercial analytical ultracentrifuges in 67 laboratories, the calibration accuracy of the radial dimension was found to be one of the dominant factors limiting the accuracy of AUC. In the present work, we develop an artifact consisting of an accurately calibrated reflective pattern lithographically deposited onto an AUC window. It serves as a reticle when scanned in AUC control experiments for absolute calibration of radial magnification. After analysis of the pitch between landmarks in scans using different optical systems, we estimate that the residual uncertainty in radial magnification after external calibration with the radial scale artifact is ≈0.2 %, of similar magnitude to other important contributions after external calibration such as the uncertainty in temperature and time. The previous multilaboratory study had found many instruments with errors in radial measurements of 1 % to 2 %, and a few instruments with errors in excess of 15 %, meaning that the use of the artifact developed here could reduce errors by 5-to 10-fold or more. Adoption of external radial calibration is thus an important factor for assuring accuracy in studies related to molecular hydrodynamics and particle size measurements by AUC."
https://openalex.org/W2884486789,"Background The enzymes involved in de novo purine synthesis (DNPS), one of the basic processes in eukaryotic cells, transiently and reversibly form a dynamic multienzyme complex called the purinosome in the cytoplasm. The purinosome has been observed in a broad spectrum of cells, but some studies claim that it is an artefact of the constructs used for visualization or stress granules resulting from the exposure of cells to nutrient-reduced growth media. Both may be true depending on the method of observation. To clarify this point, we combined two previously used methods, transfection and immunofluorescence, to detect purinosomes in purinosome-free cells deficient in particular DNPS steps (CR-DNPS cells) and in cells deficient in the salvage pathway, which resulted in construction of the purinosome regardless of purine level (CR-HGPRT cells). Methods and findings To restore or disrupt purinosome formation, we transiently transfected CR-DNPS and CR-HGPRT cells with vectors encoding BFP-labelled wild-type (wt) proteins and observed the normalization of purinosome formation. The cells also ceased to accumulate the substrate(s) of the defective enzyme. The CR-DNPS cell line transfected with a DNA plasmid encoding an enzyme with zero activity served as a negative control for purinosome formation. No purinosome formation was observed in these cells regardless of the purine level in the growth medium. Conclusion In conclusion, both methods are useful for the detection of purinosomes in HeLa cells. Moreover, the cell-based models prepared represent a unique system for the study of purinosome assembly with deficiencies in DNPS or in the salvage pathway as well as for the study of purinosome formation under the action of DNPS inhibitors. This approach is a promising step toward the treatment of purine disorders and can also provide targets for anticancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2887938527,"Background Hip screening is the standard approach for the early detection of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the effects of national policy on early diagnosis and later surgical incidence. The purpose of this national study is to estimate DDH incidence in the Taiwanese population through a new diagnosis definition and to examine whether a health promotion policy could reduce surgeries for DDH. Methods and results Six birth-year cohorts (2000–2005) were evaluated for DDH diagnosis and related surgeries using the database of the National Health Insurance Administration, which covers 99% of the population of Taiwan. Children with three or more sequential International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes (754.3x) in the outpatient claim file or DDH-related surgeries were studied. The outcome of hip screening was evaluated with the ratio of early diagnosis (0–6 months) to late diagnosis (1–5 years) and the incidence of major surgeries for DDH. DDH incidence was 1.54 per thousand live births (2,255/1,462,539). After a hip screening promotion policy was implemented in 2002, ratios of early/late diagnosis increased from 1.06, 1.25, 1.38, and 1.5 to 1.75 for the years 2000 to 2005, respectively. Incidences of major surgery decreased from 0.41–0.47 per thousand before policy administration to 0.33–0.37 per thousand after policy administration. Discussion The DDH incidence of 1.54 per 1,000 in a geographically well-defined area offered epidemiological data for further studies in Asian populations. The results suggest that the health promotion policy is associated with an increase in early diagnosis and subsequently a decrease in surgeries for DDH."

To allow for productive discussion, equine professionals (n = 34) chosen to represent the diverse specializations from across Canada were surveyed using the Delphi technique-a survey technique employing multiple, iterative ""rounds"" to consolidate viewpoints-to gather and consolidate information regarding areas of welfare concern in the Canadian equine industry. Only participants who completed the prior round could participate in subsequent rounds. In the first round, respondents were asked to identify examples of welfare issues. Qualitative analysis was used to sort and group answers based on their similarities. Participants identified 12 welfare issues best addressed at the individual horse level, and an additional 12 welfare issues best addressed at the industry level. In the second (n = 24) and third (n = 14) rounds, welfare issues, solutions, and potential motives were consolidated based on order ranking. Themes of ""ignorance"" and ""lack of knowledge"" identified throughout all three rounds were cited as both potential risks to welfare as well as motives leading to poor welfare situations. Responses in this study suggest that in order to improve the welfare of equids in the Canadian industry, equine professionals propose that a greater effort is required to help educate industry members and stakeholders such that, through daily routine care and management, higher standards of welfare can be attained."

However, the milk yield of the yak is very much lower compared with other dairy bovines. To understand the molecular mechanisms of lactogenesis, lactation and mammary gland development, mammary tissue samples were taken from five yaks during a dry period (DP, n = 3) and lactation period (LP, n = 2). Two types of cDNA sequence libraries that reflected the different physiological states of the mammary gland were constructed using RNA sequencing technology. After removing reads containing adapters, reads containing poly-N and low-quality reads from the raw data, 45,423,478 to 53,274,976 clean reads were obtained from these libraries. A total of 74.72% to 80.65% of the high-quality sequence reads were uniquely aligned to the BosGru v2.0 yak reference genome. Using the DESeq R package, 360 differentially expressed genes were detected between the two groups when the adjusted P value (padj < 0.05) was used as the cutoff value; this included 192 upregulated and 168 downregulated genes in the yak mammary gland tissue of the DP compared to the LP. A gene ontology analysis revealed that the most enriched GO terms were protein binding, multi-organism process, immune system and others. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the differentially expressed genes were mostly enriched in Hippo signaling, insulin signaling, steroid biosynthesis and others. The analysis of the up- and downregulated genes provides important insights into the molecular events involved in lactogenesis, lactation and mammary gland development and will guide further research to enhance milk yield and optimize the constituents of yak milk."

Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is used to detoxify users of illicit opiates, but drug relapse is common and associated with poor quality of life (QoL). This study investigated the associations between the GRIN3A, GRM6, and TPH2 genetic variants and QoL in the MMT population. A total of 319 participants were included in the study, and genotyping of GRIN3A, GRM6, and TPH2 genes was performed using the Sequenom iPLEX. Associations between genotypes and the domains of QoL were examined through posthoc analysis with LSMEANS syntax using SAS 9.1.3. The single nucleotide polymorphisms rs9325202 and rs1487275 in the TPH2 gene were significantly associated with the QoL domain of physical functioning. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model revealed that the risk allele rs1487275-G was significantly correlated with the domain of physical functioning when clinical characteristics were considered as covariates. The results of the present study illuminate the importance of the genetic basis of QoL in the MMT population, and suggest that genotypes should be considered as a potential QoL indicator."
https://openalex.org/W2886729679,"Background Calcium gradient, the difference between serum calcium and dialysate calcium d[Ca], is the main contributor factor influencing calcium transfer during hemodialysis. The impact, however, of bone turnover, on calcium mass transfer during hemodialysis is still uncertain. Methods This prospective cross-sectional study included 10 patients on hemodialysis for a 57.6±16.8 months, with severe hyperparathyroidism. Patients were submitted to 3 hemodialysis sessions using d[Ca] of 1.25, 1.5 and 1.75 mmol/l in three situations: pre-parathyroidectomy (pre-PTX), during hungry bone (early post-PTX), and after stabilization of clinical status (late post-PTX). Biochemical analysis and calcium mass transfer were evaluated and serum bone-related proteins were quantified. Results Calcium mass transfer varied widely among patients in each study phase with a median of -89.5, -76.8 and -3 mmol using d[Ca] 1.25 mmol/L, -106, -26.8 and 29.7 mmol using d[Ca] 1.50 mmol/L, and 12.8, -14.5 and 38 mmol using d[Ca] 1.75 mmol/L during pre-PTX, early post-PTX and late post-PTX, respectively, which was significantly different among d[Ca] (p = 0.0001) and among phases (p = 0.040). Ca gradient and delta of Ca also differed among d[Ca] and phases (p<0.05 for all comparisons), whether ultrafiltration was similar. Serum Osteocalcin decreased significantly in late post-PTX, whereas Sclerostin increased earlier, in early post-PTX. Conclusions The skeleton plays a key role in Ca mass transfer during dialysis, either by determining pre-dialysis serum Ca or by controlling the exchangeable Ca pool. Knowing that could help us to decide which d[Ca] should be chosen in a given patient."

Crohn's disease patients from several tertiary hospitals in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, were recruited to participate through purposive sampling combined with maximum variation and the snowballing technique. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analyzed using the conventional content analysis method.A total of 11 Crohn's disease patients were interviewed. Four themes and eight subthemes emerged from the analysis: rejecting the self-administration of nasogastric feeding (being afraid of inserting the nasogastric tube, having concerns about nasogastric feeding), accepting the reality of nasogastric feeding (health being the most important, followed by having sources of support), nasogastric feeding as a double-edged sword (the disturbances and efficacies of nasogastric feeding), and nasogastric feeding as a part of life (becoming accustomed to tube insertion and taking nasogastric feeding for granted).Apart from suffering from physical discomfort, diet and body image disturbances, and inconveniences in daily life, Crohn's disease patients who self-administered nasogastric feeding faced many psychological challenges. Many of these patients eventually adjusted to a life with nasogastric feeding, but not everyone achieved this state. Therefore, health care providers, including physicians and nurses, and the general public should collaborate to help these patients adapt to their ""new lives"" as soon as possible."
https://openalex.org/W2886632844,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) [Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)], are chronic relapsing disorders of unknown etiology. The aim of this study was to determine demographic features, disease phenotypes, medical and surgical therapies in our IBD patients and to identify which parameters are in association with the need of surgery and/or biologic therapy. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were analyzed from the IBD registry of the 1st Department of Medicine, University of Szeged. The study period was between January 2007 and March 2015. Data of 911 IBD patients (428 CD, 483 UC) were analyzed. The median lag time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis proved to be significantly longer in UC than in CD (4.6 years vs. 2.1 years, p = 0.01). 40% of the patients received biological therapy, 301 patients underwent surgery required more frequently for CD than UC. Surgery was more common in CD patients with ileal location and penetrating behaviour. In UC, more severe disease onset predicted to unfavourable disease course. Higher proportion of surgery was shown in patient aged above 40 years in both CD and UC. Diagnostic delay of more than 1 year and appendectomy predicted to unfavourable disease outcome of both CD and UC. This analysis revealed that more than 1 year of diagnostic delay, disease activity at diagnosis in UC, CD, ileal location and penetrating behaviour are factors that may influence disease outcome. Use of thiopurines seemed to be protective in UC."
https://openalex.org/W2887518904,"Pain and inflammation are complex clinical conditions that are present in a wide variety of disorders. Most drugs used to treat pain and inflammation have potential side effects, which makes it necessary to search for new sources of bioactive molecules. In this paper, we describe the ability of LASSBio-1586, an N-acylhydrazone derivative, to attenuate nociceptive behavior and the inflammatory response in mice. Antinociceptive activity was evaluated through acetic acid-induced writhing and formalin-induced nociception tests. In these experimental models, LASSBio-1586 significantly (p<0.05) reduced nociceptive behavior. Several methods of acute and chronic inflammation induced by different chemical (carrageenan, histamine, croton oil, arachidonic acid) and physical (cotton pellet) agents were used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of LASSBio-1586. LASSBio-1586 exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activity in all tests (p<0.05). Study of the mechanism of action demonstrated the possible involvement of the nitrergic, serotonergic and histamine signaling pathways. In addition, a molecular docking study was performed, indicating that LASSBio-1586 is able to block the COX-2 enzyme, reducing arachidonic acid metabolism and consequently decreasing the production of prostaglandins, which are important inflammatory mediators. In summary, LASSBio-1586 exhibited relevant antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory potential and acted on several targets, making it a candidate for a new multi-target oral anti-inflammatory drug."
https://openalex.org/W2887842196,"Pleural infection/empyema is common and its incidence continues to rise. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the commonest bacterial cause of empyema in children and among the commonest in adults. The mesothelium represents the first line of defense against invading microorganisms, but mesothelial cell responses to common empyema pathogens, including S. pneumoniae, have seldom been studied. We assessed mesothelial cell viability in vitro following exposure to common empyema pathogens. Clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae from 25 patients with invasive pneumococcal disease and three reference strains were tested. All potently induced death of cultured mesothelial cells (MeT-5A) in a dose- and time-dependent manner (>90% at 107 CFU/mL after 24 hours). No significant mesothelial cell killing was observed when cells were co-cultured with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus milleri group bacteria. S. pneumoniae induced mesothelial cell death via secretory product(s) as cytotoxicity could be: i) reproduced using conditioned media derived from S. pneumoniae and ii) in transwell studies when the bacteria and mesothelial cells were separated. No excess cell death was seen when heat-killed S. pneumoniae were used. Pneumolysin, a cytolytic S. pneumoniae toxin, induced cell death in a time- and dose-dependent manner. S. pneumoniae lacking the pneumolysin gene (D39 ΔPLY strain) failed to kill mesothelial cells compared to wild type (D39) controls, confirming the necessity of pneumolysin in D39-induced mesothelial cell death. However, pneumolysin gene mutation in other S. pneumoniae strains (TIGR4, ST3 and ST23F) only partly abolished their cytotoxic effects, suggesting different strains may induce cell death via different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2887864977,"Heart Failure (HF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are morbid diseases that often coexist. In patients with coexisting disease, COPD is an independent risk factor for readmission and mortality. However, spirometry is often inaccurate in those with active heart failure. Therefore, we investigated the association between the presence of emphysema on computed tomography (CT) and readmission rates in smokers admitted with heart failure (HF). The cohort included a consecutive group of smokers discharged with HF from a tertiary center between January 1, 2014 and April 1, 2014 who also had a CT of the chest for dyspnea. The primary endpoint was any readmission for HF before April 1, 2016; secondary endpoints were 30-day readmission for HF, length of stay and all-cause mortality. Over the study period, there were 225 inpatient smokers with HF who had a concurrent chest CT (155 [69%] males, age 69±11 years, ejection fraction [EF] 46±18%, 107 [48%] LVEF of < 50%). Emphysema on CT was present in 103 (46%) and these were older, had a lower BMI, more pack-years, less diabetes and an increased afterload. During a follow-up of 2.1 years, there were 110 (49%) HF readmissions and 55 (24%) deaths. When separated by emphysema on CT, any readmission, 30-day readmission, length of stay and mortality were higher among HF patients with emphysema. In multivariable regression, emphysema by CT was associated with a two-fold higher (adjusted HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.41–3.15, p < 0.001) risk of readmission and a trend toward increased mortality (adjusted HR 1.70 95% CI 0.86–3.34, p = 0.12). In conclusion, emphysema by CT is a frequent finding in smokers hospitalized with HF and is associated with adverse outcomes in HF. This under recognized group of patients with both emphysema and heart failure may benefit from improved recognition and characterization of their co-morbid disease processes and optimization of therapies for their lung disease."

https://openalex.org/W2887944830,"Knowledge about the population size and trends of common bird species is crucial for setting conservation priorities and management actions. Multi-species large-scale monitoring schemes have often provided such estimates relying on extrapolation of relative abundances in particular habitats to large-scale areas. Here we show an alternative to inference-rich predictive models, proposing methods to deal with caveats of population size estimations in habitat-specialist species, reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus and Acrocephalus arundinaceus). Reed warblers were only found in pure reedbeds within riparian woodlands or in riparian vegetation scattered within or around reedbed patches, as expected according to their habitat specialization. The proportion of individuals located in reedbed associated with lotic and lentic waters differed between species, and no reed warbler was recorded in reedbed located along dry streams. This indicates that microhabitat features or their effects on reedbed structure and other factors made a proportion of the apparently available habitat unsuitable for both warbler species. Most warblers detected were males performing territorial singing (females seldom sing and do not perform elaborate territorial song, and are undistinguishable from males by plumage). The regional population sizes of the warbler species (~4000 individuals of A. scirpaceus and ~ 1000 individuals of A. arundinaceus) were much smaller than those estimated for the same area by transforming relative abundance obtained at a national scale to population size through extrapolation by habitat at a regional scale. These results highlight the importance of considering the habitat actually used and its suitability, the manner of sex-related detection, population sex-ratio and their interactions in population estimates. Ideally, the value of predictive methods to estimate population size of common species should be tested before conducting large-scale monitoring, rather than a posteriori. Although logistically challenging, this can be achieved by designing monitoring programs including an intensive sampling of abundance in ad hoc reference areas of variable size."
https://openalex.org/W2886434092,"Because collagen type V (Col V) can be exposed in tissue injury, we hypothesized that oral administration of this collagen species modulates the inflammation and remodeling of experimental synovitis, avoiding joint destruction, and that the modulation may differ according to the temporal administration. Arthritis (IA, n = 20) was induced in Lewis rats by intraarticular (ia) injection of 500 μg of methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA) emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) (10 μl) followed by an intraarticular booster of mBSA (50 μg) in saline (50 μl) administered at 7 and 14 days. The control group received saline (50 μl, ia). After the first intraarticular injection, ten IA animals were supplemented via gavage with Col V (500 μg/300 μl) daily for 30 days (IA/Suppl). The control group received saline (50 μL) and Col V supplement in the same way (Suppl). Col V oral administration in IA/Suppl led to 1) inhibited edema and severe inflammatory cell infiltration, 2) decreased collagen fiber content, 3) decreased collagen type I, 4) inhibited lymphocyte subpopulations and macrophages, 5) inhibited IL-1β, IL-10, IL-17 and TNF-α production and 6) increased expression of caspase-9 in the synovial tissue. In conclusion, Col V supplementation decreased synovial inflammation and the fibrotic response, possibly by increased the apoptosis of inflammatory cells."
https://openalex.org/W2887066170,"In two experiments, we examined the functional locus of plural dominance in the French spoken word production system, where singulars and plurals share the same phonological word form. The materials included singular-dominant (singular more frequent than plural) and plural-dominant nouns (plural more frequent than singular). In Experiment 1, participants were instructed to produce determiner-noun phrases in response to singular and plural depictions of objects. In contrast to the dominance-by-number interaction that is typically observed in English, Dutch and German, the French picture-naming data revealed a main effect of number, but no effect of plural dominance. When participants were instructed to produce determiner-noun phrases in a reading aloud task (Experiment 2), where number is orthographically marked, a number-by-dominance interaction emerged. Our data suggest that plural dominance is encoded at the word form level within the context of recent theories of spoken word production."
