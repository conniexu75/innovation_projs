https://openalex.org/W2068127752,"Jessica Zucman-Rossi and colleagues report exome sequencing of 24 hepatocellular carcinomas and non-tumor liver tissues and copy-number analysis of 125 tumors. They identify new recurrent mutations in ARID1A, RPS6KA3, NFE2L2 and IRF2 in HCC. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy. Here, we performed high-resolution copy-number analysis on 125 HCC tumors and whole-exome sequencing on 24 of these tumors. We identified 135 homozygous deletions and 994 somatic mutations of genes with predicted functional consequences. We found new recurrent alterations in four genes (ARID1A, RPS6KA3, NFE2L2 and IRF2) not previously described in HCC. Functional analyses showed tumor suppressor properties for IRF2, whose inactivation, exclusively found in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related tumors, led to impaired TP53 function. In contrast, inactivation of chromatin remodelers was frequent and predominant in alcohol-related tumors. Moreover, association of mutations in specific genes (RPS6KA3-AXIN1 and NFE2L2-CTNNB1) suggested that Wnt/β-catenin signaling might cooperate in liver carcinogenesis with both oxidative stress metabolism and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. This study provides insight into the somatic mutational landscape in HCC and identifies interactions between mutations in oncogene and tumor suppressor gene mutations related to specific risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W1974554864,"This study uses a new analysis method for magnetoencephalography measurements of the human brain to show brain-wide and frequency-specific functional coupling of spontaneous oscillatory activities during resting state. Little is known about the brain-wide correlation of electrophysiological signals. We found that spontaneous oscillatory neuronal activity exhibited frequency-specific spatial correlation structure in the human brain. We developed an analysis approach that discounts spurious correlation of signal power caused by the limited spatial resolution of electrophysiological measures. We applied this approach to source estimates of spontaneous neuronal activity reconstructed from magnetoencephalography. Overall, correlation of power across cortical regions was strongest in the alpha to beta frequency range (8–32 Hz) and correlation patterns depended on the underlying oscillation frequency. Global hubs resided in the medial temporal lobe in the theta frequency range (4–6 Hz), in lateral parietal areas in the alpha to beta frequency range (8–23 Hz) and in sensorimotor areas for higher frequencies (32–45 Hz). Our data suggest that interactions in various large-scale cortical networks may be reflected in frequency-specific power envelope correlations."

They show that the frequency of such events increases with age and is associated with elevated risk of developing subsequent hematological cancers. In an analysis of 31,717 cancer cases and 26,136 cancer-free controls from 13 genome-wide association studies, we observed large chromosomal abnormalities in a subset of clones in DNA obtained from blood or buccal samples. We observed mosaic abnormalities, either aneuploidy or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity, of >2 Mb in size in autosomes of 517 individuals (0.89%), with abnormal cell proportions of between 7% and 95%. In cancer-free individuals, frequency increased with age, from 0.23% under 50 years to 1.91% between 75 and 79 years (P = 4.8 × 10−8). Mosaic abnormalities were more frequent in individuals with solid tumors (0.97% versus 0.74% in cancer-free individuals; odds ratio (OR) = 1.25; P = 0.016), with stronger association with cases who had DNA collected before diagnosis or treatment (OR = 1.45; P = 0.0005). Detectable mosaicism was also more common in individuals for whom DNA was collected at least 1 year before diagnosis with leukemia compared to cancer-free individuals (OR = 35.4; P = 3.8 × 10−11). These findings underscore the time-dependent nature of somatic events in the etiology of cancer and potentially other late-onset diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2133920348,"We detected clonal mosaicism for large chromosomal anomalies (duplications, deletions and uniparental disomy) using SNP microarray data from over 50,000 subjects recruited for genome-wide association studies. This detection method requires a relatively high frequency of cells with the same abnormal karyotype (>5-10%; presumably of clonal origin) in the presence of normal cells. The frequency of detectable clonal mosaicism in peripheral blood is low (<0.5%) from birth until 50 years of age, after which it rapidly rises to 2-3% in the elderly. Many of the mosaic anomalies are characteristic of those found in hematological cancers and identify common deleted regions with genes previously associated with these cancers. Although only 3% of subjects with detectable clonal mosaicism had any record of hematological cancer before DNA sampling, those without a previous diagnosis have an estimated tenfold higher risk of a subsequent hematological cancer (95% confidence interval = 6-18)."

https://openalex.org/W2045024858,"The decline in hematopoietic function seen during aging involves a progressive reduction in the immune response and an increased incidence of myeloid malignancy, and has been linked to aging of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The molecular mechanisms underlying HSC aging remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that elevated activity of the small RhoGTPase Cdc42 in aged HSCs is causally linked to HSC aging and correlates with a loss of polarity in aged HSCs. Pharmacological inhibition of Cdc42 activity functionally rejuvenates aged HSCs, increases the percentage of polarized cells in an aged HSC population, and restores the level and spatial distribution of histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation to a status similar to that seen in young HSCs. Our data therefore suggest a mechanistic role for Cdc42 activity in HSC biology and epigenetic regulation, and identify Cdc42 activity as a pharmacological target for ameliorating stem cell aging."
https://openalex.org/W1990897270,"A major obstacle in the application of cell-based therapies for the treatment of neuromuscular disorders is obtaining the appropriate number of stem/progenitor cells to produce effective engraftment. The use of embryonic stem (ES) or induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells could overcome this hurdle. However, to date, derivation of engraftable skeletal muscle precursors that can restore muscle function from human pluripotent cells has not been achieved. Here we applied conditional expression of PAX7 in human ES/iPS cells to successfully derive large quantities of myogenic precursors, which, upon transplantation into dystrophic muscle, are able to engraft efficiently, producing abundant human-derived DYSTROPHIN-positive myofibers that exhibit superior strength. Importantly, transplanted cells also seed the muscle satellite cell compartment, and engraftment is present over 11 months posttransplant. This study provides the proof of principle for the derivation of functional skeletal myogenic progenitors from human ES/iPS cells and highlights their potential for future therapeutic application in muscular dystrophies."
https://openalex.org/W2167181815,"Structural genomic variations represent a major driving force of evolution, and a burst of large segmental gene duplications occurred in the human lineage during its separation from nonhuman primates. SRGAP2, a gene recently implicated in neocortical development, has undergone two human-specific duplications. Here, we find that both duplications (SRGAP2B and SRGAP2C) are partial and encode a truncated F-BAR domain. SRGAP2C is expressed in the developing and adult human brain and dimerizes with ancestral SRGAP2 to inhibit its function. In the mouse neocortex, SRGAP2 promotes spine maturation and limits spine density. Expression of SRGAP2C phenocopies SRGAP2 deficiency. It underlies sustained radial migration and leads to the emergence of human-specific features, including neoteny during spine maturation and increased density of longer spines. These results suggest that inhibition of SRGAP2 function by its human-specific paralogs has contributed to the evolution of the human neocortex and plays an important role during human brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2152627215,"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are potential sources of cells for modeling disease and development, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine. However, it is important to identify factors that may impact the utility of hPSCs for these applications. In an unbiased analysis of 205 hPSC and 130 somatic samples, we identified hPSC-specific epigenetic and transcriptional aberrations in genes subject to X chromosome inactivation (XCI) and genomic imprinting, which were not corrected during directed differentiation. We also found that specific tissue types were distinguished by unique patterns of DNA hypomethylation, which were recapitulated by DNA demethylation during in vitro directed differentiation. Our results suggest that verification of baseline epigenetic status is critical for hPSC-based disease models in which the observed phenotype depends on proper XCI or imprinting and that tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns can be accurately modeled during directed differentiation of hPSCs, even in the presence of variations in XCI or imprinting."
https://openalex.org/W2043302270,"Surveys of 16S rDNA sequences from the honey bee, Apis mellifera, have revealed the presence of eight distinctive bacterial phylotypes in intestinal tracts of adult worker bees. Because previous studies have been limited to relatively few sequences from samples pooled from multiple hosts, the extent of variation in this microbiota among individuals within and between colonies and locations has been unclear. We surveyed the gut microbiota of 40 individual workers from two sites, Arizona and Maryland USA, sampling four colonies per site. Universal primers were used to amplify regions of 16S ribosomal RNA genes, and amplicons were sequenced using 454 pyrotag methods, enabling analysis of about 330,000 bacterial reads. Over 99% of these sequences belonged to clusters for which the first blastn hits in GenBank were members of the known bee phylotypes. Four phylotypes, one within Gammaproteobacteria (corresponding to ""Candidatus Gilliamella apicola"") one within Betaproteobacteria (""Candidatus Snodgrassella alvi""), and two within Lactobacillus, were present in every bee, though their frequencies varied. The same typical bacterial phylotypes were present in all colonies and at both sites. Community profiles differed significantly among colonies and between sites, mostly due to the presence in some Arizona colonies of two species of Enterobacteriaceae not retrieved previously from bees. Analysis of Sanger sequences of rRNA of the Snodgrassella and Gilliamella phylotypes revealed that single bees contain numerous distinct strains of each phylotype. Strains showed some differentiation between localities, especially for the Snodgrassella phylotype."
https://openalex.org/W2030509917,"Calorie restriction (CR) extends life span and ameliorates age-related pathologies in most species studied, yet the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Using mouse skeletal muscle as a model, we show that CR acts in part by enhancing the function of tissue-specific stem cells. Even short-term CR significantly enhanced stem cell availability and activity in the muscle of young and old animals, in concert with an increase in mitochondrial abundance and induction of conserved metabolic and longevity regulators. Moreover, CR enhanced endogenous muscle repair and CR initiated in either donor or recipient animals improved the contribution of donor cells to regenerating muscle after transplant. These studies indicate that metabolic factors play a critical role in regulating stem cell function and that this regulation can influence the efficacy of recovery from injury and the engraftment of transplanted cells.

Indeed, age-matched animals maintained on a reduced-calorie diet throughout life show fewer malignancies, enhanced cognitive and motor function, and a lower incidence of diabetes, as compared to control animals allowed food ad libitum. Prior studies in the rodent hematopoietic system (Ertl et al., 2008Ertl R.P. Chen J. Astle C.M. Duffy T.M. Harrison D.E. Effects of dietary restriction on hematopoietic stem-cell aging are genetically regulated.Blood. 2008; 111: 1709-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) suggest that lifelong calorie restriction may maintain stem cell function, which normally declines with age, but whether short-term CR in otherwise healthy young animals might enhance the function of tissue stem cells has not been addressed. Moreover, the effect of CR in recipient animals on the efficiency of stem cell engraftment remains unknown. Answers to both of these questions may help to improve the targeting and transplant of stem cells for therapy and illuminate normal metabolic regulators of tissue stem cell function and the age-related factors that typically impair this function (Rossi et al., 2008Rossi D.J. Jamieson C.H. Weissman I.L. Stems cells and the pathways to aging and cancer.Cell. 2008; 132: 681-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of short-term CR on tissue stem cell activity, we focused on skeletal muscle, a well-characterized tissue that normally undergoes robust repair in response to injury. Muscle regenerative activity is mediated by a specialized population of precursor cells known as satellite cells (Mauro, 1961Mauro A. Satellite cell of skeletal muscle fibers.J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1961; 9: 493-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (2697) Google Scholar), which reside adjacent to myofibers. Satellite cells are activated by muscle injury to divide and differentiate, regenerating damaged tissue and restoring muscle function (reviewed in Wagers and Conboy, 2005Wagers A.J. Conboy I.M.

The satellite cell pool contains self-renewing muscle stem cells, which can be isolated using antibody staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). A number of different marker combinations have been used for satellite cell isolation (Kuang et al., 2007Kuang S. Kuroda K. Le Grand F.

Thus, CD45−Sca1−Mac1−CXCR4+β1-integrin+ cells display phenotypic and functional properties consistent with a highly enriched population of adult muscle satellite cells. To examine the effect of CR on the overall frequency and myogenic activity of skeletal muscle stem cells, we purified these cells from young C57BL/6 mice, raised initially on control diet and then switched to CR at 2 months of age, or from aged C57BL/6 mice in which CR was initiated at 18 months of age. In both cases, after 12 weeks of CR (1 week at 20% restriction and 11 weeks at 40% (Figure S1A), animals were sacrificed for FACS analysis and myogenesis assays to compare the frequency and activity of satellite cells in their muscles with those of age-matched controls. Strikingly, both young and aged animals (now at 5 or 21 months of age, respectively) exposed to short-term CR showed significantly increased frequencies (Figures 1A and 1B and S2A and S2B) of Pax7-expressing (Figure 1D) satellite cells as detected by FACS analysis. The total yield of satellite cells (per gram of muscle harvested) that could be recovered after cell sorting was also increased for CR muscle (Figures 1C and S2C). These CR-induced increases in satellite cell frequency were confirmed by staining for Pax7+ nuclei on isolated myofibers, which demonstrated an ∼3-fold increase in the number of Pax7+ cells per myofiber in young mice (n = 4, Figure 1F) and an ∼2-fold increase in aged mice (n = 4, Figure S2E). Satellite cells from CR-treated animals also exhibited significantly enhanced myogenic function in ex vivo colony forming assays (∼50%–60% increase in the number of cells capable of initiating myogenic colony formation, n = 7 [young] or n = 4 [aged]; Figures 1G and S2F). In both young and aged CR-treated mice, this enhanced myogenic function was accompanied by an increased fraction of satellite cells expressing the conserved longevity/metabolic regulators Sirt1 and Foxo3a (Figures 1K and S2G). In addition, CR-treated satellite cells in aged mice specifically, exhibited restoration of activation-induced Notch signaling (Figure S2G), a critical age-regulated determinant of myogenic function (Conboy et al., 2005Conboy I.M. Conboy M.J. Wagers A.J. Girma E.R. Weissman I.L. Rando T.A. Rejuvenation of aged progenitor cells by exposure to a young systemic environment.Nature. 2005; 433: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar, Conboy and Rando, 2002Conboy I.M. Rando T.A. The regulation of Notch signaling controls satellite cell activation and cell fate determination in postnatal myogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Thus, short-term CR, initiated either in youth or in old age, exerts a profound effect on muscle stem cells, altering their gene expression profile, enhancing their endogenous availability, and promoting their myogenic activity. Given that skeletal muscle of CR-treated animals typically shows increases in fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial energy production (Anderson and Weindruch, 2010Anderson R.M. Weindruch R. Metabolic reprogramming, caloric restriction and aging.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; 21: 134-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the mechanism by which CR increases satellite cell colony-forming capacity might relate to alterations in mitochondrial bioenergetics. To test this notion, we produced similar metabolic reprogramming in vitro by culturing satellite cells from control animals in media containing galactose instead of glucose, thereby forcing the cultured cells to utilize mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for energy production (Marroquin et al., 2007Marroquin L.D. Hynes J. Dykens J.A. Jamieson J.D. Will Y. Circumventing the Crabtree effect: replacing media glucose with galactose increases susceptibility of HepG2 cells to mitochondrial toxicants.Toxicol. Sci. 2007; 97: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Galactose culture of satellite cells from control fed mice significantly enhanced myogenic colony formation, and this increase in myogenic activity was blocked in the presence of etomoxir (Figure 1H), a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (Baht and Saggerson, 1989Baht H.S. Saggerson E.D. Effect of noradrenaline on triacylglycerol synthesis in rat brown adipocytes.Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In addition, comparison of the overall function of mitochondria in satellite cells from control and CR-treated mice revealed a significant increase in oxygen consumption rate in CR-treated satellite cells (Figure 1J). Conversely, glycolytic lactate production was dramatically decreased in CR satellite cells (Figure 1J), suggesting that under CR, satellite cells rely more on oxidative phosphorylation than glycolysis for energy production. Finally, immunofluorescence staining for mitochondria (Figure 1I) and western blotting for mitochondrial proteins (Figure 1L) revealed an increase in mitochondrial abundance in satellite cells from CR mice. Thus, consistent with reports on CR-induced metabolic reprogramming in whole organs (reviewed in Anderson and Weindruch, 2010Anderson R.M. Weindruch R. Metabolic reprogramming, caloric restriction and aging.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; 21: 134-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), CR induces in satellite cells substantial alterations in mitochondrial mass and function, which promote oxidative metabolism. Moreover, an in vitro intervention (galactose) that likewise enhances mitochondrial energy production recapitulates the beneficial effects of CR on satellite cells, implicating modulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics as a likely mechanism by which CR enhances satellite cell frequency and activity in skeletal muscle. The increased frequency and function of satellite cells within the muscle of CR-treated animals suggests that this simple dietary intervention may hold promise for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of muscle stem cells in the context of muscle disease or dysfunction. To test this possibility, we analyzed the regenerative activity after injury of endogenous satellite cells in CR or control mice, and the engraftment potential of donor satellite cells harvested from short-term CR or control fed mice and transplanted into the muscles of recipient mdx mice, a well-studied model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Sicinski et al., 1989Sicinski P. Geng Y. Ryder-Cook A.S. Barnard E.A. Darlison M.G. Barnard P.J. The molecular basis of muscular dystrophy in the mdx mouse: a point mutation.Science. 1989; 244: 1578-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Remarkably, previously injured tibialis anterior (TA) muscles from CR mice exhibited improved regenerative capacity, indicated by a higher density of newly formed myofibers in comparison to control mice at 7 days after injury (n = 7 [CR] or n = 6 [Ctl]; Figure 2A ). Moreover, transplant of satellite cells from CR-treated donors generated almost twice as many donor-derived (dystrophin-expressing) myofibers as an equal number of satellite cells from control mice (n = 4 [CR] or n = 3 [Ctl] recipient mice; Figure 2B), signifying a substantial enhancement of transplantation efficiency and in vivo regenerative potential of muscle stem cells harvested from donors subjected to short-term CR. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of CR were not limited to the stem cell donor. In a complementary experiment, we transplanted fluorescently labeled (GFP+) satellite cells from ad lib fed mice into CR-treated C57BL/6 mice, in which CR was initiated at 10 weeks of age, or into age-matched controls. CR was continued for an additional 4 weeks after transplant. Strikingly, despite receiving the same donor cells as control fed recipients, when sacrificed for analysis, CR recipients showed ∼4-fold greater engraftment of myofibers (n = 4 mice per group, Figure 2C), demonstrating increased contribution of transplanted cells to muscle regeneration under CR conditions. We hypothesize that the beneficial impact of CR in the host for satellite cell engraftment relates at least in part to the anti-inflammatory effects of CR. Consistent with previous studies showing reduced inflammation in CR-treated animals (reviewed in Fontana, 2009Fontana L. Neuroendocrine factors in the regulation of inflammation: excessive adiposity and calorie restriction.Exp. Gerontol. 2009; 44: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), CR mice in our experiments exhibited a significant reduction in the frequency of inflammatory cells in muscle as compared to controls (Figures 1E and S2D). Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that cell transplantation into the muscle of immunocompetent animals leads frequently to acute cell death. In the case of myoblast transplant, 95%–99% of transferred cells may die within days of transplant, and this death has been proposed to result from an innate immune/inflammatory response mounted by the host (Tremblay and Guerette, 1997Tremblay J.P. Guerette B. Myoblast transplantation: A brief review of the problems and of some solutions.Basic Appl. Myol. 1997; 7: 221-230Google Scholar). Thus, we predict that the increased engraftment seen in CR recipients may be explained by improved survival of the transplanted cells in CR muscle as opposed to control muscle due to a CR-induced decrease in the host inflammatory response. In summary, the data presented here demonstrate that reduced-calorie intake rapidly alters the physiology and function of muscle stem cells, such that even short-term CR, initiated late in life (18 months, Figure S2), has significant beneficial effects in enhancing myogenic activity. Preliminary experiments using even older mice (27 months at time of sacrifice) indicate that short-term CR induces similar increases in muscle stem cell frequency in these animals as well (data not shown). These beneficial effects are associated with a dramatic metabolic reprogramming that favors oxidative over glycolytic metabolism and is linked to alterations in pivotal regulators of mitochondrial mass and function, including the NAD-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1. Probably in conjunction with other critical nutrient sensors such as AMPK, a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis in response to energy deprivation (Cantó and Auwerx, 2009Cantó C. Auwerx J.

Importantly, the enhanced myogenic function of satellite cells in the CR environment significantly accelerates endogenous repair and improves the capacity of donor muscle stem cells to productively engraft transplant recipients. These results support the notion that both cell-autonomous and nonautonomous factors, particularly metabolic regulators, contribute to the detrimental effects of aging on muscle regenerative function and therefore represent candidate targets for therapeutic intervention.

https://openalex.org/W2008677609,"Gene duplication is an important source of phenotypic change and adaptive evolution. We leverage a haploid hydatidiform mole to identify highly identical sequences missing from the reference genome, confirming that the cortical development gene Slit-Robo Rho GTPase-activating protein 2 (SRGAP2) duplicated three times exclusively in humans. We show that the promoter and first nine exons of SRGAP2 duplicated from 1q32.1 (SRGAP2A) to 1q21.1 (SRGAP2B) ∼3.4 million years ago (mya). Two larger duplications later copied SRGAP2B to chromosome 1p12 (SRGAP2C) and to proximal 1q21.1 (SRGAP2D) ∼2.4 and ∼1 mya, respectively. Sequence and expression analyses show that SRGAP2C is the most likely duplicate to encode a functional protein and is among the most fixed human-specific duplicate genes. Our data suggest a mechanism where incomplete duplication created a novel gene function-antagonizing parental SRGAP2 function-immediately ""at birth"" 2-3 mya, which is a time corresponding to the transition from Australopithecus to Homo and the beginning of neocortex expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2041118365,"Although distinct human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines can display considerable epigenetic variation, it has been unclear whether such variability impacts their utility for disease modeling. Here, we show that although low-passage female hiPSCs retain the inactive X chromosome of the somatic cell they are derived from, over time in culture they undergo an ""erosion"" of X chromosome inactivation (XCI). This erosion of XCI is characterized by loss of XIST expression and foci of H3-K27-trimethylation, as well as transcriptional derepression of genes on the inactive X that cannot be reversed by either differentiation or further reprogramming. We specifically demonstrate that erosion of XCI has a significant impact on the use of female hiPSCs for modeling Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. However, our finding that most genes subject to XCI are derepressed by this erosion of XCI suggests that it should be a significant consideration when selecting hiPSC lines for modeling any disease."
https://openalex.org/W2060833045,"Fatty liver disease is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes, and hepatic lipid accumulation may contribute to insulin resistance. Histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3) controls the circadian rhythm of hepatic lipogenesis. Here we show that, despite severe hepatosteatosis, mice with liver-specific depletion of Hdac3 have higher insulin sensitivity without any changes in insulin signaling or body weight compared to wild-type mice. Hdac3 depletion reroutes metabolic precursors towards lipid synthesis and storage within lipid droplets and away from hepatic glucose production. Perilipin 2, which coats lipid droplets, is markedly induced upon Hdac3 depletion and contributes to the development of both steatosis and improved tolerance to glucose. These findings suggest that the sequestration of hepatic lipids in perilipin 2–coated droplets ameliorates insulin resistance and establish Hdac3 as a pivotal epigenomic modifier that integrates signals from the circadian clock in the regulation of hepatic intermediary metabolism."

PCa also exhibits great intratumor histological and immunophenotypic heterogeneities, with low-grade tumors often harboring poorly differentiated areas and high-grade tumors containing relatively differentiated foci. The cellular basis for the histological and cellular heterogeneity of PCa remains unclear. Androgen and androgen receptor (AR) signaling has been implicated in PCa. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) blocks androgen production or AR signaling and is the mainstay treatment for advanced and recurrent PCa, but such interventions only achieve short-term efficacy due to the emergence of castration-resistant disease (i.e., castration-resistant prostate cancer, CRPC). Although many mechanisms, mostly centered on AR, have been proposed for CRPC development (Shen and Abate-Shen, 2010Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) protein expression in PCa positively correlates with its overall degree of differentiation (e.g., Abrahamsson et al., 1988Abrahamsson P.A.

At the cellular level, PCa contains differentiated cancer cells expressing high levels of PSA (i.e., PSA+), as well as PCa cells that express little or no PSA (i.e., PSA−/lo). The PSA−/lo cells appear to be rare in early-stage tumors but become more abundant in high-grade and locally advanced tumors, and some cases of PCa may completely lack PSA expression. PCa patients with tumors containing >50% PSA+ PCa cells tend to have longer survival (Roudier et al., 2003Roudier M.P. True L.D. Higano C.S. Vesselle H. Ellis W. Lange P. Vessella R.L.

These clinical observations raise a fundamental question: could PSA−/lo PCa cells be intrinsically distinct from PSA+ cells and thus play differential roles in tumor maintenance and progression to CRPC? Herein, we address this clinically relevant question using a PSA promoter-driven lentiviral reporter system to separate bulk PCa cells into PSA−/lo and PSA+ subpopulations. We first performed a semiquantitative PSA immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis in cohorts of untreated Gleason 7 (GS7, n = 10), Gleason 9 or 10 (GS9/10, n = 10), and treatment-failed (n = 23) PCa (see Figure S1 and Table S1 available online). Most tumor glands in GS7 tumors stained strongly for PSA, but there existed poorly differentiated areas of PSA−/lo cells (Figure S1A). In contrast, in GS9/10 tumors, the main histological pattern was undifferentiated tumor mass in which most tumor cells were PSA−/lo, with PSA+ foci only occasionally present (Figure S1B). In 23 recurrent PCa cases (mainly CRPC), some tumors resembled untreated GS9/10 tumors, but most tumors completely lacked PSA+ PCa cells (Figures S1C–S1F). Quantification revealed significantly increased numbers of PSA−/lo PCa cells in untreated GS9/10 and treatment-failed PCa compared to untreated GS7 tumors (Figure 1A ). Consistent with the IHC results, analysis of multiple microarray data sets in Oncomine revealed that tumor PSA mRNA levels were significantly decreased in high-grade primary tumors and in recurrent and metastatic PCa (Figure S2; data not shown). Importantly, reduced tumor PSA mRNA levels correlated with lymph node positivity, tumor recurrence, metastasis, and shortened patient survival (Figure S2; data not shown; see also Figure 6A). Together, the PSA IHC and mRNA analysis indicates that advanced and recurrent PCa have lower PSA mRNA and more undifferentiated PSA−/lo cells. To separate PSA−/lo from PSA+ PCa cells, we employed the PSAP-GFP lentivector, in which the PSA promoter (PSAP) drives eGFP expression (Yu et al., 2001Yu D. Chen D. Chiu C. Razmazma B. Chow Y.H. Pang S. Prostate-specific targeting using PSA promoter-based lentiviral vectors.Cancer Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Figure S3A). The PSAP was originally isolated from a PCa patient with high-serum PSA and was highly specific and sensitive for PSA-positive prostate (cancer) cells. We also generated two modified PSAP-GFP vectors (Figure S3A). Using the PSAP-GFP vector, we infected LNCaP cells at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 25 (Figure 1B), at which virtually all cells were infected, as evidenced by PCR detection of the GFP sequence in genomic DNA of randomly picked clones (Figure 1C). We then used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to purify out the top 10% GFP-bright (GFP+) and bottom 2%–6% GFP-negative/GFP-dim (i.e., GFP−/lo) LNCaP cells. The purity of GFP−/lo and GFP+ cells was 98%–100% and ≥97%, respectively (e.g., Figure S3B). LNCaP cells routinely cultured in RPMI-7% fetal bovine serum (FBS) contained 2.7% ± 1.8% (0.3%–6.0%; n = 15) GFP−/lo cells. When LNCaP cells were infected with PSAP-GFP-Psv40-neo (Figure S3A) followed by G418 selection for several weeks, we observed 2.7% ± 1.7% (n = 7) GFP−/lo cells. The percentage of GFP−/lo LNCaP cells was very close to that of PSA−/lo cells in LNCaP cultures (2.2% ± 1.5%; n = 4). Real-time (qPCR; Figure 1D) and semiquantitative (Figure S3C) RT-PCR revealed lower PSA mRNA levels in GFP−/lo LNCaP cells compared to the corresponding GFP+ cells. Also, most purified GFP+ LNCaP cells stained strongly positive for PSA protein, whereas GFP−/lo cells were weak or negative for PSA (Figure 1E). GFP−/lo LNCaP cells also expressed lower levels of AR mRNA (Figure 1D; Figure S3C) and protein (Figures 1F and 1G) compared to GFP+ cells. These results indicate that the PSAP-GFP lentiviral system faithfully reports endogenous PSA expression. Hence, in many forgoing experiments we refer to GFP+ and GFP−/lo cells as PSA+ and PSA−/lo cells, respectively. AR staining revealed ∼82% and 18% GFP+ LNCaP cells showing strong and intermediate nuclear AR, respectively, and no GFP+ LNCaP cells were negative for AR (Figure 1F). In contrast, 46% of the PSA−/lo LNCaP cells were completely negative for AR, whereas 41% and 13% PSA−/lo LNCaP cells had weak and strong AR, respectively (Figure 1F). These results suggest that the majority of PSA+ PCa cells are high in AR, whereas PSA−/lo cells express a gradient of AR, from completely negative to strong nuclear staining. When PSAP-GFP-infected LNCaP cells were cultured in androgen-deprived conditions, i.e., using charcoal dextran-stripped serum (CDSS) or with bicalutamide (an antiandrogen), PSA+ cells dramatically decreased with a concomitant expansion of PSA−/lo cells (Figure S3D). Purified PSA−/lo LNCaP cells also displayed higher survival and holoclone-forming (Li et al., 2008Li H. Chen X. Calhoun-Davis T. Claypool K. Tang D.G. PC3 human prostate carcinoma cell holoclones contain self-renewing tumor-initiating cells.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1820-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) capacity in the absence of androgen (Figure S3E). These results suggest that PSA−/lo PCa cells are resistant to androgen deprivation. Whole-genome transcriptome profiling in purified PSA−/lo and PSA+ LNCaP cells revealed distinct gene expression patterns in the two isogenic subpopulations (Figure 1H). A total of 726 probes representing 561 unique genes was significantly overexpressed, whereas 557 probes representing 403 genes were underexpressed (fold change [FC] ≥ 1.4, p < 0.05) in PSA−/lo LNCaP cells (Figure S3F; Figure S3G shows qPCR of several genes). A combination of Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and literature-based curation put many of these differentially expressed genes into distinct functional categories (Figure 1H; Table S2). Strikingly, as many as 10% of the genes overexpressed in PSA−/lo LNCaP cells were involved in antistress responses, which included detoxification (metallothioneins, GSTT2, etc.), hypoxia-responsive (HIF1α, THBS1, PLAU, APLN), p53 signaling (e.g, ZBTB7A, PSME3), and DNA-damage sensing/repair (e.g., MSH6, XPA, REV1) genes (Figures 1H and 1I; Table S2). The PSA−/lo LNCaP cells also overexpressed Bcl-2 and underexpressed many proapoptotic genes (Table S2). Differential expression of antistress and proapoptotic genes suggests that the PSA−/lo cells would be more resistant to not only androgen deprivation but also other stresses. Indeed, when LNCaP cells infected with PSAP-GFP were treated with CDSS plus bicalutamide, etoposide, paclitaxel (taxol), or H2O2, PSA−/lo cells expanded with concomitant decreases in PSA+ cells (Figure 1J). FACS analysis indicated that these treatments preferentially induced apoptosis in PSA+ LNCaP cells (data not shown). The PSA−/lo LNCaP cells underexpressed dozens of cell-cycle and mitosis-related genes (Figure 1H; Figure S3H; Table S2), suggesting that PSA−/lo PCa cells may be more quiescent than PSA+ cells. Several lines of evidence supported this suggestion. First, cell-cycle analysis revealed a smaller percentage of PSA−/lo LNCaP cells in S and G2/M phases (Figure 1K). Second, the PSA−/lo and PSA+ LNCaP populations had 4.2% and 12%, respectively, of Ki-67+ cells (p < 0.0001). Third, BrdU label-retaining experiments demonstrated that many more PSA−/lo LNCaP cells retained the BrdU label upon an 11-d chase (Figure 1L). The observations that PSA−/lo LNCaP cells are quiescent and resist stress stimulations suggest that the population may be enriched in stem cells (SCs) (Laffin and Tang, 2010Laffin B. Tang D.G. An old player on a new playground: bmi-1 as a regulator of prostate stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 639-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In support of this, the PSA−/lo LNCaP cells, in androgen/serum-free medium, possessed higher capacity to establish holoclones (Figure S3E) and anchorage-independent prostaspheres (Figure 2A ). The PSA−/lo cell-derived spheres were much larger (Figure 2A, insets) and generated significantly more secondary spheres than the PSA+ cell-originated spheres (Figure 2B). PSA−/lo LNCaP cells also preferentially expressed many SC and developmental genes, such as ASCL1, CTED2, GATA6, IGF-1R, KLF5, LRIG1, NKX3.1, and TBX15 (Figure 1H; Figure 2C; Table S2). We employed tetracycline-inducible pTRIPZ lentiviral shRNAmir system to knock down three representative SC molecules, i.e., ASCL1 (Jiang et al., 2009Jiang T. Collins B.J. Jin N. Watkins D.N. Brock M.V. Matsui W. Nelkin B.D. Ball D.W. Achaete-scute complex homologue 1 regulates tumor-initiating capacity in human small cell lung cancer.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), NKX3.1 (Wang et al., 2009bWang X. Kruithof-de Julio M. Economides K.D. Walker D. Yu H. Halili M.V. Hu Y.P. Price S.M. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. A luminal epithelial stem cell that is a cell of origin for prostate cancer.Nature. 2009; 461: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), and IGF-1R (Chan et al., 1998Chan J.M. Stampfer M.J. Giovannucci E. Gann P.H. Ma J. Wilkinson P. Hennekens C.H. Pollak M. Plasma insulin-like growth factor-I and prostate cancer risk: a prospective study.Science. 1998; 279: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar) (Figure S3I) in PSA−/lo LNCaP cells. Knocking down each of these molecules reduced sphere formation of PSA−/lo LNCaP cells (Figure 2D) without affecting the inherently low sphere-forming activity in PSA+ LNCaP cells (data not shown). Furthermore, ASCL1 knockdown significantly inhibited (p < 0.05), whereas IGF-1R or NKX3.1 knockdown partially reduced, the expansion of PSA−/lo cells caused by androgen deprivation and etoposide (Figure 2E). These results suggest that at least some of the “stemness” genes overexpressed in the PSA−/lo LNCaP cells are functionally important. Interestingly, PSA−/lo LNCaP cells, compared to PSA+ cells, overexpressed some (e.g., EED, HDAC4, PHF8) but underexpressed other (e.g., DNMT3B, PHF19) chromatin modifiers/epigenetic regulators (Figure S3J; Table S2). The functional significance of these changes in regulating the epigenetic landscape of PSA−/lo PCa cells is currently explored by genome-wide ChIP-Seq analysis. LNCaP cultures in RPMI-7% FBS contained ∼1.4% of GFP−/lo cells, with the bulk being GFP+ (Figure S4A). When purified cells were cultured continuously for ∼3 weeks, GFP+ LNCaP cells remained all GFP+ (Figure S4B), whereas GFP− cultures became heterogeneous, containing 1.8% GFP− cells and ∼75% GFP-bright cells (Figure S4C). The 2° GFP+ LNCaP cultures derived from 1° GFP− cells continued to remain all GFP+ after an additional 17-day culture (Figure S4D), whereas the 2° GFP− cultures continued to regenerate both GFP− and GFP+ cells (data not shown). Clonal development assays (Patrawala et al., 2005Patrawala L. Calhoun T. Schneider-Broussard R. Zhou J. Claypool K. Tang D.G.

In contrast, single GFP−/lo LNCaP cells developed into three distinct types of clones: type I with all cells being GFP+, type II containing both GFP+ and GFP−/lo cells, and type III containing all GFP−/lo cells (Figures S4F–S4H). Quantitative analysis demonstrated that by 2 weeks, 70%–80% of all clones derived from single GFP−/lo LNCaP cells were type I and ∼20% were type II, whereas the rest were type III (Figures S4I and S4J). Type I clones were likely derived from the cells that, at the sorting, had already committed to differentiation. Type III clones might all be PSA−/lo cells that underwent symmetric self-renewal based on PCR exclusion of noninfection (Figure 1C). Regardless, the emergence of type II clones indicated that ∼20% PSA−/lo LNCaP cells were able to undergo asymmetric cell division (ACD), regenerating PSA−/lo and giving rise to PSA+ cells. Because ACD is the cardinal feature of SCs (Knoblich, 2008Knoblich J.A. Mechanisms of asymmetric stem cell division.Cell. 2008; 132: 583-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), we used time-lapse videomicroscopy to further study the clonal development of PSA+ versus PSA−/lo LNCaP cells. In agreement with our “static” clonal analysis (above), live imaging of single GFP+ cells showed that the PSA+ LNCaP cells only underwent symmetric division, generating clones that contained all PSA+ cells (Figure 2F; Movie S1). By contrast, single GFP− cells generated type I (Figure 2G; Movie S1), type II (Figure 2H; Movie S1), and type III (Figure 2I; Movie S1) clones. Approximately 15% of the GFP− LNCaP cells underwent ACD during the first cell division, with one daughter cell becoming GFP+ (Figure 2J). Analysis of the end-point clones derived from single GFP− cells showed that 21% and 11% clones were of type II and type III, respectively (Figure 2K). To further explore asymmetric PCa cell division, we examined Numb partition during or right after mitosis. Numb is a Notch antagonist preferentially segregated into the differentiated daughter cells during asymmetric divisions of neuronal, hematopoietic, and muscle SCs (Knoblich, 2008Knoblich J.A. Mechanisms of asymmetric stem cell division.Cell. 2008; 132: 583-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2007Wu M. Kwon H.Y. Rattis F. Blum J. Zhao C.

Imaging hematopoietic precursor division in real time.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 541-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We observed that in 242 GFP− LNCaP cells that had just undergone mitosis, 15% of the cells preferentially segregated Numb to the daughter cell that also expressed more PSA (Figure 2L; Figure 3A ). In such cells, Numb showed typical cortical concentration (Figure 3A), consistent with its well-established roles in cell polarity and ACD. Using “mitotic shake-off” strategy, we observed similar asymmetric cosegregation of PSA and Numb in one daughter cell in some GFP− LNCaP cells (Figure 3B, a–d), whereas in LNCaP cells that underwent symmetric division, Numb was also equally distributed in both cells (Figure 3B, e–h). Finally, we coinfected LNCaP cells with PSAP-GFP and a Numb-DsRed fusion retroviral reporter. The DsRed+/GFP− LNCaP underwent ACD at 6 hr, when Numb was partitioned in only one daughter cell, and from 24 hr, the Numb+ daughter cell also started to express GFP (i.e., PSA; Figure 3C). These observations indicate that a subset of PSA−/lo LNCaP cells can undergo authentic ACD associated with Numb cosegregation into the differentiated PSA+ daughter cells. We used PSAP-GFP or the modified lentivectors to establish LAPC9 (and LAPC4) “reporter” tumors (Figure S5A). The LAPC4 and LAPC9 xenograft models contain both differentiated and undifferentiated PCa cells and, as such, are very useful in elucidating the cellular heterogeneity of PCa (Patrawala et al., 2005Patrawala L.

Immunostaining using LAPC4 and LAPC9 cells purified from the reporter tumors revealed that most GFP+ cells stained strongly for PSA, whereas GFP−/lo tumor cells were generally negative or weak for PSA (Figures S5B and S5C). Western blotting (Figure 3D) and qPCR (data not shown) also revealed lower protein and mRNA levels of PSA and AR in GFP−/lo LAPC9 cells. In serum-containing medium, PSA−/lo LAPC9 cells initiated spheres that gradually enlarged and expanded and could be passaged for at least four generations, whereas PSA+ cell-initiated spheres aborted by 2° generation, despite that they formed slightly more 1° spheres (Figure 3E; Figure S5D), suggesting that PSA−/lo LAPC9 cells possess high sphere-propagating capacity. When PSA+ and PSA−/lo LAPC9 cells were cultured in medium containing CDSS, PSA−/lo cells formed much more (Figure 3F) and larger (Figure S5E) spheres than PSA+ cells. Interestingly, purified PSA−/lo LAPC4 cells founded more and larger spheres in both serum- (Figure S5F, a–c) and bicalutamide-containing (Figure S5F, d–f) media. Similar to PSA−/lo LNCaP cells, the PSA−/lo LAPC9 cells in the tumors were quiescent, as assessed by in vivo BrdU LRC (Figure 3G) and PKH26 dye-retaining (Pece et al., 2010Pece S. Tosoni D. Confalonieri S. Mazzarol G. Vecchi M. Ronzoni S. Bernard L. Viale G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P.

Finally, we infected LAPC9 cells with PSAP-GFP/Pcmv-DsRed (Figure S3A), plated the purified PSA−/lo (i.e., DsRed+/GFP−) cells on fibroblast feeder, and tracked their developmental fates. Although most PSA−/lo LAPC9 cells underwent symmetric cell division (Figure 3H, top), ∼5% cells underwent ACD, generating PSA+ LAPC9 cells (i.e., DsRed+/GFP+, yellow; Figure 3H, bottom). Microarray profiling revealed that ∼200 genes were overexpressed, whereas ∼300 genes were underexpressed (FC ≥ 1.4, p < 0.05) in PSA−/lo LAPC9 cells, which fall into distinct functional categories (Figure 3I; Table S3; Table S4). Most prominently, ∼27% of genes (>50) overexpressed in PSA−/lo LAPC9 cells were associated with SCs and development, which included SPP1 (osteopontin or OPN), FGFs, ALDH1A1, integrin α2, c-KIT, Bcl-2, IGF-1, CD44, and Nanog (Figure 3I, top; Table S3; Table S4). Overexpression of some of these molecules was confirmed by western blotting (Figure 3D) and/or qPCR (Figure S6B). Many of the upregulated genes including Bcl-2, IGF-1, IGFBP3, REG4, and Nanog have been implicated in resistance to androgen deprivation (Jeter et al., 2011Jeter C.R. Liu B. Liu X. Chen X. Liu C. Calhoun-Davis T. Repass J. Zaehres H. Shen J.J. Tang D.G. NANOG promotes cancer stem cell characteristics and prostate cancer resistance to androgen deprivation.Oncogene. 2011; 30: 3833-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the PSA−/lo LAPC9 cells overexpressed about 20 neural/glial-related genes (Table S4), suggesting that PSA−/lo cells might be related to or have the ability to generate neuroendocrine-like cells. Finally, many genes preferentially expressed in PSA−/lo LAPC9 cells were shared with those expressed in ESCs or with the genes having either bivalent or H3K27me3 chromatin marks (Figure S6C). The major class of genes upregulated in PSA+ LAPC9 cells (26%) was involved in intermediated metabolism and, interestingly, NumbL, the mammalian homolog of Numb, was overexpressed in PSA+ cells (Figure 3I, bottom; Table S3). Next, we performed limiting-dilution assays (LDAs) and serial tumor transplantation assays by monitoring tumor latency, incidence, growth rate, and/or endpoint weight. We first implanted 10,000 each of PSA−/lo (i.e., GFP−/lo) and PSA+ (GFP+) LAPC9 cells subcutaneously in hormonally intact male NOD/SCID mice. Surprisingly, PSA+ LAPC9 cells readily regenerated primary (1°) tumors that were about twice as large as those derived from PSA−/lo cells (Figure 4A ; Figure S7A). When we infected LAPC9 cells with PSAP-GFP/Pcmv-DsRed and purified out PSA+ (GFP+DsRed+) and PSA−/lo (GFP−DsRed+) cells for LDAs, the former demonstrated higher tumor-regenerating capacity (Table 1) and developed larger tumors (data not shown). Similarly, when PSA+ and PSA−/lo LAPC9 cells were implanted orthotopically in the dorsal prostate (DP), PSA+ cells initiated more (Table 1) and larger (data not shown) tumors. The PSA+ LNCaP cells implanted in testosterone-supplemented male NOD/SCID mice also initiated larger tumors (Table 1). These findings suggest that “differentiated” PSA+ PCa cells are, unexpectedly, tumorigenic in androgen-proficient hosts.Table 1Tumor-Initiating Frequency of PSA+ and PSA−/lo PCa Cells in NOD/SCID MiceCellsCell DoseTumor-Initiating Frequency (95% Interval)aTumor-initiating frequency and statistical differences (p values) were determined using the Limdil function of the Statmod package (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/index.html).p ValueaTumor-initiating frequency and statistical differences (p values) were determined using the Limdil function of the Statmod package (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/index.html).105104103102101LNCaPPSA+ (male)2/4 (1.0 g)PSA−/lo (male)3/5 (0.3 g)PSA+ (castr.)0/6PSA−/lo (castr.)2/6 (1.3 g)PSA+ (female)1/6 (0.5 g)1/6 (0.05 g)1/30,110 (1/7,199–125,944)PSA−/lo (female)4/5 (1.4 g)5/7 (0.7 g)1/2,674 (1/986–7,250)0.0005LAPC9PSA+ (male)bLAPC9 cells acutely purified from xenograft tumors were infected with PSAP-GFP/Pcmv-DsRed (moi 20; 72 hr).

https://openalex.org/W2064010630,"Hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome (HMPS) is characterized by apparent autosomal dominant inheritance of multiple types of colorectal polyp, with colorectal carcinoma occurring in a high proportion of affected individuals. Here, we use genetic mapping, copy-number analysis, exclusion of mutations by high-throughput sequencing, gene expression analysis and functional assays to show that HMPS is caused by a duplication spanning the 3' end of the SCG5 gene and a region upstream of the GREM1 locus. This unusual mutation is associated with increased allele-specific GREM1 expression. Whereas GREM1 is expressed in intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts in controls, GREM1 is predominantly expressed in the epithelium of the large bowel in individuals with HMPS. The HMPS duplication contains predicted enhancer elements; some of these interact with the GREM1 promoter and can drive gene expression in vitro. Increased GREM1 expression is predicted to cause reduced bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway activity, a mechanism that also underlies tumorigenesis in juvenile polyposis of the large bowel."
https://openalex.org/W2117975627,"Smoking is the only modifiable risk factor that is associated with the development, expansion and rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). However, the causative link between cigarette smoke and AAA is unknown. Here we report a causative link between smoking and AAA in vivo. Acute infusion of angiotensin II (AngII) or nicotine, a major component of cigarette smoke, markedly increased the incidence of AAA in apolipoprotein E (apoE) knockout (Apoe(-/-)) mice and in mice deficient in both apoE and the AMP-activated kinase α1 subunit (AMPK-α1) (Apoe(-/-); Prkaa1(-/-) mice). In contrast, genetic deletion of AMPK-α2 (Apoe(-/-); Prkaa2(-/-) mice) ablated nicotine- or AngII-triggered AAA in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that both nicotine and AngII activated AMPK-α2 in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), resulting in the phosphorylation of activator protein 2α (AP-2α) and consequent matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) gene expression. We conclude that smoking (through nicotine) instigates AAA through AMPK-α2–mediated AP-2α–dependent MMP2 expression in VSMCs."
https://openalex.org/W2126195570,"Transcriptional heterogeneity within embryonic stem cell (ESC) populations has been suggested as a mechanism by which a seemingly homogeneous cell population can initiate differentiation into an array of different cell types. Chromatin remodeling proteins have been shown to control transcriptional variability in yeast and to be important for mammalian ESC lineage commitment. Here we show that the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylation (NuRD) complex, which is required for ESC lineage commitment, modulates both transcriptional heterogeneity and the dynamic range of a set of pluripotency genes in ESCs. In self-renewing conditions, the influence of NuRD at these genes is balanced by the opposing action of self-renewal factors. Upon loss of self-renewal factors, the action of NuRD is sufficient to silence transcription of these pluripotency genes, allowing cells to exit self-renewal. We propose that modulation of transcription levels by NuRD is key to maintaining the differentiation responsiveness of pluripotent cells.

NuRD directly regulates the transcription of pluripotency genes The repressive activity of NuRD is required for ESC differentiation NuRD mediates transcriptional heterogeneity in ESC populations Transcription levels are determined by balanced activation and silencing Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have the ability to differentiate into any cell type in an adult animal, a trait known as pluripotency. They are also able to self-renew, or to proliferate indefinitely in culture without losing their developmental potential. There is considerable hope that human ESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) will provide both a model system for better understanding early human development and a source of human tissue to be used in drug screening and for studying disease progression (Yamanaka, 2009Yamanaka S. A fresh look at iPS cells.Cell. 2009; 137: 13-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). In order to realize the therapeutic potential of ESCs and iPSCs, it will be essential to be able to control both their exit from the self-renewal program and their subsequent commitments to particular developmental lineages. Entry into lineage-specific differentiation from the pluripotent state is pivotal to mammalian development, yet the molecular mechanisms behind control of lineage commitment remain poorly understood. ESCs grown in standard conditions (i.e., in growth medium supplemented with bovine serum and the cytokine Leukemia Inhibitory Factor, or LIF) contain subpopulations of differentiating cells, despite the fact that the majority of cells in the culture are undergoing self-renewal. Thus, functional heterogeneity exists in a culture of genetically identical cells being exposed to uniform culture conditions, indicating that stochastic events may be involved in exiting self-renewal. Recently it has emerged that ESCs grown in serum and LIF conditions express variable levels of a number of pluripotency-associated transcription factors, and that the expression levels of some of these genes correlate with the differentiation potential of a cell (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A.

Kalkan T. Smith A.G. The ground state of pluripotency.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2010; 38: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Thus transcriptional heterogeneity within cell populations is tightly linked to cellular heterogeneity, and the former could underlie the emergence of the latter. The differences between lineage-committed cells and the pluripotent cells from which they originated are largely defined by gene expression patterns. Evidence for this comes from the demonstration that pluripotency can be induced in somatic cells via introduction of only four transcription factors (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18864) Google Scholar). Further evidence is provided by studies showing that pluripotent embryonic germ cell lines can be efficiently derived from embryonic gonads, which consist entirely of lineage-committed cells (Leitch et al., 2010Leitch H.G. Blair K. Mansfield W. Ayetey H. Humphreys P. Nichols J. Surani M.A. Smith A.

It therefore stands to reason that proteins involved in the control of transcription will play important roles in lineage commitment and differentiation of pluripotent cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, several proteins involved in transcriptional regulation have been shown to be important for early embryonic viability and for ESC lineage commitment or pluripotency (reviewed in McDonel et al., 2009McDonel P.

How is pluripotency determined and maintained?.Development. 2007; 134: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylation (NuRD) corepressor complex is an example of a transcriptional modulator that has been shown to be required for developmental transitions of pluripotent cells in both peri-implantation stage embryos and ESCs (Kaji et al., 2006Kaji K.

In species such as flies and worms, NuRD components have been shown to play important roles in signaling pathways and in tissue patterning (Ahringer, 2000Ahringer J.

In mice, NuRD-mediated silencing has been implicated in cell fate decisions in somatic stem cells (Kashiwagi et al., 2007Kashiwagi M. Morgan B.A. Georgopoulos K.

Mbd3, a component of the NuRD co-repressor complex, is required for development of pluripotent cells.Development. 2007; 134: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The scaffold protein Mbd3 is essential for proper assembly of the NuRD complex (Kaji et al., 2006Kaji K. Caballero I.M. MacLeod R. Nichols J. Wilson V.A. Hendrich B.

Analysis of the NuRD subunits reveals a histone deacetylase core complex and a connection with DNA methylation.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Mbd3−/− ESCs are viable and maintain expression of genes associated with pluripotent cells, but continue to self-renew when induced to differentiate via removal of self-renewal factors (Kaji et al., 2006Kaji K. Caballero I.M. MacLeod R. Nichols J. Wilson V.A. Hendrich B. The NuRD component Mbd3 is required for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). NuRD has been shown to maintain the barrier between embryonic and trophoblast cell fates in ESCs (Latos et al., 2012Latos P.A.

Mbd3, a component of NuRD/Mi-2 complex, helps maintain pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells by repressing trophectoderm differentiation.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7684Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Importantly, while cells lacking NuRD activity do gain the ability to form trophoblast cells, in the absence of trophoblast-inducing external stimuli, they remain as self-renewing ESCs (Latos et al., 2012Latos P.A. Helliwell C. Mosaku O. Dudzinska D.A. Stubbs B. Berdasco M. Esteller M. Hendrich B.

In this study we address the question of how NuRD-mediated transcriptional regulation facilitates lineage commitment of ESCs. We find that NuRD directly regulates the expression levels of a number of pluripotency genes in ESCs. Rather than completely silencing these targets, however, we provide evidence that NuRD is required to attenuate transcript levels below a threshold that allows exit from pluripotency, thus sensitizing cells to a loss of self-renewal factors. We further show that it is the interplay between variable transcriptional activation signals and the repressive influence of the NuRD complex that results in transcriptional heterogeneity at pluripotency-associated genes in ESC cultures. Overexpression of a number of genes in ESCs has previously been shown to reduce or remove a dependency of ESCs upon LIF for self-renewal (Chambers et al., 2003Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M.

Chem. 2008; 283: 35825-35833Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Similarly, ESCs lacking the structural NuRD component protein Mbd3 are capable of LIF-independent self-renewal (Kaji et al., 2006Kaji K. Caballero I.M. MacLeod R. Nichols J. Wilson V.A. Hendrich B. The NuRD component Mbd3 is required for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that NuRD activity is required to restrict expression of pluripotency-associated genes. Although mRNA levels of the canonical pluripotency genes Pou5f1, Nanog, and Sox2 were not significantly increased in Mbd3−/− compared to those in wild-type ESCs, we found increases in the expression levels of Zfp42 (Rex1), Tbx3, Klf4, and Klf5 in Mbd3 mutant ESCs (Figure 1A ). In all cases expression of these genes was reduced to normal or lower levels when an Mbd3 transgene was introduced into the mutant cells (“rescued“ ESCs; Kaji et al., 2006Kaji K. Caballero I.M. MacLeod R. Nichols J. Wilson V.A. Hendrich B. The NuRD component Mbd3 is required for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the observed expression changes correlate with the presence or absence of NuRD function. To determine whether this control of active transcription is exerted directly or indirectly by the NuRD complex, we assessed NuRD component binding to the promoters of misexpressed genes in ESCs using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The presence of the NuRD components Mi2β and Mbd3 was detected at the promoters and gene bodies of pluripotency-associated genes in undifferentiated ESCs (Figures 1B and 1C; Figure S1 available online). While both Mi2β and Mbd3 binding was most apparent near transcription start sites, association of both proteins could be detected in a broad region encompassing the promoters and gene bodies of these targets, consistent with previous studies in both mouse and insect cells (Miccio et al., 2010Miccio A.

Mi2β association remained 24 hr after LIF withdrawal from standard media at all genes tested (Figure 1B), indicating that NuRD activity serves both to attenuate expression of these genes during self-renewal and to reinforce downregulation as cells lose positive regulators and commit to differentiate. NuRD is known as a transcriptional silencer; however, our expression data indicate that NuRD acts to restrict expression levels of a set of actively transcribed genes, rather than repress them completely. Zfp42, Tbx3, and Klf4 all show heterogeneous expression patterns in ESCs grown in serum and LIF conditions (Toyooka et al., 2008Toyooka Y. Shimosato D. Murakami K. Takahashi K. Niwa H. Identification and characterization of subpopulations in undifferentiated ES cell culture.Development. 2008; 135: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Changes in overall expression levels in Mbd3−/− ESCs could therefore be due either to the loss of silencing in the subpopulation of cells normally exhibiting low expression levels, or to the modulation of active transcription across the population as a whole. To distinguish between these possibilities we assessed the relative expression levels of these same genes in wild-type and mutant ESCs grown in 2i media supplemented with LIF (2i/LIF). ESCs maintained in 2i/LIF conditions do not spontaneously differentiate and display a uniformly high level of Nanog and Rex1 expression (Wray et al., 2010Wray J. Kalkan T. Smith A.G. The ground state of pluripotency.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2010; 38: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2A , all pluripotency markers tested showed an increase in transcript levels in Mbd3−/− ESCs relative to wild-type cells, with Tbx3, Klf4, and Klf5 again exhibiting the most pronounced effects. Mi2β association was also found at these genes by ChIP in ESCs grown in 2i/LIF conditions (Figure 2B). Since cells grown in 2i/LIF completely lack the low-expressing subpopulation, these data confirm that NuRD indeed functions to restrict active transcription of these pluripotency-associated genes in ESCs. It is possible that ESCs maintained in culture for long periods would undergo adaptive changes in response to the loss of NuRD activity. To verify that expression of pluripotency-associated genes is acutely responsive to the presence or absence of NuRD function, we took advantage of Mbd3−/− ESCs expressing an inducible Mbd3 protein (isoform b, Mbd3b) (Reynolds et al., 2012Reynolds N. Salmon-Divon M. Dvinge H. Hynes-Allen A. Balasooriya G. Leaford D. Behrens A. Bertone P. Hendrich B. NuRD-mediated deacetylation of H3K27 facilitates recruitment of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 to direct gene repression.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In these cells exogenous Mbd3b is fused at both its N and C termini to the mouse estrogen receptor (MER), resulting in the protein being sequestered in the cytoplasm. Upon addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, MER-Mbd3b-MER translocates into the nucleus, restoring NuRD function and NuRD-mediated gene silencing (Reynolds et al., 2012Reynolds N. Salmon-Divon M. Dvinge H. Hynes-Allen A. Balasooriya G. Leaford D. Behrens A. Bertone P. Hendrich B. NuRD-mediated deacetylation of H3K27 facilitates recruitment of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 to direct gene repression.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Using this system we observed recruitment of NuRD to the promoter regions, together with a reduction in expression levels, of Klf4, Klf5, Tbx3, and Zfp42 within 20 hr of 4-hydroxytamoxifen exposure (Figures 2C and 2D). We therefore conclude that NuRD-mediated control of pluripotency gene expression is not an artifact of long-term culture. If the misexpression of these pluripotency genes contributes toward the LIF-independent self-renewal phenotype displayed by Mbd3−/− ESCs, then overexpression should persist in conditions that would normally induce lineage commitment. Because expression of Zfp42, Tbx3, Klf4, and Klf5 has been shown to be stimulated by LIF signaling (Hall et al., 2009Hall J. Guo G. Wray J. Eyres I. Nichols J. Grotewold L. Morfopoulou S.

Shimosato D. Murakami K. Takahashi K. Niwa H. Identification and characterization of subpopulations in undifferentiated ES cell culture.Development. 2008; 135: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), we monitored expression levels of these genes in Mbd3−/− ESCs over a time course of LIF withdrawal. LIF withdrawal for 24 hr was sufficient to attenuate transcriptional activation mediated by Stat3, the downstream effector of the LIF signaling pathway (Niwa et al., 1998Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A. Self-renewal of pluripotent embryonic stem cells is mediated via activation of STAT3.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar), in both wild-type and Mbd3−/− cells. This was verified both by a decrease in expression of the Stat3 target gene Socs3 and by loss of Stat3 binding to the Socs3 promoter (Figure S2), demonstrating that Mbd3−/− ESCs remain sensitive to the presence or absence of LIF stimulation. Like wild-type ESCs, Mbd3−/− ESCs displayed an abrupt downregulation of Zfp42, Tbx3, Klf4, and Klf5 24 hr after LIF withdrawal (Figure 3A ), indicating that these genes remain sensitive to Stat3-mediated activation in the absence of functional NuRD complex. Nevertheless, expression of all four genes remained elevated in Mbd3−/− cells compared to wild-type cells, and little or no ongoing decrease was seen beyond the initial drop upon LIF withdrawal. However, while Zfp42, Tbx3, Klf4, and Klf5 remain sensitive to LIF-mediated transcriptional activation in Mbd3−/− ESCs, complete silencing of the genes upon loss of the transcriptional activation signal does not occur, demonstrating a requirement for functional NuRD in this process. To determine the biological relevance of this failure to completely silence pluripotency gene expression, we assessed the ability of Mbd3−/− ESCs to differentiate when the transcript levels of Klf4 or Klf5 were reduced to approximately wild-type levels (Figure 3B). Mbd3−/− ESCs and those expressing an RNAi construct directed against an irrelevant transcript (encoding LacZ) produced 40%–50% undifferentiated colonies when plated at clonal density in the absence of LIF for 4 days, whereas under the same conditions, wild-type cells produced almost exclusively differentiated colonies (Figure 3C). Knocking down Klf4 expression in Mbd3−/− cells, however, resulted in a marked rescue of the differentiation defect, in that nearly all colonies contained differentiated cells (Figure 3C). In contrast, knocking down Klf5 in Mbd3−/− ESCs had no rescuing effect in this assay. Notably, knockdown of Klf4 in Mbd3−/− ESCs also resulted in reduction of Klf5 transcript levels, whereas knockdown of Klf5 had no effect on Klf4 transcript levels (Figure 3B). In addition to displaying persistent self-renewal upon removal of LIF in culture, Mbd3−/− ESCs fail to contribute toward embryonic development in chimeric embryos (Kaji et al., 2006Kaji K. Caballero I.M. MacLeod R. Nichols J. Wilson V.A. Hendrich B. The NuRD component Mbd3 is required for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). When aggregated with a wild-type morula, Mbd3−/− ESCs fail to mix with host cells, prevent host cells from forming an embryo, and on their own form only a very rudimentary primitive ectoderm-like structure (Figure 3D). However, Mbd3−/− cells in which either Klf4 or Klf5 transcript levels were reduced via RNAi showed an increased ability to integrate into host embryos as compared to controls (Figures 3D and 3E). This reduction in phenotype severity by Klf4 or Klf5 knockdown was reversed by overexpression of an RNAi-resistant cDNA in both the Klf4 and Klf5 knockdown cell lines (Figure 3E). This demonstrates that inappropriate expression levels of both Klf4 and Klf5 contribute to the differentiation defect apparent in Mbd3−/− ESCs. The resulting chimeric embryos are, nevertheless, severely abnormal, indicating that while knocking down these Klf genes results in partial rescue, aberrant transcription of other genes is also likely to play a part in the Mbd3 mutant phenotype. We conclude that NuRD-mediated control of Klf4 and Klf5 expression, in addition to that of other genes, facilitates lineage commitment of ESCs. ESCs grown in standard serum and LIF conditions normally display heterogeneous expression of several of the genes we have shown to be subjected to NuRD-mediated transcriptional control. While cells grown in 2i/LIF conditions show no such heterogeneity in expression, they are nevertheless subject to NuRD-mediated restriction of transcription levels. It is therefore possible that the influence of NuRD differs between subpopulations of ESCs, and that this variation would be undetectable across the population as a whole. To understand how these processes are affected at the single-cell level, we used immunofluorescence to measure protein abundance in individual cells from wild-type and Mbd3 mutant ESC cultures (Figures S3A and S3B). Using this method, we can class wild-type cells grown in serum and LIF into high- or low-expressing populations based upon Klf4 staining intensity (Figure 4A , left-hand panels). Quantification of Klf5 staining levels similarly reveals two populations of cells in wild-type cultures, although the high- and low-expressing populations are less distinct than for Klf4 (Figure 4A). In contrast, ESCs assessed in the same way based on Oct4 staining appear as a single, relatively uniform population (Figure 4A), as do cells stained for NuRD component proteins or the unrelated nuclear protein Sin3a (Figure S3C). In the absence of a functional NuRD complex, two major changes to the Klf4 expression level distribution are apparent: first, the subpopulation of Klf4-negative cells is absent (Figure 4A). Second, there is an increase in the degree of Klf4 expression, i.e., the mean fluorescence intensity produced by Klf4-expressing cells is increased compared to that produced in wild-type cultures (p < 1e−4). NuRD activity is therefore important not only for generating the Klf4-low population, but also for restricting maximum expression levels in the Klf4-high population. This same pattern can be seen for the Klf5 protein (Figure 4A), whereas there is negligible change in the distribution of Oct4 expression in Mbd3−/− ESCs. Although Tbx3 has been reported to exhibit variable expression (Niwa et al., 2009Niwa H. Ogawa K. Shimosato D. Adachi K. A parallel circuit of LIF signalling pathways maintains pluripotency of mouse ES cells.Nature. 2009; 460: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), Tbx3 protein was not detectable by immunofluorescence in wild-type cells, but instead appears as a broad peak in Mbd3−/− ESCs (Figure 4A).

Using several different techniques to manipulate lateral pulvinar activity, the authors report that the lateral pulvinar is able to gate information outflow from V1. The primary visual cortex (V1) receives its driving input from the eyes via the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus. The lateral pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus also projects to V1, but this input is not well understood. We manipulated lateral pulvinar neural activity in prosimian primates and assessed the effect on supra-granular layers of V1 that project to higher visual cortex. Reversibly inactivating lateral pulvinar prevented supra-granular V1 neurons from responding to visual stimulation. Reversible, focal excitation of lateral pulvinar receptive fields increased the visual responses in coincident V1 receptive fields fourfold and shifted partially overlapping V1 receptive fields toward the center of excitation. V1 responses to regions surrounding the excited lateral pulvinar receptive fields were suppressed. LGN responses were unaffected by these lateral pulvinar manipulations. Excitation of lateral pulvinar after LGN lesion activated supra-granular layer V1 neurons. Thus, lateral pulvinar is able to powerfully control and gate information outflow from V1."
https://openalex.org/W1997032129,"Promoting brown adipose tissue (BAT) formation and function may reduce obesity. Recent data link retinoids to energy balance, but a specific role for retinoid metabolism in white versus brown fat is unknown. Retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (Aldhs), also known as aldehyde dehydrogenases, are rate-limiting enzymes that convert retinaldehyde (Rald) to retinoic acid. Here we show that Aldh1a1 is expressed predominately in white adipose tissue (WAT), including visceral depots in mice and humans. Deficiency of the Aldh1a1 gene induced a BAT-like transcriptional program in WAT that drove uncoupled respiration and adaptive thermogenesis. WAT-selective Aldh1a1 knockdown conferred this BAT program in obese mice, limiting weight gain and improving glucose homeostasis. Rald induced uncoupling protein-1 (Ucp1) mRNA and protein levels in white adipocytes by selectively activating the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), recruiting the coactivator PGC-1α and inducing Ucp1 promoter activity. These data establish Aldh1a1 and its substrate Rald as previously unrecognized determinants of adipocyte plasticity and adaptive thermogenesis, which may have potential therapeutic implications."

Here, we identified that Snail interacted with Suv39H1 (suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1), a major methyltransferase responsible for H3K9me3 that intimately links to DNA methylation. We demonstrated that the SNAG domain of Snail and the SET domain of Suv39H1 were required for their mutual interactions. We found that H3K9me3 and DNA methylation on the E-cadherin promoter were higher in BLBC cell lines. We showed that Snail interacted with Suv39H1 and recruited it to the E-cadherin promoter for transcriptional repression. Knockdown of Suv39H1 restored E-cadherin expression by blocking H3K9me3 and DNA methylation and resulted in the inhibition of cell migration, invasion and metastasis of BLBC. Our study not only reveals a critical mechanism underlying the epigenetic regulation of EMT, but also paves a way for the development of new treatment strategies against this disease."

https://openalex.org/W2116023353,"Almost all terrestrial plants produce green leaf volatiles (GLVs), consisting of six-carbon (C6) aldehydes, alcohols and their esters, after mechanical wounding. C6 aldehydes deter enemies, but C6 alcohols and esters are rather inert. In this study, we address why the ability to produce various GLVs in wounded plant tissues has been conserved in the plant kingdom. The major product in completely disrupted Arabidopsis leaf tissues was (Z)-3-hexenal, while (Z)-3-hexenol and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate were the main products formed in the intact parts of partially wounded leaves. 13C-labeled C6 aldehydes placed on the disrupted part of a wounded leaf diffused into neighboring intact tissues and were reduced to C6 alcohols. The reduction of the aldehydes to alcohols was catalyzed by an NADPH-dependent reductase. When NADPH was supplemented to disrupted tissues, C6 aldehydes were reduced to C6 alcohols, indicating that C6 aldehydes accumulated because of insufficient NADPH. When the leaves were exposed to higher doses of C6 aldehydes, however, a substantial fraction of C6 aldehydes persisted in the leaves and damaged them, indicating potential toxicity of C6 aldehydes to the leaf cells. Thus, the production of C6 aldehydes and their differential metabolisms in wounded leaves has dual benefits. In disrupted tissues, C6 aldehydes and their α,β-unsaturated aldehyde derivatives accumulate to deter invaders. In intact cells, the aldehydes are reduced to minimize self-toxicity and allow healthy cells to survive. The metabolism of GLVs is thus efficiently designed to meet ecophysiological requirements of the microenvironments within a wounded leaf."
https://openalex.org/W2043371470,"The subventricular zone (SVZ) neural stem cell niche contains mixed populations of stem cells, transit-amplifying cells, and migrating neuroblasts. Deciphering how endogenous signals, such as hormones, affect the balance between these cell types is essential for understanding the physiology of niche plasticity and homeostasis. We show that Thyroid Hormone (T3) and its receptor, TRα1, are directly involved in maintaining this balance. TRα1 is expressed in amplifying and migrating cells. In vivo gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate first, that T3/TRα1 directly repress Sox2 expression, and second, that TRα1 overexpression in the niche favors the appearance of DCX+ migrating neuroblasts. Lack of TRα increases numbers of SOX2+ cells in the SVZ. Hypothyroidism increases proportions of cells in interphase. Thus, in the adult SVZ, T3/TRα1 together favor neural stem cell commitment and progression toward a migrating neuroblast phenotype; this transition correlates with T3/TRα1-dependent transcriptional repression of Sox2."

Kinetochore–spindle binding and chromosome segregation are mediated by the multi-copy KNL1Spc105, MIS12Mtw1 and NDC80Ndc80 complexes that form the so-called KMN network. KMN–spindle attachment is regulated by the Aurora BIpl1 and MPS1Mps1 kinases. It is unclear whether other mechanisms exist that support KMN activity during the cell cycle. Using budding yeast, we show that kinetochore protein Cnn1 localizes to the base of the Ndc80 complex and promotes a functionally competent configuration of the KMN network. Cnn1 regulates KMN activity in a spatiotemporal manner by inhibiting the interaction between its complexes. Cnn1 activity peaks in anaphase and is driven by the Cdc28, Mps1 and Ipl1 kinases. The kinetochore is a multiprotein complex that tethers chromosomes to the mitotic spindle for accurate chromosome segregation. De Wulf and colleagues now show in budding yeast that the protein Cnn1 functions at the kinetochore and is recruited to the inner kinetochore, in a manner dependent on its phosphorylation mediated by the Cdc28, Mps1 and Ipl1 kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2008667373,"Single-minded 1 (Sim1) is a transcription factor necessary for development of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). This nucleus is a critical regulator of appetite, energy expenditure and body weight. Previously we showed that Sim1(+/-) mice and conditional postnatal Sim1(-/-) mice exhibit hyperphagia, obesity, increased linear growth and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity, but no decrease in energy expenditure. Bilateral ablation of the PVH causes obesity due to hyperphagia and reduced energy expenditure. It remains unknown whether Sim1 neurons regulate energy expenditure. In this study, Sim1cre mice were bred to homozygous inducible diphtheria toxin receptor (iDTR) mice to generate mice expressing the simian DTR in Sim1 cells. In these mice, Sim1 neuron ablation was performed by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of diphtheria toxin. Compared to controls, mice with Sim1 neuron ablation became obese (with increased fat mass) on a chow diet due to increased food intake and reduced energy expenditure. In post-injection mice, we observed a strong inverse correlation between the degree of obesity and hypothalamic Sim1 expression. The reduction in baseline energy expenditure observed in these mice was accompanied by a reduction in activity. This reduction in activity did not fully account for the reduced energy expenditure as these mice exhibited decreased resting energy expenditure, decreased body temperature, decreased brown adipose tissue temperature, and decreased UCP1 expression suggesting an impairment of thermogenesis. In injected mice, hypothalamic gene expression of Sim1, oxytocin (OXT) and thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) was reduced by about 50%. These results demonstrate that Sim1 neurons in adult mice regulate both food intake and energy expenditure. Based on the body of work in the field, feeding regulation by Sim1 neurons likely occurs in both the PVH and medial amygdala, in contrast to energy expenditure regulation by Sim1 neurons, which likely is localized to the PVH."

https://openalex.org/W2156653705,"The authors show that Preso1 acts as a scaffolding protein that binds mGluR, Homer and proline-directed kinases. Deletion of Preso1 prevents phosphorylation of mGluR at the Homer binding site and leads to an increase in mGluR5-dependent inflammatory pain. Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including mGluR1 and mGluR5, are G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are expressed at excitatory synapses in brain and spinal cord. GPCRs are often negatively regulated by specific G protein–coupled receptor kinases and subsequent binding of arrestin-like molecules. Here we demonstrate an alternative mechanism in which group I mGluRs are negatively regulated by proline-directed kinases that phosphorylate the binding site for the adaptor protein Homer, and thereby enhance mGluR–Homer binding to reduce signaling. This mechanism is dependent on a multidomain scaffolding protein, Preso1, that binds mGluR, Homer and proline-directed kinases and that is required for their phosphorylation of mGluR at the Homer binding site. Genetic ablation of Preso1 prevents dynamic phosphorylation of mGluR5, and Preso1−/− mice exhibit sustained, mGluR5-dependent inflammatory pain that is linked to enhanced mGluR signaling. Preso1 creates a microdomain for proline-directed kinases with broad substrate specificity to phosphorylate mGluR and to mediate negative regulation."

We radio-collared five females and five males in the Seima Protection Forest, Cambodia, in February to May, 2008 and January to March, 2009 and recorded their behaviour at 5 minutes intervals, totalling 2736 observations. We classified each observation as either inactive (sleeping or alert) or active behaviour (travel, feeding, grooming, or others). Moon luminosity (bright/dark) and ambient temperature were recorded for each observation. The response variable, activity, was binary (active or inactive), and a logit link function was used. Ambient temperature alone did not significantly affect mean activity. Although mean activity was significantly affected by moonlight, the interaction between moonlight and temperature was also significant: on bright nights, studied animals were increasingly more active with higher temperature; and on dark nights they were consistently active regardless of temperature. The most plausible explanation is that on bright cold nights the combined risk of being seen and attacked by predators and heat loss outweigh the benefit of active behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2092768535,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is closely linked to conversion of early-stage tumours into invasive malignancies. Many signalling pathways are involved in EMT, but the key regulatory kinases in this important process have not been clearly identified. Protein kinase CK2 is a multi-subunit protein kinase, which, when overexpressed, has been linked to disease progression and poor prognosis in various cancers. Specifically, overexpression of CK2α in human breast cancers is correlated with metastatic risk. In this article, we show that an imbalance of CK2 subunits reflected by a decrease in the CK2β regulatory subunit in a subset of breast tumour samples is correlated with induction of EMT-related markers. CK2β-depleted epithelial cells displayed EMT-like morphological changes, enhanced migration, and anchorage-independent growth, all of which require Snail1 induction. In epithelial cells, Snail1 stability is negatively regulated by CK2 and GSK3β through synergistic hierarchal phosphorylation. This process depends strongly on CK2β, thus confirming that CK2 functions upstream of Snail1. In primary breast tumours, CK2β underexpression also correlates strongly with expression of EMT markers, emphasizing the link between asymmetric expression of CK2 subunits and EMT in vivo. Our results therefore highlight the importance of CK2β in controlling epithelial cell plasticity. They show that CK2 holoenzyme activity is essential to suppress EMT, and that it contributes to maintaining a normal epithelial morphology. This study also suggests that unbalanced expression of CK2 subunits may drive EMT, thereby contributing to tumour progression."
https://openalex.org/W1991732983,"Exposure to rival males increases mating duration in Drosophila melanogaster. The authors show that visual stimuli are sufficient to induce longer mating duration (LMD). LMD requires the circadian clock genes timeless and period, and involves visual memory circuits and a subset of pigment dispersing factor–expressing neurons in the circadian circuit. Rival exposure causes Drosophila melanogaster males to prolong mating. Longer mating duration (LMD) may enhance reproductive success, but its underlying mechanism is currently unknown. We found that LMD is context dependent and can be induced solely via visual stimuli. In addition, we found that LMD involves neural circuits that are important for visual memory, including central neurons in the ellipsoid body, but not the mushroom bodies or the fan-shaped bodies, and may rely on the rival exposure memory lasting for several hours. LMD is affected by a subset of learning and memory mutants. LMD depends on the circadian clock genes timeless and period, but not Clock or cycle, and persists in many arrhythmic conditions. Moreover, LMD critically depends on a subset of pigment dispersing factor neurons rather than the entire circadian neural circuit. Our study thus delineates parts of the molecular and cellular basis for LMD, a plastic social behavior elicited by visual cues."
https://openalex.org/W2008289938,"The ability to direct differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells into specific lineages not only provides new insights into the pathways that regulate lineage selection but also has translational applications, for example in drug discovery. We set out to develop a method of differentiating ES cells into mesodermal cells at high efficiency without first having to induce embryoid body formation. ES cells were plated on a feeder layer of PA6 cells, which have membrane-associated stromal-derived inducing activity (SDIA), the molecular basis of which is currently unknown. Stimulation of ES/PA6 co-cultures with Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) both favoured self-renewal of ES cells and induced differentiation into a Desmin and Nestin double positive cell population. Combined stimulation with BMP4 and all-trans Retinoic Acid (RA) inhibited self-renewal and resulted in 90% of cells expressing Desmin and Nestin. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis confirmed that the cells were of mesodermal origin and expressed markers of mesenchymal and smooth muscle cells. BMP4 activation of a MAD-homolog (Smad)-dependent reporter in undifferentiated ES cells was attenuated by co-stimulation with RA and co-culture with PA6 cells. The Notch ligand Jag1 was expressed in PA6 cells and inhibition of Notch signalling blocked the differentiation inducing activity of PA6 cells. Our data suggest that mesodermal differentiation is regulated by the level of Smad activity as a result of inputs from BMP4, RA and the Notch pathway."

These phenotypes were transmitted maternally, indicating the etiological role of the mitochondria. Importantly, reduced SUV3 expression was observed in human breast tumor specimens compared with corresponding normal tissues in two independent cohorts.

Tube formation and capillary sprouting experiments reveal that depletion of HOP expression significantly inhibits vessel formation from endothelial cells. Wound healing and transwell migration assays show that HOP is important for endothelial cell migration. By examination of centrosome reorientation and membrane ruffle dynamics, we find that HOP plays a crucial role in the establishment of cell polarity in response to migratory stimulus. Furthermore, our data show that HOP interacts with tubulin and colocalizes with microtubules in endothelial cells. These findings indicate HOP as a novel regulator of angiogenesis that functions through promoting vascular endothelial cell polarization and migration."

In this study we examined the relation of birth weight (>2500 g) and gestational age (37–41 weeks) within the normal range with specific executive functions in 195 Singaporean six-year-old boys of Chinese ethnicity. Birth weight adjusted for gestational age was used as indicator of fetal growth while gestational age was indicative of fetal maturity. Linear regression revealed that increased fetal growth within the normal range is associated with an improved ability to learn rules during the intra/extra-dimensional shift task and to retain visual information for short period of time during the delayed matching to sample task. Moreover, faster and consistent reaction times during the stop-signal task were observed among boys born at term, but with higher gestational age. Hence, even among boys born at term with normal birth weight, variations in fetal growth and maturity showed distinct effects on specific executive functions."
https://openalex.org/W1967903474,"SynCAM1 is an adhesion molecule involved in synaptic differentiation and organization. SynCAM1 is also expressed in astroglial cells where it mediates astrocyte-to astrocyte and glial-neuronal adhesive communication. In astrocytes, SynCAM1 is functionally linked to erbB4 receptors, which are involved in the control of both neuronal/glial development and mature neuronal and glial function. Here we report that mice carrying a dominant-negative form of SynCAM1 specifically targeted to astrocytes (termed GFAP-DNSynCAM1 mice) exhibit disrupted diurnal locomotor activity with enhanced and more frequent episodes of activity than control littermates during the day (when the animals are normally sleeping) accompanied by shorter periods of rest. GFAP-DNSynCAM1 mice also display high levels of basal activity in the dark period (the rodent's awake/active time) that are attenuated by the psychostimulant D,L-amphetamine, and reduced anxiety levels in response to both avoidable and unavoidable provoking stimuli. These results indicate that disruption of SynCAM1-dependent astroglial function results in behavioral abnormalities similar to those described in animals model of attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), and suggest a hitherto unappreciated contribution of glial cells to the pathophysiology of this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2066099905,"Formation of all metazoan bodies is controlled by a group of selector genes including homeobox genes, highly conserved across the entire animal kingdom. The homeobox genes from Pou and Six classes are key members of the regulation cascades determining development of sensory organs, nervous system, gonads and muscles. Besides using common bilaterian models, more attention has recently been targeted at the identification and characterization of these genes within the basal metazoan phyla. Cnidaria as a diploblastic sister group to bilateria with simple and yet specialized organs are suitable models for studies on the sensory organ origin and the associated role of homeobox genes. In this work, Pou and Six homeobox genes, together with a broad range of other sensory-specific transcription factors, were identified in the transcriptome of hydrozoan jellyfish Craspedacusta sowerbyi. Phylogenetic analyses of Pou and Six proteins revealed cnidarian-specific sequence motifs and contributed to the classification of individual factors. The majority of the Craspedacusta sowerbyi Pou and Six homeobox genes are predominantly expressed in statocysts, manubrium and nerve ring, the tissues with sensory and nervous activities. The described diversity and expression patterns of Pou and Six factors in hydrozoan jellyfish highlight their evolutionarily conserved functions. This study extends the knowledge of the cnidarian genome complexity and shows that the transcriptome of hydrozoan jellyfish is generally rich in homeodomain transcription factors employed in the regulation of sensory and nervous functions."
https://openalex.org/W2082180360,"The Rab7 GTPase regulates late endosome trafficking of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) to the lysosome for degradation. However, less is known about how Rab7 activity, functioning late in the endocytic pathway, affects EGFR signaling. Here we used Caenorhabditis elegans vulva cell fate induction, a paradigm for genetic analysis of EGFR/Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) signaling, to assess the genetic requirements for rab-7. Using a rab-7 deletion mutant, we demonstrate that rab-7 antagonizes LET-23 EGFR signaling to a similar extent, but in a distinct manner, as previously described negative regulators such as sli-1 c-Cbl. Epistasis analysis places rab-7 upstream of or in parallel to lin-3 EGF and let-23 EGFR. However, expression of gfp::rab-7 in the Vulva Presursor Cells (VPCs) is sufficient to rescue the rab-7(-) VPC induction phenotypes indicating that RAB-7 functions in the signal receiving cell. We show that components of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT)-0, and -I, complexes, hgrs-1 Hrs, and vps-28, also antagonize signaling, suggesting that LET-23 EGFR likely transits through Multivesicular Bodies (MVBs) en route to the lysosome. Consistent with RAB-7 regulating LET-23 EGFR trafficking, rab-7 mutants have increased number of LET-23::GFP-positive endosomes. Our data imply that Rab7, by mediating EGFR trafficking and degradation, plays an important role in downregulation of EGFR signaling. Failure to downregulate EGFR signaling contributes to oncogenesis, and thus Rab7 could possess tumor suppressor activity in humans."

https://openalex.org/W2042971150,"Culturing many obligate intracellular bacteria is difficult or impossible. However, these organisms have numerous adaptations allowing for infection persistence and immune system evasion, making them some of the most interesting to study. Recent advancements in genome sequencing, pyrosequencing and Phi29 amplification, have allowed for examination of whole-genome sequences of intracellular bacteria without culture. We have applied both techniques to the model obligate intracellular pathogen Anaplasma marginale and the human pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum, in order to examine the ability of phi29 amplification to determine the sequence of genes allowing for immune system evasion and long-term persistence in the host. When compared to traditional pyrosequencing, phi29-mediated genome amplification had similar genome coverage, with no additional gaps in coverage. Additionally, all msp2 functional pseudogenes from two strains of A. marginale were detected and extracted from the phi29-amplified genomes, highlighting its utility in determining the full complement of genes involved in immune evasion."
