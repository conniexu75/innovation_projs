https://openalex.org/W2060190614,"We have investigated RNA recombination among poliovirus genomes by analyzing both intratypic and intertypic recombinant crosses involving the same defined genetic markers. Sequence analysis of the recombinant junctions of 13 nonsibling intertypic recombinants showed that intertypic RNA recombination is not site-specific, nor does it require extensive homology between the recombining parents at the crossover site. To discriminate between breaking-rejoining and copy choice mechanisms of RNA recombination, we have inhibited the replication of the recombining parents independently and found opposite effects on the frequency of genetic recombination in intratypic crosses. The results strongly support a copy choice mechanism for RNA recombination, in which the viral RNA polymerase switches templates during negative strand synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1971809076,"The primary structure of normal abl protein was determined by sequencing the coding region of its cDNA. abl contains two alternative 5′ exons spliced to a common set of 3′ exons to yield the two major abl RNA transcripts. These transcripts initiate in different promoter regions and give rise to proteins that vary in their N-termini. In the human cell line K562, abl is translocated from chromosome 9 to within the bcr gene on chromosome 22. Within the fused bcr-abl gene, abl exon II alternatively splices to two adjacent bcr exons. This phenomenon is seen in many patients with chronic myeloid leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W1492501257,"The structural genes for the arsenical pump of the conjugative R-factor R773 contained on a HindIII fragment of 4.3 kilobase pairs were cloned into bacteriophage M13. A series of ordered deletions was created using Bal31 digestion, and the nucleotide sequence of the operon determined. Three open reading frames for genes arsA, arsB, and arsC were found. The arsA gene encodes a hydrophilic protein of 63,169 Da with two potential adenylate-binding sites. The arsB gene encodes a potentially membrane protein of 45,577 Da. The arsC gene encodes a 15,811-Da hydrophilic protein. The arsA and arsC gene products correspond to cytosolic proteins previously identified from minicell experiments. Isolated ArsA protein was shown to bind to dye-agarose columns which act as affinity resins for nucleotide-binding proteins. A model is proposed in which these gene products form an anion translocating ATPase for extrusion of arsenite and arsenate from resistant cells."
https://openalex.org/W1984967872,The pallida gene of A. majus encodes a product required for the synthesis of red flower pigment. We have shown that the unstable pallida(recurrens) mutation is due to the insertion of the Tam3 transposable element near the promoter of the gene. Imprecise excision of Tam3 alters pallida gene expression and generates new spatial patterns or different intensities of flower pigmentation. Distinct spatial patterns may also result from rearrangements induced by Tam3 that alter the relative position of the pallida gene. Changes in Tam3 structure or position result in new unstable phenotypes. These findings suggest that genes may be rendered genetically hypervariable as a consequence of transposable element insertion and excision.
https://openalex.org/W1982904740,"Tumor formation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens involves the transfer and integration of a defined segment (T-DNA) of tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid DNA into the plant nuclear genome. A set of plasmid genes outside the T-DNA, the vir genes, are thought to mediate the transfer process. We report here that the virD operon encodes a site-specific endonuclease that cleaves at a unique site within each of the 24 bp direct repeats that flank the T-DNA. The endonuclease function was further localized to the 5' end of this operon by demonstrating that cleavage does not occur in virD mutant strains of Agrobacterium and that the 5' end of the virD operon is sufficient to direct cleavage in E. coli. Analysis of nucleotide sequence and protein data indicate that two proteins of 16.2 and 47.4 kd are involved."
https://openalex.org/W1597265569,"A cloned cDNA sequence for the unique mitochondrial uncoupling protein of rat brown adipose tissue has been used to assay the corresponding mRNA in several situations. When thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue is stimulated (exposure of adult rats to the cold, birth) a rapid and prolonged increase in the level of uncoupling protein mRNA is observed. Such an increase can be mimicked by injection of animals with a new beta-adrenoreceptor agonist BRL 26830A. Conversely it is known that mice and rats with genetic or surgical obesity have a weakly thermogenic brown adipose tissue with a reduced norepinephrine turnover. A reduced level of uncoupling protein mRNA was measured in obese fa/fa rats 10 days or 10 weeks old and in obese rats with a lesion of the ventromedial hypothalamic area but not in obese ob/ob mice. Moreover, exposure of obese animals to cold or dosing with BRL 26830A strikingly increased the level of uncoupling protein mRNA. Measurement of the relative concentration of nascent Ucp transcripts in nuclei isolated from brown adipose tissue indicates that Ucp gene is acutely (within 15 min) regulated at the level of transcription and is controlled via activation of beta-adrenoreceptors of plasma membrane. Ucp gene transcription is decreased in obese fa/fa rats but can be fully and rapidly turned on after injection of BRL 26830A."
https://openalex.org/W2015238489,"Promoters of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes are partly responsible for 3' end formation of snRNA precursors. In injected X. laevis oocytes, substitution of an mRNA promoter (HSV tk) for the snRNA promoter significantly reduces the utilization of a conserved snRNA 3' end signal and permits recognition of a downstream polyadenylation site. Neither the U1 enhancer nor the U1 coding region is essential for recognition of the snRNA 3' end signal. Deletion of the U1 3' end signal from genes with a U1 promoter results in utilization of ""cryptic"" signals resembling the consensus sequence. However, these snRNA gene-promoted transcripts are not polyadenylated, in spite of the functional polyadenylation signal they contain. Thus, the ability to recognize 3' end signals is determined during initiation, presumably by interaction of transcription complexes with specific processing or termination factors."
https://openalex.org/W1500453306,"The binding of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) to fibrin is mediated both by its finger domain and by its kringle-2 domain. In this report, we investigate the relative affinities of these domains for lysine. Human recombinant t-PA deletion-mutant proteins were prepared and their ability to bind to lysine-Sepharose was investigated. Mutants containing the kringle-2 domain bound to lysine-Sepharose, whereas mutants lacking this domain but containing the finger domain, the epidermal growth factor domain or the kringle-1 domain did not bind to lysine-Sepharose. Mutant proteins containing the kringle-2 domain could be specifically eluted from lysine-Sepharose with epsilon-amino caproic acid. This lysine derivative also abolished fibrin binding by the kringle-2 domain but had no effect on the fibrin-binding property of the finger domain. Thus, a lysine-binding site is involved in the interaction of the kringle-2 domain with fibrin but not in the interaction of the finger domain with fibrin. The implications of the nature of these two distinct interactions of t-PA with fibrin on plasminogen activation by t-PA will be discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1496753504,"The gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) agonist muscimol can be photoactivated by 254 nm illumination to affinity label its binding site in the GABAA receptor. We have conducted this reaction on the pure receptor from bovine cerebral cortex in detergent solution, showing that [3H]muscimol can produce then a specific saturable labeling. In the detergent solution, the receptor alone is sensitive to 254 nm irradiation; this reduces the efficiency of incorporation to below that in the membranes, but the competing photoreaction with [3H]muscimol is sufficient and occurs at a representative set of the muscimol-binding sites, such that it can be employed for the photolabeling of those sites. The affinity of [3H]muscimol displayed in this irreversible reaction is indistinguishable from that of its reversible binding. gamma-Aminobutyric acid and bicuculline compete in the photolabeling reaction according to their known affinities at the gamma-aminobutyric acid-binding site. The labeling is shown to occur at the beta-subunit (apparent Mr 57,000) in the pure receptor. The binding sites for gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists, on the beta-subunits, and the benzodiazepine binding sites, on the alpha-subunits, are linked allosterically so that a strongly cooperative hetero-oligomeric structure of this receptor is deduced."
https://openalex.org/W1541731209,"The transport characteristics of aminocephalosporin antibiotics, possessing an alpha-amino group and a carboxyl group, in brush-border membranes isolated from rabbit small intestine have been studied by a rapid filtration technique. The uptake of cephradine by brush-border membrane vesicles was stimulated by the countertransport effect of dipeptides, which indicates the existence of a common carrier transport system. An inward H+ gradient ([pH]i = 7.5 to 8.4, [pH]o = 6.0) stimulated cephradine uptake against a concentration gradient (overshoot phenomenon), and this stimulation was reduced when the H+ gradient was subjected to rapid dissipation by the presence of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, a protonophore. A valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potential (interior-negative) stimulated H+ gradient-dependent cephradine uptake without altering the equilibrium value. The uptake of other aminocephalosporins (cefadroxil, cefaclor, cephalexin) was also stimulated in the presence of an inward H+ gradient, while the uptake of cephalosporins without the alpha-amino group (cefazolin, cefotiam) was not changed in the presence or absence of the H+ gradient. These results suggest that the transport of aminocephalosporins can be driven actively by an inward H+ gradient via the dipeptide transport system in the intestinal brush-border membranes, and that the process results in the transfer of a positive charge."
https://openalex.org/W1559780107,"The temperature and ATP dependence of transport of the vesicular stomatitis virus strain ts045 G protein from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to an early Golgi compartment containing mannosidase I was studied in the mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell clone 15B. Appearance of G protein containing the Man5GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide species occurred after a shift to the permissive temperature with a lag period of 5 min and without detectable formation of the intermediate Man7GlcNAc2 and Man6GlcNAc2 species. Two biochemically distinct transport steps were detected during transport from the ER to the Golgi. An initial step is temperature sensitive, thermoreversible, and requires a high threshold of cellular ATP for maximal rate of transport (80% of the normal cellular ATP pool). Export from the ER is inhibited at 65% of the normal cellular ATP pool. Prolonged incubation at reduced levels of cellular ATP or at the restrictive temperature resulted in the accumulation of G protein in either the Man8GlcNAc2 species or the Man7GlcNAc2 and Man6GlcNAc2 species, respectively. Reversal of the temperature-sensitive block is ATP coupled. A second step is insensitive to incubation at the restrictive temperature and proceeds efficiently when the cellular ATP pool is reduced to 20% of the control. G protein accumulates at this intermediate step during prolonged incubation at 15 degrees C. The data suggest a functional division of processes required for transport of protein between the ER and Golgi compartments. The two steps may reflect the export (budding) and delivery (fusion) of proteins through vesicular trafficking between the ER and Golgi."
https://openalex.org/W1508147662,"Surfactant-associated protein of Mr = 35,000, SAP-35, is the major glycoprotein present in mammalian pulmonary surfactants. In this study, canine SAP-35 and several of its COOH-terminal peptides were purified and characterized by amino acid composition and NH2-terminal sequencing analysis. These proteins were then studied in terms of their specific lipid-binding characteristics and surface activity when combined with a synthetic phospholipid mixture, SM, chosen as an approximation of lung surfactant phospholipids. Purified, delipidated SAP-35 bound SM strongly. In contrast, SAP-21 (a non-collagenous fragment generated by collagenase digestion) bound phospholipid weakly; SAP-18 (an acidic COOH-terminal fragment comprising residues Gly-118 to Phe-231) did not bind phospholipid, demonstrating the importance of hydrophobic amino acid residues Gly-81 to Val-117 and the NH2-terminal collagenous domain in interaction of the SAP-35 with phospholipids. In surface activity experiments, purified SAP-35 enhanced the adsorption of SM phospholipids in terms of both rate and overall surface tension lowering. However, the adsorption facility of the SM-SAP-35 mixture did not approach that of either whole surfactant or the surfactant extract preparations, calf lung surfactant extract or surfactant-TA, used in exogenous surfactant replacement therapy for the neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. In addition, the dynamic surface activity of the SM-SAP-35 mixture was well below that of natural surfactant or surfactant extracts. This was also true of mixtures of SM phospholipids combined with the SAP-18 and SAP-21 fragments of SAP-35."
https://openalex.org/W1510917113,"Physiologic studies suggest that the myocardium from fetal and newborn sheep functions at a higher contractile state with decreased contractile reserve when compared to the myocardium of adult sheep. To investigate the role of Ca2+ transport by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in this phenomenon, we studied functional properties and protein composition of cardiac SR vesicles isolated from fetal and maternal sheep. Active accumulation of Ca2+ and the density of the Ca2+ pump protein were decreased 60% (p less than 0.01) in fetal SR vesicles; however Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity was decreased only 30% (p less than 0.01). This decreased difference in Ca2+-dependent ATPase activities was accounted for by the higher turnover number measured for the Ca2+ pump of fetal SR vesicles (1.6-fold increased, p less than 0.01). Ryanodine, an alkaloid which blocks Ca2+ efflux from cardiac SR vesicles, stimulated Ca2+ uptake more effectively in fetal SR vesicles, suggesting that these vesicles had a higher passive Ca2+ permeability during conditions of active Ca2+ transport. Protein compositional studies showed that the content of phospholamban was decreased in fetal SR vesicles and was correlated with the decrease in the density of Ca2+ pumps. In contrast, the content of calsequestrin and the density of [3H]nitrendipine-binding sites were increased approximately 2-fold in fetal SR vesicles. These functional and compositional differences between SR vesicles isolated from fetal and maternal sheep may indicate that there is relatively more junctional SR in fetal hearts. Since the SR regulates muscle contraction by modulating intracellular Ca2+ concentration, it is possible that developmental alterations in cardiac SR may contribute to the decreased myocardial contractile reserve noted in fetal sheep."
https://openalex.org/W1508438740,"The effects of carbachol on polyphosphoinositides and 1,2-diacylglycerol metabolism were investigated in bovine tracheal smooth muscle by measuring both lipid mass and the turnover of [3H]inositol-labeled phosphoinositides. Carbachol induces a rapid reduction in the mass of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate and a rapid increase in the mass of 1,2-diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid. These changes in lipid mass are sustained for at least 60 min. The level of phosphatidylinositol shows a delayed and progressive decrease during a 60-min period of carbachol stimulation. The addition of atropine reverses these responses completely. Carbachol stimulates a rapid loss in [3H]inositol radioactivity from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate associated with production of [3H]inositol trisphosphate. The carbachol-induced change in the mass of phosphoinositides and phosphatidic acid is not affected by removal of extracellular Ca2+ and does not appear to be secondary to an increase in intracellular Ca2+. These results indicate that carbachol causes phospholipase C-mediated polyphosphoinositide breakdown, resulting in the production of inositol trisphosphate and a sustained increase in the actual content of 1,2-diacylglycerol. These results strongly suggest that carbachol-induced contraction is mediated by the hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides with the resulting generation of two messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol."
https://openalex.org/W1604288926,"Ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was studied to elucidate how Ca2+-mobilizing hormones stimulate the Na+-pump. Stimulation of this uptake was observed with concentrations of vasopressin ([8-arginine]vasopressin, AVP), angiotensin II, and norepinephrine which elicited Ca2+ mobilization and phosphorylase activation. These results suggested that changes in cytosolic Ca2+, mediated by inositol trisphosphate, might trigger sodium pump stimulation by AVP. However, in hepatocytes incubated in Ca2+-free Krebs-Henseleit buffer, Na+-pump activity was not altered over 15 min by either 1.5 mM EGTA or 1.5 mM Ca2+. Furthermore, incubation of cells in 5 mM EGTA for 15-30 min drastically impaired the ability of AVP to increase cytosolic Ca2+, but only modestly attenuated AVP-stimulated Na+-pump activity. Two tumor promoters, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and mezerein, stimulated Na+/K+-ATPase-mediated transport activity. Similarly, addition of synthetic diacylglycerols or of exogenous phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens to increase endogenous diacylglycerol levels also resulted in a stimulation of the Na+-pump in the absence of changes in cytosolic or total cellular Ca2+ levels. Stimulation of the Na+-pump by the combination of maximal concentrations of PMA and AVP did not produce an additive response, and both agents displayed a transient time course, suggesting that the two agents share a common mechanism. Stimulation of the Na+-pump by AVP and PMA was not blocked by amiloride analogs which inhibit Na+/H+ exchange, but these compounds blocked the action of insulin. These data suggest that the elevated Na+/K+-ATPase-mediated transport activity observed in hepatocytes following exposure to Ca2+-mobilizing hormones is a consequence of stimulated diacylglycerol formation and may involve protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1534348553,"Psoralens bind to DNA noncovalently and upon exposure to near UV (320-400 nm) light produce covalent adducts. Thymidine residues in DNA, especially those at 5'-TpA-3' sequences, are most susceptible to the photochemical reaction. This property of the reaction and the recent advances in oligonucleotide synthesis and separation has enabled us to construct DNA fragments containing psoralen adducts at a specific site. The octanucleotide 5'-TCGTAGCT-3' was photoreacted (in the presence of the complementary strand) with the synthetic psoralen 4'-hydroxymethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen to obtain oligonucleotides adducted via the furan or pyrone ring at the internal thymine. These modified octanucleotides were ligated to nonmodified oligonucleotides to obtain a 40-base pair DNA fragment containing a psoralen adduct at a central location. The modified fragment having the thymine-furan side 4'-hydroxymethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen adduct was irradiated with 360 nm of light to produce an interstrand cross-link, and this cross-linked DNA was purified to homogeneity. These uniquely modified DNAs were used as substrates for Escherichia coli ABC excinuclease to determine its incision mechanism unambiguously and to determine the contact sites of the enzyme. ABC excinuclease mediates the cleavage of the 8th and 5th phosphodiester bonds 5' and 3', respectively, to psoralen monoadducts, and the 9th (5') and 3rd (3') phosphodiester bonds to the furan-side thymine of the cross-link. Preliminary DNaseI footprinting studies show that ABC excinuclease protects the whole 40-base pair fragment from DNaseI, and binding of the A and B subunits to the furan side-monoadducted substrate produces two hypersensitive phosphodiester bonds in the vicinity of the 5' incision site of ABC excinuclease."
https://openalex.org/W1564258903,"Tetrameric insulin holoreceptor (alpha 2 beta 2) was reduced with dithiothreitol into alpha beta dimers such that they maintain up to 50% of insulin binding at tracer ligand concentrations. Scatchard analysis of insulin binding to dimers revealed that they had a reduced affinity for ligand by a factor of 3-6 compared to holoreceptor, whereas the maximum number of high affinity binding sites was not affected. The alpha beta dimers can be separated from holoreceptor by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and hence, they are not associated by noncovalent interactions. Insulin-dependent autophosphorylation of alpha beta dimers isolated from low ionic strength sucrose density gradients was minimal and was always accompanied by reoxidation of dimers to the tetrameric holoreceptor. The reformed tetramer exhibited a strong insulin-dependent autophosphorylation reaction. Reoxidation was prevented by isolating alpha beta dimers in sucrose density gradients containing 0.15 M NaCl. Under these conditions, no insulin-dependent autophosphorylation was observed. When insulin receptor was first autophosphorylated and then reduced, receptor kinase activity, as assayed by histone phosphorylation, was not affected. Also, the insulin-independent, basal autophosphorylation was maintained after reduction into alpha beta dimers. We conclude that alpha beta-alpha beta interaction is not necessary for the maintenance of basal kinase activity or for insulin-activated kinase activity once autophosphorylation occurs. However, dimer-dimer interaction appears critical for the insulin-dependent activation of the receptor's intrinsic kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W140584314,"Calpains I and II isolated from diverse tissues possess both Ca2+-independent, and Ca2+-dependent accessible hydrophobic regions. Possible subcellular organelle association of calpains involving these hydrophobic regions was studied. By homogenizing rat tissues directly in Ca2+ (50 microM), about 30-60% of the cytosolic calpain I and II activity reversibly associated with isolated subcellular fractions (microsomal greater than plasma membrane greater than nuclear). After binding to the particulate fraction, calpain II converted to a calpain I-like form exhibiting stronger Ca2+-independent binding to phenyl-Sepharose and a lower Ca2+ requirement for optimal activity. However, it retained its DEAE-cellulose chromatographic pattern, and precipitated with monospecific anti-calpain II antibodies. Although purified calpastatin (endogenous inhibitor) is known to form a Ca2+-dependent complex with calpains, it was not able to reverse the binding of calpains to the particulate fraction upon short incubation. It was, however, effective in blocking calpain binding when the isolated cytosolic fraction or a mixture of purified calpain and calpastatin was preincubated in the presence of Ca2+, and then added to the particulate fraction. Extraction of tissues under controlled conditions revealed that in fact calpains are already loosely associated with subcellular organelles even in the absence of Ca2+. This is the reason why in the crude homogenates with the addition of Ca2+, calpains strongly bind to the particulate fraction without interference by cytosolic calpastatin. Although calpastatin by complexing initially to calpain can prevent the association of this protease with subcellular organelles, it cannot dissociate calpains already bound to these subcellular fractions. By prior Ca2+-independent association with the hydrophobic proteins present in the subcellular fractions, calpains overcome the 3- to 30-fold inhibitory excess of calpastatin in tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1480653299,"Using cloned (dG-dA)n X (dC-dT)n DNA duplexes [GA)n) as models of homopurine-homopyrimidine S1-hypersensitive sites, we show that cleavage of the alternate (non-B, non-Z) DNA structure by S1 nuclease is length-dependent, in both supercoiled and linear forms, which are similar because of the identity of their nicking profiles. However, the length of flanking sequences, the presence of borders, and the DNA topology affect the equilibrium between the alternate structure and B-DNA. The B form of (GA)38 has a 10.4-base pair helical repeat, but the two phosphodiester backbones have different conformations (heteronomous DNA with a dinucleotide repeat unit). Extension experiments reveal that the alternate structure is also heteronomous, in agreement with the nicking patterns generated by S1 and mung bean nucleases and by venom phosphodiesterase. Sensitivity to the latter enzyme at pH 9.0 indicates that the alternate DNA does not appear only in the low pH of the S1 nuclease reaction. Moreover, Hoogsteen G-CH+ base-pairing does not seem to be a prerequisite for the appearance of sensitivity because S1 still recognizes the structure even when all Gs are methylated at N-7. This is consistent with the results of chemical probing of the structure using dimethyl sulfate and diethyl pyrocarbonate at various pH values, which show absence of protection at guanine N-7. However, diethyl pyrocarbonate treatment at low pH results in hyper-reactivity of A residues."
https://openalex.org/W1625058931,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptors were solubilized using the nondenaturing detergent Triton X-100 after occupancy of rat liver membrane-bound receptors with 125I-VIP. Gel filtration and ultracentrifugation on sucrose density gradients revealed the existence in the soluble macromolecular fraction of two labeled components: a major (80%) heavy component and a minor (20%) light one. The two components exhibit the following hydrodynamic parameters: Stokes radius, 5.8 nm: s20,w, 5.98 s; Mr, 150,000; frictional ratio, 1.52 for the major; and Stokes radius, 3.0 nm: s20,w, 3.98 s; Mr = 52,000; frictional ratio, 1.12 for the minor component. The labeling of these components was specific in that it dramatically decreased when unlabeled VIP was added together with 125I-VIP. The pharmacological specificity was also assessed by using 10 nM histidylisoleucineamide (a VIP agonist). Many lines of evidence indicate that the light component (Mr = 52,000) is the VIP-receptor complex while the heavy component (Mr = 150,000) is a ternary complex consisting of VIP, the receptor, and a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, probably Ns. GTP is required to dissociate 125I-VIP from the heavy component whereas it is ineffective on the light component. This effect is nucleotide specific. After cholera toxin-induced [32P]ADP ribosylation of liver membranes, a high peak of 32P radioactivity containing the alpha subunit (Mr = 42,000) of the Ns protein is coeluted with the heavy component on Sephacryl S-300. By mild urea (2 M) treatment, the heavy component is converted into the light without significant dissociation of 125I-VIP. When a Triton extract of membranes prelabeled with 125I-VIP is treated with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) subsequent sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis reveals a major band corresponding to Mr = 150,000. Alternatively, when prelabeled membranes are directly treated with the cross-linker, a major complex of Mr = 51,000 is observed. This may be related to different accessibility of the cross-linker to the site at which the receptor and the Ns protein interact in the two conditions. In conclusion, these data represent initial reports on the successful solubilization of functional VIP-receptor complexes and provide evidence for an interaction between liver VIP-receptor complexes and a GTP-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1587863598,"Wild-type Azotobacter vinelandii strain UW was transformed with plasmid pDB12 to produce a species (LS10) unable to synthesize the structural proteins of component 1 and component 2 of native nitrogenase. A spontaneous mutant of this strain was isolated (LS15) which can grow by nitrogen fixation in the presence or absence of either Mo or W. It is proposed that LS15 fixes nitrogen solely by an alternative nitrogen-fixing system which previously has been hypothesized to exist in A. vinelandii. Under nitrogen-fixing conditions, LS15 synthesizes a protein similar to component 2 (Av2) of native nitrogenase in that it can complement native component 1 (Av1) for enzymatic activity. Isolation and characterization of this second component 2 shows it to be a 4Fe-4S protein of molecular mass about 62 kDa and is antigenically similar to Av2. This protein is also similar to Av2 in that in the reduced state it possesses a rhombic ESR spectrum in the g = 2 region, which changes to an axial spectrum upon addition of MgATP. It is suggested that this second Fe-protein is associated with the alternative nitrogen-fixing system in A. vinelandii."
https://openalex.org/W1606791548,"A covalent complex between purified rat liver microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and horse cytochrome c was formed through cross-linking studies with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide at low ionic strength. The purified cross-linked derivative shows that this product is a 1:1 complex containing one molecule each of the flavoprotein and cytochrome. The covalent complex had almost completely blocked the electron transfer from NADPH to exogenous cytochrome c or the rabbit liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 induced by phenobarbital, indicating that the cross-linked cytochrome c covers the electron-accepting site of the reductase. These results suggest that the covalently cross-linked derivative is a valid model of the noncovalent electron transfer complex. Although the exact number and site of the cross-linked location were not determinable, in cytochrome c the amide bond originates from Lys-13 and in reductase it might be at any one of six different side chain carboxyl groups in the two neighboring cluster acidic residues, Asp-207, -208, and -209, and Glu-213, Glu-214, and Asp-215. It is therefore proposed that the six clustered carboxyl groups on reductase are in an exposed location near the area where one heme edge comes close to the molecular surface."
https://openalex.org/W1497805203,"The neuropeptides arginine vasopressin and oxytocin are generated from their prohormones in the hypothalamoneurohypophysial system by enzymatic cleavages at paired basic residues (i.e. Lys-Arg). This study describes the purification of an enzyme from bovine neural lobe secretory vesicles, the putative site of this processing, which is capable of cleaving several prohormones at paired basic residues. The enzyme is a glycoprotein of Mr approximately 70,000 and has an acidic pH maximum. It processes the heterologous precursors pro-opiomelanocortin and insulin at paired basic residues in a manner similar to a pro-opiomelanocortin-converting enzyme derived from bovine intermediate lobe secretory vesicles which has been described previously. In addition, the neural lobe-derived converting enzyme cleaves the human vasopressin prohormone in vitro to yield arginine vasopressin-Gly10-Lys11-Arg12 as the major vasopressin cleavage product. This indicates that the enzymatic cleavage in the vasopressin precursor occurred primarily on the carboxyl side of the arginine in the pair of Lys-Arg basic residues separating the vasopressin peptide from the neurophysin moiety in the precursor. The properties of the neural and intermediate lobe-derived enzymes are virtually identical, raising the possibility that a family of similar enzymes may be responsible for cleaving a number of prohormones at paired basic residues in different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1534685762,"The oligosaccharide processing intermediates of the vesicular stomatitis virus strain ts045 G protein were used to identify ATP- and temperature-sensitive steps in the constitutive pathway of protein transfer to the cell surface. In addition to the initial ATP-sensitive step required for export from the endoplasmic reticulum (Balch, W. E., Elliott, M. M., and Keller, D. S. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 14681-14689), two distinct ATP-sensitive steps functionally dissect the Golgi into at least 3 compartments: a cis compartment containing the trimming enzyme mannosidase I, a medial compartment conferring resistance to endoglycosidase H, and a trans compartment containing terminal glycosyl transferases. A fourth ATP-sensitive step is required for export of G protein from the trans Golgi to the cell surface. A high threshold of cellular ATP (70% of the control) was required for maximal rates of transport between Golgi compartments. Transport between compartments is inhibited at 40% of the normal cellular ATP pool. Only a single temperature-sensitive step localized to the endoplasmic reticulum inhibited transport of ts045 G protein to the cell surface. The data suggest that ATP-sensitive steps punctuate transport of protein between compartmental boundaries of the secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1536062608,"Membrane vesicles prepared from rabbit distal colon were used to study colonic transport mechanisms. Differential and sucrose-Ficoll density gradient centrifugation of the mucosal homogenate yielded fractions which supported ATP-dependent proton transport, as measured with the fluorescent weak base acridine orange. Quenching of acridine orange absorbance in light microsomes and microsome-derived density gradient fractions was MgATP-dependent and was reversed with nigericin; these characteristics suggest the presence of one or more ATP-driven proton pumps. Proton transport in the microsomal fraction was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide more than by orthovanadate, and was dependent on extravesicular chloride. Vesicles in a microsome-derived gradient fraction were inhibited by orthovanadate more than by N-ethylmaleimide. N-ethylmaleimide pretreatment of this gradient fraction uncovered a vesicle population with characteristics similar to the gastric H+,K+ATPase: proton transport was abolished by orthovanadate and the experimental anti-ulcer drug SCH 28080, was enhanced by potassium, and was not affected by chloride. ATP-generated proton gradients in this fraction were not dissipated by the proton ionophore 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide. We conclude that two ATP-driven proton pumps are present in mucosa from distal rabbit colon; one with characteristics of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive organelle associated proton pumps, and one similar to the gastric proton-potassium exchanger."
https://openalex.org/W1549651357,"A new method based on the toxicity of low intracellular pH (pHi) was developed to isolate fibroblast variants overexpressing Na+/H+ antiport activity. Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (CCL39) were incubated for 60 min in medium containing 50 mM NH4Cl. Removal of external NH+4 induced a rapid and lethal intracellular acidification when the Na+/H+ antiporter was inhibited during the 60 min of the pHi recovery phase. The inhibition was provoked either by adding 5-(N-methyl,N-propyl)amiloride (MPA, LD50 = 0.3 microM) or by reducing external [Na+] (LD50 = 25 mM). Progressively increasing the MPA concentration during the acid-load selection led to the isolation of two stable variants: AR40 and AR300, resistant, respectively, to 40 and 300 microM MPA. In response to an acid-load, these variants display a much higher rate of pHi recovery due to an overexpression of Na+/H+ antiport activity. In addition, AR40 and AR300 have an altered Na+/H+ antiporter: in AR300 cells K0.5 of MPA for inhibiting Na+/H+ exchange is shifted from 5 X 10(-8) to 1.5 X 10(-6) M, Km (Na+) is decreased 2-fold, and Vmax is increased 4.5-fold. Alternatively reducing Na+ concentration of the pHi recovery saline medium in a stepwise manner led to the selection of another class of variants (DD8 and DD12) also characterized by an altered Na+/H+ antiporter and an increased expression level. The 10-fold increased rate of amiloride-sensitive Na+ influx of DD12 is accounted for by a 4-fold increase in Vmax and a 2.5-fold increase in affinity for Na+ or Li+ at the external site. Interestingly, the affinity for the amiloride analog MPA and for external H+ is unchanged in DD12. In conclusion, the genetic approach presented here: provides a general and specific method for selecting variants of the Na+/H+ antiporter with increased expression levels and/or with structural alterations and demonstrates that the external Na+- and amiloride-binding sites are not identical, since they can be genetically altered independently of each other."
https://openalex.org/W1535191554,"A 41,000-dalton Ca2+-sensitive actin-modulating protein has been purified from rabbit alveolar macrophages using ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. On sodium dodecyl-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, this macrophage protein migrates more rapidly than actin and fails to cross-react with polyclonal anti-actin antibody. It has a Stokes radius of 3.0 nm and an isoelectric point of 6.6. In the presence of micromolar Ca2+ this 41,000-Da protein: reduces the viscosity of polymerized actin, nucleates actin filament assembly, causes a nearly instantaneous increase in fluorescence intensity of subcritical concentrations of pyrenyl-actin (estimated KD of the pyrene actin-macrophage protein complex, 5 X 10(-8) M), increases the critical concentration of actin by 0.65 microM (molar ratios of protein/actin, 1/100-1/10), blocks actin monomer depolymerization from the barbed filament ends, and does not sever preformed actin filaments. The ability of this protein to block filament ends is rapidly and completely inhibited by lowering free calcium ion concentration below the micromolar range."
https://openalex.org/W1546325070,"Protein phosphorylations are rapidly induced in intact B cells by antibodies to surface immunoglobulin (anti-IgM) and by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). A comparison of the molecular weight, isoelectric points, phosphopeptides, and phosphoamino acids of the phosphoproteins induced by anti-IgM and by PMA suggests that anti-IgM acts through the activation of protein kinase C. This conclusion is strengthened by the observation that prolonged treatment with PMA ablates the ability of anti-IgM to induce phosphorylation, presumably by depleting cellular protein kinase C. Furthermore, the effects of dibutyryl cyclic AMP on protein phosphorylation are quite distinct from the effects of anti-IgM. The six most prominent phosphoproteins induced by PMA, with approximate Mr values of 47, 55, 62, 68, 68, and 65-70 X 10(3), are associated with the plasma membrane. Of these, four are apparently associated with the cytoskeleton, suggesting that the phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins may be important events early in B cell activation. Examination of protein phosphorylation in cell lines derived from different tissues has identified one major B cell phosphoprotein (Mr 65-70 X 10(3), which is absent in T cells, and two phosphoproteins (Mr 55 and 68 X 10(3), which are observed in cells of hematopoietic origin but which are absent or uncommon in other cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1585703295,"We have investigated the simultaneous regulation of cell surface distribution and ligand binding of the asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) receptor and the transferrin receptor in a hepatoma cell line by phorbol esters. One hour exposure to phorbol esters causes a redistribution of both receptors to the cell interior as shown by radioligand binding at 4 degrees C and selective immunoprecipitation from the plasma membrane. This effect is temperature- and dose-dependent and is not seen with 4-alpha-phorbol, an inactive tumor promoter. The mechanism and kinetics of the ASGP receptor response to phorbol esters appears to differ from that of the transferrin receptor in this cell line. Within the first 10 min there is a decrease in binding of iodinated ligands for both receptors to the HepG2 cell surface. For the transferrin receptor this results from a net internalization of receptor molecules from the plasma membrane pool, while for the ASGP receptor this decrease is accounted for by a 3.5-fold reduction in ligand binding affinity (6.6 X 10(-8) M to 24.0 X 10(-8) M), with essentially no change in the number of ASGP receptors recoverable from the plasma membrane pool by immunoprecipitation. The altered affinity of the ASGP-R is transient; the Kd returns to control levels by 20 min of continued exposure to the agent. The transferrin receptor shows no change in binding affinity during the course of exposure to phorbol esters. ASGP receptors in cells exposed to phorbol esters for 1 h maintain their competence to deliver exogenous ligand to intracellular sites of degradation and to participate in the recycling pathway of receptor-mediated endocytosis, although at a lower rate than in control cells. We conclude that under identical conditions phorbol esters modulate the binding capacity of two receptors at the cell surface by separate mechanisms. Furthermore, the transient nature of the altered ASGP-R binding affinity suggests that at least two mechanisms, receptor redistribution as well as decreased binding affinity, are operative in the modulation of ASGP-R cell surface binding during the first hour of exposure to the phorbol esters."
https://openalex.org/W1594188065,"The lipid cofactor requirement of Escherichia coli sn-1,2-diacylglycerol kinase was studied using a beta-octylglucoside mixed micellar assay (Walsh, J. P., and Bell, R. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 6239-6247). The enzyme was shown to have an absolute requirement for a lipid activator. sn-1,2-Dioleoylglycerol was both an activator and a substrate for the enzyme, 1,3-dioleoylglycerol was an activator but not a substrate, and sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol was a substrate but not an activator. Activation was observed with a large number of phospholipids, sulfolipids, neutral lipids, and detergents. Lipids with longer alkyl/acyl chains stimulated activity to a greater extent and at lower concentrations than their shorter chain homologs. Anionic lipids were the best activators, and neutral lipids were somewhat less effective. Cationic lipids were poor activators. Lipid activation was cooperative in all cases, with Hill coefficients ranging from 2.9 to 4.7. Lipid activators stabilized the enzyme against inactivation induced by diacylglycerols. The effectiveness of several lipids in stabilizing the enzyme correlated with their effectiveness as kinetic activators, suggesting a common mechanism. Kinetic analyses also suggested that a lipid cofactor-induced conformational change occurs as a part of the activation process. beta-Octylglucoside was shown not to function as a lipid cofactor for diacylglycerol kinase. The requirement for detergent in the assay was related, instead, to the need to disperse and deliver water-insoluble substrates and cofactors to the enzyme. beta-Octylglucoside also provided an inert matrix to which lipid substrates and cofactors could be added, enabling study of their concentration dependencies."
https://openalex.org/W2141888986,"A rabbit lung cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) prepared by successive chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and G-200 Sephadex columns in the presence of EGTA was activated by Ca2+ and contained calmodulin (CaM), suggesting that the enzyme exists as a stable CaM X PDE complex (Sharma, R. K., and Wirch, E. (1979) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 91, 338-344). An enzyme with similar properties was demonstrated to exist in bovine lung extract. C1, a monoclonal antibody previously shown to react with the 60-kDa subunit of bovine brain PDE isozymes (Sharma, R. K., Adachi, A.-M., Adachi, K., and Wang, J. H.) (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 9248-9254), cross-reacted with the lung enzyme. Purification of the lung enzyme by C1 antibody immunoaffinity chromatography rendered the enzyme dependent on exogenous CaM for Ca2+ stimulation. Further purification was achieved by CaM affinity chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified enzyme showed a predominant polypeptide of Mr 58,000 and a minor band of about 50,000. The purified enzyme could be reconstituted into a PDE X CaM complex upon incubation with CaM in the presence of either Ca2+ or EGTA. The reconstituted protein complex did not dissociate in buffers containing 0.1 mM EGTA. Analysis of the purified and reconstituted lung phosphodiesterase by Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration indicated that the lung enzyme is a dimeric protein and that the reconstituted enzyme contained two molecules of calmodulin. Analysis of the reconstituted phosphodiesterase by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis also showed it to contain equimolar calmodulin and the enzyme subunit. The CaM antagonists, fluphenazine, compound 48/80, and calcineurin at concentrations abolishing CaM stimulation of bovine brain PDE had little effect on the activity of reconstituted bovine lung phosphodiesterase."
https://openalex.org/W1545221250,"The effect of insulin on rat adipocytes was studied in isotonic buffers (pH 7.4) containing NaCl, CaCl2, MgSO4, KCl, and bovine serum albumin but no phosphate or bicarbonate anions. In phosphate- and bicarbonate-free buffers the dose-response curve to insulin is shifted to the right, the effects of the hormone on hexose uptake, glucose metabolism, and inhibition of lipolysis being observed at much higher (nearly 2 orders of magnitude) concentrations of insulin. The insulin binding capacity of the cells is only slightly changed. The dose-response curve for isoproterenol which stimulates lipolysis in the same cell type is almost the same in both Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer and phosphate- and bicarbonate-free buffers. The dose-response curves for agents that mimic the action of insulin such as wheat germ agglutinin or vanadate ions are also shifted to the right. The dose-response curve to insulin can be returned to normal by readdition of either bicarbonate or phosphate. Almost complete recovery is obtained at either 10 mM bicarbonate or 24 mM phosphate, respectively. External Ca2+ ions which are not required for the proper action of insulin in fat cells maintained in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, become essential for insulin action in bicarbonate-free buffer. The study indicates that depletion of bicarbonate and, to a lesser extent, phosphate anions, interferes with an essential insulin-dependent post-binding event. Also, in bicarbonate-free medium, external Ca2+ ions are essential for insulin-mediated processes. The implications of this study to the mode of action of insulin, and to physiological and clinical states of insulin desensitization are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1567847158,"We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence for TEF-1, one of three genes coding for elongation factor (EF)-1 alpha in Mucor racemosus. The deduced EF-1 alpha protein contains 458 amino acids encoded by two exons. The presence of an intervening sequence located near the 3' end of the gene was predicted by the nucleotide sequence data and confirmed by alkaline S1 nuclease mapping. The amino acid sequence of EF-1 alpha was compared to the published amino acid sequences of EF-1 alpha proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Artemia salina. These proteins shared nearly 85% homology. A similar comparison to the functionally analogous EF-Tu from Escherichia coli revealed several regions of amino acid homology suggesting that the functional domains are conserved in elongation factors from these diverse organisms. Secondary structure predictions indicated that alpha helix and beta sheet conformations associated with the functional domains in EF-Tu are present in the same relative location in EF-1 alpha from M. racemosus. Through this comparative structural analysis we have predicted the general location of functional domains in EF-1 alpha which interact with GTP and tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1522073167,"Protein phosphatases involved in cellular regulation have been categorized functionally into two major types by substrate specificity and sensitivity to protein inhibitors. In this classification type-1 phosphatases are inhibited by the heat-stable protein inhibitor-2 (I-2), whereas type-2 phosphatases are considered insensitive to inhibition by this protein. This study demonstrates that the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of both purified type-1 and type-2 catalytic subunits can be blocked by micromolar concentrations of I-2. Heparin also was more effective at inhibiting the type-1 compared to type-2 phosphatase but required thousandfold higher concentrations than I-2. The specificity of the interaction with I-2 indicates that the tertiary structures of the two phosphatase catalytic subunits closely resemble one another. However, only the type-1, not the type-2, protein phosphatase activity was neutralized by immunoglobulins affinity-purified against the Mr = 33,000 catalytic fragment of the type-1 phosphatase. Preparations of rabbit skeletal muscle type-1 phosphatase catalytic fragment and of bovine cardiac type-2 phosphatase catalytic subunit were compared by Western immunoblotting with sheep polyclonal and mouse monoclonal immunoglobulins raised against the respective proteins. Monoclonal anti-type-2 immunoglobulins preferentially stained the type-2 phosphatase catalytic subunit used as antigen, but displayed cross-reaction with 10-50 times more of the type-1 phosphatase. In contrast, as found with their effects on activity, sheep anti-type-1 immunoglobulins were specific; immunoblotting detected the type-1, not the type-2, catalytic protein. We conclude that the two catalytic proteins have at least one common primary structural epitope recognized by the monoclonal immunoglobulins. These data, taken together with other recent immunochemical results, support a hypothesis that this family of enzymes was derived from a common ancestral protein phosphatase catalytic subunit."
https://openalex.org/W110017209,"The irreversible effects of pressure (1-2000 atm) upon the enzymatic activity and structure of the Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum were investigated. Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles suspended in a medium of 0.1 M KCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM EGTA irreversibly lose their Ca2+ transport and Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activities on exposure to pressures of 800-2000 atmospheres. The pressure-induced inactivation of Ca2+-ATPase is accompanied by inhibition of the formation of phosphorylated enzyme intermediate, an increase in the passive Ca2+ permeability of the membrane, and structural changes in the Ca2+-ATPase as shown by disruption of Ca2+-ATPase membrane crystals, increased susceptibility to tryptic digestion, unmasking of SH groups, and loss of the conformational responses to Ca2+ and vanadate. The sensitivity to pressure is influenced by enzyme conformation. Ca2+ or vanadate + EGTA protect the Ca2+-ATPase against pressure-induced inactivation, implying a greater stability of the enzyme in the E1 and E2 states than in the conformational equilibrium that prevails at low [Ca2+] in the absence of vanadate. Protection against pressure inactivation was also observed in the presence of sucrose, glycerol, ethylene glycol and 1 M KCl, suggesting that water density modifying groups significantly affect the stability of Ca2+-ATPase under pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2186882883,"Considerable disagreement has resulted from experiments designed to test whether light-induced falls in cGMP in outer segment (OS) of photoreceptors precede their light-induced electrical responses. Different studies have reported initial declines at 50 ms, at s, or not at all for physiological stimuli. Such studies have employed whole retinas, isolated rod OS, or isolated rod OS with attached inner segments and involved a variety of techniques. We developed an apparatus that illuminates intact pieces of dark-adapted frog retinas at 22 degrees C for known brief durations and then rapidly (47 ms) presses their OS surface against a copper mirror cooled by liquid helium. Freezing occurs in less than 2 ms. Cyclic GMP was then assayed in cryostat sections of the OS layer. Six illumination intensities that bleached from 90 to 9 X 10(8) rhodopsin molecules per s were delivered for durations of 0.1-2 s. Compared to dark-adapted values, progressive losses of cGMP were seen with all illumination intensities. Because a significant loss in cGMP was seen after a 100 ms exposure to our dimmest stimulus, it appears that a loss of cGMP could play a role in rod visual transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1529241707,"The human asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) is a membrane glycoprotein which participates in receptor-mediated endocytosis and delivery of its ligands to lysosomes for degradation. In order to examine the pathways and mechanisms responsible for the turnover and degradation of the ASGP-R we have followed the fate of the ASGP-R in HepG2 cells during exposure to anti-receptor antibody as well as inhibitors of lysosomal processing and receptor recycling. Incubation of cells at 37 degrees C with anti-ASGP-R antibody results in the rapid (t 1/2 30 min) loss of mature 46,000-Da ASGP-R (control, t 1/2 20 h). This process requires whole IgG, since Fab fragments do not induce loss of receptor. Furthermore, this antibody-induced loss is specific, since incubation with antibody to the transferrin receptor does not alter cellular ASGP-R content. Of note, weak bases (e.g. primaquine) abrogate this antibody-induced loss of ASGP-R. Inhibitors of lysosomal proteases (EC64 and leupeptin) do not alter this antibody-mediated loss. Furthermore, this effect occurs at 18 degrees C, a temperature at which delivery of ligand to the lysosome is blocked. Thus, the present observations suggest a unique pathway for antibody-induced ASGP-R loss which is distinct from the pathway of lysosomal delivery of ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1541397643,"Glutathione (GSH) was oxidized to GSSG in the presence of H2O2, tyrosine, and peroxidase. During the GSH oxidation catalyzed by lactoperoxidase, O2 was consumed and the formation of glutathione free radical was confirmed by ESR of its 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide adduct. When lactoperoxidase was replaced by thyroid peroxidase in the reaction system, the consumption of O2 and the formation of the free radical became negligibly small. These results led us to conclude that, in the presence of H2O2 and tyrosine, lactoperoxidase and thyroid peroxidase caused the one-electron and two-electron oxidations of GSH, respectively. It was assumed that GSH is oxidized by primary oxidation products of tyrosine, which are phenoxyl free radicals in lactoperoxidase reactions and phenoxyl cations in thyroid peroxidase reactions. When tyrosine was replaced by diiodotyrosine or 2,6-dichlorophenol, the difference in the mechanism between lactoperoxidase and thyroid peroxidase disappeared and both caused the one-electron oxidation of GSH. Iodides also served as an effective mediator of GSH oxidation coupled with the peroxidase reactions. In this case the two peroxidases both caused the two-electron oxidation of GSH."

Neither sodium-independent [3H]choline uptake nor [3H]acetylcholine release was affected by up to 10 micrograms/ml anti-Ub, indicating that the cholinergic terminals were not depolarized by the anti-Ub. Binding of anti-Ub to synaptosomes, as measured with 125I-protein A, was saturable and occurred over the same concentration range (1-10 micrograms/ml) at which uptake inhibition was observed. Although preimmune IgG bound to the synaptosome preparation to a greater extent and was apparently not readily saturable, this fortuitous binding was without effect on high affinity choline uptake and conversion to acetylcholine. The results suggest the presence of a ubiquitin-protein conjugate on the synaptosomal surface and a functional relationship between this protein conjugate and the sodium-dependent choline transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1488742914,"To examine the involvement of Na+ ions in adrenergic responses in brown adipose tissue, a method is described for measuring Na+ influx into isolated brown adipocytes, using short (30 s) incubations with 22Na+, followed by a two-step centrifugation recovery procedure. Using this method, a clear norepinephrine-stimulated accumulation of intracellular 22Na+ was observed, which was enhanced by the addition of ouabain, was insensitive to amiloride (a Na+/H+ exchange blocker), and could not be mimicked by the total removal of oxygen from the incubation medium. The norepinephrine-stimulated Na+ influx was dose-dependent for the hormone with an EC50 of 250 nM, was blocked by the beta-antagonist propranolol but not by the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin, and could be induced by adrenergic agonists with the order of potency: isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine greater than phenylephrine, indicating a beta-receptor-mediated process. The Na+ influx was found to be cAMP-dependent since it could be induced by both theophylline (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) and forskolin (an adenylate cyclase activator), but it was independent of other known cellular cAMP-dependent responses since neither addition of fatty acid substrates (octanoate or palmitate), nor of the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-hydrazone could induce the phenomenon, despite having significant stimulatory effects on cellular respiration. Furthermore, total respiratory inhibition with rotenone, or total oxygen depletion of the medium with dithionite, did not prevent the normal norepinephrine-induced Na+ influx. The possibility that this beta-mediated norepinephrine-stimulated Na+ influx plays an important physiological role in brown adipose tissue activity is discussed, perhaps as one of the, as yet undefined, signals initiating tissue growth in the chronically beta-stimulated tissue of animals facing long-term increases in thermogenic demands."
https://openalex.org/W1553538033,"We have determined the sequence of the gene encoding the large subunit of Escherichia coli exonuclease VII (xseA) and the amino acid sequence of the protein it encodes. The coding region of the xseA gene is 1368 base pairs. The protein encoded by the gene contains 456 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 51,823. The promoter for xseA is close to that for guaB, and these two genes are transcribed in opposite directions: xseA clockwise and guaB counterclockwise on the standard E. coli genetic map. The cloned xseA gene can complement an xseA deletion mutant strain. In an xseA+ genetic background production of large quantities of the xseA gene product appeared to decrease the amount of exonuclease VII activity in cell extracts. In fact, no exonuclease VII activity at all could be detected following induction of strains in which the xseA gene was under lambda pL regulation. These observations suggest that the proper ratio of the large and small exonuclease VII subunits must be maintained in order to produce active enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1601219199,"When cytochrome c oxidase is isolated from mitochondria, the purified enzyme requires both cytochrome c and O2 to achieve its maximum rate of internal electron transfer from cytochrome a to cytochrome a3. When reductants other than cytochrome c are used, the rate of internal electron transfer is very slow. In this paper we offer an explanation for the slow reduction of cytochrome a3 when reductants other than cytochrome c are used and for the apparent allosteric effects of cytochrome c and O2. Our model is based on the conventional understanding of cytochrome oxidase mechanism (i.e. electron transfer from cytochrome a/CuA to cytochrome a3/CuB), but assumes a relatively rapid two-electron transfer between cytochrome a/CuA and cytochrome a3/CuB and a thermodynamic equilibrium in the resting enzyme (the enzyme as isolated) which favors reduced cytochrome a and oxidized cytochrome a3. Using the kinetic constants that are known for this reaction, we find that the activating effects of O2 and cytochrome c on the rate of electron transfer from cytochrome a to cytochrome a3 conform to the predictions of the model and so provide no evidence of any allosteric effects or control of cytochrome c oxidase by O2 or cytochrome c."

Quinoxy radical BO. from homolysis of the O-O bond reacted by competing pathways; beta-scission yielded 2,6-di-t-butyl-p-benzoquinone, and rearrangement with ring-expansion produced an oxacycloheptadienone free radical (X(.)). This rearranged radical was stabilized by the captodative effect that facilitated competitive interactions with the P-450 iron-oxo complexes formed during O-O bond scission. Approximately 15% of X(.) was captured by oxygen rebound with a hydroxyl radical from the P-450 complex (FeOH)3+ to form a hemiketal, that led to the ring-contracted product 2,5-di-t-butyl-5-(2'-oxopropyl)-4-oxa-2-cyclopentenone by spontaneous rearrangement. The major fraction of X(.), however, underwent electron transfer oxidation to form the corresponding cation. Hydration of this cation produced the ring-contracted product, and proton elimination (or, alternatively, direct H(.) removal from X(.) led to the product 2,7-di-t-butyl-4-methylene-5-oxacyclohepta-2,6-dienone. The findings indicate that cytochrome P-450 intermediate complexes are mainly responsible for oxidation of X(.). The results complement our previous study with 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-hydroperoxy-4-methyl-2,5-cyclohexadienone (Thompson, J. A., and Wand, M. D. (1985) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1590417152,"Abstract We have isolated various phospholipids from adrenal mitochondria of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-treated (stimulated) and cycloheximide/ACTH-treated (unstimulated) rats. When the effects of these phospholipids were examined on the formation of pregnenolone from endogenous cholesterol by adrenal mitochondria of unstimulated rats, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine from stimulated mitochondria were effective in enhancing the cleavage reaction in unstimulated mitochondria, whereas these phospholipids from unstimulated mitochondria were all ineffective. Cardiolipins from both stimulated and unstimulated mitochondria were effective. When the compositional changes in fatty acid moiety of phospholipids were examined, a significant increase in C22:4 (adrenic) acid was observed only for phosphatidylethanolamine under the influence of ACTH. A linear relationship between the contents of C22:4 acid in various phospholipids and respective steroidogenic activities was obtained (r = 0.880), suggesting an important role of this fatty acid moiety. The separation of active phosphatidylethanolamine by high performance liquid chromatography revealed that a fraction containing 25% C22:4 acid was most effective in the activation. Based on these results, it is most likely that 1-stearoyl-2-adrenoyl phosphatidylethanolamine is an active species. C22:4 acid was liberated together with C20:4 acid from adrenal triglycerides by the action of ACTH but the liberation was insensitive to cycloheximide inhibition. Finally, cardiolipin which enhances the transfer of cholesterol to cytochrome P-450scc may not be a physiological mediator of ACTH action."
https://openalex.org/W1595596180,"Adenosine 5'-tetraphospho-5'-adenosine (Ap4A) plays a role in cellular metabolism in a wide variety of organisms. Because the divalent cations Mg2+ and Zn2+ are involved in the synthesis and function of Ap4A, the effect of divalent cations on the dinucleotide's conformation is of interest. 1H and 31P chemical shift experiments were carried out as a function of Mg2+ concentration and pH. We propose that Mg2+ stabilizes the unusual ring-stacked conformation of Ap4A at pH greater than 2 by interacting with the beta-phosphates. To further probe conformational effects, stable complexes of Ap4A with Co3+ were studied using 1H and 31P NMR. Co3+ forms two different bidentate complexes with Ap4A, independent of whether the other four octahedral coordination sites are occupied by ammonia or trimethylenediamine. NMR results suggest that in one complex the Co3+ is coordinated to two beta-phosphates and ring stacking is stabilized. In the other complex, Co3+ is coordinated to an alpha-phosphate and its neighboring beta-phosphate and ring stacking is destabilized. These results further support the hypothesis that Mg2+ stabilizes the ring-stacked conformation by interacting symmetrically with the two beta-phosphate groups."
https://openalex.org/W193722426,"Abstract In the preceding paper (Shechter, Y., and Ron, A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 14945-14950) we have shown that in fat cells, prepared and maintained in an isotonic buffer (pH 7.4) containing neither phosphate nor bicarbonate anions (Buffer A), the dose-response curve to insulin shifted to the right by about 2 logarithms and insulin binding affinity or capacity was only slightly decreased. In the current paper we demonstrate that progressive loss of insulin binding, either by treatment with trypsin or preincubating the cells with isoproterenol, correlates well with the reduced ability of the cells to elicit maximal lipogenesis in response to insulin. We further demonstrate in the system that: the dissociation of labeled insulin from fat cells is not accelerated by the inclusion of unlabeled insulin in the medium; termination of lipogenesis in Buffer A occurs immediately; ligand-induced receptor internalization is grossly defective; and insulin is unable to stimulate lipogenesis at 15 degrees C. The data support the hypothesis that in the new experimental system all measurable binding sites are linked to a coupling mechanism. Each site behaves as an independent, separate entity and there are no site to site interactions. This leads to a linear relationship between binding and bioactivation, lack of negative or positive cooperatively, accelerated rate of termination, defective internalization, a shift to the right in the dose-response curve to insulin, and a lack of insulin response at a lower temperature. In more general terms, the study indicates that all measurable insulin receptors are chemically homogeneous in their potential capability to be coupled to an insulin effector (biologically relevant) system, and they do so under particular experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1501321708,"To test the feasibility of synthesizing recombinant peptide hormones by exon deletion and exchange, we have constructed and expressed hybrid human growth hormone (hGH)-rat prolactin (rPrl) genes in which the third and fourth exons of the hGH gene are deleted and separately replaced by the corresponding exons of the rPrl gene. These exon deletion and exon exchange genes were inserted into an SV40 viral vector, packaged, and expressed following acute viral infection of monkey kidney cells. Expression of the hGH gene lacking the third exon (hGHd3) was not detectable at the level of protein production. However, replacement of the deleted third exon in the hGHd3 gene with exon 3 of the rPrl gene (hGHP3) resulted in the efficient synthesis of a secreted chimeric protein. When the fourth exon of the hGH gene was deleted (hGHd4), the encoded protein was found only in the cytosol despite signal sequence processing. Replacement of the deleted fourth exon in this hGHd4 gene with exon 4 of rPrl resulted in the synthesis and secretion of both a chimeric protein (hGHP4) as well as a larger protein corresponding in size to prehGHP4. These results suggest that exon exchange among distantly related genes in the GH family may be used to produce high levels of chimeric GH-related proteins, and regions internal to the hGH protein may be critical in establishing normal protein processing and secretion."

The oATP bound specifically to T-antigen, inhibiting the ATPase activity and preventing T-antigen from activating SV40 DNA replication in vitro. In contrast, binding of oATP had no effect on the DNA-binding activity of T-antigen nor on its ability to form a complex with DNA polymerase alpha. These results provide direct biochemical evidence suggesting that the T-antigen ATPase activity is necessary for viral DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1523009458,"In this paper, we present a new and simple purification of the 36-kDa protein, a major substrate of both viral and growth factor-receptor associated tyrosine protein kinases, and its complex from normal and Schmidt-Ruppin strain Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts that employs a DEAE-Sephacel column and introduces the calcium-dependent adsorption of 36-kDa protein. The use of EGTA step gradients differentially elutes the 36-kDa molecules from the DEAE-Sephacel column. An average total yield of the 36-kDa protein in all fractions approached 80% and represented 0.78% of the [35S] methionine-labeled cellular protein. A purity of 95-99% was obtained with a yield of 60% in the central elution fractions from normal or Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts. Furthermore, 2 mM EGTA elutes poorly phosphorylated molecules while heavily phosphorylated 36-kDa protein requires 4 or 6 M EGTA; a small residual fraction is released at 8-10 mM EGTA. If the EGTA step gradients were neutralized with Ca2+ ion, elution of the 36-kDa protein is inhibited. The complex of the 36-kDa protein and the 6-10-kDa protein may not be dependent on the phosphorylation as the associated 6-10-kDa peptide is seen in all fractions containing the 36-kDa protein. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the 36-kDa protein is increased 2-3-fold following a short term incubation of whole cells with micromolar vanadate. The elution pattern (but not intensity) of the 36-kDa protein obtained from lysates of vanadate-treated cells was identical to untreated cell lysates. The additional phosphorylation appears to result from a recruitment of unphosphorylated 36-kDa protein as the position (but not intensity) of the phosphorylated tryptic peptides is unchanged. We conclude that the function of the 36-kDa protein may be calcium ion-dependent and may be influenced by the phosphorylation state of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1530428914,"Transfer of iron from native porcine uteroferrin to apotransferrin was investigated using EPR spectroscopy. Purple (oxidized) or pink (reduced) forms of uteroferrin were incubated with porcine or human apotransferrin under conditions of temperature (37 degrees C) and pH (6.8) approximating those found in the allantoic fluid of the pregnant sow. Studies were also performed in the presence of mediators such as ascorbate, citrate, and ATP in concentrations previously claimed to be effective in promoting large-scale transfer of iron (Buhi, W. C., Ducsay, C. A., Bazer, F. W., and Roberts, R. M. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 1712-1723). Our experiments indicate that even in the presence of mediators, less than 20% of the iron in uteroferrin is transferred to apotransferrin at the end of 24 h and such transfer may be accompanied by denaturation of uteroferrin. We therefore conclude that the direct transfer of iron to apotransferrin is unlikely to be a physiological role of uteroferrin."
