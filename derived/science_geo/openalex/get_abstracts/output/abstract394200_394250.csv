https://openalex.org/W2139630667,"According to reinforcement learning theory, reward expectation reflects an integration of past rewards over a fixed time scale. Here the authors extract signals about reward memory from neurons in the prefrontal, cingulate and parietal cortex, finding a wide range of time constants across the neuronal population, with a power-law distribution. According to reinforcement learning theory of decision making, reward expectation is computed by integrating past rewards with a fixed timescale. In contrast, we found that a wide range of time constants is available across cortical neurons recorded from monkeys performing a competitive game task. By recognizing that reward modulates neural activity multiplicatively, we found that one or two time constants of reward memory can be extracted for each neuron in prefrontal, cingulate and parietal cortex. These timescales ranged from hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds, according to a power law distribution, which is consistent across areas and reproduced by a 'reservoir' neural network model. These neuronal memory timescales were weakly, but significantly, correlated with those of monkey's decisions. Our findings suggest a flexible memory system in which neural subpopulations with distinct sets of long or short memory timescales may be selectively deployed according to the task demands."
https://openalex.org/W2109596644,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of human type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Although SIRT1 has a therapeutic effect on metabolic deterioration in T2DM, the precise mechanisms by which SIRT1 improves insulin resistance remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SIRT1 in the liver of diet-induced insulin-resistant low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice and of genetically obese ob/ob mice attenuates hepatic steatosis and ameliorates systemic insulin resistance. These beneficial effects were associated with decreased mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity, inhibited the unfolded protein response (UPR), and enhanced insulin receptor signaling in the liver, leading to decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis and improved glucose tolerance. The tunicamycin-in-duced splicing of X-box binding protein-1 and expression of GRP78 and CHOP were reduced by resveratrol in cultured cells in a SIRT1-dependent manner. Conversely, SIRT1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts challenged with tunicamycin exhibited markedly increased mTORC1 activity and impaired ER homeostasi and insulin signaling. These effects were abolished by mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin in human HepG2 cells. These studies indicate that SIRT1 serves as a negative regulator of UPR signaling in T2DM and that SIRT1 attenuates hepatic steatosis, ameliorates insulin resistance, and restores glucose homeostasis, largely through the inhibition of mTORC1 and ER stress.—Li, Y., Xu, S., Giles, A., Nakamura, K., Lee, J.

https://openalex.org/W2083121410,"The Salvador-Warts-Hippo (SWH) pathway was first discovered in Drosophila melanogaster as a potent inhibitor of tissue growth. The SWH pathway is highly conserved between D. melanogaster and mammals, both in function and in the mechanism of signal transduction. The mammalian SWH pathway limits tissue growth by inhibiting the nuclear access and expression of the transcriptional co-activator, Yes-associated protein (YAP). Mutation and altered expression of SWH pathway proteins has been observed in several types of human cancer, but the contribution of these events to tumorigenesis has been unclear. Here we show that YAP can enhance the transformed phenotype of ovarian cancer cell lines and that YAP confers resistance to chemotherapeutic agents that are commonly used to treat ovarian cancer. We find that high nuclear YAP expression correlates with poor patient prognosis in a cohort of 268 invasive epithelial ovarian cancer samples. Segregation by histotype shows that the correlation between nuclear YAP and poor survival is predominantly associated with clear cell tumors, independent of stage. Collectively our findings suggest that YAP derepression contributes to the genesis of ovarian clear cell carcinoma and that the SWH pathway is an attractive therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2148673324,"MicroRNAs (miRs) are emerging as prominent players in the regulation of many biological processes, including myogenic commitment and skeletal muscle formation. Members of the TGF-β family can influence the proliferation and myogenic differentiation of cells, although it is presently not clear what role miRNAs play in the TGF-β-mediated control of myogenic differentiation. Here, we demonstrate in the myogenic C2C12 cell line, and in primary muscle cells, that miR-206 and miR-29-two miRs that act on transcriptional events implicated in muscle differentiation are down-regulated by TGF-β. We further demonstrate that TGF-β treatment of myogenic cells is associated with increased expression of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), a key inhibitor of muscle differentiation that has been identified as a target for regulation by miR-206 and miR-29. We confirmed that increased expression of miR-206 and miR-29 resulted in the translational repression of HDAC4 in the presence or absence of TGF-β via interaction with the HDAC4 3′-untranslated region. Importantly, we found that miR-206 and miR-29 can attenuate the inhibitory actions of TGF-β on myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, we present evidence that the mechanism by which miR-206 and miR-29 can inhibit the TGF-β-mediated up-regulation of HDAC4 is via the inhibition of Smad3 expression, a transducer of TGF-β signaling. These findings identify a novel mechanism of interaction between TGF-β and miR-206 and -29 in the regulation of myogenic differentiation through HDAC4.

https://openalex.org/W2018056175,"Axl is a receptor that induces proliferation, migration and invasion in cancer. In this study, we show that specific microRNAs (miRNAs) target the 3'-UTR of Axl. Luciferase-reporter assays with wild-type and deleted miR-34 and miR-199a/b seed sequences of Axl 3'-UTR confirmed the specificity of targeting. An inverse correlation between Axl protein and miR-34a expression in a panel of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC) and breast cancer (BRC) cell lines was observed, while miR-199a/b expression was completely suppressed. Pre-miR transfection inhibited in vitro migration and invasion and, in vivo, reduced the number of distant lung- or liver-metastases in a chorion-allantoic-membrane (CAM) assay. Moreover, methylation-specific PCR on bisulfite-converted DNA obtained from the cell lines showed that the miR-34a promoter methylation status was inversely correlated with its expression, and that miR-199a/b promoter regions were methylated in all cells tested. In a panel of NSCLC tissues (n=44), miR-34a and miR-199a/b were found to be downregulated and significantly co-expressed. A lower expression of all three miRs was significantly associated with squamous histotypes, and, in a preliminary series, NSCLC patients with miR-34a upregulation showed a positive association towards a longer survival. These results indicate that Axl receptor expression can be regulated by miR-34a and miR-199a/b, which are suppressed by promoter methylation in solid cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2042988034,"Our recent study showed that miR-2861 promotes osteoblast differentiation by targeting histone deacetylase 5, resulting in increased runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) protein production. Here we identified another new microRNA (miRNA) (miR-3960) that played a regulatory role in osteoblast differentiation through a regulatory feedback loop with miR-2861. miR-3960 and miR-2861 were found clustered at the same loci. miR-3960 was transcribed during bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2)-induced osteogenesis of ST2 stromal cells. Overexpression of miR-3960 promoted BMP2-induced osteoblastogenesis. However, the inhibition of miR-3960 expression attenuated the osteoblastogenesis. Homeobox A2 (Hoxa2), a repressor of Runx2 expression, was confirmed to be a target of miR-3960. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that Runx2 bound to the promoter of the miR-3960/miR-2861 cluster. Furthermore, overexpression of Runx2 induced miR-3960/miR-2861 transcription, and block of Runx2 expression attenuated BMP2-induced miR-3960/miR-2861 transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2045605237,"The microtubule-targeting antineoplastic agent, paclitaxel, is highly efficacious against a wide spectrum of human cancers. However, dose-limiting toxicity and development of drug resistance limit its clinical application. Development of novel strategies that overcome chemoresistance and sensitize cancer cells to paclitaxel can enhance the therapeutic effect of this drug. We have previously shown that curcumin, a natural polyphenol, enhances paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity in vitro through downregulation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and Akt pathways. This study was undertaken to determine whether this synergism exists in vivo and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Mouse cervical multistage squamous cell carcinoma model using 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) and a xenograft model of human cervical cancer in nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient (NOD–SCID) mice using HeLa cells were used to evaluate the synergism. We observed that the combined treatment of curcumin and paclitaxel induced a synergestic reduction in the tumor incidence as well as tumor volume of animals compared with the individual treatments of paclitaxel or curcumin, although curcumin alone could not induce any significant effect at the concentration used. The results suggest that a suboptimal concentration of curcumin augments the antitumor action of paclitaxel by downregulating the activation and downstream signaling of antiapoptotic factors and survival signals such as NF-κB, Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases that have significant roles in proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and metastasis. This study revealed for the first time that 3-MC-induced tumorigenesis in mice is associated with a strong constitutive activation of NF-κB activity. Furthermore, we also observed that pre-exposure of carcinoma cells isolated from 3-MC-induced tumors to curcumin potentiates paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Overall, the findings of this preclinical study provide a strong rationale for the validation of this combination through clinical trials. As curcumin could effectively downregulate all these survival signals induced by paclitaxel, we suggest it as a potent chemosensitizer to improve the therapeutic index of paclitaxel."
https://openalex.org/W2024098388,"MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a key regulator of oncogenic processes. It is significantly elevated in the majority of human tumors and functionally linked to cellular proliferation, survival and migration. In this study, we used two experimental-based strategies to search for novel miR-21 targets. On the one hand, we performed a proteomic approach using two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) to identify proteins suppressed upon enhanced miR-21 expression in LNCaP human prostate carcinoma cells. The tumor suppressor acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family, member A (ANP32A) (alias pp32 or LANP) emerged as the most strongly downregulated protein. On the other hand, we applied a mathematical approach to select correlated gene sets that are negatively correlated with primary-miR-21 (pri-miR-21) expression in published transcriptome data from 114 B-cell lymphoma cases. Among these candidates, we found tumor suppressor SMARCA4 (alias BRG1) together with the already validated miR-21 target, PDCD4. ANP32A and SMARCA4, which are both involved in chromatin remodeling processes, were confirmed as direct miR-21 targets by immunoblot analysis and reporter gene assays. Furthermore, knock down of ANP32A mimicked the effect of enforced miR-21 expression by enhancing LNCaP cell viability, whereas overexpression of ANP32A in the presence of high miR-21 levels abrogated the miR-21-mediated effect. In A172 glioblastoma cells, enhanced ANP32A expression compensated for the effects of anti-miR-21 treatment on cell viability and apoptosis. In addition, miR-21 expression clearly increased the invasiveness of LNCaP cells, an effect also seen in part upon downregulation of ANP32A. In conclusion, these results suggest that downregulation of ANP32A contributes to the oncogenic function of miR-21."
https://openalex.org/W2080993329,"Diabetic cardiac dysfunction is associated with decreased rates of myocardial glucose oxidation (GO) and increased fatty acid oxidation (FAO), a fuel shift that has been shown to sensitize the heart to ischemic insult and ventricular dysfunction. We sought to evaluate the metabolic and functional consequences of chronic suppression of GO in heart as modeled by transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (myosin heavy chain (MHC)-PDK4 mice), an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Hearts of MHC-PDK4 mice were shown to exhibit an insulin-resistant substrate utilization profile, characterized by low GO rates and high FAO flux. Surprisingly, MHC-PDK4 mice were not sensitized to cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury despite a fuel utilization pattern that phenocopied the diabetic heart. In addition, MHC-PDK4 mice were protected against high fat diet-induced myocyte lipid accumulation, likely related to increased capacity for FAO. The high rates of mitochondrial FAO in the MHC-PDK4 heart were related to heightened activity of the AMP-activated protein kinase, reduced levels of malonyl-CoA, and increased capacity for mitochondrial uncoupled respiration. The expression of the known AMP-activated protein kinase target, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial function and biogenesis, was also activated in the MHC-PDK4 heart. These results demonstrate that chronic activation of PDK4 triggers transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms that re-program the heart for chronic high rates of FAO without the expected deleterious functional or metabolic consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2045626973,"Almost all viral pathogens utilize a cytoskeleton for their entry and intracellular transport. In HIV-1 infection, binding of the virus to blood resting CD4 T cells initiates a temporal course of cortical actin polymerization and depolymerization, a process mimicking the chemotactic response initiated from chemokine receptors. The actin depolymerization has been suggested to promote viral intracellular migration through cofilin-mediated actin treadmilling. However, the role of the virus-mediated actin polymerization in HIV infection is unknown, and the signaling molecules involved remain unidentified. Here we describe a pathogenic mechanism for triggering early actin polymerization through HIV-1 envelope-mediated transient activation of the LIM domain kinase (LIMK), a protein that phosphorylates cofilin. We demonstrate that HIV-mediated LIMK activation is through gp120-triggered transient activation of the Rack-PAK-LIMK pathway, and that knockdown of LIMK through siRNA decreases filamentous actin, increases CXCR4 trafficking, and diminishes viral DNA synthesis. These results suggest that HIV-mediated early actin polymerization may directly regulate the CXCR4 receptor during viral entry and is involved in viral DNA synthesis. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that in resting CD4 T cells, actin polymerization can be triggered through transient treatment with a pharmacological agent, okadaic acid, that activates LIMK and promotes HIV latent infection of resting CD4 T cells. Taken together, our results suggest that HIV hijacks LIMK to control the cortical actin dynamics for the initiation of viral infection of CD4 T cells.

In this article, we demonstrate that the initial actin polymerization is triggered by HIV-1 gp120-mediated transient activation of the LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1), 3The abbreviations used are: LIMK, LIM domain kinase; LIM1, LIM domain kinase 1; R5, CCR5-utilizing; OA, okadaic acid; PIC, preintegration complex; NTC, non-targeting control; SDF-1, stromal cell-derived factor-1. a kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin. We also report that LIMK1-mediated actin polymerization directly regulates CXCR4 receptor internalization that may facilitate early CD4-CXCR4 receptor clustering and viral entry. In addition, LIMK1-mediated actin polymerization is also critical for postentry viral DNA synthesis. These results demonstrated an important role of LIMK1 and early actin polymerization in the initiation of HIV-1 infection of CD4 T cells. Resting CD4 T cells were purified from peripheral blood by two rounds of negative selection as described previously (21Wu Y. Marsh J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the first round depletion, we used monoclonal antibodies against human CD14, CD56, HLA-DR, HLA-DP, and HLA-DQ (BD Biosciences). For the second-round depletion, we used monoclonal antibodies against human CD8, CD11b, and CD19 (BD Biosciences). Antibody-bound cells were depleted by using Dynabeads Pan Mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Cells were rested overnight before infection or treatment. In some occasions, CD4 T cells were prestimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads (2 beads per cell) for 1 day or cultured in IL-7 (Pepro Tech) (10 ng/ml) for 4 days before HIV infection. Blood monocyte-derived macrophages were prepared as described previously (22Kelly J. Beddall M.H. Yu D. Iyer S.R. Marsh J.W. Wu Y. Virology. 2008; 372: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Virus stocks of HIV-1NL4–3, NL(AD8), and YU2 were prepared by transfection of HeLa cells with cloned proviral DNA as described (21Wu Y. Marsh J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Single-cycle replicating viruses, HIV-1(VSV-G) and HIV-1(Env), were prepared as described previously (23Yu D. Wang W. Yoder A. Spear M. Wu Y. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000633Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Levels of p24 in viral supernatant were measured using the PerkinElmer Alliance p24 antigen ELISA kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Viral titer (TCID50) was determined on the Rev-dependent GFP indicator cell, Rev-CEM (24Wu Y. Beddall M.H. Marsh J.W. Retrovirology. 2007; 4: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Wu Y. Beddall M.H. Marsh J.W. Curr. HIV Res. 2007; 5: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For infection of resting CD4 T cells, unless specified, for most replication assays, 103.5 to 104.5 TCID50 units of HIV-1 were used to infect 106 cells. A half million cells were incubated with 1 μg of FITC-labeled anti-CXCR4 antibody (R&D Systems) in 0.5 ml of PBS + 0.1% BSA at 37 °C for 20 to 90 min, washed with cold PBS + 0.1% BSA and then resuspended in cold PBS + 0.1% BSA for flow cytometry analysis. To measure antibody-induced receptor internalization, 1 million cells were incubated with 1 μg of biotin-labeled anti-CXCR4 antibody (R&D Systems) at 4 °C for 2 h, washed with cold PBS + 0.1% BSA, and then incubated at 37 °C for 5 to 60 min. Cells were washed with acidic medium (PRMI 1640 (pH 4.0)) for 3 min twice, followed by washing with cold PBS + 0.1% BSA, and subsequently lysed in 100 μl SDS lysis buffer for Western blotting to detect intracellular CXCR4 with peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (KPL). A half million cells were resuspended into 100 μl RPMI 1640 medium and then added to the upper chamber of a 24-well transwell plate (Corning). The lower chamber was filled with 600 μl of medium premixed with SDF-1. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and then the upper chamber was removed and cells in the lower chamber were counted. Viral entry assays were performed as described previously (26Cavrois M. De Noronha C. Greene W.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We also used a Nef-luciferase-based entry assay. Viruses containing Nef-luciferase were produced as described previously (27Saeed M.F. Kolokoltsov A.A. Davey R.A. J. Virol. Methods. 2006; 135: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For entry assays, cells (1 × 106) were infected with 200 ng of Nef-luciferase containing viruses at 37 °C for 2 h, and then washed three times with medium. Cells were resuspended in 0.1 ml of luciferase assay buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured in live cells using a GloMax-Multi detection system (Promega). F-actin staining using FITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) was carried out as described previously (9Yoder A. Yu D. Dong L. Iyer S.R. Xu X. Kelly J. Liu J. Wang W. Vorster P.J. Agulto L. Stephany D.A. Cooper J.N. Marsh J.W. Wu Y. Cell. 2008; 134: 782-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Viral DNA and 2-LTR circles in shRNA lentiviral vector transduced cells were carried out as described previously (9Yoder A. Yu D. Dong L. Iyer S.R. Xu X. Kelly J. Liu J. Wang W. Vorster P.J. Agulto L. Stephany D.A. Cooper J.N. Marsh J.W. Wu Y. Cell. 2008; 134: 782-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) using the following primers and probes: HIV-Env-5F, HIV-Env-3R, and Env-Probe for HIV-1 DNA; and MH536, MH535, and MH603 for viral 2-LTR circles. Blots were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for either phospho-LIMK1/2, phospho-PAK1/2, phospho-PAK1, phospho-PAK2, or Phospho-PAK4 (1:1000 dilution) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) for 1 h or overnight at 4 °C. The blots were washed and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (KPL) (1:5000) for 1 h and then developed with SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce). The same blots were also stripped and reprobed with antibodies against LIMK1, PAK1, PAK2, PAK4 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), or GAPDH (Abcam). On some occasions, Western blotting was also performed using infrared imaging (Odyssey infrared imager, Li-cor Biosciences) with IRDye goat anti-rabbit 680 or 800cw antibodies (Li-cor Biosciences). GST pull-down assays for active RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce). Briefly, cells were lysed in lysis/binding/wash buffer, and then the supernatants were transferred to a glutathione column with either GST-human Pak1-pzi-binding domain (for Rac1 and Cdc42) or GST-human Rhotekin (for RhoA) attached. As a positive control, a portion of the cell lysate was incubated with GTPγS. As a negative control, a portion of the cell lysate was also incubated with GDP. The columns were washed, eluted with SDS sample buffer, and then immunoblotted with either anti-Rac1, anti-Cdc42, or anti-RhoA mouse monoclonal antibodies (Pierce). Plasmids (pLKO.1-puro) carrying LIMK1 shRNAs and a non-targeting shRNA (NTC) were purchased from Sigma. Viral particles were assembled as suggested by the manufacturer and used to transduce primary human CD4 T cells that had been prestimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads (2 beads per cell) for 12 h. After 12–24 h, the beads were removed and cells were selected and grown in fresh medium containing 1 μg/ml puromycin. CEM-SS cells were directly transduced with the shRNA lentiviral particles and selected and grown in puromycin-containing medium to maintain the knockdown phenotype. Additional experimental procedures can be found under supplemental experimental procedures. Binding of HIV-1 to resting T cells triggers a rapid, transient actin polymerization, a process resembling the SDF-1-mediated chemotactic response (Fig. 1, A–D and supplemental Fig. 1A). In SDF-1-treated human Jurkat and peripheral blood T cells, this rapid actin polymerization is associated with a concomitant, transient LIMK1 activation within 1 min (20Nishita M. Aizawa H. Mizuno K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 774-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). LIMK1 is the kinase responsible for the serine 3 phosphorylation of cofilin (28Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 29Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar), an actin-binding protein directly depolymerizing and severing actin filaments (30Bamburg J.R. Harris H.E. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1980; 121: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 31Lappalainen P. Drubin D.G. Nature. 1997; 388: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Overexpression of LIMK1 has been shown to promote accumulation of F-actin, whereas expression of a dominant negative form of LIMK1 resulted in a loss of F-actin (28Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 29Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar), suggesting that LIMK1 is a direct modulator of actin polymerization. To investigate whether HIV-1 infection of human resting CD4 T cells resulted in a similar LIMK activation, we chose to monitor the phosphorylation of LIMK. Blood resting CD4 T cells were purified by two rounds of negative depletion, rested overnight, and then infected with HIV-1 and immunoblotted for phospho-LIMK with an antibody specific for phosphorylation of LIMK1 at Thr-508 and LIMK2 at Thr-505. These two isoforms of LIMKs are genetic duplicates and are structurally and functionally similar, with LIMK1 expressed mostly in neurons and cells of the hematopoietic lineage (32Bernard O. Burkitt V. Webb G.C. Bottema C.D. Nicholl J. Sutherland G.R. Matthew P. Genomics. 1996; 35: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 33Ikebe C. Ohashi K. Fujimori T. Bernard O. Noda T. Robertson E.J. Mizuno K. Genomics. 1997; 46: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We found that LIMK was transiently activated (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. 1B) and that gp120 alone was sufficient to trigger this activation (Fig. 1F). Given that productive viral replication occurs in active T cells and in cells exposed to cytokines (34Unutmaz D. KewalRamani V.N. Marmon S. Littman D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1735-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), we examined LIMK activation in these cells following HIV infection. Blood CD4 T cells were either preactivated with CD3/CD28 stimulation or cultured in IL-7 for 4 days. Both treatments did not increase LIMK phosphorylation (Fig. 1G). However, when infected with HIV, these cells demonstrated a quick LIMK activation (1–3 min), followed by LIMK dephosphorylation and then reactivation at later times (Fig. 1, H and I). Similar LIMK activation was also observed in the infection of human primary macrophages with the CCR5-utilizing (R5) HIV-1, NL(AD8), and YU2 (Fig. 1, J and K). These results suggest that activation of LIMK is rather a general mechanism occurring early in HIV infection of both primary resting/active CD4 T cells and macrophages. We also examined whether LIMK activation is mediated through CXCR4 and the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gαi signaling because cofilin has been shown to be activated through CXCR4 and Gαi (9Yoder A. Yu D. Dong L. Iyer S.R. Xu X. Kelly J. Liu J. Wang W. Vorster P.J. Agulto L. Stephany D.A. Cooper J.N. Marsh J.W. Wu Y. Cell. 2008; 134: 782-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although pertussis toxin completely shut down late LIMK activation (at 20–30 min), it did not inhibit the early activation of LIMK (at 1–3 min) (Fig. 1, L and M), suggesting that the signals may be transduced from Gαi as well as other Gα subunits such as Gαq (18Wu Y. Yoder A. PLoS. Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000520Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Alternatively, HIV may use both CD4 and CXCR4 to activate LIMK. It has been shown that HIV-mediated CD4 signaling can lead to the phosphorylation of cofilin (7Jimenez-Baranda S. Gomez-Mouton C. Rojas A. Martinez-Prats L. Mira E. Ana Lacalle R. Valencia A. Dimitrov D.S. Viola A. Delgado R. Martinez A.C. Manes S. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2007; 9: 838-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), suggesting possible involvement of CD4 in LIMK activation. Because a majority of resting CD4 T cells express high levels of CD4 and CXCR4 but undetectable levels of CCR5, we treated resting CD4 T cells with the R5 virus, NL(AD8), and YU2 to determine LIMK activation in the presence of CD4 and absence of CCR5. As shown in Fig. 1, N and O, we observed modulation of LIMK activities by both NL(AD8) and YU2, demonstrating that in addition to CXCR4, CD4 may also be used by the virus to trigger LIMK activation. This receptor redundancy in triggering LIMK activity suggest that LIMK activation is likely a conserved pathway critical for the initiation of viral infection. The Rho family of GTPases such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 are well known regulators of actin dynamics, and LIMK is normally activated through phosphorylation by ROCK and PAK, which are downstream effectors of Rho and Rac/Cdc42, respectively. We next examined the PAK family proteins because both PAK1 and PAK4 have been shown to phosphorylate and regulate the activity of LIMK (35Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 36Dan C. Kelly A. Bernard O. Minden A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32115-32121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Resting CD4 T cells were treated with HIV-1 and immunoblotted with an antibody to the phosphorylated forms of both PAK1 and PAK2 at Thr-423 and Thr-402, respectively. We detected phosphorylation of both PAK1 and PAK2 following HIV-1 treatment of resting T cells (Fig. 2A). PAK2 activation is less studied and is not known to be directly involved in LIMK phosphorylation. Thus, we repeated the Western blotting using a second antibody to detect PAK2 phosphorylation at a separate site, serine 20, and confirmed that PAK2 was indeed phosphorylated in response to HIV-1 infection (Fig. 2B) or gp120 treatment (data not shown). Because both PAK1 and PAK2 share a number of substrates and can be activated by the small GTPase Rac and Cdc42, we could not exclude the possibility that PAK2 may also contribute to the phosphorylation of LIMK in HIV-1-infected resting CD4 T cells (37Misra U.K. Deedwania R. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26278-26286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Active PAK4 also interacts specifically with LIMK1 and stimulates LIMK1 activation (36Dan C. Kelly A. Bernard O. Minden A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32115-32121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), but we did not detect PAK4 phosphorylation in resting CD4 T cells at any time point following HIV infection (Fig. 2C). We further examined upstream of LIMK and PAK activation by investigating whether HIV-1 infection leads to the Rho family GTPase activation. When Rac1 and Cdc42 are in their activated GTP-bound state, they can bind to PAK1, disrupting an intramolecular interaction between the regulatory and catalytic domains of PAK1 and leading to PAK1 activation. Resting CD4 T cells were infected with HIV-1 for a time course. Cell lysates were harvested and used to pull down active Rho GTPases through a GST-PAK1 column. The samples were then eluted and immunoblotted for active Rac1 or Cdc42. As shown in Fig. 2D, we observed HIV-1-induced transient Rac-1 activation that begins at 1 min, peaks at 10 min, and then returns to the level found in uninfected resting CD4 T cells. Interestingly, HIV-1 infection of resting CD4 T cells resulted in no detectable activation of Cdc42 (Fig. 2E). We also examined the activation of RhoA using GST-human Rhotekin to pull down active RhoA but detected no RhoA activation in resting T cells (Fig. 2F). Taken together, our data indicate that the Rac-PAK-LIMK pathway is briefly activated by HIV-1 at an early time in the infection of resting CD4 T cells. Our results are consistent with previous findings that Rac1, but not Cdc42 nor Rho, mediates SDF-1-induced LIMK1 activation in human T cells (20Nishita M. Aizawa H. Mizuno K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 774-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Rac1 is also required for HIV envelope-mediated syncytium formation, indicating that Rac1 may be activated by gp120 to trigger actin polymerization to mediate cell-cell (13Pontow S.E. Heyden N.V. Wei S. Ratner L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7138-7147Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and virus-cell fusion (8Harmon B. Ratner L. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 9191-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To confirm the role of LIMK in HIV-1 infection of CD4 T cells, we sought to use pharmacological agents to modulate LIMK activity. Currently, there is no specific LIMK inhibitor or activator identified. During a drug screening, we discovered that okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A, triggered dramatic LIMK activation in resting CD4 T cells (Fig. 3A). This result suggested that LIMK is possibly dephosphorylated by PP1 or PP2A phosphatases, whereas a protein phosphatase 3 (formerly PP2B) inhibitor, FK-506, did not result in LIMK activation (data not shown). This OA-mediated LIMK activation is concomitant with a drastic polyme"
https://openalex.org/W1975735776,"Breast cancer is a major cause of cancer-related deaths in American women; therefore, the identification of novel breast cancer-related molecules for the discovery of new markers and drug targets remains essential. The human DEK gene, which encodes a chromatin-binding protein and DNA topology regulator, is upregulated in many types of cancer. DEK has been implicated as an oncogene in breast cancer based on mRNA expression studies, but its functional significance in breast cancer growth and progression has not yet been tested directly. We demonstrate that DEK is highly expressed in breast cancer cells compared with normal tissue, and functionally important for cellular growth, invasion and mammosphere formation. DEK overexpression in non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells resulted in increased growth and motility, with a concomitant downregulation of E-cadherin. Conversely, DEK knockdown in MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells resulted in decreased growth and motility with upregulation of E-cadherin. The use of DEK-proficient and -deficient breast cancer cells in orthotopic xenografts provided further in vivo evidence that DEK contributes to tumor growth. Activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway is important for normal and cancer stem cell character, growth and metastasis. We show that DEK expression stimulated, and DEK knockdown repressed β-catenin nuclear translocation and activity. Importantly, the expression of constitutively active β-catenin rescued breast cancer invasion defects of DEK knockdown cells. Together, our data indicate that DEK expression stimulates the growth, stem cell character and motility of breast cancer cells, and that DEK-dependent cellular invasion occurs at least in part via β-catenin activation."

We have previously shown that HPV-18 DNA amplification initiates in spinous cells in organotypic cultures of primary human keratinocytes during prolonged G2 phase, as signified by abundant cytoplasmic cyclin B1 (Wang, H.

In this study, we demonstrated that the E7 protein, which induces S phase reentry in suprabasal cells by destabilizing the p130 pocket protein (Genovese, N. J., Banerjee, N. S., Broker, T.

Western blots and indirect immunofluorescence assays were used to probe for host proteins known to control G2/M progression. E7 expression induced cytoplasmic accumulation of cyclin B1 and cdc2 in the suprabasal cells. The elevated cdc2 had inactivating phosphorylation on Thr14 or Tyr15, and possibly both, due to an increase in the responsible Wee1 and Myt1 kinases. In cells that harbored cytoplasmic cyclin B1 or cdc2, there was also an accumulation of the phosphatase-inactive cdc25C phosphorylated on Ser216, unable to activate cdc2. Moreover, E7 expression induced elevated expression of phosphorylated ATM (Ser1981) and the downstream phosphorylated Chk1, Chk2, and JNKs, kinases known to inactivate cdc25C. Similar results were observed in primary human keratinocyte raft cultures in which the productive program of HPV-18 took place.

They infect epithelial tissues, causing benign hyperproliferative lesions. More than 120 HPV genotypes have been cloned from patient specimens. The mucosotropic HPVs are broadly grouped into high-risk (HR) or low-risk (LR) types (1de Villiers E.M. Fauquet C. Broker T.R. Bernard H.U. zur Hausen H. Virology. 2004; 324: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). Persistent infections of the cervix, penis, anus, and the oropharyngeal epithelium by HR HPV-16, HPV-18, and related types can at a low frequency progress into high grade dysplasias and cancers. Infections by LR HPV types 6 and 11 cause 90% of benign genital warts and all the laryngeal papillomas, and these infections rarely progress to cancers. For both HR and LR HPVs, infection initiates in basal epithelial keratinocytes through wounding and is established during healing, whereas the viral productive program is tightly linked to squamous differentiation (for a review, see Ref. 2Chow L.T. Broker T.R. Steinberg B.M. APMIS. 2010; 118: 422-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Because the differentiated spinous cells would normally have withdrawn from the cell cycle and viral DNA replication is dependent on the host DNA replication machinery, the roles of the viral E6 and E7 oncoproteins are to reestablish a milieu in the differentiated keratinocytes supportive for viral DNA amplification. Briefly, E7 proteins of HR and LR HPV types promote S phase reentry in the differentiated strata (3Cheng S. Schmidt-Grimminger D.C. Murant T. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2335-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 4Banerjee N.S. Genovese N.J. Noya F. Chien W.M. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 6517-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). They do so by destabilizing p130, a pRB related pocket protein, which prevents S phase reentry by the differentiated cells (5Zhang B. Chen W. Roman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 6Genovese N.J. Banerjee N.S. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4862-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).

The viral life cycle has recently been recapitulated with high efficiency in organotypic (raft) cultures of primary human keratinocytes (PHKs) grown at the liquid medium-air interface. In these PHKs, HPV-18 genomic plasmids were efficiently generated in vivo by Cre-loxP-mediated excision recombination from a transfer vector (7Wang H.K. Duffy A.A. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As in patient specimens, the double-stranded HPV genomic plasmid is maintained at low copy numbers in the basal keratinocytes, and extensive amplification occurs in the mid and upper spinous strata. Moreover, viral DNA initiates amplification in G2-arrested cells, following host DNA replication, as revealed by the accumulation of highly elevated cytoplasmic cyclin B1 protein (7Wang H.K. Duffy A.A. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As the viral DNA amplifies, the E7 activity progressively diminishes and eventually ceases in the upper strata; keratinocytes then exit the cell cycle, as evidenced by the gradual reappearance of p130 and disappearance of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a protein induced by E7. Being an E2F-responsive gene, cyclin B1 disappears when E7 activity ceases. These cells then transit to the late phase of infection and express the capsid proteins for progeny virion morphogenesis. Here, we show that E7 alone is necessary and sufficient to induce prolonged G2 following S phase reentry in differentiated keratinocytes of raft cultures and have investigated the mechanisms that mediate this arrest. The retroviral constructs expressing wild type HPV-18 E7 (18E7) and E7 mutations (C27S, ΔDLLC, E35Q,E36Q,E37Q, and S32Q,S33Q) have been described (3Cheng S. Schmidt-Grimminger D.C. Murant T.

In these vectors, E7 is expressed from the HPV-18 enhancer-promoter located in the upstream regulatory region, whereas the neomycin resistance gene is driven by the SV40 promoter. The pNeo-loxP HPV-18 plasmid has been described (7Wang H.K. Duffy A.A. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The nls-Cre expression vector pCAGGS was a gift from Hardouin and Nagy (10Hardouin N. Nagy A. Genesis. 2000; 26: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PHKs were isolated from neonatal foreskin as described (11Wilson J.L. Dollard S.C. Chow L.T. Broker T.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 471-483PubMed Google Scholar). Early passage (P0/P1) cells were used for retroviral infection. Briefly, Bosc23 cells (ATCC, CRL-11270) and GP+envAm-12 (ATCC, CRL-9641) cells were used for ecotropic and amphotropic retrovirus production, respectively (12Banerjee N.S. Chow L.T. Broker T.R. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 119: 187-202PubMed Google Scholar). Amphotropic retroviruses were then used to infect PHKs and selected with 250 μg/ml of geneticin (Invitrogen) or 1.5 μg/ml of puromycin for 2 days. After a recovery for 2 more days, the bulk of the surviving cells were placed on a dermal equivalent comprised of rat tail type 1 collagen with embedded murine 3T3 J2 fibroblasts. Organotypic cultures were developed upon culturing the assembly at the liquid medium-air interface for 10 days (12Banerjee N.S. Chow L.T. Broker T.R. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 119: 187-202PubMed Google Scholar). For the 6–12 h immediately prior to harvest, BrdU was added to the medium at 50 μg/ml to label replicating host chromosomal DNA. Transfection of pNeo-loxP HPV-18 and pCAGGS (encoding nls-Cre) into early passages of PHKs has been described (7Wang H.K. Duffy A.A. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Transfected PHKs were selected with G418 (100 μg/ml) for 4 days. After a 1- or 2-day recovery, the cells were cultured as organotypic rafts for 10–14 days. BrdU was added to the medium at 50 μg/ml for 12 h immediately prior to harvest. Ten day old cultures were harvested for Western blots. Ten-, 12-, or 14-day-old cultures were used for in situ assays. BrdU was detected with mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU (1:100 dilution, catalog number NA20, Calbiochem, Merck) or sheep polyclonal biotinylated anti-BrdU (1:150, Ab 2284–125, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) antibodies. The antibodies against cdc2 (catalog number 9116B, mouse monoclonal), rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phospho-cdc2 Thr14 (catalog number 2543), phospho-cdc2 Thr161 (catalog number 9114), phospho-histone 3 Ser10 (catalog number 9701), Wee1 (catalog number 4936), Myt1 (catalog number 4282), phospho-Myt1 Ser83 (catalog number 4281), phospho-ATR Ser428 (catalog number 2853), Chk1 (catalog number 2345), phospho-Chk1 Ser345 (catalog number 2341), Chk2 (catalog number 2662), and phospho-Chk2 Thr68 (catalog number 2661) were all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rabbit monoclonal antibodies to phospho-cdc2 Tyr15 (catalog number 2543) and phospho-cdc25C Ser216 (catalog number 4901B) were also purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Rabbit monoclonal antibodies against cyclin B1 (catalog number 1495), ATM (catalog number 1549), and phospho-ATM Ser1981 (catalog number 2152) were obtained from Epitomics (Burlingame, CA). For Western blot analysis, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The anti-HPV-18 E7 goat polyclonal (catalog number sc-1590), anti-JNK (catalog number sc-7345), and HRP-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphorylated JNK was detected by Anti-ACTIVE JNK (Promega Corp., V7931). For simplicity, “phospho” is indicated by “p” in the article. Epithelial raft cultures were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, paraffin-embedded, and cut into 4-μm thin sections. After graded hydration, the tissue sections were subjected to antigen retrieval by heating at 98 °C for 10–15 min in 10 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.0). They were probed with primary antibodies for multiplexed antigen detection using tyramide-conjugated fluorophores. The specimens were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide between each antibody probing to quench endogenous HRP and previous HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4 °C and then probed with a 1:200 dilution of HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (G21040, Invitrogen) or anti-rabbit IgG (G21234, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Bound secondary antibody was detected by treating with tyramide-FITC (NEL701A001KT), tyramide-Cy3 (NEL704A001KT), or tyramide-Cy5 (NEL705A001KT) as per the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Following protein antigen detection, DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect HPV-18 genomic plasmid DNA was performed as described (7Wang H.K. Duffy A.A. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 13Van Tine B.A. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 292: 215-230PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue sections were heated to denature the DNA, treated with RNase A (100 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C, and then incubated overnight at 37 °C with biotinylated, nick-translated HPV-18 DNA probes. Following several washings in SSC, hybridized probes were detected by tyramide-FITC or tyramide-Cy3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Slides were mounted with DAPI-containing mounting medium (H1200, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were captured with an Olympus AX70 microscope using Axiovision image capture software and processed with Adobe Photoshop CS2. Lysates of raft tissues were prepared as described (5Zhang B. Chen W. Roman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) with minor changes, using mammalian cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 2 mm DTT, 1 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma catalog number P8340), freshly added 1 mm PMSF, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (PhosStop, Roche Applied Science). Lysates were briefly sonicated before clearing debris by high speed centrifugation at 4 °C. Total protein of 300 μg from each lysate was resolved using 12% SDS-PAGE, blotted on nitrocellulose membranes, and probed overnight with primary antibodies at 4 °C. Bound antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, GE Healthcare) after probing with HRP-labeled secondary antibody. Lysates of subconfluent submerged cultures of asynchronized HeLa cells and subconfluent HeLa cells treated with hydroxyurea (50 nm, 24 h) or nocodazole (50 microgram/ml) were used as references for the detection of HPV-18 E7 or various host proteins. PHKs were retrovirally transduced with the empty vector-only virus, the HR HPV-18 E7 (18E7), or mutations therein, each under control of the HPV-18 enhancer-promoter contained in the upstream regulatory region. The transduced cells were developed into organotypic raft cultures. Bromodeoxyuracil (BrdU) incorporation over the final 6–12 h before harvesting marked cells recently in S phase. Thin sections of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded raft cultures were simultaneously probed for cyclin B1 and BrdU by using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1A, upper panels). High cytoplasmic cyclin B1 signals were observed in about 50% of the BrdU-positive cells in the differentiated strata of the E7 cultures (Fig. 1A, middle panel). Cells that were BrdU-positive but cyclin B1-negative might not have progressed to late S phase when cyclin B1 is known to be synthesized (14Pines J. Hunter T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Cells positive for cyclin B1 but negative for BrdU could be those that had long exit the S phase. In addition, there was a population of differentiated cells that were negative for both, representing those that did not reenter S phase; this failure has been attributable to the inactivation of cyclin E/cdk2 by p27kip1 or p21cip1 (see Ref. 15Noya F. Chien W.M. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6121-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar and references therein). We also tested raft cultures transduced with E7E35Q,E36Q,E37Q. Unable to bind and phosphorylated by CKII, this mutant form of 18E7 does not destabilize p130 to a sufficient extent to enable S phase reentry (6Genovese N.J. Banerjee N.S. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4862-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 9Chien W.M. Parker J.N. Schmidt-Grimminger D.C. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 425-435PubMed Google Scholar). In these cultures, BrdU and cyclin B1 signals were restricted to the basal cells (Fig. 1A, right panel), as in normal PHK raft cultures (Fig. 1A, left panel). This phenotype was also observed in PHK raft cultures transduced with an empty retrovirus or E7 with a mutation or a deletion in the pocket protein binding motif (C27S, ΔDLLC) (data not shown, but see Figs. 1B and 4D). Thus, the ability of 18E7 to induce high levels of cytoplasmic cyclin B1 in suprabasal cells is dependent on its ability to induce S phase reentry. Because the suprabasal cyclin B1 signals in the 18E7 raft cultures were significantly elevated relative to those in the cycling basal cells, we suggest that the differentiated cells had a protracted G2 phase. In the experiments described below, we examined the mechanisms responsible for this phenotype using raft cultures of PHKs transduced with 18E7 or in productive PHK raft cultures harboring HPV-18 genomic plasmids. We will call these cultures collectively “HPV raft cultures,” whereas raft cultures of PHKs transduced with empty retrovirus or untransduced PHKs as “control raft cultures.” Typically, cyclin B1 is retained in the cytoplasm during S/G2. G2/M transition requires the activation and nuclear import of the cyclin B1-cdc2 complex. To investigate the cause for the 18E7-induced prolonged G2, we probed raft culture sections for synthesis and localization patterns of cdc2 relative to cyclin B1 by indirect immunofluorescence. In raft cultures expressing E7ΔDLLC (Fig. 1B, top row), a weak cdc2 signal co-localized with a weak cyclin B1 in some basal cells. The signals were detected either in the nucleus or cytoplasm, as expected of cycling cells. No signals were detected in suprabasal cells. Similar expression patterns for cyclin B1 and cdc2 were detected in control raft cultures (data not shown). In contrast, the wild type HPV-18 E7 induced not only cytoplasmic cyclin B1 in spinous cells, it also induced cytoplasmic cdc2 (Fig. 1B, middle row). About 50–60% cdc2-positive suprabasal cells were also positive for cyclin B1, whereas all cyclin B1-positive cells were positive for cytoplasmic cdc2. Only about 10% of cyclin B1-positive cells had the signal detected in the nucleus, whereas only 2.4% had both cyclin B1 and cdc2 in the nucleus. Because S phase reentry is necessary for suprabasal cyclin B1 and cdc2 accumulation (Fig. 1, A, right panel, and B, top row), cells positive for cyclin B1 or cdc2 were recently in S phase. Simultaneous probing for BrdU and cdc2 showed that this was indeed the case (data not shown). Raft cultures of HPV-18 genomic plasmid-containing PHKs, in which a productive program was taking place, were also positive for cytoplasmic cdc2, in addition to cyclin B1 in a subset of differentiated strata (Fig. 1B, lower row). As with E7 raft cultures, all cyclin B1-positive cells were also positive for cytoplasmic cdc2, while about 80% of cdc2-positive cells had colocalizing cyclin B1. Only 1% cyclin B1-positive cells exhibited a nuclear or pan-cellular signal, but none showed nuclear colocalization of cyclin B1 and cdc2. As with cyclin B1, in either HPV raft culture, the levels of cdc2, when detected, were much higher than those in the basal cycling cells, suggesting a prolonged G2 phase during which both cyclin B1 and cdc2 accumulated in the cytoplasm. In addition to the requirement for cyclin B1, the activity of cdc2 is controlled by kinases and phosphatases (16Taylor W.R. DePrimo S.E. Agarwal A. Agarwal M.L. Schönthal A.H. Katula K.S. Stark G.R.

Cdc2 has many potential phosphorylation sites, among which three have been characterized in detail. Kinase-active cdc2 is phosphorylated on Thr161 but not on Thr14 and Tyr15. During interphase, cdc2 is phosphorylated by CAK/cdk7 on Thr161 but is rendered inactive by Myt1- and Wee1-mediated phosphorylation on Thr14, Tyr15, or both. To promote G2-M transition, the kinase function of cdc2 is activated by protein phosphatases cdc25B and –C, which removes inhibitory phosphorylations. The multiple cdc2 isoforms can be detected by phospho-specific antibodies (Refs. 19Atherton-Fessler S. Liu F. Gabrielli B. Lee M.S. Peng C.Y. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 989-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Liu F. Stanton J.J. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5113-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and references therein). To assess whether cdc2 might be inactivated by hyperphosphorylation, we examined cdc2 in raft culture lysates by immunoblotting with antibodies to the total cdc2 and those specific for various phosphorylated cdc2 (p-cdc2). HeLa cells are cervical carcinoma cells that actively express HPV-18 E6 and E7 genes. As references, we used lysates from asynchronous HeLa cultures and HeLa cells enriched in the G1/S phase with hydroxyurea or in M phase after treatment with nocodazole. FACS analysis verified the effects of the treatments (Fig. 2A). Using Western blots, we first confirmed expression of the HPV-18 E7 protein in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B) and HPV raft cultures. E7 was detected in all except the control raft cultures. The presence of E7 correlated with elevated cyclin B1 and cdc2 relative to the control lysates (Fig. 2, B and D). Because of the many additional potential phosphorylation sites and the close migration rates of the bands, we are not able to determine with absolute certainty how the cdc2 protein in each band was phosphorylated. We shall call the fastest band reactive with phospho-specific cdc2 antibodies hypophosphorylated, being phosphorylated on at least one of the three well characterized substrates, whereas the slower bands represented hyperphosphorylation on at least two or perhaps all three known substrates. The lysates of the two HPV raft cultures gave virtually identical results with regard to the various p-cdc2 isoforms (Fig. 2, B–D). Relative to the two control raft cultures, the steady state levels of hyperphosphorylated and hypophosphorylated cdc2 isoforms were elevated. The p-cdc2 Thr14-reactive isoforms were, however, distinct in that there was a higher relative abundance in the fastest moving hypophosphorylated isoform, relative to all other lysates (Fig. 2B). Antibodies to p-cdc2 Thr161 detected two weak bands in the HPV raft cultures (Fig. 2B). The isoforms reactive with the p-cdc2 Tyr15 antibody were similar to asynchronous HeLa cells and hydroxyurea-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 2C). Importantly, none of the p-cdc2 isoforms detected in the HPV raft cultures resembled those present in nocodazole-treated HeLa cells that exhibited weak p-cdc2 Thr14 and p-cdc2 Tyr15 bands but a strong unique p-cdc2 Thr161 band (Fig. 2, B and C). These patterns of cdc2 phosphorylation in nocodazole-treated HeLa cells agree with the report that, during mitosis, p-cdc2 Thr161 predominates (19Atherton-Fessler S. Liu F. Gabrielli B. Lee M.S. Peng C.Y. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 989-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These results indicate that a significant fraction of cdc2 up-regulated by E7 is hyperphosphorylated on Thr14, Tyr15, and Thr161. Even the hypophosphorylated isoform bore inhibitory phosphorylation on Thr14 (Fig. 2B). Inhibitory phosphorylation of cdc2 on Tyr15 is carried out by Wee1 in the nucleus (22Parker L.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1992; 257: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed elevated Wee1 expression in the 18E7 raft cultures relative to all three HeLa cell extracts, whereas the control raft cultures had no signal. The HPV-18 genome-containing raft cultures had a signal comparable with the asynchronous HeLa cells (Fig. 2E). Myt1 is a dual specificity cytoplasmic membrane-associated kinase that phosphorylates cdc2 on Thr14 and Tyr15 residues, with a greater preference for Thr14 (20Liu F. Stanton J.J. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 21Liu F. Rothblum-Oviatt C. Ryan C.E. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell.

The Myt1 level was elevated in both HPV raft cultures relative to the PHK control raft culture (Fig. 2F, upper panel). As expected, the Myt1 level was very low in nocodazole-treated HeLa. During mitosis, Myt1 activity is inhibited when it is hyperphosphorylated by several kinases, such as cdc2, AKT, p90 RSK, and Plk1 (25Booher R.N. Holman P.S. Fattaey A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22300-22306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 26Palmer A. Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25277-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Immunoprobing with p-Myt1 Ser83-specific antibody detected a strong slower migrating band in nocodazole-treated HeLa cells. This band intensity was very low in the control and E7 raft cultures but undetectable in the HPV-18 raft cultures (Fig. 2F, middle panel). This inability to detect high p-Myt1 Ser83 in HPV raft cultures is in agreement with the absence or near absence of histone 3 phosphorylated on Ser10 (p-H3 Ser10), a marker of mitotic cells, in the HPV raft cultures (Fig. 2D). Collectively, the elevated active Wee1 or Myt1 in HPV raft cultures could then cause inhibitory phosphorylation on cdc2. During the G2 to M transition, cdc2 is dephosphorylated on Thr14 and Tyr15 by cdc25B in the cytoplasm and cdc25C in the nucleus, thereby activating the cdc2-cyclin B complex to trigger mitosis (28Coleman T.R.

The cdc25C phosphatase is inactivated by phosphorylation on Ser216 (p-cdc25C Ser216); binding to the 14-3-3 protein then results in its export from the nucleus and retention in the cytoplasm (33Dalal S.N.

Indirect double immunofluorescence analysis revealed an induction of cytoplasmic p-cdc25C Ser216 in a significant subset of differentiated cells in E7-expressing raft cultures and the signals often colocalized with cdc2 (Fig. 3A, top row) or BrdU (data not shown), indicating that the cells were currently or recently in S phase. In contrast, there was no signal in differentiated strata of raft cultures expressing HPV-18 E7 proteins, which have inactivating mutations in the pocket protein binding domain (ΔDLLC, C27S) or in CKII substrates (S32Q,S33Q). Only some basal cells have weak signals. As before (Fig. 1B), cdc2 was detected only in the basal layer of cycling cells in HPV-18 E7ΔDLLC raft cultures.

It catalyzes the final and committed step in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerol, which is the principal repository of fatty acids for energy utilization and membrane formation. Two distinct family members of acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase, known as DGAT1 and DGAT2, have been characterized in different organisms, including mammals, fungi, and plants. In this study, we characterized the functional role and topological orientation of signature motifs in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) DGAT2 using mutagenesis in conjunction with chemical modification. Our data provide evidence that both the N and C termini are oriented toward the cytosol and have different catalytic roles. A highly conserved motif, 129YFP131, and a hydrophilic segment exclusive to yeast DGAT2 reside in a long endoplasmic reticulum luminal loop following the first transmembrane domain and play an essential role in enzyme catalysis. In addition, the strongly conserved His195 within the motif HPHG, which may play a role in the active site of DGAT2, is likely embedded in the membrane. These results indicate some similarities to the topology model of murine DGAT2 but also reveal striking differences suggesting that the topological organization of DGAT2 is not ubiquitously conserved.

Down-regulation of DGAT2 expression in mice resulted in increased resistance to obesity as well as significant improvement in hepatic steatosis and insulin sensitivity (6Yu X.X. Murray S.F.

Seishima M. Kawasaki S. Okubo K. Mitsui H. Torii H. Imai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, DGAT2 represents an important therapeutic target for management or treatment of these disorders. In certain plant species, DGAT2 plays a role in the selective accumulation of unusual fatty acids into TG (10Shockey J.M. Gidda S.K. Chapital D.C. Kuan J.C. Dhanoa P.K. Bland J.M. Rothstein S.J.

Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 2541-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Overexpression of these DGAT2s in crop plants represents a potential means of producing novel value-added oils to meet the growing demand from industry (12Snyder C.L. Yurchenko O.P. Siloto R.M. Chen X. Liu Q. Mietkiewska E. Weselake R.J. New Biotechnol. 2009; 26: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In fungi such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DGAT2 (also known as Dga1p) is the only characterized DGAT and contributes to most of the TG synthesis (13Sandager L. Gustavsson M.H. Ståhl U. Dahlqvist A. Wiberg E. Banas A. Lenman M. Ronne H. Stymne S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6478-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Yet a detailed molecular understanding of DGAT2 function is lacking due to the intrinsic technical difficulties associated with purification and crystallization of this membrane protein (14Little D. Weselake R. Pomeroy K. Furukawa-Stoffer T. Bagu J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To date, no three-dimensional structural data have been reported for DGAT-related proteins. Recently, there have been few reports providing insights into the molecular aspects of DGAT2-related enzymes. Experimental data from murine DGAT2 have led to a topology model in which DGAT2 is proposed to possess one or two adjacent transmembrane domains (TMDs) at the N terminus, with both termini residing in the cytosol. In this model, the bulk of the protein at the C terminus faces toward the cytosolic side and likely contains the active site of the enzyme (15Stone S.J. Levin M.C. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40273-40282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Studies using tung tree DGAT2 expressed in tobacco cells also demonstrated that both the N and C termini were exposed to the cytosol (10Shockey J.M. Gidda S.K. Chapital D.C. Kuan J.C. Dhanoa P.K. Bland J.M. Rothstein S.J. Mullen R.T. Dyer J.M. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 2294-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Although the location of the putative TMDs was consistent with the predicted result, it remains unclear whether the N terminus of the protein consists of two TMDs or one long domain embedded in the membrane bilayer. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that two conserved regions are catalytically essential for murine DGAT2 (15Stone S.J. Levin M.C. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40273-40282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). One region in the first TMD is proposed to be a putative neutral lipid-binding domain, and the other region is the tetrapeptide HPHG, facing the cytosol. As an initial step toward functional and structural analysis of this enzyme, we previously used yeast DGAT2 (ScDGAT2) as a model to probe the role of cysteines in enzyme catalysis and structural support; we found that cysteines were not essential to either of these processes, but a widely conserved motif at the C terminus of yeast DGAT2 was identified that may include an active site or be involved in protein folding (16Liu Q. Siloto R.M. Weselake R.J. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In a continuing investigation to better understand the molecular mechanism of this enzyme, we have probed the functional and structural importance of signature motifs in ScDGAT2. Through in silico analyses, we uncovered unique sequence features and conserved motifs in ScDGAT2. Mutagenesis revealed that some of the studied motifs are functionally important for ScDGAT2 activity, including a previously undisclosed hydrophilic stretch found only in this enzyme. We then evaluated their topological orientation using chemical modification of single cysteines. Our work provides new experimental evidence that ScDGAT2 has a different topology compared with murine DGAT2. Zymolase 100T was obtained from Seikagaku Corp. (East Falmouth, MA). Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets was purchased from Roche Applied Science. [14C]Oleoyl-CoA was from GE Healthcare. Diolein was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). mPEG5000-maleimide (PEG-mal, 5 kDa) was obtained from SunBio (Orinda, CA). Anti-V5-HRP antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen. Rabbit anti-Kar2p antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Redwood City, CA). The goat anti-rabbit-HRP secondary antibodies were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. The coding region for the yeast S. cerevisiae DGAT2 was PCR-amplified and ligated into the yeast expression vector pYES2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and fused with a C-terminal V5 tag (referred to as ScDGAT-V5). N- and C-terminal truncation mutants N1(Δ1–62), N2 (Δ1–33), C1 (Δ374–418), C2 (Δ391–418), C3 (Δ413–418), C4 (Δ413–418, 413::A6), as well as N3, in which V5 tag was fused to N terminus instead, were similarly constructed. Other deletion, insertion, and point mutants, including TM (Δ70–91), DS1 (Δ150–187), DS2 (Δ156–174), DS3 (162::163–172), DS4 (162::GA5), H193A, H195A, EPHS (H193E/G196S), YFP (Y129A/F130A/P131A), F71A, and L73A, were constructed by PCR-driven overlapping extension according to the method of Heckman and Pease (17Heckman K.L. Pease L.R. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 924-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar) using ScDGAT2-V5 as a template. Plasmids coding for various single Cys-containing mutants were generated by the same method using a previously constructed Cys-less mutant (C0) of ScDGAT2-V5 as the template, in which all seven endogenous cysteines were mutated to alanines (16Liu Q. Siloto R.M. Weselake R.J. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A list of primers used for the construction of various mutants is given in supplemental Table S1. A schematic representation of each mutant is also shown in supplemental Fig. 1. All constructs were sequenced to verify their integrity and that the genes were cloned in-frame with the epitope tag. A yeast quadruple knock-out strain H1246 (MATα are1-Δ::HIS3, are2-Δ::LEU2, dga1-Δ::KanMX4, lro1-Δ::TRP1 ADE2), which is devoid of DGAT activity and TG biosynthesis, was used as the host strain for protein expression experiments (provided by Dr. S. Stymne and U. Ståhl) (13Sandager L. Gustavsson M.H. Ståhl U. Dahlqvist A. Wiberg E. Banas A. Lenman M. Ronne H. Stymne S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6478-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Constructs were transformed into the yeast cells using the lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/PEG method (18Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were also transformed with an empty vector or pYESLacZ as a control. The transformants were selected on plates lacking uracil and cultivated in yeast nitrogen base with 2% (w/v) dextrose (YNBD) medium. Cells were then harvested, washed with water, and inoculated in induction medium where dextrose was replaced by 2% (w/v) galactose and 1% (w/v) raffinose to induce the gene expression. Right side-out microsomes were prepared as described elsewhere with the following modifications (19Gilstring C.F. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31488-31495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells were collected, washed with water, and resuspended in spheroplasting buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol). Cells were then converted to spheroplasts by incubating at 30 °C for 15 min in the presence of 0.75 mg/ml zymolase 100T. The spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm sorbitol, 50 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture. Spheroplasts were lysed by 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Unlysed cells and cell debris were pelleted by another centrifugation at 1000 × g. The supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to recover the microsomes. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4. Equivalent amounts of microsomal protein as determined by BCA assay (Pierce) were used for in vitro DGAT activity assays that were performed using a previously described method (16Liu Q. Siloto R.M. Weselake R.J. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, DGAT activity was measured as the production of [14C]TG from [14C]oleoyl-CoA and unlabeled dioleoyl-DAG in a 10-min assay. TG was separated from the reaction mixture by TLC, and the radioactivity was quantified using a Beckman-Coulter LS6500 liquid scintillation counter. The Nile red fluorescence assay was performed as described previously (20Siloto R.M. Truksa M. Brownfield D. Good A.G. Weselake R.J. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2009; 47: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Siloto R.M. Truksa M. He X. McKeon T. Weselake R.J. Lipids. 2009; 44: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells expressing recombinant ScDGAT2 and ensuing mutants were cultivated in induction medium for 24 h. Ninety five microliters of cell suspension were placed in a 96-well dark flat-bottom plate (UNIPLATE, Whatman). The background fluorescence was measured with 485 and 538 nm emission and excitation filters, respectively, using a plate fluorimeter (Fluoroscan Accent, Thermo, Milford, MA). Five microliters of Nile Red solution (0.8 mg/ml) were added to the culture, and a second fluorescence measurement was conducted under the same conditions. The first measurement was subtracted from the second measurement, and the results were divided by A600 nm with appropriate dilutions. The assays were conducted with three individual cultures for each ScDGAT2 mutant and three technical replicates. Preparation of microsomes was performed as described above. An equal volume of 2% SDS (w/v) or 0.2 m Na2CO3, pH 11, was added to the suspended microsomal proteins. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to separate the supernatant and pellet fractions. The pellets were brought up to the same volume as the supernatant with resuspension buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4). Samples from supernatant and pellet were mixed with SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Thiol-specific chemical blocking with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) followed by modification with PEG-mal under nondenaturing and denaturing conditions was performed using modifications of the procedures described by Wang et al. (22Wang Y. Toei M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20696-20702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For modification under nondenaturing conditions, microsomal protein was diluted to 1 mg/ml and aliquoted equally for one of three treatments as follows: 1) 1 h of incubation on ice with 0.5 mm PEG-mal (to modify cysteines facing the cytoplasm), followed by addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) to 10 mm and further incubation for 10 min to quench the reaction; 2) 30 min of incubation with 5 mm NEM to block accessible sulfhydryl groups, followed by reacting with PEG-mal and quenching with DTT as above; 3) untreated control. For modification under denaturing conditions, diluted microsomal vesicles were divided into 2 aliquots. One was directly treated with 0.5 mm PEG-mal in the presence of 2% SDS followed by addition of DTT and incubation for 10 min as described above. The other half was first incubated with 5 mm NEM on ice for 30 min in the absence of SDS followed by immediate ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min). The pellet was washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold resuspension buffer to remove excess NEM. After another ultracentrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of resuspension buffer. The sample was then incubated with 0.5 mm PEG-mal in the presence of 2% SDS at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction was finally quenched by incubation with 10 mm DTT for 10 min. All aliquots were mixed with sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Protein samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. V5-tagged ScDGAT2 mutants were detected using anti-V5-HRP antibodies according to the protocol described by the manufacturer. Control protein chaperone Kar2p was detected using anti-Kar2p as the primary antibody followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit-HRP secondary antibody. The bound antibodies were detected using the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare). Densitometry analysis of immunoblots was performed using ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare).

Multiple sequence alignment is an essential tool for predicting important structural features of proteins. To identify DGAT2 conserved motifs in silico, 34 representative polypeptides from a wide range of organisms were aligned using Clustal W algorithm. Three regions with remarkable sequence conservation were located (Fig. 1). First, the motif YFP (129YFP131 in ScDGAT2) is completely conserved in DGAT2 from different organisms with the exception of castor bean, where it corresponds to HFP. Second, the motif HPHG (193HPHG196 in ScDGAT2) is conserved in sequences from animals and fungi and is essential for DGAT2 activity in mice (15Stone S.J. Levin M.C. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40273-40282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In plant DGAT2s, the corresponding motif is EPHS. The third motif consisting of RXGFX(K/R)XAXXXGXXX(L/V)VPXXXFG(E/Q) spans the longest conserved region in DGAT2-homologous proteins. This motif is found between residues 288 and 311 in ScDGAT2 and is in close proximity to Cys314, which has been previously demonstrated to be the locus of NEM-mediated enzyme inhibition (16Liu Q. Siloto R.M. Weselake R.J. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that a putative neutral lipid-binding domain, FLXLXXXn (where n is a nonpolar amino acid), earlier reported in murine DGAT2 (15Stone S.J. Levin M.C. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40273-40282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), could not be identified in ScDGAT2. Instead, the corresponding motif 71FVLF74 is found between positions 71 and 74. This domain was not identified in plant orthologues as well. The sequence alignment also showed a segment of 38 amino acids situated between YFP and HPHG motifs (positions 150–187 in ScDGAT2), which is unique to ScDGAT2 and absent in plant, animal, and other fungal DGAT2s. To further explore the potential structural aspects using in silico approaches, we evaluated the hydropathy profile and topology distribution of ScDGAT2 in comparison with murine and tung tree DGAT2s, whose topological orientations were experimentally tested (15Stone S.J. Levin M.C. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40273-40282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The distribution of sequence motifs in yeast, murine, and tung DGAT2 was compared in Kyte-Doolittle (30Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) hydropathy plots (Fig. 2, dashed boxes). Generally, these three proteins show similar plots. The N-terminal region of each protein contains a hydrophilic stretch followed by a hydrophobic region except that the hydrophilic tail in tung DGAT2 is shorter. ScDGAT2 and tung DGAT2, however, contain other segments that are more hydrophobic than murine DGAT2. In particular, ScDGAT2 has a contiguous sequence of mostly hydrophobic amino acids between residues 192 and 250 that contain the motif HPHG (Fig. 2A). A highly hydrophobic stretch, including the motif EPHS, was also observed in tung DGAT2 between positions 117 and 157 (Fig. 2C). In addition, the 38-residue segment found exclusively in ScDGAT2 (Fig. 2A) resides in a hydrophilic region and is positioned between the conserved motifs 129YFP131 and 193HPHG196. We then subjected three DGAT2 sequences to seven common topological prediction programs based on different algorithms (Table 1). Murine DGAT2 was predicted to have one or two abutting TMDs located at the N-terminal region and an N terminus facing the cytosol, which is in agreement with the experimentally determined topology. The N terminus of tung DGAT2 was also predicted to face the cytosolic side that is consistent with previous experimental evidence. However, six out of seven programs predicted that tung DGAT2 has at least three TMDs, which include two adjoining TMDs at N-terminal region and another TMD (between positions 112 and 139) in the hydrophobic region described above. In the case of ScDGAT2, the orientation of the N terminus was generally predicted to be toward the cytosol with three to four TMDs in the polypeptide. The first TMD (residues 66–97) was predicted by all algorithms and is comparable with the model of murine DGAT2. There was more variability, however, in the predictions for the location of putative TMDs in the region between residues 188 and 236. Two additional TMDs were predicted between amino acids 290–313 and 341–359. These predictions corroborate the hydropathy plot analysis suggesting that DGAT2s from other kingdoms may have a different topology compared with murine DGAT2, which could affect the orientation of signature motifs discussed above.TABLE 1Predicted TMDs in yeast, murine, and tung tree DGAT2sHMMTOPTMHMMTopPredSVMtmSOSUIConPred IITMpredScDGAT268–9270–9268–8866–9775–9773–9372–92193–207188–210189–209196–214200–224215–235217–231213–234215–235216–236294–310290–310293–313341–359No. of TMD4133343OrientationaOrientation was of the N terminus.

Open table in a new tab To determine the functional significance of these motifs in ScDGAT2, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis using recombinant in S. cerevisiae strain H1246. The impact of these mutations was evaluated by measuring the in vitro enzyme activity and protein expression level using isolated microsomes as well as through in vivo detection of TG produced by Nile Red assay of the yeast cultures. Because the strain H1246 is devoid of DGAT activity, results are a direct measurement of the performance of each mutant. The expression of wild-type (WT) ScDGAT2 and the ensuing mutants was verified using immunoblotting by taking advantage of the C-terminal V5 tag. As shown in Fig. 3A, substitution of 129YFP131 to 129AAA131 (mutant YFP) and His193 to Ala193 (mutant H193A) led to almost complete loss of enzyme activity. Similarly, substitution of His195 to Ala195 and replacement of 193HPHG196 to corresponding motif EPHS found in plant DGAT2s (mutants H195A and EPHS, respectively) both abolished the enzyme activities. Deletion of the first putative TMD between residues 70 and 91 also resulted in the total loss of activity (mutant TM). The Phe71 to Ala71 and Leu73 to Ala73 substitution in the sequence corresponding to the putative lipid-binding motif in murine DGAT2 (mutant F71A and L73A, respectively) retained significant activity (over 40%) compared with the WT ScDGAT2. These effects correlated with the quantity of TG produced by yeast cells determined by Nile Red fluorescence. Immunoblotting analysis of microsomes used for the enzyme assays revealed similar accumulation of each mutant protein in comparison to WT (Fig. 3A, insets), indicating that the observed changes in activity were not a result of differential expression levels. The fact that the hydrophilic stretch between motif 129YFP131 and 193HPHG196 (Fig. 2A) is unique for ScDGAT2 raised the question of whether this segment plays a role in enzyme function. To address this, we performed deletion and insertion mutagenesis on this segment. Deletion of the whole segment (mutant DS1, Δ150–187) resulted in an enzyme with less than 20% of WT activity (Fig. 3B), whereas removal of a smaller segment (mutant DS2, Δ156–174) preserved around 50% of the original activity. In view of these results, we hypothesized that insertions in this region might have a positive effect on enzyme activity. Thus, we duplicated a stretch of 10 amino acids from residues 163 to 172 at position 162 creating mutant DS3 (162::163–172). This mutant showed an 80% increase in enzyme activity compared with the WT. To investigate whether this effect was specific to the sequence duplicated, we inserted a decapeptide composed of (GA)5 in the same position.

Altered expression of human enhancer of filamentation 1 (HEF1; also known as NEDD9 or Cas-L) has been implicated in progression of melanoma, breast, and CRC. However, the regulation of HEF1 and the role of HEF1 in CRC tumorigenesis are not fully understood. We here identify HEF1 as a novel Wnt signaling target. The expression of HEF1 was upregulated by Wnt-3a, β-catenin, and Dvl2 in a dose-dependent manner, and was suppressed following β-catenin downregulation by shRNA. In addition, elevated HEF1 mRNA and protein levels were observed in CRC cell lines and primary tumor tissues, as well as in the colon and adenoma polyps of ApcMin/+ mice. Moreover, HEF1 levels in human colorectal tumor tissues increased with the tumor grade. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and promoter analyses revealed three functional T-cell factor (TCF)-binding sites in the promoter of HEF1 responsible for HEF1 induction by Wnt signaling. Ectopic expression of HEF1 increased cell proliferation and colony formation, while downregulation of HEF1 in SW480 cells by shRNA had the opposite effects and inhibited the xenograft tumor growth. Furthermore, overexpression of HEF1 in SW480 cells promoted cell migration and invasion. Together, our results determined a novel role of HEF1 as a mediator of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway for cell proliferation, migration, and tumorigenesis, as well as an important player in colorectal tumorigenesis and progression. HEF1 may represent an attractive candidate for drug targeting in CRC."

In diabetes, hyperglycemia leads to the loss of surface expression of nephrin and causes albuminuria. Here, we report a mechanism that can explain this phenomenon: hyperglycemia directly enhances the rate of nephrin endocytosis via regulation of the β-arrestin2-nephrin interaction by PKCα. We identified PKCα and protein interacting with c kinase-1 (PICK1) as nephrin-binding proteins. Hyperglycemia induced up-regulation of PKCα and led to the formation of a complex of nephrin, PKCα, PICK1, and β-arrestin2 in vitro and in vivo. Binding of β-arrestin2 to the nephrin intracellular domain depended on phosphorylation of nephrin threonine residues 1120 and 1125 by PKCα. Further, cellular knockdown of PKCα and/or PICK1 attenuated the nephrin–β-arrestin2 interaction and abrogated the amplifying effect of high blood glucose on nephrin endocytosis. In C57BL/6 mice, hyperglycemia over 24 h caused a significant increase in urinary albumin excretion, supporting the concept of the rapid impact of hyperglycemia on glomerular permselectivity.

IntroductionDiabetes mellitus is a major health problem in Western countries. Despite therapeutic advances, diabetic nephropathy remains the leading cause of end stage renal disease (1Rossing P. Curr. Diab. Rep. 2006; 6: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Chronic hyperglycemia causes glomerular damages such as endothelial dysfunction, loss of negative charges in the basement membrane, and podocyte damage (2Ziyadeh F.N. Wolf G. Curr. Diabetes Rev. 2008; 4: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Microalbuminuria is an early symptom of a “leaky” glomerular barrier and is associated with a markedly increased cardiovascular risk (3Kalaitzidis R. Bakris G. J. Clin. Hypertens. 2009; 11: 636-643Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Podocytes are visceral epithelial cells wrapped around glomerular capillaries and are connected by the slit diaphragm. This specialized cell junction is a dynamic multiprotein complex that functions as a size-selective sieve to prevent the loss of plasma proteins through urine (4Huber T.B. Benzing T. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2005; 14: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 5Tryggvason K. Patrakka J. Wartiovaara J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 354: 1387-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Nephrin serves as the backbone of this diaphragm by functioning as a regulator of podocyte signaling and mediator of actin dynamics (6Jones N. Blasutig I.M. Eremina V. Ruston J.M. Bladt F. Li H. Huang H. Larose L. Li S.S. Takano T. Quaggin S.E. Pawson T. Nature. 2006; 440: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 7Welsh G.I.

Nephrol. 2003; 14: 918-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Several podocyte signaling abnormalities have been noted in diabetes. For example, mice and humans with diabetes show altered distribution and expression of nephrin (9Kim J.J. Li J.J. Jung D.S. Kwak S.J. Ryu D.R. Yoo T.H. Han S.H. Choi H.Y. Kim H.J. Han D.S. Kang S.W.

Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and hyperglycemia increases diacylglycerol generation, causing PKC activation (2Ziyadeh F.N. Wolf G. Curr. Diabetes Rev. 2008; 4: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, it is not fully understood how “hyperglycemic” signaling in diabetes affects the expression and distribution of nephrin.Menne et al. (12Menne J. Meier M. Park J.K. Boehne M. Kirsch T. Lindschau C. Ociepka R. Leitges M. Rinta-Valkama J. Holthofer H. Haller H. Kidney Int. 2006; 70: 1456-1462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) reported a major step elucidating podocyte signaling in diabetes: they showed that albuminuria does not develop in diabetic PKCα-deficient mice and concluded that decreased nephrin expression in diabetes is a result of altered transcriptional regulation. All of the studies until now were conducted in chronic models of diabetes (13Meier M. Menne J. Haller H. Diabetologia. 2009; 52: 765-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, their conclusions were based on the changes occurring in long term hyperglycemia. However, considering the highly dynamic structure of the slit diaphragm, we hypothesized that elevated blood glucose levels have an immediate impact on the molecular composition of the slit diaphragm. Our hypothesis is supported by the recent study of Axelsson et al. (14Axelsson J. Rippe A. Rippe B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2010; 298: F1306-F1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that acute hyperglycemia impairs glomerular permselectivity in previously normoglycemic rats. Therefore, nephrin might be involved in the changes in glomerular permeability induced by high blood glucose levels.We have recently demonstrated that nephrin endocytosis occurs in a β-arrestin2-dependent manner (15Quack I. Rump L.C. Gerke P. Walther I. Vinke T. Vonend O. Grunwald T. Sellin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 14110-14115Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Regulation of highly dynamic protein complexes such as the slit diaphragm typically involves changes in their phosphorylation pattern (16Garg P. Verma R. Nihalani D. Johnstone D.B. Holzman L.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 8698-8712Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the kinase mediating the binding of β-arrestin2 to nephrin has not yet been identified. Studies have evidenced that β-arrestin2 binding is regulated by serine/threonine phosphorylation of its target proteins (17Xiang B. Yu G.H. Guo J. Chen L. Hu W. Pei G. Ma L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4709-4716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Lorenz S. Frenzel R. Paschke R. Breitwieser G.E. Miedlich S.U. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2398-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In our efforts to identify candidate kinases, sequence analysis of the nephrin C terminus revealed a PKC consensus site within the β-arrestin2 interaction motif. The available evidence on PKC signaling in diabetes and the presence of the PKC consensus site in close proximity to the β-arrestin2 interaction motif support our hypothesis that hyperglycemia influences nephrin endocytosis via PKC signaling. In the present study, we examined the role of PKC in β-arrestin2-mediated nephrin endocytosis and its effect on the slit diaphragm integrity in vitro and in vivo to elucidate the mechanism underlying the loss of surface nephrin and subsequent albuminuria upon hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus.DISCUSSIONThis study shows that a short duration of hyperglycemia is sufficient to induce proteinuria, a finding supporting our hypothesis that a high blood glucose level induces leakiness of the glomerular filter by increased nephrin endocytosis. This result is also in line with earlier findings that diabetic podocytes show a change in their nephrin staining pattern from surface expression to cytoplasmic distribution, suggesting increased internalization of nephrin (29Aaltonen P. Luimula P. Aström E. Palmen T. Grönholm T. Palojoki E. Jaakkola I. Ahola H. Tikkanen I. Holthöfer H. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As we have previously demonstrated, nephrin endocytosis is mediated by the interaction of β-arrestin2 and nephrin (15Quack I. Rump L.C. Gerke P. Walther I. Vinke T. Vonend O. Grunwald T. Sellin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 14110-14115Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). By our present study, we have shown for the first time that a high glucose milieu rapidly enhances the interaction of β-arrestin2 and nephrin in a dose-dependent manner.The interaction of β-arrestin2 is usually regulated by the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues of its targets (30DeWire S.M. Ahn S. Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). A sequence scan of the nephrin intracellular domain has revealed a PKC consensus site within the predicted β-arrestin2 binding domain (31Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). However, the PKC family comprises 12 isozymes, and at least three contribute to diabetic kidney damage (13Meier M. Menne J. Haller H. Diabetologia. 2009; 52: 765-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support PKCα as the candidate kinase involved in nephrin endocytosis in hyperglycemia. First, PKCα mediates β-arrestin2 binding to other single transmembrane receptors such as the TGFβ receptor (23Tossidou I. Starker G. Kruger J. Meier M. Leitges M. Haller H. Schiffer M. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2009; 24: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Second, PKCα deficiency prevents albuminuria in diabetic mice (12Menne J. Meier M. Park J.K. Boehne M. Kirsch T. Lindschau C. Ociepka R. Leitges M. Rinta-Valkama J. Holthofer H. Haller H. Kidney Int. 2006; 70: 1456-1462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Third, hyperglycemia increases the formation of diacylglycerol, which activates PKC (32Noh H. King G.L. Kidney Int. Suppl. 2007; 106: S49-S53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Indeed, suppression of PKCα activity or knockdown with siRNA abrogated the effect of a high glucose concentration, because no further increase in the β-arrestin2-nephrin interaction could be measured in our experimental setup. In line with these results, no β-arrestin2 binding was observed in PKCα-deficient podocytes.Sequence analysis of the nephrin intracellular domain predicted a PKC recognition motif ((S/T)XX(K/R)) and a putative β-arrestin2 binding motif ((S/T)X4–5(S/T); nephrin amino acids 1120–1125; TGERDT) in close proximity. This indicated that PKCα regulates the binding of β-arrestin2 by the phosphorylation of threonine residues within the β-arrestin2 binding motif in the nephrin intracellular domain. Indeed, the in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that PKCα was recruited to the nephrin intracellular domain and phosphorylated threonine residues 1120 and 1125. Simultaneous mutation of threonine residues 1120 and 1125 abrogated the binding of β-arrestin2 to nephrin completely, confirming the relevance of the nephrin TGERDT motif as the binding motif of β-arrestin2. In other transmembrane receptor systems phosphorylated by PKCα, PICK1 serves as an adaptor molecule for PKCα (26Hanley J.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 2008; 118: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed recruitment of PICK1 to the complex of nephrin, PKCα, and β-arrestin2. Because our results suggested that high glucose concentrations markedly enhance the interaction of nephrin and β-arrestin2, we examined whether stronger binding of β-arrestin2 leads to increased endocytosis of nephrin. An increase in the glucose concentration enhanced nephrin endocytosis significantly. Depletion of PICK1 or PKCα attenuated the endocytosis and prevented the loss of nephrin surface expression nearly completely. In accordance with our results, the role of PKCα in diabetic nephrin endocytosis was confirmed very recently by Tossidou et al. (33Tossidou I. Teng B. Menne J. Shushakova N. Park J.K. Becker J.U. Modde F. Leitges M. Haller H. Schiffer M. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10185Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has been recently reported that nephrin traffics via raft- or clathrin-mediated endocytosis (34Qin X.S. Tsukaguchi H. Shono A. Yamamoto A. Kurihara H. Doi T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 2534-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). From other receptors, it is known that β-arrestin2-dependent endocytosis mainly utilizes the clathrin pathway. As presumed, we noted markedly decreased endocytosis of nephrin after inhibition of the clathrin-dependent pathway.According to our results, acute hyperglycemia causes albuminuria. De facto, we demonstrated that mice with an episode of severe hyperglycemia over 24 h develop a significant increase in urinary albumin excretion. Our observations are backed by the very recent finding that hyperglycemia induced by glucose infusion increases glomerular permeability in nondiabetic rats; the change in glomerular size selectivity was not related to hyperosmolarity and was reversed after the glucose infusion was ceased (14Axelsson J. Rippe A. Rippe B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2010; 298: F1306-F1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).In summary, the present study shows that acute hyperglycemia in diabetes increases nephrin endocytosis in a PKCα- and PICK-dependent manner and thus causes albuminuria (Fig. 8). Conceivably, acute events such as increased nephrin endocytosis serve as an ignition spark for chronically altered slit diaphragm signaling in long standing hyperglycemia. We are convinced that PKCα and PICK1 are promising therapeutic targets for diabetic nephropathy. IntroductionDiabetes mellitus is a major health problem in Western countries.

Conceptually, the potency of an estrogen in activating a cellular response should reflect the affinities that characterize both steps involved in the assembly of the active ligand·receptor·coactivator complex.

We used this system to characterize the binding and potency of 12 estrogens with both ERα and ERβ. Some ligands showed good correlations between ligand binding affinity, coactivator binding affinity, and coactivator recruitment potency with both ERs, whereas others showed correlations with only one ER subtype or displayed discordant coactivator recruitment potencies. When ligands with low receptor binding affinity but high coactivator recruitment potencies to ERβ were evaluated in cell-based assays, elevation of cellular coactivator levels significantly and selectively improved their potency.

We have previously found that early growth responsive gene-1 (Egr-1), a zinc finger transcription factor, is highly expressed in db/db mice and in the fat tissue of individuals with type 2 diabetes. In this report, we found that chronic exposure to hyperinsulinism caused persistent Erk/MAPK activity in adipocytes and enhanced insulin resistance in an Egr-1-dependent manner. An elevation in Egr-1 augmented Erk1/2 activation via geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS). Egr-1-promoted GGPPS transcription increased Ras prenylation and caused Erk1/2 activation. The sustained activation of Erk1/2 resulted in the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 at Serine 612. Phosphorylation at this site impaired insulin signaling in adipocytes and reduced glucose uptake. The loss of Egr-1 function, knockdown of GGPPS, or inhibition of Erk1/2 activity in insulin-resistant adipocytes restored insulin receptor substrate-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and increased insulin sensitivity. Our results suggest a new mechanism by which the Egr-1/GGPPS/Erk1/2 pathway is responsible for insulin resistance during hyperinsulinism.

IntroductionInsulin resistance prevents insulin-responsive tissues, such as adipose tissue, liver, and muscle, from reacting to insulin and taking up the glucose that circulates in plasma. When adipocytes and others become less sensitive and more resistant to the insulin, the pancreas increases secretion, and the level of insulin in the blood rises to maintain normal glucose levels (1Guilherme A. Virbasius J.V. Puri V. Czech M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). However, if insulin resistance worsens, the glucose levels will begin to rise, both of which are major symptoms of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Consequently, those with type 2 diabetes mellitus normally experience hyperinsulinism for many years before clinic characteristics occur (1Guilherme A. Virbasius J.V. Puri V. Czech M.P. Nat. Rev.

However, IRS-1 is instead phosphorylated at several other sites in insulin-resistant rodents (e.g. Ser307, Ser612, Ser636, and Ser639) and type 2 diabetes patients (e.g. Ser312 and Ser616), all of which negatively regulate IRS-1 activity and block insulin signal transduction (4Aguirre V.

It has been reported that insulin-stimulated Erk1/2 and JNK are able to modulate the phosphorylation of IRS-1. The activation of JNK can enhance the phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser307; this action not only impairs IRS-1 function by inhibiting its interaction with the insulin receptor but also promotes the degradation of the IRS-1 protein (11Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Erk1/2 has also been shown to attenuate insulin signaling via Ser612 phosphorylation of IRS-1 (5Bard-Chapeau E.A. Hevener A.L. Long S. Zhang E.E. Olefsky J.M. Feng G.S. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, augmenting PI3K/Akt signaling and blocking MAPK signaling may prevent the development of insulin resistance and increase insulin sensitivity during stress; these pathways may therefore serve as targets for the development of pharmacological interventions.In insulin-resistant patients, insulin target tissues cannot initiate glucose uptake because of their lack of response to insulin stimulation; however, insulin-resistant adipocytes have certain genes, such as mcp-1, fra-1, and egr-1, that can maintain sensitivity to insulin (9Sartipy P. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52298-52306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Egr-1 (early growth response gene-1) is a member of the immediate early gene family characterized by zinc finger domains that recognize the highly conserved consensus GC-rich nucleotide sequences (GCG (G/T)GG GCG) (12Hamilton T.B. Borel F. Romaniuk P.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2051-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 13Silverman E.S. Collins T. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 665-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Egr-1 can be transiently activated by many cytokines and hormones, including insulin, through the MAPK pathway (14Hodge C. Liao J. Stofega M. Guan K. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31327-31336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 15Keeton A.B. Bortoff K.D. Bennett W.L. Franklin J.L. Venable D.Y. Messina J.L. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5402-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, as a transcription factor, Egr-1 can bind to target sequences and regulate the expression of many genes, such as TNF-α, PTEN, and SOCS-1 (16Yao J. Mackman N. Edgington T.S. Fan S.T. J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 2596-2605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Also, Egr-1 can exert its inhibitory effect on adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells (19Boyle K.B. Hadaschik D. Virtue S. Cawthorn W.P. Ridley S.H. O'Rahilly S. Siddle K. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 782-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that Egr-1 may augment Erk1/2 MAPK pathway signaling through its target gene geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS). GGPPS is a branch point enzyme in the mevalonate pathway that catalyzes the synthesis of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). GGPP and farnesyl pyrophosphate are used for the geranylgeranylation of proteins, such as Ras and Ras-related small GTP-binding proteins, with a CAAX motif at the C terminus (20Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar).We hypothesize that long term hyperinsulinism overactivates Egr-1 and causes sustained activation of MAPK in a GGPPS transcription-dependent manner. This results in an increase in serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 that leads to impaired PI3K/Akt activity followed by enhanced insulin resistance. This mechanism explains how hyperinsulinism enhances insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, we provide in vivo and in vitro evidence that the Egr-1/GGPPS/Erk1/2 pathway is essential for the development of insulin resistance. Loss of Egr-1 function in the insulin-resistant adipocytes reduced the phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser612, thereby restoring the activity of IRS-1, the PI3K/Akt pathway, and glucose uptake. Our results suggest that the Egr-1/GGPPS/Erk1/2 pathway may be a promising target for the development of pharmacological inhibitors designed to prevent insulin resistance and increase insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes mellitus.DISCUSSIONInsulin activates two signaling pathways: PI3K/AKT and MAPK. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 associates with the p85 subunit of PI3K and activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, which promotes glucose uptake and glycogenesis (3Wick K.R. Werner E.D. Langlais P. Ramos F.J. Dong L.Q. Shoelson S.E. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8460-8467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 34Biddinger S.B. Kahn C.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 123-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Insulin stimulation also activates MAPK (Erk1/2) and the SAPKs (JNK and p38), which result in cell growth (35Begum N. Song Y. Rienzie J. Ragolia L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1998; 275: C42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Weng L.P. Smith W.M. Brown J.L. Eng C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These two signaling pathways, PI3K/AKT and MAPK, can both be triggered by insulin under normal physiological conditions. However, during insulin resistance development, the balance of PI3K/Akt and MAPK might be impaired by long term hyperinsulinism (37Samuelsson A.M. Bollano E. Mobini R. Larsson B.M. Omerovic E. Fu M. Waagstein F. Holmäng A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 291: H787-H796Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The PI3K/AKT signal is disrupted by serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, whereas the MAPK pathway is still augmented and leads to insulin resistance (38Cusi K. Maezono K. Osman A. Pendergrass M. Patti M.E. Pratipanawatr T. DeFronzo R.A. Kahn C.R. Mandarino L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Benz et al. (39Benz A.H. Shajari M. Peruzki N. Dehghani F. Maronde E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2010; 160: 1621-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have reported that Egr-1 can be induced by FGF-1 via increase of MAPK and inhibition of AKT/PKB in hippocampal neurons. They found that when the phosphorylated MAPK reached maximal activation, the phosphorylated AKT was at its lowest levels. This suggested an interaction between MEK-1/2 and PI3K during Egr-1 induction. However, it is still not clear what causes the imbalance between PI3K/AKT signaling and the MAPK pathway. In this study, our results suggest that Egr-1 and its target gene GGPPS may be involved in insulin resistance through the sustained activation of Erk/MAPK signaling during prolonged exposure to above normal level of insulin that resulted from insulin resistance. Such an exposure in adipocytes would decrease tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 but increase serine phosphorylation, thereby further decreasing insulin sensitivity. This increase in the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 depends on the sustained activation of Erk1/2 that is controlled by Egr-1-regulated GGPPS transcription. Our results provide a new mechanism by which the Egr-1/GGPPS/Erk1/2 pathway could impair insulin signaling: phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Serine 612.GGPPS is a branch point enzyme in the mevalonate pathway that catalyzes the synthesis of GGPP. This isoprenoid may be used for Ras prenylation and then results in Ras membrane translocation and Ras-Raf-MAPK signaling pathway activation (20Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 40Kainou T. Kawamura K. Tanaka K. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We found that Egr-1 may provide positive feedback to regulate Ras/MAPK/Erk1/2 activation through its target gene GGPPS under hyperinsulinism stress (Fig. 5). dnEgr-1 overexpression largely impaired GGPPS transcription induced by insulin in IR adipocytes. Furthermore, the overexpression of exogenous Egr-1 significantly increased Ras prenylation and Erk1/2 activation, which were highly dependent on Egr-1-promoted GGPPS transcription. The biological significance is that long term hyperinsulinism will stress insulin-sensitive tissues, such as fat, and evokes sustained activation of Erk1/2 by GGPPS-induced Ras prenylation. Sustained activation of Erk1/2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Serine 612 and blocks the interaction between IRS-1 and PI3K.IRS-1, a key molecule in insulin signaling, has several phosphorylation sites: whereas tyrosine phosphorylation activates IRS-1, phosphorylation on Ser307 (4Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), Ser612 (5Bard-Chapeau E.A. Hevener A.L. Long S. Zhang E.E. Olefsky J.M. Feng G.S. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and Ser636/639 (41Moeschel K. Beck A. Weigert C. Lammers R. Kalbacher H.

At a normal physiological level, insulin phosphorylates IRS-1 on tyrosine site (42Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation on Ser307 and Ser636/639 primarily results from inflammation-induced JNK activation, which is the major cause of obesity-related insulin resistance (4Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J.

Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29911-29918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar); phosphorylation on Ser612 is catalyzed by Erk1/2 (5Bard-Chapeau E.A. Hevener A.L. Long S. Zhang E.E. Olefsky J.M. Feng G.S. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A normal physiological level of insulin can activate both PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways through IRS-1 and Ras, respectively (44Bae S.S. Cho H. Mu J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49530-49536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 45Eringa E.C. Stehouwer C.D. van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. Ouwehand L. Westerhof N. Sipkema P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2004; 287: H2043-H2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the PI3K/AKT pathway is inhibited, whereas the MAPK pathway remains active during insulin resistance and hyperinsulinism (30Fujishiro M. Gotoh Y. Katagiri H. Sakoda H. Ogihara T. Anai M.

Invest. 2000; 105: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar); the balance between these two pathways is altered by an unknown mechanism. Our results indicate that the activation of Erk1/2 may be sustained by long term insulin stimulation in normal and insulin-resistant adipocytes. Erk1/2-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser612 increased as tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was decreased by Egr-1 in a GGPPS-dependent manner. Additionally, glucose uptake in adipocytes was impaired by Egr-1-activated GGPPS transcription and sustained Erk1/2 activation. Our results suggest that this pathway could serve as a target for the development of pharmacological treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus. As shown in this report, insulin signaling and glucose uptake were markedly restored when a dnEgr-1 adenovirus, GGPPS siRNA, and U0126 were introduced into insulin-resistant adipocytes.We showed for the first time that in insulin-resistant adipocytes, Egr-1 activates the MAPK pathway in response to insulin via a positive feedback mechanism involving a GGPPS-induced increase in Ras prenylation. The sustained activation of Erk1/2 in hyperinsulinism leads to the phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser612, which may inhibit the association of IRS-1 and PI3K (5Bard-Chapeau E.A. Hevener A.L. Long S.

In this way, hyperinsulinism leads to an imbalance in PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling that eventually further enhances insulin resistance and finally results in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Collectively, our results suggest that Egr-1 may be a perfect target for the development of a pharmacological treatment for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. IntroductionInsulin resistance prevents insulin-responsive tissues, such as adipose tissue, liver, and muscle, from reacting to insulin and taking up the glucose that circulates in plasma.

Hadaschik D. Virtue S. Cawthorn W.P. Ridley S.H. O'Rahilly S. Siddle K. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 782-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that Egr-1 may augment Erk1/2 MAPK pathway signaling through its target gene geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS). GGPPS is a branch point enzyme in the mevalonate pathway that catalyzes the synthesis of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). GGPP and farnesyl pyrophosphate are used for the geranylgeranylation of proteins, such as Ras and Ras-related small GTP-binding proteins, with a CAAX motif at the C terminus (20Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar).We hypothesize that long term hyperinsulinism overactivates Egr-1 and causes sustained activation of MAPK in a GGPPS transcription-dependent manner. This results in an increase in serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 that leads to impaired PI3K/Akt activity followed by enhanced insulin resistance. This mechanism explains how hyperinsulinism enhances insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, we provide in vivo and in vitro evidence that the Egr-1/GGPPS/Erk1/2 pathway is essential for the development of insulin resistance. Loss of Egr-1 function in the insulin-resistant adipocytes reduced the phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser612, thereby restoring the activity of IRS-1, the PI3K/Akt pathway, and glucose uptake. Our results suggest that the Egr-1/GGPPS/Erk1/2 pathway may be a promising target for the development of pharmacological inhibitors designed to prevent insulin resistance and increase insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes mellitus."

Endochondral bone formation including chondrocyte and osteoblast maturation is regulated by HDACs. Very little is known about the role HDACs play in osteoclast differentiation. It has been previously reported that HDAC inhibitors, trichostatin A and sodium butyrate, suppress osteoclast differentiation through multiple mechanisms. In this study, we report that suppression of HDAC3 expression similar to HDAC inhibitors inhibits osteoclast differentiation, whereas osteoclasts suppressed for HDAC7 expression had accelerated differentiation when compared with control cells. Mitf, a transcription factor, is necessary for osteoclast differentiation. We demonstrate that Mitf and HDAC7 interact in RAW 264 cells and osteoclasts. The transcriptional activity of Mitf is repressed by HDAC7. Lastly, we show that either the amino or the carboxyl terminus of HDAC7 is sufficient for transcriptional repression and that the repression of HDAC7 is insensitive to trichostatin A, indicating that HDAC7 represses Mitf at least in part by deacetylation-independent mechanism.

Formation of the skeleton is a complex process involving coordinated function of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Subsequently, bone homeostasis is maintained by osteoblasts, which synthesize mineralized bone, and osteoclasts, highly specialized multinuclear cells that resorb bone. Many skeletal diseases such as osteoporosis, Paget disease of bone, rheumatoid arthritis, and bone metastases arise from an imbalance in the relative activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Histone deacetylases are best known for promoting transcriptional repression and silencing through the removal of acetyl groups from histone core proteins at target gene promoters, resulting in a less transcriptionally active state (1Sengupta N. Seto E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). They also catalyze deacetylation of non-histone substrates, thereby regulating the stability or activity of their substrates (2Gregoretti I.V. Lee Y.M. Goodson H.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). The 18 human HDACs 3The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; HDI, HDAC inhibitor; TSA, trichostatin A; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; NaB, sodium butyrate; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; CtBP, C-terminal-binding protein. fall into four classes based on structural and biochemical characteristics. Class I HDACs include HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 8, whereas Class II HDACs include 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10. Class II HDACs are further subdivided into two subclasses, IIa and IIb. Class IIa HDACS (HDACs 4, 5, 7, and 9) can also interact with additional non-deacetylase co-repressor proteins to bring about transcriptional repression (1Sengupta N. Seto E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Broad spectrum HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) such as trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate (NaB) are thought to have an effect on cells by inhibition of HDACs. TSA is generally considered a nonspecific HDAC inhibitor as it has similar Ki for all isoforms examined (3Drummond D.C. Noble C.O. Kirpotin D.B. Guo Z. Scott G.K. Benz C.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 495-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), and NaB has been shown to inhibit all Class I and II HDACs. A number of HDACs regulate chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation and activity through interactions with transcription factors such as Runx2, Smads, Twist, and pRb (4Luo R.X. Postigo A.A.

HDIs, TSA, and NaB have been shown to inhibit receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-mediated osteoclast differentiation due to inhibition of c-fos expression, NF-κB-dependent transcription, and p38 MAP kinase activity (13Rahman M.M.

Hu et al. demonstrated that co-repressors CtBP, HDAC1, and Sin3A were present on Ctsk and Acp5 promoters when osteoclast precursors were stimulated with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), but their levels were significantly reduced following 3 days of combined stimulation with M-CSF and RANKL (16Hu R.

Mitf belongs to the MiT family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that regulate gene expression in a variety of cell types including melanocytes, macrophages, and osteoclasts (23Hemesath T.J. Steingrímsson E. McGill G. Hansen M.J. Vaught J. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Fisher D.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2770-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The MiT family includes Mitf, Tfe3, Tfeb, and Tfec (24Hershey C.L. Fisher D.E. Bone. 2004; 34: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Steingrímsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Annu.

The importance of Mitf in osteoclast differentiation is confirmed by the lack of osteoclast differentiation and the resulting osteopetrotic phenotype observed in mice homozygous for the Mitf (mi) allele. A similar osteopetrotic phenotype is also noted in the double mutants homozygous for the Mitf (vga) hypomorphic allele and the Tfe3 null allele (24Hershey C.L. Fisher D.E.

Recent results indicate that the Mitf complex integrates signals necessary for the appropriate temporal regulation of osteoclast genes such as Ctsk and Acp5 during differentiation. M-CSF signaling alone can regulate Mitf nuclear localization and recruitment of Mitf to target promoters (28Bronisz A. Sharma S.M. Hu R. Godlewski J. Tzivion G. Mansky K.C. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3897-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, Mitf does not activate gene expression with stimulation of M-CSF alone. Rather, combined stimulation with M-CSF and RANKL is required to induce expression of osteoclast differentiation genes (29Sharma S.M. Bronisz A. Hu R. Patel K. Mansky K.C. Sif S. Ostrowski M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15921-15929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In the current work, we demonstrate that suppression of HDAC3 by shRNA closely mirrors the inhibitory effect of HDIs on osteoclast formation. Unexpectedly, we show that suppression of HDAC7 has the opposite effect, enhancing osteoclast formation. Further experiments support a model in which HDAC7 inhibits osteoclast differentiation by repressing Mitf activity. Lastly, we show that repression of Mitf by HDAC7 is deacetylation-independent. Osteoclasts were isolated from bone marrow of mice as described previously. Bone marrow was flushed from femurs, and the resulting cells were cultured for 3 days in the presence of 50 ng/ml M-CSF on non-tissue culture-coated dishes. The adherent cell population, containing the osteoclasts, was cultured for the indicated times and amounts of M-CSF and RANKL. RAW 264.7 c4 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 25 units/ml penicillin, 25 mg/ml streptomycin. RAW 264.7 c4 is a cell clone derived in Dr. A. Ian Cassady's laboratory at the University of Queensland from commercially available RAW 264.7 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) that requires both M-CSF and RANKL for efficient differentiation into osteoclast-like cells, but not for growth or survival. These cells were a gift obtained from Dr. A. Ian Cassady and Dr. David Hume. The conditions for differentiating RAW 264.7 c4 cells into osteoclasts-like cells were previously described (28Bronisz A.

Differentiation of RAW 264.7c4 and osteoclasts were optimized using 10 ng/ml M-CSF and 60 ng/ml RANKL (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). NIH 3T3 and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 2% l-glutamine, and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). NIH 3T3 and 293T cells were transiently transfected by Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The luciferase activities were measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Polyclonal Mitf antibody was generated by 21st Century Biochemicals (Marlboro, MA) using a peptide containing mouse Mitf amino acids 85–96 as an immunogen. HDAC7 antibody (clone A7), Myc (clone 9E10), gal4 DNA binding domain (clone RK5C1), and actin (clone I-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; HDAC3 (clone 7G6C5) and histone H3 (9715) were purchased from Cell Signaling; and acetylated histone H3 (06-599) was purchased from Upstate/Millipore. M-CSF and RANKL were purchased from R&D Systems and used at 10 ng/ml (M-CSF) or 60 ng/ml (RANKL). TSA was used at 20 nm (Sigma). 24 h after transfection, the 293T cells were harvested in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Extracts were incubated with target antibody and protein A/G beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. On the next day, immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer. The bound proteins were resuspended in sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane, blocked, and blotted in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. On the next day, the blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody binding was detected using the ECL system (GE Healthcare). FLAG Mitf was previously described (28Bronisz A. Sharma S.M. Hu R. Godlewski J. Tzivion G. Mansky K.C. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Biol.

RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). 2 μg of purified total RNA was reverse-transcribed by the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using the MyiQ single-color real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) using 1 μl of the cDNA with 2× iQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad). Osteoclast genes were normalized to L4 RNA.

Cells were rinsed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and stained using the leukocyte acid phosphatase kit (Sigma-Aldrich, 387-A). Cells were photographed and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop to measure the number and size of TRAP-positive osteoclasts. After cells were TRAP-stained and photographed, cells were stained with DAPI (Molecular Probes) for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed and stained with Vybrant cell-labeling dye (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were photographed at 10× magnification and counted using Adobe Photoshop.

However, these data do not indicate the significance of individual HDACs to osteoclastogenesis. In light of its importance in regulating osteoblastic differentiation (11Schroeder T.M. Kahler R.A.

To this end, we made use of lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs against HDAC3 or a control shRNA. To ensure that any effects were due to specific knockdown of HDAC3, we compared two distinct shRNAs against HDAC3. Infection of murine bone marrow cultures with either HDAC3 shRNA reduced HDAC3 mRNA expression by ∼50% when compared with the control shRNA (Fig. 1A). We observed a similar reduction in HDAC3 protein levels when we infected RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 1B). Although control shRNA cultures readily formed TRAP-positive osteoclasts upon stimulation with RANKL, osteoclast formation was strongly reduced in cultures infected with either HDAC3 shRNA (Fig. 1C). Quantitative analysis of these cultures indicated that both the number and the size of TRAP-positive cells were significantly reduced in HDAC3 shRNA cultures when compared with the controls (Fig. 1, D and E). Similarly, quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that expression of osteoclast marker genes NFAT-c1, cathepsin K (Ctsk), and DC-STAMP was reduced in the HDAC3 shRNA cells (Fig. 1F). These data indicate that reduction of HDAC3 expression, like treatment with HDIs, impairs osteoclastogenesis and suggest that HDAC3 activity is necessary for osteoclast formation. We next examined the effect of suppressing expression of the Class II deacetylase, HDAC7. Infection of bone marrow cultures with the previously described HDAC7 shRNA vector (12Jensen E.D. Schroeder T.M. Bailey J. Gopalakrishnan R. Westendorf J.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2008; 23: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) or an HDAC7 shRNA purchased from Open Biosystems reduced HDAC7 mRNA levels by 16- or 10-fold, respectively, when compared with the control vector (Fig. 2A), and HDAC7 protein levels showed a clear reduction (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the HDAC3-suppressed cells, osteoclast differentiation in HDAC7-suppressed cultures was enhanced when compared with controls (Fig. 2C). The average size of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts in HDAC7-suppressed cells was increased 5.6- and 5.8-fold (Fig. 2E), and the mean number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells per well showed a 1.3- and 2.3-fold increase (Fig. 2D). Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that HDAC7-suppressed osteoclasts showed increased expression of osteoclast markers: Nfat-c1 (3.5-fold increase, p ≤ 0.009), Ctsk (5.5-fold increase, p ≤ 0.02), and DC-STAMP (12-fold increase, p ≤ 0.008, Fig. 2F). These results reveal that HDAC7 suppression enhances osteoclast formation, thus suggesting that HDAC7 activity inhibits osteoclastogenesis. To further test the hypothesis that HDAC7 inhibits osteoclastogenesis, we made use of a lentiviral vector to overexpress Myc-tagged HDAC7. Immunoblotting detected strong expression of a Myc-tagged protein of 115 kDa, the predicted molecular mass of HDAC7 (Fig. 3A). When these cultures were stimulated with RANKL, their differentiation into TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts was impaired when compared with control cells (Fig. 3B). Overexpression of Myc-HDAC7 reduced the number of TRAP-positive cells 17-fold (Fig. 3C) and reduced the size of the osteoclasts 1.75-fold (Fig. 3D). Expression of osteoclast marker genes NFAT-c1, Ctsk, and DC-STAMP was significantly reduced (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these data demonstrate that HDAC7 acts as an inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation. We next wanted to determine whether the enhanced osteoclast differentiation we detected with suppressed HDAC7 expression was due to increased fusion of osteoclast precursors. When we compared nuclei per cell, we detected a 1.8-fold increase in nuclei per cell in the osteoclasts expressing the shRNA against HDAC7 (Fig. 4A), whereas the number of nuclei per cell was not statistically different in the mycHDAC7-overexpressing osteoclasts when compared with the control-infected cells (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, we detected significantly more total nuclei (1.7-fold increase, p ≤ 0.009) in osteoclasts expressing the shRNA against HDAC7 when compared with the control-infected osteoclasts. We detected no difference in the total nuclei in the mycHDAC7-overexpressing osteoclasts when compared with the control-infected cells (Fig. 4B). The increase in the total number of nuclei that we detect in shHDAC7-expressing osteoclasts suggests that HDAC7 functions to decrease proliferation or increase apoptosis in osteoclasts. Mitf has been shown to activate the bcl2 promoter in melanocytes and osteoclasts (39McGill G.G. Horstmann M. Widlund H.R. Du J. Motyckova G. Nishimura E.K. Lin Y.L. Ramaswamy S. Avery W. Ding H.F.

We analyzed expression of bcl2 and detected a 3.75-fold increase in bcl2 expression in the HDAC7-suppressed cells when compared with control-infected cells (Fig. 4C). We detected no significant increase in bcl2 expression in the Myc-HDAC7-overexpressing cells when compared with the control-infected cells (Fig. 4C). The Mitf transcription factor is one of the essential regulators of osteoclast formation. Although treatment with M-CSF recruits Mitf to target gene promoters, co-stimulation with M-CSF and RANKL is necessary for efficient activation of Mitf-dependent transcription. This suggests that corepressors prior to stimulation with RANKL might inhibit Mitf targets. Based on its effect as an inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation, we hypothesized that HDAC7 might interact with Mitf. We immunoprecipitated lysates from RAW 264.7 c4, a stable subclone of the commercially available RAW 264.7 cells, or primary osteoclasts with an antibody against Mitf or an IgG control and examined the lysates by immunoblotting against HDAC7. We detected strong interaction between Mitf and HDAC7 in RAW 264.7 c4 cells (Fig. 5A). A similar interaction between Mitf and HDAC"
https://openalex.org/W2042598897,"p27Kip1 (p27) can have opposing roles during malignant transformation depending on cellular context: on one hand it functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cyclin–cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity in the nucleus and on the other it may adopt an oncogenic role that is less well understood. To gain further insight into the roles played by p27 during tumorigenesis, we compared the susceptibility with urethane-induced tumorigenesis of two p27 mouse models, p27−/− and p27CK− knockin, in which p27 cannot bind or inhibit cyclin–CDKs. In this K-Ras-driven tumorigenesis model, p27CK− mice had an increase in both tumor number and aggressiveness compared with p27−/−, indicating a cooperation between p27CK− and activated Ras. In the lung, increased tumorigenesis was associated with cytoplasmic localization of p27CK− and bronchiolaveolar stem cell amplification. The ability of p27CK− to cooperate with other oncogenes was not universal. When c-Myc was used as a transforming agent, p27 status became irrelevant and c-Myc was equally potent in transforming p27+/+, p27−/− and p27CK− cells. In fact, c-Myc induced the degradation of wild-type p27 via the Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF)–Skp2 pathway. In contrast, p27CK− levels were not affected by c-Myc expression, as p27CK− is insensitive to Skp2-mediated degradation because of its inability to bind cyclin E/CDK2. However, in presence of c-Myc, p27CK− remained mostly nuclear, providing an explanation for its inability to cooperate with Myc during transformation. Thus, we propose that the p27CK− protein needs to be localized in the cytoplasm in order to function as an oncogene, otherwise it just behaves similar to a null allele."
https://openalex.org/W2062251575,"Dual oxidase 2 is a member of the NADPH oxidase (Nox) gene family that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of thyroid hormone as well as in the inflammatory response of the upper airway mucosa and in wound healing, presumably through its ability to generate reactive oxygen species, including H2O2. The recently discovered overexpression of Duox2 in gastrointestinal malignancies, as well as our limited understanding of the regulation of Duox2 expression, led us to examine the effect of cytokines and growth factors on Duox2 in human tumor cells. We found that exposure of human pancreatic cancer cells to IFN-γ (but not other agents) produced a profound up-regulation of the expression of Duox2, and its cognate maturation factor DuoxA2, but not other members of the Nox family. Furthermore, increased Duox2/DuoxA2 expression was closely associated with a significant increase in the production of both intracellular reactive oxygen species and extracellular H2O2. Examination of IFN-γ-mediated signaling events demonstrated that in addition to the canonical Jak-Stat1 pathway, IFN-γ activated the p38-MAPK pathway in pancreatic cancer cells, and both played an important role in the induction of Duox2 by IFN-γ. Duox2 up-regulation following IFN-γ exposure is also directly associated with the binding of Stat1 to elements of the Duox2 promoter. Our findings suggest that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ initiates a Duox2-mediated reactive oxygen cascade in human pancreatic cancer cells; reactive oxygen species production in this setting could contribute to the pathophysiologic characteristics of these tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1979877575,"The protein kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B) is a critical signaling hub downstream of various cellular stimuli such as growth factors that control cell survival, growth, and proliferation. The activity of Akt is tightly regulated, and the aberrant activation of Akt is associated with diverse human diseases including cancer. Although it is well documented that the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2)-dependent phosphorylation of the Akt hydrophobic motif (Ser-473 in Akt1) is essential for full Akt activation, it remains unclear whether this phosphorylation has additional roles in regulating Akt activity. In this study, we found that abolishing Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation stabilizes Akt following agonist stimulation. The Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation promotes a Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination of Akt, resulting in its rapid proteasomal degradation. Moreover, blockade of this proteasomal degradation pathway prolongs agonist-induced Akt activation. These data reveal that mTORC2 plays a central role in regulating the Akt protein life cycle by first stabilizing Akt protein folding through the turn motif phosphorylation and then by promoting Akt protein degradation through the hydrophobic motif phosphorylation. Taken together, this study reveals that the Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and degradation is an important negative feedback regulation that specifically terminates Akt activation."
https://openalex.org/W2078687083,"Angiogenesis, or formation of new blood vessels, is crucial to cancer tumor growth. Tumor growth, progression, and metastasis are critically influenced by the production of the pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Promising anti-angiogenic drugs are currently available; however, their susceptibilities to drug resistance and long term toxicity are serious impediments to their use, thus requiring the development of new therapeutic approaches for safe and effective angiogenic inhibitors. In this work, peptides were designed to mimic the VEGF-binding site to its receptor VEGFR-2. The VEGF conformational peptide mimic, VEGF-P3(CYC), included two artificial cysteine residues, which upon cyclization constrained the peptide in a loop native-like conformation to better mimic the anti-parallel structure of VEGF. The engineered cyclic VEGF mimic peptide demonstrated the highest affinity to VEGFR-2 by surface plasmon resonance assay. The VEGF peptide mimics were evaluated as inhibitors in several in vitro assays in which VEGF-dependent signaling pathways were observed. All VEGF mimics inhibited VEGFR-2 phosphorylation with VEGF-P3(CYC) showing the highest inhibitory effects when compared with unstructured peptides. Additionally, we show in several angiogenic in vitro assays that all the VEGF mimics inhibited endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and network formation with the conformational VEGF-P3 (CYC) being the best. The VEGF-P3(CYC) also caused a significant delay in tumor development in a transgenic model of VEGF(+/-)Neu2-5(+/-). These results indicate that the structure-based design is important for the development of this peptidomimetic and for its anti-angiogenic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2061134559,"Heterotrimeric G proteins are molecular switches that control signal transduction, and their dysregulation can promote oncogenesis. Somatic mutations in GNAS, GNAI2 and GNAQ genes induce oncogenesis by rendering Gα subunits constitutively activated. Recently the first somatic mutation, arginine243 → histidine (R243H) in the GNAO1 (Gαo) gene was identified in breast carcinomas and shown to promote oncogenic transformation when introduced into cells. Here, we provide the molecular basis for the oncogenic properties of the Gαo R243H mutant. Using limited proteolysis assays, nucleotide-binding assays, and single-turnover and steady-state GTPase assays, we demonstrate that the oncogenic R234H mutation renders Gαo constitutively active by accelerating the rate of nucleotide exchange; however, this mutation does not affect Gαo's ability to become deactivated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) or by its intrinsic GTPase activity. This mechanism differs from that of previously reported oncogenic mutations that impair GTPase activity and GAP sensitivity without affecting nucleotide exchange. The constitutively active Gαo R243H mutant also enhances Src-STAT3 signaling in NIH-3T3 cells, a pathway previously shown to be directly triggered by active Gαo proteins to promote cellular transformation. Based on structural analyses, we propose that the enhanced rate of nucleotide exchange in Gαo R243H results from loss of the highly conserved electrostatic interaction of R243 with E43, located in the in the P-loop that represents the binding site for the α- and β-phosphates of the nucleotide. We conclude that the novel R234H mutation imparts oncogenic properties to Gαo by accelerating nucleotide exchange and rendering it constitutively active, thereby enhancing signaling pathways, for example, src-STAT3, responsible for neoplastic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1989191256,"It has been suggested that adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and 12 AMPK-related kinases (ARK), including novel (nua) kinase family 1 (NUAK1), are activated by master kinase LKB1, a major tumor suppressor. Apart from evidence to suggest that NUAK1 participates in induction of tumor survival, invasion and p53-independent cellular senescence, its detailed biological functions remain unclear. Here we showed that in the presence of wild-type LKB1, NUAK1 directly interacts with and phosphorylates p53 in vitro and in vivo. The phosphorylation of p53 induced by LKB1 required the kinase activity of NUAK1 and phosphorylation of NUAK1 at Thr211 by LKB1 was essential for its kinase activity, which leads to the conclusion that LKB1 activates NUAK1 and regulates phosphorylation of p53 through the NUAK1 kinase, at least partially. LKB1/NUAK1 activation leads to cell cycle arrest at the G(1)/S border by inducing expression of p21/WAF1. Under the regulation of LKB1, NUAK1 interacts with p53 in the nucleus and binds to the p53-responsive element of p21/WAF1 promoter. These findings have highlighted a novel role for NUAK1 in LKB1-related signaling pathways; NUAK1 can regulate cell proliferation and exert tumor suppression through direct interaction with p53."

We hypothesize that Onconase exerts an effect via downregulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFKβ) by specific microRNAs (miRNAs) and that interference of this pathway could have implications for MPM resistance to chemotherapy. Three immortalized MPM cell lines (H2959, H2373 and H2591) were exposed to Onconase at 0–20 μg/ml. Cell counts were measured at 48 and 72 h. Gene expression in miRNA-enriched RNA was validated by reverse transcription–PCR (RT–PCR). The functional implications of miRNA expression were evaluated by transfecting miRNA mimics or inhibitors into MPM cell lines, and performing Matrigel invasion, cell proliferation, soft agar colony formation and scratch closure assays. Effects on NFKβ expression and downstream targets including ABC transporters, BCL-xl and IAP were assessed by RT–PCR and western blotting. Treatment with 20 μg/ml of Onconase significantly decreased cell count and invasion. Hsa-miR-17* was significantly upregulated and hsa-miR-30c was significantly downregulated by Onconase treatment in all cell lines. Forced expression of hsa-miR-17* mimic and hsa-miR-30c inhibitor each significantly decreased functional activity of Onconase in all assays. NFKB1 (p50) expression and downstream targets were also decreased with Onconase treatment, as well as with forced expression of miRNA mimic and inhibitors. Onconase treatment caused a significant decrease in cell proliferation, invasion and in expression of certain miRNAs. Recapitulation of the resultant miRNA expression pattern with hsa-miR-17* mimic and hsa-miR-30c inhibitor resulted in downregulation of NFKB1 and reduced malignant behavior in functional assays. Thus, Onconase likely exerts its antitumor effect through these miRNAs."

We have previously reported that polymeric OPN (polyOPN), but not unpolymerized OPN (OPN*), attracts neutrophils in vitro by presenting an acquired binding site for integrin α9β1. Among many in vitro substrates for transglutaminase 2, only a few have evidence for in vivo polymerization and concomitant function. Although polyOPN has been identified in bone and aorta, the in vivo functional significance of polyOPN is unknown. To determine whether OPN polymerization contributes to neutrophil recruitment in vivo, we injected OPN* into the peritoneal space of mice. Polymeric OPN was detected by immunoblotting in the peritoneal wash of mice injected with OPN*, and both intraperitoneal and plasma OPN* levels were higher in mice injected with a polymerization-incompetent mutant, confirming that OPN* polymerizes in vivo. OPN* injection induced neutrophil accumulation, which was significantly less following injection of a mutant OPN that was incapable of polymerization. The importance of in vivo polymerization was further confirmed with cystamine, a transglutaminase inhibitor, which blocked the polymerization and attenuated OPN*-mediated neutrophil recruitment. The thrombin-cleaved N-terminal fragment of OPN, another ligand for α9β1, was not responsible for neutrophil accumulation because a thrombin cleavage-incompetent mutant recruited similar numbers of neutrophils as wild type OPN*. Neutrophil accumulation in response to both wild type and thrombin cleavage-incompetent OPN* was reduced in mice lacking the integrin α9 subunit in leukocytes, indicating that α9β1 is required for polymerization-induced recruitment. We have illustrated a physiological role of molecular polymerization by demonstrating acquired chemotactic properties for OPN."

https://openalex.org/W2162876496,"Methylglyoxal (MG), a reactive dicar-bonyl molecule, can modify protein to form advanced glycation endproducts. Increased MG level has been implicated in proliferative vascular diseases, but the underlying mechanisms are not clear yet. The serine/ threonine kinase, Akt, regulates multiple signaling pathways that control cell proliferation. Using mass spectrometric analysis, we have detected the modification of Akt1 by MG at Cys77. This structural modification increased Akt1 phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308. Akt1 phosphorylation and activity were also increased by MG treatment (<50 µM) in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). MG treatment of VSMCs led to increased DNA synthesis (EC50=5.8 µM), cell proliferation, phosphorylation of p21 and glycogen synthase kinase-3α/β (GSK-3α/β), and increased cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity. These effects of MG were significantly inhibited by silencing Akt1 or by an Akt inhibitor. Overexpression of Akt1 Cys77Ser mutant in HEK-293 cells increased cell proliferation and DNA synthesis, concurrent with an increase in Akt1 activity, which could not be further augmented by MG treatment. It is concluded that MG-induced VSMC proliferation is mediated by the activation of Akt1 via the modification of Akt1 at Cys77.—Chang, T., Wang, R., Olson, D. J. H., Mousseau, D. D., Ross, A. R.

Achondroplasia is a heterozygous disorder, and thus the affected individuals express both wild-type and mutant FGFR3. Yet heterodimerization in achondroplasia has not been characterized thus far. To investigate the formation of FGFR3 heterodimers in cellular membranes, we designed an FGFR3 construct that lacks the kinase domain, and we monitored the formation of inactive heterodimers between this construct and wild-type and mutant FGFR3. The formation of the inactive heterodimers depleted the pool of full-length receptors capable of forming active homodimers and ultimately reduced their phosphorylation. By analyzing the effect of the truncated FGFR3 on full-length receptor phosphorylation, we demonstrated that FGFR3 WT/G380R heterodimers form with lower probability than wild-type FGFR3 homodimers at low ligand concentration.

However, the relationship between IL-32 and tumor progression is still unknown. In this study, we investigated whether overexpression of IL-32 affects susceptibility of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells to NK cells. Interestingly, IL-32α-overexpressing CML cell lines, K562, Kcl22, and BV173, showed higher NK cell-mediated killing. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that overexpression of IL-32α induced increased expression of Fas and UL16-binding protein 2 (ULBP2) in CML cells. The direct relationship between overexpression of surface molecules by IL-32α and increased NK cell-mediated killing was confirmed by Fas or ULBP2 siRNA transfection. IL-32α-induced Fas and ULBP2 expression are regulated p38 MAPK. In addition, the transcription factor Ets1 plays a key role in ULBP2 specific expression by IL-32α overexpression in ULBP family members. Taken together, these data show that IL-32α stimulates Fas and ULBP2 expression via activation of p38 MAPK, which increases NK susceptibility of CML cells. Enhanced NK cell susceptibility of CML cells by IL-32α overexpression may improve the efficiency of NK cell-based immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2023119442,"Brief periods of ischemia do not damage the heart and can actually protect against reperfusion injury caused by extended ischemia. It is not known what causes the transition from protection to irreversible damage as ischemia progresses. c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 (JNK-1) is a stress-regulated kinase that is activated by reactive oxygen and thought to promote injury during severe acute myocardial infarction. Because some reports suggest that JNK-1 can also be protective, we hypothesized that the function of JNK-1 depends on the metabolic state of the heart at the time of reperfusion, a condition that changes progressively with duration of ischemia. Mice treated with JNK-1 inhibitors or transgenic mice wherein the JNK-1 gene was ablated were subjected to 5 or 20 min of ischemia followed by reperfusion. When JNK-1 was inactive, ischemia of only 5 min duration caused massive apoptosis, infarction, and negative remodeling that was equivalent to or greater than extended ischemia. Conversely, when ischemia was extended JNK-1 inactivation was protective. Mechanisms of the JNK-1 switch in function were investigated in vivo and in cultured cardiac myocytes. In vitro there was a comparable switch in the function of JNK-1 from protective when ATP levels were maintained during hypoxia to injurious when reoxygenation followed glucose and ATP depletion. Both apoptotic and necrotic death pathways were affected and responded reciprocally to JNK-1 inhibitors. JNK-1 differentially regulated Akt phosphorylation of the regulatory sites Ser-473 and Thr-450 and the catalytic Thr-308 site in vivo. The studies define a novel role for JNK-1 as a conditional survival kinase that protects the heart against brief but not protracted ischemia."

Reduced expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) on HPV-infected cells might be responsible for insufficient T cell response and contribute to HPV-associated malignancy. The viral gene product required for subversion of MHC I synthesis is the E7 oncoprotein. Although it has been suggested that high and low risk HPVs diverge in their ability to dysregulate MHC I expression, it is not known what sequence determinants of HPV-E7 are responsible for this important functional difference. To investigate this, we analyzed the capability to affect MHC I of a set of chimeric E7 variants containing sequence elements from either high risk HPV16 or low risk HPV11. HPV16-E7, but not HPV11-E7, causes significant diminution of mRNA synthesis and surface presentation of MHC I, which depend on histone deacetylase activity. Our experiments demonstrate that the C-terminal region within the zinc finger domain of HPV-E7 is responsible for the contrasting effects of HPV11- and HPV16-E7 on MHC I. By using different loss- and gain-of-function mutants of HPV11- and HPV16-E7, we identify for the first time a residue variation at position 88 that is highly critical for HPV16-E7-mediated suppression of MHC I. Furthermore, our studies suggest that residues at position 78, 80, and 88 build a minimal functional unit within HPV16-E7 required for binding and histone deacetylase recruitment to the MHC I promoter.

Outcome measures included respiratory mechanics, barrier integrity, leukocyte accumulation, and levels of select soluble mediators. TLR4-defective mice were more resistant to ALI, with significantly decreased perturbations in lung elastance and resistance, resulting in faster resolution of these parameters [resolution interval (R(i)); ∼6 vs. 12 h]. Vascular permeability changes and oxidative stress were also decreased in injured HeJ mice. These TLR4-defective mice paradoxically displayed increased lung neutrophils [(HeJ) 24×10(3) vs. (control) 13×10(3) cells/bronchoalveolar lavage]. Proresolving mechanisms for TLR4-defective animals included decreased eicosanoid biosynthesis, including cysteinyl leukotrienes (80% mean decrease) that mediated CysLT1 receptor-dependent vascular permeability changes; and induction of lung suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression that decreased TLR4-driven oxidative stress.

https://openalex.org/W2010440072,"Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor (NR) superfamily and regulate development, growth, and metabolism. Upon binding thyroid hormone, TR undergoes a conformational change that allows the release of corepressors and the recruitment of coactivators, which in turn regulate target gene transcription. Although a number of TR antagonists have been developed, most are analogs of the endogenous hormone that inhibit ligand binding. In a screen for inhibitors that block the association of TRβ with steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC2), we identified a novel methylsulfonylnitrobenzoate (MSNB)-containing series that blocks this interaction at micromolar concentrations. Here we have studied a series of MSNB analogs and characterized their structure activity relationships. MSNB members do not displace thyroid hormone T3 but instead act by direct displacement of SRC2. MSNB series members are selective for the TR over the androgen, vitamin D, and PPARγ NR members, and they antagonize thyroid hormone-activated transcription action in cells. The methylsulfonylnitro group is essential for TRβ antagonism. Side-chain alkylamine substituents showed better inhibitory activity than arylamine substituents. Mass spectrum analysis suggested that MSNB inhibitors bind irreversibly to Cys-298 within the AF-2 cleft of TRβ to disrupt SRC2 association."

Function and number of hEPCs decline in patients with cardiovascular disease, and therapeutic strategies to enhance hEPC function remain an important field of investigation. The Wnt signaling system, comprising 19 lipophilic proteins, regulates vascular patterning in the developing embryo. However, the effects of Wnts on hEPCs and the adult vasculature remain unclear. We demonstrate here that Wnt1 is expressed in a subset of endothelial cells lining the murine embryonic dorsal aorta and is reactivated in malignant angiosarcoma, suggesting a strong association of Wnt1 with angiogenesis. We investigate the effects of Wnt1 in enhancing hEPC function and blood flow to ischemic tissues and show that Wnt1 enhances the proliferative and angiogenic functions of hEPCs in a hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-dependent manner. Injection of Wnt1-expressing hEPCs increases blood flow and capillary density in murine ischemic hindlimbs. Furthermore, injection of Wnt1 protein alone similarly increases blood flow and capillary density in ischemic hindlimbs, and this effect is associated with increased HGF expression in ischemic muscle. These findings demonstrate that Wnt1, a marker of neural crest cells and hitherto unknown angiogenic function, is a novel angiogenic protein that is expressed in developing endothelial cells, exerts salutary effects on postnatal hEPCs, and can be therapeutically deployed to increase blood flow and angiogenesis in ischemic tissues.—Gherghe, C.

https://openalex.org/W2026675261,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a potent prometastatic factor in ovarian cancer, but the intracellular signaling events are not well understood. The classical Gα(q)-phospholipase C signal transduction pathway known to operate in the pituitary is not involved in GnRH actions at non-pituitary targets. Here we showed that GnRH treatment of ovarian cancer cells led to a rapid and remarkable tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 catenin (p120(ctn)), which was mediated by P-cadherin. The use of P-cadherin small interfering RNA or neutralizing antibodies to inhibit P-cadherin expression and function resulted in diminished p120(ctn) activation, confirming that the effect was P-cadherin specific. On exploring how P-cadherin, which lacks intrinsic kinase activity, might regulate the activation of p120(ctn), we found that P-cadherin could induce the ligand-independent activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R). Inhibition of IGF-1R expression or its activity significantly inhibited GnRH-induced p120(ctn) activation, and the subsequent cell migration and invasion. In addition, we showed that IGF-1R regulation by P-cadherin was associated with complex formation between IGF-1R and P-cadherin, and this regulation was also observed to be in vivo correlated with metastasis. Furthermore, using a mouse model of ovarian cancer metastasis, GnRH receptor knockdown was shown to diminish peritoneal dissemination of tumors and ascites formation. These findings suggest for the first time that GnRH can initiate an outside-in p120(ctn) signal transduction through the cross-talk between P-cadherin and IGF-1R, thus providing a novel molecular mechanism by which GnRH may control the high level of aggressiveness and invasion and metastasis potential that are characteristic of ovarian cancer."

The final self-adjuvanting product promotes strong humoral and/or cell-mediated immunity. A module containing common components of the vaccine (T helper cell epitope and the adjuvanting lipid moiety S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)propyl]cysteine) was assembled to enable a plug and play approach to vaccine assembly. The inclusion within the module of a chemical group with chemical properties complementary and orthogonal to a chemical group present in the target epitope allowed chemoselective ligation of the two vaccine components. The heat-stable enterotoxin of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli that requires strict conformational integrity for biological activity and the reproductive hormone luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone were used as the target epitopes for the antibody vaccines. An epitope from the acid polymerase of influenza virus was used to assemble a CD8+ T cell vaccine. Evaluation of each vaccine candidate in animals demonstrated the feasibility of the approach and that the type of immune response required, viz. antibody or cytotoxic T lymphocyte, dictates the nature of the chemical linkage between the module and target epitope. The use of a thioether bond between the module and target epitope had little or no adverse effect on antibody responses, whereas the use of a disulfide bond between the module and target epitope almost completely abrogated the antibody response. In contrast, better cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses were obtained when a disulfide bond was used.

The self-adjuvanting properties of lipopeptides abolish the need for additional, potentially toxic adjuvants in vaccine preparations because the lipid moiety Pam2Cys provides the required stimulatory signals to the immune system through engagement of toll-like receptors present on dendritic cells. This form of vaccine candidate is capable not only of inducing humoral and cell-mediated immunity depending on the nature of the target epitope(s) but also mucosal immunity if administered intranasally, a property that potentially removes the requirement for needle vaccine delivery (5Alphs H.H. Gambhira R. Karanam B. Roberts J.N. Jagu S. Schiller J.T. Zeng W. Jackson D.C. Roden R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5850-5855Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 6Batzloff M.R.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 4905-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The lipid moiety Pam2Cys can be attached to the N terminus of the peptide, giving the vaccine construct a linear orientation, or attached to the ϵ-amino group of the intervening lysine residue between the TH epitope and the target epitope, yielding a branched configuration. Branched lipopeptides demonstrate enhanced immunogenicity over their linear counterparts, a property that has been attributed to their superior stimulation of dendritic cells and improved solubility (9Zeng W. Ghosh S. Lau Y.F. Brown L.E. Jackson D.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4905-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Non-lipidated branched constructs also display greater resistance to proteolytic degradation (10Fitzmaurice C.J. Brown L.E. Kronin V. Jackson D.C. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition to study of the influence of the geometry of the construct on the immunogenicity of peptide vaccines, the strict requirement for the toll-like receptor-2 agonist activity of Pam2Cys has also been demonstrated in a recently study (11Zeng W. Eriksson E.M. Lew A. Jackson D.C. Mol. Immunol. 2011; 48: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of amino acid spacers between the lipid group and the epitopes of interest also contributes to the immunogenicity of the lipid component with serine or arginine spacers shown to be most effective (12Chua B.Y. Zeng W. Lau Y.F. Jackson D.C. Vaccine. 2007; 25: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Conventionally, a peptide vaccine comprising a TH epitope and a target epitope construct is synthesized in toto; the peptide sequence is synthesized contiguously before attachment of the lipid moiety. In most cases, this method of synthesis is simple and yields a product of reasonable quality. Occasionally, however, the peptide sequence may pose difficulties during synthesis, or the target epitope possesses a particular conformation that is necessary for the induction of antibodies capable of reacting with the native antigen. Such “conformational determinants” are difficult to fold correctly when part of long contiguous sequences that contain TH epitope sequences unrelated to the sequence that has to be folded correctly. To address these problems, we have developed a modular approach based on an earlier concept (13Zeng W. Ghosh S. Macris M. Pagnon J. Jackson D.C. Vaccine. 2001; 19: 3843-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that consists of the separate assembly of the lipidated self-adjuvanting module consisting of a TH cell epitope to which Pam2Cys is covalently attached (Pam2Cys-TH) and the target epitope. Orthogonal chemical groups with complementary reactivities incorporated into each component allow the subsequent chemoselective ligation of the two components to yield the lipidated peptide vaccine (see Fig. 1). To analyze antibody and CTL responses, two types of target epitopes were used in this study. 1) Antibody responses were studied using two target epitopes. (i) Human ST (STh) is an enterotoxin produced by enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli and has the sequence NSSNYC6C7ELC10C11NPAC15TGC18Y. The molecule contains 6 cysteine residues, which form three intramolecular disulfide bridges (Cys6-Cys11, Cys7-Cys15, and Cys10-Cys18) (14Shimonishi Y. Hidaka Y. Koizumi M. Hane M. Aimoto S. Takeda T. Miwatani T. Takeda Y. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This toxin is secreted by pathogenic strains of E. coli and causes diarrhea especially among children in developing countries. Antibodies directed to ST can neutralize the toxin and prevent the occurrence of diarrhea (15Taxt A. Aasland R. Sommerfelt H. Nataro J. Puntervoll P. Infect. Immun. 2010; 78: 1824-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), although ST itself is not immunogenic. (ii) Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone also known as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) with the sequence HWSYGLRPG is secreted by the hypothalamus and initiates a cascade of endocrine events that govern reproduction. We have shown that antibodies elicited by an LHRH-based lipopeptide vaccine prevent reproduction in males and females (9Zeng W. Ghosh S. Lau Y.F. Brown L.E. Jackson D.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4905-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 12Chua B.Y. Zeng W. Lau Y.F. Jackson D.C. Vaccine. 2007; 25: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Ghosh S.

Immunol. 2007; 44: 3724-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 2) CTL responses elicited by a module-based lipopeptide vaccine were studied by using a CD8+ T cell epitope (residues 224–236) from the acid polymerase (PA) of influenza virus that has the sequence SSLENFRAYV (19Belz G.T. Xie W. Altman J.D. Doherty P.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3486-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This epitope when incorporated into a conventionally synthesized branched lipopeptide vaccine candidate has been used successfully to elicit CD8+ T cell responses (20Day E.B. Zeng W. Doherty P.C. Jackson D.C. Kedzierska K. Turner S.J. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Each of these three target epitopes were assembled into lipopeptide vaccine candidates using a modular approach that is based on a lipidated TH epitope. Three TH epitopes were used: (i) TMV, which has the sequence KLIPNASLIENCTKAEL and is derived from the fusion protein of the Morbillivirus canine distemper virus (16Ghosh S. Walker J. Jackson D.C. Immunology. 2001; 104: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and which demonstrates promiscuity between different MHC class II molecules from the same and different species; (ii) TFLU, which is derived from the light chain of influenza virus hemagglutinin, has the sequence ALNNRFQIKGVELKS (21Jackson D.C. Drummer H.E. Brown L.E. Virology. 1994; 198: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar),and is an effective TH epitope in BALB/c mice; and (iii) TOVA, which is derived from ovalbumin, has the sequence ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR (22Robertson J.M. Jensen P.E. Evavold B.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4706-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and is an effective CD4+ TH epitope in C57BL/6 mice. All reagents, unless otherwise stated, were of analytical grade or its equivalent. Dichloromethane and N,N′-dimethylformamide, and palmitic acid were from Merck. O-Benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate was obtained from Novabiochem, and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole was from CEM Corp. (Matthews, NC). Diisopropylcarbodiimide and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were from Auspep (Parkville, Australia). 1,8-Diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, piperazine, dimethylaminopyridine, triisopropylsilane, and diisopropylethylamine were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Diethyl ether was from Merck, and phenol was obtained from BHD Laboratory Supplies (Poole, UK). Fmoc amino acids were obtained from either Auspep (Melbourne, Australia) or Merck. Boc-aminooxyacetic acid was obtained from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Peptides, lipopeptides, and lipopeptide modules were synthesized, purified, and characterized in house using Fmoc chemistry throughout as described elsewhere (5Alphs H.H. Gambhira R. Karanam B. Roberts J.N. Jagu S. Schiller J.T. Zeng W. Jackson D.C. Roden R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5850-5855Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11Zeng W. Eriksson E.M. Lew A. Jackson D.C. Mol. Immunol. 2011; 48: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Zeng W. Ghosh S. Macris M. Pagnon J. Jackson D.C. Vaccine. 2001; 19: 3843-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); the specific protocols used are detailed below. The lipopeptide vaccines used in this laboratory comprise three components: a TH epitope, the target epitope, and Pam2Cys, which assumes a branch within the overall lipopeptide structure (9Zeng W. Ghosh S. Lau Y.F. Brown L.E. Jackson D.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4905-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). This basic branched structure was maintained in the current study by building Pam2Cys into the TH epitope, and the whole was then ligated to the separately synthesized target epitope. Following synthesis of TH epitopes TMV, TFLU, and TOVA, Dde-Lys(Fmoc)-OH was coupled to the exposed N-terminal amino group, the Fmoc group present on the ϵ amino group of this N-terminal lysine residue was removed, and the peptide was lipidated as described previously (9Zeng W. Ghosh S. Lau Y.F. Brown L.E. Jackson D.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4905-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Once lipidation was complete, a Boc-protecting group was attached to the exposed amino group of the Pam2Cys group by coupling di-tert-butyl dicarbonate. The 1-[4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-1-ylidene]ethyl (Dde) group on the α amino group of the N-terminal lysine residue was then removed by treatment with 2% hydrazine hydrate (Fisons, Homebush, Australia) in N,N′-dimethylformamide for 10 min. Boc-aminooxyacetic acid was then coupled to the exposed α amino group. This procedure led to the production of Modules 1, 2, and 3, each of which contained an aminooxy group at the N terminus. For production of Modules 4 and 5, Boc-Cys(Trt)-OH was coupled to the exposed α amino group of lipidated peptides TFLU and TOVA, thereby providing an N-terminal thiol group for subsequent ligation to target epitopes. Lipidated modules were cleaved from the resin and purified according to the conditions described elsewhere (11Zeng W. Eriksson E.M. Lew A. Jackson D.C. Mol. Immunol. 2011; 48: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The N-terminal Asn residue of ST was omitted to expose Ser at the N terminus, which then allows oxidation to an aldehyde group (see below and Fig. 3). Orthogonal, pairwise protection of cysteine residues (see Fig. 3A) was used to ensure formation of the correct disulfide bond assignments within the ST sequence (23Gali H. Sieckman G.L. Hoffman T.J. Owen N.K. Mazuru D.G. Forte L.R. Volkert W.A. Bioconjug. Chem. 2002; 13: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Trityl (Trt)-protecting groups used at Cys5 and Cys10 were removed during the TFA cleavage procedure, and subsequent air oxidation catalyzed by 2,2′-dithiodipyridine was then performed for formation of the Cys5-Cys10 disulfide bond. The Cys6-Cys14 disulfide bond was formed by iodine-mediated deprotection and concomitant oxidation of the acetamidomethyl-protected cysteine residues used at these positions. Cysteine residues at positions 9 and 17 were protected with the t-butyl group, and formation of the Cys9-Cys17 disulfide bond was carried out in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in TFA. The final disulfide assignments are shown in Fig. 3B. ST, LHRH, and PA target epitopes were modified at their N termini to include a serine residue. Following purification of these target epitopes, an aldehyde functional group (CHO) was generated by oxidation of the N-terminal serine with sodium periodate as described previously (24Rose K. Zeng W. Regamey P.O. Chernushevich I.V. Standing K.G. Gaertner H.F. Bioconjug. Chem. 1996; 7: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Vaccines based on these targets were then assembled by chemoselective ligation between the aldehyde group and the aminooxy group present on the Pam2Cys-TH module (Fig. 2A). A 1.2-fold molar excess of purified CHO-ST (2.10 μmol; 4 mg) was dissolved in 800 μl of 50% ACN, 50% double distilled H2O, and 0.1% TFA (pH 2) and then exposed to Module 1 (1.75 μmol; 4.8 mg) (see Fig. 3C). The reaction mixture was held at room temperature for 2 h, and the ligation progress was monitored by analytical HPLC until the reaction was complete. The final product, ST-oxime-Pam2Cys-TFLU, was isolated by semipreparative HPLC and had a mass of 4,623 Da (expected mass, 4,623 Da) and a yield of 5.1 mg. Purified LHRH containing an aldehyde group at its N terminus (1.15 μmol; 1.45 mg) was dissolved with either lipidated Pam2Cys-TH Modules 1, 2, or 3 (0.575 μmol; 1.66 mg) in 400 μl of 50% ACN, 50% double distilled H2O, and 0.1% TFA (pH 2). The reaction was carried out for 2 h at room temperature with CHO-LHRH, and the products LHRH-oxime-Pam2Cys-TMV, LHRH-oxime-Pam2Cys-TFLU, and LHRH-oxime-Pam2Cys-TOVA were isolated (see Fig. 2A). The target epitopes LHRH and PA(224–236) were modified by coupling bromoacetic acid (Aldrich) to the exposed N-terminal amino group of the fully protected peptide while still attached to the solid support using symmetric anhydride chemistry. The bromoacetylated LHRH (Br-CH2CO-LHRH) and PA(224–236) (Br-CH2CO-PA) were then cleaved from the solid support and purified. Thioether bond formation between BrCH2CO-LHRH (1.0 μmol; 1.31 mg) and cysteine-containing lipidated Module 4 (0.5 μmol; 1.42 mg) was then carried out by dissolving both peptides in 400 μl of 4 m urea buffer (pH 4) to which 200 μl of pH 8.3 buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.5 m Tris (Bio-Rad) and 2 mm EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich)) had been added. The reaction was allowed to proceed in a light-proof container for 2 h at room temperature, and the final product, LHRH-thioether-Pam2Cys-TFLU, was then isolated. Under similar conditions and using either BrCH2CO-LHRH or BrCH2CO-PA and Module 5, the lipidated modular products LHRH-thioether-Pam2Cys-TOVA and PA-thioether-Pam2Cys-TOVA, respectively, were obtained (see Fig. 2B). The target epitopes LHRH and PA(224–236) were extended to include a cysteine residue at the N terminus while still attached to the solid phase support and then cleaved from the solid phase support, and at the same time, the side chain-protecting groups were removed. The lyophilized peptide powder Cys-LHRH or Cys-PA was dissolved in 50% ACN, 50% double distilled H2O, and 0.1% TFA to which a 0.5-fold molar excess of 2,2′-dithiodipyridine (Fluka) dissolved in 100% ACN was added. The reaction was held for 30 min at room temperature following which the thiopyridylcysteinyl-LHRH (tpCys-LHRH) or thiopyridylcysteinyl-PA (tpCys-PA) was identified and isolated using reverse phase HPLC and MS. Purified Module 4 (0.5 μmol; 1.42 mg) and a 2-fold molar excess of tpCys-LHRH were incubated in 400 μl of 50% ACN, 50% double distilled H2O, and 0.1% TFA (pH 2) at room temperature for 10 min. The final product, LHRH-disulfide-Pam2Cys-TFLU, was identified and purified by reverse phase HPLC and mass spectrometry (see Fig. 2C). The vaccine candidates LHRH-disulfide-Pam2Cys-TOVA and PA-disulfide-Pam2Cys-TOVA were obtained using tpCys-LHRH or tpCys-PA and Module 5 under similar conditions.

For antibody response studies, groups of five 6–8-week-old female BALB/c mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the base of the tail with 20 nmol of peptide-based immunogen delivered in saline (100 μl) on day 0 and again on day 21. Sera were prepared from blood taken at 3 weeks following primary inoculation and 10 days following the secondary inoculation. For CTL response studies, groups of three 6–8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized with methoxyflurane and inoculated intranasally with 25 nmol of the peptide immunogens delivered in saline (50 μl) or infected intranasally with 104 pfu of influenza virus A/HK-X-31 (HKX-31, H3N2) in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). ELISAs were conducted on serum samples as described previously (25Brown L.E. Murray J.M. Anders E.M. Tang X.L. White D.O. Tregear G.W. Jackson D.C. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using either LHRH or ST as coating antigen. The antibody titer was determined by expressing the reciprocal logarithmic dilution achieving an optical density of 0.2, which represents ∼5 times the background binding in the absence of anti-LHRH or anti-ST antibody. Fertility studies were carried out as described previously (18Zeng W. Pagnon J. Jackson D.C. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 3724-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, female mice were examined for their ability to drop litters following inoculation with peptide immunogens and exposure to untreated male mice. A male mouse was introduced to either two or three female mice 2 weeks after females had received the second dose of vaccine. Males were rotated between each group of females to expose each female to every male. Males and females were kept together for a total of 3 weeks at the end of which time males were removed and the females were kept under observation A group of female mice inoculated with saline was used as a control. Spleen and lung lymphocyte populations were recovered from mice 7 days following inoculation. Single cell suspensions were prepared from perfused lungs following enzymatic digestion with collagenase A (2 mg/ml; Roche Applied Science) or spleens by passing through a mesh sieve. Treatment with Tris-ammonium chloride (7.4% (w/v) ammonium chloride (Ajax Chemicals) and 2.06% (w/v) Tris) was used to lyse red blood cells. Cell counts were performed using a hemocytometer, and cell concentrations were adjusted to 1 × 107 cells/ml with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 12 mg/ml gentamycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all supplements were from Invitrogen) hereafter referred to as RF10. Cells from the spleen or lung were incubated for 5 h in 96-well U-bottomed plates (1 × 106 cells/well) in 200 μl of RF10 containing 1 μl/ml GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences) and 25 units/ml recombinant human IL-2 (Roche Applied Science) in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml PA(224–236) or the control peptide NP(366–374) (sequence ASNENMETM) from the nucleoprotein of influenza virus. Cells were washed in FACS buffer (PBS containing 1% FCS and 5 mm EDTA) before staining with peridinin chlorophyll protein-conjugated anti-CD8a-Cy5.5 (BD Pharmingen) on ice for 30 min. Following two washes, cells were fixed and permeabilized using reagents supplied in the Cytoperm/Cytofix kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a further two washes, cells were stained for 30 min on ice with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-IFNγ antibody (BD Pharmingen). After two additional washes, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Immunocytometry Systems), and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (version 4.6.2; Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). Analysis of in vivo CTL activity was performed according to the method of Coles et al. (26Coles R.M. Mueller S.N. Heath W.R. Carbone F.R. Brooks A.G. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) Target cells were prepared using splenocytes from naïve C57BL/6 mice that were stained with Vybrant® DiD cell labeling solution (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and then pulsed either with the unrelated peptide NP(366–374) or the peptide epitope PA(224–236) at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml or with medium alone at 37 °C for 60 min. Control cells that were exposed to medium only were also prepared. The three populations of cells were then labeled with low (100 nm), medium (1 μm), or high (5 μm) concentrations of 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Molecular Probes), respectively. A population (5 × 106 cells in 200 μl) comprising equal numbers of these differentially labeled cell populations was then administered intravenously on day 7 to groups of three female C57BL/6 mice that had been previously inoculated intranasally with either 25 nmol of contiguously synthesized lipopeptide or modular lipopeptides prepared as described above in saline, saline only, or 104 pfu of X-31 live influenza virus. Spleens were removed 16 h later and analyzed for the presence of CFSEhigh, CFSEmedium, and CFSElow cells by flow cytometry. Specific lysis of the two cell populations was calculated by determining the ratio of non-peptide-pulsed/peptide-pulsed target cells in vaccinated or virus-challenged mice compared with animals that received saline. All p values were calculated using a one-way analysis of variance with a 95% confidence interval using the Tukey test algorithm for post-test analyses. The lipopeptide vaccines used in our laboratory comprise three components: a TH epitope, the target epitope, and Pam2Cys, which assumes a branch within the overall lipopeptide structure (9Zeng W. Ghosh S. Lau Y.F. Brown L.E. Jackson D.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4905-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This basic branched structure was maintained in the current study by building Pam2Cys into the TH epitope (Fig. 1, A–C), and the whole was then ligated to the separately synthesized target epitope (Fig. 1D). Judicious use of appropriate heterobifunctional X and R groups introduced into the module and target epitope, respectively, allowed a variety of chemical linkages to be used to couple the two vaccine components (Fig. 2). STh is an 18-mer peptide and is non-immunogenic when administered alone (15Taxt A. Aasland R. Sommerfelt H. Nataro J. Puntervoll P. Infect. Immun. 2010; 78: 1824-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Previous reports have indicated that when chemically coupled or genetically fused to a protein carrier the ST-protein conjugate is able to elicit anti-ST antibody, and in some instances, the antiserum is able to neutralize the toxic activity of ST. In this study, we manufactured an analog of ST by chemical synthesis, omitting the N-terminal asparagine residue to expose a serine residue at this position and also replacing the C-terminal tyrosine residue with phenylalanine. We then folded the molecule into the correct conformation through specific disulfide assignments between the cysteine residues (Fig. 3, A and B) and determined its biological integrity in a suckling mouse assay (27Robins-Browne R.M. Levine M.M. Gastroenterology. 1981; 80: 321-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The results of this experiment (data not shown) indicated that the toxicity of the synthetic, folded STh analog was comparable with that of native STh, indicating the high fidelity of the synthesis and the folding process we used. The N-terminal serine residue of this totally synthetic and folded ST molecule was then oxidized to produce an N-terminal aldehyde group (Fig. 2B), which was ligated to a lipidated TH module using oxime chemistry (Figs. 2A and 3C). BALB/c mice were inoculated with the vaccine candidate ST-oxime-Pam2Cys-TMV both subcutaneously and intranasally on days 1 and 21. Sera were prepared from blood obtained on days 21 and 31, and ELISAs were performed to determine the antibody response using ST as the coating antigen. The results (Fig. 4) d"

IntroductionSorangium cellulosum So ce56 (So ce56) belongs to the quite heterogeneous group of myxobacteria, which represent Gram-negative soil δ-proteobacteria that show a complex live cycle involving a cooperative and cellular morphogenesis (1Pradella S. Hans A. Spröer C. Reichenbach H. Gerth K. Beyer S. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). They have the ability to form fruiting bodies under nutrition starvation and move in swarms. Gliding movement on surfaces and the differentiation processes require complex cell-to-cell signaling and reminds the process of differentiation in eukaryotic Dictyostelium. In the last decades a number of pharmaceutical metabolites (2Gerth K. Pradella S. Perlova O. Beyer S. Müller R. J. Biotechnol. 2003; 106: 233-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 3Gerth K.

Members of the genus Sorangium produce 46% of new bioactive secondary metabolites isolated from myxobacteria as yet (2Gerth K. Pradella S. Perlova O. Beyer S. Müller R. J. Biotechnol. 2003; 106: 233-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).So ce56, as a member of the suborder Sorangiineae, exhibits the largest bacterial genome entirely published so far. The recent genome sequencing revealed a huge chromosome of 13,033,779 base pairs, coding for 9,367 proteins over all (5Schneiker S. Perlova O. Kaiser O. Gerth K. Alici A. Altmeyer M.O. Bartels D.

Hobbs M. Valvano M.A. Skurnik M. Whitfield C. Coplin D. Kido N. Klena J. Maskell D. Raetz C.R. Rick P.D. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). One class of prominent Gram-negative surface carbohydrates are the lipopolysaccharides (LPS, endotoxin), which represent the main components of the outer leaflet of the OM. LPS have complex structures, usually consisting of three main components that are built by specific cellular machineries (7Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3277) Google Scholar), i.e. the O-antigen that extends into the extracellular medium, the core region, and the lipid A that anchors the molecule in the OM and, in toxic LPS, represents the endotoxic moiety of this molecule. The complex bacterial glycostructures present at the cell surface are important for interactions with their animate and inanimate environment. LPS play in addition an essential structural role as key constituents of the OM. In human, animal, and plant pathogenic bacteria LPS are often recognized by the particular hosts and provoke defense reactions. Only few Gram-negative bacteria are known that lack LPS, initially discovered in Sphingomonas (8Takayama K. Rothenberg R.J. Barbour A.G. Infect.

Instead, the OM contained a mixture of sphingo-, ornithine-containing, and ether lipids. The OM lipid composition of So ce56 was elucidated.DISCUSSIONAlthough LPS has been identified in several other myxobacterial species (33Sutherland I.W. Smith M.L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1973; 74: 259-266Crossref Google Scholar, 34Rosenfelder G. Lüderetz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the analysis of the genomic data and the absence of specific markers of LPS such as Kdo in phenol/water extracts show that S. cellulosum So ce56 lacks LPS as component of its OM. The absence of LPS in Gram-negative bacteria is still unusual, although proven for several Gram-negative bacteria, i.e. Treponema pallidum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia hispanica (8Takayama K.

Microbiol. 1979; 111: 211-216Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Further on, LPS was detected in Myxococcus xanthus, a myxobacterial species that is less related to Sorangium (5Schneiker S. Perlova O. Kaiser O. Gerth K. Alici A. Altmeyer M.O. Bartels D. Bekel T. Beyer S. Bode E. Bode H.B. Bolten C.J. Choudhuri J.V. Doss S. Elnakady Y.A. Frank B. Gaigalat L. Goesmann A. Groeger C.

Whitworth D.E. Wilhelm S. Wittmann C. Blöcker H. Pühler A. Müller R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The absence of LPS in So ce56 could be restricted to a small tree within this group of Gram-negative bacteria, because closely and more distantly related myxobacteria produce LPS. Even though LPS is missing the characteristic Gram-negative cell envelope consisting out of two membranes separated by an periplasmatic space could be confirmed by electron microscopy. As also shown by Lamky (27Lamky J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the OM is undulated, and the cells are surrounded by numerous OMVs. By analyzing the lipids of the OMVs, three different major lipid classes of the outer membrane of So ce56 with interesting features could be identified, i.e. SL, GEL, and OL.The first class representing the most abundant lipids of the outer membrane of So ce56 are the sphingolipids. Only two studies about sphingolipids in myxobacteria were reported earlier (36Eckau H. Dill D. Budzikiewicz H. Z. Naturforsch. C. 1984; 39: 1-9Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in which 17-methyl-C18-sphingosine (19:2) was described as the basic structure. The 9-methyl-sphingosine moiety has been unique to fungi and some marine invertebrates until now (37Sperling P. Heinz E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1632: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Here, we report on the structure of the first sphingolipid with a 9-methyl-C20-sphingosine (21:3 and 21:2) moiety discovered in bacteria. Zhang et al. (28Zhang Y. Wang S. Li X.M. Cui C.M. Feng C. Wang B.G. Lipids. 2007; 42: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) described the 21:2 structure as a lipid of Aspergillus niger with moderate antifungal activity. Interestingly, these sphingolipids were described as predominate mediators of development in fungi (38Ramamoorthy V. Cahoon E.B. Thokala M. Kaur J. Li J. Shah D.M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 39Kawai G. Ikeda Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 612-618Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 40Oura T. Kajiwara S. Microbiology. 2010; 156: 1234-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, a similar function of 9-methyl-sphingosine in myxobacterial development could be postulated. Another interesting point is the headgroup 2-aminoethylphosphonate (AEP) of the phosphonosphingolipid, because it is a natural product containing a carbon-phosphorus bond. Such C-P compounds have found widespread use in medicine and agriculture (41Metcalf W.W. van der Donk W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 65-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), which underlies the great potential of myxobacteria as a wealth for natural bioactive compounds. Phosphonolipids are very rare in nature. They were only described in the sea anemone Metridium senile (42Mason W.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 280: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the bacterium Bacteriovorax stolpii (43Steiner S. Conti S.F. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 116: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila (44Adosraku R.K. Smith J.D. Nicolaou A. Gibbons W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosphonosphingolipids of Bacteriovorax stolpii UKi2 show sensitivity to phospholipase C and resistance to phospholipase D (45Jayasimhulu K. Hunt S.M. Kaneshiro E.S. Watanabe Y. Giner J.L. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2007; 18: 394-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this context, the close phylogenetic relationship of myxobacteria to Bacteriovorax has to be mentioned (5Schneiker S. Perlova O. Kaiser O. Gerth K. Alici A. Altmeyer M.O. Bartels D. Bekel T. Beyer S. Bode E. Bode H.B. Bolten C.J. Choudhuri J.V. Doss S. Elnakady Y.A. Frank B. Gaigalat L. Goesmann A. Groeger C. Gross F. Jelsbak L. Jelsbak L. Kalinowski J. Kegler C. Knauber T. Konietzny S.

Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar).OL are widespread among Gram-negative bacteria and were found in some Gram-positive bacteria as well (46Geiger O. González-Silva N. López-Lara I.M. Sohlenkamp C. Prog. Lipid Res. 2010; 49: 46-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). They possess similarity to bacterial LPS amide-bound 3-OH fatty acids, the hydroxy groups of which are esterified with another fatty acid (acyloxyacyl groups) (47López-Lara I.M. Sohlenkamp C. Geiger O. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2003; 16: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, OL were also described in Sinorhizobium meliloti grown under phosphorous-limiting condition (48López-Lara I.M. Gao J.L. Soto M.J. Solares-Pérez A. Weissenmayer B. Sohlenkamp C. Verroios G.P. Thomas-Oates J. Geiger O. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2005; 18: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). OL have not been identified in myxobacteria before, thus, their role in myxobacterial life is completely unknown up to now.As a third class of lipids ether lipids could be identified. The major ether lipids are dialkyl ether lipids with a phosphoethanolamin or glucose as headgroup. Ether lipids as monoalkyl moiety have been proposed by Ring et al. (49Ring M.W. Schwär G. Thiel V. Dickschat J.S. Kroppenstedt R.M. Schulz S. Bode H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36691-36700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as new biomarkers for fruiting bodies formation in Myxococcus xanthus. A basic structure of 1-O-13-methyltetradecyl glycerol has been described. The same moiety was present in So ce56.The presence of dialkyl ether lipids could be confirmed from vegetative cells of the myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca (50Caillon E. Lubochinsky B. Rigomier D. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 1348-1351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate an occurrence of such ether lipids in myxobacteria and may play an important role in myxobacterial development. Besides phosphoethanolamine, we also identified glucose as a headgroup of the ether lipids. This headgroup together with the dialkyl moiety are described in myxobacteria for the first time. The functions of these ether lipids in myxobacteria are unknown.Taken together, we isolated and elucidated the complex lipid composition of the OM of S. cellulosum So ce56 with a total number of more than 50 lipids. These data and the fact that LPS is missing give new insights into the complex myxobacterial life cycle with a remarkable eukaryotic character of this bacterium. This is also reflected in marked similarities to eukaryotic regulatory network sytems (5Schneiker S. Perlova O. Kaiser O. Gerth K. Alici A. Altmeyer M.O. Bartels D. Bekel T. Beyer S. Bode E.

One class of prominent Gram-negative surface carbohydrates are the lipopolysaccharides (LPS, endotoxin), which represent the main components of the outer leaflet of the OM. LPS have complex structures, usually consisting of three main components that are built by specific cellular machineries (7Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev.

The complex bacterial glycostructures present at the cell surface are important for interactions with their animate and inanimate environment. LPS play in addition an essential structural role as key constituents of the OM. In human, animal, and plant pathogenic bacteria LPS are often recognized by the particular hosts and provoke defense reactions.

IntroductionIn eukaryotic cells, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) 3The abbreviations used are: UPS, ubiquitin-proteasome system; PQC, protein quality control; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ts, temperature-sensitive; Ubi, ubiquitin; CHX, cycloheximide. has a pivotal role in multiple cellular events, including the cell cycle, signal transduction, and receptor-mediated endocytosis (1Hershko A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 788-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar, 3Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). This system is essential for the selective degradation of many cellular proteins. The substrate proteins destined for degradation are first recognized by the ubiquitination machinery, triggering the covalent attachment of a polyubiquitin chain to the target protein. Polyubiquitinated proteins are recognized and degraded by the 26 S proteasome. The formation of the polyubiquitin chain is accomplished by a series of enzymatic reactions catalyzed by three enzymes: an E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), an E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), and an E3 (ubiquitin ligase). The step catalyzed by the E3 is crucial in determining substrate selectivity and timing of degradation, which implies that the identification and understanding of E3s is important to elucidate the mechanisms of specific substrate selection.The UPS also contributes to cellular protein quality control (PQC) (4Goldberg A.L. Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). Aberrant or misfolded proteins are produced in the cell by mutation or environmental stress. The intracellular accumulation of these proteins causes proteotoxic or harmful effects. In humans, for example, the accumulation of aberrant proteins is thought to be associated with diseases such as Alzheimer, Huntington, Parkinson, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases (5Shastry B.S. Neurochem. Int. 2003; 43: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The removal of these harmful proteins and the maintenance of homeostasis are accomplished through the selective degradation of aberrant or misfolded proteins by the UPS. The involvement of the UPS in PQC in the cytoplasm and in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have been well studied, and several E3s for PQC have been identified, including Hrd1 and Doa10, which are involved in ER-associated degradation (6Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), as well as CHIP (7Murata S. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and Ubr1 (8Heck J.W. Cheung S.K. Hampton R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1106-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), both of which are associated with cytoplasmic PQC.In contrast, the study of nuclear PQC has been very limited to date. The lack of activity of the autophagy-lysosome system in the nucleus (9Iwata A. Christianson J.C. Bucci M. Ellerby L.M. Nukina N. Forno L.S. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13135-13140Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) suggests that nuclear PQC depends entirely on the UPS. Supporting this hypothesis, studies demonstrated that the San1 E3 ligase, which shows specificity for nuclear aberrant proteins, plays a pivotal role in nuclear PQC in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (10Dasgupta A.

Cell. 2005; 120: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies in mammalian cells and primary neurons suggest that the UHRF-2 E3 ligase is an essential molecule for nuclear polyglutamine degradation as a component of the nuclear PQC machinery (12Iwata A. Nagashima Y. Matsumoto L. Suzuki T. Yamanaka T. Date H. Deoka K. Nukina N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9796-9803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The high cellular toxicity of aberrant nuclear protein aggregates and their likely association with the neurodegenerative pathology of Huntington disease underscores the importance of investigating the role of nuclear PQC (5Shastry B.S. Neurochem. Int. 2003; 43: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).In the present study, the existence of a nuclear PQC system that functions through the UPS is demonstrated in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. A mutant form of Asf1 (Asf1-30) was used as a substrate for the study of the nuclear PQC system. Asf1 (anti-silencing function 1) was originally identified as a protein whose overexpression inhibits the silencing of chromatin in S. cerevisiae (13Le S. Davis C. Konopka J.B. Sternglanz R. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1029-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and subsequently as a complex with histones H3/H4 that could facilitate the replication-coupled assembly of nucleosomes by CAF1 in vitro (14Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Asf1 is now recognized as a histone chaperone in a wide variety of eukaryotes, including humans (15Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The results of the present study show that Ubc4 (E2) and San1 (E3) are the enzymes catalyzing the degradation of the Asf1-30 mutant protein. This is the first report identifying the molecules responsible for nuclear PQC in S. pombe.DISCUSSIONThe results of the present study show that the selective degradation of nuclear aberrant proteins mediates nuclear PQC in the fission yeast S. pombe. Although nuclear PQC has been reported in budding yeast and mammals (11Gardner R.G. Nelson Z.W. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2005; 120: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 12Iwata A. Nagashima Y. Matsumoto L. Suzuki T. Yamanaka T. Date H. Deoka K. Nukina N. Tsuji S. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1977-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms of nuclear PQC in other organisms, including S. pombe, have not been elucidated. The present work demonstrates the instability of the mutant nuclear protein Asf1-30 at higher temperatures and its selective degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Although the present work only addresses the instability of Asf1-30, other nuclear mutant proteins (Mis12-537, Orc5-H37, Cnp1-1, Pim1-46, and Sad1-1) have also been found to be unstable at high temperatures (40Goshima G. Iwasaki O. Obuse C. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2752-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 41Kato H. Matsunaga F. Miyazaki S. Yin L. D'Urso G. Tanaka K. Murakami Y. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 42Chen E.S. Saitoh S. Yanagida M. Takahashi K. Mol.

Cell. 1993; 4: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 44Hagan I. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1033-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), suggesting that these mutant proteins could also be processed by the UPS. In fact, deletion of the san1 gene suppressed the temperature sensitivity of the mis12-537, cnp1-1, and pim1-46 mutants at semirestrictive temperature (Fig. 8, A–C). Furthermore, the instability of Cnp1-1 proteins was suppressed at the restrictive temperature in the san1 disruptant (Fig. 8D). These data suggested that San1 is involved in polyubiquitination and degradation of a variety of nuclear mutant proteins in S. pombe.The Ubc4 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) was required for Asf1-30 degradation, and San1 was identified as the E3 ligase catalyzing the polyubiquitination of the Asf1-30 mutant protein. S. pombe Ubc4 is essential for growth and is responsible for the polyubiquitination of mitotic cyclin Cdc13 (34Seino H. Kishi T. Nishitani H. Yamao F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3497-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Asf1-30 is therefore the second target of the E2 enzyme Ubc4 found to date. One unexpected finding was that different E2s mediate nuclear PQC in S. pombe and S. cerevisiae. In S. cerevisiae, the E2s Cdc34 and Ubc1 are associated with four distinct mutant nuclear proteins in the nuclear PQC (11Gardner R.G. Nelson Z.W. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2005; 120: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In the present work, the instability of Asf1-30 was not suppressed in S. pombe ubc15 (CDC34 orthologue) and ubc1 (UBC1 orthologue) mutants (Fig. 5A). Conversely, Ubc4 and Ubc5 (orthologues of Ubc4) are not required for degradation of mutant nuclear proteins in S. cerevisiae (11Gardner R.G. Nelson Z.W. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2005; 120: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Ubc4 and Ubc5 mediate the selective degradation of short lived and abnormal cytosolic proteins (46Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). These results suggest that different E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes are involved in the nuclear PQCs of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe.In contrast to the difference in nuclear PQC E2 enzymes between S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, the E3 enzyme San1 is active in both species. The san1 (sir antagonist) gene was originally identified as an extragenic suppressor of the sir4-9 mutant in S. cerevisiae (47Schnell R. D'Ari L. Foss M. Goodman D. Rine J. Genetics. 1989; 122: 29-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it was later shown to possess ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro, and this activity was required for the in vivo function of San1 (10Dasgupta A. Ramsey K.L. Smith J.S. Auble D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26830-26838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that San1 mediates the UPS involvement in the nuclear PQC of S. cerevisiae (11Gardner R.G. Nelson Z.W. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2005; 120: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition, ectopically expressed S. cerevisiae San1 enhanced the degradation of nuclear polyglutamine aggregates in cultured mammalian cells and thereby rescued polyglutamine-induced cytotoxicity (12Iwata A. Nagashima Y. Matsumoto L. Suzuki T. Yamanaka T. Date H. Deoka K. Nukina N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9796-9803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent reports show that the association between San1 and the E3 ligase Ubr1 is important for cytoplasmic PQC (8Heck J.W. Cheung S.K. Hampton R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1106-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The present work used a different strategy to identify San1 as a ligase involved in the nuclear PQC of S. pombe by selecting six gene/proteins among 100 E3 candidates based on three criteria: nuclear localization, proteins containing an E3 domain, and the up-regulation of genes by heat shock. The S. pombe San1 E3 ligase was identified as the enzyme mediating the polyubiquitination of the Asf1-30 protein (Fig. 6, B and C). Although the role of San1 in targeting Asf1-30 was clear, the finding that the instability of Asf1-30 was not completely suppressed in a san1 mutant (Fig. 6A) compared with the ubc4ts mutant (Fig. 5A) suggests that other proteins might be involved in PQC. This would also explain the moderate suppression of temperature sensitivity of the asf1-30 allele by the san1 deletion (Fig. 7A). Intriguingly, the temperature sensitivity of the ubc4ts or mts2-1 mutants was enhanced by a concomitant asf1-30 mutation (Fig. S2). The accumulation of an Asf1-30 protein might have a deleterious effect in those ubc4ts and mts2-1 mutants characterized by an impaired degradation of aberrant and harmful proteins, emphasizing the importance of the nuclear PQC for the removal of damaging proteins and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Alternatively, stable Asf1-30 mutant protein in those ubc4ts and mts2-1 mutants might affect the process of other target proteins of UPS.Although the transcription of the san1 gene was up-regulated under heat shock stress (38Chen D. Toone W.M. Mata J. Lyne R. Burns G. Kivinen K. Brazma A. Jones N. Bähler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 214-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), the amount of San1 protein was not dramatically changed under these conditions (Fig. 9C). Because the San1 protein is stable in response to heat shock (Fig. 9D), a supraliminal amount of San1 might be sufficient to function in nuclear PQC. The finding that the san1 mutant did not show any obvious phenotypes under various different stress conditions tested (data not shown) suggests that other E3 ligases might function in nuclear PQC in S. pombe. These results are consistent with the finding that there is no obvious growth difference between wild type and the san1 mutant under various conditions in S. cerevisiae (11Gardner R.G. Nelson Z.W. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2005; 120: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Because San1 is the only E3 reported to function in nuclear PQC in two yeast types, it would be of great interest to find and characterize the other E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in nuclear PQC.The cellular compartment where polyubiquitinated Asf1-30 is degraded in S. pombe remains unknown. In S. pombe, the 26 S proteasome is enriched in the nucleus and nuclear periphery, both during interphase and the mitotic phase (48Wilkinson C.R. Wallace M. Morphew M. Perry P. Allshire R. Javerzat J.P. McIntosh J.R. Gordon C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6465-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 49Takeda K. Yanagida M. Cell. 2005; 122: 393-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 50Tatebe H. Yanagida M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1329-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The nuclear localization of Asf1-30 and San1 E3 ligase (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 9) suggests that polyubiquitinated Asf1-30 is degraded by the nuclear proteasome. However, the immunofluorescent signal of polyubiquitinated Asf1-30 was observed in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus in the mts2-1 mutant at restrictive temperature (supplemental Fig. S3). These data suggested that polyubiquitinated Asf1-30 is not degraded in the nucleus but instead shunted out of the nucleus for degradation in the cytoplasm.As in S. pombe, the proteasome is enriched inside the nucleus throughout the cell cycle in S. cerevisiae (51Russell S.J. Reed S.H. Huang W. Friedberg E.C. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In contrast to S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, the 26 S proteasome has been found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of higher eukaryotic cells (52Wójcik C. DeMartino G.N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Considering that the nucleus of yeasts is not broken down during cytokinesis, the nuclear localization of the 26 S proteasome is beneficial for the degradation of aberrant proteins generated in the cytoplasm and the nucleus in yeasts.The results presented in this study can be interpreted using the model shown in Fig. 10. At high temperature, the nuclear mutant protein Asf1-30 was selectively polyubiquitinated by the Uba1 E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), Ubc4 E2 (a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), and San1 E3 (ubiquitin ligase) and degraded by the proteasome as a result of protein quality control in S. pombe. The present results suggest that the UPS functions in nuclear protein quality control in S. pombe and that nuclear PQC mediated by San1 and the UPS was evolutionarily conserved from S. cerevisiae to S. pombe. Although there are no apparent san1 orthologs in mammalian cells, analogous systems must exist in higher eukaryotes due to the importance of nuclear PQC in protecting non-dividing cells, such as neural and muscle cells, against the deleterious accumulation of nuclear protein aggregates. In fact, recent studies identified UHRF-2 as an essential E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in nuclear polyglutamine degradation as a component of the nuclear PQC in cultured cells and primary neurons (12Iwata A. Nagashima Y. Matsumoto L. Suzuki T. Yamanaka T. Date H. Deoka K. Nukina N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9796-9803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This result indicates that nuclear PQC plays a key role in neuroprotection against the deleterious accumulation of nuclear protein aggregates in quiescent (G0) mammalian cells.Recent studies have suggested that S. pombe is an excellent model for the study of cellular quiescence, which can be achieved experimentally through nutritional limitation. Studies on the regulatory mechanism of G0 phase in S. pombe showed that the function of the proteasome is required for the maintenance of G0 quiescence (53Takeda K. Yanagida M. Autophagy. 2010; 6: 564-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The proteasome signal persisted in the nuclear periphery in G0 phase in S. pombe, but it diminished with the increase in cytoplasmic localization (53Takeda K. Yanagida M. Autophagy. 2010; 6: 564-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 54Laporte D. Salin B. Daignan-Fornier B. Sagot I. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dysfunction of the proteasome in G0 phase caused the appearance of aberrant nuclear structures (55Takeda K. Yoshida T. Kikuchi S. Nagao K. Kokubu A. Pluskal T. Villar-Briones A. Nakamura T. Yanagida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 3540-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These features of S. pombe could help elucidate the physiological significance of the nuclear PQC in G0 phase, which would lead to a better understanding of the nuclear PQC in G0 phase in higher eukaryotes. In conclusion, nuclear PQC systems are active in budding yeast, fission yeast, and mammals, and they involve different E2s and E3s in each species. IntroductionIn eukaryotic cells, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) 3The abbreviations used are: UPS, ubiquitin-proteasome system; PQC, protein quality control; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ts, temperature-sensitive; Ubi, ubiquitin; CHX, cycloheximide. has a pivotal role in multiple cellular events, including the cell cycle, signal transduction, and receptor-mediated endocytosis (1Hershko A.

The removal of these harmful proteins and the maintenance of homeostasis are accomplished through the selective degradation of aberrant or misfolded proteins by the UPS. The involvement of the UPS in PQC in the cytoplasm and in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have been well studied, and several E3s for PQC have been identified, including Hrd1 and Doa10, which are involved in ER-associated degradation (6Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), as well as CHIP (7Murata S. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Int. J. Biochem.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1106-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), both of which are associated with cytoplasmic PQC.In contrast, the study of nuclear PQC has been very limited to date. The lack of activity of the autophagy-lysosome system in the nucleus (9Iwata A. Christianson J.C. Bucci M. Ellerby L.M. Nukina N. Forno L.S. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13135-13140Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) suggests that nuclear PQC depends entirely on the UPS. Supporting this hypothesis, studies demonstrated that the San1 E3 ligase, which shows specificity for nuclear aberrant proteins, plays a pivotal role in nuclear PQC in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (10Dasgupta A.

Furthermore, recent studies in mammalian cells and primary neurons suggest that the UHRF-2 E3 ligase is an essential molecule for nuclear polyglutamine degradation as a component of the nuclear PQC machinery (12Iwata A.

The high cellular toxicity of aberrant nuclear protein aggregates and their likely association with the neurodegenerative pathology of Huntington disease underscores the importance of investigating the role of nuclear PQC (5Shastry B.S. Neurochem. Int. 2003; 43: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).In the present study, the existence of a nuclear PQC system that functions through the UPS is demonstrated in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. A mutant form of Asf1 (Asf1-30) was used as a substrate for the study of the nuclear PQC system. Asf1 (anti-silencing function 1) was originally identified as a protein whose overexpression inhibits the silencing of chromatin in S. cerevisiae (13Le S. Davis C. Konopka J.B. Sternglanz R. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1029-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and subsequently as a complex with histones H3/H4 that could facilitate the replication-coupled assembly of nucleosomes by CAF1 in vitro (14Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Asf1 is now recognized as a histone chaperone in a wide variety of eukaryotes, including humans (15Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The results of the present study show that Ubc4 (E2) and San1 (E3) are the enzymes catalyzing the degradation of the Asf1-30 mutant protein. This is the first report identifying the molecules responsible for nuclear PQC in S. pombe. In eukaryotic cells, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) 3The abbreviations used are: UPS, ubiquitin-proteasome system; PQC, protein quality control; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ts, temperature-sensitive; Ubi, ubiquitin; CHX, cycloheximide. has a pivotal role in multiple cellular events, including the cell cycle, signal transduction, and receptor-mediated endocytosis (1Hershko A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 788-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar, 3Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). This system is essential for the selective degradation of many cellular proteins. The substrate proteins destined for degradation are first recognized by the ubiquitination machinery, triggering the covalent attachment of a polyubiquitin chain to the target protein. Polyubiquitinated proteins are recognized and degraded by the 26 S proteasome. The formation of the polyubiquitin chain is accomplished by a series of enzymatic reactions catalyzed by three enzymes: an E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), an E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), and an E3 (ubiquitin ligase). The step catalyzed by the E3 is crucial in determining substrate selectivity and timing of degradation, which implies that the identification and understanding of E3s is important to elucidate the mechanisms of specific substrate selection. The UPS also contributes to cellular protein quality control (PQC) (4Goldberg A.L. Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). Aberrant or misfolded proteins are produced in the cell by mutation or environmental stress. The intracellular accumulation of these proteins causes proteotoxic or harmful effects. In humans, for example, the accumulation of aberrant proteins is thought to be associated with diseases such as Alzheimer, Huntington, Parkinson, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases (5Shastry B.S. Neurochem. Int. 2003; 43: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2155790517,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. It is known that overexpression and/or amplification of the MYC oncogene is associated with poor clinical outcome, but the molecular mechanisms and the MYC downstream effectors in MB remain still elusive. Besides contributing to elucidate how progression of MB takes place, most importantly, the identification of novel MYC-target genes will suggest novel candidates for targeted therapy in MB. A group of 209 MYC-responsive genes was obtained from a complementary DNA microarray analysis of a MB-derived cell line, following MYC overexpression and silencing. Among the MYC-responsive genes, we identified the members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, which have a crucial role during the development of the cerebellum. In particular, the gene BMP7 was identified as a direct target of MYC. A positive correlation between MYC and BMP7 expression was documented by analyzing two distinct sets of primary MB samples. Functional studies in vitro using a small-molecule inhibitor of the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway reproduced the effect of the small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of BMP7. Both approaches led to a block of proliferation in a panel of MB cells and to inhibition of SMAD phosphorylation. Altogether, our findings indicate that high MYC levels drive BMP7 overexpression, promoting cell survival in MB cells. This observation suggests the potential relevance of targeting the BMP/SMAD pathway as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of childhood MB."
https://openalex.org/W2039159571,"A detailed study of nuclear import mediated by the HIV-1 Tat peptide (47YGRKKRRQRRR57, TatRRR) is reported. Fluorescence-based measurements, calibration of protein concentrations, and binding assays are exploited to address the physicochemical mechanisms of Tat peptide recognition by the classical importin α (Impα) and importin β (Impβ) receptors both in vitro and in intact cells. We show that TatRRR is an unconventional nuclear localization sequence that binds directly to both Impα and Impβ carriers in the absence of competitors (in vitro), whereas this property is silenced in the actual cellular environment. In the latter case, Impα/β-dependent nuclear import can be successfully restored by replacing the ""RRR"" stretch with ""GGG"". We apply a recently developed method to determine quantitatively TatGGG affinity for each receptor. Based on these results, we can rationalize previous controversial reports on the Tat peptide and provide coherent guidelines for the design of novel intracellular targeting sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2063529252,"Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with many human neoplasms, in which EBV-derived latent membrane protein-1 (LMP1) appears to be critical, but its exact oncogenic mechanism remains to be defined. To this end, our initial microarray analyses identified a LMP1-inducible gene, Ugene, originally characterized as a binding partner for uracil DNA glycosylase 2, which is highly expressed in malignant colon cancer. In this report, it was found that Ugene, designated herein as LMP1-induced protein (LMPIP), was induced, in a time-dependent manner, in EBV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells and LMP1-transfected 293 cells. Functionally, when compared with mock-transfected cells, overexpression of LMPIP in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell lines resulted in a decrease in reactive oxygen species production and maintained mitochondria membrane potential (Δψ) loss induced by H2O2. The NPC cells transfected with LMPIP also showed a decrease in G1 population and an increase in the cell population in sub-G1 and multiploid phase, concomitant with increased levels of cell cycle activators, including cyclin D1 and CDK4. In contrast, silencing of LMPIP expression in the NPC tumor cell lines with short hairpin RNA interference revealed significantly decreased cell population at G1/S phase, while the number of cells in multiploid phase increased. Significantly, NPC cells with LMPIP knock-down also showed a decrease in tumorigenic and transforming activity induced by ectopic LMP1 expression, as determined by analyses of soft agar foci and tumor size in nude mice. Further, elevated LMPIP expression was also noted in cytoplasm and nuclei in EBV-infected NPC tumor cell mass and non-EBV-infected tumor cell lines. These results suggested that LMPIP may have an important mediator role in EBV-mediated neoplasm and may serve as a new target for therapy of tumors induced by EBV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2069760696,"Tropoelastin (TE), the soluble monomer of elastin, is synthesized by elastogenic cells, such as chondrocytes, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). The C-terminal domain of TE interacts with cell receptors, and these interactions play critical roles in elastic fiber assembly. We recently found that oxidation of TE prevents elastic fiber assembly. Here, we examined the effects of oxidation of TE on cell interactions. We found that SMCs bind to TE through heparan sulfate (HS), whereas fetal lung fibroblasts (WI-38 cells) bind through integrin α(v)β(3) and HS. In addition, we found that oxidation of TE by peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) prevented binding of SMCs and WI-38 cells and other elastogenic cells, human dermal fibroblasts and fetal bovine chondrocytes. Because the C-terminal domain of TE has binding sites for both HS and integrin, we examined the effects of oxidation of a synthetic peptide derived from the C-terminal 25 amino acids of TE (CT-25) on cell binding. The CT-25 peptide contains the only two Cys residues in TE juxtaposed to a cluster of positively charged residues (RKRK) that are important for cell binding. ONOO(-) treatment of the CT-25 peptide prevented cell binding, whereas reduction of the CT-25 peptide had no effect. Mass spectrometric and circular dichroism spectroscopic analyses showed that ONOO(-) treatment modified both Cys residues in the CT-25 peptide to sulfonic acid derivatives, without altering the secondary structure. These data suggest that the mechanism by which ONOO(-) prevents cell binding to TE is by introducing negatively charged sulfonic acid residues near the positively charged cluster."
https://openalex.org/W1982843132,"Class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is involved in regulating many cellular functions including cell growth, proliferation, cell survival, and differentiation. The p85 regulatory subunit is a critical component of the PI3K signaling pathway. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are multipotent cells that can be differentiated into osteoblasts (OBs), adipocytes, and chondrocytes under defined culture conditions. To determine whether p85α subunit of PI3K affects biological functions of MSCs, bone marrow-derived wild type (WT) and p85α-deficient (p85α−/−) cells were employed in this study. Increased cell growth, higher proliferation rate and reduced number of senescent cells were observed in MSCs lacking p85α compare with WT MSCs as evaluated by CFU-F assay, thymidine incorporation assay, and β-galactosidase staining, respectively. These functional changes are associated with the increased cell cycle, increased expression of cyclin D, cyclin E, and reduced expression of p16 and p19 in p85α−/− MSCs. In addition, a time-dependent reduction in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteocalcin mRNA expression was observed in p85α−/− MSCs compared with WT MSCs, suggesting impaired osteoblast differentiation due to p85α deficiency in MSCs. The impaired p85α−/− osteoblast differentiation was associated with increased activation of Akt and MAPK. Importantly, bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2) was able to intensify the differentiation of osteoblasts derived from WT MSCs, whereas this process was significantly impaired as a result of p85α deficiency. Addition of LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, did not alter the differentiation of osteoblasts in either genotype. However, application of PD98059, a Mek/MAPK inhibitor, significantly enhanced osteoblast differentiation in WT and p85α−/− MSCs.

Based on primary sequence, substrate preference, and regulation, the PI3K family of lipid kinases can be divided into three major classes (12Engelman J.A. Luo J. Cantley L.C. Nat. Rev.

The class I catalytic subunit polypeptides p110α, p110β, p110δ, and p110γ are encoded by PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3CD, and PIK3CG, respectively (14Cantley L.C.

Engagement of the p85 SH2 domains by pTyr relieves the p85-mediated inhibition of p110 isoforms and also brings them in contact with their lipid substrates in the membrane.

Utilizing mice lacking the expression of class I PI3K regulatory subunit, p85α, we demonstrate that p85α subunit plays a critical role in modulating mesenchymal stem cell functions. p85α−/− mice in a C57BL/6J strain have been described previously (23Munugalavadla V.

The targeting strategy allowed selective disruption of p85α expression while leaving p55α and p50α isoforms intact. These mice were maintained under specific-pathogen-free conditions in the Indiana University Laboratory Animal Research Center, Indianapolis, IN. 6–8-week-old wild type (WT) and p85α−/− mice were used in the study. Anti-p85α antibody, anti-p85β antibody, anti-p110α antibody, and anti-p110β antibody were purchased from Millipore Corp. (Billerica, MA), Anti-phospho-Akt, and anti-phospho-Erk were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Anti-β-actin antibody was purchased from Sigma. BMP2 was purchased from R&D (Minneapolis, MN). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Bone marrow-derived MSCs were generated from 6–8-week old WT and p85α−/− mice as described previously (25Wu M. Wallace M.R. Muir D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2297-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow cells were collected by flushing the femurs and tibias with Iscove's modification of MEM (Invitrogen) containing 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) using a 23-gauge needle. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) were separated by low density gradient centrifugation. Following washing with Iscove's MEM, cells were resuspended and adjusted to a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in mouse MesenCult basal medium supplemented with MesenCult Supplemental (Stem Cell Technologies Inc.). 10 ml of the single cell suspension was added into a 10-cm tissue culture plate as previously described (26Meirelles Lda S. Nardi N.B. Br. J. Haematol. 2003; 123: 702-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Cells were plated into a flask at 2 × 106/ml in 10 ml of complete MesenCult medium. Once the culture reached 80–90% confluence, cells were trypsinized and replated at 5 × 105 cells/75 cm2. MSCs at passage 5 to passage 10 were used in the described experiments. To measure the frequency of MSCs in bone marrow, the CFU-F assay was performed as previously reported with minor modification (26Meirelles Lda S. Nardi N.B. Br. J. Haematol. 2003; 123: 702-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Briefly, BMMNCs were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation from bone marrow cells. 1 × 106/ml BMMNCs were plated into 6-well tissue culture plates in triplicate for each condition in 2 ml of complete MesenCult medium and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. At day 14 of culture, medium was removed from each well followed by two washes of PBS and subsequently stained with HEMA-3 quick staining kit (Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Colonies with more than 50 cells were counted microscopically at 20× magnification by a phase contrast microscope (Nikon, Fryer INC. Chicago, IL). Colonies that morphologically differed from MSCs were excluded from the results. To examine the impact of class I A regulatory subunit p85α on the proliferation of MSCs, [3H]thymidine (New Life Science Products, Inc.) incorporation assay was performed. Briefly, MSCs from WT and p85α−/− mice were deprived of supplement for 24 h and 1 × 104 cells were plated in 96-flat bottom well plates in 200 μl of α-MEM containing 1% glutamine at 37 °C, 5% CO2, humidified incubator. Cells were cultured for 48 h, and [3H]thymidine was added to cultures 6 h prior to harvest on glass fiber filters with an automated cell harvester (96-well harvester, Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) and γ emission was measured with a microplate scintillation counter (Packard Bioscience Company, Shelton, CT). Assays were performed in triplicate for each condition. Cell growth was also evaluated by manually counting cell number with a hemocytometer (27Wu X. Estwick S.A. Chen S. Yu M. Ming W. Nebesio T.D.

Briefly, MSCs were plated into a flask at a concentration of 2 × 106/ml in 10mLs of complete MesenCult medium. Once the culture reached 80–90% confluence, cells were trypsinized and replated at 5 × 105/75 cm2. Cell numbers were then recorded and plated at the same density each time. The fold increase in MSCs was calculated for each time point compared with the first point to generate a growth curve. To investigate if p85α had impact on MSC cell cycle, we conducted flow cytometric analysis and Western blot experiments. MSCs from WT and p85α−/− were plated in 10-cm dishes at 1 × 106 in MSC complete medium and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. Cells were then changed to serum-free medium and cultured for additional 24 h. For flow cytometry analysis, cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 70% ethanol and washed again in cold PBS. Cells were resuspended in 500 μl PI/Triton X-100 staining solution (to 10 ml of 0. 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS add 2 mg of DNase-free RNase A and 0.40 ml of 500 μg/ml PI) and incubated at 37 °C for 15min. Data were acquired on FACS Calibur (BD Biosciencs). For Western blot, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40). Lysates were subjected to immunoblotting to examine expression of CDK2, CDK4, cyclin B, cyclin D, cyclin E, p16, and p19. All the antibodies are from Cell Signaling Technologies Inc. Histochemical staining for β-galactosidase activity was utilized to measure the senescence of MSCs as described previously (27Wu X. Estwick S.A. Chen S. Yu M. Ming W. Nebesio T.D. Li Y. Yuan J. Kapur R. Ingram D. Yoder M.C. Yang F.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2837-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). MSCs from WT and p85α−/− mice were plated in chamber slides (2 × 104 cells/chamber) and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 72 h. Cells were stained with a Senescent Staining kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 6 min with fixation buffer (20% formaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, 70.4 mm Na2HPO4, 14.7 mm KH2PO4, 1.37 m NaCl, and 26.8 mm KCl). After 3 washes with PBS, labeling reagents were added into the chamber, and stained at 37 °C without CO2 overnight. Senescent cells displayed a blue color in the cytoplasm. Four thousand cells were counted for each chamber and the percentage of positive cells/4000 cells was determined. To induce osteogenic differentiation, WT, and p85α−/− MSCs were plated at 5 × 104/ml in osteogenic differentiation medium (MesenCult proliferation kit supplemented with 10−8 mol/liter dexamethasone, 5 μg/ml ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, and 10mmol/liter β-glycerophosphate) in 12-well plate. For Von Kossa staining, cells were cultured for 2 weeks; for ALP activity assay, cells were maintained in osteogenic differentiation medium for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days. The medium was changed every other day. Von Kossa staining was conducted by fixing cells in 10% buffered formalin for 15 min, washing cells in water, staining cells in 5% silver nitrate under UV for 1 h. For ALP staining, cells were fixed in citrate-buffered acetone for 30 s, incubated in alkaline-dye mix for 30 min, and counterstained with Mayer's Hematoxylin for 10 min. Cells were then evaluated microscopically, and the intensity of ALP staining was recorded. To induce chondrogenic differentiation, WT and p85α−/− MSCs were maintained in chondrogenic differentiation medium (MesenCult proliferation kit supplemented with 10−8 mol/liter dexamethasone, 5 μg/ml ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, 10 mmol/liter β-glycerophosphate, and 10 ng/ml TGFβ3) for 2 weeks. The medium was changed every other day. Cells were then fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 30 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and incubated with 1% Alcian Blue in 0.1 m HCl (pH 1.0). Chondrogenic cells were visualized as blue-stained cells under the microscope. To induce adipogenic differentiation, WT and p85α−/− MSCs were maintained in adipogenic differentiation medium (MesenCult proliferation kit supplemented with 10−8 mol/liter dexamethasone and 10 μg/ml of insulin) for 2 weeks. The medium was changed once a week. Cells were then fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 30 min at room temperature, washed with PBS and incubated with 2% Oil Red O for 1 h. Cells were washed with ddH2O. Adipogenic cells were visualized as red-stained lipid droplets under the microscope. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to examine the expression of osteoblast differentiation markers. Following incubation in differentiation medium for 1, 3, or 7 days, total RNA was extracted by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and 100 ng of RNA was used for each RT-PCR reaction. RT-PCR was performed using Qiagen one step RT-PCR kit according to the manufacturer's instruction at week 1 and week 4. The primers used were GCAAGGTTCAACGATCTGAG, GTAATCTGACTCTGTCCTTGTG 298 bp for RUNX2; GTAGCCATCCAGGCTGTGTTGTC, ACAGCACTGTGTTGGCATAGAGG for β-actin; TCACCATTCGGATGAGTCTG, ACTTGTGGCTCTGATGTTCC 437 bp for osteopontin (28Chackalaparampil I. Peri A. Nemir M. McKee M.D. Lin P.H. Mukherjee B.B. Mukherjee A.B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1457-1467PubMed Google Scholar); AGCGCCTGGAGGCTGGAGAC, CTTGATGCCAAAGCAGCCGG 269 bp for osteonectin; and TCTGCTCACTCTGCTGAC, GGAGCTGCTGTGACATCC 388 bp for osteocalcin (29Windahl S.H. Vidal O. Andersson G. Gustafsson J.A. Ohlsson C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). All the primers were synthesized by Sigma. WT and p85α−/− MSCs were plated in 10-cm dishes at 1 × 106 in MSC complete medium. After incubating for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, cells were depleted with serum for 24 h followed by BMP2 (10 ng/ml) or DMSO stimulation for 10 min. Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40). Lysates were subjected to immunoblotting to examine phosphorylation of Akt and Erk. One way ANOVA and t test were used to evaluate statistical differences between WT and p85α−/− MSCs. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. p85α has been shown to regulate cell proliferation in multiple cell lineages (17Vanhaesebroeck B. Ali K. Bilancio A. Geering B. Foukas L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 194-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), including in hematopoietic cells (12Engelman J.A. Luo J. Cantley L.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 606-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether or not p85α impacts MSC proliferation. In the present study, we performed a series of functional assays to evaluate the role of p85α in regulating MSC proliferation. The number of MSCs were scored by counting viable WT and p85α−/− MSCs over a span of 10 continuous passages and the number of MSCs from each passage was recorded, and a growth curve was generated (Fig. 2A). While WT and p85α−/− MSCs grew slowly during early passages; a steady increase in the number of MSCs was observed over 10 passages in both the genotypes. This is consistent with studies by our group and others (27Wu X. Estwick S.A. Chen S. Yu M. Ming W. Nebesio T.D. Li Y. Yuan J. Kapur R. Ingram D. Yoder M.C. Yang F.C. Hum. Mol.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3035-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) and after passage 3, p85α−/− MSCs demonstrated faster cell growth compared with WT MSCs at each time point examined (Fig. 2A). This high rate of growth due to p85α deficiency was maintained at later passages as well. Similar findings were observed using a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that p85α is a negative regulator of MSC proliferation. To measure the frequency of the MSC progenitors in the bone marrow of p85α−/− mice in vivo, we performed a CFU-F assay. A significant increase in the frequency and total number of CFU-F/femur was observed in p85α−/− mice compared with WT controls (Fig. 2, C and D). In addition, the average size of CFU-F in p85α−/− cultures was significantly larger than that in WT cultures (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that deletion of p85α results in increased proliferation of MSCs in vitro and frequency of CFU-F in vivo. Flow cytometry is a simple and reliable method to evaluate cell cycle changes. In this study, we found that p85a−/− MSCs have less frequency in G1 phase (Fig. 3A). In contrast, increased percentages of G2 and S phases were observed in p85a−/− MSCs (Fig. 3A). This result is in line with the finding above that p85α−/− MSCs are more proliferative than WT MSCs. Further study by Western blot showed that p85α−/− MSCs have much lower expression of p16 and p19 but higher expression of cyclin D and cyclin E. These results suggest that deletion of p85α promotes MSCs exiting from G1 phase and entering into G2-S phase, that is, entrance of cell cycle (Fig. 3D). Senescence is associated with reduction in proliferative capacity that is refractory to mitogenic stimulation and the appearance of senescence-related β-galactosidase activity (27Wu X. Estwick S.A. Chen S. Yu M. Ming W. Nebesio T.D. Li Y. Yuan J. Kapur R. Ingram D. Yoder M.C. Yang F.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2837-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Long-term in vitro culture of mesenchymal stem cells exhibit reduced proliferation rate, which is associated with replicative senescence (32Kassem M. Ankersen L. Eriksen E.F. Clark B.F. Rattan S.I. Osteoporos. Int. 1997; 7: 514-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 33Digirolamo C.M. Stokes D. Colter D. Phinney D.G. Class R. Prockop D.J. Br. J.

Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (17647) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism that regulates MSC senescence is not well understood. To test whether the increased proliferation in p85α−/− MSCs is associated with a change in cellular senescence, a senescent assay was performed based upon histochemical staining for β-galactosidase activity. A significant reduction in the number of β-galactosidase-positive cells was observed in p85α−/− MSCs compared with WT MSCs (Fig. 3B). The quantitative results indicate that nearly 50% of WT MSCs were senescent and β-galactosidase positive. In contrast, only 10% β-galactosidase-positive senescent cells were observed in p85α−/− cultures (Fig. 3C). More importantly, as stated above, the two closely related to senescent regulation proteins, p16 and p19 are down-regulated by deletion of p85α (Fig. 3D). These data are consistent with the reduced senescent cells in p85α−/− culture. Collectively, these results suggest that the increased proliferation in MSCs lacking p85α is associated with a decrease in relative senescent activity compared with WT controls. These data suggest that deletion of p85α down-regulates MSC senescent, possibly through down-regulation of p16 and p19 expression, leading to increased MSC proliferation. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3E, deletion of p85α is accompanied by decreased expression of PARP, a substrate of caspase 3 that has been reported to be associated with apoptosis (36Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar, 37Nicholson D.W.

MSCs have multipotent differentiation capacity. In this study, we utilized a genetic murine model that has deletion in the class I A PI3K regulatory subunit, p85α, to evaluate the role of the PI3K pathway in modulating multi-lineage differentiation from MSCs. Deletion of p85α resulted in reduced mineralization of osteoblast as examined by Von Kossa staining (Fig. 4A, left panels). Deletion of p85a had no effect on chondrocyte differentiation as determined by Alcian Blue staining (Fig. 4A, middle panels), while an increased adipocyte differentiation was observed in p85a−/− cultures as determined by Oil Red O staining (Fig. 4A, right panels). MSCs are a source of osteoblasts which take part in bone formation. Although many factors have been implicated in regulating osteoblast differentiation and later bone formation (38Kratchmarova I. Blagoev B. Haack-Sorensen M. Kassem M. Mann M. Science. 2005; 308: 1472-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 39Rifas L. J. Cell.

J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33132-33140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms underlying MSC differentiation into osteoblasts largely remains unclear. To further investigate the role of p85α in regulating osteoblast differentiation, osteoblasts were induced from the MSC cultures under defined conditions in vitro as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following sequential culture, WT MSCs displayed moderate ALP activity at 24 h (Fig. 4B). On day 3, WT MSCs showed strong ALP activity which peaked on day 7. In contrast, minimum ALP positive cells were observed in p85α−/− cultures at 24 h (Fig. 4A). Although ALP activity increased over time in p85α−/− MSCs, the intensity of ALP staining was significantly less than that of WT cultures at every time point examined (Fig. 4B). Quantification of ALP activity demonstrated a significant difference between WT and p85α−/− MSCs (Fig. 4C). To confirm the role of p85α in impaired osteoblast differentiation from MSCs, expression of osteogenic specific genes, including osteocalcin, osteopontin, osteonectin, and RUNX2 was examined in WT and p85α−/− MSCs (Fig. 5A). Osteocalcin mRNA expression was increased over time from day1 to day 7 in WT MSC cultures (Fig. 5A). In contrast, minimum osteocalcin mRNA expression was detected in p85α−/− cells at days 1 and 3 of culture and significantly reduced osteocalcin levels were observed in p85α−/− cultures compared with controls on day 7."

Notch ligand Dll1 (Delta-like 1) stimulation induces MHC class II expression in mast cells and renders them as antigen-presenting cells. However, nothing is known about the mechanism by which Notch signaling induces MHC class II expression in mast cells. MHC class II genes are regulated by the class II transactivator (CIITA). In mice, transcription of the CIITA gene is controlled by three cell type-specific promoters (pI, pIII, and pIV). Here, we show that CIITA expression induced by Dll1 stimulation in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) depends critically on the signal mediated by Notch1 and that the most dominant promoter in Notch signaling-mediated CIITA expression in BMMCs is pIII, which is a lymphoid lineage-specific promoter. ChIP assays indicated that Notch signaling increased the binding of the transcription factor PU.1 to CIITA pIII in BMMCs. The knockdown of PU.1 expression using a specific siRNA suppressed Notch signaling-mediated CIITA expression, suggesting that PU.1 contributes to the expression of MHC class II induced by Notch signaling in mast cells. Furthermore, we show that a portion of freshly isolated splenic mast cells express MHC class II and that the most dominant promoter of CIITA in mast cells is pIII.

https://openalex.org/W2051351327,"The expression levels of caspase-8 inhibitory c-FLIP proteins play an important role in regulating death receptor-mediated apoptosis, as their concentration at the moment when the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) is formed determines the outcome of the DISC signal. Experimental studies have shown that c-FLIP proteins are subject to dynamic turnover and that their stability and expression levels can be rapidly altered. Even though the influence of c-FLIP on the apoptotic behavior of a single cell has been captured in mathematical simulation studies, the effect of c-FLIP turnover and stability has not been investigated. In this study, a mathematical model of apoptosis was developed to analyze how the dynamic turnover and stability of the c-FLIP isoforms regulate apoptotic signaling for both individual cells and cell populations. Intercellular parameter and concentration distributions were used to describe the behavior of cell populations. Monte-Carlo simulations of cell populations showed that c-FLIP turnover is a key determinant of death receptor responses. The fact that the developed model simulates the state of whole cell populations makes it possible to validate it by comparison with empirical data. The proposed modeling approach can be used to further determine limiting factors in the DISC signaling process."
https://openalex.org/W1967433179,"E4orf6 is one of the oncogene products of adenovirus, and it also has an important role for transportation of cellular and viral messenger RNA (mRNA) during the late phase of virus infection. We previously revealed that E4orf6 controls the fate of AU-rich element (ARE) containing mRNA by perturbing the chromosome maintenance region 1-dependent export mechanism. Here, we show that E4orf6 stabilizes ARE–mRNA through the region required for its oncogenic activity and ubiquitin E3 ligase assembly. Cells that failed to stabilize ARE–mRNA after HuR knockdown were unable to produce colonies in soft agar, even when E4orf6 was expressed. Furthermore, the stabilized ARE–mRNA induced the transformation of rodent immortalized cells. These findings indicate that stabilized ARE–mRNA is necessary, if not all, for the oncogenic activity of E4orf6 and has the potential to transform cells, at least under a certain condition."
