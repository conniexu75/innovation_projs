Using genetically targeted viral tracing and whole-brain anatomical analysis, we identify over 40 SNr targets that encompass a roughly 50-fold range of axonal densities. Retrograde tracing from the volumetrically largest targets indicates that the SNr contains segregated subpopulations that differentially project to functionally distinct brain stem regions. These subpopulations are electrophysiologically specialized and topographically organized and collateralize to common diencephalon targets, including the motor and intralaminar thalamus as well as the pedunculopontine nucleus and the midbrain reticular formation.

Motor actions are the consequence of neuronal computations in circuits that are distributed broadly across the nervous system (Grillner, 2006Grillner S.

Individual components of the motor system have been studied extensively, with prominent attention given to the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. These studies have yielded deep insights into local signaling within each structure (Klaus et al., 2019Klaus A. Alves da Silva J. Costa R.M.

However, the organization and circuit mechanisms that connect nodes of the motor system to each other remain largely unknown. Here we investigate the circuit basis by which outputs of the basal ganglia impinge on the broader motor system. Basal ganglia form an essential component of the volitional motor system and mediate fundamental aspects of behavioral regulation and learning (Alexander et al., 1990Alexander G.E. Crutcher M.D. DeLong M.R. Basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits: parallel substrates for motor, oculomotor, “prefrontal” and “limbic” functions.Prog.

Disruption of the basal ganglia network underlies common movement disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and Tourette syndrome (Mink, 2001Mink J.W.

Moreover, basal ganglia dysfunction has also been implicated in cognitive and affective control. Neurons in the volumetrically largest output nucleus of the basal ganglia, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), emit well-established projections to the superior colliculus, motor and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, and the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) (Alexander et al., 1990Alexander G.E.

The lack of systematic circuit mapping has hindered comprehensive identification of SNr target regions, and it remains unknown whether the SNr contains distinct classes of projection neurons. To delineate the circuit logic of basal ganglia output signaling and projection cell types in the SNr, we first address the mesoscopic organization of SNr projections and determine the electrophysiological properties of SNr neurons. (1) Which brain regions are the major targets of SNr axonal projections? (2) Do different electrophysiological properties of SNr cells correspond to distinct output populations? (3) Do neurons in the SNr project equally to all major targets, as expected for a global hub-like architecture (Figure 1A), or does the SNr contain segregated projection populations that project preferentially to different targets (Figure 1B)? To address these questions, we combine state-of-the-art viral circuit mapping; high-resolution, whole-brain optical scanning; and electrophysiological recordings of identified projection neurons. To identify the brain regions targeted by basal ganglia outputs, we mapped SNr axonal projections and synaptic terminals across the brain using genetically restricted viral tracing. The predominant population of neurons in the SNr is parvalbumin-positive GABAergic neurons (González-Hernández and Rodríguez, 2000González-Hernández T. Rodríguez M. Compartmental organization and chemical profile of dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 421: 107-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We verified that 86.9% ± 1.0% of GABAergic SNr neurons express parvalbumin (14,901 neurons, 39 sections, 4 mice) (Figures 1C and S1A–S1C) throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the nucleus (Figure S1B). To label the axons and presynaptic boutons arising from this population, membrane-bound green fluorescent protein (mGFP) and synaptophysin-mRuby were expressed virally (AAV-DJ-hSyn-FLEX-mGFP-2A-synaptophysin-mRuby) in SNr neurons in parvalbumin-Cre (PV-Cre) mice (Figure 1D). High-resolution, whole-brain slide scanning of SNr projections reveals axon terminations that extend over 7 mm, from the anterior thalamus to the caudal brain stem (Figures 1E–1L). In the diencephalon, SNr targets include major motor (ventromedial [VM] and ventroanterior [VA]) and intralaminar/midline (mediodorsal [MD], centro-lateral/medial [CL/CM], and parafascicular [Pf]) thalamic nuclei (Figures 1E–1G), as in other species (Cebrián et al., 2005Cebrián C.

A greater number of targets are observed in the brain stem. Beyond well-established projections to the superior colliculus and PPN (Hikosaka, 2007bHikosaka O. GABAergic output of the basal ganglia.Prog. Brain Res. 2007; 160: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar; Figures 1H and 1I), extensive SNr projections target volumetrically large domains of the midbrain reticular formation (MidRF), pontine reticular formation (PNo), and medullary reticular formation (Med; subdivisions parvicellular [PcRT] and intermediate [IRT]) as well as 17 small premotor nuclei (Figures 1H–1K, S2H–S2K, and S3). Downstream brain stem targets span regions that have been implicated in oculomotor and head orientation (superior colliculus, INC/MA3/Su3; Fukushima, 1987Fukushima K.

We identified significant SNr projections to 42 distinct regions (Figure 2A). GABAergic neurons throughout the extent of SNr express parvalbumin, encoded by the gene Pvalb (Figures 1C and S1), and GAD2 mRNA (Figure S1C), with large neurons in the dorsolateral SNr highly expressing parvalbumin and smaller neurons in the VM SNr expressing lower levels (Figure S1A; González-Hernández et al., 2001González-Hernández T. Barroso-Chinea P. Acevedo A. Salido E. Rodríguez M. Colocalization of tyrosine hydroxylase and GAD65 mRNA in mesostriatal neurons.Eur. J.

Compartmental organization and chemical profile of dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 421: 107-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the smaller percentage of parvalbumin-negative SNr GABAergic neurons project to distinct downstream targets, we performed additional axonal tracing from the SNr in VGAT-Cre mice (Figures S2 and S3). Whole-brain analysis revealed a comparable projection pattern from the SNr in VGAT-Cre and PV-Cre mice (Figures S2L and S2M). Across the 42 downstream targets of the SNr in the diencephalon and brain stem, the density of SNr bouton innervation spans a continuous range over more than one and a half orders of magnitude (Figure 2A, left). When we account for the volume of downstream structures (Figure 2A, center), the total SNr bouton output is enriched in a limited set of structures, including the VM thalamus, PPN, and dorsal zona incerta—6.1%, 5.8%, and 4.6% of the total SNr output, respectively. Nearly two-thirds of the output from the SNr targets the brain stem reticular formations and the colliculi (33.9% across the MidRF, PNo, and PcRT/IRT and 30.9% across the central superior colliculus [CSC], lateral superior colliculus [LSC], medial superior colliculus [MSC], and inferior colliculus [IC]), whereas the remaining 32 structures each receive less than 2% of the total bouton output (Figures 2A, right, and 2D). A quantitative analysis shows that the probability density function for the axonal density is roughly exponentially distributed across the major fraction of SNr targets until a plateau is reached (black scale, Figure 2B). The plateau corresponds to innervation of the densest targets. These targets comprise the well-established SNr targets (i.e., the VA and VM motor thalamus, PPN, and superior colliculus; Figures 2B and 2C); however, the vast majority of total SNr output spans areas outside of these targets (Figure 2D). The SNr targets an expansive and diverse set of anatomical substrates (Figures 2A, S2, and S3) through a continuum of dense-to-sparse projections (Figures 2A–2C). The major fraction of total output is concentrated in several large brain stem regions and, to a lesser extent, the zona incerta and motor thalamus (Figure 2D). Do SNr neurons have diverse intrinsic electrophysiological properties? The spiking responses of SNr neurons during behavior include increases and decreases in rate across broad ranges and variable durations (Gulley et al., 1999Gulley J.M. Kuwajima M. Mayhill E.

Start/stop signals emerge in nigrostriatal circuits during sequence learning.Nature. 2010; 466: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether this heterogeneity arises from different synaptic inputs through afferents or network interactions or a spectrum of electrophysiological properties intrinsic to SNr neurons. To assess the firing properties across SNr neurons, we first performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from SNr neurons in young adult mouse midbrain slices. Across the population, neurons (120 cells from 14 mice) exhibited a capacity for highly regular and tonic firing (Atherton and Bevan, 2005Atherton J.F. Bevan M.D. Ionic mechanisms underlying autonomous action potential generation in the somata and dendrites of GABAergic substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons in vitro.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8272-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A), rapid action potential kinetics (Figure 3B), and sustained, high-rate activity (Figure 3C). Most critical, SNr firing responses to depolarizing inputs are highly linear (R2 = 0.99 ± 0.01) (Figure 3C). The limited adaptation and linearity of the neuronal input-output relation is consistent with open-loop drive for a motor system (Åström and Murray, 2008Åström K.J. Murray R.M. Feedback systems: an introduction for scientists and engineers. Princeton University Press, 2008Crossref Google Scholar), akin to linear neuronal and synaptic properties common in brain stem sensorimotor networks (Kolkman et al., 2011Kolkman K.E.

In contrast, responses to hyperpolarizing inputs are non-linear, and the capacity for post-inhibitory rebound firing varied significantly across the population (Figure 3D). The broad continuum found for each electrophysiological property (e.g., gain, firing rate ranges, and rebound kinetics) can differentially tune the firing capabilities of individual neurons in the SNr. We next ascertained how the remarkable diversity of SNr cellular properties maps onto specific anatomical projection targets. The large brain stem targets of the SNr have been implicated in disparate behavioral functions, involving distinct body parts and muscle groups. Do distinct SNr neuron pools that project to different downstream effector regions have specialized electrophysiological properties? To test this possibility, we first injected each of the large brainstem regions (Figure 2A, center) with a fluorescent retrograde tracer and targeted whole-cell recordings to labeled projection neurons (Figure 4A). In the hindbrain, the large SNr targets are the Med (i.e., subdivisions PcRT/IRT), PNo, and DR (Figures 1I–1K). Large midbrain targets of the SNr are the IC and superior colliculus (SC) (Figure 1H). Three medial-lateral domains of the SC were treated separately in light of the spatial specificity of their visual and somatosensory inputs (Comoli et al., 2012Comoli E. Das Neves Favaro P.

We find that SNr neurons projecting to different large brain stem regions exhibit notable electrophysiological specializations (4–7 mice per target; see Figure S5 for injection parameters). Projections to the colliculi arise from neuronal pools with different signaling capabilities. Neurons that project to the LSC and CSC have a relatively rapid rise and fall of their action potential, as seen by plotting its derivative, dV/dt, versus the amplitude of the transmembrane potential, V (Figure 4B, left blue and green curves), and high spontaneous and maximum firing ranges (Figures 4C and 4D). In contrast, projections to the MSC and IC arise from relatively slower neuronal pools (Figures 4B–4D). SNr projections to hindbrain targets exhibit electrophysiological differences such that projections to the PNo and Med exhibit a rapid rise and fall to their action potential and high spike rates (Figures 4B–4D). In contrast, neurons projecting to the DR exhibit slow action potentials, low firing rates, and long time constants and comprise the slowest projection population in the SNr (Figures 4B–4D). Rather than spanning the full diversity in the SNr, the intrinsic parameters of each of these projection populations span a restricted range (Figures 4D, S5C, and S6). This shows that different projection populations have specific functional properties. Neurons in the SNr that project to brain stem areas span a range of post-inhibitory rebound firing capabilities. Robust non-linear rebound firing responses to hyperpolarization are greatest in neurons projecting to the Med and IC, which exhibited bursting up to hundreds of spikes per second and averaged 69 ± 15 Hz and 58 ± 11 Hz, respectively (Figure 4E). In contrast, transient and sustained rebound firing of other projection populations is modest, and neurons projecting to the DR exhibit the lowest capacity for rebound (Figures 4E). Thus, rather than each projection population spanning the full continuum of electrophysiological properties, projections to large brain stem areas arise from subpopulations of SNr neurons whose properties are tuned differentially. SNr-brain stem projection neurons cluster spatially in the SNr (Figure 4F) and form a spatial continuum of electrophysiological properties (Figure S6C). Projection neurons that exhibit slower active and passive properties are concentrated in the medial portion of the nucleus (Figure S6C), which overlaps with terminal fields from associative striatal regions.

https://openalex.org/W3139664288,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most fatal malignancies and rapidly progressive diseases. Exosomes and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as vital mediators in tumor cells and their microenvironment. However, the detailed roles and mechanisms of exosomal lncRNAs in PDAC progression remain unknown. Here, we aimed to clarify the clinical significance and mechanisms of exosomal lncRNA 01133 (LINC01133) in PDAC. We analyzed the expression of LINC01133 in PDAC and found that exosomal LINC01133 expression was high and positively correlated with higher TNM stage and poor overall survival rate of PDAC patients. Further research demonstrated that Periostin could increase exosome secretion and then enhance LINC01133 expression. In addition, Periostin increased p-EGFR, p-Erk, and c-myc expression, and c-myc could bind to the LINC01133 promoter region. These findings suggested that LINC01133 can be regulated by Periostin via EGFR pathway activity. We also observed that LINC01133 promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of pancreatic cancer cells. We subsequently evaluated the effect of LINC01133 on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and confirmed that LINC01133 can interact with Enhancer Of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) and then promote H3K27 trimethylation. This can further silence AXIN2 and suppress GSK3 activity, ultimately activating β-catenin. Collectively, these data indicate that exosomal LINC01133 plays an important role in pancreatic tumor progression, and targeting LINC01133 may provide a potential treatment strategy for PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W3147142527,"Deletion of SCN9A encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 in humans leads to profound pain insensitivity and anosmia. Conditional deletion of NaV1.7 in sensory neurons of mice also abolishes pain, suggesting that the locus of analgesia is the nociceptor. Here we demonstrate, using in vivo calcium imaging and extracellular recording, that NaV1.7 knockout mice have essentially normal nociceptor activity. However, synaptic transmission from nociceptor central terminals in the spinal cord is greatly reduced by an opioid-dependent mechanism. Analgesia is also reversed substantially by central but not peripheral application of opioid antagonists. In contrast, the lack of neurotransmitter release from olfactory sensory neurons is opioid independent. Male and female humans with NaV1.7-null mutations show naloxone-reversible analgesia. Thus, inhibition of neurotransmitter release is the principal mechanism of anosmia and analgesia in mouse and human Nav1.7-null mutants."
https://openalex.org/W3149228057,"TREM2 is a pattern recognition receptor, expressed on microglia and myeloid cells, detecting lipids and Aβ and inducing an innate immune response. Missense mutations (e.g., R47H) of TREM2 increase risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The soluble ectodomain of wild-type TREM2 (sTREM2) has been shown to protect against AD in vivo, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We show that Aβ oligomers bind to cellular TREM2, inducing shedding of the sTREM2 domain. Wild-type sTREM2 bound to Aβ oligomers (measured by single-molecule imaging, dot blots, and Bio-Layer Interferometry) inhibited Aβ oligomerization and disaggregated preformed Aβ oligomers and protofibrils (measured by transmission electron microscopy, dot blots, and size-exclusion chromatography). Wild-type sTREM2 also inhibited Aβ fibrillization (measured by imaging and thioflavin T fluorescence) and blocked Aβ-induced neurotoxicity (measured by permeabilization of artificial membranes and by loss of neurons in primary neuronal–glial cocultures). In contrast, the R47H AD-risk variant of sTREM2 is less able to bind and disaggregate oligomeric Aβ but rather promotes Aβ protofibril formation and neurotoxicity. Thus, in addition to inducing an immune response, wild-type TREM2 may protect against amyloid pathology by the Aβ-induced release of sTREM2, which blocks Aβ aggregation and neurotoxicity. In contrast, R47H sTREM2 promotes Aβ aggregation into protofibril that may be toxic to neurons. These findings may explain how wild-type sTREM2 apparently protects against AD in vivo and why a single copy of the R47H variant gene is associated with increased AD risk.

A prominent neuropathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the presence of extracellular deposits of the amyloid β-peptide in amyloid plaques, surrounded by activated microglia (1Wong C.W.

The importance of this microglial response to the pathogenesis of AD has been highlighted by the recent discovery of sequence variants in multiple genes expressed in microglia that alter risk for AD.

Full-length TREM2 is expressed on the plasma membrane of microglia, where it can be cleaved by one or more metalloproteases to produce (i) a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (CTF); and (ii) an N-terminal fragment consisting of the soluble ectodomain of TREM2 (sTREM2), which is released into the extracellular space (7Wunderlich P.

Sixth, healthy controls and MCI patients with higher sTREM2 levels in CSF have slower progression of amyloid and tau deposition (22Ewers M. Biechele G. Suárez-Calvet M. Sacher C. Blume T.

Med. 2020; 12: e12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), consistent with sTREM2 inhibiting Aβ aggregation and subsequent tau pathology. All of these in vivo findings are compatible with the hypothesis that sTREM2 might protect against AD, potentially by impacting Aβ aggregation. To explore this hypothesis and the mechanisms involved, we investigated the interaction of Aβ with sTREM2 in vitro. We report that soluble Aβ oligomers bind TREM2 receptor on microglia and induce shedding of sTREM2. Next, we show that sTREM2 can bind and disaggregate Aβ oligomers, block Aβ fibrillization, and reduce Aβ neurotoxicity. These activities are attenuated in the R47H TREM2 holoprotein and R47H sTREM2. Moreover, the R47H sTREM2 promotes formation of morphologically distinct Aβ protofibrils. These data indicate additional mechanisms by which TREM2 protects against Alzheimer's disease and a previously unrecognized mechanism by which the R47H mutant increases risk. To confirm that TREM2 can act as a cell surface receptor for Aβ oligomers, we treated mouse primary microglia or TREM2-transfected HeLa cells with Aβ42 oligomers that have been characterized both by electron microscopy and by oligomer/fibril specific antibodies (Fig. S1; note only Aβ42 was used in this work and will be referred to as Aβ henceforth). We then immunoprecipitated TREM2 from lysates of these cells and found that Aβ co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous TREM2 on primary microglia from wild-type mice, but not on microglia from TREM2−/− knockout mice (Fig. S2i). The Aβ binding was prevented by TREM2-blocking antibody (Fig. S2ii). Oligomeric Aβ bound to TREM2 but not TREM1 (Fig. S2iii). Monomeric Aβ co-immunoprecipitated with TREM2 less efficiently than oligomeric Aβ (Fig. S2, iv and v, p = 0.03). The TREM2: Aβ oligomer interaction is at least partially specific because neither of two other neurodegeneration-associated oligomeric proteins (oligomeric α-synuclein or oligomeric Tau) bound to TREM2 even in HeLa cells overexpressing TREM2 and DAP12 (Fig. S3). These results confirm and extend the work of other groups showing that oligomeric Aβ binds TREM2 (13Zhao Y. Wu X. Li X. Jiang L.L. Gui X. Liu Y. Sun Y. Zhu B. Piña-Crespo J.C. Zhang M. Zhang N.

We next tested the consequences of Aβ oligomers binding to TREM2 on primary microglia. Aβ oligomers induced release of sTREM2 into the medium of primary microglia from wild-type mice, but not microglia from mice engineered to express R47H TREM2 (Fig. S4i, p < 0.05). To study this effect in more detail, we stably expressed human TREM2 (together with human DAP12) in HEK293 cells. Treatment of these cells with Aβ oligomers resulted in dose-dependent release of sTREM2 into the medium and the accumulation of TREM2-CTF in cell lysates (Fig. 1, A and B & Fig. S4ii). In contrast, treatment with Aβ monomers or fibrils resulted in no modulation of sTREM2's release (Figs. 1C and S5). We have previously shown that this shedding event occurs rapidly, within 1 h of Aβ oligomer binding, but that FL-TREM2 levels remain constant due to ongoing new synthesis of FL-TREM2 (8Thornton P. Sevalle J. Deery M.J. Fraser G. Zhou Y. Ståhl S. Franssen E.H. Dodd R.B. Qamar S. Gomez Perez-Nievas B. Nicol L.S. Eketjäll S. Revell J. Jones C.

Thus, oligomeric Aβ stimulates release of sTREM2 (potentially by endoproteolysis) from cells expressing wild-type TREM2, but less so from cells expressing R47H TREM2. Because Aβ oligomers bind to TREM2 and induce shedding of sTREM2, it is of interest whether sTREM2 itself binds Aβ oligomers. Three groups reported that wild-type sTREM2 fused to the Fc domain of IgG binds oligomeric Aβ (13Zhao Y. Wu X. Li X. Jiang L.L. Gui X. Liu Y. Sun Y. Zhu B. Piña-Crespo J.C. Zhang M. Zhang N. Chen X.

Med. 2018; 10e9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) found that they bound equally. We applied three orthogonal assays using an approach that did not require fusion of sTREM2 to the Fc domain of IgG, to reassess this question. Firstly, we examined this interaction at the molecular level using single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy-based two-color coincidence detection (23Horrocks M.H. Lee S.F. Gandhi S. Magdalinou N.K. Chen S.W. Devine M.J. Tosatto L. Kjaergaard M. Beckwith J.S. Zetterberg H. Iljina M. Cremades N. Dobson C.M. Wood N.W. Klenerman D. Single-molecule imaging of individual amyloid protein aggregates in human biofluids.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2016; 7: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). HiLyte 488-dye labeled Aβ was oligomerized and TAMRA-dye labeled sTREM2 added and imaged. Monomeric Aβ bleaches rapidly, so colocalization of Aβ and sTREM2 before and after bleaching enabled us to distinguish between monomers and oligomers. These experiments revealed that wild-type sTREM2 bound oligomeric Aβ much more than monomeric Aβ (Fig. 1, D and E) and that R47H sTREM2 bound less well to oligomeric Aβ than wild-type sTREM2 did (Fig. 1F). Second, this result was confirmed by a semiquantitative dot blot assay, which showed that wild-type sTREM2 preferentially bound oligomeric Aβ over monomeric Aβ and that R47H sTREM2 bound less of both forms of Aβ (Fig. S6, i and ii). Third, we used Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) (24Concepcion J. Witte K. Wartchow C. Choo S. Yao D. Persson H. Wei J. Li P. Heidecker B. Ma W. Varma R. Zhao L.S. Perillat D. Carricato G. Recknor M. et al.Label-free detection of biomolecular interactions using Bio-Layer Interferometry for kinetic characterization.Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2009; 12: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) to quantitatively assess the Aβ oligomer: sTREM2 interaction by immobilizing biotin-Aβ oligomers on Streptavidin biosensors and then exposing them to sTREM2. These studies suggested that sTREM2 associated with Aβ oligomers with two different rates and dissociated from Aβ oligomers with two different rates (Fig. S6, iii and iv), consistent with sTREM2 binding to different Aβ oligomer sizes with different affinities. Best fit association and dissociation curves for both wild-type and R47H sTREM2 were with a 2:1 heterogeneous ligand model. In agreement with the semiquantitative experiments described above, these BLI studies confirmed that R47H sTREM2 bound Aβ oligomers less well than wild-type sTREM2 (Table S1: TREM2 WT KD1 = 2.00 ± 0.15 μM, KD2 = 0.29 ± 0.08 μM; TREM2 R47H mutant KD1 = 11.70 ± 5.97 μM, KD2 = 1.22 ± 0.30 μM; where KD1 is the dissociation constant of the predominant interaction within the heterogeneous population of Aβ species). Because sTREM2 bound to Aβ oligomers, we next investigated whether sTREM2 affected Aβ oligomerization. We incubated 22 μM monomeric Aβ ± 0.22 or 0.44 μM sTREM2 (wild-type or R47H) for 3 h at 37 °C, i.e., conditions known to generate Aβ oligomers. The formation of Aβ oligomers was then assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figs. 2 and S7); dot blotting with A11 antioligomer antibody; and by high-performance liquid chromatography size-exclusion chromatography (HPLC-SEC) experiments (Fig. S8). These experiments revealed that preincubation of Aβ monomers with wild-type sTREM2 (at molar ratios of 1:50 and 1:100 sTREM2: Aβ) inhibited Aβ oligomerization (Fig. 2A) quantified by area (Fig. 2B) or number (Fig. S7i). SEC and antibody dot blots confirmed that sTREM2 inhibited formation of Aβ oligomers (Fig. S8i). Analysis of the size distribution of Aβ oligomers by TEM revealed that wild-type sTREM2 reduced the abundance of small oligomers (oligomer size <60 nm2) and eliminated larger oligomers (oligomer size >70 nm2) (Fig. S9i). In contrast, R47H sTREM2 did not block Aβ oligomerization, but instead promoted the formation of morphologically-distinct Aβ protofibrils (Fig. 2, C and D; Figs. S7ii and S9ii). Thus, the presence of wild-type sTREM2 reduces the formation of Aβ oligomers, particularly larger oligomers, and in stark contrast, R47H sTREM2 induces Aβ monomers to form Aβ protofibrils. To study reversal of oligomerization, preassembled Aβ oligomers were diluted to 2 μM and mixed with wild-type or R47H sTREM2 (at molar ratios of sTREM2: total Aβ of: 1:5 and 1:1) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The Aβ assemblies were then assessed using the same methods as above. This experiment revealed that wild-type sTREM2 disaggregated preformed Aβ oligomers (TEM in Fig. 2, C and D and Fig. S7ii; anti-A11 dot blot and HPLC-SEC assays in Fig. S8ii). Wild-type sTREM2 strongly reduced the abundance of all but the very smallest oligomers (Fig. 2C & Fig. S9ii). In contrast, R47H sTREM2 increased the abundance of Aβ oligomers and induced the formation of morphologically-distinct Aβ protofibrils (Fig. 2C & Figs. S7ii and S9ii). Aβ protofibrils are large, linear Aβ oligomers, formed from Aβ monomers in a variety of conditions (25Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

We repeated these experiments at lower concentrations, using preformed Aβ oligomers at 100 nM Aβ (monomer equivalent) incubated with 20 or 100 nM sTREM2. Wild-type sTREM2 (at either concentration) induced rapid dissolution of the Aβ oligomers (Figs. S10 and S11). In contrast, treatment with R47H sTREM2 induced aggregation of Aβ oligomers into much larger Aβ assemblies (Figs. S10 and S11). Because wild-type sTREM2 inhibited Aβ oligomerization and disaggregated Aβ oligomers, we decided to test whether sTREM2 affected Aβ fibrillization. In the absence of sTREM2, Aβ (10 μM) fibrillized with standard lag-phase kinetics as measured with Thioflavin T fluorescence. However, 1 μM of wild-type sTREM2 almost completely prevented Aβ fibrillization (Fig. 3, A–C). In total, 1 μM of R47H sTREM2 did not prevent Aβ fibrillization, but the Thioflavin T fluorescence was lower (Fig. 3A), suggesting fibrils with less β sheet structure. Repeating these experiments, at lower concentrations and higher temperature, gave similar results. Thus, fibrillization of 2 μM Aβ was substantially delayed by 20 nM sTREM2 (i.e., a 100:1 ratio) and prevented by 1 μM sTREM2 (Fig. 3D). In contrast, at the same low dose (20 nM), R47H sTREM2 had minimal effect on Aβ fibrillization (Fig. 3E). To test whether sTREM2 could disaggregate fibrils of Aβ, small fibrils were preassembled and di"
https://openalex.org/W3141653433,"Objective This study aims to assess the magnitude and associated factors of poor medication adherence among diabetic and hypertensive patients visiting public health facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A multi-site cross-sectional design was conducted from 1 st through 30 th of August 2020 at public health facilities of the study area. Adult outpatients with T2DM and hypertension visiting hospitals and health centers were included in the study. A proportion to size allocation method was used to determine the required sample size per facility. Data was collected using the 8-item Morisky medication adherence scale. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used to analyze data. A 95% confidence interval and p≤0.05 statistical significance was considered to determine factors associated with poor medication adherence. Results A total of 409 patients were included in the present study. About 57% of the patients reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has posed negative impacts on either of their follow-up visits, availability of medications, or affordability of prices. And, 21% have reported that they have been affected in all aspects. The overall magnitude of poor medication adherence was 72%. Patients with extreme poverty were more likely to have good medication adherence (AOR: 0.59; 95%C.I: 0.36–0.97), whereas attendance to a health center (AOR: 1.71; 95%C.I: 1.02–2.85), presence of comorbidity (AOR: 2.05; 95%C.I: 1.13–3.71), and current substance use history (AOR: 11.57; 95%C.I: 1.52–88.05) predicted high odds of poor adherence. Conclusion Over a three-fourth of the patients, in the study setting, have poor adherence to their anti-diabetic and antihypertensive medications. Health facility type, income level, comorbidity, and current substance use history showed a statistically significant association with poor adherence to medication. Stakeholders should set alternative strategies as perceived impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on medication adherence are high in the study area."
https://openalex.org/W3150476388,"Neural stem cell (NSC) populations persist in the adult vertebrate brain over a lifetime, and their homeostasis is controlled at the population level through unknown mechanisms. Here, we combine dynamic imaging of entire NSC populations in their in vivo niche over several weeks with pharmacological manipulations, mathematical modeling, and spatial statistics and demonstrate that NSCs use spatiotemporally resolved local feedback signals to coordinate their decision to divide in adult zebrafish brains. These involve Notch-mediated short-range inhibition from transient neural progenitors and a dispersion effect from the dividing NSCs themselves exerted with a delay of 9–12 days. Simulations from a stochastic NSC lattice model capturing these interactions demonstrate that these signals are linked by lineage progression and control the spatiotemporal distribution of output neurons. These results highlight how local and temporally delayed interactions occurring between brain germinal cells generate self-propagating dynamics that maintain NSC population homeostasis and coordinate specific spatiotemporal correlations."

We investigated the mechanism by which lncRNA SNHG6 promotes the development of HCC. RT-qPCR revealed upregulated lncRNA SNHG6 in the HCC setting. Elevated SNHG6 expression was indicative of poor prognosis in patients with HCC. SNHG6 overexpression resulted in increased cyclin D1, cyclin E1, and E2F1 expression both in vitro and in vivo. SNHG6 also promoted HCC cell proliferation by enhancing G1-S phase transition in vitro. Dual luciferase reporter assays, RIP, and RNA pull-down assays demonstrated SNHG6 competitively bound to miR-204-5p and inhibited its expression preventing miR-204-5p from targeting E2F1. Overexpression of miR-204-5p abolished the effect of SNHG6. Our data suggest that SNHG6 functions as a ceRNA that targets miR-204-5p resulting in an increased E2F1 expression and enhanced G1-S phase transition, thereby promoting the tumorigenesis of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W3142339389,"Background Data on the role of hypothyroidism in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver fibrosis are conflicting, although selective Thyroid Hormone Receptor (THR)-β agonists have been identified as potential therapy in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Therefore, we investigated the association between hypothyroidism and NAFLD histological features potentially associated with progressive liver disease. Methods Between 2014 and 2016, consecutive patients with histologically proven NAFLD and frozen serum available for thyroid function tests assessment were included. NAFLD was staged according to the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS), and fibrosis according to Kleiner. NASH was defined as NAS ≥4, significant fibrosis as F2-F4 and significant steatosis as S2-S3. Thyroid function tests (TFT; TSH, FT3, FT4, rT3), TPO-Ab and Tg-Ab were also assessed. Results Fifty-two patients were analyzed: median age 54 years, 58% females, LSM 7.8 kPa, 27% diabetics, 14% hypothyroid. At histology, NASH was present in 21 (40%), F2-F4 in 28 (54%) and S2-S3 in 30 (58%) patients. Rates of hypothyroidism were similar independently of the presence of NASH (p = 0.11), significant fibrosis (p = 0.21) or steatosis (p = 0.75). However, hypothyroid patients displayed a higher NAS (p = 0.02) and NASH (p = 0.06) prevalence. At multivariate analysis, TFT were not independently associated with histology. Conclusion Hypothyroidism was highly prevalent in NAFLD patients, and was associated with increased NAFLD activity, but not with fibrosis and steatosis severity. Thus, thyroid dysfunction might play a direct and/or indirect in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH."
https://openalex.org/W3146660820,"Raptors, including eagles, are geographically widespread and sit atop the food chain, thereby serving an important role in maintaining ecosystem balance. After facing population declines associated with exposure to organochlorine insecticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), bald eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) have recovered from the brink of extinction. However, both bald and golden eagles ( Aquila chrysaetos ) are exposed to a variety of other toxic compounds in the environment that could have population impacts. Few studies have focused on anticoagulant rodenticide (AR) exposure in eagles. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the types of ARs that eagles are exposed to in the USA and better define the extent of toxicosis (i.e., fatal illness due to compound exposure). Diagnostic case records from bald and golden eagles submitted to the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study (University of Georgia) 2014 through 2018 were reviewed. Overall, 303 eagles were examined, and the livers from 116 bald eagles and 17 golden eagles were tested for ARs. The percentage of AR exposure (i.e., detectable levels but not associated with mortality) in eagles was high; ARs were detected in 109 (82%) eagles, including 96 (83%) bald eagles and 13 (77%) golden eagles. Anticoagulant rodenticide toxicosis was determined to be the cause of mortality in 12 (4%) of the 303 eagles examined, including 11 bald eagles and 1 golden eagle. Six different AR compounds were detected in these eagles, with brodifacoum and bromadiolone most frequently detected (81% and 25% of eagles tested, respectively). These results suggest that some ARs, most notably brodifacoum, are widespread in the environment and are commonly consumed by eagles. This highlights the need for research to understand the pathways of AR exposure in eagles, which may help inform policy and regulatory actions to mitigate AR exposure risk."
https://openalex.org/W3148505793,"Radiotherapy is essential to the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and acquired or innate resistance to this therapeutic modality is a major clinical problem. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms in the radiation resistance in NPC are not fully understood. Here, we reanalyzed the microarray data from public databases and identified the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type D (PTPRD) as a candidate gene. We found that PTPRD was downregulated in clinical NPC tissues and NPC cell lines with its promoter hypermethylated. Functional assays revealed that PTPRD overexpression sensitized NPC to radiation in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, miR-454-3p directly targets PTPRD to inhibit its expression and biological effect. Interestingly, mechanistic analyses indicate that PTPRD directly dephosphorylates STAT3 to enhance Autophagy-Related 5 (ATG5) transcription, resulting in triggering radiation-induced autophagy. The immunohistochemical staining of 107 NPC revealed that low PTPRD and high p-STAT3 levels predicted poor clinical outcome. Overall, we showed that PTPRD promotes radiosensitivity by triggering radiation-induced autophagy via the dephosphorylation of STAT3, thus providing a potentially useful predictive biomarker for NPC radiosensitivity and drug target for NPC radiosensitization."
https://openalex.org/W3140243149,"A timely detection of patients with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4 ) -deficient types of hyperphenylalaninemia (HPABH 4 ) is important for assignment of correct therapy, allowing to avoid complications. Often HPABH 4 patients receive the same therapy as phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) -deficiency (phenylketonuria) patients—dietary treatment—and do not receive substitutive BH 4 therapy until the diagnosis is confirmed by molecular genetic means. In this study, we present a cohort of 30 Russian patients with HPABH 4 with detected variants in genes causing different types of HPA. Family diagnostics and biochemical urinary pterin spectrum analyses were carried out. HPABH 4 A is shown to be the prevalent type, 83.3% of all HPABH 4 cases. The mutation spectrum for the PTS gene was defined, the most common variants in Russia were p.Thr106Met—32%, p.Asn72Lys—20%, p.Arg9His—8%, p.Ser32Gly—6%. We also detected 7 novel PTS variants and 3 novel QDPR variants. HPABH 4 prevalence was estimated to be 0.5–0.9% of all HPA cases in Russia, which is significantly lower than in European countries on average, China, and Saudi Arabia. The results of this research show the necessity of introducing differential diagnostics for HPABH 4 into neonatal screening practice."

We also aimed to investigate factors that could potentially affect VPTs such as age, sex, height, weight, foot- or handedness and skin temperature. Methods VPTs were examined in 924 healthy and randomly selected subjects in the southern Sweden (mean 46 years; 628 women and 296 men). Inclusion criterias were adult subjects (&gt;18 years) in considerable health without diabetes mellitus or other nerve affecting disorders. VPTs were measured at the finger pulps of index and little finger, as well as the first and fifth metatarsal heads of the foot, through multi-frequency vibrometry using the VibroSense Meter® I device. Patient characteristics were recorded and skin temperature was measured before assessment of VPTs. Results We present normative values of VPTs for a large population of both male and female subjects in various ages. VPTs detoriated as age increased (0.09–0.59 dB per year; p&lt;0.001), i.e. progressing with normal aging. Increasing skin temperature affected VPTs in finger pulps, but not at metatarsal heads, with -0.2 to -1.6 dB, i.e. vibration perception improved with higher temperatures. Height was only found to affect the VPTs of metatarsal heads (250 Hz: 0.42 dB per cm). Sex, weight and handedness did not affect the VPTs. Conclusion We investigated the normative values of VPTs and presented affecting factors as age, skin temperature and height. With these results, VPT testing through multi-frequency vibrometry is enabled to be used in a clinical practice as a diagnostic tool when investigating neuropathy and other neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3143581796,"Background and aims Neutrophil-derived heparin binding protein (HBP; also known as azurocidin or CAP-37) is a key player in bacterial sepsis and a promising biomarker in severe infections. The aims of this study were to assess whether HBP is involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and, if so, whether it can be used to predict severe disease preferably using a point-of-care test. Methods This was a prospective convenience sample study of biomarkers in patients admitted to Skåne University hospital in Sweden with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Plasma samples and clinical data were collected within 72h after admission, during hospital stay and at discharge. Plasma HBP concentrations samples were measured both with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and with a novel dry immunofluorescence analyzer (Joinstar) point-of-care test. Results Thirty-five COVID-19 patients were enrolled in the study. Twenty-nine patients had blood samples taken within 72h after admission. We compared the highest HBP value taken within 72h after admission in patients who eventually developed organ dysfunction (n = 23) compared to those who did not (n = 6), and found that HBP was significantly elevated in those who developed organ dysfunction (25.0 ng/mL (interquartile range (IQR) 16.6–48.5) vs 10.6 ng/mL (IQR 4.8–21.7 ng/mL), p = 0.03). Point-of-care test measurements correlated well with ELISA measurements (R = 0.83). HBP measured by the POC device predicted development of COVID-induced organ dysfunction with an AUC of 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70–1.0). Conclusions HBP is elevated prior to onset of organ dysfunction in patients with severe COVID-19 using a newly developed point-of-care test and hence HBP could be used in a clinical setting as a prognostic marker in COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3149472239,"In this study we aimed to 1) describe healthy ageing trajectory patterns, 2) examine the association between multimorbidity and patterns of healthy ageing trajectories, and 3) evaluate how different groups of diseases might affect the projection of healthy ageing trajectories over time.Our study was based on 130880 individuals from the Ageing Trajectories of Health: Longitudinal Opportunities and Synergies (ATHLOS) harmonised dataset, as well as 9171 individuals from Waves 2-7 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA).Using a healthy ageing index score, which comprised 41 items, covering various domains of health and ageing, as outcome, we employed the growth mixture model approach to identify the latent classes of individuals with different healthy ageing trajectories. A multinomial logistic regression was conducted to assess if and how multimorbidity status and multimorbidity patterns were associated with changes in healthy ageing, controlled for sociodemographic and lifestyle risk factors.Three similar patterns of healthy ageing trajectories were identified in the ATHLOS and ELSA datasets: 1) a 'high stable' group (76% in ATHLOS, 61% in ELSA), 2) a 'low stable' group (22% in ATHLOS, 36% in ELSA) and 3) a 'rapid decline' group (2% in ATHLOS, 3% in ELSA). Those with multimorbidity were 1.7 times (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.4-2.1) more likely to be in the 'rapid decline' group and 11.7 times (OR = 11.7 95% CI: 10.9-12.6) more likely to be in the 'low stable' group, compared with people without multimorbidity. The cardiorespiratory/arthritis/cataracts group was associated with both the 'rapid decline' and the 'low stable' groups (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2-3.8 and OR = 9.8, 95% CI: 7.5-12.7 respectively).Healthy ageing is heterogeneous. While multimorbidity was associated with higher odds of having poorer healthy ageing trajectories, the extent to which healthy ageing trajectories were projected to decline depended on the specific patterns of multimorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W3152000791,"Outcomes from restoration projects are often difficult for policymakers and stakeholders to assess, but this information is fundamental for scaling up ecological restoration actions. We evaluated technical aspects of the interventions, results (ecological and socio-economic) and monitoring practices in 75 restoration projects in Mexico using a digital survey composed of 137 questions. We found that restoration projects in terrestrial ecosystems generally relied on actions included in minimal (97%) and maximal (86%) intervention, while in wetlands, the preferred restoration strategies were intermediate (75%) and minimal intervention (63%). Only a third of the projects (38%) relied on collective learning as a source of knowledge to generate techniques (traditional management). In most of the projects (73%), multiple criteria (&gt;2) were considered when selecting plant species for plantings; the most frequently used criterion was that plant species were found within the restoration area, native or naturalized (i.e., a circa situm criterion; 88%). In 48% of the projects, the biological material required for restoration (e.g., seeds and seedlings) were gathered or propagated by project implementers rather than purchased commercially. Only a few projects (between 33 and 34%) reached a high level of biodiversity recovery (&gt;75%). Most of the projects (between 69 to71%) recovered less than 50% of the ecological services. Most of the projects (82%) led to improved individual relationships. The analysis revealed a need to implement strategies that are cost-effective, the application of traditional ecological knowledge and the inclusion of indigenous people and local communities in restoration programs at all stages—from planning to implementation, through monitoring. We also identified the need to expand research to develop effective tools to assess ecosystems’ regeneration potential and develop theoretical frameworks to move beyond short-term markers to set and achieve medium- and long-term goals. Cautious and comprehensive planning of national strategies must consider the abovementioned identified gaps."
https://openalex.org/W3146374606,"Background Hemophilic arthropathy, a condition manifested as joint destruction due to spontaneous joint bleeding, is one complication of hemophiliac patients. Early detection and intervention may improve the outcome, in which ultrasonography can be an ideal modality with the introduction of HEAD-US (Hemophilia Early Arthropathy Detection with Ultrasound) protocol. Studies have shown US benefit in hemophiliac patients, including its potential as an alternative for the Hemophiliac Joint Health Score (HJHS) system. However, many of the studies were conducted in countries with better management of hemophilia using prophylaxis treatment. It is unclear whether HEAD-US has a correlation with HJHS in countries using episodic treatment only, like in Indonesia. Purpose This study aimed to explore the correlation between HEAD-US and HJHS in hemophiliac patients with joint problems in Indonesia. Materials and methods A cross-sectional correlation study between HEAD-US and HJHS was performed with primary data collected from 120 hemophilic patients. US examination was performed on elbow, knee and ankle joints using the HEAD-US scoring method by a musculoskeletal radiologist. HJHS examination was conducted by a trained physiotherapist and a medical rehabilitation specialist. All examiner is member of multidisciplinary Hemophiliac Management Team in Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Results The mean age of the participant was 9.3 (5–14) years old. The median score of HEAD-US was 8 (1–28) with most of the joint abnormalities found on the ankles. The median score of HJHS was 3 (0–35), with most joint abnormalities found on the knees. There was a moderate correlation between HEAD-US and HJHS score (p &lt; 0.05, r = 0.65). Conclusion HEAD-US shows a moderate correlation to HJHS in hemophiliac patients who received episodic treatment. HEAD-US can provide additional value in the anatomical evaluation of the joint and could be complementary to HJHS in assessing the joint status in hemophilic patient"
https://openalex.org/W3149188060,"Unchecked inflammation can result in severe diseases with high mortality, such as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). MAS and associated cytokine storms have been observed in COVID-19 patients exhibiting systemic hyperinflammation. Interleukin-18 (IL-18), a proinflammatory cytokine belonging to the IL-1 family, is elevated in both MAS and COVID-19 patients, and its level is known to correlate with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. IL-18 binds its specific receptor IL-1 receptor 5 (IL-1R5, also known as IL-18 receptor alpha chain), leading to the recruitment of the coreceptor, IL-1 receptor 7 (IL-1R7, also known as IL-18 receptor beta chain). This heterotrimeric complex then initiates downstream signaling, resulting in systemic and local inflammation. Here, we developed a novel humanized monoclonal anti-IL-1R7 antibody to specifically block the activity of IL-18 and its inflammatory signaling. We characterized the function of this antibody in human cell lines, in freshly obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in human whole blood cultures. We found that the anti-IL-1R7 antibody significantly suppressed IL-18-mediated NFκB activation, reduced IL-18-stimulated IFNγ and IL-6 production in human cell lines, and reduced IL-18-induced IFNγ, IL-6, and TNFα production in PBMCs. Moreover, the anti-IL-1R7 antibody significantly inhibited LPS- and Candida albicans-induced IFNγ production in PBMCs, as well as LPS-induced IFNγ production in whole blood cultures. Our data suggest that blocking IL-1R7 could represent a potential therapeutic strategy to specifically modulate IL-18 signaling and may warrant further investigation into its clinical potential for treating IL-18-mediated diseases, including MAS and COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3151964282,"Therapeutic strategies to treat pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain unsatisfying and limited. Therefore, it is imperative to fully determine the mechanisms underlying PDAC progression. In the present study, we report a novel role of regulator of calcineurin 1, isoform 4 (RCAN1.4) in regulating PDAC progression. We demonstrated that RCAN1.4 expression was decreased significantly in PDAC tissues compared with that in para-cancerous tissues, and correlated with poor prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer. In vitro, stable high expression of RCAN1.4 could suppress the metastasis and proliferation and angiogenesis of pancreatic tumor cells. In addition, interferon alpha inducible protein 27 (IFI27) was identified as having a functional role in RCAN1.4-mediated PDAC migration and invasion, while VEGFA play a vital role in RCAN1.4-mediated PDAC angiogenesis. Analysis of mice with subcutaneously/orthotopic implanted xenograft tumors and liver metastasis model confirmed that RCAN1.4 could modulate the growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis of tumors via IFI27/VEGFA in vivo. In conclusion, our results suggested that RCAN1.4 suppresses the growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis of PDAC, functioning partly via IFI27 and VEGFA.

https://openalex.org/W3152249747,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) can be endogenously produced and belongs to the class of signaling molecules known as gasotransmitters. Cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE)-derived H2 S is implicated in the regulation of cell differentiation and the aging process, but the involvements of the CSE/H2 S system in myogenesis upon aging and injury have not been explored. In this study, we demonstrated that CSE acts as a major H2 S-generating enzyme in skeletal muscles and is significantly down-regulated in aged skeletal muscles in mice. CSE deficiency exacerbated the age-dependent sarcopenia and cardiotoxin-induced injury/regeneration in mouse skeletal muscle, possibly attributed to inefficient myogenesis. In contrast, supplement of NaHS (an H2 S donor) induced the expressions of myogenic genes and promoted muscle regeneration in mice. In vitro, incubation of myoblast cells (C2C12) with H2 S promoted myogenesis, as evidenced by the inhibition of cell cycle progression and migration, altered expressions of myogenic markers, elongation of myoblasts, and formation of multinucleated myotubes. Myogenesis was also found to upregulate CSE expression, while blockage of CSE/H2 S signaling resulted in a suppression of myogenesis. Mechanically, H2 S significantly induced the heterodimer formation between MEF2c and MRF4 and promoted the binding of MEF2c/MRF4 to myogenin promoter. MEF2c was S-sulfhydrated at both cysteine 361 and 420 in the C-terminal transactivation domain, and blockage of MEF2c S-sulfhydration abolished the stimulatory role of H2 S on MEF2c/MRF4 heterodimer formation. These findings support an essential role for H2 S in maintaining myogenesis, presenting it as a potential candidate for the prevention of age-related sarcopenia and treatment of muscle injury."
https://openalex.org/W3140348034,"Introduction The prevalence of periodontal disease is high in diabetes patients worldwide, including Bangladesh. Although associations of periodontal disease outcomes and clinical determinants of diabetes have been investigated, few studies have reported on the relationship between periodontal diseases outcomes with modifiable factors, such as self-care and oral hygiene practices, in patients with diabetes. Moreover, in order to develop targeted strategies, it is also important to estimate their aggregated contribution separately from that of the established sociodemographic and diabetics related clinical determinates. Therefore, this study was performed to elucidate 1) the relationship of diabetes patients’ self-care and oral hygiene practices to periodontal disease and 2) the relative contributions of selected factors to periodontal disease outcome in type 2 diabetes patients. Methods The data were obtained from the baseline survey of a multicentre, prospective cohort study. A total of 379 adult patients with type 2 diabetes from three diabetic centres in Dhaka, Rajshahi and Barishal, received periodontal examinations using the community periodontal index (CPI) probe, glycated haemoglobin examination, other clinical examinations, and structured questionnaires. Multiple logistics regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between selected factors and prevalence of any periodontal disease and its severity. Results More than half of the participants were female (53.8%) and 66.8% of the total participants was 21–50 years old. The prevalence of any (CPI code 2+3+4; 75.7%) and severe form (CPI code 4; 35.1%) of periodontal disease were high in type 2 diabetes patients. In multivariate analysis, the odds of periodontal disease increased with unfavourable glycaemic control indicated by HbA1c ≥ 7%, and decreased by 64%, 85% and 92% with adherence to recommended diet, physical activity, and oral hygiene practices, respectively. Diabetes self-care practice explained the highest proportion of the variance (13.9%) followed by oral hygiene practices (10.9%) by modelling any periodontal disease versus no disease. Variables of diabetes conditions and oral hygiene practices explained 10.9% and 7.3% of the variance by modelling severe (CPI code 4) or moderate (CPI code 3) forms of periodontal disease versus mild form of periodontal disease. Findings also conferred that while poor diabetes control had an individually adverse association with any form of periodontal diseases and its severity, the risk of diseases was moderated by oral hygiene practices. Conclusions This study suggested that, in addition to diabetes-related clinical determinants, self-care practices, and oral hygiene practices must be taken into consideration for prevention and control of periodontal disease in patients with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3140869564,"Paullinieae are a diverse group of tropical and subtropical climbing plants that belong to the soapberry family (Sapindaceae). The six genera in this tribe make up approximately one-quarter of the species in the family, but a sparse fossil record limits our understanding of their diversification. Here, we provide the first description of anatomically preserved fossils of Paullinieae and we re-evaluate other macrofossils that have been attributed to the tribe. We identified permineralized fossil roots in collections from the lower Miocene Cucaracha Formation where it was exposed along the Culebra Cut of the Panama Canal. We prepared the fossils using the cellulose acetate peel technique and compared the anatomy with that of extant Paullinieae. The fossil roots preserve a combination of characters found only in Paullinieae, including peripheral secondary vascular strands, vessel dimorphism, alternate intervessel pitting with coalescent apertures, heterocellular rays, and axial parenchyma strands of 2-4 cells, often with prismatic crystals. We also searched the paleontological literature for other occurrences of the tribe. We re-evaluated leaf fossils from western North America that have been assigned to extant genera in the tribe by comparing their morphology to herbarium specimens and cleared leaves. The fossil leaves that were assigned to Cardiospermum and Serjania from the Paleogene of western North America are likely Sapindaceae; however, they lack diagnostic characters necessary for inclusion in Paullinieae and should be excluded from those genera. Therefore, the fossils described here as Ampelorhiza heteroxylon gen. et sp. nov. are the oldest macrofossil evidence of Paullinieae. They provide direct evidence of the development of a vascular cambial variant associated with the climbing habit in Sapindaceae and provide strong evidence of the diversification of crown-group Paullinieae in the tropics by 18.5-19 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W3141011348,"The contemporary concept of sexual counseling for women with sexual problems, distress, and female sexual dysfunction (FSD) includes tailored medical and/or psychological intervention. The dual control model and the Sexual Excitation/Sexual Inhibition Inventory for Women (SESII-W) are helpful for identifying risk factors and tailoring therapy for FSD. The current study aimed to (1) validate the Polish translation of the SESII-W in a sample of Polish women, and (2) verify the usefulness of the SESII-W in clinical practice. Five hundred nine white women age 18 to 55 years old ( M ± SD age = 39.7 ± 11.3 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. Linguistic validation of the Polish translation of the SESII-W was first performed. A battery of tests was then used to evaluate reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, measurement invariances, and correlations between the SESII-W and other measures. Given that the original version of the SESII-W had unsatisfactory model fit, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were subsequently performed. Results showed a new final model that included 26 items with seven lower- and two higher-order factors and explained 58.9% of the variance in the data, with CFI = 0.93, RMSEA = 0.05 and χ 2 = 693.39, p &lt; 0.001. Cronbach’s α was 0.77 for Sexual Excitation (SE) and 0.88 for Sexual Inhibition (SI) scales. A moderate negative association between SI and the presence of FSD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) criteria was noted. SE was positively associated with engaging in risky sexual behaviors, Extraversion and Openness to Experiences traits, and was negatively correlated with relationship quality. Finally, age was negatively correlated with all domains of the SESII-W except Arousal Contingency. SE and SI were both lower in older women as compared to younger once. These results demonstrate that the Polish version of SESII-W shows good psychometric properties. A higher propensity for SI was associated with the presence of sexual problems, distress, and FSD, whereas a higher propensity for SE was associated with greater engagement in risky sexual behaviors and personality type. However, future studies on larger and more diverse populations are required to confirm the replicability of the factor structure of the scale."

Methods Serum samples (n = 114) from 34 COVID-19 patients with mild to critical clinical manifestations were examined. The presence and titers of IgG antibody for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were determined by a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) using Alinity i SARS-CoV-2 IgG and by an immunochromatographic (IC) IgM/IgG antibody assay using the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Test. Results IgG was detected by the CMIA in 40%, 88%, and 100% of samples collected within 1 week, 1–2 weeks, and 2 weeks after symptom onset in severe and critical cases, and 0%, 38%, and 100% in mild/moderate cases, respectively. In severe and critical cases, the positive IgG detection rate with the IC assay was 60% within one week and 63% between one and two weeks. In mild/moderate cases, the positive IgG rate was 17% within one week and 63% between one and two weeks; IgM was positive in 80% and 75% of severe and critical cases, and 42% and 88% of mild/moderate cases, respectively. On the CMIA, no anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected in COVID-19 outpatients with mild symptoms within 10 days from onset, whereas 50% of samples from severe inpatients were IgG-positive in the same period. The IC assay detected higher IgM positivity earlier from symptom onset in severe and critical cases than in mild/moderate cases. Conclusions A serologic anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody analysis can complement PCR for diagnosing COVID-19 14 days after symptom onset."

https://openalex.org/W3142153518,"Previous research investigating language in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has demonstrated several deficits in many aspects. However, no previous study employed quantitative methodology providing objective measures that could be compared among different studies with diverse samples. To fill this gap, we used network analysis to investigate how ADHD symptomatology impacts narrative discourse, a complex linguistic task considered to be an ecological measure of language. Fifty-eight adults (34 females and 24 males) with a mean age of 26 years old and a mean of 17 years of educational level were administered the Adult Self-Rating Scale for ADHD symptomatology. They also completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory and the Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking Behavior Scale. Intelligence quotient was calculated. Individuals were asked to tell a story based on a wordless picture book. Speech was recorded and transcribed as an input to SpeechGraphs software. Parameters were total number of words (TNW), number of loops of one node (L1), repeated edges (RE), largest strongly connected component (LSC) and average shortest path (ASP). Verbosity was controlled. Statistical analysis was corrected for multiples comparisons and partial correlations were performed for confounding variables. After controlling for anxiety, depression, IQ, and impulsiveness ADHD symptomatology was positively correlated with L1 and negatively correlated with LSC. TNW was positively correlated with ADHD symptoms. In a subdomain analysis, both inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity were negatively correlated with LSC. Only hyperactivity-impulsivity positively correlated with TNW and L1. Results indicated a correlation between ADHD symptoms and lower connectedness in narrative discourse (as indicated by higher L1 and lower LSC), as well as higher total number of words (TNW). Our results suggest that the higher the number of ADHD symptoms, the less connectivity among words, and a higher number of words in narrative discourse."
https://openalex.org/W3145298160,"In the rapidly changing high-tech industry, firms that produce multi-generational products struggle to consistently introduce new products that are superior in innovativeness. However, developing innovative products in a short time sequence period is likely to cause quality problems. Therefore, considering time and resource constraints, two kinds of strategies are commonly employed: sequential innovation strategy , sequentially introducing a new generation of technology product at every launch interval, ensuring timely innovativeness but with relatively uncertain quality, or quality strategy , intermittently introducing a new generation of products, together with a derivative model between generations to enhance the quality. In this study, we propose a framework for a cost–benefit analysis that compares these two strategies by considering competition between firms within a generation as well as that within a firm across multiple generations (i.e., cannibalization) throughout the launch cycle of high-tech products. We apply our proposed framework to the smartphone market and conduct a sensitivity analysis. The results are expected to contribute to strategic decision-making related to the introduction of multi-generational technology products."

The SU2C Genomics-Enabled Medicine for Melanoma Trial utilized a Simon two-stage optimal design to assess whether comprehensive genomic profiling improves selection of molecular-based therapies for BRAF V600 wt metastatic melanoma patients who had progressed on standard-of-care therapy, which may include immunotherapy. Of the response-evaluable patients, binimetinib was selected for 20 patients randomized to the genomics-enabled arm, and nine were treated on the alternate treatment arm. Response rates for 27 patients treated with targeted recommendations included one (4%) partial response, 18 (67%) with stable disease, and eight (30%) with progressive disease. Post-trial genomic and protein pathway activation mapping identified additional drug classes that may be considered for future studies. Our results highlight the complexity and heterogeneity of metastatic melanomas, as well as how the lack of response in this trial may be associated with limitations including monotherapy drug selection and the dearth of available single and combination molecularly-driven therapies to treat BRAF V600 wt metastatic melanomas."
https://openalex.org/W3145742525,"Based on the biological, nutrients and hydrological data in August 2018, the vertical chlorophyll a (Chl- a ) concentration profiles and the relationship among surface Chl- a (Chl- a (0) ) concentration, maximum Chl- a (Chl- a (m) ) concentration and depth-integrated Chl- a (Chl- a (int) ) concentration were studied in the Northern South China Sea (NSCS). The results indicate that there are 4 different patterns in the vertical Chl- a profiles in the NSCS: (i) Chl- a increases with depth from the surface (e.g. station 1); (ii) there exists subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM), with low Chl- a on the surface and at the bottom layers respectively (e.g. station 5); (iii) there is no SCM, only with high Chl- a on the surface and in the bottom (e.g. station 14); (iv) the 4 th pattern is similar to (ii), with the higher Chl- a (0) (e.g. station 28). The SCM is observed at 95% stations in the NSCS and is not detected only at a few stations near the Pearl River (PR) estuary. These patterns are mainly regulated by alternative limitation of nutrients and light from the surface to the bottom of euphotic layer. For the pattern 1 (e.g. station 1), light is not a limited factor, and Chl- a and nutrients increase with depth. The pattern 2 (e.g. station 5) exists with the limitation of surface nutrients in offshore region. The nutrients increases with depth and the nutrients limitation turns to light limitation gradually from surface to bottom. And the SCM appears in the layer which need of the light and nutrients is roughly equivalent. Compared with that the offshore SCM, the nutrients for the pattern 3 (e.g. station 14) are rich on the surface with nutrients concentration and light irradiance. Therefore, it is seawater intrusion from the bottom that brings the higher nutrients concentration. The reason for the high Chl- a (0) on the pattern 4 (e.g. station 28) is terrestrial matter from the nearshore. High correlation (R 2 = 0.5206, p&lt;0.01) between the depth of SCM (Depth (m) ) and Chl- a (0) indicates that the SCM depth is regulated by light masking effect of surface phytoplankton, generally with shallow nutriclines and fast light attenuation for high Chl- a (0) and vice versa low Chl- a (0) brings deeper nutriclines and light attenuate slowly with less shading effect. Further research results shows that Chl- a (int) and Chl- a (m) have a good correlation(R 2 = 0.6397, p&lt;0.01). However, the correlation between Chl- a (int) and Chl- a (0) is relative weak (R 2 = 0.3202, p&lt;0.01). That could be attributed to the availability of nutrients playing an important role in growth of phytoplankton, with high nutrients at upper euphotic layers for the stations with high Chl- a (0) ."
https://openalex.org/W3147272297,"The arm elevation strategy assists in recovering stability during slips in healthy young and elderly individuals. However, in people with Parkinson’s Disease, one of the main motor symptoms affecting the upper limbs is reduced arm swing which intensifies throughout the course of the disease before becoming absent. This holds direct implications for these individuals when encountering slips as the arm elevation strategy is an integral component in the interlimb slip response to restore stability. Arm swing’s effect in recovering from slips in people with Parkinson’s Disease though remains unexamined. Twenty people with Parkinson’s Disease (63.78 ± 8.97 years) walked with restricted and unrestricted arm swing conditions on a dual-belt treadmill where slips were induced on the least and most affected sides. Data were collected on the CAREN Extended System (Motek Medical, Amsterdam, NL). The Margin of Stability, linear and angular trunk velocities, as well as step length, time, and width were calculated. Data were examined during the slipped step and recovery step. The restricted arm swing condition, compared to unrestricted, caused a faster step time during the slipped step. Compared to the most affected leg, the least affected had a wider step width during the slipped step. During the recovery step, the least affected leg had a larger anteroposterior Margin of Stability and longer step time than the most affected. No differences between our arm swing conditions suggests that the normal arm swing in our participants was not more effective at restoring stability after an induced slip compared to when their arm motion was restricted. This may be due to the arm elevation strategy being ineffective in counteracting the slip’s backward destabilization in these individuals. Differences between the legs revealed that our participants were asymmetrically impaired in their slip recovery response."

The shared characteristic these diseases feature is their uncontrollable fibrogenesis deemed responsible for the accumulated damage in the susceptible tissues. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis , an interstitial lung disease, is one of the most common and studied fibrotic diseases and still remains an active research target. In this study we highlight unique and common (i) genes, (ii) biological pathways and (iii) candidate repurposed drugs among 9 fibrotic diseases. We identify 7 biological pathways involved in all 9 fibrotic diseases as well as pathways unique to some of these diseases. Based on our Drug Repurposing results, we suggest captopril and ibuprofen that both appear to slow the progression of fibrotic diseases according to existing bibliography. We also recommend nafcillin and memantine, which haven’t been studied against fibrosis yet, for further wet-lab experimentation. We also observe a group of cardiomyopathy-related pathways that are exclusively highlighted for Oral Submucous Fibrosis . We suggest digoxin to be tested against Oral Submucous Fibrosis , since we observe cardiomyopathy-related pathways implicated in Oral Submucous Fibrosis and there is bibliographic evidence that digoxin may potentially clear myocardial fibrosis. Finally, we establish that Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis shares several involved genes, biological pathways and candidate inhibiting-drugs with Dupuytren’s Disease , IgG4-related Disease , Systemic Sclerosis and Cystic Fibrosis .

https://openalex.org/W3139981494,"The expansion of cities and their impacts currently constitutes a challenge for the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). In this respect, assessments of resource consumption and the delivery of appropriate policies to support resource conservation are of paramount importance. Previous works in the literature have focused on one specific resource (e.g., water, energy, food) at the household level, while others have analysed the inter-relations among different resources (i.e., the nexus approach) at larger spatial scales (e.g., urban level). Moreover, household behavioural attitudes are generally excluded while assessing resource consumption scenarios. This work overcomes previous limitations by proposing a causal-loop structure derived from the literature, from which simulations of different scenarios can be generated that consider the nexus between food, energy and water at the household level. These simulations can provide alternative scenarios to assess the impacts of monetary policies as well as education and communication actions on the enhancement of resource savings and consider both their current use and household preferences. The metropolitan area of Napoli was chosen as the testbed area for the simulations. The results, in relation to the testbed, proved that communication actions would be most appropriate to increase the level of resource savings. The business-as-usual scenario was especially sensitive to variations in individual preferences towards pro-environmental behaviours and showed their higher impacts on the results. Improvements of this method and its derived scenarios in the context of the urban planning process could support the implementation of informed policies towards the conservation of key resources and promotion of sustainable citizen behaviour."

Substrate-binding assays using fluorescence polarization (FP) confirm that AdoMet binding is a prerequisite for H3 binding for the MLL4 complex but not for the MLL3 complex.

In addition, MLL3 and MLL4 associate with the same set of specific accessory components, which are unique for the MLL3/4-branch KMT2 subfamily, including PTIP (Paired box (Pax) transactivation-domain interacting protein), PA1 (PTIP-associated 1), NCOA6 (Nuclear receptor COActivator 6), and KDM6A (Lysine Demethylase 6A, also known as UTX) (15Cho Y.W.

Apart from the identical complex composition, MLL3 and MLL4 complexes also possess many similar biochemical activities. For example, they both catalyze the monomethylation of H3K4 through C-terminal catalytic SET domains activated by associating with ASH2L-RBBP5 heterodimer directly (11Hu D. Gao X. Morgan M.A. Herz H.-M. Smith E.R. Shilatifard A. The MLL3/MLL4 branches of the COMPASS family function as major histone H3K4 monomethylases at enhancers.Mol. Cell.

Moreover, both the PHD6 domain of MLL4 and the corresponding PHD7 domain of MLL3 can bind to the H4 tail and specifically recognize H4K16Ac modification (16Dhar S.S. Lee S.H. Kan P.Y. Voigt P. Ma L.

Despite the indistinguishable biochemical properties of MLL3 and MLL4, their functions are not identical. Knockouts of Mll3 and Mll4 in mice generate distinct phenotypes. Mll3-knockout mice showed no significant morphological abnormalities during embryonic development but died around birth (4Lee J.E. Wang C. Xu S. Cho Y.W. Wang L. Feng X. Baldridge A. Sartorelli V. Zhuang L. Peng W. Ge K. H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase MLL4 is required for enhancer activation during cell differentiation.Elife. 2013; 2e01503Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, loss of Mll3 caused defects in lung maturation and respiratory failure at birth (19Ashokkumar D. Zhang Q. Much C. Bledau A.S. Naumann R. Alexopoulou D. Dahl A. Goveas N. Fu J. Anastassiadis K. MLL4 is required after implantation, whereas MLL3 becomes essential during late gestation.Development. 2020; 147dev186999Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In contrast, Mll4-knockout mice died at 9.5 days of embryonic life (4Lee J.E. Wang C. Xu S. Cho Y.W. Wang L. Feng X. Baldridge A. Sartorelli V. Zhuang L. Peng W. Ge K. H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase MLL4 is required for enhancer activation during cell differentiation.Elife. 2013; 2e01503Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), because Mll4 was required for migration of the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) to initiate gastrulation (19Ashokkumar D.

A. 2016; 113: 11871-11876Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Consistent with their nonredundant roles in cell fate transition, mutations of MLL3 and MLL4 are identified in different types of diseases and cancers. For example, a number of heterozygous MLL4 variants cause Kabuki syndrome, a rare congenital disorder disease, but MLL3 mutation has never been reported in Kabuki syndrome (21Faundes V. Malone G.

Genet. 2019; 64: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that MLL3 and MLL4 have their unique functions in cells. The apparent discrepancy between almost identical biochemical properties and distinct physiological functions intrigues us to investigate whether there is any potential biochemical difference between MLL3 and MLL4. We focus on the possible catalytic difference between MLL3 and MLL4, because their enzyme activities are critical for enhancer activation in ESC differentiation and adipogenesis (22Yan J. Chen S.A.

The catalytic domains of MLL3 and MLL4 have been structurally characterized (14Li Y. Han J. Zhang Y. Cao F. Liu Z. Li S. Wu J. Hu C. Wang Y. Shuai J. Chen J. Cao L. Li D. Shi P.

Evolving catalytic properties of the MLL family SET domain.Structure. 2015; 23: 1921-1933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but the research on the kinetic mechanism of MLL3 or MLL4-mediated catalytic process is still limited. Here, we use a continuous enzyme-coupled assay to elucidate the kinetic mechanisms of the minimized ternary complexes composed of the catalytic domains of MLL3 or MLL4 (MLL3SET or MLL4SET), ASH2L, and RBBP5. Steady-state kinetic analyses and inhibition studies reveal that the MLL3 complex catalyzes monomethylation of the histone H3 peptide with a random sequential bi–bi mechanism. On the contrary, the MLL4 complex utilizes an ordered sequential bi–bi mechanism. The difference of the conformational dynamics between MLL3 and MLL4 may result in the distinct kinetic mechanism. The unforeseen catalytic difference revealed in our work may provide critical insight into the distinct functions of MLL3 and MLL4 and give hints for inhibitor design targeting MLL3 or MLL4. The intrinsic enzymatic activity of the C-terminal catalytic SET domain of MLL3 and MLL4 is very low (14Li Y. Han J. Zhang Y. Cao F. Liu Z. Li S. Wu J. Hu C. Wang Y. Shuai J. Chen J. Cao L. Li D. Shi P. Tian C. et al.Structural basis for activity regulation of MLL family methyltransferases.Nature. 2016; 530: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that the minimal requirements for MLLSET activation are the splA and ryanodine receptor (SPRY) domain of ASH2L (ASH2LSPRY, residues 286–505) and a short fragment of RBBP5 (RBBP5AS-ABM, residues 330–360) (14Li Y. Han J. Zhang Y. Cao F. Liu Z. Li S. Wu J. Hu C. Wang Y. Shuai J. Chen J. Cao L. Li D. Shi P. Tian C. et al.Structural basis for activity regulation of MLL family methyltransferases.Nature. 2016; 530: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this work, the MLL3 or MLL4 ternary complex composed of MLL3 or MLL4 SET domain, RBBP5AS-ABM, and ASH2LSPRY were purified to >95% homogeneity as previously described (14Li Y. Han J. Zhang Y. Cao F. Liu Z. Li S. Wu J. Hu C. Wang Y. Shuai J. Chen J. Cao L. Li D. Shi P. Tian C. et al.Structural basis for activity regulation of MLL family methyltransferases.Nature. 2016; 530: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1A). The MLL3SET-RBBP5AS-ABM-ASH2LSPRY and MLL4SET-RBBP5AS-ABM-ASH2LSPRY were abbreviated as M3RA and M4RA, respectively, throughout this study. We first used Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization–Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to monitor the methylation progress of H3 20-mer peptides (H3P20) catalyzed by the M3RA and M4RA complexes. For both reactions with 1 μM enzyme, 10 μM H3 peptides, and 250 μM AdoMet, only the monomethylated H3 was observed within 30 min (Fig. S1, B and C). Therefore, we concluded that the rates of product formation during steady-state kinetic measurements reflect only the monomethylation activities of M3RA and M4RA. We then used a continuous enzyme-coupled assay to characterize the steady-state kinetic parameters of M3RA and M4RA. In this assay, the cofactor product AdoHcy is rapidly converted into urate and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in a continuous stepwise enzyme-coupled reaction (Fig. S2). H2O2 subsequently reacts with 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid/4-aminophenazone chromogenic system to yield a compound with absorption at 515 nm (A515) (26Bolhuis P.A. Zwart R. Bär P.R.

Biochem. 2006; 350: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2). In terms of these cascading reactions, the accumulation of product AdoHcy can be calculated using the calibration curve generated from AdoHcy standards (Fig. S3A). For M3RA and M4RA-mediated monomethylation reaction, the steady-state kinetic parameters were determined for AdoMet and H3P20, respectively, at fixed concentrations of the other substrate. Representative Michaelis–Menten plots for velocity as a function of AdoMet or H3P20 were shown in Figure 2, A–D. At 1600 μM concentration of H3P20, the Km value for AdoMet with M3RA is 20.0 ± 1.5 μM, with a kcatAdoMet value at 5.0 ± 0.1 min−1. The Km value for AdoMet with M4RA is 6.9 ± 0.4 μM, with a kcatAdoMet value at 4.8 ± 0.1 min−1. At 200 μM concentration of AdoMet, the Km value for the H3P20 peptide with M3RA is 586.1 ± 60.5 μM, with a kcatH3P20 value at 6.2 ± 0.2 min−1. In comparison, the Km value for the H3P20 peptide with M4RA is approximately 231.7 ± 17.3 μM, which is less than half of that with M3RA. These kinetic parameters indicate that M4RA has higher affinities for both AdoMet and H3P20 peptides. Since M4RA has similar kcatAdoMet and kcatH3P20 as that of M3RA, thereby smaller Km values suggest that M4RA bears higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) than M3RA. Histone methyltransferases are classical bisubstrate enzymes with histone peptides and AdoMet as the two substrates. Bisubstrate reactions can adopt either a ping-pong or a sequential mechanism, and the latter can be further classified into an ordered or a random sequential mechanism (28Marangoni A.G. Enzyme Kinetics: A Modern Approach. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY2003Google Scholar). To investigate the exact kinetic mechanisms of MLL3 and MLL4, we first carried out initial velocity studies using the H3P20 peptide that was varied at different fixed concentrations of AdoMet. The resulting Lineweaver–Burk plots show intersecting line patterns for both the M3RA and M4RA complexes and exhibit a decreasing slope with increasing AdoMet concentrations (Fig. 3, A and C). Similar intersecting lines were also obtained when AdoMet was varied at different fixed H3P20 peptide concentrations (Fig. 3, B and D). These Lineweaver–Burk plots indicate that MLL3 and MLL4 both catalyze a sequential mechanism in which two substrates bind the enzyme to form a ternary complex before the reaction can take place rather than adopting a ping-pong mechanism. Information derived from our initial velocity studies cannot differentiate between the ordered and random sequential mechanisms. Secondary plots were performed to investigate the exact kinetic mechanism. The rate of reaction for a sequential mechanism can be described by Equation 1. For a random sequential mechanism, Equation 1 can be rearranged to Equation 2, in which KsA and KsB are the equilibrium dissociation constants for the binary enzyme–substrate complexes EA and EB, respectively; KAB and KBA are the steady-state Michaelis constants (Km) for the formation of the ternary enzyme–substrate complexes EAB from B to EA and A to EB, respectively, under the assumption of steady state in the concentration of the EAB ternary complex. In Cleland notation (29Cleland W.W. The kinetics of enzyme-catalyzed reactions with two or more substrates or products: I. Nomenclature and rate equations.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 104-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), A refers to AdoMet, B is the unmethylated H3 peptide, and E is the MLL core complex. Alternatively, Equation 1 can be expressed as Equation 7 in the case of an ordered sequential mechanism. Differentiation between ordered sequential and random sequential mechanisms can be achieved by plotting the apparent Michaelis constants K′ and Vmax′ against the concentration of the fixed substrates, as shown by the distinct stimulation curves in Fig. S4 (28Marangoni A.G. Enzyme Kinetics: A Modern Approach. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY2003Google Scholar). The concentrations of each substrate and corresponding Vmax′ and K′ for each secondary plot are listed in Table S1. The kcat, KsA, KsB, KAB, and KBA values obtained through nonlinear regression curve fitting by Equations (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), (14) are reported in Table 1.Table 1Kinetic parameters derived from secondary plotsProteinkcat (min−1)KsA (μM)KsB (μM)KAB (μM)KBA (μM)M3RA6.51 ± 0.474.29 ± 0.44135.72 ± 50.16659.33 ± 45.6627.23 ± 3.05M4RA6.46 ± 0.3210.28 ± 0.46-147.70 ± 12.52-Values reported are the mean ± s.d.In Cleland notation (29Cleland W.W.

Acta. 1963; 67: 104-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), A refers to AdoMet, B is the unmethylated H3 peptide. For M3RA-catalyzed reactions, Vmax′ and K′ both exhibited a hyperbolic dependence on different fixed H3P20 concentrations (Fig. 4A). Similarly, the Vmax′ and K′ also exhibited a hyperbolic dependence on different fixed AdoMet concentrations (Fig. 4B). These hyperbolic patterns reflect the symmetry of the random mechanism, indicating a random sequential mechanism catalyzed by M3RA. The secondary plots showed a distinct pattern for M4RA-catalyzed reactions. Vmax′ displayed a hyperbolic dependence on different fixed H3P20 concentrations, whereas K′ exhibited a decreasing hyperbola curve when the concentration of H3P20 was held at constant (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, K′ displayed a decreasing hyperbola curve, while Vmax′ was roughly kept constant at different fixed concentrations of AdoMet (Fig. 4D). These secondary plot results imply that M4RA may act in an ordered sequential mechanism in a methyl transfer reaction. Additionally, Vmax′ is independent of the concentration of AdoMet, suggesting that AdoMet is the first substrate binding to M4RA in the ordered-sequential reaction. The secondary plot analyses revealed the distinct kinetic mechanisms of MLL3 and MLL4: MLL3 adopts a random sequential mechanism, and MLL4 utilizes an ordered sequential mechanism. These two kinetic mechanisms both have well-established and characteristic dead-end inhibition (see Table S2) (30Purich D.L. Contemporary Enzyme Kinetics and Mechanism. Reliable Lab Solutions, Academic Press, Oxford, UK2009Google Scholar) and product inhibition patterns (see Table S3) (31Leskovac V. Comprehensive Enzyme Kinetics. Springer Science & Business Media, New York, NY2003Google Scholar). Based on that, we carried out these inhibition studies and analyzed our inhibition data to determine which mechanism is best supported by our results. First, we carried out dead-end analogue inhibition studies using two inhibitors: H3P20K4Ac and sinefungin. H3P20K4Ac is almost identical to H3P20 except that the K4 residue is acetylated, so H3P20K4Ac can no longer act as a methyl acceptor. Sinefungin is analogous to the cofactor AdoMet, in which the δ-amine and methylene moieties replace the methyl group and sulfonium cation in AdoMet, respectively. In these inhibition studies, the concentration of one substrate was held constant, while the concentrations of the other substrate and the inhibitors were varied as described in the Experimental procedures. Data were interpreted by both linear and nonlinear analyses. Lineweaver–Burk plots were generated according to the Equation 15 to visualize data and estimated the inhibition patterns. The Lineweaver–Burk plots obtained at different inhibitor concentrations can indicate the mode of inhibition: if the lines converge on the y-axis, it is competitive inhibition; they converge on the x-axis for noncompetitive inhibition; and parallel lines for uncompetitive inhibition (31Leskovac V. Comprehensive Enzyme Kinetics. Springer Science & Business Media, New York, NY2003Google Scholar). For nonlinear analyses, each data set was fit to equations corresponding to competitive (Equation 16), noncompetitive (Equation 17), and uncompetitive (Equation 18) inhibition. Representative nonlinear curves were shown in Fig. S5. Data sets were assessed as best fitting to models based on the best coefficient of determination and the lowest standard errors of the estimate listed in Table S4 to reinforce the conclusions from linear analyses. For M3RA-catalyzed reactions, the results showed that H3P20Ac acted as a competitive inhibitor when the concentration of H3P20 was varied and AdoMet concentration was held constant, indicating that H3P20Ac competes with H3P20 for the same form of M3RA (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the inhibition by H3P20Ac was noncompetitive when AdoMet was the variable substrate (Fig. 5B), indicating that H3P20, as well as its competitive inhibitor H3P20Ac, can bind to the free M3RA and M3RA-AdoMet binary complex indiscriminately. Similarly, sinefungin acted as a competitive inhibitor when AdoMet concentration was variable and as a noncompetitive inhibitor when H3P20 concentration was variable (Fig. 5, C and D), which is in accordance with the symmetry of the random sequential mechanism. Thus, we speculated that there is no particular order in the sequential binding of substrates H3P20 or AdoMet to the M3RA to form the ternary complex, which can be identified as the random sequential mechanism. The same set of experiments on M4RA suggested that H3P20Ac acted as a competitive inhibitor when H3P20 was the variable substrate (Fig. 5E), and sinefungin was competitive when AdoMet was the variable substrate (Fig. 5G). Sinefungin showed a noncompetitive inhibition pattern when H3P20 was the variable substrate (Fig. 5H). However, parallel lines in Figure 5F suggested that H3P20Ac was an uncompetitive inhibitor when AdoMet was the variable substrate, implying that H3P20Ac and its analogue substrate H3P20 only bind to the M4RA-AdoMet binary complex but not M4RA enzyme alone. Taken together, these results are consistent with an ordered sequential mechanism in which AdoMet binds to the enzyme complex first. To further validate the kinetic models and determine the release order of products, we performed product inhibition studies with H3P20me1 (monomethylated on K4) and AdoHcy. For the AdoHcy inhibition experiments, a different MALDI-TOF-based assay was used as described in the Experimental"
https://openalex.org/W3139991325,"Background Early neonatal death caused by preterm birth contributes the most for perinatal death. The prevalence of preterm birth continues to rise and is a significant public health problem. The exact cause of preterm birth is yet unanswered, as mostly preterm birth happens spontaneously. Predictors of preterm birth in developing countries like Ethiopia were not well investigated, and no study was conducted before this in the study area. Objectives To identify predictors of preterm birth in Western Ethiopia, 2017/2018. Methods Health facility-based unmatched case-control study was conducted from October 20/2017-march 20/2018 in 4 Hospitals. A total sample size of 358 women was recruited. From this 72 were cases and 286 were controls. Cases were mothers who gave Preterm birth, and controls were mothers who gave birth at term. Ethical clearance was obtained from Wollega University ethical review committee. A pre tested, structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Data entry and analysis was done using Epi Data 3.1 and SPSS version 21, respectively. Logistic regression was done to identify predictors of preterm birth. Result Three hundred fifty-eight women participated in this study of which 72 were cases and 286 were controls; making the overall response rate of 100%. Lack of antenatal care visit [AOR = 3.18, 95% CI 1.37–7.38]),(Having 1–2 antenatal care visit [AOR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.18–4.35]),history of previous preterm)[AOR = 5.19, 95% CI1.29–20.88],Short Interpregnancy Interval [AOR = 4.41.95% CI 2.05–9.47],Having Reproductive tract infections [AOR = 2.54, 95% CI 1.02–6.32] and having Obstetric complications [AOR = 2.48,95% CI 1.31–4.71] were found to be predictors of preterm birth. Conclusion and recommendation Risk factors of preterm delivery are multifactorial and depend on geographical and demographic features of the population studied. Hence results of studies from one area might not be applicable to another area. Antenatal care visits are unique opportunities for early diagnosis and treatment of problems. Therefore, antenatal care should be strengthened, and appropriate counseling should be given at each antenatal care follow up. Maintainning optimum birth interval through family planning, and early identification and treatment of reproductive tract infections are mandatory."
https://openalex.org/W3146388036,"Adequate diversity and abundance of native seed for large-scale grassland restorations often require commercially produced seed from distant sources. However, as sourcing distance increases, the likelihood of inadvertent introduction of multiple novel, non-native weed species as seed contaminants also increases. We created a model to determine an “optimal maximum distance” that would maximize availability of native prairie seed from commercial sources while minimizing the risk of novel invasive weeds via contamination. The model focused on the central portion of the Level II temperate prairie ecoregion in the Midwest US. The median optimal maximum distance from which to source seed was 272 km (169 miles). In addition, we weighted the model to address potential concerns from restoration practitioners: 1. sourcing seed via a facilitated migration strategy (i.e., direct movement of species from areas south of a given restoration site to assist species’ range expansion) to account for warming due to climate change; and 2. emphasizing non-native, exotic species with a federal mandate to control. Weighting the model for climate change increased the median optimal maximum distance to 398 km (247 miles), but this was not statistically different from the distance calculated without taking sourcing for climate adaptation into account. Weighting the model for federally mandated exotic species increased the median optimal maximum distance only slightly to 293 km (182 miles), so practitioners may not need to adjust their sourcing strategy, compared to the original model. This decision framework highlights some potential inadvertent consequences from species translocations and provides insight on how to balance needs for prairie seed against those risks."

https://openalex.org/W3144514478,"Several studies have suggested that sympathetic overstimulation causes deleterious effects in septic shock. A previous study suggested that pralidoxime exerted a pressor effect through a mechanism unrelated to the sympathetic nervous system; this effect was buffered by the vasodepressor action of pralidoxime mediated through sympathoinhibition. In this study, we explored the effects of pralidoxime on hemodynamics and survival in rats with peritonitis-induced sepsis. This study consisted of two sub-studies: survival and hemodynamic studies. In the survival study, 66 rats, which survived for 10 hours after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), randomly received saline placebo, pralidoxime, or norepinephrine treatment and were monitored for up to 24 hours. In the hemodynamic study, 44 rats were randomly assigned to sham, CLP-saline placebo, CLP-pralidoxime, or CLP-norepinephrine groups, and hemodynamic measurements were performed using a conductance catheter placed in the left ventricle. In the survival study, 6 (27.2%), 15 (68.1%), and 5 (22.7%) animals survived the entire 24-hour monitoring period in the saline, pralidoxime, and norepinephrine groups, respectively (log-rank test P = 0.006). In the hemodynamic study, pralidoxime but not norepinephrine increased end-diastolic volume (P &lt;0.001), stroke volume (P = 0.002), cardiac output (P = 0.003), mean arterial pressure (P = 0.041), and stroke work (P &lt;0.001). The pressor effect of norepinephrine was short-lived, such that by 60 minutes after the initiation of norepinephrine infusion, it no longer had any significant effect on mean arterial pressure. In addition, norepinephrine significantly increased heart rate (P &lt;0.001) and the ratio of arterial elastance to ventricular end-systolic elastance (P = 0.010), but pralidoxime did not. In conclusion, pralidoxime improved the hemodynamics and 24-hour survival rate in rats with peritonitis-induced sepsis, but norepinephrine did not."
https://openalex.org/W3147230777,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is an age-dependent blood malignancy. Like many other age-dependent human diseases, laboratory animal research of CML uses young mice that do not factor in the influence of aging. To understand how aging may impact animal modeling of human age-dependent diseases, we established the first aging mouse model of human CML in BALB/c mice in the advanced age defined by 75% survival. This model was developed by noncytotoxic depletion of bone marrow lineage-positive cells followed by BCR-ABL retroviral transduction and transplantation. CML developed in aging mice shared many similarities to that in young mice, but had increased incidence of anemia that is often seen in human CML. Importantly, we showed that aging of both donor hematopoietic stem cells and recipient bone marrow niche impacted BCR-ABL mediated leukemogenesis and leukemia spectrum. Optimal CML induction relied on age-matching for donors and recipients, and cross-transplantation between young and old mice produced a mixture of different leukemia. Therefore, our model provides initial evidence of the feasibility and merit of CML modeling in aging mice and offers a new tool for future studies of CML stem cell drug resistance and therapeutic intervention in which aging would be taken into consideration as an influencing factor."
https://openalex.org/W3148151652,"T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule-3 (Tim-3) has been described as a transmembrane protein, expressed on the surface of various T cells as well as different cells of innate immunity. It has since been associated with Th1 mediated autoimmune diseases and transplantation tolerance studies, thereby indicating a possible role of this receptor in counter-regulation of Th2 immune responses. In the present study we therefore directly examined the role of Tim-3 in allergic inflammation and respiratory tolerance. First, Tim-3 -/- mice and wild type controls were immunized and challenged with the model allergen ovalbumin (OVA) to induce an asthma-like phenotype. Analysis of cell numbers and distribution in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid as well as lung histology in H&amp;E stained lung sections demonstrated a comparable degree of eosinophilic inflammation in both mouse strains. Th2 cytokine production in restimulated cell culture supernatants and serum IgE and IgG levels were equally increased in both genotypes. In addition, cell proliferation and the distribution of different T cell subsets were comparable. Moreover, analysis of both mouse strains in our respiratory tolerance model, where mucosal application of the model allergen before immunization, prevents the development of an asthma-like phenotype, revealed no differences in any of the parameters mentioned above. The current study demonstrates that Tim-3 is dispensable not only for the development of allergic inflammation but also for induction of respiratory tolerance in mice in an OVA-based model."
https://openalex.org/W3152183665,"Germline mutations in CDKN2A, encoding the tumor suppressor p16, are responsible for a large proportion of familial melanoma cases and also increase risk of pancreatic cancer. We identified four families through pancreatic cancer probands that were affected by both cancers. These families bore a germline missense variant of CDKN2A (47T>G), encoding a p16-L16R mutant protein associated with high cancer occurrence. Here, we investigated the biological significance of this variant. When transfected into p16-null pancreatic cancer cells, p16-L16R was expressed at lower levels than wild-type (WT) p16. In addition, p16-L16R was unable to bind CDK4 or CDK6 compared with WT p16, as shown by coimmunoprecipitation assays and also was impaired in its ability to inhibit the cell cycle, as demonstrated by flow cytometry analyses. In silico molecular modeling predicted that the L16R mutation prevents normal protein folding, consistent with the observed reduction in expression/stability and diminished function of this mutant protein. We isolated normal dermal fibroblasts from members of the families expressing WT or L16R proteins to investigate the impact of endogenous p16-L16R mutant protein on cell growth. In culture, p16-L16R fibroblasts grew at a faster rate, and most survived until later passages than p16-WT fibroblasts. Further, western blotting demonstrated that p16 protein was detected at lower levels in p16-L16R than in p16-WT fibroblasts. Together, these results suggest that the presence of a CDKN2A (47T>G) mutant allele contributes to an increased risk of pancreatic cancer as a result of reduced p16 protein levels and diminished p16 tumor suppressor function."
https://openalex.org/W3143425064,"Background Despite the prevalence and impact of delirium, its pathophysiology remains unclear. In order to advance this field of research, robust scientific methodology is required, yet quality of reporting in this field of research has been highly inconsistent. Delirium biomarker research poses several challenges, none of which have been documented in the literature before. The aim of this study was to explore the perspectives of delirium researchers about key methodological issues in delirium biomarker research. Methods Following a Delphi study with delirium experts resulting in 60 recommendations for reporting delirium biomarker studies, semi-structured interviews with international delirium researchers were conducted. Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim, followed by thematic analysis of the qualitative data. Results Fifteen participants were interviewed between August and November 2019. Most were male (n = 12; 75%), clinician researchers (n = 13; 86%), and had more than ten years’ experience in conducting delirium research (n = 9; 60%). Analysis revealed two major themes and ten sub-themes, outlining key considerations to advance the field of delirium biomarker research. The major themes were: 1) Practical and scientific challenges of delirium biomarker research: stagnation versus driving improved methods and reporting; and 2) Valuing delirium research through investment and collaboration. Conclusion Findings identified a range of factors that contribute to the practical and ethical challenges of conducting delirium biomarker research, which have not previously been explicitly acknowledged or reported. A clear vision for collaborative efforts to enhance research quality for improved impact was also presented by the delirium researchers. This work complements the preceding Delphi and together these studies provide an in-depth understanding of what is needed in the field to inform and improve methods and reporting of delirium biomarker research."
https://openalex.org/W3143439919,"Phasic dopamine release from mid-brain dopaminergic neurons is thought to signal errors of reward prediction (RPE). If reward maximisation is to maintain homeostasis, then the value of primary rewards should be coupled to the homeostatic errors they remediate. This leads to the prediction that RPE signals should be configured as a function of homeostatic state and thus diminish with the attenuation of homeostatic error. To test this hypothesis, we collected a large volume of functional MRI data from five human volunteers on four separate days. After fasting for 12 hours, subjects consumed preloads that differed in glucose concentration. Participants then underwent a Pavlovian cue-conditioning paradigm in which the colour of a fixation-cross was stochastically associated with the delivery of water or glucose via a gustometer. This design afforded computation of RPE separately for better- and worse-than expected outcomes during ascending and descending trajectories of serum glucose fluctuations. In the parabrachial nuclei, regional activity coding positive RPEs scaled positively with serum glucose for both ascending and descending glucose levels. The ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra became more sensitive to negative RPEs when glucose levels were ascending. Together, the results suggest that RPE signals in key brainstem structures are modulated by homeostatic trajectories of naturally occurring glycaemic flux, revealing a tight interplay between homeostatic state and the neural encoding of primary reward in the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W3145276372,"NG2 immunoreactive cells (NG2 cells) are found in the brain and peripheral tissues including the skin, intestinal tracts, and bladder. In a previous study, we observed the presence of NG2 cells in the stomach using bioluminescence imaging techniques in NG2-firefly luciferase (fLuc) transgenic (Tg) rats. Here, we aimed to identify and characterize NG2 cells in the adult rat stomach. Immunohistochemical studies showed that NG2 cells were mainly present in the lamina propria and most of the cells were gastric telocytes, co-expressing CD34, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), with a small oval-shaped cell body and extremely long and thin cellular prolongations. In the rat stomach, NG2-expressing telocytes comprised two subpopulations: NG2+/CD34+/PDGFRα+ and NG2+/CD34+/PDGFRα-. Furthermore, we showed that the expression of NG2 gene in the aged rat stomach decreased relative to that of the young rat stomach and the decline of NG2 expression in aged rats was mainly observed in NG2+/CD34+/PDGFRα+ telocytes. These findings suggested age-related alterations in NG2+/CD34+/PDGFRα+ telocytes of rat stomach."

Traditional relay protection and fault diagnosis technologies have been unable to meet the requirements of the continuous development of power systems, and relay protection systems based on artificial intelligence(AI) technology have received increasing attention. Therefore, this document first analyses the weaknesses of traditional broadcast line protection and uses the adaptability and self-learning of artificial intelligence(AI); to propose the concept of protection of a relay line based on AI. In combination with the artificial nervous network, the AI-based relay protection system shall be studied and the experimental model shall be developed. This paper validates it with simulation experiments. The research results show that for the analysis of the ANN test results of the subnetwork, the actual output of the subnetwork is very close to the ideal output, and the error does not exceed 0.2%. The system has good performance and high reliability."
https://openalex.org/W3148209622,"To obtain market average return, investment managers need to construct index tracking portfolio to replicate target index. Currently, most literatures use financial data that has homogenous frequency when constructing the index tracking portfolio. To make up for this limitation, we propose a methodology based on mixed-frequency financial data, called FACTOR-MIDAS-POET model. The proposed model can utilize the intraday return data, daily risk factors data and monthly or quarterly macro economy data, simultaneously. Meanwhile, the out-of-sample analysis demonstrates that our model can improve the tracking accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3150383168,"Binary Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) is the most common method used by researchers to analyze clustered binary data in biological and social sciences. The traditional approach to GLMMs causes substantial bias in estimates due to steady shape of logistic and normal distribution assumptions thereby resulting into wrong and misleading decisions. This study brings forward an approach governed by skew generalized t distributions that belong to a class of potentially skewed and heavy tailed distributions. Interestingly, both the traditional logistic and probit mixed models, as well as other available methods can be utilized within the skew generalized t-link model (SGTLM) frame. We have taken advantage of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm accelerated via parameter-expansion for model fitting. We evaluated the performance of this approach to GLMMs through a simulation experiment by varying sample size and data distribution. Our findings indicated that the proposed methodology outperforms competing approaches in estimating population parameters and predicting random effects, when the traditional link and normality assumptions are violated. In addition, empirical standard errors and information criteria proved useful for detecting spurious skewness and avoiding complex models for probit data. An application with respiratory infection data points out to the superiority of the SGTLM which turns to be the most adequate model. In future, studies should focus on integrating the demonstrated flexibility in other generalized linear mixed models to enhance robust modeling."
https://openalex.org/W3144460135,"Introduction Little is known about the accuracy of societal publications (e.g. press releases, internet postings or professional journals) that are based on scientific work. This study investigates a) inconsistencies between scientific peer-reviewed health services research (HSR) publications and non-scientific societal publications and b) replication of reporting inadequacies from these scientific publications to corresponding societal publications. Methods A sample of HSR publications was drawn from 116 publications authored in 2016 by thirteen Dutch HSR institutions. Societal publications corresponding to scientific publications were identified through a systematic internet search. We conducted a qualitative, directed content analysis on societal publications derived from the scientific publications to assess both reporting inadequacies and determine inconsistencies. Descriptive frequencies were calculated for all variables. Odds ratios were used to investigate whether inconsistencies in societal publications were less likely when the first scientific author was involved. Results We identified 43 scientific and 156 societal publications. 94 societal publications (60.3%), (associated with 32 scientific publications (74.4%)) contained messages that were inconsistent with the scientific work. We found reporting inadequacies in 22 scientific publications (51.2%). In 45 societal publications (28.9%), we found replications of these reporting inadequacies. The likelihood of inconsistencies between scientific and societal publications did not differ when the latter explicitly involved the first scientific author, (OR = 1.44, CI: 0.76–2.74); were published on the institute’s or funder’s website, (OR = 1.32, CI: 0.57–3.06); published with no involvement of a scientific author, (OR = 0.52, CI: 0.25–1.07). Conclusion To improve societal publications, one should examine both the consistency with scientific research publications and ways to prevent replication of scientific reporting inadequacies. HSR institutions, funders, and scientific and societal publication platforms should invest in a supportive publication culture to further incentivise the responsible and skilled involvement of researchers in writing both scientific and societal publications."
https://openalex.org/W3150552018,"Background HIV-positive persons of African descent are disproportionately affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD). Deterioration to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) also occurs in this population at a higher frequency. There remains a lot to learn about the genetic susceptibility to CKD in HIV positive patients, and the pathophysiology of progression to ESKD. Objectives We will conduct an exploratory genotype-phenotype study in HIV-positive persons with CKD in Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Nigeria, to determine blood-based differential gene expression biomarkers in different kidney risk groups according to the KDIGO 2012 criteria. Methods We will consecutively screen 150 HIV-positive adults (≥18 years of age) attending the HIV clinic of Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Kano, Nigeria, for CKD based on proteinuria and elevation of estimated glomerular filtration rate. Among these, two separate groups of 16 eligible participants each (n = 32) will be selected in the four (4) KDIGO 2012 kidney risk categories. The groups will be matched for age, sex, viral suppression level and antiretroviral (ARV) regimen. In the first group (n = 16), we will determine differential gene expression markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using mRNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq). We will validate the differential expression markers in the second group (n = 16) using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Using a systems-based approach, we will construct, visualize and analyze gene-gene interaction networks to determine the potential biological roles of identified differential expression markers based on published literature and publicly available databases. Results Our exploratory study will provide valuable information on the potential roles of differential expression biomarkers in the pathophysiology of HIV-associated kidney disease by identifying novel biomarkers in different risk categories of CKD in a sub-Saharan African population. The results of this study will provide the basis for population-based genome-wide association studies to guide future personalized medicine approaches. Conclusion Validated biomarkers can be potential targets for the development of stage-specific therapeutic interventions, an essential paradigm in precision medicine."
https://openalex.org/W3151144295,"We introduce a new experimental approach to measuring the effects of health insurance policy alternatives on behavior and health outcomes over the life course. In a virtual environment with multi-period lives, subjects earn virtual income and allocate spending, to maximize utility, which is converted into cash payment. We compare behavior across age, income and insurance plans—one priced according to an individual’s expected cost and the other uniformly priced through employer-implemented cost sharing. We find that 1) subjects in the employer-implemented plan purchased insurance at higher rates; 2) the employer-based plan reduced differences due to income and age; 3) subjects in the actuarial plan engaged in more health-promoting behaviors, but still below optimal levels, and did save at the level required, so did realize the full benefits of the plan. Subjects had more difficulty optimizing choices in the Actuarial treatment, because it required more long term planning and evaluating benefits that compounded over time. Contrary, to model predictions, the actuarial priced insurance plan did not increase utility relative to the employer-based plan."
