https://openalex.org/W2055344468,"The number of eggs laid by the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma varies with host volume. The duration of the wasp's initial transit across the host surface during host examination is used to determine the number of eggs laid. A 2.5-second reduction in initial transit resulted in a 30% reduction in eggs oviposited, demonstrating that these wasps measure short time intervals. This measure is used for progeny allocation independent of host body size."

This discrepancy may have strong implications for the physics of gravitation. To test whether similar results can be observed in a different geological environment, gravity measurements in a Michigan borehole have been examined. Although these results cannot be taken as conclusive, owing to the large uncertainties involved in mass determination on a geophysical scale, these measurements are generally consistent with those of the Australian experiment."

https://openalex.org/W1993286056,"Although In our geological textbooks the undertow has been described as a well known phenomenon, some doubts have been expressed In recent years as to Its reality. This question was first raised by Professor W. M. Davis In 1925 as the result of some observations made by him along the Florida coast. A few years later independent investigations regarding the existence of the undertow were made by Dr. F. P. Shepard and by the writer. Dr. Shepard believes that the undertow, as a current of sufficient velocity to be dangerous to swimmers, Is non-exiatent and that the water carried shoreward by the Incoming waves moves out again in localized currents at the surface."
