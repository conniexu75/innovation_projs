https://openalex.org/W2144275312,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the Western world. Twenty per cent of NAFLD individuals develop chronic hepatic inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH) associated with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, yet the causes of progression from NAFLD to NASH remain obscure. Here, we show that the NLRP6 and NLRP3 inflammasomes and the effector protein IL-18 negatively regulate NAFLD/NASH progression, as well as multiple aspects of metabolic syndrome via modulation of the gut microbiota. Different mouse models reveal that inflammasome-deficiency-associated changes in the configuration of the gut microbiota are associated with exacerbated hepatic steatosis and inflammation through influx of TLR4 and TLR9 agonists into the portal circulation, leading to enhanced hepatic tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression that drives NASH progression. Furthermore, co-housing of inflammasome-deficient mice with wild-type mice results in exacerbation of hepatic steatosis and obesity. Thus, altered interactions between the gut microbiota and the host, produced by defective NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasome sensing, may govern the rate of progression of multiple metabolic syndrome-associated abnormalities, highlighting the central role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of heretofore seemingly unrelated systemic auto-inflammatory and metabolic disorders. An expansion of Porphyromonadaceae in the gut is linked to the pathogenesis and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in the mouse. Using a mouse model, Richard Flavell and co-workers study the inflammatory processes associated with progression from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease — the leading cause of chronic liver disease in developed countries — to the more severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which often leads to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. They find that alterations of the intestinal microbiota associated with the NLRP6 and NLRP3 inflammasomes enhance disease in mice with diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver syndrome. These findings highlight the pivotal role of the microbiota in the development of autoinflammatory and metabolic disorders, and point to the manipulation of host–microflora interactions as a focus for new therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2100898201,"Demonstration of an optomechanical system that works as a quantum interface between light and micro-mechanical motion. The possibility of controlling the quantum states of micro- and nanomechanical oscillators has been of great interest in recent years. Although various mechanical resonators have been cooled to their quantum ground state, there are few reports of experiments in which this quantum regime is further explored and used, for example, to exchange quantum information. Previously, quantum coupling between mechanical degrees of freedom and microwave radiation has been shown. Now, Verhagen et al. demonstrate an optomechanical system, cooled by radiation pressure, that works as a quantum interface between a mechanical oscillator and optical photons, offering the advantage that standard optical fibres can be used to extract the quantum information. Optical laser fields have been widely used to achieve quantum control over the motional and internal degrees of freedom of atoms and ions1,2, molecules and atomic gases. A route to controlling the quantum states of macroscopic mechanical oscillators in a similar fashion is to exploit the parametric coupling between optical and mechanical degrees of freedom through radiation pressure in suitably engineered optical cavities3,4,5,6. If the optomechanical coupling is ‘quantum coherent’—that is, if the coherent coupling rate exceeds both the optical and the mechanical decoherence rate—quantum states are transferred from the optical field to the mechanical oscillator and vice versa. This transfer allows control of the mechanical oscillator state using the wide range of available quantum optical techniques. So far, however, quantum-coherent coupling of micromechanical oscillators has only been achieved using microwave fields at millikelvin temperatures7,8. Optical experiments have not attained this regime owing to the large mechanical decoherence rates9 and the difficulty of overcoming optical dissipation10. Here we achieve quantum-coherent coupling between optical photons and a micromechanical oscillator. Simultaneously, coupling to the cold photon bath cools the mechanical oscillator to an average occupancy of 1.7 ± 0.1 motional quanta. Excitation with weak classical light pulses reveals the exchange of energy between the optical light field and the micromechanical oscillator in the time domain at the level of less than one quantum on average. This optomechanical system establishes an efficient quantum interface between mechanical oscillators and optical photons, which can provide decoherence-free transport of quantum states through optical fibres. Our results offer a route towards the use of mechanical oscillators as quantum transducers or in microwave-to-optical quantum links11,12,13,14,15."

https://openalex.org/W2013785611,"Transcription factors and chromatin modifiers are important in the programming and reprogramming of cellular states during development. Transcription factors bind to enhancer elements and recruit coactivators and chromatin-modifying enzymes to facilitate transcription initiation. During differentiation a subset of these enhancers must be silenced, but the mechanisms underlying enhancer silencing are poorly understood. Here we show that the histone demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1; ref. 5), which demethylates histone H3 on Lys 4 or Lys 9 (H3K4/K9), is essential in decommissioning enhancers during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). LSD1 occupies enhancers of active genes that are critical for control of the state of ESCs. However, LSD1 is not essential for the maintenance of ESC identity. Instead, ESCs lacking LSD1 activity fail to differentiate fully, and ESC-specific enhancers fail to undergo the histone demethylation events associated with differentiation. At active enhancers, LSD1 is a component of the NuRD (nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylase) complex, which contains additional subunits that are necessary for ESC differentiation. We propose that the LSD1-NuRD complex decommissions enhancers of the pluripotency program during differentiation, which is essential for the complete shutdown of the ESC gene expression program and the transition to new cell states."
https://openalex.org/W2116059612,"Quantum computers could be used to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers, but are challenging to build because of their increased susceptibility to errors. However, it is possible to detect and correct errors without destroying coherence, by using quantum error correcting codes. The simplest of these are three-quantum-bit (three-qubit) codes, which map a one-qubit state to an entangled three-qubit state; they can correct any single phase-flip or bit-flip error on one of the three qubits, depending on the code used. Here we demonstrate such phase- and bit-flip error correcting codes in a superconducting circuit. We encode a quantum state, induce errors on the qubits and decode the error syndrome--a quantum state indicating which error has occurred--by reversing the encoding process. This syndrome is then used as the input to a three-qubit gate that corrects the primary qubit if it was flipped. As the code can recover from a single error on any qubit, the fidelity of this process should decrease only quadratically with error probability. We implement the correcting three-qubit gate (known as a conditional-conditional NOT, or Toffoli, gate) in 63 nanoseconds, using an interaction with the third excited state of a single qubit. We find 85 ± 1 per cent fidelity to the expected classical action of this gate, and 78 ± 1 per cent fidelity to the ideal quantum process matrix. Using this gate, we perform a single pass of both quantum bit- and phase-flip error correction and demonstrate the predicted first-order insensitivity to errors. Concatenation of these two codes in a nine-qubit device would correct arbitrary single-qubit errors. In combination with recent advances in superconducting qubit coherence times, this could lead to scalable quantum technology."
https://openalex.org/W2097306134,"Spider web deformation simulations, theory and experiments reveal how the nonlinear response of spider silk to strain and the discrete geometry of a web contribute to its robustness, integrity and performance. Spider silk is one of nature's 'super-materials'. Its remarkable mechanical properties include high extensibility and strength comparable to that of steel. But Markus Buehler and colleagues show that it is not just these virtues that make silk ideal for web construction. Silk's nonlinear stress response — linear at low strain, suddenly softening as strain increases then stiffening prior to failure — is also critical. This behaviour allows webs to keep their shape when experiencing small, distributed loads such as those exerted by wind. But during strong local deformations, such as those caused by falling debris, the geometrical arrangement of the threads and the nonlinear stress response combine to limit damage to the area near the impact site, so that the web remains functional. Natural materials are renowned for exquisite designs that optimize function, as illustrated by the elasticity of blood vessels, the toughness of bone and the protection offered by nacre1,2,3,4,5. Particularly intriguing are spider silks, with studies having explored properties ranging from their protein sequence6 to the geometry of a web7. This material system8, highly adapted to meet a spider’s many needs, has superior mechanical properties9,10,11,12,13,14,15. In spite of much research into the molecular design underpinning the outstanding performance of silk fibres1,6,10,13,16,17, and into the mechanical characteristics of web-like structures18,19,20,21, it remains unknown how the mechanical characteristics of spider silk contribute to the integrity and performance of a spider web. Here we report web deformation experiments and simulations that identify the nonlinear response of silk threads to stress—involving softening at a yield point and substantial stiffening at large strain until failure—as being crucial to localize load-induced deformation and resulting in mechanically robust spider webs. Control simulations confirmed that a nonlinear stress response results in superior resistance to structural defects in the web compared to linear elastic or elastic–plastic (softening) material behaviour. We also show that under distributed loads, such as those exerted by wind, the stiff behaviour of silk under small deformation, before the yield point, is essential in maintaining the web’s structural integrity. The superior performance of silk in webs is therefore not due merely to its exceptional ultimate strength and strain, but arises from the nonlinear response of silk threads to strain and their geometrical arrangement in a web."
https://openalex.org/W2011516454,"The development of the optical frequency comb (a spectrum consisting of a series of evenly spaced lines) has revolutionized metrology and precision spectroscopy owing to its ability to provide a precise and direct link between microwave and optical frequencies. A further advance in frequency comb technology is the generation of frequency combs in the extreme-ultraviolet spectral range by means of high-harmonic generation in a femtosecond enhancement cavity. Until now, combs produced by this method have lacked sufficient power for applications, a drawback that has also hampered efforts to observe phase coherence of the high-repetition-rate pulse train produced by high-harmonic generation, which is an extremely nonlinear process. Here we report the generation of extreme-ultraviolet frequency combs, reaching wavelengths of 40 nanometres, by coupling a high-power near-infrared frequency comb to a robust femtosecond enhancement cavity. These combs are powerful enough for us to observe single-photon spectroscopy signals for both an argon transition at 82 nanometres and a neon transition at 63 nanometres, thus confirming the combs' coherence in the extreme ultraviolet. The absolute frequency of the argon transition has been determined by direct frequency comb spectroscopy. The resolved ten-megahertz linewidth of the transition, which is limited by the temperature of the argon atoms, is unprecedented in this spectral region and places a stringent upper limit on the linewidth of individual comb teeth. Owing to the lack of continuous-wave lasers, extreme-ultraviolet frequency combs are at present the only promising route to extending ultrahigh-precision spectroscopy to the spectral region below 100 nanometres. At such wavelengths there is a wide range of applications, including the spectroscopy of electronic transitions in molecules, experimental tests of bound-state and many-body quantum electrodynamics in singly ionized helium and neutral helium, the development of next-generation 'nuclear' clocks and searches for variation of fundamental constants using the enhanced sensitivity of highly charged ions."
https://openalex.org/W2078547505,"A study of pre-eruptive magmatic processes at a caldera volcano shows that, although such a volcano may have been dormant for a long period, its magma reserves may be replenished in a comparatively very short time and it may move rapidly from a quiescent state to one on the verge of eruption. Timothy Druitt and co-authors have studied pre-eruptive magmatic processes and their timescales using chemically zoned crystals from the late-1600s BC 'Minoan' caldera-forming eruption on the island of Santorini, Greece. Despite the large volume of erupted magma and the 18,000-year gestation period between the Minoan and the previous major eruption, recharge of the magma reservoir seems to have occurred during the century before eruption, and mixing between different magma batches was still taking place during the final months. These observations have implications for monitoring strategies at long-dormant but potentially active caldera systems, such as Long Valley in California, Yellowstone in Wyoming and Campi Flegrei in Italy. Caldera-forming volcanic eruptions are low-frequency, high-impact events capable of discharging tens to thousands of cubic kilometres of magma explosively on timescales of hours to days, with devastating effects on local and global scales1. Because no such eruption has been monitored during its long build-up phase, the precursor phenomena are not well understood. Geophysical signals obtained during recent episodes of unrest at calderas such as Yellowstone, USA, and Campi Flegrei, Italy, are difficult to interpret, and the conditions necessary for large eruptions are poorly constrained2,3. Here we present a study of pre-eruptive magmatic processes and their timescales using chemically zoned crystals from the ‘Minoan’ caldera-forming eruption of Santorini volcano, Greece4, which occurred in the late 1600s bc. The results provide insights into how rapidly large silicic systems may pass from a quiescent state to one on the edge of eruption5,6. Despite the large volume of erupted magma4 (40–60 cubic kilometres), and the 18,000-year gestation period between the Minoan eruption and the previous major eruption, most crystals in the Minoan magma record processes that occurred less than about 100 years before the eruption. Recharge of the magma reservoir by large volumes of silicic magma (and some mafic magma) occurred during the century before eruption, and mixing between different silicic magma batches was still taking place during the final months. Final assembly of large silicic magma reservoirs may occur on timescales that are geologically very short by comparison with the preceding repose period, with major growth phases immediately before eruption. These observations have implications for the monitoring of long-dormant, but potentially active, caldera systems."
https://openalex.org/W2116407404,"Substantial evidence suggests that the presence of inflammatory cells plays a critical role in the development and/or progression of human tumors. Neutrophils are the common inflammatory cells in tumors; however, the infiltration of intratumoral neutrophils in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and its effect on CRC patients' prognosis are poorly understood.In this study, the methods of tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to investigate the prognostic significance of intratumoral CD66b+ neutrophil in CRC. According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the cutoff score for high intratumoral CD66b+ neutrophil in CRC was defined when the mean counts were more than 60 per TMA spot. In our study, high intratumoral CD66b+ neutrophil was observed in 104/229 (45.4%) of CRCs and in 29/229 (12.7%) of adjacent mucosal tissues. Further correlation analysis showed that high intratumoral neutrophil was positively correlated with pT status, pM status and clinical stage (P<0.05). In univariate survival analysis, a significant association between high intratumoral neutrophil and shortened patients' survival was found (P<0.0001). In different subsets of CRC patients, intratumoral neutrophil was also a prognostic indicator in patients with stage II, stage III, grade 2, grade 3, pT1, pT2, pN0 and pN1 (P<0.05). Importantly, high intratumoral neutrophil was evaluated as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (P<0.05).Our results provide evidence that increased intratumoral neutrophil in CRC may be important in the acquisition of a malignant phenotype, indicating that the presence of intratumoral neutrophil is an independent factor for poor prognosis of patients with CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2087790911,"Background In view of the reduced number of hours devoted to sleep in modern western societies the question arises what effects might result from sleep duration on occurrence of chronic diseases. Methods Data from 23 620 middle-aged participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study, that were recruited between 1994–1998, were analyzed by using Cox proportional hazard regression to examine the association between self-reported sleep duration at baseline and incidence of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cancer. Results During a mean follow-up period of 7.8 years 841 incident cases of type 2 diabetes, 197 cases of myocardial infarction, 169 incident strokes, and 846 tumor cases were observed. Compared to persons sleeping 7-<8 h/day, participants with sleep duration of <6 h had a significantly increased risk of stroke (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18–3.59), cancer (HR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.09–1.87), and overall chronic diseases (HR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.10–1.55) in multivariable adjusted models. Self-reported daytime sleep at baseline was not associated with incident chronic diseases in the overall study sample. However, there had been an effect modification of daytime sleep by hypertension showing that daytime sleep was inversely related to chronic disease risk among non-hypertensive participants but directly related to chronic diseases among hypertensives. Conclusion Sleep duration of less than 6 h is a risky behavior for the development of chronic diseases, particularly stroke and cancer, and should be therefore addressed in public health campaigns."
https://openalex.org/W2093459949,"Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. However, postmortem evidence indicates that the pathology of lower brainstem regions, such as the pons and medulla, precedes nigral involvement. Consistently, pontomedullary damage was implicated by structural and PET imaging in early PD. Neurochemical correlates of this early pathological involvement in PD are unknown.To map biochemical alterations in the brains of individuals with mild-moderate PD we quantified neurochemical profiles of the pons, putamen and substantia nigra by 7 tesla (T) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Thirteen individuals with idiopathic PD (Hoehn & Yahr stage 2) and 12 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers participated in the study. γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations in the pons and putamen were significantly higher in patients (N = 11, off medications) than controls (N = 11, p<0.001 for pons and p<0.05 for putamen). The GABA elevation was more pronounced in the pons (64%) than in the putamen (32%). No other neurochemical differences were observed between patients and controls.The GABA elevation in the putamen is consistent with prior postmortem findings in patients with PD, as well as with in vivo observations in a rodent model of PD, while the GABA finding in the pons is novel. The more significant GABA elevation in the pons relative to the putamen is consistent with earlier pathological involvement of the lower brainstem. This study provides in vivo evidence for an alteration in the GABAergic tone in the lower brainstem and striatum in early-moderate PD, which may underlie disease pathogenesis and may provide a biomarker for disease staging."
https://openalex.org/W2051599572,"Background The association between overtime work and depression is still unclear. This study examined the association between overtime work and the onset of a major depressive episode (MDE). Methodology/Principal Findings Prospective cohort study with a baseline examination of working hours, psychological morbidity (an indicator of baseline depression) and depression risk factors in 1991–1993 and a follow-up of major depressive episode in 1997–1999 (mean follow-up 5.8 years) among British civil servants (the Whitehall II study; 1626 men, 497 women, mean age 47 years at baseline). Onset of 12-month MDE was assessed by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) at follow-up. In prospective analysis of participants with no psychological morbidity at baseline, the odds ratio for a subsequent major depressive episode was 2.43 (95% confidence interval 1.11 to 5.30) times higher for those working 11+ hours a day compared to employees working 7–8 hours a day, when adjusted for socio-demographic factors at baseline. Further adjustment for chronic physical disease, smoking, alcohol use, job strain and work-related social support had little effect on this association (odds ratio 2.52; 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 5.65). Conclusions/Significance Data from middle-aged civil servants suggest that working long hours of overtime may predispose to major depressive episodes."
https://openalex.org/W2125443638,"Background & Aims Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) involves steatosis combined with inflammation, which can progress into fibrosis and cirrhosis. Exploring the molecular mechanisms of NASH is highly dependent on the availability of animal models. Currently, the most commonly used animal models for NASH imitate particularly late stages of human disease. Thus, there is a need for an animal model that can be used for investigating the factors that potentiate the inflammatory response within NASH. We have previously shown that 7-day high-fat-high-cholesterol (HFC) feeding induces steatosis and inflammation in both APOE2ki and Ldlr−/− mice. However, it is not known whether the early inflammatory response observed in these mice will sustain over time and lead to liver damage. We hypothesized that the inflammatory response in both models is sufficient to induce liver damage over time. Methods APOE2ki and Ldlr−/− mice were fed a chow or HFC diet for 3 months. C57Bl6/J mice were used as control. Results Surprisingly, hepatic inflammation was abolished in APOE2ki mice, while it was sustained in Ldlr−/− mice. In addition, increased apoptosis and hepatic fibrosis was only demonstrated in Ldlr−/− mice. Finally, bone-marrow-derived-macrophages of Ldlr−/− mice showed an increased inflammatory response after oxidized LDL (oxLDL) loading compared to APOE2ki mice. Conclusion Ldlr−/− mice, but not APOE2ki mice, developed sustained hepatic inflammation and liver damage upon long term HFC feeding due to increased sensitivity for oxLDL uptake. Therefore, the Ldlr−/− mice are a promising physiological model particularly vulnerable for investigating the onset of hepatic inflammation in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis."
https://openalex.org/W2148794854,"Colour sidedness is a dominantly inherited phenotype of cattle characterized by the polarization of pigmented sectors on the flanks, snout and ear tips1. It is also referred to as ‘lineback’ or ‘witrik’ (which means white back), as colour-sided animals typically display a white band along their spine. Colour sidedness is documented at least since the Middle Ages and is presently segregating in several cattle breeds around the globe, including in Belgian blue and brown Swiss1,2. Here we report that colour sidedness is determined by a first allele on chromosome 29 (Cs29 ), which results from the translocation of a 492-kilobase chromosome 6 segment encompassing KIT to chromosome 29, and a second allele on chromosome 6 (Cs6 ), derived from the first by repatriation of fused 575-kilobase chromosome 6 and 29 sequences to the KIT locus. We provide evidence that both translocation events involved circular intermediates. This is the first example, to our knowledge, of a phenotype determined by homologous yet non-syntenic alleles that result from a novel copy-number-variant-generating mechanism."

In this study, we established a mouse dental pulp stem cell line (SP) comprised of enriched side population cells that displayed a multipotent capacity to differentiate into odontogenic, osteogenic, adipogenic, and neurogenic cells. We also analyzed the interactions between SP cells and cells from the rat dental epithelial SF2 line. When cultured with SF2 cells, SP cells differentiated into odontoblasts that expressed dentin sialophosphoprotein.

https://openalex.org/W1991161955,"The ability to track microbes in real time in vivo is of enormous value for preclinical investigations in infectious disease or gene therapy research. Bacteria present an attractive class of vector for cancer therapy, possessing a natural ability to grow preferentially within tumours following systemic administration. Bioluminescent Imaging (BLI) represents a powerful tool for use with bacteria engineered to express reporter genes such as lux. BLI is traditionally used as a 2D modality resulting in images that are limited in their ability to anatomically locate cell populations. Use of 3D diffuse optical tomography can localize the signals but still need to be combined with an anatomical imaging modality like micro-Computed Tomography (μCT) for interpretation. In this study, the non-pathogenic commensal bacteria E.coli K-12 MG1655 and Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003, or Salmonella Typhimurium SL7207 each expressing the luxABCDE operon were intravenously (IV) administered to mice bearing subcutaneous (s.c) FLuc-expressing xenograft tumours. Bacterial lux signal was detected specifically in tumours of mice post IV-administration and bioluminescence correlated with the numbers of bacteria recovered from tissue. Through whole body imaging for both lux and FLuc, bacteria and tumour cells were co-localised. 3D BLI and μCT image analysis revealed a pattern of multiple clusters of bacteria within tumours. Investigation of spatial resolution of 3D optical imaging was supported by ex vivo histological analyses. In vivo imaging of orally-administered commensal bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was also achieved using 3D BLI. This study demonstrates for the first time the potential to simultaneously image multiple BLI reporter genes three dimensionally in vivo using approaches that provide unique information on spatial locations."

Previous studies have revealed that Sulfs act predominantly on UA2S-GlcNS6S disaccharides and weakly on UA-GlcNS6S disaccharides. However, the specificity of Sulfs and their role in sulfation patterning of heparan sulfate in vivo remained unknown. Here, we performed disaccharide analysis of heparan sulfate in Sulf1 and Sulf2 knock-out mice. Significant increases in ΔUA2S-GlcNS6S were observed in the brain, small intestine, lung, spleen, testis, and skeletal muscle of adult Sulf1−/− mice and in the brain, liver, kidney, spleen, and testis of adult Sulf2−/− mice. In addition, increases in ΔUA-GlcNS6S were seen in the Sulf1−/− lung and small intestine.

https://openalex.org/W2113632923,"Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) undergo myofibroblastic activation in liver fibrosis and regeneration. This phenotypic switch is mechanistically similar to dedifferentiation of adipocytes as such the necdin-Wnt pathway causes epigenetic repression of the master adipogenic gene Pparγ, to activate HSCs. Now we report that delta-like 1 homolog (DLK1) is expressed selectively in HSCs in the adult rodent liver and induced in liver fibrosis and regeneration. Dlk1 knockdown in activated HSCs, causes suppression of necdin and Wnt, epigenetic derepression of Pparγ, and morphologic and functional reversal to quiescent cells. Hepatic Dlk1 expression is induced 40-fold at 24 h after partial hepatectomy (PH) in mice. HSCs and hepatocytes (HCs) isolated from the regenerating liver show Dlk1 induction in both cell types. In HC and HSC co-culture, increased proliferation and Dlk1 expression by HCs from PH are abrogated with anti-DLK1 antibody (Ab). Dlk1 and Wnt10b expression by Sham HCs are increased by co-culture with PH HSCs, and these effects are abolished with anti-DLK Ab. A tail vein injection of anti-DLK1 Ab at 6 h after PH reduces early HC proliferation and liver growth, accompanied by decreased Wnt10b, nonphosphorylated β-catenin, p-β-catenin (Ser-552), cyclins (cyclin D and cyclin A), cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4, and CDK1/2), p-ERK1/2, and p-AKT. In the mouse developing liver, HSC precursors and HSCs express high levels of Dlk1, concomitant with Dlk1 expression by hepatoblasts. These results suggest novel roles of HSC-derived DLK1 in activating HSCs via epigenetic Pparγ repression and participating in liver regeneration and development in a manner involving the mesenchymal-epithelial interaction."

Recently, microRNAs have been found to regulate DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and thus control methylation status in several genes. We first searched for microRNAs involved in DNMT-associated DNA methylation in the ERα gene. We also tested whether statin and a traditional Chinese medicine (San-Huang-Xie-Xin-Tang, SHXXT) could exert a therapeutic effect on microRNA, DNMT and ERα methylation. Methodology/Principal Findings The ERα expression was decreased and ERα methylation was increased in LPS-treated human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) and the aorta from rats under a high-fat diet. microRNA-152 was found to be down regulated in the LPS-treated HASMCs. We validated that microRNA-152 can knock down DNMT1 in HASMCs leading to hypermethylation of the ERα gene. Statin had no effect on microRNA-152, DNMT1 or ERα expression. On the contrary, SHXXT could restore microRNA-152, decrease DNMT1 and increase ERα expression in both cellular and animal studies. Conclusions/Significance The present study showed that microRNA-152 decreases under the pro-atherosclerotic conditions. The reduced microRNA-152 can lose an inhibitory effect on DNA methyltransferase, which leads to hypermethylation of the ERα gene and a decrease of ERα level. Although statin can not reverse these cascade proatherosclerotic changes, the SHXXT shows a promising effect to inhibit this unwanted signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2131545912,"Background Every year approximately 74,000 women die of endometrial cancer, mainly due to recurrent or metastatic disease. The presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) as well as progesterone receptor (PR) positivity has been correlated with improved prognosis. This study describes two mechanisms by which progesterone inhibits metastatic spread of endometrial cancer: by stimulating T-cell infiltration and by inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell transition (EMT). Methodology and Principal Findings Paraffin sections from patients with (n = 9) or without (n = 9) progressive endometrial cancer (recurrent or metastatic disease) were assessed for the presence of CD4+ (helper), CD8+ (cytotoxic) and Foxp3+ (regulatory) T-lymphocytes and PR expression. Progressive disease was observed to be associated with significant loss of TILs and loss of PR expression. Frozen tumor samples, used for genome-wide expression analysis, showed significant regulation of pathways involved in immunesurveillance, EMT and metastasis. For a number of genes, such as CXCL14, DKK1, DKK4, PEG10 and WIF1, quantitive RT-PCR was performed to verify up- or downregulation in progressive disease. To corroborate the role of progesterone in regulating invasion, Ishikawa(IK) endometrial cancer cell lines stably transfected with PRA (IKPRA), PRB(IKPRB) and PRA+PRB (IKPRAB) were cultured in presence/absence of progesterone (MPA) and used for genome-wide expression analysis, Boyden- and wound healing migration assays, and IHC for known EMT markers. IKPRB and IKPRAB cell lines showed MPA induced inhibition of migration and loss of the mesenchymal marker vimentin at the invasive front of the wound healing assay. Furthermore, pathway analysis of significantly MPA regulated genes showed significant down regulation of important pathways involved in EMT, immunesuppression and metastasis: such as IL6-, TGF-β and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Conclusion Intact progesterone signaling in non-progressive endometrial cancer seems to be an important factor stimulating immunosurveilance and inhibiting transition from an epithelial to a more mesenchymal, more invasive phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2065552179,"Ecotropic viral integration site-1 (EVI1) is one of the candidate oncogenes for human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with chromosomal alterations at 3q26. High EVI1 expression (EVI1(high)) is a risk factor for AML with poor outcome. Using DNA microarray analysis, we previously identified that integrin α6 (ITGA6) was upregulated over 10-fold in EVI1(high) leukemia cells. In this study, we determined whether the increased expression of ITGA6 is associated with drug-resistance and increased cell adhesion, resulting in poor prognosis. To this end, we first confirmed the expression pattern of a series of integrin genes using semi-quantitative PCR and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis and determined the cell adhesion ability in EVI1(high) leukemia cells. We found that the adhesion ability of EVI1(high) leukemia cells to laminin increased with the increased expression of ITGA6 and integrin β4 (ITGB4). The introduction of small-hairpin RNA against EVI1 (shEVI1) into EVI1(high) leukemia cells reduced the cell adhesion ability and downregulated the expression of ITGA6 and ITGB4. In addition, the overexpression of EVI1 in EVI1(low) leukemia cells enhanced their cell adhesion ability and increased the expression of ITGA6 and ITGB4. In a subsequent experiment, the introduction of shRNA against ITGA6 or ITGB4 into EVI1(high) AML cells downregulated their cell adhesion ability; however, the EVI1(high) AML cells transfected with shRNA against ITGA6 could not be maintained in culture. Moreover, treating EVI1(high) leukemia cells with neutralizing antibodies against ITGA6 or ITGB4 resulted in an enhanced responsiveness to anti-cancer drugs and a reduction of their cell adhesion ability. The expression of ITGA6 is significantly elevated in cells from relapsed and EVI1(high) AML cases; therefore, ITGA6 might represent an important therapeutic target for both refractory and EVI1(high) AML."

https://openalex.org/W2055389629,"Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are essential components of the extracellular matrix, the natural environment from which cell behavior is regulated by a number or tissue homeostasis guarantors including growth factors. Because most heparin-binding growth factor activities are regulated by GAGs, structural and functional alterations of these polysaccharides may consequently affect the integrity of tissues during critical physiological and pathological processes. Here, we investigated whether the aging process can induce changes in the myocardial GAG composition in rats and whether these changes can affect the activities of particular heparin-binding growth factors known to sustain cardiac tissue integrity. Our results showed an age-dependent increase of GAG levels in the left ventricle. Biochemical and immunohistological studies pointed out heparan sulfates (HS) as the GAG species that increased with age. ELISA-based competition assays showed altered capacities of the aged myocardial GAGs to bind FGF-1, FGF-2, and VEGF but not HB EGF. Mitogenic assays in cultured cells showed an age-dependent decrease of the elderly GAG capacities to potentiate FGF-2 whereas the potentiating effect on VEGF(165) was increased, as confirmed by augmented angiogenic cell proliferation in Matrigel plugs. Moreover, HS disaccharide analysis showed considerably altered 6-O-sulfation with modest changes in N- and 2-O-sulfations. Together, these findings suggest a physiological significance of HS structural and functional alterations during aging. This can be associated with an age-dependent decline of the extracellular matrix capacity to efficiently modulate not only the activity of resident or therapeutic growth factors but also the homing of resident or therapeutic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2065199750,"Prior studies of appetite regulatory networks, primarily in rodents, have established that targeted electrical stimulation of ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) can alter food intake patterns and metabolic homeostasis. Consideration of this method for weight modulation in humans with severe overeating disorders and morbid obesity can be further advanced by modeling procedures and assessing endpoints that can provide preclinical data on efficacy and safety. In this study we adapted human deep brain stimulation (DBS) stereotactic methods and instrumentation to demonstrate in a large animal model the modulation of weight gain with VMH-DBS. Female Göttingen minipigs were used because of their dietary habits, physiologic characteristics, and brain structures that resemble those of primates. Further, these animals become obese on extra-feeding regimens. DBS electrodes were first bilaterally implanted into the VMH of the animals (n = 8) which were then maintained on a restricted food regimen for 1 mo following the surgery. The daily amount of food was then doubled for the next 2 mo in all animals to produce obesity associated with extra calorie intake, with half of the animals (n = 4) concurrently receiving continuous low frequency (50 Hz) VMH-DBS. Adverse motoric or behavioral effects were not observed subsequent to the surgical procedure or during the DBS period. Throughout this 2 mo DBS period, all animals consumed the doubled amount of daily food. However, the animals that had received VMH-DBS showed a cumulative weight gain (6.1±0.4 kg; mean ± SEM) that was lower than the nonstimulated VMH-DBS animals (9.4±1.3 kg; p<0.05), suggestive of a DBS-associated increase in metabolic rate. These results in a porcine obesity model demonstrate the efficacy and behavioral safety of a low frequency VMH-DBS application as a potential clinical strategy for modulation of body weight."
https://openalex.org/W2007071405,"Background Lycopene is the main carotenoid in tomatoes, where it is found in high concentrations. Strong epidemiological evidence suggests that lycopene may provide protection against cardiovascular diseases. We therefore studied the effects of lycopene on diet-induced increase in serum lipid levels and the initiation of atherosclerosis in New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits. Methodology/Principal Findings The animals, divided into four groups of 9 animals each, were fed either a standard diet, a high-cholesterol diet containing 0.5% cholesterol, a high-cholesterol diet containing placebo beadlets, or a high-cholesterol diet plus 5 mg/kg body weight/day of lycopene (in the form of lycopene beadlets), for a period of 4 weeks. We found significantly elevated lycopene plasma levels in the animal group treated with lycopene beadlets. Compared to the high-cholesterol and the placebo group, this was associated with a significant reduction of 50% in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol serum levels in the lycopene group. The amount of cholesteryl ester in the aorta was significantly decreased by lycopene. However, we did not observe a significant decrease in the extent of aortic surface lipid accumulation in the lycopene group. In addition, no differences in the intima-media thickness among groups were observed. Endothelial-dependent and endothelial-independent vasodilation in isolated rabbit aortic and carotid rings did not differ among any of the animal groups. Conclusions Lycopene supplementation for 4 weeks increased lycopene plasma levels in the animals. Although we found strongly reduced total and LDL cholesterol serum levels as well as significantly lower amounts of cholesteryl ester in the aortae in the lycopene-treated group, no significant differences in initial lesions in the aortae were detected."
https://openalex.org/W2011764233,"Although Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) is a rare and an aggressive type of locally advanced breast cancer with a generally worst prognosis, little work has been done in identifying the status of non-genomic signaling in the invasiveness of IBC. The present study was performed to explore the status of non-genomic signaling as affected by various estrogenic and anti-estrogenic agents in IBC cell lines SUM149 and SUM190. We have identified the presence of estrogen receptor α (ERα) variant, ERα36 in SUM149 and SUM190 cells. This variant as well as ERβ was present in a substantial concentration in IBC cells. The treatment with estradiol (E2), anti-estrogenic agents 4-hydroxytamoxifen and ICI 182780, ERβ specific ligand DPN and GPR30 agonist G1 led to a rapid activation of p-ERK1/2, suggesting the involvement of ERα36, ERβ and GPR30 in the non-genomic signaling pathway in these cells. We also found a substantial increase in the cell migration and invasiveness of SUM149 cells upon the treatment with these ligands. Both basal and ligand-induced migration and invasiveness of SUM149 cells were drastically reduced in the presence of MEK inhibitor U0126, implicating that the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by MEK is involved in the observed motility and invasiveness of IBC cells. We also provide evidence for the upregulation of p-ERK1/2 through immunostaining in IBC patient samples. These findings suggest a role of non-genomic signaling through the activation of p-ERK1/2 in the hormonal dependence of IBC by a combination of estrogen receptors. These findings only explain the failure of traditional anti-estrogen therapies in ER-positive IBC which induces the non-genomic signaling, but also opens newer avenues for design of modified therapies targeting these estrogen receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1966921870,"PfEMP1 proteins comprise a family of variant antigens that appear on the surface of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes and bind to multiple host receptors. Using a mammalian expression system and BioPlex technology, we developed an array of 24 protein constructs representing 38 PfEMP1 domains for high throughput analyses of receptor binding as well as total and functional antibody responses. We analyzed the reactivity of 561 plasma samples from 378 young Tanzanian children followed up to maximum 192 weeks of life in a longitudinal birth cohort. Surprisingly, reactivity to the DBL5 domain of VAR2CSA, a pregnancy malaria vaccine candidate, was most common, and the prevalence of reactivity was stable throughout early childhood. Reactivity to all other PfEMP1 constructs increased with age. Antibodies to the DBL2βC2(PF11_0521) domain, measured as plasma reactivity or plasma inhibition of ICAM1 binding, predicted reduced risk of hospitalization for severe or moderately severe malaria. These data suggest a role for VAR2CSA in childhood malaria and implicate DBL2βC2(PF11_0521) in protective immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2004106061,"Obesity is a major health problem worldwide. We are studying the causes and effects of obesity in C57Bl/6 mice following genetic ablation of NG2, a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan widely expressed in progenitor cells and also in adipocytes. Although global NG2 ablation delays early postnatal adipogenesis in mouse skin, adult NG2 null mice are paradoxically heavier than wild-type mice, exhibiting larger white fat deposits. This adult onset obesity is not due to NG2-dependent effects on CNS function, since specific ablation of NG2 in oligodendrocyte progenitors yields the opposite phenotype; i.e. abnormally lean mice. Metabolic analysis reveals that, while activity and food intake are unchanged in global NG2 null mice, O2 consumption and CO2 production are decreased, suggesting a decrease in energy expenditure. Since brown fat plays important roles in regulating energy expenditure, we have investigated brown fat function via cold challenge and high fat diet feeding, both of which induce the adaptive thermogenesis that normally occurs in brown fat. In both tests, body temperatures in NG2 null mice are reduced compared to wild-type mice, indicating a deficit in brown fat function in the absence of NG2. In addition, adipogenesis in NG2 null brown pre-adipocytes is dramatically impaired compared to wild-type counterparts. Moreover, mRNA levels for PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator (PGC)1-α, proteins important for brown adipocyte differentiation, are decreased in NG2 null brown fat deposits in vivo and NG2 null brown pre-adipocytes in vitro. Altogether, these results indicate that brown fat dysfunction in NG2 null mice results from deficits in the recruitment and/or development of brown pre-adipocytes. As a consequence, obesity in NG2 null mice may occur due to disruptions in brown fat-dependent energy homeostasis, with resulting effects on lipid storage in white adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2080786417,"Background Maternal infection during pregnancy may be a risk factor for epilepsy in offspring. Use of antibiotics is a valid marker of infection. Methodology/Principal Findings To examine the relationship between maternal infection during pregnancy and risk of childhood epilepsy we conducted a historical cohort study of singletons born in northern Denmark from 1998 through 2008 who survived ≥29 days. We used population-based medical databases to ascertain maternal use of antibiotics or hospital contacts with infection during pregnancy, as well as first-time hospital contacts with a diagnosis of epilepsy among offspring. We compared incidence rates (IR) of epilepsy among children of mothers with and without infection during pregnancy. We examined the outcome according to trimester of exposure, type of antibiotic, and total number of prescriptions, using Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) while adjusting for covariates. Among 191 383 children in the cohort, 948 (0.5%) were hospitalised or had an outpatient visit for epilepsy during follow-up, yielding an IR of 91 per 100 000 person-years (PY). The five-year cumulative incidence of epilepsy was 4.5 per 1000 children. Among children exposed prenatally to maternal infection, the IR was 117 per 100 000 PY, with an adjusted IRR of 1.40 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22–1.61), compared with unexposed children. The association was unaffected by trimester of exposure, antibiotic type, or prescription count. Conclusions/Significance Prenatal exposure to maternal infection is associated with an increased risk of epilepsy in childhood. The similarity of estimates across types of antibiotics suggests that processes common to all infections underlie this outcome, rather than specific pathogens or drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1986598998,"The dentate gyrus is the primary afferent into the hippocampal formation, with important functions in learning and memory. Granule cells, the principle neuronal type in the dentate gyrus, are mostly formed postnatally, in a process that continues into adulthood. External stimuli, including environmental enrichment, voluntary exercise and learning, have been shown to significantly accelerate the generation and maturation of dentate granule cells in adult rodents. Whether, and to what extent, such environmental stimuli regulate the development and maturation of dentate granule cells during early postnatal development is largely unknown. Furthermore, whether natural stimuli affect the synaptic properties of granule cells had been investigated neither in newborn neurons of the adult nor during early development. To examine the effect of natural sensory stimulation on the dentate gyrus, we reared newborn mice in an enriched environment (EE). Using immunohistochemistry, we showed that dentate granule cells from EE-reared mice exhibited earlier morphological maturation, manifested as faster peaking of doublecortin expression and elevated expression of mature neuronal markers (including NeuN, calbindin and MAP2) at the end of the second postnatal week. Also at the end of the second postnatal week, we found increased density of dendritic spines across the entire dentate gyrus, together with elevated levels of postsynaptic scaffold (post-synaptic density 95) and receptor proteins (GluR2 and GABAARγ2) of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Furthermore, dentate granule cells of P14 EE-reared mice had lower input resistances and increased glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic inputs. Together, our results demonstrate that EE-rearing promotes morphological and electrophysiological maturation of dentate granule cells, underscoring the importance of natural environmental stimulation on development of the dentate gyrus."
https://openalex.org/W2008828079,"In basketball, every time the offense produces a shot opportunity the player with the ball must decide whether the shot is worth taking. In this article, I explore the question of when a team should shoot and when they should pass up the shot by considering a simple theoretical model of the shot selection process, in which the quality of shot opportunities generated by the offense is assumed to fall randomly within a uniform distribution. Within this model I derive an answer to the question “how likely must the shot be to go in before the player should take it?” and I show that this lower cutoff for shot quality depends crucially on the number of shot opportunities remaining (say, before the shot clock expires), with larger demanding that only higher-quality shots should be taken. The function is also derived in the presence of a finite turnover rate and used to predict the shooting rate of an optimal-shooting team as a function of time. The theoretical prediction for the optimal shooting rate is compared to data from the National Basketball Association (NBA). The comparison highlights some limitations of the theoretical model, while also suggesting that NBA teams may be overly reluctant to shoot the ball early in the shot clock."
https://openalex.org/W2107169447,"Observers continually make unconscious inferences about the state of the world based on ambiguous sensory information. This process of perceptual decision-making may be optimized by learning from experience. We investigated the influence of previous perceptual experience on the interpretation of ambiguous visual information. Observers were pre-exposed to a perceptually stabilized sequence of an ambiguous structure-from-motion stimulus by means of intermittent presentation. At the subsequent re-appearance of the same ambiguous stimulus perception was initially biased toward the previously stabilized perceptual interpretation. However, prolonged viewing revealed a bias toward the alternative perceptual interpretation. The prevalence of the alternative percept during ongoing viewing was largely due to increased durations of this percept, as there was no reliable decrease in the durations of the pre-exposed percept. Moreover, the duration of the alternative percept was modulated by the specific characteristics of the pre-exposure, whereas the durations of the pre-exposed percept were not. The increase in duration of the alternative percept was larger when the pre-exposure had lasted longer and was larger after ambiguous pre-exposure than after unambiguous pre-exposure. Using a binocular rivalry stimulus we found analogous perceptual biases, while pre-exposure did not affect eye-bias. We conclude that previously perceived interpretations dominate at the onset of ambiguous sensory information, whereas alternative interpretations dominate prolonged viewing. Thus, at first instance ambiguous information seems to be judged using familiar percepts, while re-evaluation later on allows for alternative interpretations."
https://openalex.org/W2036834971,"Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a natural and widespread genotoxin. Given its potentially deleterious effects, it is of interest to establish the identities of the cell types containing this aldehyde. We used in situ chemical trapping with 2-thiobarbituric acid and mass spectrometry with a deuterated standard to characterize MDA pools in the vegetative phase in Arabidopsis thaliana. In leaves, MDA occurred predominantly in the intracellular compartment of mesophyll cells and was enriched in chloroplasts where it was derived primarily from triunsaturated fatty acids (TFAs). High levels of MDA (most of which was unbound) were found within dividing cells in the root tip cell proliferation zone. The bulk of this MDA did not originate from TFAs. We confirmed the localization of MDA in transversal root sections. In addition to MDA in proliferating cells near the root tip we found evidence for the presence of MDA in pericyle cells. Remodeling of non-TFA-derived MDA pools occurred when seedlings were infected with the fungus Botrytis cinerea. Treatment of uninfected seedlings with mediators of plant stress responses (jasmonic acid or salicylic acid) increased seedling MDA levels over 20-fold. In summary, major pools of MDA are associated with cell division foci containing stem cells. The aldehyde is pathogen-inducible in these regions and its levels are increased by cellular mediators that impact defense and growth."
https://openalex.org/W2000424101,"Background Calcimimetics, such as R-568, are thought to activate G protein-linked Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR) by allosterically increasing the affinity of the receptor for Ca2+ allowing for efficient control of uremic hyperparathyroidism. Several recent studies suggest they possess additional vascular actions. Although it has been postulated that calcimimetics may have a direct effect on CaSR in the blood vessels, further studies are needed to elucidate their vascular CaSR-dependent versus CaSR-independent effects. Methodology/Principal Findings Focusing on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we studied the CaSR expression and distribution by Immunofluorescence and Western Blot analysis. CaSR function was evaluated by measuring the potential effect of calcimimetic R-568 and its enantiomer S-568 upon the modulation of intracellular Ca2+ levels (using a single cell approach and FURA-2AM), in the presence or absence of Calhex-231, a negative modulator of CaSR. To address their potential vascular functions, we also evaluated R- and S-568-stimulated enzymatic release of Nitric Oxide (NO) by DAF-2DA, by Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) radiometric assay (both in HUVECs and in Human Aortic Endothelial Cells) and by measuring eNOS-ser1177 phosphorylation levels (Immunoblotting). We show that, although the CaSR protein was expressed in HUVECs, it was mainly distributed in cytoplasm while the functional CaSR dimers, usually localized on the plasma membrane, were absent. In addition, regardless of the presence or absence of Calhex-231, both R- and S-568 significantly increased intracellular Ca2+ levels by mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, which in turn augmented NO release by a time- and Ca2+-dependent increase in eNOS-ser1177 phosphorylation levels. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these data indicate that in human endothelium there is no stereoselectivity in the responses to calcimimetics and that CaSR is probably not involved in the action of R- and S-568. This suggests an additional mechanism in support of the CaSR-independent role of calcimimetics as vasculotrope agents."
https://openalex.org/W2025354840,"Selenium and sulfur are two closely related basic elements utilized in nature for a vast array of biochemical reactions. While toxic at higher concentrations, selenium is an essential trace element incorporated into selenoproteins as selenocysteine (Sec), the selenium analogue of cysteine (Cys). Sec lyases (SCLs) and Cys desulfurases (CDs) catalyze the removal of selenium or sulfur from Sec or Cys and generally act on both substrates. In contrast, human SCL (hSCL) is specific for Sec although the only difference between Sec and Cys is the identity of a single atom. The chemical basis of this selenium-over-sulfur discrimination is not understood. Here we describe the X-ray crystal structure of hSCL and identify Asp146 as the key residue that provides the Sec specificity. A D146K variant resulted in loss of Sec specificity and appearance of CD activity. A dynamic active site segment also provides the structural prerequisites for direct product delivery of selenide produced by Sec cleavage, thus avoiding release of reactive selenide species into the cell. We thus here define a molecular determinant for enzymatic specificity discrimination between a single selenium versus sulfur atom, elements with very similar chemical properties. Our findings thus provide molecular insights into a key level of control in human selenium and selenoprotein turnover and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2025749347,"Figs are the inflorescences of fig trees (Ficus spp., Moraceae). They are shaped like a hollow ball, lined on their inner surface by numerous tiny female flowers. Pollination is carried out by host-specific fig wasps (Agaonidae). Female pollinators enter the figs through a narrow entrance gate and once inside can walk around on a platform generated by the stigmas of the flowers. They lay their eggs into the ovules, via the stigmas and styles, and also gall the flowers, causing the ovules to expand and their pedicels to elongate. A single pollinator larva develops in each galled ovule. Numerous species of non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFW, belonging to other families of Chalcidoidea) also make use of galled ovules in the figs. Some initiate galls, others make use of pollinator-generated galls, killing pollinator larvae. Most NPFW oviposit from the outside of figs, making peripherally-located pollinator larvae more prone to attack. Style length variation is high among monoecious Ficus spp. and pollinators mainly oviposit into more centrally-located ovules, with shorter styles. Style length variation is lower in male (wasp-producing) figs of dioecious Ficus spp., making ovules equally vulnerable to attack by NPFW at the time that pollinators oviposit. We recorded the spatial distributions of galled ovules in mature male figs of the dioecious Ficus hirta in Southern China. The galls contained pollinators and three NPFW that kill them. Pollinators were concentrated in galls located towards the centre of the figs, NPFW towards the periphery. Due to greater pedicel elongation by male galls, male pollinators became located in more central galls than their females, and so were less likely to be attacked. This helps ensure that sufficient males survive, despite strongly female-biased sex ratios, and may be a consequence of the pollinator females laying mostly male eggs at the start of oviposition sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2005268748,"CD36 is a ubiquitous membrane glycoprotein that binds long-chain fatty acids. The presence of a functional CD36 is required for the induction of satiety by a lipid load and its role as a lipid receptor driving cellular signal has recently been demonstrated. Our project aimed to further explore the role of intestinal CD36 in the regulation of food intake. Duodenal infusions of vehicle or sulfo-N-succinimidyl-oleate (SSO) was performed prior to acute infusions of saline or Intralipid (IL) in mice. Infusion of minute quantities of IL induced a decrease in food intake (FI) compared to saline. Infusion of SSO had the same effect but no additive inhibitory effect was observed in presence of IL. No IL- or SSO-mediated satiety occurred in CD36-null mice. To determine whether the CD36-mediated hypophagic effect of lipids was maintained in animals fed a satietogen diet, mice were subjected to a High-Protein diet (HPD). Concomitantly with the satiety effect, a rise in intestinal CD36 gene expression was observed. No satiety effect occurred in CD36-null mice. HPD-fed WT mice showed a diminished FI compared to control mice, after saline duodenal infusion. But there was no further decrease after lipid infusion. The lipid-induced decrease in FI observed on control mice was accompanied by a rise in jejunal oleylethanolamide (OEA). Its level was higher in HPD-fed mice than in controls after saline infusion and was not changed by lipids. Overall, we demonstrate that lipid binding to intestinal CD36 is sufficient to produce a satiety effect. Moreover, it could participate in the satiety effect induced by HPD. Intestine can modulate FI by several mechanisms including an increase in OEA production and CD36 gene expression. Furthermore, intestine of mice adapted to HPD have a diminished capacity to modulate their food intake in response to dietary lipids."
https://openalex.org/W2057499470,"Environmental changes affecting the relationship between the developing immune system and microbial exposure have been implicated in the epidemic rise of allergic disease in developed countries. While early developmental differences in T cell function are well-recognised, there is now emerging evidence that this is related to developmental differences in innate immune function. In this study we sought to examine if differences associated with innate immunity contribute to the altered immune programming recognised in allergic children. Here, we describe for the first time, the association of carriage of the T allele of the tagging single nucleotide polymorphism rs12979860 3 kb upstream of IL28B, encoding the potent innate immune modulator type III interferon lambda (IFN-λ3), and allergy in children (p = 0.004; OR 4.56). Strikingly, the association between rs12979860 genotype and allergic disease is enhanced in girls. Furthermore, carriage of the T allele at rs12979860 correlates with differences in the pro-inflammatory profile during the first five years of life suggesting this contributes to the key differences in subsequent innate immune development in children who develop allergic disease. In the context of rising rates of disease, these immunologic differences already present at birth imply very early interaction between genetic predisposition and prenatal environmental influences."
https://openalex.org/W2012858316,"Background Hypoxia and hypoxia-reoxygenation (H-R) are pathogenic factors in many liver diseases that lead to hepatocyte death as a result of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. The tumor necrosis factor super-family member CD154 can also induce hepatocyte apoptosis via activation of its receptor CD40 and induction of autocrine/paracrine Fas Ligand/CD178 but the relationship between CD40 activation, ROS generation and apoptosis is poorly understood. We hypothesised that CD40 activation and ROS accumulation act synergistically to drive human hepatocyte apoptosis. Methods Human hepatocytes were isolated from liver tissue and exposed to an in vitro model of hypoxia and H-R in the presence or absence of CD154 and/or various inhibitors. Hepatocyte ROS production, apoptosis and necrosis were determined by labelling cells with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin, Annexin-V and 7-AAD respectively in a three-colour reporter flow cytometry assay. Results Exposure of human hepatocytes to recombinant CD154 or platelet-derived soluble CD154 augments ROS accumulation during H-R resulting in NADPH oxidase-dependent apoptosis and necrosis. The inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal Kinase and p38 attenuated CD154-mediated apoptosis but not necrosis. Conclusions CD154-mediated apoptosis of hepatocytes involves ROS generation that is amplified during hypoxia-reoxygenation. This finding provides a molecular mechanism to explain the role of platelets in hepatocyte death during ischemia-reperfusion injury."
https://openalex.org/W2055684086,"Human α-hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) is a conserved mammalian erythroid protein that facilitates the production of Hemoglobin A by stabilizing free α-globin. AHSP rapidly binds to ferrous α with association (k′AHSP) and dissociation (kAHSP) rate constants of ≈10 μm−1 s−1 and 0.2 s−1, respectively, at pH 7.4 at 22 °C. A small slow phase was observed when AHSP binds to excess ferrous αCO. This slow phase appears to be due to cis to trans prolyl isomerization of the Asp29-Pro30 peptide bond in wild-type AHSP because it was absent when αCO was mixed with P30A and P30W AHSP, which are fixed in the trans conformation. This slow phase was also absent when met(Fe3+)-α reacted with wild-type AHSP, suggesting that met-α is capable of rapidly binding to either Pro30 conformer. Both wild-type and Pro30-substituted AHSPs drive the formation of a met-α hemichrome conformation following binding to either met- or oxy(Fe2+)-α. The dissociation rate of the met-α·AHSP complex (kAHSP ≈ 0.002 s−1) is ∼100-fold slower than that for ferrous α·AHSP complexes, resulting in a much higher affinity of AHSP for met-α. Thus, in vivo, AHSP acts as a molecular chaperone by rapidly binding and stabilizing met-α hemichrome folding intermediates. The low rate of met-α dissociation also allows AHSP to have a quality control function by kinetically trapping ferric α and preventing its incorporation into less stable mixed valence Hemoglobin A tetramers. Reduction of AHSP-bound met-α allows more rapid release to β subunits to form stable fully, reduced hemoglobin dimers and tetramers. Human α-hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) is a conserved mammalian erythroid protein that facilitates the production of Hemoglobin A by stabilizing free α-globin. AHSP rapidly binds to ferrous α with association (k′AHSP) and dissociation (kAHSP) rate constants of ≈10 μm−1 s−1 and 0.2 s−1, respectively, at pH 7.4 at 22 °C. A small slow phase was observed when AHSP binds to excess ferrous αCO. This slow phase appears to be due to cis to trans prolyl isomerization of the Asp29-Pro30 peptide bond in wild-type AHSP because it was absent when αCO was mixed with P30A and P30W AHSP, which are fixed in the trans conformation. This slow phase was also absent when met(Fe3+)-α reacted with wild-type AHSP, suggesting that met-α is capable of rapidly binding to either Pro30 conformer. Both wild-type and Pro30-substituted AHSPs drive the formation of a met-α hemichrome conformation following binding to either met- or oxy(Fe2+)-α. The dissociation rate of the met-α·AHSP complex (kAHSP ≈ 0.002 s−1) is ∼100-fold slower than that for ferrous α·AHSP complexes, resulting in a much higher affinity of AHSP for met-α. Thus, in vivo, AHSP acts as a molecular chaperone by rapidly binding and stabilizing met-α hemichrome folding intermediates. The low rate of met-α dissociation also allows AHSP to have a quality control function by kinetically trapping ferric α and preventing its incorporation into less stable mixed valence Hemoglobin A tetramers. Reduction of AHSP-bound met-α allows more rapid release to β subunits to form stable fully, reduced hemoglobin dimers and tetramers.

However, questions remain regarding its role in α prosthetic group acquisition, oxidation state maintenance, subunit folding, and stabilization prior to incorporation into HbA. In this work, we used optical absorbance and fluorescence emission spectroscopy in stopped-flow rapid mixing experiments to measure the rates of α binding to and release from AHSP. In agreement with work done by Gell et al. (16Gell D.A. Feng L. Zhou S. Jeffrey P.D. Bendak K. Gow A. Weiss M.J. Shi Y. Mackay J.P. A cis-proline in α-hemoglobin stabilizing protein directs the structural reorganization of α-hemoglobin.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 29462-29469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we report that the affinity of AHSP is dependent on α oxidation state and for the first time show that the rate of met-α dissociation from AHSP is dramatically slower than that for reduced α dissociation. Experiments with clinically significant and rationally selected AHSP and α mutants revealed the functional importance of the loop separating α-helices 1 and 2 of AHSP. Collectively, this work suggests that AHSP stabilizes α in vivo by preferentially binding an oxidized α hemichrome folding intermediate and temporarily impairing α assembly into HbA until reduction to the ferrous state has occurred. AHSP protein was obtained from pGEX-2T (GE Healthcare) with the full-length human AHSP gene inserted downstream of the Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase gene (pGEX-2T-AHSP) (GenBankTM accession number NM_016633.2) (11Kihm A.J.

AHSP mutants were generated using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) in accordance with manufacturer's instructions and the following PCR primers: AHSPP30A, 5′-CTG AAT CAG CAG GTC TTC AAT GAT GCG CTC GTC TCT GAA GAA GAC-3′ and 5′-GTC TTC TTC AGA GAC GAG CGC ATC ATT GAA GAC CTG CTG ATT CAG-3′; AHSPP30W, 5′-ATC AGC AGG TCT TCA ATG ATT GGC TCG TCT CTG AAG AAG ACA TG-3′ and 5′-CAT GTC TTC TTC AGA GAC GAG CCA ATC ATT GAA GAC CTG CTG AT-3′; AHSPQ25K, 5′-CAG CGT TCT GCT GAA TCA GAA GGT CTT CAA TGA TCC TCT C-3′ and 5′-GAG AGG ATC ATT GAA GAC CTT CTG ATT CAG CAG AAC GC TG-3′; AHSPD29R, 5′-AAT CAG CAG GTC TTC AAT CGT CCT CTC GTC TCT GAA GAA G-3′ and 5′-CTT CTT CAG AGA CGA GAG GAC GAT TGA AGA CCT GCT GAT T-3′. Primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, Iowa). AHSP was expressed as a GST fusion protein using Escherichia coli BL21 cells (EMD Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA; Novagen brand) using methods developed previously (11Kihm A.J. Kong Y. Hong W. Russell J.E. Rouda S. Adachi K. Simon M.C. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J.

The soluble GST-AHSP present in the supernatant was captured using ∼25 ml of glutathione-Sepharose FF medium and an ÄKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare). During this process, PBS was used as a binding and wash buffer, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm reduced glutathione, pH 8.0 at 25 °C was used as an elution buffer. GST was cleaved from AHSP using 500 units of thrombin obtained from GE Healthcare. Reduced glutathione, free GST, thrombin, uncleaved AHSP, and other contaminants were then removed by size exclusion chromatography using a preparative grade Superdex 75 HiLOAD prepacked column (GE Healthcare). Yields of GST-free AHSP were ∼10 mg/liter of bacterial culture. The AHSP produced using this method contains an extra N-terminal Gly-Ser dipeptide appendage due to the thrombin cleavage site (12Gell D. Kong Y. Eaton S.A. Weiss M.J. Mackay J.P.

Sun D.P. Cottam P.F. Simplaceanu V. Tam M.F. Bell Jr., D.A. Ho C. Production of human normal adult and fetal hemoglobins in Escherichia coli.Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and a mutated version of the pHE2 plasmid provided by C. Ho and T-J. Shen (Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA). HbA bearing αK99E was produced by site-directed mutagenesis and the following mutagenic primers: 5′-CCG GTT AAC TTC GAA CTG CTG TCT CAC TGC C-3′ and 5′-GGC AGT GAG ACA GCA GTT CGA AGT TAA CCG G-3′. Recombinant Hb Turriff was expressed and purified using the methods described by Birukou et al. (23Birukou I. Schweers R.L. Olson J.S.

Chem. 2010; 285: 8840-8854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). HbA was purified from units of human blood obtained from the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center (Houston, TX) using established methods (24Wiedermann B.L. Olson J.S. Acceleration of tetramer formation by the binding of inositol hexaphosphate to hemoglobin dimers.J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5273-5275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Separated α and β chains were isolated using established methods (25Geraci G. Parkhurst L.J. Gibson Q.H. Preparation and properties of α- and β-chains from human hemoglobin.J. Biol.

Chem. 1965; 240: PC551-PC552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that were modified as follows. Incubation of CO-liganded HbA with 4-(hydroxymercuri)benzoic acid was limited to ∼4 h at 4 °C instead of overnight. Following this incubation, samples were rapidly buffer-exchanged into 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 at 4 °C using a column containing 200 ml of Sephadex G-25 medium (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were then applied to another column containing 100 ml of diethylaminoethyl cellulose medium that had been equilibrated with the same buffer (DE52 medium, Whatman). This column retains β and tetrameric HbA while allowing α to flow through. HbA was then eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 at 4 °C, and β was eluted using 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 at 4 °C. Rather than regenerating sulfhydryl groups using the methods of Geraci et al. (25Geraci G. Parkhurst L.J. Gibson Q.H. Preparation and properties of α- and β-chains from human hemoglobin.J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4664-4667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a final concentration of 5 ml/liter β-mercaptoethanol was added to each sample on ice after which the samples were immediately exchanged into 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 at 4 °C using a column containing 200 ml of Sephadex G-25 medium. This entire process was done in less than 8 h, and all work was done in a room maintained at 4 °C. Regeneration of sulfhydryl groups was assayed by Boyer titration (27Boyer P.D. Spectrophotometric study of protein sulfhydryl groups with organic mercurials.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 4331-4337Crossref Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Chain isolations were done in 4-ml batches of 50 mg/ml HbA. Plasmid DNA was isolated from each AHSP expression and sent for sequencing to Lone Star Laboratories, Inc. (Houston, TX) using manufacturer-specified sequencing primers to verify the absence of any unwanted mutations. These primers were 5′-GGG CTG GCA AGC CAC GTT TGG TG-3′ and 5′-CCG GGA GCT GCA TGT GTC AGA GG-3′. SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie Blue were used to confirm protein expression; GST cleavage; and GST, thrombin, and contaminant removal. MALDI-TOF spectrometry performed at Rice University (Houston, TX) confirmed the identity and purity of AHSP. HbA, α, and β purities and reassembly efficiency were verified by cellulose acetate electrophoresis (Helena Laboratories Corp., Beaumont, TX). Absorbance spectra and ligand binding kinetics were also verified to ensure that the samples retained normal function following purification and isolation (28Mollan T.L. The Role of Alpha-Hemoglobin Stabilizing Protein in Hemoglobin Subunit Assembly. Rice University, 2011Google Scholar). Heme protein concentrations were determined using extinction coefficients reported previously (29Banerjee R. Alpert Y. Leterrier F. Williams R.J.

Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. Elsevier, Amsterdam1971: 13-54Google Scholar). With the exception of AHSPP30W, AHSP concentrations were determined by optical absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient 11,460 m−1 cm−1, which was calculated using the ExPASy Proteomics Server ProtParam Tool. The extinction coefficient used for AHSPP30W was 16,960 m−1 cm−1, which was calculated in the same manner. Manual mixing spectrophotometry was done in either a Cary 50Bio (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) or a UV2401PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Inc., Columbia, MD) using cuvettes purchased from Starna Cells (Atascadero, CA). Stopped-flow spectrophotometry was done using either a modified Durrum Model D-110 (Palo Alto, CA) or an Applied Photophysics PiStar kinetic circular dichroism stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Leatherhead, Surrey, UK). Unless otherwise indicated, all stopped-flow fluorescence experiments were performed using exit and entrance slit widths of 5 nm for the excitation monochromator, an excitation wavelength of 280 nm, and a cutoff filter fitted to the sample housing that allowed the measurement of total sample fluorescence emission above a wavelength of 302 nm. The volume of the cell was 20 μl, and the excitation pathlength of the incident light was 10 mm. The photomultiplier unit was positioned at a 90° angle from the incident light, and the fluorescence cell width was 1 mm (total cell dimensions were 10 × 2 × 1 mm). Shot volumes were between 100 and 200 μl, and mixing was performed using equal volumes of reactant solutions. Unless otherwise noted, all experiments were performed using 50–150 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 at 22 °C, and all concentrations are given as postmixing. Glass syringes were used whenever possible in the stopped-flow experiments to prevent atmospheric gas contamination (Cadence Science, Lincoln, RI). All buffers, salts, and medium components used for these experiments were obtained from either Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher Scientific. CO and O2 gases were obtained from Matheson Tri-gas, Inc. (Basking Ridge, NJ). Microsoft Excel was used for nonlinear least square data fitting (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) (31Kemmer G. Keller S. Nonlinear least-squares data fitting in Excel spreadsheets.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 267-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Theoretical data sets calculated from the expressions defined in the text were put into an Excel spreadsheet along with experimentally obtained data, and the sum of the squared residuals were minimized using the Excel Solver tool to obtain visual assessments of plots of the observed and theoretical time courses. Fitting routines in Origin were also used to verify the values obtained from Excel (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). Structure images were created using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY). Recombinant human wild-type AHSP (AHSPWT) exhibits intrinsic fluorescence from several aromatic side chains (32Baudin-Creuza V. Vasseur-Godbillon C. Pato C. Préhu C. Wajcman H. Marden M.C.

Although wild-type human α and β also contain these residues, neither of these subunits exhibit strong intrinsic fluorescence due to highly efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer to their heme prosthetic groups (33Alpert B.

When α binds to AHSP, this energy transfer quenches the intrinsic fluorescence of AHSP. The key residue in this process is thought to be AHSP Trp44 (32Baudin-Creuza V. Vasseur-Godbillon C. Pato C.

As shown in Fig. 1A, mixing αWT with AHSPWT resulted in rapid fluorescence quenching on time scales of less than 100 s. The observed time courses for wild-type AHSP are biphasic with a fast phase showing a rate that is linearly dependent on [αWT] and a smaller (20–30%) slow phase showing an observed rate that is concentration-independent and equal to 0.04 ± 0.01 s−1 in 100 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 at 22 °C. This slow phase was not present when the concentration of αWT was substantially less than that of AHSPWT. The titration in Fig. 1A indicates that the fast phase of the binding reaction corresponds to a bimolecular association event, which is consistent with previous studies of the formation of reduced α·AHSP complexes (11Kihm A.J.

The association rate constant, k′AHSP, was obtained by plotting the observed rates (kobs) for the fast phase against [α] under pseudo-first-order conditions when αWT was in molar excess (Fig. 1B). In this plot, the slope of the line is equal to k′AHSP. Fitting data from three independent experiments gave a k′AHSP value of 10 ± 1.9 μm−1 s−1 for AHSPWT in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 at 22 °C. This bimolecular rate is not altered by oxidation of αWT heme iron to the ferric (met-α) state nor is the rate constant for αO2 binding appreciably different from that of αCO binding (see Fig. 1B, Table 1 in this paper, and Fig. 2A in Khandos et al.

A, fluorescence signal changes after rapidly mixing αCOWT with AHSPWT. Numbers in the right margin represent the postmixing nanomolar (nm) concentrations of αCOWT. Control reactions designed to account for the potential effects of photobleaching, precipitation, denaturation, and aggregation were performed, and no changes occurred on the time scales shown (data not shown; see Ref. 28Mollan T.L.

B, determination of bimolecular association rate constant for AHSPWT binding to both reduced and oxidized αWT (k′AHSP) under pseudo-first-order conditions. The lines represent fits to an expression derived from Reaction 1 with the y-intercept fixed to values of kAHSP measured directly by βCO displacement (Table 1 and Fig. 5). Buffers were bubbled with the indicated gases prior to use. To generate ferric αWT, a 5-fold molar excess of potassium ferricyanide was added to αO2WT prior to the experiment, and the samples were stored on ice to inhibit denaturation and precipitation of met-α.

https://openalex.org/W2016028168,"Species translocations are remarkable experiments in evolutionary ecology, and increasingly critical to biodiversity conservation. Elaborate socio-ecological hypotheses for translocation success, based on theoretical fitness relationships, are untested and lead to complex uncertainty rather than parsimonious solutions. We used an extraordinary 89 reintroduction and 102 restocking events releasing 682 black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) to 81 reserves in southern Africa (1981-2005) to test the influence of interacting socio-ecological and individual characters on post-release survival. We predicted that the socio-ecological context should feature more prominently after restocking than reintroduction because released rhinoceros interact with resident conspecifics. Instead, an interaction between release cohort size and habitat quality explained reintroduction success but only individuals' ages explained restocking outcomes. Achieving translocation success for many species may not be as complicated as theory suggests. Black rhino, and similarly asocial generalist herbivores without substantial predators, are likely to be resilient to ecological challenges and robust candidates for crisis management in a changing world."
https://openalex.org/W2001418705,"Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is an attractive therapeutic target for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as its high expression due to the loss of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) promotes RCC progression. Considering this, we hypothesized that ELR510444, a novel orally available small molecule inhibitor of HIF activity, would reduce angiogenesis and possess significant activity in RCC. The mechanism of action and therapeutic efficacy of ELR510444 were investigated in in vitro and in vivo models of RCC.ELR510444 decreased HIF-1α and HIF-2α levels, reduced RCC cell viability and clonogenic survival, and induced apoptosis. VHL-deficient RCC cells were more sensitive to ELR510444-mediated apoptosis and restoration of VHL promoted drug resistance. Higher concentrations of ELR51044 promoted apoptosis independently of VHL status, possibly due to the microtubule destabilizing properties of this agent. ELR510444 significantly reduced tumor burden in the 786-O and A498 RCC xenograft models. These effects were associated with increased necrosis and apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis.ELR510444 is a promising new HIF inhibitor that reduced RCC cell viability, induced apoptosis, and diminished tumor burden in RCC xenograft models. ELR510444 also destabilized microtubules suggesting that it possesses vascular disrupting and anti-angiogenic properties. Further investigation of ELR510444 for the therapy of RCC is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2019266757,"Regulation of human androgen biosynthesis is poorly understood. However, detailed knowledge is needed to eventually solve disorders with androgen dysbalance. We showed that starvation growth conditions shift steroidogenesis of human adrenal NCI-H295R cells towards androgen production attributable to decreased HSD3B2 expression and activity and increased CYP17A1 phosphorylation and 17,20-lyase activity. Generally, starvation induces stress and energy deprivation that need to be counteracted to maintain proper cell functions. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master energy sensor that regulates cellular energy balance. AMPK regulates steroidogenesis in the gonad. Therefore, we investigated whether AMPK is also a regulator of adrenal steroidogenesis. We hypothesized that starvation uses AMPK signaling to enhance androgen production in NCI-H295R cells. We found that AMPK subunits are expressed in NCI-H295 cells, normal adrenal tissue and human as well as pig ovary cells. Starvation growth conditions decreased phosphorylation, but not activity of AMPK in NCI-H295 cells. In contrast, the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AICAR) increased AMPKα phosphorylation and increased CYP17A1-17,20 lyase activity. Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor), directly inhibited CYP17A1 activities and can therefore not be used for AMPK signaling studies in steroidogenesis. HSD3B2 activity was neither altered by AICAR nor compound C. Starvation did not affect mitochondrial respiratory chain function in NCI-H295R cells suggesting that there is no indirect energy effect on AMPK through this avenue. In summary, starvation-mediated increase of androgen production in NCI-H295 cells does not seem to be mediated by AMPK signaling. But AMPK activation can enhance androgen production through a specific increase in CYP17A1-17,20 lyase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2079533815,"Alcohol dependence (AD) is a complex disorder characterized by psychiatric and physiological dependence on alcohol. AD is reflected by regular alcohol drinking, which is highly inheritable. In this study, to identify susceptibility genes associated with alcohol drinking, we performed a genome-wide association study of copy number variants (CNVs) in 2,286 Caucasian subjects with Affymetrix SNP6.0 genotyping array. We replicated our findings in 1,627 Chinese subjects with the same genotyping array. We identified two CNVs, CNV207 (combined p-value 1.91E-03) and CNV1836 (combined p-value 3.05E-03) that were associated with alcohol drinking. CNV207 and CNV1836 are located at the downstream of genes LTBP1 (870 kb) and FGD4 (400 kb), respectively. LTBP1, by interacting TGFB1, may down-regulate enzymes directly participating in alcohol metabolism. FGD4 plays a role in clustering and trafficking GABA(A) receptor and subsequently influence alcohol drinking through activating CDC42. Our results provide suggestive evidence that the newly identified CNV regions and relevant genes may contribute to the genetic mechanism of alcohol dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2024907332,"Mutational robustness of gene regulatory networks refers to their ability to generate constant biological output upon mutations that change network structure. Such networks contain regulatory interactions (transcription factor – target gene interactions) but often also protein-protein interactions between transcription factors. Using computational modeling, we study factors that influence robustness and we infer several network properties governing it. These include the type of mutation, i.e. whether a regulatory interaction or a protein-protein interaction is mutated, and in the case of mutation of a regulatory interaction, the sign of the interaction (activating vs. repressive). In addition, we analyze the effect of combinations of mutations and we compare networks containing monomeric with those containing dimeric transcription factors. Our results are consistent with available data on biological networks, for example based on evolutionary conservation of network features. As a novel and remarkable property, we predict that networks are more robust against mutations in monomer than in dimer transcription factors, a prediction for which analysis of conservation of DNA binding residues in monomeric vs. dimeric transcription factors provides indirect evidence."
https://openalex.org/W2009152709,"The presence of the translocator protein (TSPO), previously named as the mitochondrial or peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, in bone cells was studied in vitro and in situ using RT-qPCR, and receptor autoradiography using the selective TSPO ligand PK11195.In vitro, the TSPO is highly expressed in osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells.In situ, constitutive expression of TSPO is found in bone marrow and trabecular bone, e.g., spongiosa. Mice with a reduction of bone turnover induced by a 4-day treatment of osteoprotegerin reduces [(3)H]PK11195 binding in the spongiosa (320±128 Bq x mg(-1), 499±106 Bq x mg(-1) in saline-treated controls). In contrast, mice with an increase in bone turnover caused by a 4-day low calcium diet increases [(3)H]PK11195 binding in the spongiosa (615±90 Bq x mg(-1)). Further, our study includes technical feasibility data on [(18)F]fluoride microPET imaging of rodent bone with altered turnover. Despite [(18)F]fluoride having high uptake, the in vivo signal differences were small. Using a phantom model, we describe the spillover effect and partial volume loss that affect the quantitative microPET imaging of the small bone structures in experimental mouse models. In summary, we demonstrate the expression of TSPO in small rodent bone tissues, including osteoblasts and osteoclasts. A trend increase in TSPO expression was observed in the spongiosa from low to high bone turnover conditions. However, despite the potential utility of TSPO expression as an in vivo biomarker of bone turnover in experimental rodent models, our small animal PET imaging data using [(18)F]fluoride show that even under the condition of a good biological signal-to-noise ratio and high tracer uptake, the currently achievable instrument sensitivity and spatial resolution is unlikely to be sufficient to detect subtle differences in small structures, such as mouse bone."

https://openalex.org/W1984872025,"Prion diseases are fatal, transmissible neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. An abnormally protease-resistant and insoluble form (PrPSc) of the normally soluble protease-sensitive host prion protein (PrPC) is the major component of the infectious prion. During the course of prion disease, PrPSc accumulates primarily in the lymphoreticular and central nervous systems. Recent studies have shown that co-infection of prion-infected fibroblast cells with the Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) strongly enhanced the release and spread of scrapie infectivity in cell culture, suggesting that retroviral coinfection might significantly influence prion spread and disease incubation times in vivo. We now show that another retrovirus, the murine leukemia virus Friend (F-MuLV), also enhanced the release and spread of scrapie infectivity in cell culture. However, peripheral co-infection of mice with both Friend virus and the mouse scrapie strain 22L did not alter scrapie disease incubation times, the levels of PrPSc in the brain or spleen, or the distribution of pathological lesions in the brain. Thus, retroviral co-infection does not necessarily alter prion disease pathogenesis in vivo, most likely because of different cell-specific sites of replication for scrapie and F-MuLV."
