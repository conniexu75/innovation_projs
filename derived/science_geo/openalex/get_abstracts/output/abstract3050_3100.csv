https://openalex.org/W2030288420,"The endogenous morphinomimetic brain peptides Met5-enkephalin and alpha-, beta-, and gamma-endorphins have been evaluated in rats after intracerebrospinal fluid injection. beta-Endorphin produces marked, prolonged muscular rigidity and immobility similar to a catatonic state, counteracted by the opiate antagonist naloxone; this effect occurs at molar doses 1/100 to 1/400 that at which the other peptides or morphine block the response to painful stimuli. All peptides evoked dose-related, naloxone-reversible, wet-dog shakes in rats that had not been exposed to drugs. beta-Endorphin produced hypothermia, whereas gamma-endorphin produced hyperthermia. Such potent and divergent responses to naturally occurring subtances suggest that alterations in their homeostatic regulation could have etiological significance in mental illness."
https://openalex.org/W2004954672,"High molecular weight DNA, isolated from eleven cloned lines of rat cells independently transformed by SV40, was cleaved with various restriction endonucleases. The DNA was fractionated by electrophoresis through agarose gels, denatured in situ, transferred directly to sheets of nitrocellulose as described by Southern (1975), and hybridized to SV40 DNA labeled in vitro to high specific activity. The location of viral sequences among the fragments of transformed cell DNA was determined by autoradiography. The DNAs of seven of the cell lines contained viral sequences in fragments of many different sizes. The remaining four cell lines each contain a single insertion of viral DNA at a different chromosomal location. The junctions between viral and cellular sequences map at different places on the viral genome."

https://openalex.org/W2022424210,"The concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the activity of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) in rat and human pancreas were measured by sensitive assay methods. The GABA concentration in rat pancreas was 2.51 millimoles per kilogram (dry weight) and GAD activity was 2.58 mmoles per kilogram per hour. The GABA concentration and GAD activity in rat Langerhans' islets were 18.9 mmole kg-1 and 66.7 mmole kg-1 hour-1, whereas those in the exocrine acini were 1.97 mmole kg-1 and 4.67 mmole kg-1 hour-1, respectively. In an insulinoma region of human pancreas the GABA concentration was 25.5 mmole kg-1 and the GAD activity was 138.2 mmole kg-1 hour-1, but in the surrounding nontumor region these values were only 2.81 mmole kg-1 and 2.01 mmole kg-1 hour-1, respectively, similar to the values in normal rat pancreas."

https://openalex.org/W1589882347,"Adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) purified from silkworm pupae phosphorylated five major fractions of calf thymus histone, whereas guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase G) purified from the same organism reacted preferentially with H1, H2A, and H2B histones. Amino acid analysis of the phosphopeptides which were obtained by proteolytic digestion revealed that both protein kinases A and G showed the abilities to phosphorylate the same serine hydroxyl groups in H1 and H2B histones. Both protein kinases reacted with Ser-38 in H1 histone. With H2B histone as substrate protein kinase A phosphorylated Ser-32 as well as Ser-36, whereas protein kinase G reacted preferentially with Ser-32 and the reaction with Ser-36 was very slow. H3 and H4 histones were practically inactive substrates for protein kinase G. Although H2A histone has not been analyzed, the evidence has raised a possibility that protein kinase G utilizes a portion of the substrate proteins for protein kinase A."
https://openalex.org/W2084055173,"The absence of erythrocytic adenosine deaminase (ADA) or purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) has been associated with severe immunodeficiency disease in children. We have developed a cell culture model to study the possible relationships between purine salvage enzymes and immunologic function using an established T cell lymphosarcoma (S49) and a potent inhibitor of ADA, erythro-9(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA). Wild-type S49 cells are killed by dexamethasone or dbc AMP, and adenosine (5 muM) in the presence of an ADA inhibitor (6 muM EHNA) also prevents the growth of and kills these S49 cells. It has been proposed that adenosine is toxic to lymphoid cells by virtue of its ability to increase the intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP. We examined the sensitivity of three mutants of S49 cells, with distinctive defects in some component of cyclic AMP metabolism or action, to killing by adenosine and EHNA. All three mutants are resistant to killing by isoproterenol or cholera toxin and two are resistant to dbc AMP itself, but all are sensitive to killing by adenosine and EHNA. Similarly, two dexamethasone-resistant S49 mutants are as sensitive to adenosine and EHNA as are the wildtype cells. We have also simulated the purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency in S49 cells by adding inosine and adenosine to the growth medium. In the presence of EHNA or inosine, the toxic effects of adenosine can be partially reversed by addition of (10-20 muM) uridine, an observation suggesting that adenosine is toxic as the result of its inducing pyrimidine starvation."
https://openalex.org/W1588369232,"An assay based upon indirect immunoprecipitation has been developed for yeast cytochrome c and apocytochrome c. The specificity of this assay was demonstrated by its ability to selectively precipitate cytochrome c from an autolysate of yeast cell proteins. Translation of the polypeptide chain of cytochrome c in a wheat germ extract programmed with yeast poly(A) RNA was demonstrated using this immunoprecipitation assay. Translation of poly(A) RNA from yeast strains carrying nonsense mutations in the cyc1 gene yielded in vitro cytochrome c polypeptides which were shorter than the wild type protein by the amount expected for polypeptide chains which had terminated at the nonsense codon. The in vivo rate of cytochrome c synthesis was shown to be 6-fold greater in derepressed cells than in glucose-repressed cells. The 6-fold difference is sufficient to account for the 6-fold higher level of cytochrome c in derepressed than in repressed cells. The level of translatable cytochrome c mRNA is at least 4 times as high in derepressed as in glucose-repressed cells, suggesting that regulation occurs at some step in the synthesis of this messenger."
https://openalex.org/W1582082059,"Cytochrome oxidase, QH2-cytochrome c reductase, and the oligomycin-sensitive adenosine triphosphatase were incorporated into liposomes by a new procedure which yielded unidirectional orientation of the proteins. Cytochrome oxidase was reconstituted in the mitochrondrial orientation and the adenosine triphosphatase in the submitochondrial orientation. Reconstitutions were achieved by incubating the proteins at room temperature with liposomes which contained phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and an acidic phospholipid (cardiolipin, phosphatidylinositol, or phosphatidylserine). The incorporation occurred without added detergent or sonication. This incorporation procedure may serve as a model for the insertion of proteins in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1554830614,"Cultured dog thyroid cells were used to investigate the mechanism by which previous exposure to thyrotropin (TSH) induces refractoriness to further TSH stimulation of cellular adenosine 3'-5'-monophosphate (cAMP). Refractoriness of the cAMP response to TSH could not be overcome by exposure of the cells to supramaximal stimulatory concentrations of TSH. Although an unknown factor present in human and fetal calf serum was found to inhibit the thyroid cell cAMP response to TSH, this factor could not account for refractoriness because refractoriness could be induced in the absence of serum. Induction of thyroid refractoriness did not appear to be related to cellular concentrations of cyclic AMP, because equal refractoriness was produced by TSH alone or TSH plus the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methyl xanthine. In addition, preincubation of thyroid cells in 10(-4) M cAMP did not result in subsequent refractoriness. Recovery from the refractory process required almost 24 h. Short term (15 min) stimulation with TSH did not produce thyroid cell refractoriness, and reversal of the stimulation was obtained by thorough washing of the cells. Long term TSH stimulation (16 h), however, resulted in both supramaximal cAMP response to TSH, and inclusion of TSH together with cycloheximide did not produce refractoriness. Cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity in thyroid cell homogenate was unaltered by TSH or dibutyryl cyclic AMP pretreatment of the cells for up to 24 h, or cycloheximide for up to 4 h. In contrast, TSH-stimulated, but not F--stimulated, adenylate cyclase activity was reduced in thyroid cell homogenates after preincubation of the cells in TSH. Refractoriness to TSH stimulation was not associated with an alteration in the binding of 125I-TSH to cultured thyroid cells. These studies suggest that the thyroid cAMP response to TSH is modulated by an inhibitory mechanism dependent upon new protein synthesis. TSH stimulation itself increases the degree of this inhibition through a mechanism not involving cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1972542571,"The major capsid protein (VP1) of simian virus 40 (SV40) has been analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. This system separates protein according to isoelectric point by isoelectric-focusing, and according to molecular weight by sodium dodecylsulphate electrophoresis (O'Farrell, 1975). VP1 synthesis in infected CV-1 cells can be monitored directly by analysis of unfractionated whole cell extracts; the resolution of VP1 from cellular proteins allows its detection as early as 13 hr after infection. The two-dimensional separation of VP1 reveals that it is heterogeneous, consisting of one major protein (molecular weight 47,000 daltons and isoelectric point of approximately pH 6.8) and five minor protein components. The minor forms of VP1 are 10% of the total VP1 and differ from the major form of VP1 both in molecular weight (by approximately 500 daltons) and isoelectric point (ranging from approximately pH 6.7 to pH 6.9). Evidence is presented to show that two of the minor forms are phosphorylated derivatives of VP1, and it is further suggested that all the different forms of VP1 are the result of modifications of the primary product of translation. A temperature-sensitive mutant of the BC complementation group (BC11) of SV40 results in the synthesis of VP1 with an altered electrophoretic mobility; both the major form of VP1 and the minor forms are shifted in their isoelectric points. In addition to the specific case of SV40, two aspects of these studies should be generally significant to investigators studying eucaryotic gene expression by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis: first, the genetic origin of a protein can be determined by a temperature-sensitive mutation which causes a charge change in the resultant protein; and second, two or more protein spots on a two-dimensional separation may be the products of a single gene."

Histamine increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate and inhibits release of this enzyme. The H2 antihistamine metiamide blocks the histamine inhibition of lysosomal enzyme release and the increase in the intracellular adenosine 3,5′-monophosphate of granulocytes.

https://openalex.org/W1543183397,"The superoxide dismutase inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) was utilized to study the toxic effect of 1,4-naphthoquinone 2-sulfonate (NQ), a structural analog of the hemolytic drug, menadione, on red cells. NQ was shown to react with hemoglobin and result in the generation of superoxide anion (O2-). Red cells treated with NQ were found to undergo a gradual disappearance of their oxyhemoglobin and also hemolyze. Red cells pretreated with DDC to inhibit cellular superoxide dismutase were found to be markedly sensitive to oxyhemoglobin destruction and hemolysis in the presence of NQ. Superoxide dismutase-inhibited red cells were also found to undergo a slow autohemolysis in the absence of NQ. No evidence for lipid peroxidation was obtained for red cells treated with NQ either in the presence or the absence of DDC. Ghosts prepared from superoxide dismutase-inhibited red cells exposed to NQ were found to retain a green hemoglobin-derived pigment."
https://openalex.org/W1480120556,"Optical and EPR studies indicate that the iron present in lipoxygenase participates in catalysis. Addition of linoleic acid hydroperoxide to lipoxygenase 1 causes an increase in abosrbance over the range of 350 to 650 nm which is reversed when linoleic acid hydroperoxide is destroyed upon the addition of linoleic acid under anaerobic conditions. Lipoxygenase 1 alone exhibits no EPR signal but upon addition of linoleic acid hydroperoxide or linoleic acid several signals appear. Addition of linoleic acid hydroperoxide results in an EPR signal at g approximately equal to 6 accompanied by a small but relatively sharp signal at g approximately equal to 2. Under anaerobic conditions the latter is replaced by a broad anisotropic signal around g approximately equal to 2. The appearance of the EPR signal at g approximately equal to 6 coincides with the change in the optical spectrum of the enzyme. When linoleic acid is added under anaerobic conditions a broad anisotropic EPR signal around g approximately equal to 2 is observed. Thus it appears that lipoxygenase can exist in two forms: (a) a resting form with a very weak absorbance in the visible range of the light spectrum and no EPR signal and (b) an active form (after addition of linoleic acid hydroperoxide) with an increased optical absorbance and EPR signal at g approximately equal to 6. This observation may be related to the earlier discovery that the lipoxygenase reaction occurs with a lag which can be overcome by addition of product hydroperoxide. The EPR experiments indicate that lipoxygenase in the active form contains high spin ferric ion. Although EPR signals in the g approximately equal to 6 region are frequently observed with heme proteins, the only nonheme protein, other than lipoxygenase, reported to show an EPR signal in this region is the phenolytic dioxygenase, protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (Peisach, J., Fujisawa, H., Blumberg, W. E., and Hayaishi, O. (1972) Fed. Proc. 31, 448)."
https://openalex.org/W2016351483,"The 50S-70S RNA of a Moloney sarcoma-leukemia virus [Mo-MSV(MLV)] complex produced by a particular mouse cell line was shown by gel electrophoresis to contain a major (97%) 30S sarcoma-specific subunit species and a minor (3%) 38S leukemia virus-specific subunit. On the basis of its sedimentation coefficient and known complexity, the 30S Mo-MSV RNA was estimated to be a unique RNA molecule of about 6000 nucleotides. Hybridization experiments using viral RNA and DNA complementary to viral RNA (cDNA) made by viral DNA polymerase indicated that the 30S Mo-MSV RNA shared 70% of its sequences with Mo-MLV, 30% with another MLV derived from Mo-MLV, and 30% with Kirsten sarcoma-xenotropic leukemia virus. The 30S Mo-MSV RNA sequences shared with these viruses were not additive. The Tm of a Mo-MSV RNA-MLV cDNA hybrid was 83 degrees C, indicating that large contiguous nucleotide sequences were shared between the two nucleic acids. Mo-MSV RNA and Mo-MLV RNA shared possibly seven of 20-30 RNAase T1-resistant oligonucleotides, while Mo-MSV RNA contained three, and Mo-MLV RNA contained at least five specific oligonucleotides. We conclude that the 30S Mo-MSV RNA molecule consists of approximately 70% (about 4200 nucleotides) Mo-MLV-specific sequences and of 30% (1800 nucleotides) Mo-MSV-specific sequences covalently linked. Our results favor the hypothesis that 30S Mo-MSV RNA was generated by recombination between Mo-MLV and other genetic elements. We discuss whether all or only the MSV-specific sequences of the 30S Mo-MSV RNA function as sarcoma genes. Mo-MLV cDNA was hybridized about 45% by unfractionated Mo-MSV (MLV) RNA at RNA/DNA ratios of up to 10, about 50% by electrophoretically purified 30S Mo-MSV RNA at RNA/DNA ratios up to 500, but close to 100% by unfractionated Mo-MSV(MLV) RNA at RNA/DNA ratios over 900. This indicated that unfractionated RNA of our Mo-MSV(MLV) contained a complete complement of Mo-MLV, albeit at a low ratio."
https://openalex.org/W2036879096,"In normal human fibroblasts, the synthesis of a cell surface receptor for plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) is regulated by a sensitive system of feedback suppression. The number of functional LDL receptors declines by more than 20 fold when cellular stores of esterified cholesterol are increased by incubation of cells with an exogenous source of cholesterol. Fibroblasts from patients with the heterozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) possess one functional allele and one nonfunctional allele at the LDL receptor locus. In the current studies, we have examined the effect that this deficiency produces upon the pattern of regulation of the single functional allele at the LDL receptor locus. Under growth conditions that induced a maximal rate of LDL receptor synthesis (that is, growth in the absence of an exogenous source of cholesterol), the FH heterozygote cells produced about one half as many functional LDL receptors as did the normal cells. More importantly, when grown in the presence of increasing amounts of exogenous cholesterol, the FH heterozygote and normal cells suppressed their respective LDL receptor activities in parallel. Over a wide range of LDL receptor activities, at each level of cellular esterified cholesterol, the FH heterozygote cells expressed about one half as many receptors as did the normal cells. These data indicate that in the FH heterozygote cells, the receptor regulatory mechanism dictates that the normal allele produce only the amount of gene product that it would normally produce at a given level of cellular esterified cholesterol. The failure of the regulatory mechanism to stimulate the normal allele at the LDL receptor locus to produce twice its normal amount of gene product leaves the FH heterozygote cells with a persistent 50% deficiency in LDL receptors under all conditions of cell growth."

https://openalex.org/W1548557295,"Purified protein synthesis initiation factors IF-E2 and IF-E3 from rabbit reticulocytes were phosphorylated in vitro with protein kinases isolated from the same source. The highest levels of phosphorylation resulted from incubation of the factors with a cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase previously shown to have specificity for acidic proteins. The extent of phosphorylation of initiation factor IF-E2 was between 0.3 and 0.4 mol of phosphate per mol of factor complex, with either ATP or GTP as phosphoryl donor. Initiation factor IF-E2 is composed of three nonidentical polypeptides; only the polypeptide with a molecular weight of 52,000 was phosphorylated. The extent of phosphorylation of initiation factor IF-E3 was between 0.7 and 1.0 mol of phosphate per mol of factor complex with GTP as phosphoryl donor; with ATP, less phosphorylation of the factor was obtained. Initiation factor IF-E3 is composed of 9 to 11 nonidentical polypeptides; only 2 of these, with molecular weights of 120,000 and 70,000, were phosphorylated. A lower level of phosphorylation of initiation factor IF-E3 was found with the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase; the polypeptide of molecular weight 140,000 was the major site of phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2067122575,"Neurons in the buccal ganglia of Navanax inermis which control circumferential muscles of the pharynx showed typical electrotonic coupling when there was little synaptic activity in them. When there was much inhibitory activity, the effective sign of coupling was reversed; that is, hyperpolarization and depolarization of one cell caused depolarization and hyperpolarization of the others. A neural circuit explaining these results involes inhibitory neurons electronically coupled to and also inhibitory to the circumferential neurons that are themselves coupled. This circuit offers considerable flexibility for mediation of different activity patterns in this simple neuronal system."
https://openalex.org/W2167313334,"The effects of selected nucleotides (N) on the binding of myosin subfragment 1 (S-1) and pure F-actin (A) were measured by time-resolved fluorescence depolarization for 0.15 M KCl, pH 7.0 at 4 degrees. The association constants K'A, KN, and K'N in the scheme (see article), were determined for the magnesium salts of ADP, adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate AMP-P(NH)P, and PPi. The nucleotide binding site on S-1 was mapped with respect to its interaction on the actin binding site. The subsites were the beta- and gamma-phosphoryl groups of ATP bind had the largest effects. A quantitative measure of the interaction, the interaction free energy, was defined as -RT ln (KA/K'A). For ADP, K'A was 2.7 X 10(5) M-1 and the interaction free energy was -4.67 kJ M-1. For AMP-P(NH)P and PPi it was much larger. A ternary complex was shown to exist for ADP, S-1, and actin in the presence of Mg2+ and evidence from AMP-P(NH)P and PPi measurements indicated that ATP also likely forms a ternary complex. The mechanism of (S-1)-actin dissociation is discussed in light of these results."
https://openalex.org/W2031309015,"Sephadex gel filtration was used to characterize phosphomonoesterases in two small lakes in northern Sweden. Two fractions, here termed phosphatase A and phosphatase B, were found both as free enzymes and associated with seston. The activity of phosphatase A was correlated with the presence of algal biomass. Phosphatase B, on the other hand, was derived from zooplankton. Phosphate served as an effective inhibitor of phosphatase A but had no such effect on phosphatase B. Both fractions had pH optima between 6.5 and 7.0."
https://openalex.org/W1494948924,"The receptors for the polypeptide hormones, insulin and growth hormone, are located on the cell surface. Since the cytoplasmic microtubules and microfilaments are involved in the mobility and distribution of surface receptors for immunoglobulins and lectins, we investigated the role of these structures in the binding of insulin and human growth hormone to their receptors on cultured human lymphocytes (IM-9). Cells preincubated with microfilament modifiers, cytochalasin A, B, and D (10 mug/ml), had decreased binding of insulin (30%) and human growth hormone (60%) under steady state conditions, which was not reversed by removing the cytochalasins from the medium and was due entirely to a reduced number of receptor sites on the cell surfact. The lost receptors were not detected in the medium, suggesting a redistribution within the cell. The cytochalasins failed to alter the affinity of the hormones for their receptors or the negative cooperativity of the insulin receptor. The anti-microtubule agents (vincristine, vinblastine, colchicine) had no effect on the binding of insulin and growth hormone to their receptors. Deuterium oxide, a stabilizer of microtubules and other proteins, decreased the affinity (40%) of insulin for its receptors under steady state conditions and accelerated moderately the spontaneous dissociation of 125I-insulin from its receptors. Since cytochalasin decreases the number of available insulin and human growth hormone receptor sites, cytochalasin-sensitive microfilamentous structures appear to modulate the exposure of cell surface hormone receptors, while microtubules do not seem to be involved."
https://openalex.org/W1510591574,"The arginine kinase reaction, the reversible transfer of the terminal phosphoryl group of ATP to L-arginine, has been investigated by the technique of 31P NMR at catalytic and stoichiometric concentrations of the enzyme. Three of the four substrates, ATP, ADP, and P-arginine produce easily distinguishable resonances in the 31P NMR spectrum, thus permitting a determination of equilibrium constants from the integrated areas of the resonances. From the linewidths, the exchange rates between reactants and products may be evaluated. At pH 7.25 and a temperature of 12 degrees, the equilibrium constant at catalytic enzyme concentration: Keq = [MgADP] [P-arginine]/[MgATP] [L-arginine], is found to be 0.10 +/- 0.02 and that at stoichiometric enzyme concentration: K'eq = [E-MgADP] [E-P-arginine]/[E-MgATP] [E-arginine] to be 1.56 +/- 0.5. Thus, as the enzyme concentration increased, the production of P-arginine is increasingly favored. From the NMR line shapes in the presence of excess enzyme, the rate of the single step, the transfer of the phosphoryl group on the surface of the enzyme is found to be 192 +/- 15 s-1 in the forward direction, i.e. from E-MgATP, and 154 +/- 15 s-1 in the reverse direction from E-P-argine. At 12 degrees and pH 7.25, the rate of the overall reaction in the forward direction was determined from kinetic measurements to be 19 s-1, an order of magnitude slower than the rate measured by NMR. It can, therefore, be concluded that the interconversion of substrates on the surface of the enzyme is not the rate-determining step in the overal reaction. From the equilibrium constants and other known data the dissociation constant of P-arginine from its enzyme complex can be determined and is found to be 100 muM."
https://openalex.org/W1996203243,The sequence of 15 nucleotides located at the 5′ terminus of the plus strand of the SV40 Hind K fragment has been determined as (5′) A-G-C-T-T-A-T-G-A-A-G-A-T-G-G (3′). The 3′ OH terminal G of this segment is part of the G-C-C codeword for the N terminal alanine of the VP1 protein. This region therefore presumably corresponds to a ribosome binding site on the 16S late mRNA. Complementarity to the 3′ OH of eucaryotic 18S ribosomal RNA and homology with the BMV coat ribosome binding site are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1509166466,"Membrane phosphorylation and nucleoside triphosphatase activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle were studied using ATP and ITP as substrates. The Ca2+ concentration was varied over a range large enough to saturate either the high affinity Ca2+-binding site or both high and low affinity binding sites. In intact vesicles, which are able to accumulate Ca2+, the steady state level of enzyme phosphorylated by either ATP or ITP is already high in 0.02 mM Ca2+ and does not vary as the Ca2+ concentration is increased to 10 mM. Essentially the same pattern of membrane phosphorylation by ATP is observed when leaky vesicles, which are unable to accumulate Ca2+, are used. However, for leaky vesicles, when ITP is used as substrate, the phosphoenzyme level increases 3- to 4-fold when the Ca2+ concentration is raised from 0.02 to 20 mM. When Mg2+ is omitted from the assay medum, the degree of membrane phosphorylation by ATP varies with Ca2+ in the same way as when ITP is used in the presence of Mg2+. Membrane phosphorylation of leaky vesicles by either ATP or ITP is observed in the absence of added Mg2+. When these vesicles are incubated in media containing ITP and 0.1 mM Ca2+, addition of Mg2+ up to 10 mM simultaneously decreases the steady state level of phosphoenzyme and increases the rate of ITP hydrolysis. When ATP is used, the addition of 10 mM Mg2+ increases both the steady state level of phosphoenzyme and the rate of ATP hydrolysis. When the Ca2+ concentration is raised to 10 or 20 mM, the degree of membrane phosphorylation by either ATP or ITP is maximal even in the absence of added Mg2+ and does not vary with the addition of 10 mM Mg2+. In these conditions the ATPase and ITPase activities are activated by Mg2+, although not to the level observed in 0.1 mM Ca2+. An excess of Mg2+ inhibits both the rate of hydrolysis and membrane phosphorylation by either ATP or ITP."
https://openalex.org/W1570542714,"2-Fluoroadenosine (F-Ado) is a potent inhibitor of lymphocyte-mediated cytolysis studied in vitro. The inhibition of cytolysis by F-Ado was potentiated markedly by an inhibiotr (Ro 20-1724) of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase and, unlike the inhibition caused by adenosine, was irreversible when the cytotoxic lymphocytes were incubated with F-Ado and were then washed free of exogenous nucleoside. Incubation of cytotoxic lymphocytes with F-Ado resulted in the rapid, dose-dependent formation of 2-fluoroadenosine 5'-triphosphate (F-ATP); the build-up of F-ATP within these cells was accompanied by a reciprocal depletion of ATP. Once formed intracellularly, the F-ATP was not diminished during a subsequent 30-min incubation of the cells in F-Ado-free medium. 2-Fluoroadenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (F-cAMP), a novel compound, was synthesized chemically. This cAMP analogue was found to be highly cross-reactive in a radioimmunoassay specific for cAMP and to be equipotent to cAMP in its ability to activate a crude preparation of protein kinase derived from rat brain. A column chromatographic procedure was devised whereby F-cAMP and cAMP could be purified simultaneously from tissue extracts. Treatment of cytotoxic lymphocytes with F-Ado resulted in the formation of presumptive F-cAMP in amounts greater than that of cAMP, as determined by the concentration of F-Ado added to the medium and was not observed when the lymphocytes were incubated with either adenosine or 2-chloroadenosine, two agents which caused large increases in cAMP. The simultaneous presence of Ro 20-1724 enhances greatly the formation of F-cAMP from F-Ado without affecting the pool size of F-ATP. Removal of exogenous F-Ado from cells previously incubated with this drug and subsequent incubation of these cells in drug-free medium did not result in a substantial reduction in intracellular F-Ado (via prior incubation with F-Ado); 2'-deoxyadenosine was also effective in this capacity, while 9-beta-D-arabinofulanosyladenine was without effect. The level of cAMP was elevated transiently, in a dose-dependent manner, by F-Ado, and returned to control value after removal of exogenous F-Ado from the cells. Ro 20-1724 enhanced greatly this transient elevation of cAMP caused by F-Ado."
https://openalex.org/W1483988716,"Insulin rapidly produced an increase in per cent of total heart glycogen synthase in the I form in fed rats. In fasted rats the response was diminished and delayed. In diabetic animals there was no response over the 15-min time period studied. Since synthase phosphatase activity is necessary for synthase D to I conversion, the phosphatase activity was determined in extracts from these groups of animals. In the fasted and diabetic rats phosphatase activity was less than one-half of that in fed animals. Administration of insulin to fasting animals increased synthase phosphatase activity to a level approaching that of fed animals by 15 min. In diabetic animals insulin also stimulated an increase in synthase phosphatase activity but 30 min were required for full activation. Insulin had no effect in normal fed animals. Insulin activation of synthase phosphatase activity in heart extracts from fasted animals was still present after Sephadex G-25 chromatography and ammonium sulfate precipitation. Thus insulin had induced a stable modification of the phosphatase itself or of its substrate synthase D rendering the latter a more favorable substrate for the reaction. A difference in sensitivity of the reaction to glycogen inhibition was present between fed and fasted animals. Increasing concentrations of glycogen had only a slight inhibitory effect in extracts from fed animals but considerably reduced activity in extracts from fasted animals. Insulin administration reduced the sensitivity of the phosphatase reaction to glycogen inhibition. This could explain, at least in part, the increased phosphatase activity noted in the insulin-treated, fasted rats since glycogen was routinely added to the homogenizing buffer."
https://openalex.org/W1551772625,"The nucleotides 8-amino-, 8-methylamino-, and 8-dimethylaminoadenylic acid have been synthesized and their preferred conformations about the glycosyl bond in qaueous solution have been determined by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Paramagnetic relaxation studies, nuclear Overhauser enhancement measurements, chemical shifts, and coupling constant comparisons indicate that their is rotation about the glycosyl bond and that preference for either the anti or syn conformation depends on the extent of alkyl substitution on the 8-amino group. The primary and secondary amines 8-amino- and 8-methylaminoadenylic acid adopt a perferential anti conformation about the glycosyl bond, while the tertiary amine 8-dimethylaminoadenylic acid exists predominantly in the syn form. These three analogs provide a system to study interactions of a dehydrogenase with coenzyme inhibitors having different glycosyl conformer populations. All three analogs are competitive inhibitors of NADH in reaction with chicken muscle lactate dehydrogenase, and the Ki values show little dependence on the nature of the amino substitution. This demonstrates that the distribution of conformations about the nucleotide glycosyl bond does not effect the competition of the nucleotide for lactate dehydrogenase apoenzyme. Several models for enzyme-coenzyme binding are discussed. The available data cannot distinguish whether the enzyme binds nucleotide in both the anti and syn conformations or in purely the anti conformation. However, at some stage of the enzyme-coenzyme interaction, there appears to be a strong stabilization of the nucleotide in the anti conformation about the glycosyl bond."
https://openalex.org/W2076140415,"The 19S and 16S polyoma virus late mRNAs have been separated on sucrose-formamide density gradients and translated in vitro. The 16S RNA codes only for polyoma capsid protein VP1, while the 19S RNA codes in addition for capsid protein VP2. Since the 19S and 16S species have been previously mapped on the viral genome, these results allow us to deduce the location of the sequences coding for VP1 and VP2. Comparison of the chain lengths of the capsid proteins with the size of the viral mRNAs coding for them suggests that VP1 and VP2 are entirely virus-coded. Purified polyoma 19S RNA directs the synthesis of very little VP1 in vitro, although it contains all the sequences required to code for the protein. The initiation site for VP1 synthesis which is located at an internal position on the messenger is probably inactive either because it is inaccessible or because it lacks an adjacent ""capped"" 5' terminus. Similar inactive internal initiation sites have been reported for other eucarotic viral mRNAs (for example, Semliki forest virus, Brome mosaic virus, and tobacco mosaic virus), suggesting that while eucaryotic mRNAs may have more than one initiation site for protein synthesis, only those sites nearer the 5' terminus of the mRNA are active."
https://openalex.org/W1989712851,"1. Direct measurement of the electric current generation by cytochrome oxidase has been carried out. To this end, two procedures were used. The simpler one consists in formation of planar artificial membrane from the mixture of decane solution of soya bean phospholipids and beef heart cytochrome oxidase. Addition of cytochrome c and ascorbate to one of the two compartments separated by the cytochrome oxidase-containing planar membrane was found to result in a transmembrane electric potential difference being formed (plus on cytochrome c side of the membrane). Maximal values of potential differences obtained by this method were about 40 mV. Much higher potentials were observed when another (photeoliposome-planar membrane) method was applied. In this case cytochrome oxidase was reconstituted with phospholipid to form proteoliposomes which adhered to planar phospholipid membrane in the presence of Ca2+ ions. Addition of cytochrome c and ascorbate to the proteoliposome-containing compartment gives rise to generation of an electric potential difference across the planar membrane, which reached 100 mV at a current of about 1 X 10(-11) A (minus in the proteoliposome-free compartment). The electromotive force of this generator was estimated as being about 0.2 V. If ascorbate and proteoliposomes were added into different compartments, a penetrating hydrogen atom carrier (phenazine methosulfate, (PMS) or tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD)) was required for a membrane potential to be formed. Generation of an electric potential difference of the opposite direction (plus in the proteoliposome-free compartment) was revealed in experiments with cytochrome oxidase proteoliposome containing cytochrome c in their interior. In this case, addition of PMS or TMPD was necessary. 2. In the suspension of cytochrome oxidase proteoliposome the uptake of a cationic penetrant (tetraphenyl phosphonium cation) was found to be coupled with electron transfer via external cytochrome c. Electron transfer via intraproteoliposomal cytochrome c induced the uptake of anionic penetrants (tetraphenyl borate and phenyldicarbaundecaborane anions). 3. All the above effects were sensitive to cyanide and protonophorous uncouplers. 4. In proteoliposomes containing both cytochrome oxidase and bacteriorhodopsin, the light- and oxidation-dependent generations of membrane potential have been revealed. 5. The data obtained are in agreement with Mitchell's idea of transmembrane electron flow in the cytochrome oxidase segment of the respiratory chain."

https://openalex.org/W1553946369,"Abstract Incubation (30 degrees) of fat cell particulate fractions with fluoride before assay in the effective absence of fluoride results in activation of adenylate cyclase. Whereas the effect of fluoride (1.3 to 7 mM) when added to the assay was maximal in less than 2 min, 10 or 15 min of incubation before assay was usually required to produce maximal activation with any given concentration of fluoride. Under both conditions 3 to 5 mM fluoride produced maximal activation. After incubation with fluoride for 5 to 20 min cyclase activity was constant for at least 15 min of assay without fluoride; maximal activity was greater than that produced by fluoride added to the assay system and the concentration required to produce significant activation was lower. Fluoride activation in the assay or during prior incubation could be prevented by pyrophosphate. When added during the early minutes of assays with fluoride, 1.5 mM pyrophosphate, which had little effect on the activity of enzyme previously incubated with fluoride, rapidly reduced activity to essentially basal levels; when added after 10 min its effect was equally rapid but much smaller. It appears that activation is initially reversible by removal of fluoride as it is by addition of pyrophosphate, but becomes largely irreversible by these means with continued exposure to fluoride. Fluoride in the assay system inhibited cyclase activated by isoproterenol or choleragen or by incubation with fluoride prior to assay; inhibition, dependent on fluoride concentration, was maximal at 5.3 mM. Since maximal activity produced by incubation with fluoride before assay exceeded that of nonincubated preparations assayed with fluoride, and was reduced to the latter level when assayed in the presence of fluoride, we infer that inhibition is reversible at a time when fluoride activation is relatively irreversible. Pyrophosphate (1.5 mM), which prevented fluoride activation, did not reduce fluoride inhibition of isoproterenol-, fluoride-, or choleragen-activated cyclase. When 3 mM MnCl2 was present in the assay, inhibition by fluoride was not observed. In descriptive terms, MnCl2 appeared to cause rapid reversal of fluoride inhibition. Thus, fluoride inhibits, in an apparently similar manner, fat cell adenylate cyclase whether it is activated by isoproterenol, fluoride, or choleragen. Although fluoride activation and inhibition can apparently be dissociated or modified differentially, until the mechanism(s) of action of fluoride is elucidated it cannot be concluded that these are totally independent processes."
https://openalex.org/W1556860936,"N6,O2-Dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (Bt2cAMP) inhibits gluconeogenesis and lactate formation but increases ketogenesis by isolated liver cells incubated with high concentrations of pyruvate. The inhibitory effects can not be explained on the basis of an inhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex nor by a change in the NAD+ oxidation-reduction potential of the mitochondrial compartment. Both oleate and 3-hydroxybutyrate substantially increase the rates of gluconeogenesis and lactate formation from pyruvate but do not overcome the inhibition caused by Bt2cAMP. A decreased effectiveness of pyruvate kinase is proposed to account for the inhibition of both gluconeogenesis and lactate formation by Bt2cAMP. This enzyme catalyzes a step required in the transfer of reducing equivalents from the mitochondrial compartment to the cytoplasm and participates in the formation of glucose and lactate from pyruvate by the overall reaction: 2 pyruvate- + 2 NADHmito + 4 ATP4- + 4 H2O leads to 1/2 glucose + lactate- + 2 NAD+ mito + 4 ADP3- + 4 HPO4(2)- + H+. Inhibition of pyruvate kinase promotes gluconeogenesis with most substrates but inhibits gluconeogenesis from pyruvate for want of cytoplasmic reducing equivalents."
https://openalex.org/W21066260,"The equilibrium constant of the reaction catalyzed by acetate kinase (E.C. 2.7.2.1.) was determined: K = (MgADP) (acetylphosphate)/(MgATP)(acetate) = 6.7 +/- 1.3 X 10 (-4) (pH 7.4, 25 degrees). The respective free nucleotides uncomplexed to magnesium inhibit the net reaction in both directions: competitively with the respective magnesium nucleotide (MgATP or MgADP) and noncompetitively with the co-substrate (acetate or acetylphosphate). Excess free magnesium also inhibits the net reaction in both directions. The inhibition is not competitive with the phosphoryl donor (MgATP or acetylphosphate) but is competitive with respect to the phosphoryl acceptor (acetate or MgADP). A 50-fold increase in concentration of reactants at equilibrium in 0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, at 25 degrees resulted in a rise to plateau levels of the acetate equilibrium acetylphosphate exchange rate (measured with [U-14C]acetate) and of the ATP equilibrium ADP exchange rate (measured with [U-14C]ADP and 10-fold higher than acetate equilibrium acetylphosphate), suggesting that there is no compulsory order of binding of magnesium nucleotide and co-substrate and that all chemical transformation steps cannot be much slower than the dissociation steps. The ATP equilibrium ADP exchange rate was independent of the presence or concentration of co-substrate, whereas the acetate equilibrium acetylphosphate exchange reaction occurred only in the presence of magnesium nucleotide, and the rate was directly related to the degree of saturation of enzyme with magnesium nucleotide. The independent ATP equilibrium ADP exchange, which presumably involves a phosphoenzyme intermediate, was progressively inhibited by increasingly elevated MgADP concentrations (when MgADP/MgATP greater than or equal 5), but increasing MgATP/MgADP was not inhibitory, suggesting that MgADP may bind to nonphosphorylated as well as phosphorylated enzyme, but that MgATP cannot bind to phosphorylated enzyme. While direct transfer of the phosphoryl group between nucleotide and co-substrate in a concerted mechanism has not been ruled out, an activated ping pong mechanism can also be proposed which is compatible with the isotopic exchange and initial net rate kinetic results. This mechanism includes a phosphoenzyme intermediate and requires enzyme-bount MgADP for phosphorylation of the enzyme by acetylphosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1588590018,"Abstract Primary cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts were used to study ribosomal events in the processing of procollagen. Polyribosomes from radiolabeled cells were subjected to enzyme probe analysis using collagenase and pepsin digestion to assess both the amount of procollagen present on the polyribosomes and the conformation of the molecule. The peptides rendered dialyzable by each enzyme treatment were analyzed for radioactive proline and hydroxyproline. Approximately 30% of the nascent proteins were collagenous. Although some hydroxyproline was dialyzable in the pepsin-treated material, a low ratio of hydroxyproline to proline (0.04) indicated that considerable amounts of noncollagenous proteins were digested. Polyribosomal material, previously treated with pepsin, was digested with purified collagenase. Similarly, collagenase-digested polyribosomes were treated with pepsin. The pepsin pretreatment released noncollagenous protein and served to purify the remaining ribosomally bound pepsin-resistant collagenous protein. Collagenase treatment of the pepsin-resistant ribosomally bound peptides released peptides with a hydroxyproline to proline ratio of 0.65, indicating that considerable hydroxylation of proline occurs on nascent ribosomally bound procollagen. This finding combined with the well documented stabilizing effect of hydroxyproline on the collagen triple helix and the demonstrated resistance of ribosomally bound procollagen to pepsin digestion indicates that the collagen triple helix may well form on the polyribosome."

https://openalex.org/W1516035367,"Abstract The in vivo conversion of several 5 beta-cholestane intermediates to primary bile acids was investigated in three patients with total biliary diversion. The following compounds were administered intravenously: 5 beta-[G-3H]-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha-diol, 5 beta-[G-3H]cholestane-3 alpha, 7alpha, 26-triol, and 5 beta-[24-14C]cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha-25-triol. Bile was then collected quantitatively at frequent intervals for the next 21 to 28 h. The administered 5 beta-[G-3H]cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 26-triol was found to be efficiently converted to cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids in two patients; 61 and 75% of the administered label was found in primary bile acids. The proportion of labeled cholic to chenodeoxycholic acid was 1.20 and 1.02 in the bile of these patients, indicating that the C-26 triol was efficiently converted to cholic acid. The ratio of cholic to chenodeoxycholic acid (mass) in the bile of these patients was 1.23 and 2.32. The 5 beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha-diol intermediate was also efficiently converted (71%) to both primary bile acids. The cholic to chenodeoxycholic acid ratios by mass and label were similar (2.97 versus 2.23). By contrast, the 5beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 25-triol was poorly converted to bile acids in three patients. Following the administration of this compound almost all of the administered radioactivity found in the bile acid fraction was in cholic acid (5 to 19%) and very little (less than 5%) was found in chenodeoxycholic acid. These findings indicate that ring hydroxylation at position 12 is not materially hindered by the presence of a hydroxyl group on the side chain at C-26 in patients with biliary diversion. The labeled C-26-triol which was efficiently converted to both primary bile acids in a proportion similar to that which was observed for the bile acids synthesized by the liver suggests that this 5beta-cholestane derivative may be a major intermediate in the synthesis of both cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids."

A fragment (about 140 base pairs in length) containing essentially all the repetitive monkey DNA present in the defective and few, if any, SV40 sequences can be cleaved from the purified defective DNA by restriction endonucleases Hind(II and III). Radioactive cRNA prepared with the isolated fragment as template was hybridized in situ to African green monkey chromosomes.

https://openalex.org/W1633093785,"Abstract The observed equilibrium constants (Kobs) of the P-choline hydrolysis reaction have been determined under physiological conditions of temperature (38 degrees) and ionic strength (0.25 M) and physiological ranges of pH and free [Mg2+]. Using sigma and square brackets to indicate total concentrations: (see article.) The value of Kobs has been found to be relatively insensitive to variations in pH and free [Mg2+]. At pH 7.0 and taking the standard state of liquid water to have unit activity ([H2O] = 1), Kobs = 26.6 M at free [Mg2+] = 0 [epsilon G0obs = -2.03 kcal/mol(-8.48 kJ/mol)], 26.8 M at free [Mg2+] = 10(-3) M, and 28.4 M at free [Mg2+] = 10(-2) M. At pH 8.0, Kobs = 18.8 M at free [Mg2+] = 0, 19.2 M at free [Mg2+] = 10(-3), and 22.2 M at free [Mg2+] = 10(-2) M. These values apply only to situations where choline and Pi concentrations are both relatively low (such as the conditions found in most tissues). At higher concentrations of phosphate and choline, the value of Kobs becomes significantly increased since HPO42- complexes choline weakly (association constant = 3.3 M-1). The value of K at 38 degrees and I = 0.25 M is calculated to be 16.4 +/- 0.3 M [epsilonG0 = 1.73 kcal/mol (-7.23 kJ/mol)]. The K for the P-choline hydrolysis reaction has been combined with the K for the ATP hydrolysis reaction determined previously under physiological conditions to calculate a value of 4.95 X 10(-3 M [deltaG0 j.28 kcal/mol (13.7 kJ/mol] for the K of the choline kinase reaction (EC 2.7.1.32), an important step in phospholipid metabolism: (see article.) Likewise, values for Kobs for the choline kinase reaction at 38 degrees, pH 7.0, and I = 0.25 M have been calculated to be 5.76 X 10(4) [deltaG0OBS = -6.77 KCAL/MOL (-28.3 KJ/mol)] at [Mg2+] = 0; 1.24 X 10(4) [deltaG0obs = -5.82 kcal/mol (-24.4 kJ/mol)] at [Mg2+] = 10(-3) M and 8.05 X 10(3) [delta G0obs = -5.56 kcal/mol (-23.3 kJ/mol)] at [Mg2+ = 10(-2) M. Attempts to determine the Kobs of the choline kinase reaction directly were unsuccessful because of the high value of the constant. The results indicate that in contrast to the high deltaG0obs for the hydrolysis of the ester bond of acetylcholine, the deltaG0obs for the hydrolysis of the ester bond of P-choline is quite low, among the lowest known for phosphate ester bonds of biological interest."
https://openalex.org/W2013172333,"5' terminal nucleosides of nuclear pre-mRNA of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells were analyzed by a combination of different chromatographic methods and phosphatase treatment. The heavy nuclear pre-mRNA contains mainly unblocked triphosphorylated nucleosides at the 5' end, although some capped 5' ends could also be found. In this respect, it differs from cytoplasmic poly(A)+ mRNA which contains blocked 5' termini and no triphosphorylated ends. The 5' terminal nucleotides in pre-mRNA are pppGp and pppAp (in a ratio of 3:2). The determination of pppNp content in poly (A)+, poly(U)+, and poly (A)-(U)- fragments of RNA has been used as an approach to establish the topography of pre-mRNA. We also established that the technique for isolation of triphosphorylated 5' terminal fragments of RNA based on hydroxyapatite chromatography (Bajszár, Samarina, and Georgiev, 1974) is still valid in the presence of blocked oligonucleotides. The latter do not interfere with fragments containing free triphosphate groups. Using this technique, we showed that a small but significant portion of triphosphorylated 5' end fragments of 100 nucleotides in length contain oligo(U) sequences reacting with poly(A)-Sepharose."

The biphasic kinetics and X-azolidine-like structure formed were similar to those observed for mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (Wimmer, M.J., Mo, T., Sawyers, D.L., and Harrison, J.H. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 710-715). In the cytoplasmic enzyme, however, irreversible inactivation representing X-azolidine formation was found to be the dominant characteristic of the interaction with pyridoxal-5'-P. Spectral evidence indicated that at total inactivation 2 mol of pyridoxal-5'-P were incorporated per mol of enzyme or one pyridoxal-5'-P per enzymatic active site. The presence of NADH protected the enzyme from inactivation suggesting interaction of pyridoxal-5'-P at or near the enzymatic active centers of this enzyme. Fluorometric titrations indicated that pyridoxal-5'-P-inactivated enzyme failed to bind NADH or at least failed to bind NADH in the same fashion as native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1592740627,"In vitro recombination of lipids with apolipoproteins is achieved when a concentrated solution of plasma lipids in petroleum ether is mixed with delipidated plasma. Combination of phospholipids and unesterified fatty acids are observed in amounts comparable with those originally present in the native unextracted plasma; triglycerides combine partially and cholesterol only slightly. On agarose gel immunoelectrophoresis, a component in the delipidated plasma which is reactive with high density lipoprotein antibodies migrates more slowly than high density lipoprotein in the undelipidated control plasma. However, the component reacting with low density lipoprotein antibodies in the delipidated plasma moves more rapidly than low density lipoprotein in the native plasma. These changes are reversed by recombination of lipid with delipidated plasma. All lipids present in the plasma phase after relipidation travel with the lipoproteins during zonal electrophoresis. The apparent concentrations of proteins reacting with high density and low density lipoprotein antibodies decrease when no lipid is present in plasma on assay by single radial immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis, using commercially available lipoprotein antibodies. On relipidation, full immunochemical properties of high density lipoprotein are restored, but relipidated low density lipoprotein exhibits only partial immunochemical restoration."

To this end, enzyme and cytochrome profiles were determined for mitochondria, microsomes, and nuclear membrane fractions isolated from livers of R. catesbeiana tadpoles which had been fasted for 6 days at 15 +/- 0.5 degrees and then immersed in thyroxine, 2.6 X 10(-8) M, for periods of up to 12 days at 23.5 +/- 0.4 degrees. The ratio of total succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity in the initial homogenate fraction to the total activity of this mitochondrial marker enzyme recovered in the final mitochondrial fraction remained constant, approximately 0.5, throughout the course of thyroxine treatment; however, after a 3- to 4-day latency the mitochondrial protein mass recovered per unit mass of initial homogenate protein was found to increase significantly (approximately 2-fold by Day 10 of thyroxine treatment). A similar increase was also observed in the yield of microsomal, but not nuclear membrane, protein mass as a function of thyroxine treatment. Prolonged thyroxine treatment (12 days) resulted in approximately 50% decreases in tadpole liver homogenate and microsomal NADH-cytochrome c reductase specific activities; in contrast, mitochondrial and nuclear membrane NADH-cytochrome c reductase specific activities were not altered under the same conditions. In addition, homogenate and microsomal NADPH-cytochrome c reductase specific activities were found to have increased significantly after 12 days of thyroxine treatment; however, the specific activity of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase in the mitochondrial fraction was unchanged. It was also observed that thyroxine treatment resulted in increases in homogenate and microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase specific activities, whereas the mitochondrial as well as nuclear membrane glucose-6-phosphatase specific activities remained unchanged. Furthermore, in contrast to homogenate and mitochondrial monoamine oxidase specific activities, which decreased 30 and 40%, respectively, as a consequence of thyroxine treatment (12 days), the succinate-cytochrome c reductase and oligomycin-sensitive Mg2+ ATPase specific activities determined for these fractions increased significantly. In all instances, changes as a result of thyroxine treatment in membrane-localized homogenate or organelle enzyme specific activities were apparent only after a 3- to 4-day initial latent period. The in vitro effects of thyroxine (10(-10) - 10(-5) M) on the membrane-localized enzyme activities examined in this study were either negligible or, as in the case of mitochondrial succinate-cytochrome c reductase and microsomal NADH-cytochrome c reductase, opposite to the changes observed in response to in vivo thyroxine treatment, with the exception of microsomal NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity which was enhanced approximately 2-fold by 10(-5) M thyroxine..."

https://openalex.org/W1593238473,"Human apohemoglobin (globin) was spin-labeled at the beta-93 sulfhydryl groups with 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-aminopyrrolidine-I-oxyl. Spin-labeled globin exhibited an EPR spectra that is less immobilized than that of spin-labeled hemoglobin, indicating the conformational difference in the vicinity of the label between hemoglobin and globin. Spectrophotometric titration of spin-labeled globin with protohemin showed that 1 mol of globin (on the tetramer basis) combines with 4 mol of hemin, producing a holomethemoglobin spectrophotometrically indistinguishable from native methemoglobin. The EPR spectrum was also changed strikingly upon the addition of protohemin. This change, however, was not proportional to the amount of hemin added, but marked changes occurred after 3 to 4 mol of hemin were mixed with 1 mol of spin-labeled globin. The EPR spectrum of spin-labeled hemoglobin thus prepared was identical with that prepared by direct spin labeling to methemoglobin. These results suggest the preferential binding of hemin to alpha-globin chains in the course of heme binding by globin. This assumption was further confirmed by preparing spin-labeled semihemoglobin in which only one kind of chain contained hemin (alpha h betaO SL and alpha O beta h SL). The EPR spectrum of the alpha h beta O SL molecule showed a slightly immobilized EPR spectrum, similar to that of spin-labeled globin mixed with 50% of the stoichiometric amount of hemin. On the other hand, the alpha O beta h SL molecule showed a distinctly different EPR signal from that of globin half-saturated with hemin, and showed an intermediate spectrum between those of beta h SL and alpha h beta h SL. These results indicate that heme binding to globin chains brings about a major conformational change in the protein moiety and that chain-chain association plays a secondary role. We conclude that hemin binds preferentially to alpha-globin chains and that the conformation of globin changes rapidly to that of methemoglobin after all four hemes are attached to globin heme pockets."
