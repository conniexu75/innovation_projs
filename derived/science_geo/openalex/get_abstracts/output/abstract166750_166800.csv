https://openalex.org/W2033787520,"We have characterized the fundamental photoluminescence (PL) properties of individual, isolated indium phosphide (InP) nanowires to define their potential for optoelectronics. Polarization-sensitive measurements reveal a striking anisotropy in the PL intensity recorded parallel and perpendicular to the long axis of a nanowire. The order-of-magnitude polarization anisotropy was quantitatively explained in terms of the large dielectric contrast between these free-standing nanowires and surrounding environment, as opposed to quantum confinement effects. This intrinsic anisotropy was used to create polarization-sensitive nanoscale photodetectors that may prove useful in integrated photonic circuits, optical switches and interconnects, near-field imaging, and high-resolution detectors."

Screening for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has led to earlier detection of prostate cancer, but elevated serum PSA levels may be present in non-malignant conditions such as benign prostatic hyperlasia (BPH). Characterization of gene-expression profiles that molecularly distinguish prostatic neoplasms may identify genes involved in prostate carcinogenesis, elucidate clinical biomarkers, and lead to an improved classification of prostate cancer. Using microarrays of complementary DNA, we examined gene-expression profiles of more than 50 normal and neoplastic prostate specimens and three common prostate-cancer cell lines. Signature expression profiles of normal adjacent prostate (NAP), BPH, localized prostate cancer, and metastatic, hormone-refractory prostate cancer were determined. Here we establish many associations between genes and prostate cancer. We assessed two of these genes-hepsin, a transmembrane serine protease, and pim-1, a serine/threonine kinase-at the protein level using tissue microarrays consisting of over 700 clinically stratified prostate-cancer specimens. Expression of hepsin and pim-1 proteins was significantly correlated with measures of clinical outcome. Thus, the integration of cDNA microarray, high-density tissue microarray, and linked clinical and pathology data is a powerful approach to molecular profiling of human cancer."

The resulting double mutant (tau/APP) progeny and the Tg2576 parental strain developed Aβ deposits at the same age; however, relative to JNPL3 mice, the double mutants exhibited neurofibrillary tangle pathology that was substantially enhanced in the limbic system and olfactory cortex. These results indicate that either APP or Aβ influences the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. The interaction between Aβ and tau pathologies in these mice supports the hypothesis that a similar interaction occurs in Alzheimer's disease."

Injection of beta-amyloid Abeta42 fibrils into the brains of P301L mutant tau transgenic mice caused fivefold increases in the numbers of NFTs in cell bodies within the amygdala from where neurons project to the injection sites. Gallyas silver impregnation identified NFTs that contained tau phosphorylated at serine 212/threonine 214 and serine 422. NFTs were composed of twisted filaments and occurred in 6-month-old mice as early as 18 days after Abeta42 injections. Our data support the hypothesis that Abeta42 fibrils can accelerate NFT formation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1501881225,"In mammals, the canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway activated in response to infections is based on degradation of IκB inhibitors. This pathway depends on the IκB kinase (IKK), which contains two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ. IKKβ is essential for inducible IκB phosphorylation and degradation, whereas IKKα is not. Here we show that IKKα is required for B cell maturation, formation of secondary lymphoid organs, increased expression of certain NF-κB target genes, and processing of the NF-κB2 (p100) precursor. IKKα preferentially phosphorylates NF-κB2, and this activity requires its phosphorylation by upstream kinases, one of which may be NF-κB–inducing kinase (NIK). IKKα is therefore a pivotal component of a second NF-κB activation pathway based on regulated NF-κB2 processing rather than IκB degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2164442956,"Following their discovery, carbon nanotubes have attracted interest not only for their unusual electrical and mechanical properties, but also because their hollow interior can serve as a nanometre-sized capillary, mould or template in material fabrication. The ability to encapsulate a material in a nanotube also offers new possibilities for investigating dimensionally confined phase transitions. Particularly intriguing is the conjecture that matter within the narrow confines of a carbon nanotube might exhibit a solid-liquid critical point beyond which the distinction between solid and liquid phases disappears. This unusual feature, which cannot occur in bulk material, would allow for the direct and continuous transformation of liquid matter into a solid. Here we report simulations of the behaviour of water encapsulated in carbon nanotubes that suggest the existence of a variety of new ice phases not seen in bulk ice, and of a solid-liquid critical point. Using carbon nanotubes with diameters ranging from 1.1 nm to 1.4 nm and applied axial pressures of 50 MPa to 500 MPa, we find that water can exhibit a first-order freezing transition to hexagonal and heptagonal ice nanotubes, and a continuous phase transformation into solid-like square or pentagonal ice nanotubes."

We used an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation paradigm in which the response to pairs of successively presented stimuli is lower when they are identical than when they are different. Adaptation across a change between the two stimuli in a pair provides evidence for a common neural representation invariant to that change. We found adaptation in the LOC when perceived shape was identical but contours differed, but not when contours were identical but perceived shape differed. These data indicate that the LOC represents not simple image features, but rather higher level shape information."

Here we show that when a large amount of water is added to olivine, the relation between flow geometry and seismic anisotropy undergoes marked changes. Some of the puzzling observations of seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle, including the anomalous anisotropy in the central Pacific and the complicated anisotropy in subduction zones, can be attributed to the enrichment of water in these regions."

A catalytic mechanism, featuring a long-lived oxocarbenium-ion intermediate, was proposed on the basis of model-building studies2. The ‘Phillips’ mechanism is widely held as the paradigm for the catalytic mechanism of β-glycosidases that cleave glycosidic linkages with net retention of configuration of the anomeric centre. Studies with other retaining β-glycosidases, however, provide strong evidence pointing to a common mechanism for these enzymes that involves a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, as previously postulated3. Here we show, in three different cases using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, a catalytically competent covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate during the catalytic cycle of HEWL. We also show the three-dimensional structure of this intermediate as determined by X-ray diffraction. We formulate a general catalytic mechanism for all retaining β-glycosidases that includes substrate distortion, formation of a covalent intermediate, and the electrophilic migration of C1 along the reaction coordinate."

The target embryo sac may attract the pollen tube as the final step of guidance in the pistil. We show by laser cell ablation that two synergid cells adjacent to the egg cell attract the pollen tube. A single synergid cell was sufficient to generate an attraction signal, and two cells enhanced it. After fertilization, the embryo sac no longer attracts the pollen tube, despite the persistence of one synergid cell. This cessation of attraction might be involved in blocking polyspermy."

Two HIV proteins, Nef and Tat, increase T cell activity, but a requirement of integration for viral gene expression would preclude a role for these proteins in resting cells. Here, we report that HIV infection leads to selective transcription of the nef and tat genes before integration. This preintegration transcription in quiescent cells leads to increased T cell activation and viral replication."

Until the Tagish Lake fall, these asteroids had no analog in the meteorite collections. The Tagish Lake meteorite is a carbon-rich (4 to 5 weight %), aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrite and contains high concentrations of presolar grains and carbonate minerals, which is consistent with the expectation that the D-type asteroids were originally made of primitive materials and did not experience any extensive heating."

https://openalex.org/W2076961303,"About half of the stable nuclei heavier than iron are believed to be synthesized during the late stages of evolution of stars with masses in the range 0.8–8 solar masses. These elements are then expelled into the interstellar medium through stellar winds after being ‘dredged up’ towards the surface of the stars. These processes occur when the star is in the ‘asymptotic giant branch’ (AGB) phase of its life. Nuclei (mainly iron) deep inside the star slowly capture neutrons and progressively build up heavier elements (the ‘s-process’). For AGB stars that formed early in the history of the Galaxy, and that therefore have very low abundances of elements heavier than helium (‘metals’), models1 predict that the s-process will accumulate synthesized material with atomic weights in the Pb–Bi region. Such stars will therefore have large overabundances of lead relative to other heavy elements. Here we report the discovery of large amounts of lead in three metal-poor stars (HD187861, HD196944 and HD224959). Our analysis shows that these stars are more enriched in lead than in any other element heavier than iron. The excellent agreement between the observed and predicted abundances reinforces our current understanding of the detailed operation of the s-process deep in the interiors of AGB stars."
https://openalex.org/W2313004864,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors sodium butyrate and trichostatin A arrest human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive carcinoma cells in G1 to S transition of the cell cycle, which is paralleled by an up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) p21CIP1 and p27KIP1 as well as the complete loss of cdk2 activity. Although HPV expression was hitherto thought to be required to maintain a proliferative phenotype of these cells, cdk2 suppression is achieved even in the presence of ongoing viral transcription. While CKIs normally cannot exert their cdk2-inhibitory function in the presence of the viral oncoprotein E7, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that E7 binding is prevented. Increase of p27KIP1 correlates with down-regulation of p45SKP2, a component of the ubiquitin-protein ligase SCFSKP2 controlling the half-life of regulatory proteins during the cell cycle. HDAC inhibition also triggered an E7-dependent degradation of pRb, while the levels of E2F remained unaffected. The presence of free intracellular E2F and the concomitant up-regulation of CKIs during G1 arrest results in a ‘conflicting growth situation’, which finally renders the cells to undergo apoptosis. These data provide novel molecular insights into how the transforming potential of HPV can be bypassed and open new therapeutical perspectives for the treatment of cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2126963964,"We report the discovery of an ultradense post-rutile polymorph of titanium dioxide in shocked gneisses of the Ries crater in Germany. The microscopic diagnostic feature is intense blue internal reflections in crossed polarizers in reflected light. X-ray diffraction studies revealed a monoclinic lattice, isostructural with the baddeleyite ZrO 2 polymorph, and the titanium cation is coordinated with seven oxygen anions. The cell parameters are as follows: a = 4.606(2) angstroms, b = 4.986(3) angstroms, c = 4.933(3) angstroms, β (angle between c and a axes) = 99.17(6)°; space group P2 1 /c ; density = 4.72 grams per cubic centimeter, where the numbers in parentheses are standard deviations in the last significant digits. This phase is 11% denser than rutile. The mineral is sensitive to x-ray irradiation and tends to invert to rutile.

Double-exponential behavior of the time-dependent escape probability was observed, suggesting the occurrence of a two-level decay-tunneling process in which energy relaxation from the excited to the ground level significantly affects the escape dynamics of the system. The observation of temporal double-exponential dependence enables direct measurements of the DIDT, a property critical to the study of quantum dynamics and the realization of macroscopic quantum coherence and quantum computing. We found that the DIDT was τ d &gt; 11 μs at T = 0.55 K, demonstrating good prospects for implementing quantum computing with Josephson devices."

The diversity among these structures implies that there is a common ground state that selector genes modify to generate these different appendage morphologies. Here we show that the ventral appendage that forms in the absence of selector gene activity is leglike but consists of only two segments along its proximo-distal axis: a proximal segment and a distal tarsus. These results raise the possibility that, during evolution, leglike appendages could have developed without selector gene activity."

https://openalex.org/W1971044323,"In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the oncogene bcr-abl encodes a dysregulated tyrosine kinase that inhibits apoptosis. We showed previously that human erythroleukemia K562 cells are resistant to antineoplastic drug (taxol)-induced apoptosis through the atypical protein kinase C iota isozyme (PKC iota), a kinase downstream of Bcr-Abl. The mechanism(s) by which PKC iota mediates cell survival to taxol is unknown. Here we demonstrate that PKC iota requires the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) to confer cell survival. At apoptosis-inducing concentrations, taxol weakly induces IkappaB(alpha) proteolysis and NF-kappaB translocation in K562 cells, but potently induces its transcriptional activity. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity (by blocking IkappaB(alpha) degradation) significantly sensitizes cells to taxol-induced apoptosis. Likewise, K562 cells expressing antisense PKC iota mRNA or kinase dead PKC iota (PKC iota-KD) are sensitized to taxol; these cells are rescued from apoptosis by NF-kappaB overexpression. Expression of constitutively active PKC iota (PKC iota-CA) upregulates NF-kappaB transactivation and rescues cells from apoptosis in the absence of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity. Using a chimeric GAL4-RelA transactivator, we find that taxol potently activates GAL4-RelA-dependent transcription. This activation was further upregulated by expression of PKC iota-CA and inhibited by expression of PKC iota-KD. Our results indicate that RelA transactivation is an important downstream target of the PKC iota-mediated Bcr-Abl signaling pathway and is required for resistance to taxol-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2319257648,"Bcl-2 family proteins play a critical role in the regulation of cell survival by controlling the activation of the cell death executing caspase machinery. Recent work demonstrated that they also provide a link between growth factor signaling and cell survival control. Raf-1 has been identified initially as an essential component of the mitogenic Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade. However, expression of oncogenic Raf-1 also efficiently suppresses apoptotic cell death. This process requires mitochondrial translocation of Raf-1 which can be achieved either by co-expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 or by fusion with the transmembrane domain of the yeast outer mitochondrial membrane protein Mas 70p. It is currently unclear how mitochondrial Raf-1 prevents apoptosis. One possible mechanism involves the phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad resulting in the restoration of Bcl-2 function. Alternatively, the role of Bcl-2 could be limited to the mitochondrial translocation of Raf-1 and survival signaling by Raf-1 is Bcl-2 independent. To test for the mutual requirement of Raf-1 and Bcl-2 in apoptosis suppression the individual proteins were singly tested for survival activity in a genetic background which precludes the expression of the other. The results obtained in these studies demonstrate that ablation of Raf-1 or Bcl-2 expression in fibroblast cells significantly increases the sensitivity towards doxorubicin induced cell death. Reversion of the mutant phenotype could be achieved in either case by introducing a functional bcl-2 gene or a mitochondria targeted version of oncogenic Raf-1, demonstrating that each protein by itself is sufficient to confer protection. Our data thus suggest the existence of two separate pathways of survival signaling at the mitochondria controlled either by Bcl-2 or by Raf-1."

https://openalex.org/W2318192663,"Human glioma cell lines differ in their requirement for the inhibition of protein synthesis to activate the CD95-dependent killing pathway. CD95 ligand (CD95L) induced mitochondrial cytochrome c release and processing of caspases 3, 7, 8 and 9 in LN-18 cells in the absence of an inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide (CHX). These biochemical changes were observed in LN-229 cells only in the presence of CHX. The viral caspase inhibitor, cytokine response modifier (crm)-A, inhibited mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase processing and cell death under all conditions. Ectopic expression of BCL-X(L) prevented processing of caspase 8 in LN-18 cells but not in LN-229 cells. Thus, caspase 8 activation is amplified through the release of cytochrome c in LN-18 cells but occurs mainly at the receptor in LN-229 cells. In contrast to BCL-2, BCL-X(L), X-linked inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein (XIAP) and FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP), the levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p21Waf/Cip1, rapidly decreased in response to CHX. P21 antisense oligonucleotides promoted caspase activation and mitochondrial cytochrome c release and induced strong sensitization to CD95-mediated apoptosis. These data place potentiating effects of CHX (i) to the activation of caspase 8 at the receptor in LN-229 cells as well as (ii) to a down-stream target at least in LN-18 cells, but probably both cell lines, that may be identical with p21Waf/Cip1."
https://openalex.org/W2020382736,"We have identified three groups of deep earthquakes showing nearly identical waveforms in the Tonga slab. Relocation with a cross-correlation method shows that each cluster is composed of 10 to 30 earthquakes along a plane 10 to 30 kilometers in length. Some of the earthquakes are colocated, demonstrating repeated rupture of the same fault, and one pair of events shows identical rupture complexity, suggesting that the temporal and spatial rupture pattern was repeated. Recurrence intervals show an inverse time distribution, indicating a strong temporal control over fault reactivation. Runaway thermal shear instabilities may explain temporally clustered earthquakes with similar waveforms located along slip zones weakened by shear heating. Earthquake doublets that occur within a few hours are consistent with events recurring before the thermal energy of the initial rupture can diffuse away."
https://openalex.org/W2068337574,"The tumor suppressor activity of the BRCA1 gene product is due, in part, to functional interactions with other tumor suppressors, including p53 and the retinoblastoma (RB) protein. RB binding sites on BRCA1 were identified in the C-terminal BRCT domain (Yarden and Brody, 1999) and in the N-terminus (aa 304-394) (Aprelikova et al., 1999). The N-terminal site contains a consensus RB binding motif, LXCXE (aa 358-362), but the role of this motif in RB binding and BRCA1 functional activity is unclear. In both in vitro and in vivo assays, we found that the BRCA1:RB interaction does not require the BRCA1 LXCXE motif, nor does it require an intact A/B binding pocket of RB. In addition, nuclear co-localization of the endogenous BRCA1 and RB proteins was observed. Over-expression of wild-type BRCA1 (wtBRCA1) did not cause cell cycle arrest but did cause down-regulation of expression of RB, p107, p130, and other proteins (e.g., p300), associated with increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. In contrast, expression of a full-length BRCA1 with an LXCXE inactivating mutation (LXCXE-->RXRXH) failed to down-regulate RB, blocked the down-regulation of RB by wtBRCA1, induced chemoresistance, and abrogated the ability of BRCA1 to mediate tumor growth suppression of DU-145 prostate cancer cells. wtBRCA1-induced chemosensitivity was partially reversed by expression of either Rb or p300 and fully reversed by co-expression of Rb plus p300. Our findings suggest that: (1) disruption of the LXCXE motif within the N-terminal RB binding region alters the biologic function of BRCA1; and (2) over-expression of BRCA1 inhibits the expression of RB and RB family (p107 and p130) proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2052222677,"We have previously shown that the adenoviral 12S E1A protein modulates the phosphorylation status of p130 and p107 without apparent changes in the cell cycle dependent phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. Here we report on the mechanisms by which E1A modifies differentially the phosphorylation status of pocket proteins. In human U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells transiently expressing E1A, ectopic expression of D-type cyclins alone or combined, but not cyclins E and/or A, fully rescues E1A-mediated block in hyperphosphorylation of p130 to form 3. However, cyclins E and A, individually or together, induce hyperphosphorylation of p130 to species with intermediate mobility. Phosphopeptide maps indicate that E1A inhibits phosphorylation of sites phosphorylatable by CDKs. One of these sites is Ser-1044. The effects of blocking the activities of endogenous and exogenous cyclins with p16 and dominant negative CDK2 in E1A expressing cells further indicate that p130 is phosphorylated by both D-type cyclin and cyclin E/CDK complexes and that E1A modulates the activity of these G1/S CDKs by independent mechanisms. Stable expression of E1A in MC3T3-E1 cells leads to downregulation of D-type cyclins, and upregulation of cyclins E and A. This is accompanied by increased CDK2 kinase activity. Downregulation of D-type cyclins in these cells correlates with a block on both p130 hyperphosphorylation to form 3 and hyperphosphorylation of p107. This is rescued by D-type cyclins but not by cyclin E. In addition, we show that the upregulation of cyclins E and A is at least partially dependent on an intact pocket protein/E2F pathway, but downregulation of D-type cyclins is not. Moreover, we provide evidence that while the lack of a functional pRB pathway also results in a block on hyperphosphorylation of p130 to form 3, this is not sufficient to induce constitutive expression of p130 form 2b."
