https://openalex.org/W2551927833,"Spin–orbit coupling (SOC) describes the relativistic interaction between the spin and momentum degrees of freedom of electrons, and is central to the rich phenomena observed in condensed matter systems. In recent years, new phases of matter have emerged from the interplay between SOC and low dimensionality, such as chiral spin textures and spin-polarized surface and interface states. These low-dimensional SOC-based realizations are typically robust and can be exploited at room temperature. Here we discuss SOC as a means of producing such fundamentally new physical phenomena in thin films and heterostructures. We put into context the technological promise of these material classes for developing spin-based device applications at room temperature. The interplay between spin–orbit coupling and two-dimensionality has led to the emergence of new phases of matter, such as spin-polarized surface states in topological insulators, interfacial chiral spin interactions, and magnetic skyrmions in thin films, with great potential for spin-based devices. Substantial progress in the past decade in the fabrication and modelling of atomically precise interfaces and surfaces has led to the discovery of many electronic effects that are of interest for practical devices with novel functionalities. Christos Panagopoulos and colleagues review various such effects—and their technological potential—with a focus on the role of spin–orbit coupling, the fundamental interaction between the spin and charge degrees of freedom of an electron. Spin–orbit coupling can affect the electronic properties of materials at reduced dimensions, and the authors discuss the basic principles for understanding and engineering interfaces and surfaces in which spin–orbit coupling is harnessed. Examples are structures based on topological insulators where spin currents are generated or converted and magnetic layers where spin–orbit coupling leads to spin textures that can be controlled."

This “reprogramming” process has sparked interest because conceivably it could be harnessed as a therapeutic strategy for tissue regeneration. Mosteiro et al. used a mouse model to study the signals that promote cell reprogramming in vivo. They found that the factors that trigger reprogramming in vitro do the same in vivo; however, they also inflict cell damage. The damaged cells enter a state of senescence and begin secreting certain factors that promote reprogramming, including an inflammatory cytokine called interleukin-6. Thus, in the physiological setting, cell senescence may create a tissue context that favors reprogramming of neighboring cells. Science , this issue p. 10.1126/science.aaf4445"

https://openalex.org/W2551837899,"High humidity has a strong influence on the development of numerous diseases affecting the above-ground parts of plants (the phyllosphere) in crop fields and natural ecosystems, but the molecular basis of this humidity effect is not understood. Previous studies have emphasized immune suppression as a key step in bacterial pathogenesis. Here we show that humidity-dependent, pathogen-driven establishment of an aqueous intercellular space (apoplast) is another important step in bacterial infection of the phyllosphere. Bacterial effectors, such as Pseudomonas syringae HopM1, induce establishment of the aqueous apoplast and are sufficient to transform non-pathogenic P. syringae strains into virulent pathogens in immunodeficient Arabidopsis thaliana under high humidity. Arabidopsis quadruple mutants simultaneously defective in a host target (AtMIN7) of HopM1 and in pattern-triggered immunity could not only be used to reconstitute the basic features of bacterial infection, but also exhibited humidity-dependent dyshomeostasis of the endophytic commensal bacterial community in the phyllosphere. These results highlight a new conceptual framework for understanding diverse phyllosphere-bacterial interactions."

Yamada et al. now show how the fight for sugar plays out in the extracellular spaces around plant cells when pathogenic bacteria are invading the plant (see the Perspective by Dodds and Lagudah). In the model plant Arabidopsis , part of the defense response incited by the presence of pathogenic bacteria includes transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of sugar transporters. The resulting uptake of monosaccharides from the extracellular space makes life a little bit more difficult for the invading bacteria. Science , this issue p. 1427 ; see also p. 1377"

However, the scarcity of specimens hampers detailed mapping of tissue architecture. Furthermore, inaccuracies in the description of human development have crept into textbooks from observations of animal models that are extrapolated to humans. By mapping normal developmental processes and patterns, such as the growth and relative placement of organs, congenital anomalies can be better understood. de Bakker et al. generated interactive three-dimensional digital reconstructions based on the Carnegie collection of histologically sectioned human embryos spanning the first 2 months of gestation.

https://openalex.org/W2555392883,"Understanding the conditions that allow speciation to occur is difficult because most research has focused on either long-lived organisms or asexual microorganisms. We propagated bacteriophage λ, a virus with rapid generations and frequent recombination, on two Escherichia coli host genotypes that expressed either the LamB or OmpF receptor. When supplied with either single host (allopatry), phage λ improved its binding to the available receptor while losing its ability to use the alternative. When evolving on both hosts together (sympatry), the viruses split into two lineages with divergent receptor preferences. Although the level of divergence varied among replicates, some lineages evolved reproductive isolation via genetic incompatibilities. This outcome indicates that, under suitable conditions, allopatric and sympatric speciation can occur with similar ease."
https://openalex.org/W2555026798,"Intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) lack a well defined three-dimensional structure but often facilitate key protein functions. Some interactions between IDRs and folded protein domains rely on short linear motifs (SLiMs). These motifs are challenging to identify, but once found they can point to larger networks of interactions, such as with proteins that serve as hubs for essential cellular functions. The stress-associated plant protein radical-induced cell death1 (RCD1) is one such hub, interacting with many transcription factors via their flexible IDRs. To identify the SLiM bound by RCD1, we analyzed the IDRs in three protein partners, DREB2A (dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 2A), ANAC013, and ANAC046, considering parameters such as disorder, context, charges, and pI. Using a combined bioinformatics and experimental approach, we have identified the bipartite RCD1-binding SLiM as (DE)X(1,2)(YF)X(1,4)(DE)L, with essential contributions from conserved aromatic, acidic, and leucine residues. Detailed thermodynamic analysis revealed both favorable and unfavorable contributions from the IDRs surrounding the SLiM to the interactions with RCD1, and the SLiM affinities ranged from low nanomolar to 50 times higher Kd values. Specifically, although the SLiM was surrounded by IDRs, individual intrinsic α-helix propensities varied as shown by CD spectroscopy. NMR spectroscopy further demonstrated that DREB2A underwent coupled folding and binding with α-helix formation upon interaction with RCD1, whereas peptides from ANAC013 and ANAC046 formed different structures or were fuzzy in the complexes. These findings allow us to present a model of the stress-associated RCD1-transcription factor interactome and to contribute to the emerging understanding of the interactions between folded hubs and their intrinsically disordered partners.

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms are not completely understood. We aim to explore the functions and mechanisms of macrophage MR in atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis-susceptible LDLRKO chimeric mice with bone marrow cells from floxed control mice or from myeloid MR knock-out (MRKO) mice were generated and fed with high cholesterol diet. Oil red O staining showed that MRKO decreased atherosclerotic lesion area in LDLRKO mice. In another mouse model of atherosclerosis, MRKO/APOEKO mice and floxed control/APOEKO mice were generated and treated with angiotensin II. Similarly, MRKO inhibited the atherosclerotic lesion area in APOEKO mice. Histological analysis showed that MRKO increased collagen coverage and decreased necrosis and macrophage accumulation in the lesions. In vitro results demonstrated that MRKO suppressed macrophage foam cell formation and up-regulated the expression of genes involved in cholesterol efflux. Furthermore, MRKO decreased accumulation of apoptotic cells and increased effective efferocytosis in atherosclerotic lesions. In vitro study further revealed that MRKO increased the phagocytic index of macrophages without affecting their apoptosis. In conclusion, MRKO reduces high cholesterol- or angiotensin II-induced atherosclerosis and favorably changes plaque composition, likely improving plaque stability.

Atherosclerosis is the underlying basis of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, which together account for nearly 80% of all deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases (1Mendis S. Puska P. Norrving B. Global Atlas on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Control. 2011; (World Health Organization, World Heart Federation and World Stroke Organization)Google Scholar). Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases remain to be a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, posing a great threat to public health (2Libby P. Bornfeldt K.E. Tall A.R. Atherosclerosis: successes, surprises, and future challenges.Circ. Res. 2016; 118: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). New strategies and new targets are in need to treat atherosclerosis more effectively. Macrophages are the major immune cells in atherosclerotic plaques and play essential roles during the whole process of atherosclerosis in different aspects, including inflammation, foam cell formation, necrosis, and phagocytic clearance (3Tabas I. Bornfeldt K.E. Macrophage phenotype and function in different stages of atherosclerosis.Circ. Res. 2016; 118: 653-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 4Moore K.J. Tabas I. Macrophages in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.Cell. 2011; 145: 341-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar). In the early stages, macrophages accumulated in the subendothelial space ingest modified lipids to become foam cells that are a hallmark of atherosclerosis and the major component of early fatty streak lesions (5Moore K.J. Sheedy F.J. Fisher E.A. Macrophages in atherosclerosis: a dynamic balance.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). These macrophage-derived foam cells secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to amplify inflammatory response and to induce more accumulation of macrophages/foam cells, propelling expansion and progression of atherosclerotic plaques. In advanced lesions, apoptosis of macrophages/foam cells rapidly increases, whereas the ability of neighboring macrophages/foam cells to effectively clear the apoptotic cells (effective efferocytosis) decreases, both of which contribute to plaque necrosis and elevated inflammation. Therefore, targeting macrophages specifically has emerged as a promising novel strategy to combat atherosclerosis (3Tabas I. Bornfeldt K.E. Macrophage phenotype and function in different stages of atherosclerosis.Circ. Res. 2016; 118: 653-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Recent studies have illustrated that mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) 2The abbreviations used are: MRmineralocorticoid receptorFCfloxed controlMRKOmyeloid MR knock-outLDLRKOLDLR knock-outApoapolipoproteinAPOEKOApoE knock-outPPARγperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorγLXRliver X receptorABCG1ATP-binding cassette transporter G17KC7-ketocholesterolAngIIangiotensin IIBMDMbone marrow-derived macrophageqPCRquantitative PCRoxLDLoxidized low-density lipoprotein. is a critical control point of macrophage functions and may play pivotal roles in atherogenesis.

In the current study, we aim to study the function of macrophage MR in atherosclerosis and explore the mechanisms. We first use both low density lipoprotein receptor knock-out (LDLRKO) mice and apolipoprotein E knock-out (APOEKO) mice as the atherogenic mouse models, in combination with MRKO mice, to investigate whether macrophage MR affects atherogenesis. Then we further explore the possible mechanisms by analyzing the impacts of MR deficiency on foam cell formation and effective efferocytosis. To study whether myeloid MR deficiency contributes to atherogenesis, we performed bone marrow transplantation to generate atherosclerosis-susceptible LDLRKO chimeric mice with FC (FC → LDLRKO) or MRKO bone marrow cells (MRKO → LDLRKO). Four weeks after bone marrow transplantation, the chimeric percentage was more than 90% (Fig. 1). After feeding with a Western diet (high cholesterol) for 16 weeks, development of atherosclerosis was analyzed. Oil red O staining of the entire aorta demonstrated that the area of atherosclerotic lesions was significantly decreased in MRKO → LDLRKO mice compared with FC → LDLRKO mice (47.1% decrease; Fig. 2, A and B). Similarly, oil red O staining of cross-sections of aortic sinus revealed significantly smaller lesion areas in the aortic sinus in MRKO → LDLRKO mice (Fig. 2, C and D). Most metabolic parameters were undistinguishable between the two groups, except that triglycerides, apolipoprotein (Apo)B and ApoE were decreased in MRKO → LDLRKO mice (Fig. 3).FIGURE 2Myeloid MR deficiency suppresses atherosclerosis in LDLRKO mice.

MRKO/APOEKO (double knock-out) mice and FC/APOEKO mice were generated and treated with AngII or saline (control). MRKO/APOEKO mice showed a significant decrease (35%) in atherosclerotic lesions when treated with saline (Fig. 4, A and B). MRKO/APOEKO mice also showed a significant decrease (47.7%) in atherosclerotic lesions with AngII by en face staining of the aorta (Fig. 4, C and D). Oil red O staining of cross-sections of aortic sinus also showed significantly smaller lesion areas in the aortic sinus in MRKO/APOEKO mice with AngII (Fig. 4, E and F). MRKO did not affect the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm in this model (Fig. 4, G–I). Metabolic parameters were comparable between MRKO/APOEKO mice and FC/APOEKO mice (Fig. 5). Thus, myeloid MR deficiency suppresses AngII-induced atherosclerosis in atherogenic mice without changing the metabolic parameters, indicating direct influence of MRKO myeloid cells, particularly macrophages.FIGURE 5Effects of myeloid MR deficiency on metabolic parameters of APOEKO mice.

Collagen accumulation, necrosis, and inflammation are important features that could affect atherosclerotic plaque stability. Interestingly, picrosirius red staining demonstrated that myeloid MR deficiency significantly increased the ratio of plaque collagen coverage to total lesion area at the aortic sinus level (66.1% increase; Fig. 6, A and B). Further, hematoxylin and eosin staining of the aortic sinus showed that myeloid MR deficiency decreased necrotic area (57.0% reduction; Fig. 6, C and D). At cellular level, the amounts of macrophages in plaques closely correlate with atherosclerotic lesion formation and plaque stability (18Kojima Y. Downing K. Kundu R. Miller C. Dewey F. Lancero H. Raaz U. Perisic L. Hedin U. Schadt E. Maegdefessel L. Quertermous T. Leeper N.J. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B regulates efferocytosis and atherosclerosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124: 1083-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining of macrophages (mac2) showed that macrophage accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions was significantly decreased in MRKO → LDLRKO mice compared with FC → LDLRKO mice (49.1% reduction; Fig. 6, E and F). Negative control (replacing mac2 antibody with IgG) did not have any positive staining for macrophages (Fig. 6G). Together, these changes in MRKO → LDLRKO mice suggest that myeloid MR deficiency may improve the stability of atherosclerotic plaques. Accumulation of macrophages in lesions and subsequent foam cell formation by cholesterol accumulation is a critical early step in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis(4Moore K.J. Tabas I. Macrophages in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.Cell. 2011; 145: 341-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar). We tested whether myeloid MR deficiency affected foam cell formation. First, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were obtained from FC → LDLRKO mice and MRKO → LDLRKO mice after feeding with a Western diet. Oil red O staining revealed that foam cell formation markedly decreased in BMDMs of MRKO → LDLRKO mice compared with those of FC → LDLRKO mice (Fig. 7, A and B). Then we examined the impact of myeloid MR deficiency on expression of genes involved in cholesterol balance in these cells. Using qPCR, we assessed mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), liver X receptor-α (LXRα), LXRβ, retinoid X receptor α, ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily A1 (ABCA1), and ABCG1. The results showed that myeloid MR deficiency up-regulated gene expression of PPARγ, LXRα, retinoid X receptor α, and ABCG1 (Fig. 7C). Expression of genes such as scavenger receptor A, scavenger receptor BI, CD36, CD68, and lectin-like oxLDL receptor-1, was not significantly altered by MRKO, indicating that uptake of oxLDL was not affected (Fig. 7C). As expected, gene expression of MR was markedly suppressed in BMDMs from mice transplanted with MRKO bone marrow (Fig. 7C). Second, after incubation with oxLDL, peritoneal macrophages from MRKO/APOEKO mice developed much less foam cells than those from FC/APOEKO mice (Fig. 7, D and E). qPCR results showed that myeloid MR deficiency up-regulated gene expression of PPARγ, LXRα, and ABCG1 in these cells (Fig. 7F). Similarly, expression of genes related to uptake of oxLDL was not affected by MRKO (Fig. 7F). Third, flow cytometric analysis showed that peritoneal macrophages from MRKO/APOEKO mice engulfed less DiI-oxLDL than those from FC/APOEKO mice (Fig. 7, G and H). Fourth, foam cell formation decreased in peritoneal macrophages of MRKO mice compared with those of FC mice in vitro (Fig. 7, I and J). In addition, our results showed that MR deficiency did not influence oxidative status of macrophages (Fig. 8).FIGURE 8Myeloid MR deficiency does not affect oxidative status of macrophages.

We investigated whether myeloid MR deficiency affected macrophages efferocytosis (efficiency of phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells). To test efferocytosis in vivo, we first detected apoptotic cells in the atherosclerotic plaques of FC → LDLRKO mice and MRKO → LDLRKO mice by the TUNEL staining. We found that myeloid MR deficiency significantly decreased the number of apoptotic cells in lesions (Fig. 9, A and B), indicating the possibility of increased effective efferocytosis. Indeed, the atherosclerotic plaques of MRKO → LDLRKO mice had a higher efferocytosis index (the ratio of macrophage-associated to free apoptotic cells) than those of FC → LDLRKO mice (Fig. 9, A and C). Therefore, myeloid MR deficiency increased macrophage efferocytosis in the atherosclerotic lesions. Macrophages from FC and MRKO mice were used to further test the impacts of MR deficiency on the phagocytic ability of macrophages. Staining of F4/80 and calcein AM almost completely merged, suggesting that most viable cells were phagocytic macrophages (Fig. 9D). Further merge with staining of annexin V demonstrated that macrophages (as phagocytes) from MRKO mice phagocytized much more apoptotic cells than those from FC mice (Fig. 9D) and that both BMDMs and peritoneal macrophages from MRKO mice had higher phagocytic index (Fig. 9, E and F). MR deficiency did not affect apoptosis of macrophages (Fig. 9, G and H), further supporting the possibility that the observed decrease of apoptotic cells in atherosclerotic lesions was most likely attributable to increased effective efferocytosis. Although it has been demonstrated that antagonists of MR suppress atherosclerosis in different animal models (19Raz-Pasteur A. Gamliel-Lazarovich A. Gantman A. Coleman R. Keidar S.

MRKO increased collagen content but decreased necrosis and macrophage content in the plaques. Mechanistically, MRKO mitigated foam cell formation and up-regulated effective efferocytosis. Our data suggested that targeting macrophage MR specifically might be a feasible strategy to treat atherosclerosis. Our results revealed that MR blockade in macrophages was sufficient to mitigate atherosclerosis and likely improve plaque vulnerability, indicating that macrophage MR plays essential roles in the process of atherogenesis. It is plausible to treat atherosclerosis by selectively blockade of MR in macrophages using nanoparticles, which have been proved to be effective as delivery vehicles in the setting of atherosclerosis (3Tabas I.

This strategy allows local delivery of agents to block macrophage MR in atherosclerotic lesions, likely improving efficacy and circumventing systemic side effects. Our results indicated that macrophage MR deficiency improved stability of atherosclerotic plaques. First, MRKO increased collagen coverage of atherosclerotic plaques. The amount of collagen is a major determinant for the thickness of fibrous cap that significantly affects plaque stability (27Finn A.V. Nakano M. Narula J. Kolodgie F.D. Virmani R. Concept of vulnerable/unstable plaque.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30: 1282-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Second, MRKO improved effective efferocytosis and decreased macrophage accumulation and necrosis in atherosclerotic plaques. Apoptosis of macrophages and defective efferocytosis led to necrosis (4Moore K.J. Tabas I. Macrophages in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.Cell. 2011; 145: 341-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar), another risk factor for plaque instability (27Finn A.V.

Our results suggested that MRKO mainly improved efferocytosis that might lead to suppressed macrophage accumulation and necrosis. Macrophage MR deficiency inhibited foam cell formation likely by up-regulating expression of genes related to cholesterol efflux. Although it had been shown that antagonists of MR suppress the abilities of macrophages to oxidize LDL and uptake oxLDL (21Keidar S. Hayek T. Kaplan M. Pavlotzky E. Hamoud S. Coleman R. Aviram M.

Our results demonstrated that MR deficiency in macrophages inhibited foam cell formation, illustrating a direct role for macrophage MR. Macrophage reverse cholesterol transport plays central roles in the process of foam cell formation. MRKO increased expression of genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport. PPARγ and LXRα are among the most critical regulators of macrophage reverse cholesterol transport. The importance of both LXRα-ABCA1 and PPARγ-ABCG1 axis has been established in promoting cholesterol efflux and suppressing macrophage foam cell formation (29Li A.C. Binder C.J. Gutierrez A.

Impaired hepatic cholesterol homeostasis causes intracellular free cholesterol accumulation and hepatocyte injury. Sortilin 1 (SORT1) is a lysosomal trafficking receptor that was identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as a novel regulator of cholesterol metabolism in humans. Here we report that SORT1 deficiency protected against cholesterol accumulation-induced liver injury and inflammation in mice. Using an LC-MS/MS-based proteomics approach, we identified liver carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) as a novel SORT1-interacting protein. Mechanistic studies further showed that SORT1 may regulate CES1 lysosomal targeting and degradation and that SORT1 deficiency resulted in higher liver CES1 protein abundance. Previous studies have established an important role of hepatic CES1 in promoting intracellular cholesterol mobilization, cholesterol efflux, and bile acid synthesis. Consistently, high cholesterol atherogenic diet-challenged Sort1 knock-out mice showed less hepatic free cholesterol accumulation, increased bile acid synthesis, decreased biliary cholesterol secretion, and the absence of gallstone formation. SORT1 deficiency did not alter hepatic ceramide and fatty acid metabolism in high cholesterol atherogenic diet-fed mice. Finally, knockdown of liver CES1 in mice markedly increased the susceptibility to high cholesterol diet-induced liver injury and abolished the protective effect against cholesterol lipotoxicity in Sort1 knock-out mice. In summary, this study identified a novel SORT1-CES1 axis that regulates cholesterol-induced liver injury, which provides novel insights that improve our current understanding of the molecular links between SORT1 and cholesterol metabolism.

Its expression has been shown to be dependent on SOX9, a master transcription factor required for chondrogenesis that binds to an enhancer region in intron 1. However, ChIP sequencing revealed that SOX9 does not strongly bind to intron 1, but rather it binds to intron 6 and a site 30 kb upstream of the transcription start site. Here, we aimed to determine the role of the novel SOX9-binding site in intron 6. We prepared reporter constructs that contain a Col2a1 promoter, intron 1 with or without intron 6, and the luciferase gene. Although the reporter constructs were not activated by SOX9 alone, the construct that contained both introns 1 and 6 was activated 5–10-fold by the SOX9/SOX5 or the SOX9/SOX6 combination in transient-transfection assays in 293T cells. This enhancement was also observed in rat chondrosarcoma cells that stably expressed the construct. CRISPR/Cas9-induced deletion of intron 6 in RCS cells revealed that a 10-bp region of intron 6 is necessary both for Col2a1 expression and SOX9 binding. Furthermore, SOX9, but not SOX5, binds to this region as demonstrated in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, although both SOX9 and SOX5 bind to a larger 325-bp fragment of intron 6 containing this small sequence. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of action of SOX5/6; namely, the SOX9/5/6 combination enhances Col2a1 transcription through a novel enhancer in intron 6 together with the enhancer in intron 1."

The intestinal enterocyte is a key regulatory point for copper absorption into the body; however, the mechanisms by which intestinal cells transport copper to maintain organismal copper homeostasis are poorly understood.

Specifically, we show that CUA-1, the C. elegans homolog of ATP7A/B, localizes to lysosome-like organelles (gut granules) in the intestine under copper overload conditions for copper detoxification, whereas copper deficiency results in a redistribution of CUA-1 to basolateral membranes for copper efflux to peripheral tissues. Worms defective in gut granule biogenesis exhibit defects in copper sequestration and increased susceptibility to toxic copper levels.

The ability of class A scavenger receptors (SR-As) to bind anionic ligands facilitates the internalization of negatively charged cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)-nucleic acid nanocomplexes and thus makes them attractive targets for delivery of various nucleic acids. Recently, we demonstrated that SR-A3 and SR-A5 are recruited from intracellular membranes to the plasma membrane after incubation with PepFect 14-splice-switching oligonucleotide complexes. Here, we examined the mechanisms responsible for translocation of SR-As to the cell surface. We demonstrate that, in addition to nanocomplexes, some amphipathic CPPs are able to induce externalization of SR-A3 and SR-A5, and this process requires the presence of calcium ions. Furthermore, translocation of SR-A3 and SR-A5 requires activity of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, intact actin cytoskeleton, and the presence of serum proteins in culture medium.-Juks, C., Lorents, A., Arukuusk, P., Langel, Ü., Pooga, M.

Gene and protein expression of UBE2v1, a ubiquitin-conjugating E2-enzyme variant that mediates Lys63-linked ubiquitination, and Lys63-ubiquitinated proteins increased in HK2 tubular cells under HG. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/tandem mass spectrometry identified 30 Lys63-ubiquitinated proteins, mainly involved in cellular organization, such as β-actin, whose Lys63 ubiquitination increased under HG, leading to cytoskeleton disorganization. This effect was reversed by the inhibitor of the Ubc13/UBE2v1 complex NSC697923. Western blot analysis confirmed that UBE2v1 silencing in HK2 under HG, restored Lys63-β-actin ubiquitination levels to the basal condition. Immunohistochemistry on patients with type 2 diabetic (T2D) revealed an increase in UBE2v1- and Lys63-ubiquitinated proteins, particularly in kidneys of patients with DN compared with control kidneys and other nondiabetic renal diseases, such as membranous nephropathy. Increased Lys63 ubiquitination both in vivo in patients with DN and in vitro, correlated with α-SMA expression, whereas UBE2v1 silencing reduced HG-induced α-SMA protein levels, returning them to basal expression. In conclusion, UBE2v1- and Lys63-ubiquitinated proteins increase in vitro under HG, as well as in vivo in T2D, is augmented in patients with DN, and may affect cytoskeleton organization and influence epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

Activation of actin filament assembly requires release of the VCA domain for it to bind G-actin and recruit the Arp2/3 complex (14Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J.

Binding of IcsA to N-WASP has been shown to enhance the affinity of the VCA domain for the Arp2/3 complex and of the N-terminal region (residues 1–276) for F-actin (14Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V.

However, an N-WASP mutant H208D that is incapable of binding to Cdc42 is still recruited to the Shigella surface and can induce actin tail formation (18Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T.

The molecular mechanism of N-WASP activation by IcsA remains poorly understood because regions other than the GBD have been implicated in binding to IcsA. Using N-WASP/WASP chimeric proteins, Suzuki et al. (15Suzuki T. Mimuro H. Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. Sasakawa C. Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) is the specific ligand for Shigella VirG among the WASP family and determines the host cell type allowing actin-based spreading.Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) identified that a region encompassing the N-terminal WASP-homology 1 (WH1) domain was sufficient for binding IcsA, whereas a chimeric protein incorporating N-WASP residues 159–275 (encompassing the GBD) was not capable of binding IcsA. In contrast, Lommel et al. (18Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kühn R. Actin pedestal formation by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and intracellular motility of Shigella flexneri are abolished in N-WASP-defective cells.EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) showed that constructs of N-WASP lacking the WH1 domain were recruited to the Shigella surface and capable of restoring actin tail formation although with lower efficiency and/or shorter tails. This study also showed that constructs encoding only residues 156–274 of N-WASP were capable of being recruited to the Shigella surface. This was in agreement with a previous study that found that residues 148–273 of N-WASP are recruited to the bacterial pole during actin polymerization (21Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Vincentelli R. Rabut G. Stewart D. Way M. A complex of N-WASP and WIP integrates signalling cascades that lead to actin polymerization.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Shigella is still capable of inducing actin tail formation in cells expressing N-WASP missing residues 160–225, suggesting that residues 226–274 may represent a minimal recruitment domain (18Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kühn R. Actin pedestal formation by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and intracellular motility of Shigella flexneri are abolished in N-WASP-defective cells.EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, because residues 1–154 encompassing the WH1 domain are still capable of being recruited to the bacterial surface, there is likely to be an additional WH1 domain-mediated recruitment mechanism (18Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kühn R. Actin pedestal formation by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and intracellular motility of Shigella flexneri are abolished in N-WASP-defective cells.EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Early work also implicated the C-terminal VCA domain of N-WASP in IcsA binding (22Suzuki T. Sasakawa C.

Early work on domain mapping of IcsA showed that IcsA residues 53–508 are necessary for F-actin assembly (23Suzuki T. Saga S. Sasakawa C. Functional analysis of Shigella VirG domains essential for interaction with vinculin and actin-based motility.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21878-21885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and further work showed that IcsA residues 103–433 represented the minimal region required for N-WASP binding (22Suzuki T. Sasakawa C. N-WASP is an important protein for the actin-based motility of Shigella flexneri in the infected epithelial cells.Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1998; 51: S63-S68Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Another study confirmed the importance of IcsA residues 104–226 for N-WASP recruitment and residues 508–730 for F-actin assembly but not N-WASP interaction (24May K.L. Morona R. Mutagenesis of the Shigella flexneri autotransporter IcsA reveals novel functional regions involved in IcsA biogenesis and recruitment of host neural Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 4666-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here we show that the purified IcsA passenger domain is monomeric and possesses an elongated bent structure in solution. Pull-down experiments identify that the IcsA passenger domain can bind directly to both the WH1 and GBD regions of N-WASP but not the VCA domain. Binding studies show that IcsA competes with the VCA region for binding to the N-WASP GBD and that this interaction is significantly enhanced by IcsA also binding to the WH1 domain. Domain mapping of the IcsA interaction interface identifies distinct regions of IcsA that are responsible for binding to the WH1 and GBD domains, leaving the N-WASP VCA domain free to bind the Arp2/3 complex. Expression in Escherichia coli of full-length IcsA including the N-terminal secretion signal and the C-terminal transporter domain followed by immunoblotting reveals a protein of ∼120 kDa present in the cell pellet consistent with membrane-bound IcsA (Fig. 1B). Co-expression of full-length IcsA with the Shigella protease IcsP releases the 72-kDa passenger domain of IcsA (IcsA(53–758)) into the culture supernatant (Fig. 1B). To isolate large quantities of pure IcsA(53–758), a FLAG epitope tag was inserted into this IcsA construct between the secretion signal and the N terminus of the passenger domain (Fig. 1C). Isolating IcsA(53–758) with FLAG antibody resin resulted in high yields of pure protein (Fig. 2A). Purified IcsA(53–758) was folded as shown by thermal denaturation using differential scanning fluorimetry (Fig. 2B). IcsA(53–758) has a melting temperature of 57 °C in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and high throughput screening of a range of buffers, pH, and additives revealed only very minor increases in stability (e.g. the addition of 5% glycerol conferred a 1º C increase in the melting temperature). The addition of 300 mm imidazole was found to be destabilizing, resulting in a 6º C decrease in the melting temperature, whereas 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride unfolded IcsA, resulting in the absence of a thermal melt curve. Despite predictions that IcsA may bind calcium, the addition of 10 mm CaCl2 does not seem to affect the stabilization of IcsA. Using multiangle laser light scattering coupled to size exclusion chromatography (SEC-MALS), IcsA(53–758) was shown to be monomeric with an experimentally determined molecular mass of 73 kDa (Fig. 2C). The early volume at which IcsA elutes off of the size exclusion column (13.3 ml) suggests that the protein may adopt an elongated structure in solution (compared with BSA at 66 kDa, which elutes at 14.2 ml). This observation is consistent with structural predictions that IcsA will possess a β-helix fold similar to that of other autotransporters. Predictive/hierarchical 3D structural modeling generated by I-TASSER (25Yang J. Yan R. Roy A. Xu D. Poisson J. Zhang Y. The I-TASSER Suite: protein structure and function prediction.Nat.

The top three I-TASSER structural predictions each possess the characteristic β-helix fold with a V-shaped cross-section (Fig. 2D). Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was performed to obtain the primary structural parameters and overall shape characteristics of monomeric IcsA(53–758) in solution. In-line size exclusion chromatography SAXS (SEC-SAXS) was employed based on the results from SEC-MALS indicating the presence of trace higher molecular weight species in a typical IcsA(53–758) sample, thus ensuring that the scattering intensity data were measured from the separated monomeric form. In support of this, the radius of gyration (Rg) through the monomer elution peak is consistent (3.5–3.8 nm) and has no significant dependence on the forward scattering intensity at zero-angle. The final averaged SAXS profile of monomeric IcsA (53–758) is shown in Fig. 3A, and the Guinier plot of the SAXS data is linear (R2 = 0.98; Fig. 3A, inset), as expected for aggregate-free, monodisperse systems, yielding an Rg of 3.64 ± 0.02 nm. This Rg is somewhat large for a protein of its size (72 kDa) (e.g. when compared with globular monomeric (BSA; 66 kDa) that has an Rg of 2.8 nm), suggesting that IcsA(53–758) has a relatively non-globular anisotropic mass distribution. The corresponding p(r) versus r profile (Fig. 3B) supports this observation because the distribution of vector lengths is skewed, showing asymmetry for r > 3 nm that extends to a maximum particle dimension (Dmax) of ∼13 nm (BSA possesses a Dmax of ∼9 nm). The a priori shape classification of the SAXS data places IcsA(53–758) in the “flat/extended” regime; however, both the shoulder observed on the p(r) versus r profile between 6 < r < 9 nm and the associated shape-topology from automated analysis in terms of shapes (Fig. 3C (29Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I. Ambiguity assessment of small-angle scattering curves from monodisperse systems.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2015; 71: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)) indicate that the protein, although structurally anisotropic, is probably bent or modular. The combined results obtained from the initial analysis of the SAXS data suggest that the predicted β-helix fold of the protein does not adopt an overall rodlike conformation typical of most autotransporters. The final structural parameters extracted from the data, including volume and molecular mass estimates, are consistent with monomeric IcsA(53–758) and the SEC-MALS results (Table 1).TABLE 1Structural parameters for IcsA(53–758)Rg (Guinier)Rg (p(r) versus r)DmaxVp, Porod volumeVp, DAM volumeMMaMM, molecular mass.

Open table in a new tab Two approaches were used for ab initio shape analysis of IcsA(53–758): dummy atom modeling, where the shape is represented as a collection of dummy atoms (beads) using the program DAMMIN, and a dummy residue approach representing the protein structure by a chainlike ensemble of average residues using GASBOR (available on the EMBL Hamburg website). These models support the conclusions reached from the primary SAXS data analysis. The individual models representing the low resolution structure of IcsA(53–758) fit the SAXS data (χ2 = 1.9) with no systematic deviations observed, as assessed using Correlation Map (CorMap p = 0.84; Fig. 3 (D and E)) (30Svergun D.I.

Correlation Map, a goodness-of-fit test for one-dimensional X-ray scattering spectra.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Both the GASBOR and DAMMIN models show a characteristic ∼90° “bend” in the IcsA(53–758) monomer that occurs approximately halfway along the length of the protein so that the overall structure of the protein adopts an L-shaped conformation. When compared with the highest scoring I-TASSER model of IcsA(53–758), which otherwise has an almost identical Rg (3.7 nm) and Dmax (13 nm) as that determined from SAXS, the I-TASSER model does not fit the data (χ2 = 3.4; CorMap p = 0; Fig. 4A). The major difference between the predicted I-TASSER model and SAXS-based ab initio model is that the β-helix of the predicted structure is not discernably bent. Using an independent approach to support the conclusions reached from ab initio modeling, the highest scoring I-TASSER model underwent normal mode rigid body refinement directly against the SAXS data (SREFLEX (33Panjkovich A. Svergun D.I. Deciphering conformational transitions of proteins by small angle X-ray scattering and normal mode analysis.Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2016; 18: 5707-5719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). It is necessary for the β-helix of the I-TASSER model to undergo a bend to fit the SAXS profile, giving rise to the characteristic “hump” in the p(r) versus r profile centered around 7 nm (Fig. 4, A–E; final refined model χ2 = 2.1; CorMap p = 0.03). Bent, or L-shaped, β-helices are not unprecedented for autotransporters (e.g. a 110° “kink” is observed approximately midway along the length of the β-helix of the antigen 43 (Ag43a) autotransporter protein from E. coli) (Fig. 4F; PDB entry 4KH3) (34Heras B.

GST fusion constructs encompassing different domains of N-WASP were expressed and purified for binding studies with IcsA(53–758) (Fig. 5A).

Recently, we have characterized a Plasmodium vivax tryptophan-rich antigen PvTRAg38, which is expressed by its merozoites, binds to host erythrocytes, and interferes with parasite growth. Interaction of this parasite ligand with the host erythrocyte occurs through its two regions present at amino acid positions 167–178 (P2) and 197–208 (P4). Each region recognizes its own erythrocyte receptor. Previously, we identified band 3 as the chymotrypsin-sensitive erythrocyte receptor for the P4 region, but the other receptor, binding to P2 region, remained unknown. Here, we have identified basigin as the second erythrocyte receptor for PvTRAg38, which is resistant to chymotrypsin. The specificity of interaction between PvTRAg38 and basigin was confirmed by direct interaction where basigin was specifically recognized by P2 and not by the P4 region of this parasite ligand. Interaction between P2 and basigin is stabilized through multiple amino acid residues, but Gly-171 and Leu-175 of P2 were more critical. These two amino acids were also critical for parasite growth. Synthetic peptides P2 and P4 of PvTRAg38 interfered with the parasite growth independently but had an additive effect if combined together indicating involvement of both the receptors during red cell invasion.

Plasmodium vivax causes malaria in a huge human population in Southeast Asia and South America, thus affecting their socio-economic conditions.

For effective control of this disease, newer anti-malarial drugs and vaccines need to be developed. Thus, identification of drug and vaccine targets is urgently needed. In this regard, the parasite molecules expressed at the merozoite stage and involved in erythrocyte invasion hold their significance as they have been proven to be the most effective drug or vaccine targets (3Hostetler J.B. Sharma S. Bartholdson S.J. Wright G.J. Fairhurst R.M. Rayner J.C.

Dis. 2015; 9e0004264 Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Large numbers of host and parasite molecules need to interact with each other during erythrocyte invasion by the malarial parasite. Identification of all the host erythrocyte receptors and their respective parasite ligands involved in this process is incomplete. P. falciparum exploits lot of erythrocyte receptors, ranging from highly abundant band 3, which has the merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) complex (4Goel V.K. Li X. Chen H. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Oh S.S. band 3 is a host receptor binding merozoite surface protein 1 during the Plasmodium falciparum invasion of erythrocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Several other receptor-ligand interactions are also known for erythrocyte invasion, including the following: P. falciparum erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (PfEBA175) and glycophorin A (6Sim B.K.

Although several erythrocyte receptor molecules have been identified for the P. falciparum merozoite proteins, this number is unfortunately very limited in the case of P. vivax. The most commonly known receptor-ligand interaction in P. vivax is the Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines being recognized by the parasite ligand Duffy-binding protein 1 (DBP 1) expressed by the merozoite (10Miller L.H. Mason S.J. Clyde D.F. McGinniss M.H. The resistance factor to Plasmodium vivax in blacks. The Duffy-blood-group genotype, FyFy.N. Engl. J. Med. 1976; 295: 302-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Indications have appeared in the literature that there are other host-receptor molecules recognized by the P. vivax merozoite ligands during the red cell invasion, which may be independent of the Duffy antigen (11Ménard D. Barnadas C. Bouchier C. Henry-Halldin C. Gray L.R. Ratsimbasoa A. Thonier V. Carod J.F. Domarle O. Colin Y. Bertrand O. Picot J. King C.L. Grimberg B.T. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Zimmerman P.A.

Recently, DBP 1 has been shown to recognize a different receptor for invasion in Duffy null erythrocytes (12Gunalan K. Lo E. Hostetler J.B. Yewhalaw D. Mu J. Neafsey D.E. Yan G. Miller L.H.

Although several merozoite proteins of P. vivax, including reticulocyte-binding proteins, are identified, which interact with the erythrocytes during invasion process, their respective receptors have yet to be explored (13Chan E.R. Barnwell J.W. Zimmerman P.A. Serre D. Comparative analysis of field-isolate and monkey-adapted Plasmodium vivax genomes.PLoS Negl. Trop.

Recently, we have reported that several P. vivax tryptophan-rich antigens (PvTRAgs) belonging to the pv-fam-a family were highly immunogenic in humans, have conserved sequences in parasite population, and bind to host erythrocytes through two receptors (14Tyagi R.K.

Erythrocyte binding activity displayed by a selective group of Plasmodium vivax tryptophan rich antigens is inhibited by patients' antibodies.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7e50754 Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and promotes the parasite growth in the heterologous P. falciparum culture system (19Alam M.S. Choudhary V. Zeeshan M. Tyagi R.K. Rathore S. Sharma Y.D. Interaction of Plasmodium vivax tryptophan-rich antigen PvTRAg38 with band 3 on human erythrocyte surface facilitates parasite growth.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 20257-20272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have been able to define two erythrocyte-binding regions, P2 (at amino acid position 167–178) and P4 (at amino acid position 198–208), of this parasite ligand that interact with two different erythrocyte receptors. Among these two erythrocyte receptors, one was sensitive to chymotrypsin and interacts through the P4 region and the other receptor was resistant to this enzyme. The chymotrypsin-sensitive erythrocyte receptor for the P4 region has recently been identified as band 3 (19Alam M.S. Choudhary V. Zeeshan M. Tyagi R.K. Rathore S. Sharma Y.D. Interaction of Plasmodium vivax tryptophan-rich antigen PvTRAg38 with band 3 on human erythrocyte surface facilitates parasite growth.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 20257-20272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, multiple residues of the P4 region interact with three different ectodomains of band 3 (20Alam M.S. Rathore S. Tyagi R.K. Sharma Y.D. Host-parasite interaction: multiple sites in the Plasmodium vivax tryptophan-rich antigen PvTRAg38 interact with the erythrocyte receptor band 3.FEBS Lett. 2016; 590: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The second erythrocyte receptor that is resistant to chymotrypsin and is recognized by the P2 region of this parasite ligand remains unidentified. Results of this study indicate that this chymotrypsin-resistant erythrocyte receptor for PvTRAg38 recognized by its P2 region is basigin. Both P2 and P4 peptides interfere with parasite growth, signifying the involvement of both receptors, basigin and band 3, in red cell invasion. Previous studies have shown that the parasite ligand PvTRAg38 interacts with two erythrocyte receptors, where one of them was sensitive to chymotrypsin (14Tyagi R.K. Sharma Y.D. Erythrocyte binding activity displayed by a selective group of Plasmodium vivax tryptophan rich antigens is inhibited by patients' antibodies.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7e50754 Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the chymotrypsin-sensitive human erythrocyte receptor for this parasite protein was identified as band 3 (19Alam M.S. Choudhary V. Zeeshan M. Tyagi R.K. Rathore S. Sharma Y.D.

Therefore, in pursuit of identifying the second erythrocyte receptor for PvTRAg38, we used a more sensitive method of LC-MS/MS-based multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) 4The abbreviations used are: MudPITmultidimensional protein identification technologyBSGbasiginEMPerythrocyte membrane proteinONPGortho-nitrophenyl-glactopyranosideSPRsurface plasmon resonanceGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolHSVgDherpes simplex virus glycoprotein DTEABtriethylammonium bicarbonateY2Hyeast two-hybridAT3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. analysis (21Florens L.

Large-scale analysis of the yeast proteome by multidimensional protein identification technology.Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4077) Google Scholar). This technique identified seven proteins from the erythrocyte membrane extract, including previously identified band 3, as probable interacting partners of PvTRAg38 (Table 1). In a parallel set of experiments, we carried out Label transfer assay (23Liu B. Archer C.T. Burdine L. Gillette T.G. Kodadek T. Label transfer chemistry for the characterization of protein-protein interactions.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 12348-12349Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), using tri-functional cross-linker-tagged PvTRAg38 and erythrocyte membrane lysate (Fig. 1A). As the cross-linker, which had been used to tag the protein before pulldown, was labeled with biotin, streptavidin conjugated to HRP allowed us to detect interacting proteins to which the tag was specifically transferred (Fig. 1B). The corresponding bands, to which the label was transferred, were excised from the colloidal Coomassie Blue-stained gel and identified by mass spectrometric analysis. Except for glycophorin A and calcium-transporting ATPase, the other proteins were commonly identified by both the techniques (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Hence, we excluded these two erythrocyte proteins from further analysis. Furthermore, the 55-kDa erythrocyte membrane protein (EMP) and solute carrier family protein 1 (SCFP1), known to be highly abundant proteins on the erythrocyte surface and frequently found as contaminants in the pulldown assays, were also eliminated as probable interacting partners. Therefore, besides band 3, basigin or CD59 could be promising erythrocyte receptor candidates and were tested further. Presence of basigin in the eluates was confirmed by Western blotting analysis where a single band at the expected position of ∼28 kDa was observed with anti-basigin antibody (Fig. 1C).TABLE 1Identification of putative erythrocyte surface proteins interacting with PvTRAg38 by MudPIT analysisS. noProteins identified by in solution mass spectrometryMolecular massCoverageUnique peptideskDa%1Anion exchanger-1 (band 3)101.736232Basigin28398355-kDa erythrocyte membrane protein50.22274Solute carrier family protein glucose-facilitated transporter member 1541465Calcium-transporting ATPase1383646CD59 glycoprotein172437Glycophorin A30432 Open table in a new tab multidimensional protein identification technology basigin erythrocyte membrane protein ortho-nitrophenyl-glactopyranoside surface plasmon resonance glycosylphosphatidylinositol herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D triethylammonium bicarbonate yeast two-hybrid 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The above two techniques, MudPIT analysis and Label transfer assay, identified three probable erythrocyte-interacting partners of PvTRAg38. Among these three erythrocyte proteins, band 3 has already been confirmed as one of the erythrocyte receptors for this parasite ligand (19Alam M.S. Choudhary V. Zeeshan M. Tyagi R.K. Rathore S. Sharma Y.D. Interaction of Plasmodium vivax tryptophan-rich antigen PvTRAg38 with band 3 on human erythrocyte surface facilitates parasite growth.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 20257-20272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, we planned to study direct interaction between PvTRAg38 and each of the other two erythrocyte proteins. We also included 55-kDa EMP as a control for the abundant erythrocyte membrane proteins in this assay. Although CD59 and 55-kDa EMP were obtained commercially, histidine-tagged recombinant basigin was prepared in the laboratory (Fig. 2A) and checked for its proper secondary structure by circular dichroism (CD) studies. The CD spectra showed a dominantly β-pleated sheet for this recombinant basigin (Fig. 2B), which is similar to that of the reported structure of native human basigin (24Yu X.L. Hu T. Du J.M.

Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18056-18065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the gel permeation chromatography profile of this recombinant basigin indicates that the protein was in a monomeric form (Fig. 2C). Solid phase binding assay results showed a dose-dependent binding of PvTRAg38 to basigin and not with CD59 or 55-kDa EMP (Fig. 3A). These erythrocyte proteins did not show binding to the negative control bacterial thioredoxin (Fig. 3A, inset). The affinity of the basigin and PvTRAg38 interaction was ascertained by surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based studies. Using basigin as ligand, which was covalently coated to the activated surface of the CM5 chip following the amine coupling method, we flowed different concentrations of analyte, i.e. GST-tagged PvTRAg38. The kinetic analysis sensorgrams (Fig. 3B) show a concentration-dependent increase in the binding of ligand and analyte during the association phase. The binding affinity was found to be fairly significant with a calculated KD value of 3.0 ± 0.68 × 10−6 m. The Label transfer assay using recombinant basigin and labeled recombinant PvTRAg38 further confirmed the interaction between basigin and PvTRAg38 where the label, biotin tag, was transferred from PvTRAg38 to basigin (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3.Binding of PvTRAg38 to basigin. A, solid phase ELISA. Increasing concentrations (0–2.5 μm) of histidine-tagged basigin, 55-kDa EMP, or CD59 were added to the wells of an ELISA plate already coated with 50 nm GST-tagged PvTRAg38 or untagged thioredoxin (inset).

Specificity of binding between PvTRAg38 and basigin was also evident from the antibody inhibition assay where this interaction was inhibited by the specific antibody in a dilution-dependent manner (Fig. 3, E and F). The above-mentioned assays used the purified recombinant fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli. To investigate the binding of PvTRAg38 to the basigin that is expressed in its natural form by the eukaryotic cells, we used two different cell-based assays, e.g. the yeast-two hybrid system and mammalian HEK-293 cell transfections. For yeast two-hybrid assay, basigin has been cloned in bait vector (pGAD) in fusion with the activation domain of the GAL4p promoter, whereas PvTRAg38 was cloned in prey vector (pGBK7) in fusion with the binding domain of the GAL4p promoter. Co-transformed yeast cells (AH109) were able to grow well on various triple dropout media (SD/Leu−His−Trp−), whereas vector alone, pGAD-basigin, pGBK7-PvTRAg38, pGAD-basigin and pGBK7, and pGBK7-PvTRAg38 and pGAD were not showing any growth on the dropout media. These results point toward direct interaction between basigin and PvTRAg38 in this cell-based assay (Fig. 4A). Because PvTRAg38 and basigin interaction was positive on nutritional selection media (SD/Leu−His−Trp−), lacZ reporter gene expression was confirmed by assay using ortho-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (ONPG) as substrate. The AH109 strain of yeast co-transformed with PvTRAg38 and basigin yielded a moderate β-galactosidase activity, whereas the other transformants with combination of empty activation domain or binding domain vectors have low or negligible amounts of β-galactosidase activity as compared with the positive interactions (Fig. 4B). For the mammalian system, basigin was expressed on the HEK-293 cell surface, and the transfected cells were used for the interaction with GST-tagged PvTRAg38. The green fluorescence for basigin and red fluorescence for GST tag of PvTRAg38 were overlapping with each other (seen as yellow) across the cell surface (epithelium-like) surrounding the DAPI-stained nucleus (Fig. 5, upper panel). Cells transfected with pRE4 (vector alone) were not recognized by either of the two antibodies (Fig. 5, lower panel). This co-localization confirmed the interaction between basigin and PvTRAg38 (Fig. 5). PvTRAg38 interacts with erythrocytes through two peptide regions, P2 and P4 at amino acid positions 161–178 and 197–214, respectively (19Alam M.S. Choudhary V. Zeeshan M. Tyagi R.K. Rathore S.

Further studies revealed that last six amino acids of this P4 peptide were not involved in erythrocyte binding, but multiple residues of the remaining 12 amino acid peptides interact with its erythrocyte receptor (20Alam M.S.

As it is known that PvTRAg38 recognizes two erythrocyte receptors (14Tyagi R.K. Sharma Y.D.

We have used the truncated 12-amino acid-long P2 peptide (positioned at 167–178 of PvTRAg38) in this study because the first six amino acid residues at the 161–166-position of the original 18-amino acid-long peptide were not involved in erythrocyte binding (data not shown). Sequence and position of P2 and P4 peptides are shown in Fig. 6A. Results of the solid phase binding assay suggested that P2 binds to basigin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). Peptide P4, which recognizes band 3, did not show binding to the basigin (Fig. 6B, inset). Binding of P2 with basigin was also confirmed by SPR where the binding affinity was significant with a KD value of 1.02 ± 0.12 × 10−9 m (Fig. 6C). The specificity of binding of P2 to basigin was confirmed by the competitive inhibition assay where binding of PvTRAg38 to basigin was increasingly inhibited with increased concentrations of P2 (Fig. 6D).

However, because native G-calpain exhibits a highly restricted expression pattern, it has never been purified, and the interactions between CAPN8 and CAPN9 have not been characterized. Here, we clarified the molecular nature of G-calpain by using recombinant proteins and transgenic mice expressing FLAG-tagged CAPN8 (CAPN8-FLAG). Recombinant mouse CAPN8 and CAPN9 co-expressed in eukaryotic expression systems exhibited the same mobility as native mouse G-calpain in Blue Native-PAGE gels, and CAPN8-FLAG immunoprecipitation from stomach homogenates of the transgenic mice showed that CAPN9 was the only protein that associated with CAPN8-FLAG. These results indicated that G-calpain is a heterodimer of CAPN8 and CAPN9. In addition, active recombinant G-calpain was expressed and purified using an in vitro translation system, and the purified protease exhibited enzymatic properties that were comparable with that of calpain-2. We found that an active-site mutant of CAPN8, but not CAPN9, compromised G-calpain's substrate cleavage activity, and that the N-terminal helix region of CAPN8 and the C-terminal EF-hands of CAPN8 and CAPN9 were involved in CAPN8/9 dimerization. Furthermore, CAPN8 protein in Capn9−/− mice was almost completely lost, whereas CAPN9 was only partially lost in Capn8−/− mice.

Here, we investigated whether cytoplasmic PELP1 signaling promotes breast cancer initiation in models of immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). Global gene expression analysis was performed on HMEC lines expressing vector control, PELP1-wt, or mutant PELP1 in which the nuclear localization sequence was altered, resulting in cytoplasmic localization of PELP1 (PELP1-cyto). Global gene expression analysis identified that PELP1-cyto expression in HMECs induced NF-κB signaling pathways. Western blotting analysis of PELP1-cyto HMECs showed up-regulation of inhibitor of κB kinase ɛ (IKKɛ) and increased phosphorylation of the NF-κB subunit RelB. To determine whether secreted factors produced by PELP1-cyto HMECs promote macrophage activation, THP-1 macrophages were treated with HMEC-conditioned medium (CM). PELP1-cyto CM induced changes in THP-1 gene expression as compared with control cell CM. Double conditioned medium (DCM) from the activated THP-1 cells was then applied to HMECs to determine whether paracrine signaling from PELP1-cyto-activated macrophages could in turn promote migration of HMECs. PELP1-cyto DCM induced robust HMEC migration, which was reduced in DCM from PELP1-cyto HMECs expressing IKKɛ shRNA. Our findings suggest that cytoplasmic localization of PELP1 up-regulates pro-tumorigenic IKKɛ and secreted inflammatory signals, which through paracrine macrophage activation regulates the migratory phenotype associated with breast cancer initiation.

Neuron. 2016; 92 (this issue): 773-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar demonstrate that it is the preparation, not execution, of different follow-through movements that separates motor memories and reduces interference. Suppose you are a daring mountain biker practicing to jump off a ramp. You’ve spent months perfecting your technique, learning to build up speed, to navigate the ramp, and to gracefully negotiate the landing. Now, you feel confident enough to attempt a new trick, a backflip performed mid-air. To give yourself sufficient time aloft for the maneuver, you’ll need a steeper ramp to launch you higher into the air (Figure 1A). You could modify your existing ramp for the new trick. Alternatively, you might construct a second, steeper ramp elsewhere and follow a distinct downhill path to this new ramp from a different starting point. Building a second ramp has the advantage that any adjustments made to the second ramp won’t interfere with your performance of the basic jump off the original ramp, sans mid-air acrobatics. In this issue of Neuron, Sheahan and colleagues demonstrate that the motor system may employ an analogous strategy, wherein distinct motor plans engaged during movement preparation (starting points) can be independently modified by motor learning (adjustments to the ramps), permitting multiple motor skills to be learned without interference. The ability to learn new motor skills without interfering with old ones is essential to our ability to acquire and maintain a broad motor repertoire. During learning, the motor system makes a series of adjustments to the motor plans and control processes engaged during movements. The knowledge acquired during this process—the dynamics of the body and the environment, along with effective control strategies for dealing with them—is retained as a motor memory. This learning can be precisely operationalized in the laboratory setting by asking human participants to make reaching movements while holding the handle of a manipulandum that generates a force field (Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi, 1994Shadmehr R. Mussa-Ivaldi F.A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3208-3224PubMed Google Scholar). Through time, the participant becomes familiar with the structure of this force field and learns to generate predictive compensatory forces that lead to the desired movements straight to the target. These predictive forces can be directly observed by constructing a force channel that constrains the hand to the direct path toward the target. If the force field is later removed, the learned structure of the environment can be measured as aftereffects, where the predictive forces curve the hand trajectories in the opposite direction of the now-absent force field. The representation of the force field dynamics is believed to be learned through small adjustments to a motor memory after each trial. However, if the adjustments made to the memory during learning cancel out, the learning process is ineffective. For example, if participants are asked to move through a curl force field whose direction alternates or switches randomly from trial to trial, the opposing learning directions interfere and neither environment is learned. This interference can be substantially reduced by associating each field with a unique contextual cue, including some classes of sensory cues and differences in the physical or visual state of the limb during movement (Howard et al., 2013Howard I.S. Wolpert D.M. Franklin D.W. J. Neurophysiol. 2013; 109: 2632-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that associating each field with a unique preceding lead-in movement (Howard et al., 2012Howard I.S. Ingram J.N. Franklin D.W. Wolpert D.M. J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 12756-12768Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or subsequent follow-through movement (Howard et al., 2015Howard I.S. Wolpert D.M. Franklin D.W. Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 397-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) substantially reduces interference. These experiments collectively suggest that appropriate contextual cues can segregate learning of the opposing force field into distinct motor memories, enabling context-appropriate compensatory forces to be generated in each context. In this issue of Neuron, Sheahan and colleagues perform a set of experiments that provide fundamental new insight into the mechanism by which separate motor memories are independently learned and recalled. Through clever experimental design, the authors dissociate the role of motor planning from that of execution in separating motor memories associated with distinct environmental dynamics. In their task, participants move a manipulandum toward a primary target through a velocity-dependent curl force field whose direction randomly switches across trials. The direction of the force field was perfectly associated with the location of a secondary reach target, located northeast or northwest of the first target. One group of participants (“full follow-through”) was shown both the primary and secondary target and asked to move to both targets in succession (Howard et al., 2015Howard I.S. Wolpert D.M. Franklin D.W. Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 397-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As expected, the follow-through movements to the different secondary targets successfully separates the motor memories for the two fields, reducing interference and facilitating learning for this group. In contrast, a second group (“no follow-through”) did not perform any follow-through movements and was unable to learn either environment due to interference, even though the secondary target location was visible before each trial and cued the direction of the field. To dissociate the contributions of movement planning and execution, two additional groups were included. For a third group (“execution only”), the secondary target appears only mid-movement to the primary target, such that the direction of the follow-through movement and the force field is not available during the preparation period before the initial movement. In this setup, a participant could potentially associate the two fields with the distinct follow-through movements, even if this information would not be immediately available during learning trials. In probe trials with a force channel, however, the secondary target was presented at the same time as the initial target, such that the participant could theoretically recall the motor memory associated with the cued follow-through movement and generate the appropriate compensatory forces. However, this was not the case: this group showed no significant reduction in interference relative to the “no follow-through” group. Evidently, merely executing the different follow-through movements associated with each field is insufficient to separate the motor memories. Instead, using a fourth group of participants (“planning only”), Sheahan and colleagues demonstrate that information about the follow-through movement must be available before the initial movement is executed in order to dissociate the motor memories and facilitate learning of both fields. In this group, both targets are presented simultaneously, but the secondary targets were extinguished during the initial movement, and participants were instructed not to perform the subsequent movement when this occurred. To encourage planning of the follow-through movement, in force channel trials (four of twelve in each block), the secondary targets were not extinguished and follow-through movements were performed. In this group, even though the follow-through movements were never actually performed when the force field was present (non-channel trials), interference between the memories was substantially reduced and learning was similar to the “full follow-through” group. Collectively, these results demonstrate that it is motor planning, and not execution, that is responsible for the establishment of multiple separate memories. This suggests that a distinct motor memory is engaged during the preparation stage and that the subsequently experienced force field will modify only that particular motor memory. One intriguing aspect of these findings is that they square nicely with recent work on motor cortical neurophysiology in non-human primates. This line of work takes a dynamical systems perspective of motor cortex, refocusing on its role as a temporal pattern generation circuit to support movement production through spinal cord circuitry (Shenoy et al., 2013Shenoy K.V. Sahani M. Churchland M.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 36: 337-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). These time-varying patterns are generated by the dynamics of motor cortical circuits and are seen in the activity of neuronal populations. To produce the correct patterns for a given movement, the dynamical system in motor cortex must be seeded with an appropriate initial condition, which appears to occur during the preparation phase. As we learn to compensate for a force field, synaptic plasticity adjusts the dynamical trajectory followed by the neuronal population activity during motor execution, leading to the production of new forces at each point in time. Within this framework, if the modifications due to both fields are made around a single dynamical trajectory, initiated from the same preparatory neural activity state, interference will occur (Figure 1B). In Sheahan and colleagues’ experiments, the distinct, planned follow-through movements likely bring the motor cortical population activity to two separate preparatory states, which lead into two separate dynamical trajectories during movement (Figure 1C). Learning-induced changes could then modify the distinct, local dynamics around each trajectory independently, which can then be recalled during subsequent movements that invoke the appropriate preparatory state. Returning to our bike ramp analogy, by constructing a second ramp and digging out a new approach to the ramp designed for the new trick you wish to learn, you can independently modify this second ramp as needed to adjust your speed approaching the ramp. It appears the motor system employs a similar strategy, exchanging the initial position and trajectory of the bike for those of the neural population activity state and leveraging synaptic plasticity in lieu of a shovel. Several experiments have characterized some of the neurophysiological consequences of motor learning in similar force field reaching tasks in non-human primates. Changes to neural responses during motor learning have been observed in primary motor cortex (M1), dorsal and ventral premotor cortex (PMd and PMv), and supplementary motor area (SMA) (e.g., Xiao et al., 2006Xiao J. Padoa-Schioppa C. Bizzi E. Exp. Brain Res. 2006; 168: 106-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These reports have primarily analyzed neural responses through the lens of tuning curves (response as a function of reach direction) and preferred directions. Through this lens, there is an overall average trend for neurons to rotate their directional tuning curve in a direction concordant with compensating for the curl field being learned. Nevertheless, the changes appear confusing and heterogeneous at the level of individual neurons. Some of the changes observed in individual, so-called memory neurons persist through a subsequent washout period when the force field is removed. One could hypothesize that although the instantaneous relationship between neural tuning and movement direction is unreliable, learning-induced changes will become clearer when viewed as systematic modifications to the neural population activity trajectory. The time would appear ripe to revisit these neurophysiological findings from a dynamical systems perspective of motor cortex. When multiple motor memories are learned or recalled independently, an intriguing possibility is that learning exploits “output-null” dimensions in motor cortex to separate memories. These extra dimensions exist because there are many more neurons in motor cortex (and linearly independent patterns of neural activity) than there are skeletal muscles to control. Recently, it was demonstrated that motor cortex uses some of these output-null dimensions for motor preparation and local computation, allowing firing rates to change without affecting downstream circuitry or causing movement of the body (Kaufman et al., 2014Kaufman M.T. Churchland M.M. Ryu S.I. Shenoy K.V. Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This extra neural flexibility also enables the motor cortex to produce the same movement even as its neural population activity state traverses distinct neural trajectories, as is the case for identical reaches performed with and without a preceding delay period (Ames et al., 2014Ames K.C. Ryu S.I. Shenoy K.V. Neuron. 2014; 81: 438-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We anticipate that similar neural mechanisms enable our ability to recall distinct motor memories even when producing the same kinematic movement (Hirashima and Nozaki, 2012Hirashima M. Nozaki D. Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: 432-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). One could speculate that neuronal variability, thought to enable motor learning through exploration (Tumer and Brainard, 2007Tumer E.C. Brainard M.S. Nature. 2007; 450: 1240-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), would produce a spread of preparatory states that could be subject to partially independent motor learning as well. Another promising connection between motor behavior and physiology lies in the connection with sequences of motor movements and the separation of motor memories associated with these sequences. SMA, PMd, PMv, and M1 all show sequence-related neural activity, in which individual neurons can encode the entire sequence, specific movements within a sequence, or transitions between specific successive movements. Recently, Lu and Ashe, 2015Lu X. Ashe J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2015; 42: 2172-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar demonstrated that when a single movement within an over-learned sequence is changed, sequence-specific M1 activity is completely disrupted. This suggests that sequential memories are encoded as a cohesive entity, rather than as a series of individual sub-movements. Future experiments in non-human primates could further elucidate this close link between the neurophysiological encoding of motor sequences with sequence-specific motor memories. Moreover, sequence learning could be an especially interesting substrate with which to probe the interactions between cortical motor areas and the cerebellum and basal ganglia, which are critically important for skill acquisition and motor control. Bridging the gap between computational theories of motor control and their neural substrate is a challenging but important goal for the field of motor neuroscience. This gap has arisen, in part, because the mapping between the implementation level and the algorithmic and computational levels of description is not one to one; there are often many potential neural implementations of any particular computation. Nevertheless, insightful experiments like those conducted by Sheahan, Franklin, and Wolpert can make direct predictions linking the neural dynamics of motor cortical implementation with the computations of motor learning. One can envision many future experiments that leverage this rich body of theoretical and computational work alongside novel tools for observing, perturbing, and modeling neural populations. This approach is likely to yield key insights into the mechanisms of motor learning and control.

https://openalex.org/W2549178423,"Cell migration to chemoattractants is critically important in both normal physiology and the pathogenesis of many diseases. In GPCR-mediated chemotaxis, GPCRs transduce the gradient of an extracellular chemotactic ligand into intracellular responses via the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. However, ligand-induced G-protein activation has not been directly imaged as yet in mammalian chemotaxing cells. We developed a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe, R10-Gi, by linking the Gi-protein α subunit to the regulator of G-protein signaling domain. The R10-Gi probe was coupled with a chemoattractant leukotriene B4 (LTB4) receptor 1 (BLT1) that induced the receptor to display a high-affinity ligand binding activity (Kd = 0.91 nM) in HEK293 cells. The R10-Gi probe exhibited an increased FRET signal in accord with the LTB4-dependent activation of Gi. Furthermore, neutrophil-like differentiated human leukemia cell line 60 that expressed the intrinsic BLT1 displayed temporal Gi-protein activation in an area localized to the leading edge during chemotaxis in a shallow gradient of LTB4. These findings afford an opportunity to clarify the mechanisms underlying the subcellular regulation of Gi-protein activity, as well as GPCR-mediated ligand sensing, during chemotaxis in mammalian cells.—Masuda, K., Kitakami, J., Kozasa, T., Kodama, T., Ihara, S., Hamakubo, T.

https://openalex.org/W2551084338,"By monitoring gases emitted from the mouths of volcanoes, scientists could provide days to weeks of warning before an eruption. The latest evidence comes from studies of volcanoes monitored as part of the Volcano Deep Earth Carbon Degassing initiative, where scientists used hardy, long-lived sensors to measure the ratio of carbon to sulfur gases emitted before eruptions. In principle, a jump in the ratio can signal when a fresh injection of magma is rising from deep in the crust—a prelude to an eruption. The ratio changes because carbon dioxide dissolved in rising magma bubbles out at depths of 10 kilometers or more, as the pressure drops. Sulfur-rich gases, in contrast, stay in solution up to shallower depths. A spike in the ratio provides warning that a batch of magma has risen above a deep threshold. A subsequent drop in the ratio could indicate that the magma has climbed farther still, to depths where sulfur gases are released, but this has not been observed reliably. The studies offer hope that geochemical monitoring of gases could someday join the two geophysical mainstays of forecasting: tracking the swelling of Earth's surface and the rise in the earthquakes that typically precedes eruptions."
