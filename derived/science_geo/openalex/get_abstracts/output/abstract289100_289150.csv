https://openalex.org/W1964373309,"The presence of leaf pubescence (leaf hairs) in Encelia farinosa, a desert species of the Composite family, reduces the absorptance of photosynthetically active radiation (400 to 700 nanometers) by as much as 56 percent more than a closely related but nonpubescent species, E. californica, a native of the relatively moist southern California coast. Pubescence in E. farinosa, which increases through the growing season, modifies the leaf energy balance and dramatically reduces the photosynthetic rate. The reduction in the photosynthetic rate is caused by decreased light absorption rather than decreased carbon dioxide conductance through the boundary layer."

An anticyclonic gyre is nearly always found in the western gulf, and we suggest that there is a typical western boundary current, similar in many important respects to the Gulf Stream. The flow appears to be strongest in winter and summer, in phase with the wind curl forcing, and there is evidence that this response is at least partially baroclinic. The deep baroclinic gyre persists when the wind curl vanishes. The winter transport is roughly half that of the Florida Current."

 not only practicing physicians, but professional workers in experimental medicine."
