https://openalex.org/W2009224215,"Shape-selective hydrocarbon catalysis, such as the conversion capability of zealite catalysts of the ZSM-5 type to produce high-grade gasoline from methanol, can be extended to produce a similar gasoline or aromatics from plant extracts. Examples are rubber latex, corn oil, and peanut oil. Novel mechanisms for shape-selective reaction sequences are demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2086802492,"Adult Drosophila melanogaster have previously been conditioned with shock to avoid various odors. In these experiments, larvae also sensed airborne odorants, responded to electric shock, and learned. Larval behavior paralleled adult behavior for (i) a mutant, smellblind, which failed to respond to odorants; (ii) three mutants, dunce, turnip, and cabbage, which were deficient in olfactory learning ability; and (iii) a mutant heterozygote, turnip/+, which learned but also forgot rapidly."
https://openalex.org/W2048778880,Throttling of freshwater inputs into the meromictic Dead Sea weakened the long-term stability of the water column. Between 1975 and 1978 successive deepenings of the pycnocline from 70 meters to beyond 200 meters were recorded. Complete overturn finally took place during the winter of 1978-1979. This unique process was accompanied by changes in the geochemistry of several components.
https://openalex.org/W2061105264,"An analysis of existing thermodynamic, photochemical, and kinetic data indicates that the dominant sinks for atmospheric carbon tetrafluoride (CF(4)) are in and above the mesosphere. Theoretical calculations predict an atmospheric residence time for CF(4) of over 10,000 years, about 100 times that for dichlorodifluoromethane (CF(2)Cl(2)) and monofluorotrichloromethane (CFC1(3)). It is predicted that CF(4) will be well mixed through the stratosphere and mesosphere; only one or two parts of hydrogen fluoride in 10(12) are predicted in the high stratosphere as a result of the decomposition of CF(4). Although natural sources of CF(4) cannot be ruled out, there are several likely industrial sources that may account for its present concentration. The principal environmental effect of CF(4) could be the trapping of outgoing planetary infrared energy in its intense bands near 8 micrometers."

These ""spectral lines"" and their widths form a code identifying the material composition of the inclusion in a way that resembles spectroscopy. This idea finds applications in geophysics, materials science, and any field dealing with materials containing inclusions."

https://openalex.org/W2090845302,"Stimulus generalization has been observed for discriminative, eliciting, and emotional functions of stimuli. In our study, in order to investigate the generalization of the reinforcing function of stimuli, pigeons were trained in a Skinner box to peck at an unlighted key to obtain aperiodic, brief exposures of light at a wavelength of 550 mmicro, the positive conditioned reinforcer, which was immediately followed by food reward. Testing in extinction, we obtained generalization gradients for the number of responses and the time the pigeons expended to produce exposures on the unlighted key of 550 mmicro, 530 mmicro) 510 mmicro, or no light. This finding suggests that stimulus generalization occurs with all functions of stimuli."
