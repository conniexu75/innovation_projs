https://openalex.org/W139206345,"We reported in a previous communication (1) that guanidoacetic acid is methylated to creatine by rat liver slices in the presence of choline and either homocysteine or homocystine. Choline, homocystine, or homocysteine alone had little or no effect. These observations closed the gap which had existed between the evidence from tissue slice experiments on the one hand (2) and that from experiments in viva on the other (3-5) regarding the transfer of choline methyl in the formation of creatine."

https://openalex.org/W127686940,"At the 1941 annual meeting of t,he American Society of Biological Chemists, one of us presented evidence that the amino acid composition of the egg may be influenced by feeding the hen a diet rich in protein (1). We now offer experimental results showing how the methionine and cystine content of the egg can be changed by varying the protein in the hen’s diet according to its high or low methionine content. McFarlane, Fulmer, and Jukes (2) found no changes in the amino acid composition of the egg proteins when they varied the basal diet of the hens from 10 to 16 per cent crude protein. A higher protein supplement, as a dietary influence would have been more appropriate to test the constancy of the amino acid composition of the egg proteins. r’alvery and Titus (3) did not observe any change in the amino nitrogen distribution in egg albumin and vitellin prepared from eggs laid by hens fed a diet in which the protein n-as furnished exclusively by wheat, corn, or soy bean. Similar feeding experiments were carried out with pigeons by Gerber and Carr (4). They observed differences in the N distribution in the egg proteins (Van Slyke) and in the immunological behavior in rats sensitized to egg prot.eins. Their finding points to the probability of change in the amino acid composition of the egg protein induced by the ingestion of the various feeds. If the amino acid composition of the different egg proteins is considered constant, then an increase in an amino acid in the egg may mean that the protein content of the egg has increased or that the proportions of the various egg proteins have changed. An increase in total protein content would naturally bring about proportional increases in all of the amino acids, and the cystine-methionine ratio would not be changed. However, we will show that the cystine-methionine ratio does not remain constant and that the levels of these two amino acids are independent of the t.ot.al N in the wg. Variations in the protein components of egg white were noted by Longsworth, Cannan, and MacInnes (5). They found that the albumin content"

This substance has now been recognized as an aldehyde, and its formation involves a molecular rearrangement,: N.CH = C: →: N—C(CHO):. It is noteworthy that the reverse transformation can be realized. Catalytic reduction of the aldehyde in alcoholic solution gives a dihydro-derivative, probably the related primary alcohol; in acetic acid solution an isomeride is produced in addition, and this is converted with great ease by dilute mineral acids into neostrychnine. Nitrous acid transforms neostrychnine into a ketoxime-formamide,: N.CH: C: →: N.CHO HON: C:, which is hydrolysed by dilute hydrochloric acid to hydroxylamine, formic acid and a hydrochloride, C20 H23 O3 N2 Cl. This is a salt of a sec-basic ketone."

https://openalex.org/W1976038733,"PHASE-CONTRAST' methods have recently been JL widely used to improve the visibility of small transparent objects. The illumination is restricted to a narrow cone by means of an annular diaphragm placed under the condenser, and the direct beam passes through a conjugate annular 'phase-plate' near the upper principal focus of the objective. A theoretical explanation of the effect was given in the original paper by Zernike. It appears to me, however, that Zernike's explanation is insufficient through the omission of an important physical factor, which seems to have been only partly recognized in the later paperby Kohler and Loos. “The details of such an object (transparent) are distinguished only by unequal thickness or refractive index, i.e., they impose on the incident light only phase differences.” This statement by Zernike ignores the effect of the inclination of the surfaces that is in fact nearly always present. Methods which render inclined surfaces visible have long been employed by mineralogists for refractive index determination by the Becke line and Schroeder effect. The accompanying photographs (a-l) suggest that useful contrast may be obtained by an arrangement of opaque stops, without the use of a 'phase-plate'. It may perhaps be convenient to use the term 'stop-contrast' to distinguish this method from that involving the use of the phase-plate."

https://openalex.org/W2077846095,"A FEW examples of the occurrence of aromatization of alicyclic compounds in the animal body are known, and similar reactions have been suggested in the formation of sex hormones and possibly carcinogens from sterols and bile acids1. Hitherto, however, the reaction has not been demonstrated in isolated tissues. The ready conversion of cyclo hexane carboxylic acid to benzoic acid by the dog, man and rabbit2 suggested investigation of this transformation as a preliminary to the fuller study of aromatization in tissues. Rabbits of about 2.8 kgm. weight were first fed or injected subcutaneously with doses of 1.6–2.6 gm. sodium cyclo hexane carboxylate, of which about 0.9 gm. was isolated in the form of hippuric acid from the urine passed in the next 24 hours, thus confirming the work of Bernhard2, and showing an adequate rate of aromatization. A method was evolved3 for the micro-estimation of benzoic or hippuric acid in presence of cyclo hexane carboxylic acid, depending on cold nitration to the m-nitro derivative, reduction of the latter to the amino-compound, and estimation by diazotization and coupling with N-(l-naphthyl)-ethylene diamine."

https://openalex.org/W2047997652,IT was reported in a previous communication1 that peracetic acid reacts with α- and β-diisobutylenes to give an unsaturated alcohol and high-boiling material of the molecular formula C16H32O3 in addition to the expected glycol. Thus β-diisobutylene (I) yields the unsaturated alcohol (II) with alteration in the position of the double bond ; α-diisobutylene (III) gives rise to the two unsaturated alcohols (IV) and (V).

https://openalex.org/W2018691436,"IF we place, on the stage of a microscope, a slide coated with a thin but opaque metal film pierced by small apertures of distinctive shapes and sizes, there is no doubt as to how its image should appear. We expect to see a dark field surrounding bright areas geometrically similar to the apertures, though on a larger scale. Suppose, however, that the object is a very thin section of some biological structure, for example, a nerve with many component fibres. The various parts of the cellular structure have little difference in their relative transmission for ordinary light, and only differ optically in their refractive indices. What should the image look like ?"

Although not a State institution, the Academy is conducted under the aegis of, and is endowed by, the State. It consists of two Sections (Klassen), the Mathematical and Natural Science Section for mathematics, natural science, medicine and technical science, and the Philosophical and Historical Section for philosophy, history and archaeology, art and music, language and literature, geography and ethnology, law, political science and economics. The Sections meet separately every fortnight for the consideration and discussion of scientific subjects, and they have a joint session once a month."

https://openalex.org/W1992418455,"Now that tubocurarine, one of the curare alkaloids, is gaining importance in medicine, it is important that this compound and other curare-like substances should be biologically standardized. A suitable method has been described by Chou1, utilizing the rat's phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation of Bulbring2 ; but we have been unable to obtain consistent results with this technique. By using temperatures lower than usual for mammalian tissue work (namely, room temperature, about 20° C), we have obtained satisfactory results. The preparation lasts for a much longer period of time, shows little sign of fatigue after eight hours, and contractions are more regular. Larger doses of tubocurarine are needed than those used at 37° C., and a reduction in contraction of approximately 50 per cent is obtained with 0.15 mgm."
