However, to date the existence of these species of black holes remains ambiguous and their formation process is therefore unknown. It has been long suspected that black holes with masses $10^{2}-10^{4}M_{\odot}$ should form and reside in dense stellar systems. Therefore, dedicated observational campaigns have targeted globular cluster for many decades searching for signatures of these elusive objects. All candidates found in these targeted searches appear radio dim and do not have the X-ray to radio flux ratio predicted by the fundamental plane for accreting black holes. Based on the lack of an electromagnetic counterpart upper limits of $2060 M_{\odot}$ and $470 M_{\odot}$ have been placed on the mass of a putative black hole in 47 Tucanae (NGC 104) from radio and X-ray observations respectively. Here we show there is evidence for a central black hole in 47 Tuc with a mass of M$_{\bullet}\sim2300 M_{\odot}$$_{-850}^{+1500}$ when the dynamical state of the globular cluster is probed with pulsars. The existence of an intermediate mass black hole in the centre of one of the densest clusters with no detectable electromagnetic counterpart suggests that the black hole is not accreting at a sufficient rate and therefore contrary to expectations is gas starved. This intermediate mass black hole might be a member of electromagnetically invisible population of black holes that are the elusive seeds leading to the formation of supermassive black holes in galaxies."

Instead, more focus has been directed towards the importance of cognitive abilities, and it has been suggested that executive functions (EF) are fundamentally important for success in soccer. However, executive functions are going through a steep development from adolescence to adulthood. Moreover, more complex EF involving manipulation of information (higher level EF) develop later than simple executive functions such as those linked to simple working memory capacity (Core EF). The link between EF and success in young soccer players is therefore not obvious. In the present study we investigated whether EF are associated with success in soccer in young elite soccer players. We performed tests measuring core EF (a demanding working memory task involving a variable n-back task; dWM) and higher level EF (Design Fluency test; DF). Color-Word Interference Test and Trail Making Test were performed on an exploratory level as they contain a linguistic element. The lower level EF test (dWM) was taken from CogStateSport computerized concussion testing and the higher level EF test (DF) was from Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System test battery (D-KEFS). In a group of young elite soccer players (n = 30; aged 12-19 years) we show that they perform better than the norm in both the dWM (+0.49 SD) and DF (+0.86 SD). Moreover, we could show that both dWM and DF correlate with the number of goals the players perform during the season. The effect was more prominent for dWM (r = 0.437) than for DF (r = 0.349), but strongest for a combined measurement (r = 0.550). The effect was still present when we controlled for intelligence, length and age in a partial correlation analysis. Thus, our study suggests that both core and higher level EF may predict success in soccer also in young players."
https://openalex.org/W2586254930,"The host proteins, SERINC3 and SERINC5, have been recently shown to incorporate into HIV-1 particles and compromise their ability to fuse with target cells, an effect that is antagonized by the viral Nef protein. Envelope (Env) glycoproteins from different HIV-1 isolates exhibit a broad range of sensitivity to SERINC-mediated restriction, and the mechanism by which SERINCs interfere with HIV-1 fusion remains unclear. Here, we show that incorporation of SERINC5 into virions in the absence of Nef inhibits the formation of small fusion pores between viruses and cells. Strikingly, we found that SERINC5 promotes spontaneous functional inactivation of sensitive but not resistant Env glycoproteins. Although SERINC5-Env interaction was not detected by co-immunoprecipitation, incorporation of this protein enhanced the exposure of the conserved gp41 domains and sensitized the virus to neutralizing antibodies and gp41-derived inhibitory peptides. These results imply that SERINC5 restricts HIV-1 fusion at a step prior to small pore formation by selectively inactivating sensitive Env glycoproteins, likely through altering their conformation. The increased HIV-1 sensitivity to anti-gp41 antibodies and peptides suggests that SER5 also delays refolding of the remaining fusion-competent Env trimers."

Hydropower could replace a large part of the contribution of gas and oil to the present energy mix. However, previous high-resolution estimates of hydropower potential have been local, and have yet to be applied on a global scale. This study is the first to formally present a detailed evaluation of the hydropower potential of each location, based on slope and discharge of each river in the world. The gross theoretical hydropower potential is approximately 52 PWh/year divided over 11.8 million locations. This 52 PWh/year is equal to 33% of the annually required energy, while the present energy production by hydropower plants is just 3% of the annually required energy. The results of this study: all potentially interesting locations for hydroelectric power plants, are available online."
https://openalex.org/W2587195208,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare lung disease of unknown origin leading rapidly to death. This paper addresses the issue of whether sputum induction is a suitable tool to study respiratory tract inflammation and potential biomarkers in IPF compared to COPD, a fibrosing airway wall disease.In a cross-sectional analysis, 15 IPF patients, 32 COPD and 30 healthy subjects underwent sputum induction. Total sputum cell counts and the amount of TGF- β, IGF-1, IGF-2, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, IL-8, IL-13, MMP-7, MMP-9, YKL-40, TNF-α and KL-6 in sputum supernatant were analysed. We also profiled gene expression of cells in the induced sputum for TGF-β, MMP-7, YKL-40, IGFBP-2, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α.IPF patients, like COPD, had increased sputum absolute number of neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages and epithelial cells compared to HS. IPF sputum supernatants had increased concentrations of IGFBP-2, IL-8, TGF-β, MMP-7, MMP-9 and KL-6 (p<0.05, p<0.0001, p<0.05, p<0.05, p<0.0001, p<0.05 respectively) when compared to healthy subjects where COPD had higher IL-6 and TNF-α levels than IPF (p<0.05 and p<0.05 respectively) and HS (p<0.0001 and p<0.001 respectively) and higher IL-8 and MMP-9 than HS (p<0.0001 and p<0.001 respectively). Conversely to IL-6 and TNF-α, MMP-7 was increased in IPF compared to COPD (p<0.05). The KL-6 and MMP-7 protein levels in sputum were inversely correlated with total lung capacity (TLC, % of predicted) in IPF patients (r = -0.73 and r = -0.53 respectively). Sputum gene expression analysis identified a significant increase for IGFBP-2, IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-7 in IPF compared to HS (p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.05 and p<0.0001 respectively) and for IGFBP-2, YKL-40, IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-7 compared to COPD (p<0.01, p<0.01, p<0.05, p<0.01 and p<0.0001 respectively). Furthermore, gene expression of TGF-β was increased in IPF compared to COPD (p<0.001) but not to HS.Our data show clear increase in expression and production of IGFBP-2, IL-8 and MMP-7 in sputum from patients with IPF that may contribute to the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2586478664,"Background Inferring a gene regulatory network from time-series gene expression data in systems biology is a challenging problem. Many methods have been suggested, most of which have a scalability limitation due to the combinatorial cost of searching a regulatory set of genes. In addition, they have focused on the accurate inference of a network structure only. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop a network inference method to search regulatory genes efficiently and to predict the network dynamics accurately. Results In this study, we employed a Boolean network model with a restricted update rule scheme to capture coarse-grained dynamics, and propose a novel mutual information-based Boolean network inference (MIBNI) method. Given time-series gene expression data as an input, the method first identifies a set of initial regulatory genes using mutual information-based feature selection, and then improves the dynamics prediction accuracy by iteratively swapping a pair of genes between sets of the selected regulatory genes and the other genes. Through extensive simulations with artificial datasets, MIBNI showed consistently better performance than six well-known existing methods, REVEAL, Best-Fit, RelNet, CST, CLR, and BIBN in terms of both structural and dynamics prediction accuracy. We further tested the proposed method with two real gene expression datasets for an Escherichia coli gene regulatory network and a fission yeast cell cycle network, and also observed better results using MIBNI compared to the six other methods. Conclusions Taken together, MIBNI is a promising tool for predicting both the structure and the dynamics of a gene regulatory network."
https://openalex.org/W2587374473,"The Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE) measures the frequency of positive and negative affect. It consists of two subscales, one for positive and one for negative affect with six adjectives each and assesses a broad range of emotions. In this study, the psychometric properties of the German version of the scale were explored with reliability and confirmatory factorial analysis by using a German sample of N = 498. To examine the convergent validity of the SPANE we correlated its subscales with other well-being and happiness measures. Retest-reliabilities were tested after four weeks, taking into account the occurrence of emotionally significant life events. The scale was also applied to evaluate a training of subjective well-being and in a study on text comprehensibility. The results confirmed the postulated two-factor structure of the SPANE and showed good psychometric properties and convergent validity. In conclusion, the German version of the scale behaves in accordance with the original scale and may be used in future studies of well-being."
https://openalex.org/W2586893617,"Peptide antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins initiates CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity against pathogens and cancers. MHC I molecules typically bind peptides with 9 amino acids in length with both ends tucked inside the major A and F binding pockets. It has been known for a while that longer peptides can also bind by either bulging out of the groove in the middle of the peptide or by binding in a zigzag fashion inside the groove. In a recent study, we identified an alternative binding conformation of naturally occurring peptides from Toxoplasma gondii bound by HLA-A*02:01. These peptides were extended at the C terminus (PΩ) and contained charged amino acids not more than 3 residues after the anchor amino acid at PΩ, which enabled them to open the F pocket and expose their C-terminal extension into the solvent. Here, we show that the mechanism of F pocket opening is dictated by the charge of the first charged amino acid found within the extension. Although positively charged amino acids result in the Tyr-84 swing, amino acids that are negatively charged induce a not previously described Lys-146 lift. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the peptides with alternative binding modes have properties that fit very poorly to the conventional MHC class I pathway and suggest they are presented via alternative means, potentially including cross-presentation via the MHC class II pathway.

Peptide presentation by MHC class I molecules regulates which fragments of a pathogen or cancer antigen are displayed to cytotoxic T cells for immune recognition. Understanding the mechanism of antigen presentation by MHC I is crucial in an attempt to design therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating subsequent immune responses to control disease. Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease caused by infection with the large intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii (1.Montoya J.G. Liesenfeld O.

Although generally asymptomatic in healthy adults, T. gondii infection can cause congenital toxoplasmosis during pregnancy and result in abortion or neonatal disease (1.Montoya J.G. Liesenfeld O.

T cell-mediated immunity against T. gondii-derived peptide antigens provides strong protection against T. gondii and involves both peptide presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) and class II (MHC II) proteins (3.Cong H.

Generally, most canonical peptide ligands for MHC I are 9–10 amino acids in length.

These long peptides have been shown to interact with the residues of the binding groove of HLA class I heavy (α) chain much like the canonical binders with some changes. The second (P2) and C-terminal (PΩ) residues of the antigen peptide anchor into the A and F pockets of the binding groove, respectively, whereas the middle portion of these oversized peptides either “bulge out” or “zigzag” in the binding groove to be accommodated (18.Schaible U.E.

In contrast to these “bulged” peptides, we recently identified longer T. gondii peptides eluted from HLA-A*02:01 molecules that had a conserved N-terminal start but differed in their residue composition at the C terminus (20.McMurtrey C. Trolle T. Sansom T. Remesh S.G. Kaever T. Bardet W. Jackson K. McLeod R. Sette A. Nielsen M. Zajonc D.M. Blader I.J. Peters B. Hildebrand W. Toxoplasma gondii peptide ligands open the gate of the HLA class I binding groove.Elife. 2016; 5: e12556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed through crystallographic studies that in the HLA-A*02:01 complex with one 12-mer peptide residue Tyr-84 of the MHC heavy chain swung out and opened the F pocket, allowing the C-terminal amino acid of the peptide to protrude into the solvent, whereas the nested 11-mer N-terminal core peptide bound in a conventional zigzag orientation tucked with both peptide ends inside the peptide binding groove. To further investigate whether the opening of the binding groove could be achieved with other peptides presented on T. gondii-infected cells and to understand what the structural requirements are to enable such unconventional modes of binding, we crystallized complexes of HLA-A*02:01 with several pairs of core (nested) and C-terminally extended peptides. Surprisingly, we found that that there are at least two distinct modes of opening the F pocket of HLA-A*02:01 involving the residues Tyr-84 and Lys-146. We suggest that these unconventional modes of binding will help better understand targets of MHC class I-restricted epitope recognition. To identify additional peptides with likely unconventional binding motifs, we scanned the set of peptides eluted from HLA-A*02:01 for those that had poor predicted binding affinity of the full-length peptide (percentile rank >10%) but contained a nested N-terminal peptide with high predicted affinity (percentile rank <2%). In our previous study, we had examined one such peptide (FVLELEPEWTVK), which had a single lysine added to the C terminus of the core peptide (FVLELEPEWTV) and induced a structural change in Tyr-84 of HLA-A*02:01 (20.McMurtrey C. Trolle T. Sansom T. Remesh S.G. Kaever T. Bardet W. Jackson K. McLeod R. Sette A. Nielsen M. Zajonc D.M. Blader I.J. Peters B. Hildebrand W. Toxoplasma gondii peptide ligands open the gate of the HLA class I binding groove.Elife. 2016; 5: e12556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in the current study, we examined three sets of peptides that had C-terminal amino acid additions that contained negatively charged amino acids or both negatively and positively charged residues (Fig. 1). To investigate whether the F pocket of HLA-A*02:01 could also be opened by these extending peptides, we refolded HLA-A*02:01 with several nested and extending peptides and determined the crystal structures of these complexes. We obtained crystal structures for all complexes at resolutions between 1.85 and 2.75 Å (Table 1). Electron densities for all the peptides were well defined over the entire peptide length that is bound within the binding groove, whereas C-terminally extending residues that did not contact HLA-A*02:01 were disordered (Fig. 1). When all the different peptides are compared, slight structural changes in HLA-A*02:01 are observed in the A pocket. Peptides with an N-terminal tyrosine (YLSPIASPL, YLSPIASPLL, and YLSPIASPLLDGKSLR) open the A pocket slightly for the bulky side chain to be accommodated, whereas peptides that begin with glycine (GLKEGIPAL, GLKEGIPALDN, GLLPELPAV, and GLLPELPAVGGNE) are more buried inside the A pocket because they lack any side chain (Fig. 1). In addition, subtle structural changes are observed throughout the binding groove to allow optimal binding of the different amino acid side chains. However, when structures of the core peptides are compared with their respective extended peptides, the position of Tyr-84 of HLA-A*02:01 was unchanged. Surprisingly, however, Lys-146 of the F pocket, which is located close to Tyr-84 and forms a “lid” to bury the PΩ amino acid in the core peptides, moved upward to open the F pocket when the extending peptides were bound (Fig. 1).

In the case of peptide GLKEGIPAL, an extensive hydrogen bond network is seen involving the PΩ leucine residue and residues of the heavy chain that line the binding groove including Asp-76, Thr-80, Tyr-84, Thr-143, Lys-146, and Trp-147 (Fig. 2a, upper panel). In contrast, for the extended peptide GLKEGIPALDN, the hydrogen bond between Lys-146 and terminal carboxyl group of PΩ leucine is replaced with one between Lys-146 and the PΩ+1 aspartate side chain because Lys-146 adopts a different orientation (Fig. 2a, lower panel). In the case of the peptide pair GLLPELPAV and GLLPELPAVGGNE, a similar hydrogen bond network is observed for both peptides with only a minor difference in the crystal structure of the longer peptide. The hydrogen bond interaction between the terminal carboxylate of PΩ valine and Lys-146 is missing in the crystal structure with the longer peptide (Fig. 2b). The same is true for the peptide pair YLSPIASPL and YLSPIASPLLDGKSLR (Fig. 2c). As a result, the change in the orientation of Lys-146 leads to the loss of hydrogen bond formation with the carboxylate of the PΩ amino acid. However, the hydrogen bond interaction between HLA-A*02:01 residue Trp-147 and the backbone oxygen of the P8 amino acid remains conserved. Depending on the amino acid following residue P8, a novel hydrogen bond can be formed with the side chain of a compatible amino acid at PΩ+1 (here Asp-10). Because the C-terminally extending amino acids project away from the peptide binding groove, electron density becomes increasingly disordered as the peptide exits the F pocket (Fig. 1). To determine the relative stability of the individual HLA-A*02:01·peptide complexes, we followed their thermal denaturation by differential scanning fluorimetry. The melting temperatures (Tm) obtained from the melt curves allowed us to compare the stability of the different complexes (Fig. 3). We observed that complexes of HLA-A*02:01 with extended peptides had similar stability to those with their equivalent nested peptides with not more than 8 °C difference between them. For example, the Tm for HLA-A*02:01 complex with GLKEGIPAL is 63 °C, whereas that with its longer peptide counterpart is 61 °C. Addition of 6 extra residues to peptide YLSPIASPLL also only changes the Tm of the complex with peptide YLSPIASPLLDGKSLR by about 7 °C (Fig. 3 and Ref. 20.McMurtrey C. Trolle T. Sansom T. Remesh S.G. Kaever T. Bardet W. Jackson K. McLeod R. Sette A. Nielsen M. Zajonc D.M. Blader I.J. Peters B. Hildebrand W. Toxoplasma gondii peptide ligands open the gate of the HLA class I binding groove.Elife. 2016; 5: e12556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, some of the complexes with nested peptides are as stable as those with longer peptides (compare GLKEGIPAL with GLLPEPPVGGNE; Fig. 3). It is also worth noting that there are some variations in the stability of complexes with different nested peptides. For instance, peptide GLKEGIPAL forms a less stable complex as compared with peptide GLLPELPAV (Fig. 3). Although most interactions between HLA-A*02:01 and the peptides are conserved, there is a significant difference in the hydrogen bond interaction between Tyr-84 and their terminal carboxylate (3.65 Å for G9L and 2.9 Å for G9V; Fig. 2). The lack of an intimate hydrogen bond interaction of the terminal amino acid with Tyr-84 in G9L peptide is likely a major contributor to the reduced melting temperature. Compared with our previous study, we noticed that a single positively charged amino acid addition (compare FVLELEPEWTV and FVLELEPEWTVK; Ref. 20.McMurtrey C. Trolle T. Sansom T. Remesh S.G. Kaever T. Bardet W. Jackson K. McLeod R. Sette A. Nielsen M. Zajonc D.M. Blader I.J. Peters B. Hildebrand W. Toxoplasma gondii peptide ligands open the gate of the HLA class I binding groove.Elife. 2016; 5: e12556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) destabilizes the protein·peptide complex more than extending peptides that follow a short (2-amino acid) negatively charged residue addition (compare GLKEGIPAL with GLKEGIPALDN; Fig. 3). However, longer peptide additions (4–6 amino acids) that contain a negatively charged amino acid (YLSPIASPLL versus YLSPIASPLLDGKSLR and GLLPELPAV versus GLLPELPAVGGNE) reduce the protein·peptide complex to the same extend as the single “Lys” addition found in peptide FVLELEPEWTVK (20.McMurtrey C. Trolle T. Sansom T. Remesh S.G. Kaever T. Bardet W. Jackson K. McLeod R. Sette A. Nielsen M. Zajonc D.M. Blader I.J. Peters B. Hildebrand W. Toxoplasma gondii peptide ligands open the gate of the HLA class I binding groove.Elife. 2016; 5: e12556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This highlights that the structural change involving Tyr-84 of HLA-A*02:01 is more destabilizing than that of Lys-146 when the negatively charged peptide extension is very short. The different orientations of Lys-146 upon binding of the longer peptides open the F pocket of HLA-A*02:01 and are required for the C-terminally extending amino acids to project into the solvent because Lys-146 forms a partial lid above the F pocket held in position by the hydrogen bond interaction of the carboxylate of the C-terminal amino acid (PΩ) of any nested peptide (Figs. 2 and 4). Although the position of Lys-146 is not precisely conserved between the different structures of HLA-A*02:01 bound to the extending peptide, the lift of the residue to accommodate the peptide extension seems to be consistent. In the case of the crystal structure of HLA-A*02:01 with YLSPIASPL, YLSPIASPLL, and YLSPIASPLLDGKSLR, there are variations in the way that the two nested peptides are accommodated in the binding groove. With YLSPIASPL, the binding of the residues is quite conventional with the P2 and PΩ anchor residues binding to the A and F pockets. Surprisingly, however, YLSPIASPLL, the nested peptide with one extra leucine residue at the C-terminal end of the peptide, undergoes a certain extent of bulging to accommodate the terminal leucine residue (PΩ+1 instead of PΩ) as the anchor residue in the F pocket (Fig. 4d). The difference in the binding of these two nested peptides to HLA-A*02:01 underscores the requirement for a sequence motif or particular amino acid features within the bound peptide to induce movement of Lys-146 to open the F pocket. Because a mere increase in length of the peptide does not cause the change in orientation of Lys-146, it is likely that the addition of charged residues within the C-terminal extension is the contributing factor to open the F pocket. Thus, in addition to the previously identified “Tyr-84 swing” to accommodate the peptide FVLELEPEWTVK (UFP(16–27)) (20.McMurtrey C. Trolle T. Sansom T. Remesh S.G. Kaever T. Bardet W. Jackson K. McLeod R. Sette A. Nielsen M. Zajonc D.M. Blader I.J. Peters B. Hildebrand W. Toxoplasma gondii peptide ligands open the gate of the HLA class I binding groove.Elife. 2016; 5: e12556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed a “Lys-146 lift” in HLA-A*02:01 as a second mechanism of opening the F pocket induced by the extending peptides YLSPIASPLLDGKSLR, GLKEGIPALDN, and GLLPELPAVGGNE (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Mechanisms of F pocket opening and peptide sequences. a, “tyrosine swing.” Tyr-84 adopts a different rotamer to open the F pocket and accommodate the longer peptide FVLELEPEWTVK (UFP(16–27)) (15.Cong H.

The previously reported longer peptide contains a C-terminal addition of a positively charged residue (FVLELEPEWTVK) that opens the binding groove using the Tyr-84 swing mechanism. Here, we observed that all extended peptides with a negatively charged residue only open the binding groove using the Lys-146 lift mechanism. This included the peptide YLSPIASPLLDGKSLR, which contains a lysine (positive charge) residue following the aspartate (negative charge), but no Tyr-84 swing was observed. This suggested that the first charged residue determined which of the two distinct structural modes of binding an extended peptide will induce in HLA-A*02:01. Given the discovery of several ligands binding in an unconventional mode, we aimed to assess the generality of these findings. In the T. gondii peptide elution data set, a total of 134 peptides were predicted to bind with conventional P2-PΩ anchors with predicted rank ≤10%. Of the remaining 150 peptides with poor predicted binding, 108 contained a nested strong binder (rank ≤2%) at the N terminus with 1 or more residues extending beyond PΩ. These 108 peptides are expected to be enriched for examples with a similar unconventional mode of binding as those in our structural studies. We classified the ligands into having “negative” or “positive” extension based on the first charged residue found after the nested binding peptide. Nearly half of the extended ligands contained a negatively charged residue as the first charged amino acid within the first 3 residues of the extension, whereas positively charged extensions were less frequent (Fig. 6a). Positive extensions were short (less than 3 residues on average), whereas negative extensions had an average length of 8.7 residues (Fig. 6b). Notably, 66% of the positive extensions consisted of a single or 2 residues compared with only 8% of negative extensions being shorter than 3 amino acids. Considering only the longest version of ligands with extensions of multiple sizes, the average length of negative extensions was of 11.0 residues. Given the unconventional length and mode of binding of the observed extended peptides and given that T. gondii has an unusual compartmentalized life cycle in the cells it infects, we wanted to examine whether the unconventional ligands found had the typical motifs of peptides derived from the conventional MHC class I processing and presentation pathway. As shown in Fig. 6, this was not the case. Extended ligands had significantly lower scores for TAP 2The abbreviations used are: TAPtransporter associated with antigen processingTCRT cell receptorKIRkiller immunoglobulin receptorβ2mhuman β2-microglobulin. transport (Fig. 6c) compared with canonical T. gondii ligands (p = 1.2 × 10−5, Wilcoxon rank sum test) but were not significantly different from those of random peptides (p = 0.34). Similarly, proteasome cleavage scores (Fig. 6d) for extended ligands were significantly lower compared with canonical ligands (p = 5 × 10−16) but were not significantly higher than the random natural peptides (p = 0.24). In other words, long ligands with terminal extensions were predicted to be poor substrates both for proteasome cleavage and TAP transport, suggesting an alternative mechanism for the generation and translocation to MHC class I of these extended ligands. transporter associated with antigen processing T cell receptor killer immunoglobulin receptor human β2-microglobulin. Given the life cycle of T. gondii, it is possible that the unconventional MHC I peptide ligands derived from it are processed and (cross-)presented through the same pathway as MHC II ligands. If that is the case, we would not only expect that these ligands have different amino acid motifs as those found for MHC I ligands (as was shown above) but also that they have a pattern congruent with what is found for MHC II ligands. Accordingly, we examined the amino acid patterns of the C-terminal residues in extended ligands. Remarkably, despite being predominantly negatively charged or uncharged in the first 3 residues of the extension, a large fraction of ligands presented either an arginine or lysine at the very C-terminal residue (42 of 108). If these ligands were cross-presented, we would expect similar trimming motifs in class II ligands, and we examined published data sets of"

Downstream of the B-cell receptor, the key signaling kinases Bruton's tyrosine kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase δ offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention by agents such as ibrutinib, ONO/GS-4059, and idelalisib. Combination therapy with such targeted agents could provide enhanced efficacy due to complimentary mechanisms of action. In this study, we describe both the additive interaction of and resistance mechanisms to idelalisib and ONO/GS-4059 in a model of activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Significant tumor regression was observed with a combination of PI3Kδ and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the mouse TMD8 xenograft. Acquired resistance to idelalisib in the TMD8 cell line occurred by loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog and phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway upregulation, but not by mutation of PIK3CD. Sensitivity to idelalisib could be restored by combining idelalisib and ONO/GS-4059. Further evaluation of targeted inhibitors revealed that the combination of idelalisib and the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 inhibitor GSK2334470 or the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 could partially overcome resistance. Characterization of acquired Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance revealed a novel tumor necrosis factor alpha induced protein 3 mutation (TNFAIP3 Q143*), which led to a loss of A20 protein, and increased p-IκBα. The combination of idelalisib and ONO/GS-4059 partially restored sensitivity in this resistant line. Additionally, a mutation in Bruton's tyrosine kinase at C481F was identified as a mechanism of resistance. The combination activity observed with idelalisib and ONO/GS-4059, taken together with the ability to overcome resistance, could lead to a new therapeutic option in activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. A clinical trial is currently underway to evaluate the combination of idelalisib and ONO/GS-4059 (NCT02457598)."

We have previously demonstrated that ultrasound can identify bony and soft tissue structures in the oral cavity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of using ultrasound to measure facial crestal bone level and thickness. Materials and methods A commercially available medical ultrasound scanner, paired with a 14 MHz imaging probe was used to scan dental and periodontal tissues at the mid-facial site of each tooth on 6 fresh cadavers. The alveolar crest level in relation to the cemento-enamel junction and its thickness on ultrasound images were measured and compared to those on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans and/or direct measurements on a total of 144 teeth. Results The mean crestal bone level measured by means of ultrasound, CBCT and direct measures was 2.66 ± 0.86 mm, 2.51 ± 0.82 mm, and 2.71 ± 1.04 mm, respectively. The mean crestal bone thickness was 0.71 ± 0.44 mm and 0.74 ± 0.34 mm, measured by means of ultrasound and CBCT, respectively. The correlations of the ultrasound readings to the other two methods were between 0.78 and 0.88. The mean absolute differences in crestal bone height and thickness between ultrasound and CBCT were 0.09 mm (-1.20 to 1.00 mm, p = 0.06) and 0.03 mm (-0.48 to 0.54 mm, p = 0.03), respectively. Conclusion Ultrasound was as accurate in determining alveolar bone level and its thickness as CBCT and direct measurements. Clinical trials will be required to further validate this non-ionizing and non-invasive method for determining facial crestal bone position and dimension."
https://openalex.org/W2586472110,"The effect of vehicle active safety systems is subject to the friction force arising from the contact of tires and the road surface. Therefore, an adequate knowledge of the tire-road friction coefficient is of great importance to achieve a good performance of these control systems. This paper presents a tire-road friction coefficient estimation method for an advanced vehicle configuration, four-motorized-wheel electric vehicles, in which the longitudinal tire force is easily obtained. A hierarchical structure is adopted for the proposed estimation design. An upper estimator is developed based on unscented Kalman filter to estimate vehicle state information, while a hybrid estimation method is applied as the lower estimator to identify the tire-road friction coefficient using general regression neural network (GRNN) and Bayes' theorem. GRNN aims at detecting road friction coefficient under small excitations, which are the most common situations in daily driving. GRNN is able to accurately create a mapping from input parameters to the friction coefficient, avoiding storing an entire complex tire model. As for large excitations, the estimation algorithm is based on Bayes' theorem and a simplified “magic formula” tire model. The integrated estimation method is established by the combination of the above-mentioned estimators. Finally, the simulations based on a high-fidelity CarSim vehicle model are carried out on different road surfaces and driving maneuvers to verify the effectiveness of the proposed estimation method."
https://openalex.org/W2586530606,"Although obesity increases the risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), obese patients with RCC experience longer survival than non-obese patients. However, the mechanism of this ""obesity paradox"" is unknown. We examined the impact of preoperative BMI, serum total adiponectin (sAd) level, total adiponectin secretion from perinephric adipose tissue, and intratumoral expression of adiponectin receptors on RCC aggressiveness and survival. We also investigated the mechanism underlying enhanced cancer aggressiveness in RCC cells stimulated with exogenous adiponectin. Overweight and obese patients had significantly lower grade cancers than normal patients in all patients and in those without metastasis (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027, respectively). Cancer-specific survival was significantly longer in overweight and obese patients than in normal patients in all patients (p = 0.035). There was a weak inverse correlation between sAd level and BMI in RCC patients (r = -0.344, p = 0.002). Tumor size was slightly correlated with sAd level, and high sAd was significantly associated with poor overall survival rates in patients with non-metastatic RCC (p = 0.035). Adiponectin levels in perinephric adipose tissue and intratumoral AdipoR1/R2 expression were not correlated with RCC aggressiveness or survival. Proliferation significantly increased in 786-O and Caki-2 cells exposed to exogenous adiponectin, whereas cell invasion and migration were unaffected. In addition, exogenous adiponectin significantly inhibited starvation- and metformin-induced apoptosis, and up-regulated p-AMPK and Bcl-xL levels. In summary, low BMI and high adiponectin levels are associated with aggressive cell behaviors and poor survival in surgically-treated RCC patients. The effects of adiponectin on proliferation and apoptosis might underlie the ""obesity paradox"" of RCC."

We have carried out the most extensive systematic cross-sectional study based on newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive individuals in 2013, and characterized the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequences in the whole of Hebei. Nine HIV-1 genotypes based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequence were identified among 610 newly diagnosed naïve individuals. The four main genotypes were circulating recombinant form (CRF)01_AE (53.4%), CRF07_BC (23.4%), subtype B (15.9%), and unique recombinant forms URFs (4.9%). Within 1 year, three new genotypes (subtype A1, CRF55_01B, CRF65_cpx), unknown before in Hebei, were first found among men who have sex with men (MSM). All nine genotypes were identified in the sexually contracted HIV-1 population. Among 30 URFs, six recombinant patterns were revealed, including CRF01_AE/BC (40.0%), CRF01_AE/B (23.3%), B/C (16.7%), CRF01_AE/C (13.3%), CRF01_AE/B/A2 (3.3%) and CRF01_AE/BC/A2 (3.3%), plus two potential CRFs. This study elucidated the complicated characteristics of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology in a low HIV-1 prevalence northern province of China and revealed the high level of HIV-1 genetic diversity.

Dickkpof-1 (DKK1) and secreted frizzled-related protein-1 (SFRP1) are endogenous negative regulators of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Accumulating evidence indicates that higher serum levels of DKK1 are correlated with poor prognosis of various types of cancer. Here, we investigated whether exercise training causes changes in the serum levels of DKK1 and SFRP1 in patients with breast cancer.Twenty-four breast cancer survivors, after chemo- or radiotherapy, participated in this single-blind randomized, controlled pilot study. Subjects were randomized to either an exercise program or a control group for 12 weeks and completed pre- and post-training tests for health-related fitness and body composition as well as blood biomarkers. The serum levels of DKK1 and SFRP1 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as the primary outcome.Exercise training for 12 weeks remarkably increased muscle strength, endurance, and flexibility and decreased body fat percentage, waist circumference, and visceral fat area (all p < 0.05). Exercise training lowered serum insulin levels and leptin/adiponectin ratios (all p < 0.05). The levels of DKK1 and SFRP1 were also significantly decreased by exercise training in breast cancer survivors (all p < 0.01).Our results indicate that DKK1 and SFRP1 may be potentially useful biomarkers for evaluating the beneficial effects of long-term exercise on physical fitness and metabolism as well as the prognosis of patients with cancer.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02895178."
https://openalex.org/W2587241725,"Introduction Somatic symptoms are frequently reported by children with significant impairment in functioning. Despite studies on adult populations that suggest somatic symptoms often co-occur with difficulties in identifying and describing feelings, little research has been done in childhood. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and frequency of somatic symptoms as well as to investigate the functional impairment in children with high number of self reported somatic symptoms versus those with fewer somatic symptoms. Additionally the parental perception of their children's somatic symptoms and functioning was explored. Finally, we explored the direct and indirect effects of difficulties in identifying feelings in predicting somatic symptoms and functional disability among school-aged children. Methods 356 Italian school-aged children and their mothers participated in this study. Children (mean age = 11.43; SD = 2.41) completed the Children’s Somatization Inventory (CSI-24) to assess somatic symptoms, the Functional Disability Inventory (FDI) to assess physical and psychosocial functioning and the Alexithymia Questionnaire for Children (AQC) to evaluate alexithymic features. Mothers completed the parental forms of the CSI and the FDI. Results Among children, 66.3% did not declare somatic symptoms and 33.7% reported one or more somatic symptoms in the last two weeks. A significant positive correlation emerged between children’s and mothers’ CSI total scores. Both children’s and mothers’ FDI total scores were significantly correlated with CSI scores. A significant correlation was observed between somatic symptoms and alexithymic features. Furthermore, the data showed that somatic symptoms mediated the relationship between difficulties in identifying feelings and functional impairment. Finally, it was showed that alexithymia facet of difficulty in identifying feelings contributed in large part to the prediction of the somatic symptomatology (b = 0.978, p < 0.001; R2 = 0.164, F(5, 350) = 10.32, p < 0.001). Conclusions Findings from this study provide evidence that a higher frequency of somatic symptoms is associated with functional disabilities and alexithymic facets in school-aged children."
https://openalex.org/W2587247430,"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) is one of the most important threats to global banana production. Strategies to control the pathogen are lacking, with plant resistance offering the only long-term solution, if sources of resistance are available. Prevention of introduction of Foc into disease-free areas thus remains a key strategy to continue sustainable banana production. In recent years, strains of Foc affecting Cavendish bananas have destroyed plantations in a number of countries in Asia and in the Middle East, and one African country. One vegetative compatibility group (VCG), 01213/16, is considered the major threat to bananas in tropical and subtropical climatic conditions. However, other genetically related VCGs, such as 0121, may potentially jeopardize banana cultures if they were introduced into disease-free areas. To prevent the introduction of these VCGs into disease-free Cavendish banana-growing countries, a real-time PCR test was developed to accurately detect both VCGs. A previously described putative virulence gene was used to develop a specific combination of hydrolysis probe/primers for the detection of tropical Foc race 4 strains. The real-time PCR parameters were optimized by following a statistical approach relying on orthogonal arrays and the Taguchi method in an attempt to enhance sensitivity and ensure high specificity of the assay. This study also assessed critical performance criteria, such as repeatability, reproducibility, robustness, and specificity, with a large including set of 136 F. oxysporum isolates, including 73 Foc pathogenic strains representing 24 VCGs. The validation data demonstrated that the new assay could be used for regulatory testing applications on banana plant material and can contribute to preventing the introduction and spread of Foc strains affecting Cavendish bananas in the tropics."
https://openalex.org/W2586706028,"Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) is a gut-derived peptide hormone that is produced following activation of Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR). FGF19 is secreted and signals to the liver, where it contributes to the homeostasis of bile acid (BA), lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. FGF19 is a promising therapeutic target for the metabolic syndrome and cholestatic diseases, but enthusiasm for its use has been tempered by FGF19-mediated induction of proliferation and hepatocellular carcinoma. To inform future rational design of FGF19-variants, we have conducted temporal quantitative proteomic and gene expression analyses to identify FGF19-targets related to metabolism and proliferation. Mice were fasted for 16 hours, and injected with human FGF19 (1 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle. Liver protein extracts (containing “light” lysine) were mixed 1:1 with a spike-in protein extract from 13C6-lysine metabolically labelled mouse liver (containing “heavy” lysine) and analysed by LC-MS/MS. Our analyses provide a resource of FGF19 target proteins in the liver. 189 proteins were upregulated (≥ 1.5 folds) and 73 proteins were downregulated (≤ -1.5 folds) by FGF19. FGF19 treatment decreased the expression of proteins involved in fatty acid (FA) synthesis, i.e., Fabp5, Scd1, and Acsl3 and increased the expression of Acox1, involved in FA oxidation. As expected, FGF19 increased the expression of proteins known to drive proliferation (i.e., Tgfbi, Vcam1, Anxa2 and Hdlbp). Importantly, many of the FGF19 targets (i.e., Pdk4, Apoa4, Fas and Stat3) have a dual function in both metabolism and cell proliferation. Therefore, our findings challenge the development of FGF19-variants that fully uncouple metabolic benefit from mitogenic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2587642714,"A multi-scale approach was used to evaluate which spatial gradient of environmental variability is the most important in structuring zooplankton diversity in the West Spitsbergen Current (WSC). The WSC is the main conveyor of warm and biologically rich Atlantic water to the Arctic Ocean through the Fram Strait. The data set included 85 stratified vertical zooplankton samples (obtained from depths up to 1000 metres) covering two latitudinal sections (76°30'N and 79°N) located across the multi-path WSC system. The results indicate that the most important environmental variables shaping the zooplankton structural and functional diversity and standing stock variability are those associated with depth, whereas variables acting in the horizontal dimension are of lesser importance. Multivariate analysis of the zooplankton assemblages, together with different univariate descriptors of zooplankton diversity, clearly illustrated the segregation of zooplankton taxa in the vertical plane. The epipelagic zone (upper 200 m) hosted plentiful, Oithona similis-dominated assemblages with a high proportion of filter-feeding zooplankton. Although total zooplankton abundance declined in the mesopelagic zone (200-1000 m), zooplankton assemblages in that zone were more diverse and more evenly distributed, with high contributions from both herbivorous and carnivorous taxa. The vertical distribution of integrated biomass (mg DW m-2) indicated that the total zooplankton biomass in the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones was comparable. Environmental gradients acting in the horizontal plane, such as the ones associated with different ice cover and timing of the spring bloom, were reflected in the latitudinal variability in protist community structure and probably caused differences in succession in the zooplankton community. High abundances of Calanus finmarchicus in the WSC core branch suggest the existence of mechanisms advantageous for higher productivity or/and responsible for physical concentration of zooplankton. Our results indicate that regional hydrography plays a primary role in shaping zooplankton variability in the WSC on the way to the Arctic Ocean, with additional effects caused by biological factors related to seasonality in pelagic ecosystem development, resulting in regional differences in food availability or biological production between the continental slope and the deep ocean regions."

As part of our ongoing project focused on DFO-conjugates, we synthesized, purified, characterized and studied new mtDFOs (DFO conjugated to the Mitochondria Penetrating Peptides TAT49-57, 1A, SS02 and SS20) using a succinic linker. These new conjugates retained their strong iron binding ability and antioxidant capacity. They were relatively non toxic to A2780 cells (IC50 40-100 μM) and had good mitochondrial localization (Rr +0.45 -+0.68) as observed when labeled with carboxy-tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) In general, mtDFO caused only modest levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. DFO-SS02 retained the antioxidant ability of the parent peptide, shown by the inhibition of mitochondrial superoxide formation. None of the compounds displayed cell cycle arrest or enhanced apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that mtDFO could be promising compounds for amelioration of the disease symptoms of iron overload in mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W2587197357,"This paper estimates changes in the energy return on investment (EROI) for five large petroleum fields over time using the Oil Production Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimator (OPGEE). The modeled fields include Cantarell (Mexico), Forties (U.K.), Midway-Sunset (U.S.), Prudhoe Bay (U.S.), and Wilmington (U.S.). Data on field properties and production/processing parameters were obtained from a combination of government and technical literature sources. Key areas of uncertainty include details of the oil and gas surface processing schemes. We aim to explore how long-term trends in depletion at major petroleum fields change the effective energetic productivity of petroleum extraction. Four EROI ratios are estimated for each field as follows: The net energy ratio (NER) and external energy ratio (EER) are calculated, each using two measures of energy outputs, (1) oil-only and (2) all energy outputs. In all cases, engineering estimates of inputs are used rather than expenditure-based estimates (including off-site indirect energy use and embodied energy). All fields display significant declines in NER over the modeling period driven by a combination of (1) reduced petroleum production and (2) increased energy expenditures on recovery methods such as the injection of water, steam, or gas. The fields studied had NER reductions ranging from 46% to 88% over the modeling periods (accounting for all energy outputs). The reasons for declines in EROI differ by field. Midway-Sunset experienced a 5-fold increase in steam injected per barrel of oil produced. In contrast, Prudhoe Bay has experienced nearly a 30-fold increase in amount of gas processed and reinjected per unit of oil produced. In contrast, EER estimates are subject to greater variability and uncertainty due to the relatively small magnitude of external energy investments in most cases."

Understanding the spatial and temporal levels and patterns of this lighting is a key step in determining the severity of adverse effects on different ecosystems, vegetation, and habitat types. Few such analyses have been conducted, particularly for regions with high biodiversity, including the tropics. We used an intercalibrated version of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) images of stable nighttime lights to determine what proportion of original and current Brazilian vegetation types are experiencing measurable levels of artificial light and how this has changed in recent years. The percentage area affected by both detectable light and increases in brightness ranged between 0 and 35% for native vegetation types, and between 0 and 25% for current vegetation (i.e. including agriculture). The most heavily affected areas encompassed terrestrial coastal vegetation types (restingas and mangroves), Semideciduous Seasonal Forest, and Mixed Ombrophilous Forest. The existing small remnants of Lowland Deciduous and Semideciduous Seasonal Forests and of Campinarana had the lowest exposure levels to artificial light. Light pollution has not often been investigated in developing countries but our data show that it is an environmental concern."

Experimental and epidemiological evidence point toward a protracted, clinically silent phase in prion diseases, yet there is no diagnostic test capable of identifying asymptomatic individuals incubating prions. In an effort to identify early biomarkers of prion diseases, we have compared global transcriptional profiles in brains from pre-symptomatic prion-infected mice and controls. We identified Cst7, which encodes cystatin F, as the most strongly upregulated transcript in this model. Early and robust upregulation of Cst7 mRNA levels and of its cognate protein was validated in additional mouse models of prion disease. Surprisingly, we found no significant increase in cystatin F levels in both cerebrospinal fluid or brain parenchyma of patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease compared to Alzheimer’s disease or non-demented controls. Our results validate cystatin F as a useful biomarker of early pathogenesis in experimental models of prion disease, and point to unexpected species-specific differences in the transcriptional responses to prion infections."
https://openalex.org/W2586450913,"Endoglycoceramidases (EGCases) specifically hydrolyze the glycosidic linkage between the oligosaccharide and the ceramide moieties of various glycosphingolipids, and they have received substantial attention in the emerging field of glycosphingolipidology. However, the mechanism regulating the strict substrate specificity of these GH5 glycosidases has not been identified. In this study, we report a novel EGCase I from Rhodococcus equi 103S (103S_EGCase I) with remarkably broad substrate specificity. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the enzyme may represent a new subfamily of GH5 glycosidases. The X-ray crystal structures of 103S_EGCase I alone and in complex with its substrates monosialodihexosylganglioside (GM3) and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) enabled us to identify several structural features that may account for its broad specificity. Compared with EGCase II from Rhodococcus sp. M-777 (M777_EGCase II), which possesses strict substrate specificity, 103S_EGCase I possesses a longer α7-helix and a shorter loop 4, which forms a larger substrate-binding pocket that could accommodate more extended oligosaccharides. In addition, loop 2 and loop 8 of the enzyme adopt a more open conformation, which also enlarges the oligosaccharide-binding cavity. Based on this knowledge, a rationally designed experiment was performed to examine the substrate specificity of EGCase II. The truncation of loop 4 in M777_EGCase II increased its activity toward GM1 (163%). Remarkably, the S63G mutant of M777_EGCase II showed a broader substrate spectra and significantly increased activity toward bulky substrates (up to >1370-fold for fucosyl-GM1). Collectively, the results presented here reveal the exquisite substrate recognition mechanism of EGCases and provide an opportunity for further engineering of these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2586554619,"We recently reported on the enhanced expression of two isoforms of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in human renal transplantation delayed graft function. These consist of the conventional secreted, full length MMP-2 isoform (FL-MMP-2) and a novel intracellular N-Terminal Truncated isoform (NTT-MMP-2) generated by oxidative stress-mediated activation of an alternate promoter in the MMP-2 first intron. Here we evaluated the effect of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus on the in vitro and in vivo expression of the two MMP-2 isoforms.We quantified the abundance of the FL-MMP-2 and NTT-MMP-2 transcripts by qPCR in HK2 cells cultured in high glucose or 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal (HHE) and tested the effects of the NF-κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). The streptozotocin (STZ) murine model of Type I diabetes mellitus and renal biopsies of human diabetic nephropathy were used in this study.Both isoforms of MMP-2 in HK2 cells were upregulated by culture in high glucose or with HHE. PDTC treatment did not suppress high glucose-mediated FL-MMP-2 expression but potently inhibited NTT-MMP-2 expression. With STZ-treated mice, renal cortical expression of both isoforms was increased (FL-MMP-2, 1.8-fold; NTT-MMP-2, greater than 7-fold). Isoform-specific immunohistochemical staining revealed low, but detectable levels of the FL-MMP-2 isoform in controls, while NTT-MMP-2 was not detected. While there was a modest increase in tubular epithelial cell staining for FL-MMP-2 in STZ-treated mice, NTT-MMP-2 was intensely expressed in a basolateral pattern. FL-MMP-2 and NTT-MMP-2 isoform expression as quantified by qPCR were both significantly elevated in renal biopsies of human diabetic nephropathy (12-fold and 3-fold, respectively).The expression of both isoforms of MMP-2 was enhanced in an experimental model of diabetic nephropathy and in human diabetic nephropathy. Selective MMP-2 isoform inhibition could offer a novel approach for the treatment of diabetic renal disease."

https://openalex.org/W2586320776,"The faecal indicator Escherichia coli plays a central role in water quality assessment and monitoring. It is therefore essential to understand its fate under various environmental constraints such as predation by bacterivorous zooplankton. Whereas most studies have examined how protozooplankton communities (heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates) affect the fate of E. coli in water, the capacity of metazooplankton to control the faecal indicator remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how the common filter-feeding cladoceran, Daphnia pulex, affects the fate of E. coli under different experimental conditions. Daphnia ingested E. coli and increased its loss rates in water, but the latter rates decreased from 1.65 d-1 to 0.62 d-1 after a 1,000-fold reduction in E. coli initial concentrations, due to lower probability of encounter between Daphnia and E. coli. The combined use of culture and PMA qPCR (viability-qPCR) demonstrated that exposure to Daphnia did not result into the formation of viable but non-culturable E. coli cells. In lake water, a significant part of E. coli population loss was associated with matrix-related factors, most likely due to predation by other bacterivorous biota and/or bacterial competition. However, when exposing E. coli to a D. pulex gradient (from 0 to 65 ind.L-1), we observed an increasing impact of Daphnia on E. coli loss rates, which reached 0.47 d-1 in presence of 65 ind.L-1. Our results suggest that the filter-feeder can exert a non-negligible predation pressure on E. coli, especially during seasonal Daphnia population peaks. Similar trials using other Daphnia species as well as stressed E. coli cells will increase our knowledge on the capacity of this widespread zooplankter to control E. coli in freshwater resources. Based on our results, we strongly advocate the use of natural matrices to study these biotic interactions in order to avoid overestimation of Daphnia impact."
https://openalex.org/W2587696521,"Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a group of heterogeneous abnormalities affecting the function and structure of the kidney and mostly further proceeds to cardiovascular damage prior to end stage renal disease (ESRD). The oxidative insult and inflammatory mediators have some undefined role in CKD and cardiovascular complications. It is therefore, aimed at to pin point the predictive factors in the development of cardiovascular disorder in patients with chronic kidney disease. Methods Fifty patients of CKD experiencing cardiovascular distress and twenty normal individuals having same age and sex acted as control during these observations. Blood samples (Each 5 ml) were drawn and subjected to centrifugation for 10–15 minutes to separate the serum at 4000-5000rpm. The levels of MDA, GSH, SOD, CAT, VIT C, VIT E, IL-1, TNF-alpha, nitric oxide (NO) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) were estimated and analyzed. Results The nitric oxide levels in the CKD patients decreased significantly (13.26±1.25 ng/ml) compared to controls (42.15±5.26 ng/ml). The serum vitamin E and C levels in these patients recorded 2.15±0.25 μg/ml and 0.97±0.09 μg/ml respectively as against their assigned controls which read 6.35±1.22 μg/ml and 3.29±0.25 μg/ml. Furthermore, a significantly higher level of Malondialdehyde (MDA) as1.25±0.07 nmol/ml was observed in CKD patients viz-a-viz relevant control. However, the serum SOD, catalase (CAT) and GSH levels in the same patients registered a significant decline as evident from respective figures 0.07±0.002 μg/dl, 1.22±0.012 μmol/mol, and 3.25±1.05 μg/dl. The control for these was observed as0.99±0.06 μg/dl, 3.19±0.05 μmol/mol, and 8.64±0.03 μg/dL. On the other hand, the IL-1 levels in the CKD patients found quite higher (402.5±18.26 pg/ml). This clearly points to substantial increase in oxidative insult and reduced NO levels leading to the renal and cardiovascular damage. Conclusion Observations support the fact that the decrease in anti-oxidative capacity accompanied by higher inflammatory mediators in CKD is indicative of oxidative stress, consequently leading to CKD progression, in all probability to cardiovascular insult. The outcome reiterates that strategies be designed afresh to contain CKD progression to cardiovascular complications and ESRD. One way could be to focus on early detection of stress related to the disease. It requires analyzing the factors related to stress, such as the one reported here. Linking these factors with the symptoms could be a crucial step forward. And further, the disease could be monitored in a more disciplined manner."

We analyzed XDH1 and XDH2 gene expression by real-time quantitative PCR in tissues from sugar- and blood-fed females. Differential XDH1 and XDH2 gene expression was observed in tissues dissected throughout a time course. We next exposed females to blood meals supplemented with allopurinol, a well-characterized XDH inhibitor. We also tested the effects of injecting double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) against XDH1, XDH2, or both. Disruption of XDH by allopurinol or XDH1 by RNA interference significantly affected mosquito survival, causing a disruption in blood digestion, excretion, oviposition, and reproduction. XDH1-deficient mosquitoes showed a persistence of serine proteases in the midgut at 48 h after blood feeding and a reduction in the uptake of vitellogenin by the ovaries. Surprisingly, analysis of the fat body from dsRNA-XDH1-injected mosquitoes fell into 2 groups: one group was characterized by a reduction of the XDH1 transcript, whereas the other group was characterized by an up-regulation of several transcripts, including XDH1, glutamine synthetase, alanine aminotransferase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, ornithine decarboxylase, glutamate receptor, and ammonia transporter.

First, the full-length cDNA sequence was obtained by RT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends methods. Two highly homologous cDNAs of 1491 and 1413 bp, respectively, named goat-V1 and goat-V2 were identified. Deduced protein sequences (393 and 367 amino acids, respectively) are predicted to present 11 and 9 transmembrane regions, respectively, and both contain two conserved key residues proposed to be involved in catalysis: asparagine 273 and histidine 304. RT-qPCR revealed that both forms of goat mRNAs show a similar widespread tissue distribution, with the highest expression in the gastrointestinal tract and gonads and less but considerable expression in brain, pituitary, liver and adipose tissue. Immunostaining of intestinal sections showed the presence of GOAT immunoreactive cells in the intestinal mucosa, some of which colocalize with ghrelin. Using an in vitro approach, we observed that acylated ghrelin downregulates GOAT gene and protein levels in cultured intestine in a time-dependent manner. Finally, we found a rhythmic oscillation of goat mRNA expression in the hypothalamus, pituitary and intestinal bulb of goldfish fed at midday, but not at midnight.

https://openalex.org/W2586389664,"Hyperglycemia is generally associated with oxidative stress, which plays a key role in diabetes-related complications. A complex, quantitative relationship has been established between glucose levels and oxidative stress, both in vitro and in vivo. For example, oxidative stress is known to persist after glucose normalization, a phenomenon described as metabolic memory. Also, uncontrolled glucose levels appear to be more detrimental to patients with diabetes (non-constant glucose levels) vs. patients with high, constant glucose levels. The objective of the current study was to delineate the mechanisms underlying such behaviors, using a mechanistic physiological systems modeling approach that captures and integrates essential underlying pathophysiological processes. The proposed model was based on a system of ordinary differential equations. It describes the interplay between reactive oxygen species production potential (ROS), ROS-induced cell alterations, and subsequent adaptation mechanisms. Model parameters were calibrated using different sources of experimental information, including ROS production in cell cultures exposed to various concentration profiles of constant and oscillating glucose levels. The model adequately reproduced the ROS excess generation after glucose normalization. Such behavior appeared to be driven by positive feedback regulations between ROS and ROS-induced cell alterations. The further oxidative stress-related detrimental effect as induced by unstable glucose levels can be explained by inability of cells to adapt to dynamic environment. Cell adaptation to instable high glucose declines during glucose normalization phases, and further glucose increase promotes similar or higher oxidative stress. In contrast, gradual ROS production potential decrease, driven by adaptation, is observed in cells exposed to constant high glucose."

https://openalex.org/W2586081377,"Background Small size at birth and rapid growth in early life are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in later life. Short children born small for gestational age (SGA) are treated with growth hormone (GH), inducing catch-up in length. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a marker of biological age and shorter LTL is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Objectives To investigate whether LTL is influenced by birth size, childhood growth and long-term GH treatment. Methods We analyzed LTL in 545 young adults with differences in birth size and childhood growth patterns. Previously GH-treated young adults born SGA (SGA-GH) were compared to untreated short SGA (SGA-S), SGA with spontaneous catch-up to a normal body size (SGA-CU), and appropriate for gestational age with a normal body size (AGA-NS). LTL was measured using a quantitative PCR assay. Results We found a positive association between birth length and LTL (p = 0.04), and a trend towards a positive association between birth weight and LTL (p = 0.08), after adjustments for gender, age, gestational age and adult body size. Weight gain during infancy and childhood and fat mass percentage were not associated with LTL. Female gender and gestational age were positively associated with LTL, and smoking negatively. After adjustments for gender, age and gestational age, SGA-GH had a similar LTL as SGA-S (p = 0.11), SGA-CU (p = 0.80), and AGA-NS (p = 0.30). Conclusions Larger size at birth is positively associated with LTL in young adulthood. Growth patterns during infancy and childhood are not associated with LTL. Previously GH-treated young adults born SGA have similar LTL as untreated short SGA, SGA with spontaneous catch-up and AGA born controls, indicating no adverse effects of GH-induced catch-up in height on LTL."
https://openalex.org/W2587038540,"Background A thorough analysis of continuous adventitious sounds (CAS) can provide distinct and complementary information about bronchodilator response (BDR), beyond that provided by spirometry. Nevertheless, previous approaches to CAS analysis were limited by certain methodology issues. The aim of this study is to propose a new integrated approach to CAS analysis that contributes to improving the assessment of BDR in clinical practice for asthma patients. Methods Respiratory sounds and flow were recorded in 25 subjects, including 7 asthma patients with positive BDR (BDR+), assessed by spirometry, 13 asthma patients with negative BDR (BDR-), and 5 controls. A total of 5149 acoustic components were characterized using the Hilbert spectrum, and used to train and validate a support vector machine classifier, which distinguished acoustic components corresponding to CAS from those corresponding to other sounds. Once the method was validated, BDR was assessed in all participants by CAS analysis, and compared to BDR assessed by spirometry. Results BDR+ patients had a homogenous high change in the number of CAS after bronchodilation, which agreed with the positive BDR by spirometry, indicating high reversibility of airway obstruction. Nevertheless, we also found an appreciable change in the number of CAS in many BDR- patients, revealing alterations in airway obstruction that were not detected by spirometry. We propose a categorization for the change in the number of CAS, which allowed us to stratify BDR- patients into three consistent groups. From the 13 BDR- patients, 6 had a high response, similar to BDR+ patients, 4 had a noteworthy medium response, and 1 had a low response. Conclusions In this study, a new non-invasive and integrated approach to CAS analysis is proposed as a high-sensitive tool for assessing BDR in terms of acoustic parameters which, together with spirometry parameters, contribute to improving the stratification of BDR levels in patients with obstructive pulmonary diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2587659443,"In Germany, orthopedic workforce planning relies on population-to-provider-ratios represented by the 'official degree of care provision'. However, with geographic information systems (GIS), more sophisticated measurements are available. By utilizing GIS-based technologies we analyzed the current state of demand and supply of the orthopedic workforce in Germany (orthopedic accessibility) with the integrated Floating Catchment Area method. The analysis of n = 153,352,220 distances revealed significant geographical variations on national scale: 5,617,595 people (6.9% of total population) lived in an area with significant low orthopedic accessibility (average z-score = -4.0), whereas 31,748,161 people (39.0% of total population) lived in an area with significant high orthopedic accessibility (average z-score = 8.0). Accessibility was positively correlated with the degree of urbanization (r = 0.49; p<0.001) and the official degree of care provision (r = 0.33; p<0.001) and negatively correlated with regional social deprivation (r = -0.47; p<0.001). Despite advantages of simpler measures regarding implementation and acceptance in health policy, more sophisticated measures of accessibility have the potential to reduce costs as well as improve health care. With this study, significant geographical variations were revealed that show the need to reduce oversupply in less deprived urban areas in order to enable adequate care in more deprived rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W2586917562,"Glutamate-activated α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPA-Rs) mediate the majority of excitatory neurotransmission in brain and thus are major drug targets for diseases associated with hyperexcitability or neurotoxicity. Due to the critical nature of AMPA-Rs in normal brain function, typical AMPA-R antagonists have deleterious effects on cognition and motor function, highlighting the need for more precise modulators. A dramatic increase in the flip isoform of alternatively spliced AMPA-R GluA1 subunits occurs post-seizure in humans and animal models. GluA1-flip produces higher gain AMPA channels than GluA1-flop, increasing network excitability and seizure susceptibility. Splice modulating oligonucleotides (SMOs) bind to pre-mRNA to influence alternative splicing, a strategy that can be exploited to develop more selective drugs across therapeutic areas. We developed a novel SMO, GR1, which potently and specifically decreased GluA1-flip expression throughout the brain of neonatal mice lasting at least 60 days after single intracerebroventricular injection. GR1 treatment reduced AMPA-R mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents at hippocampal CA1 synapses, without affecting long-term potentiation or long-term depression, cellular models of memory, or impairing GluA1-dependent cognition or motor function in mice. Importantly, GR1 demonstrated anti-seizure properties and reduced post-seizure hyperexcitability in neonatal mice, highlighting its drug candidate potential for treating epilepsies and other neurological diseases involving network hyperexcitability."
https://openalex.org/W2587539289,"This study presents an analysis of the small molecule bioactivity profiles across large quantities of diverse protein families represented in PubChem BioAssay. We compared the bioactivity profiles of FDA approved drugs to non-FDA approved compounds, and report several distinct patterns characteristic of the approved drugs. We found that a large fraction of the previously reported higher target promiscuity among FDA approved compounds, compared to non-FDA approved bioactives, was frequently due to cross-reactivity within rather than across protein families. We identified 804 potentially novel protein target candidates for FDA approved drugs, as well as 901 potentially novel target candidates with active non-FDA approved compounds, but no FDA approved drugs with activity against these targets. We also identified 486348 potentially novel compounds active against the same targets as FDA approved drugs, as well as 153402 potentially novel compounds active against targets without active FDA approved drugs. By quantifying the agreement among replicated screens, we estimated that more than half of these novel outcomes are reproducible. Using biclustering, we identified many dense clusters of FDA approved drugs with enriched activity against a common set of protein targets. We also report the distribution of compound promiscuity using a Bayesian statistical model, and report the sensitivity and specificity of two common methods for identifying promiscuous compounds. Aggregator assays exhibited greater accuracy in identifying highly promiscuous compounds, while PAINS substructures were able to identify a much larger set of “middle range” promiscuous compounds. Additionally, we report a large number of promiscuous compounds not identified as aggregators or PAINS. In summary, the results of this study represent a rich reference for selecting novel drug and target protein candidates, as well as for eliminating candidate compounds with unselective activities."
https://openalex.org/W2587311552,"New synapses are constantly being generated and lost in the living brain with only a subset of these being stabilized to form an enduring component of neuronal circuitry. The properties of synaptic transmission have primarily been established in a variety of in vitro neuronal preparations. It is not clear, however, if newly-formed and persistent synapses contribute to the results of these studies consistently throughout the lifespan of these preparations. In neonatal somatosensory, barrel, cortex we have previously hypothesized that a population of thalamocortical synapses displaying unusually slow kinetics represent newly-formed, default-transient synapses. This clear phenotype would provide an ideal tool to investigate if such newly formed synapses consistently contribute to synaptic transmission throughout a normal experimental protocol. We show that the proportion of synapses recorded in vitro displaying slow kinetics decreases with time after brain slice preparation. However, slow synapses persist in vitro in the presence of either minocycline, an inhibitor of microglia-mediated synapse elimination, or the TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone a promoter of synapse formation. These findings show that the observed properties of synaptic transmission may systematically change with time in vitro in a standard brain slice preparation."

https://openalex.org/W2586064650,"The persistence of atmospheric circulation anomalies over East Asia shows a winter to winter recurrence (WTWR) phenomenon. Seasonal variations in sea level pressure anomalies and surface wind anomalies display significantly different characteristics between WTWR and non-WTWR years. The WTWR years are characterized by the recurrence of both a strong (weak) anomalous Siberian High and an East Asian winter monsoon over two successive winters without persistence through the intervening summer. However, anomalies during the non-WTWR years have the opposite sign between the current and ensuing winters. The WTWR of circulation anomalies contributes to that of surface air temperature anomalies (SATAs), which is useful information for improving seasonal and interannual climate predictions over East Asia and China. In the positive (negative) WTWR years, SATAs are cooler (warmer) over East Asia in two successive winters, but the signs of the SATAs are opposite in the preceding and subsequent winters during the non-WTWR years."
