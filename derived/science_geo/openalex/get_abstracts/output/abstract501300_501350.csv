https://openalex.org/W2041250499,"Structures of the infectious form of prion protein (e.g. PrPSc or PrP-Scrapie) remain poorly defined. The prevalent structural models of PrPSc retain most of the native α-helices of the normal, noninfectious prion protein, cellular prion protein (PrPC), but evidence is accumulating that these helices are absent in PrPSc amyloid. Moreover, recombinant PrPC can form amyloid fibrils in vitro that have parallel in-register intermolecular β-sheet architectures in the domains originally occupied by helices 2 and 3. Here, we provide solid-state NMR evidence that the latter is also true of initially prion-seeded recombinant PrP amyloids formed in the absence of denaturants. These results, in the context of a primarily β-sheet structure, led us to build detailed models of PrP amyloid based on parallel in-register architectures, fibrillar shapes and dimensions, and other available experimentally derived conformational constraints. Molecular dynamics simulations of PrP(90–231) octameric segments suggested that such linear fibrils, which are consistent with many features of PrPSc fibrils, can have stable parallel in-register β-sheet cores. These simulations revealed that the C-terminal residues ∼124–227 more readily adopt stable tightly packed structures than the N-terminal residues ∼90–123 in the absence of cofactors. Variations in the placement of turns and loops that link the β-sheets could give rise to distinct prion strains capable of faithful template-driven propagation. Moreover, our modeling suggests that single PrP monomers can comprise the entire cross-section of fibrils that have previously been assumed to be pairs of laterally associated protofilaments. Together, these insights provide a new basis for deciphering mammalian prion structures. Structures of the infectious form of prion protein (e.g. PrPSc or PrP-Scrapie) remain poorly defined.

https://openalex.org/W2044432453,"By 2015, there will be an estimated two billion smartphone users worldwide. This technology presents exciting opportunities for cognitive science as a medium for rapid, large-scale experimentation and data collection. At present, cost and logistics limit most study populations to small samples, restricting the experimental questions that can be addressed. In this study we investigated whether the mass collection of experimental data using smartphone technology is valid, given the variability of data collection outside of a laboratory setting. We presented four classic experimental paradigms as short games, available as a free app and over the first month 20,800 users submitted data. We found that the large sample size vastly outweighed the noise inherent in collecting data outside a controlled laboratory setting, and show that for all four games canonical results were reproduced. For the first time, we provide experimental validation for the use of smartphones for data collection in cognitive science, which can lead to the collection of richer data sets and a significant cost reduction as well as provide an opportunity for efficient phenotypic screening of large populations."
https://openalex.org/W2031499498,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli are resistant to wide range of antibiotics rendering the treatment of infections very difficult. A main mechanism attributed to the resistance is the function of efflux pumps. MexAB-OprM and AcrAB-TolC are the tripartite efflux pump assemblies, responsible for multidrug resistance in P. aeruginosa and E. coli respectively. Substrates that are more susceptible for efflux are predicted to have a common pharmacophore feature map. In this study, a new criterion of excluding compounds with efflux substrate-like features was used, thereby refining the selection process and enriching the inhibitor identification process. An in-house database of phytochemicals was created and screened using high-throughput virtual screening against AcrB and MexB proteins and filtered by matching with the common pharmacophore models (AADHR, ADHNR, AAHNR, AADHN, AADNR, AAADN, AAADR, AAANR, AAAHN, AAADD and AAADH) generated using known efflux substrates. Phytochemical hits that matched with any one or more of the efflux substrate models were excluded from the study. Hits that do not have features similar to the efflux substrate models were docked using XP docking against the AcrB and MexB proteins. The best hits of the XP docking were validated by checkerboard synergy assay and ethidium bromide accumulation assay for their efflux inhibition potency. Lanatoside C and diadzein were filtered based on the synergistic potential and validated for their efflux inhibition potency using ethidium bromide accumulation study. These compounds exhibited the ability to increase the accumulation of ethidium bromide inside the bacterial cell as evidenced by these increase in fluorescence in the presence of the compounds. With this good correlation between in silico screening and positive efflux inhibitory activity in vitro, the two compounds, lanatoside C and diadzein could be promising efflux pump inhibitors and effective to use in combination therapy against drug resistant strains of P. aeruginosa and E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2058404113,"The cross-talk between beta cells and endothelium plays a key role in islet physiopathology and in the revascularization process after islet transplantation. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this cross-talk are not fully elucidated. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted membrane nanoparticles involved in inter-cellular communication through the transfer of proteins and nucleic acids. The aims of this study were: 1) isolation and characterization of EVs from human islets; 2) evaluation of the pro-angiogenic effect of islet-derived EVs on human islet endothelial cells (IECs). EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation from conditioned medium of human islets and characterized by nanotrack analysis (Nanosight), FACS, western blot, bioanalyzer, mRNA/microRNA RT-PCR array. On IECs, we evaluated EV-induced insulin mRNA transfer, proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, in vitro angiogenesis, migration, gene and protein profiling. EVs sized 236±54 nm, expressed different surface molecules and islet-specific proteins (insulin, C-peptide, GLP1R) and carried several mRNAs (VEGFa, eNOS) and microRNAs (miR-27b, miR-126, miR-130 and miR-296) involved in beta cell function, insulin secretion and angiogenesis. Purified EVs were internalized into IECs inducing insulin mRNA expression, protection from apoptosis and enhancement of angiogenesis. Human islets release biologically active EVs able to shuttle specific mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) into target endothelial cells. These results suggest a putative role for islet-derived EVs in beta cell-endothelium cross-talk and in the neoangiogenesis process which is critical for engraftment of transplanted islets."
https://openalex.org/W2066000496,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by two neuropathological hallmarks: senile plaques, which are composed of Aβ peptides, and neurofibrillary tangles, which are composed of hyperphosphorylated TAU protein. Diabetic patients with dysregulated insulin signalling are at increased risk of developing AD. Further, several animal models of diabetes show increased Aβ expression and hyperphosphorylated tau. As we have shown recently, the anti-diabetic drug metformin is capable of dephosphorylating tau at AD-relevant phospho-sites. Here, we investigated the effect of metformin on the main amyloidogenic enzyme BACE1 and, thus, on the production of Aβ peptides, the second pathological hallmark of AD. We find similar results in cultures of primary neurons, a human cell line model of AD and in vivo in mice. We show that treatment with metformin decreases BACE1 protein expression by interfering with an mRNA-protein complex that contains the ubiquitin ligase MID1, thereby reducing BACE1 activity. Together with our previous findings these results indicate that metformin may target both pathological hallmarks of AD and may be of therapeutic value for treating and/or preventing AD."
https://openalex.org/W2154656849,"Indian hedgehog (Ihh) is essential for chondrocyte differentiation and endochondral ossification and acts with parathyroid hormone-related peptide in a negative feedback loop to regulate early chondrocyte differentiation and entry to hypertrophic differentiation. Independent of this function, we and others recently reported independent Ihh functions to promote chondrocyte hypertrophy and matrix mineralization in vivo and in vitro. However, the molecular mechanisms for these actions and their functional significance are still unknown. We recently discovered that Ihh overexpression in chondrocytes stimulated the expression of late chondrocyte differentiation markers and induced matrix mineralization. Focusing on collagen type X (Col10α1) expression and transcription, we observed that hedgehog downstream transcription factors GLI-Krüppel family members (Gli) 1/2 increased COL10A1 promoter activity and identified a novel Gli1/2 response element in the 250-bp basic promoter. In addition, we found that Ihh induced Runx2 expression in chondrocytes without up-regulating other modulators of chondrocyte maturation such as Mef2c, Foxa2, and Foxa3. Runx2 promoted Col10α1 expression in cooperation with Ihh. Further analyses using promoter assays, immunofluorescence, and binding assays showed the interaction of Gli1/2 in a complex with Runx2/Smads induces chondrocyte differentiation. Finally, we could demonstrate that Ihh promotes in vitro matrix mineralization using similar molecular mechanisms. Our data provide an in vitro mechanism for Ihh signaling to positively regulate Col10α1 transcription. Thus, Ihh signaling could be an important player for not only early chondrocyte differentiation but maturation and calcification of chondrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1981058570,"The three isoforms of antigen 85 (A, B, and C) are the most abundant secreted mycobacterial proteins and catalyze transesterification reactions that synthesize mycolated arabinogalactan, trehalose monomycolate (TMM), and trehalose dimycolate (TDM), important constituents of the outermost layer of the cellular envelope of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These three enzymes are nearly identical at the active site and have therefore been postulated to exist to evade host immunity. Distal to the active site is a second putative carbohydrate-binding site of lower homology. Mutagenesis of the three isoforms at this second site affected both substrate selectivity and overall catalytic activity in vitro. Using synthetic and natural substrates, we show that these three enzymes exhibit unique selectivity; antigen 85A more efficiently mycolates TMM to form TDM, whereas C (and to a lesser extent B) has a higher rate of activity using free trehalose to form TMM. This difference in substrate selectivity extends to the hexasaccharide fragment of cell wall arabinan. Mutation of secondary site residues from the most active isoform (C) into those present in A or B partially interconverts this substrate selectivity. These experiments in combination with molecular dynamics simulations reveal that differences in the N-terminal helix α9, the adjacent Pro(216)-Phe(228) loop, and helix α5 are the likely cause of changes in activity and substrate selectivity. These differences explain the existence of three isoforms and will allow for future work in developing inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2062277779,"Tea flavonoids bind to variety of enzymes and inhibit their activities. In the present study, binding and inhibition of catalase activity by catechins with respect to their structure-affinity relationship has been elucidated. Fluorimetrically determined binding constants for (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and (−)-epicatechin gallate (ECG) with catalase were observed to be 2.27×106 M−1 and 1.66×106 M−1, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters evidence exothermic and spontaneous interaction between catechins and catalase. Major forces of interaction are suggested to be through hydrogen bonding along with electrostatic contributions and conformational changes. Distinct loss of α-helical structure of catalase by interaction with EGCG was captured in circular dichroism (CD) spectra. Gallated catechins demonstrated higher binding constants and inhibition efficacy than non-gallated catechins. EGCG exhibited maximum inhibition of pure catalase. It also inhibited cellular catalase in K562 cancer cells with significant increase in cellular ROS and suppression of cell viability (IC50 54.5 µM). These results decipher the molecular mechanism by which tea catechins interact with catalase and highlight the potential of gallated catechin like EGCG as an anticancer drug. EGCG may have other non-specific targets in the cell, but its anticancer property is mainly defined by ROS accumulation due to catalase inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2029835081,"Inactivating mutations of the gene encoding the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) have been linked to an aggressive variant of hereditary kidney cancer (hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer). These tumors accumulate markedly elevated levels of fumarate. Fumarate is among a growing list of oncometabolites identified in cancers with mutations of genes involved in intermediary metabolism. FH-deficient tumors are notable for their pronounced accumulation of the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and aggressive behavior. To date, HIF-1α accumulation in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer tumors is thought to result from fumarate-dependent inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases and subsequent evasion from von Hippel-Lindau-dependent degradation. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which fumarate promotes HIF-1α mRNA and protein accumulation independent of the von Hippel-Lindau pathway. Here we demonstrate that fumarate promotes p65 phosphorylation and p65 accumulation at the HIF-1α promoter through non-canonical signaling via the upstream Tank binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Consistent with these data, inhibition of the TBK1/p65 axis blocks HIF-1α accumulation in cellular models of FH loss and markedly reduces cell invasion of FH-deficient RCC cancer cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which pseudohypoxia is promoted in FH-deficient tumors and identifies TBK1 as a novel putative therapeutic target for the treatment of aggressive fumarate-driven tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2016598788,"TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a key kinase in mediating Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling. Although TAK1 activation involves the phosphorylation of Thr-184 and Thr-187 residues at the activation loop, the molecular mechanism underlying the complete activation of TAK1 remains elusive. In this work, we show that the Thr-187 phosphorylation of TAK1 is regulated by its C-terminal coiled-coil domain-mediated dimerization in an autophosphorylation manner. Importantly, we find that TAK1 activation in mediating downstream signaling requires an additional phosphorylation at Ser-412, which is critical for TAK1 response to proinflammatory stimuli, such as TNF-α, LPS, and IL-1β. In vitro kinase and shRNA-based knockdown assays reveal that TAK1 Ser-412 phosphorylation is regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit α (PKACα) and X-linked protein kinase (PRKX), which is essential for proper signaling and proinflammatory cytokine induction by TLR/IL-1R activation. Morpholino-based in vivo knockdown and rescue studies show that the corresponding site Ser-391 in zebrafish TAK1 plays a conserved role in NF-κB activation. Collectively, our data unravel a previously unknown mechanism involving TAK1 phosphorylation mediated by PKACα and PRKX that contributes to innate immune signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2065649131,"The most significant vector of tick-borne pathogens in the United States is Ixodes scapularis Say (the blacklegged tick). Previous studies have identified significant genetic, behavioral and morphological differences between northern vs. southern populations of this tick. Because tick-borne pathogens are dependent on their vectors for transmission, a baseline understanding of the vector population structure is crucial to determining the risks and epidemiology of pathogen transmission.We investigated population genetic variation of I. scapularis populations in the eastern United States using a multilocus approach. We sequenced and analyzed the mitochondrial COI and 16S genes and three nuclear genes (serpin2, ixoderin B and lysozyme) from wild specimens.We identified a deep divergence (3-7%) in I. scapularis COI gene sequences from some southern specimens, suggesting we had sampled a different Ixodes species. Analysis of mitochondrial 16S rRNA sequences did not support this hypothesis and indicated that all specimens were I. scapularis. Phylogenetic analysis and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) supported significant differences between northern vs. southern populations. Demographic analysis suggested that northern populations had experienced a bottleneck/expansion event sometime in the past, possibly associated with Pleistocene glaciation events.Similar to other studies, our data support the division of northern vs. southern I. scapularis genetic lineages, likely due to differences in the demographic histories between these geographic regions. The deep divergence identified in some COI gene sequences highlights a potential hazard of relying solely on COI for species identification (""barcoding"") and population genetics in this important vector arthropod."

Identifying the location, pattern and extent of Cre recombination in vivo is an important aspect of this technology. Here we report pigs with a dual fluorochrome cassette under the control of the strong CAG promoter that switches expression after Cre-recombination, from membrane-targeted tandem dimer Tomato to membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein. The reporter cassette was placed at the porcine ROSA26 locus by conventional gene targeting using primary mesenchymal stem cells, and animals generated by nuclear transfer. Gene targeting efficiency was high, and analysis of foetal organs and primary cells indicated that the reporter is highly expressed and functional. Cre reporter pigs will provide a multipurpose indicator of Cre recombinase activity, an important new tool for the rapidly expanding field of porcine genetic modification."
https://openalex.org/W2098542384,"Objective The immune response to post-translationally modified antigens is a key characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis. Carbamylation is such a posttranslational modification. Recently, we demonstrated that autoantibodies recognizing carbamylated proteins are present in sera of rheumatoid arthritis. The molecular mechanisms underlying the break of tolerance and hence the induction of anti-CarP antibody responses are unknown as well as their appearance in mouse models for systemic arthritis. Therefore we analyzed their appearance in the mouse collagen-induced arthritis model. Methods collagen induced arthritis was induced by immunization with type II collagen in complete Freund's adjuvant. Arthritis severity was monitored by clinical scoring and anti-CarP antibody levels were determined by ELISA. Results Anti-CarP antibodies were detectable in mice with collagen induced arthritis. We did not detect ACPA in mice with collagen induced arthritis. The specificity of the antibodies for carbamylated proteins was confirmed by inhibition assays and immunoblotting. Injection with complete Freund's adjuvant without type II collagen could also induce anti-CarP antibodies, however, in mice with arthritis, the anti-CarP antibody response was stronger and developed more rapidly. The onset of collagen induced arthritis was preceded by an increase of anti-CarP IgG2a levels in the serum. Conclusion In mice with collagen induced arthritis we did not observe an immune response against citrullinated antigens, but we did observe an immune response against carbamylated antigens. This anti-CarP response already appeared before disease onset, indicating that collagen induced arthritis can be used as an in vivo model to study anti-CarP antibodies. Our data also indicate that the tolerance to carbamylated proteins, in contrast to the response to citrullinated proteins, is easily broken and that arthritis boosts the immune response against these proteins. The anti-CarP response in mice with CIA can be used as a model for immune responses to post-translationally modified proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2052585938,"The rise of multidrug-resistant and totally drug-resistant tuberculosis and the association with an increasing number of HIV-positive patients developing tuberculosis emphasize the necessity to find new antitubercular targets and drugs. The antigen 85 (Ag85) complex from Mycobacterium tuberculosis plays important roles in the biosynthesis of major components of the mycobacterial cell envelope. For this reason, Ag85 has emerged as an attractive drug target. Recently, ebselen was identified as an effective inhibitor of the Ag85 complex through covalent modification of a cysteine residue proximal to the Ag85 active site and is therefore a covalent, allosteric inhibitor. To expand the understanding of this process, we have solved the x-ray crystal structures of Ag85C covalently modified with ebselen and other thiol-reactive compounds, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and iodoacetamide, as well as the structure of a cysteine to glycine mutant. All four structures confirm that chemical modification or mutation at this particular cysteine residue leads to the disruption of the active site hydrogen-bonded network essential for Ag85 catalysis. We also describe x-ray crystal structures of Ag85C single mutants within the catalytic triad and show that a mutation of any one of these three residues promotes the same conformational change observed in the cysteine-modified forms. These results provide evidence for active site dynamics that may afford new strategies for the development of selective and potent Ag85 inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2053387888,"In immune-mediated control of pathogens, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I presents various antigenic peptides to CD8(+) T-cells. Long-lived peptide presentation is important for efficient antigen-specific T-cell activation. Presentation time depends on the peptide sequence and the stability of the peptide-HLA complex (pHLA). However, the determinant of peptide-dependent pHLA stability remains elusive. Here, to reveal the pHLA stabilization mechanism, we examined the crystal structures of an HLA class I allomorph in complex with HIV-derived peptides and evaluated site-specific conformational fluctuations using NMR. Although the crystal structures of various pHLAs were almost identical independent of the peptides, fluctuation analyses identified a peptide-dependent minor state that would be more tightly packed toward the peptide. The minor population correlated well with the thermostability and cell surface presentation of pHLA, indicating that this newly identified minor state is important for stabilizing the pHLA and facilitating T-cell recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2064960088,"Background For decades, lactate has been considered an excellent biomarker for oxygen limitation and therefore of organ ischemia. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the frequency of increased brain lactate levels and the LP ratio (LPR) in a cohort of patients with severe or moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) subjected to brain microdialysis monitoring to analyze the agreement between these two biomarkers and to indicate brain energy metabolism dysfunction. Methods Forty-six patients with an admission Glasgow coma scale score of ≤13 after resuscitation admitted to a dedicated 10-bed Neurotraumatology Intensive Care Unit were included, and 5305 verified samples of good microdialysis data were analyzed. Results Lactate levels were above 2.5 mmol/L in 56.9% of the samples. The relationships between lactate and the LPR could not be adequately modeled by any linear or non-linear model. Neither Cohen’s kappa nor Gwet’s statistic showed an acceptable agreement between both biomarkers to classify the samples in regard to normal or abnormal metabolism. The dataset was divided into four patterns defined by the lactate concentrations and the LPR. A potential interpretation for these patterns is suggested and discussed. Pattern 4 (low pyruvate levels) was found in 10.7% of the samples and was characterized by a significantly low concentration of brain glucose compared with the other groups. Conclusions Our study shows that metabolic abnormalities are frequent in the macroscopically normal brain in patients with traumatic brain injuries and a very poor agreement between lactate and the LPR when classifying metabolism. The concentration of lactate in the dialysates must be interpreted while taking into consideration the LPR to distinguish between anaerobic metabolism and aerobic hyperglycolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2069658268,"The present anti-infection strategy for prosthetic joint infections (PJI) includes the use of antibiotics and surgical treatments, but the bacterial eradication rates are still low. One of the major challenges is the formation of biofilm causing poor bacterial eradication. Recently it has been reported that allicin (diallyl thiosulphinate), an antibacterial principle of garlic, can inhibit bacteria adherence and prevent biofilm formation in vitro. However, whether allicin could inhibit biofilm formation in vivo is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of allicin on biofilm formation, and whether allicin could potentiate the bactericidal effect of vancomycin in a rabbit PJI model.A sterile stainless-steel screw with a sterile ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene washer was inserted into the lateral femoral condyle of the right hind knee joint of rabbit, and 1 mL inoculum containing 104 colony-forming units of Staphylococcus epidermidis was inoculated into the knee joint (n = 32). Fourteen days later, rabbits randomly received one of the following 4 treatments using continuous lavages: normal saline, vancomycin (20 mcg/mL), allicin (4 mg/L), or allicin (4 mg/L) plus vancomycin (20 mcg/mL). Three days later, the washer surface biofilm formation was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The bacterial counts within the biofilm of implanted screws were determined by bacterial culture.The lowest number of viable bacterial counts of Staphylococcus epidermidis recovered from the biofilm was in the rabbits treated with allicin plus vancomycin (P<0.01 vs. all other groups). The biofilm formation was significantly reduced or undetectable by SEM in rabbits receiving allicin or allicin plus vancomycin.Intra-articular allicincan inhibit biofilm formation and enhance the bactericidal effect of vancomycin on implant surface in vivo. Allicin in combination with vancomycin may be a useful anti-infection strategy for the treatment of PJI."
https://openalex.org/W2116219871,"Studies have shown that the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), a vulnerable large filter feeder, seasonally aggregates at highly productive coastal sites and that individuals can perform large, trans-boundary migrations to reach these locations. Yet, the whereabouts of the whale shark when absent from these sites and the potential oceanographic and biological drivers involved in shaping their present and future habitat use, including that located at the fringes of their suitable oceanic habitat, are largely unknown. We analysed a 16-year (1998-2013) observer dataset from the pole-and-line tuna fishery across the Azores (mid-North Atlantic) and used GAM models to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of whale shark occurrence in relation to oceanographic features. Across this period, the whale shark became a regular summer visitor to the archipelago after a sharp increase in sighting frequency seen in 2008. We found that SST helps predicting their occurrence in the region associated to the position of the seasonal 22°C isotherm, showing that the Azores are at a thermal boundary for this species and providing an explanation for the post 2007 increase. Within the region, whale shark detections were also higher in areas of increased bathymetric slope and closer to the seamounts, coinciding with higher chl-a biomass, a behaviour most probably associated to increased feeding opportunities. They also showed a tendency to be clustered around the southernmost island of Santa Maria. This study shows that the region integrates the oceanic habitat of adult whale shark and suggests that an increase in its relative importance for the Atlantic population might be expected in face of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2001451636,"Background Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma (UPS) and high-grade Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) are soft tissue tumors with an aggressive clinical behavior, frequently developing local recurrence and distant metastases. Despite several gene expression studies involving soft tissue sarcomas, the potential to identify molecular markers has been limited, mostly due to small sample size, in-group heterogeneity and absence of detailed clinical data. Materials and Methods Gene expression profiling was performed for 22 LMS and 22 UPS obtained from untreated patients. To assess the relevance of the gene signature, a meta-analysis was performed using five published studies. Four genes (BAD, MYOCD, SRF and SRC) selected from the gene signature, meta-analysis and functional in silico analysis were further validated by quantitative PCR. In addition, protein-protein interaction analysis was applied to validate the data. SRC protein immunolabeling was assessed in 38 UPS and 52 LMS. Results We identified 587 differentially expressed genes between LMS and UPS, of which 193 corroborated with other studies. Cluster analysis of the data failed to discriminate LMS from UPS, although it did reveal a distinct molecular profile for retroperitoneal LMS, which was characterized by the over-expression of smooth muscle-specific genes. Significantly higher levels of expression for BAD, SRC, SRF, and MYOCD were confirmed in LMS when compared with UPS. SRC was the most value discriminator to distinguish both sarcomas and presented the highest number of interaction in the in silico protein-protein analysis. SRC protein labeling showed high specificity and a positive predictive value therefore making it a candidate for use as a diagnostic marker in LMS. Conclusions Retroperitoneal LMS presented a unique gene signature. SRC is a putative diagnostic marker to differentiate LMS from UPS."
https://openalex.org/W2082520801,"Protein neddylation is involved in a wide variety of cellular processes. Here we show that the DNA damage response is perturbed in cells inactivated with an E2 Nedd8 conjugating enzyme UBE2M, measured by RAD51 foci formation kinetics and cell based DNA repair assays. UBE2M knockdown increases DNA breakages and cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, further suggesting heightened genomic instability and defective DNA repair activity. Investigating the downstream Cullin targets of UBE2M revealed that silencing of Cullin 1, 2, and 4 ligases incurred significant DNA damage. In particular, UBE2M knockdown, or defective neddylation of Cullin 2, leads to a blockade in the G1 to S progression and is associated with delayed S-phase dependent DNA damage response. Cullin 4 inactivation leads to an aberrantly high DNA damage response that is associated with increased DNA breakages and sensitivity of cells to DNA damaging agents, suggesting a DNA repair defect is associated. siRNA interrogation of key Cullin substrates show that CDT1, p21, and Claspin are involved in elevated DNA damage in the UBE2M knockdown cells. Therefore, UBE2M is required to maintain genome integrity by activating multiple Cullin ligases throughout the cell cycle."

In human HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma, the early growth response 1 (EGR1) gene was induced by either AA deprivation or endoplasmic reticulum stress. AAR-dependent EGR1 activation was discovered to be independent of the well characterized GCN2-ATF4 pathway and instead dependent on MEK-ERK signaling, one of the MAPK pathways. ChIP showed that constitutively bound ELK1 at the EGR1 proximal promoter region was phosphorylated after AAR activation. Increased p-ELK1 binding was associated with increased de novo recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the EGR1 promoter. EGR1 transcription was not induced in HEK293T cells lacking endogenous MEK activity, but overexpression of exogenous constitutively active MEK in HEK293T cells resulted in increased basal and AAR-induced EGR1 expression. ChIP analysis of the human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) gene, a known EGR1-responsive gene, revealed moderate increases in AAR-induced EGR1 binding within the proximal promoter and highly inducible binding to a site within the first intron. Collectively, these data document a novel AA-activated MEK-ERK-ELK1 signaling mechanism. Amino acid (AA) limitation in mammalian cells triggers a collection of signaling cascades jointly referred to as the AA response (AAR). In human HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma, the early growth response 1 (EGR1) gene was induced by either AA deprivation or endoplasmic reticulum stress. AAR-dependent EGR1 activation was discovered to be independent of the well characterized GCN2-ATF4 pathway and instead dependent on MEK-ERK signaling, one of the MAPK pathways. ChIP showed that constitutively bound ELK1 at the EGR1 proximal promoter region was phosphorylated after AAR activation. Increased p-ELK1 binding was associated with increased de novo recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the EGR1 promoter.

The best characterized among these networks involves activation of the general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase, which senses increased intracellular uncharged tRNA levels. Once activated, GCN2 phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF2α), triggering a global suppression of protein translation initiation, but an increase in the translation of selected mRNAs including that for activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (3.Vattem K.M.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress also triggers ATF4 synthesis through activation of a separate eIF2 kinase called PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) (4.Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D.

Interestingly, the list of genes induced during the AAR in HepG2 cells included several immediate-early response genes such as selected members of the FOS-JUN and the early growth response (EGR) transcription factor families (10.Shan J.

Follow-up studies established that cJUN is a novel AAR-inducible gene, for which the induction is ATF4-independent, and instead involves autoactivation in response to signaling from the JNK arm of MAPK signaling (12.Fu L.

EGR1, which encodes a zinc finger transcription factor, is an important immediate-early response gene activated by a broad range of extracellular stimuli. EGR1 impacts cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 14.Pagel J.I. Deindl E. Early growth response 1: a transcription factor in the crossfire of signal transduction cascades.Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 2011; 48: 226-235PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling pathways that control EGR1 transcription vary depending on the initial stimulus and target tissue, but many studies have established that phosphorylation of constitutively bound E twenty-six-like factor (ELK1) in response to MEK-ERK signaling is an important mechanism (14.Pagel J.I.

ELK1 belongs to the ternary complex factor subfamily of the ETS (E twenty-six) superfamily of transcription factors (16.Hollenhorst P.C. McIntosh L.P. Graves B.J.

ELK1 uses different DNA binding modes to regulate functionally distinct classes of target genes.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002694Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Once increased in its expression, EGR1 regulates the transcription of target genes by binding to GC-rich sequences (14.Pagel J.I. Deindl E.

Biol. 1990; 10: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Egr1 knock-out mice, though viable, exhibit impaired liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy, and Egr1 has been proposed as a central regulator of cell cycle progression during hepatocellular regeneration following injury (19.Liao Y. Shikapwashya O.N. Shteyer E. Dieckgraefe B.K. Hruz P.W. Rudnick D.A. Delayed hepatocellular mitotic progression and impaired liver regeneration in early growth response-1-deficient mice.J. Biol.

Thus, control of hepatic EGR1 expression by AA limitation or ER stress may be a critical factor in liver physiology. The present study documents that the AAR-initiated induction of EGR1 transcription is not mediated by the well documented GCN2-eIF2-ATF4 signaling pathway, but instead by AA-responsive MEK-ERK signaling. ERK-dependent phosphorylation of ELK1, constitutively bound to the EGR1 gene is associated with increased transcription and a marked elevation of EGR1 expression. Therefore, these results provide evidence for the existence of an AA-controlled MEK signaling pathway that terminates with phosphorylation of ELK1. The AA-dependent transcription via p-ELK1 reveals a new family of transcription factors, the ETS family, within the AAR. Correspondingly, transcription is induced through ETS genomic enhancer sequences previously unknown to have AAR element activity. Furthermore, the induction of immediate-early response genes in AA-deprived tumor cells provides a possible link between protein/AA nutrition and cell growth in the transformed state. All of the cell lines used in these studies were cultured in DMEM (pH 7.4; Mediatech, Herndon, VA), supplemented with 1× nonessential AA, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The HEK293T-ATF4 cell line was created by Ord et al. (20.Ord D. Meerits K. Ord T. TRB3 protects cells against the growth inhibitory and cytotoxic effect of ATF4.Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3556-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) after virally transforming HEK293T cells with a tetracycline (Tet)-inducible construct that contains the ATF4 coding region. The HEK293T-ATF4 DMEM was the same as above but was also supplemented with 10% (v/v) tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum, 25 μg/ml Zeocin, and 2.5 μg/ml blasticidin. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air and maintained in growth phase at 60–70% confluence. Approximately 12 h prior to treatments, cells were replenished with fresh DMEM to ensure more complete nutrition when experiments were initiated. For the HEK293T-ATF4 cells, overexpression of ATF4 in the absence of other possible AAR signals was induced by adding tetracycline at the concentrations and times indicated. For activation of the AAR, cells were incubated in either DMEM lacking histidine (catalog number D9801-02; United States Biological, Swampscott, MA) or complete DMEM containing 2 mm histidinol (HisOH), an amino alcohol that triggers the AAR. HisOH competitively inhibits histidinyl tRNA synthetase, causing an increase in uncharged tRNAHis and thereby inducing the AAR (21.Thiaville M.M. Dudenhausen E.E. Zhong C. Pan Y.X. Kilberg M.S. Deprivation of protein or amino acid induces C/EBPβ synthesis and binding to amino acid response elements, but its action is not an absolute requirement for enhanced transcription.Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Replicating experiments with either DMEM-histidine or DMEM + HisOH yielded no qualitative differences. The MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted in DMSO. The initial concentrations tested were chosen based on previous studies (22.Thiaville M.M. Pan Y.X. Gjymishka A. Zhong C. Kaufman R.J. Kilberg M.S. MEK signaling is required for phosphorylation of eIF2α following amino acid limitation of HepG2 human hepatoma cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10848-10857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and then optimized as described in the text. All cell lines were pretreated with an equal volume of DMSO (control) or PD98059 for 1 h prior to activation of the AAR for the indicated times in the continued presence of inhibitor. HEK293T cells (0.5 × 106 cells/60-mm dish) were plated in DMEM 24 h before transfection to achieve 30–40% confluence. The cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing full-length ATF4 cDNA, a constitutively active MEK1 (MEKCA, kindly provided by Dr. Xingming Deng), or as a control, green fluorescent protein (GFP-pcDNA3.1) at 5 μg/60-mm dish, using a calcium phosphate protocol (23.Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Production of high-titer helper-free retroviruses by transient transfection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). The constitutively active MEKCA was created by the mutations S218E and S222D, two phospho-serine residues in the activation loop of MEK1 (24.Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Transformation of mammalian cells by constitutively active MAP kinase kinase.Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). The cells to be transfected were incubated with the plasmids overnight, washed twice with PBS, replenished with complete DMEM, and incubated for another 36 h prior to activation of the AAR. HC-04 human hepatocytes (MRA-156, MR4; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate. The GIPZ-shRNA plasmid constructs against GCN2 (catalog number RHS4430-101133792) or a nonsilencing Control (catalog number RHS4346) were purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). The shRNA constructs were packaged in HEK293T cells with the Trans-Lentiviral shRNA packaging kit (catalog number TLP5912) following the manufacturer's protocol. HepG2 cells were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h with lentiviral particles containing the shRNA construct. The infected cells were cultured with fresh culture medium for 48 h before puromycin selection (2.5 μg/ml) for at least 14 days. After the initial puromycin selection, individual clones were isolated by serial dilution and screened for the reduction in ATF4 induction following activation of the AAR. The siRNA si-ERK1 (L-003592-00-0005), siERK2 (L-003555-00-0005), siJNK1 (L-03514-00-0005), and siJNK2 (L-003505-00-0005) were purchased from Dharmacon/Thermoscientific and are unmodified siGENOME SMARTpool constructs. Transient siRNA transfections with 50 nm for each member to yield a total of 100 nm for siERK1+siERK2 or siJNK1+siJNK2 were performed in 12-well plates according to the manufacturer's protocol using DharmaFECT4 transfection reagent (T-2004-02) 72 h prior to activating the AAR. The same amount of siRNA with a scrambled sequence (D-001810-02-05) was used as the siControl. Total RNA was isolated with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's directions. Transcription activity (hnRNA) and steady state mRNA levels were assayed by qPCR, as described previously (25.Shan J. Fu L. Balasubramanian M.N. Anthony T. Kilberg M.S. ATF4-dependent regulation of the JMJD3 gene during amino acid deprivation can be rescued in Atf4-deficient cells by inhibition of deacetylation.J. Biol.

A 1-μg aliquot of total RNA was used to synthesize first strand cDNA with the qScript cDNA synthesis kit (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD). For qPCR, each cDNA sample was diluted 10× with TE buffer, 2 μl of this diluted solution was mixed with 10 μl of SYBR Green master mixture, and 5 pmol of forward and reverse primers were added in a total volume of 20 μl. The mixture was subjected to 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. The primers used are listed in Table 1. After qPCR, melting curves were acquired by stepwise increase from 55 to 95 °C to ensure that only a single product was amplified in the reaction. GAPDH was used as an internal control, and all calculations were based on the difference of threshold cycle number of the analyzed gene relative to the GAPDH mRNA content in the same sample.TABLE 1PCR primersPrimer specificityPrimer sequences (human)aFP, forward primer; RP, reverse primer.ASNS, mRNAFP 5′-GCAGCTGAAAGAAGCCCAAGT-3′RP 5′-TGTCTTCCATGCCAATTGCA-3′GCN2, mRNAFP 5′-GAAATGGTAAACATCGGGCAAACTC-3′RP 5′-TTCACAAGAGCCAGGAGAATCTTCAC-3′GAPDH, mRNAFP 5′-TTGGTATCGTGGAAGGACTC-3′RP 5′-ACAGTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGT-3′VEGF-A, mRNAFP 5′-ACTGAGGAGTCCAACATCAC-3′RP 5′-CTTGTCTTGCTCTATCTTTC-3′EGR1, mRNAFP 5′-AGAAGGACAAGAAAGCAGACAAAAGTGT-3′RP 5′-GGGGACGGGTAGGAAGAGAG-3′EGR1, transcription activityFP 5′-CTACGAGCACCTGACCGCAGG-3′RP 5′-ACAGGACGCCAGGATGGTGG-3′EGR1 P1, ChIP assayFP 5′-CCCCGTCTCAGAAAGAATAAAAACATTA-3′RP 5′-CCTTGTGTCTGAATGTCCATTTTGC-3′EGR1 P2, ChIP assayFP 5′-CCTCTTTCGGATTCCCGCAG-3′RP 5′-GGTCCTTGTGGTGAGGGGTCA-3′EGR1 P3, ChIP assayFP 5′-GAGGGAGCGAGGGAGCAACC-3′RP 5′-CTCCAAATAAGGTGCTGCCCAAA-3′EGR1 P4, ChIP assayFP 5′-CATATTAGGGCTTCCTGCTTCCCATA-3′RP 5′-CCGCCTCTATTTGAAGGGTCTGG-3′EGR1 P5, ChIP assayFP 5′-GTCACGACGGAGGCGGACC-3′RP 5′-CGGCGGCTCCCCAAGTTC-3′EGR1 P6, ChIP assayFP 5′-CGCAGAGGACCGAGCTTTTGT-3′RP 5′-GCAGCCCCGCTCATCAAAA-3′EGR1 P7, ChIP assayFP 5′-GGGGATTCTCCGTATTTGCGTC-3′RP 5′-GGCTACCATTGACTCCCGAGGT-3′EGR1 P8, ChIP assayFP 5′-GTCCCAGCTCATCAAACCCAGC-3′RP 5′-AGAAGCGGCGATCACAGGACTC-3′VEGF-A upstream, ChIP assayFP 5′-ACTTTCCTGCTCCCTCCTCGC-3′RP 5′-CCACCAAGGTTCACAGCCTG-3′VEGF-A promoter, ChIP assayFP 5′-CGCTCGGTGCTGGAATTTGATA-3′RP 5′-TGGGGAATGGCAAGCAAAAA-3′VEGF-A intron 1, ChIP assayFP 5′-GCTGTCACTGCCACTCGGTCTC-3′RP 5′-GCAGCAATCCACCCCAAAAC-3′VEGF-A intron 4, ChIP assayFP 5′-GTGAGGATGTAGTCACGGATTC-3′RP 5′-CCAAAGGTCACATAGCGGGA-3′JNK1, mRNAFP 5′-CCATTTCAGAATCAGACTCATGCCA-3′RP 5′-TGTGGTGTGAAAACATTCAAAAGGC-3′JNK2, mRNAFP 5′-GGGATTGTTGTGCTGCATTTGATAC-3′RP 5′-TGGTTCTGAAAAGGACGGCTTAGTTT-3′ERK1, mRNAFP 5′-CGCTTCCGCCATGAGAATGTC-3′RP 5′-CAGGTCAGTCTCCATCAGGTCCTG-3′ERK2, mRNAFP 5′-CGTGTTGCAGATCCAGACCATGAT-3′RP 5′-TGGACTTGGTGTAGCCCTTGGAA-3′ATF3, mRNAFP 5′-GAGCGGAGCCTGGAGCAAAA-3′RP 5′-GGGGACGATGGCAGAAGCACT-3′a FP, forward primer; RP, reverse primer. Open table in a new tab Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen), including DNase I treatment before the final elution to eliminate any DNA contamination. The integrity of total RNA was monitored with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). A 100-ng aliquot of total RNA from four independent incubations for each of four conditions (DMEM versus DMEM lacking histidine, each with or without 2.5 μm PD98059) was amplified using the GeneChip® WT PLUS reagent kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions, and then 5.5 μg of cDNA was fragmented and terminally labeled. Labeled targets were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 for 16 h at 45 °C and washed according to Affymetrix standard protocols. For gene expression analysis, arrays were normalized using RMA as implemented in Partek Genomics Suite 6.6 (Partek Incorporated, St. Louis, MO). Analysis of variance was used to detect differentially expressed genes. The microarray data have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE58869). Whole cell protein was extracted with a RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, containing Pierce protease and phosphatase inhibitor mini-tablets (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (26.Chen H. Pan Y.X. Dudenhausen E.E. Kilberg M.S.

The bound secondary antibody was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (32106; Thermo Scientific) and then exposing the blot to Classic Blue Autoradiography Film BX (MIDSCI, St. Louis, MO). ChIP analysis was performed according to a previously published protocol (26.Chen H. Pan Y.X. Dudenhausen E.E. Kilberg M.S.

HepG2 cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 107/150-mm dish with DMEM and cultured for ∼36 h, which includes a transfer to fresh DMEM during the final 12 h prior to AAR induction. Immunoprecipitation was performed with one of the following antibodies: rabbit anti-ATF4 polyclonal antibody described previously (27.Su N. Kilberg M.S.

The total ELK1 (9182) and S103 phospho-SRF (4261) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling, whereas the S383 phospho-ELK1 antibody was obtained from Abcam (32799; Boston, MA). Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed with qPCR as described above, using primers listed in Table 1. The ChIP results are presented as the ratio to input DNA. Each experiment contained three or more individual samples to detect experimental variation, and each experiment was repeated one or more times with separate batches of cells to ensure reproducibility between experiments. The data are expressed as the averages ± standard deviations within an individual experiment containing three or four replicates, and the results, analyzed using Student's t test, with p ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. A recent microarray expression analysis performed by our laboratory revealed the EGR1 gene to be the most highly induced gene following activation of the AAR in HepG2 hepatoma cells (10.Shan J.

To investigate the mechanism of the EGR1 induction in HepG2 cells, both transcription activity and steady state mRNA content was assayed from 1 to 24 h (Fig. 1A). The results showed that transcription from the EGR1 gene was increased within 2 h of AAR activation and was enhanced by more than 30-fold at 8 h. Steady state mRNA content paralleled the transcription activity (Fig. 1A), and cellular EGR1 protein content was also increased (Fig. 1B). The half-life of the EGR1 mRNA was modestly stabilized by AAR activation (Fig. 1C), but transcription appeared to account for most of the increased mRNA. Although the EGR1 induction was also evident in nontransformed, immortalized HC-04 human hepatocytes (Fig. 1D), compared with the HepG2 cells, it was considerably smaller in magnitude (compare values in Fig. 1A “steady state mRNA” to Fig. 1D). To determine whether this difference was linked to cellular transformation, additional human hepatoma cell lines were examined. The induction of EGR1 mRNA in Hep3B cells was less than 2-fold, and in LH86 cells it was ∼3.5-fold (data not shown). Interestingly, among the human hepatoma cells that did not exhibit significant EGR1 induction was the HepG2-derived subclone, C3A cells. The C3A subclone was selected from a parental HepG2 culture based on more “hepatocyte-like” properties (American Type Cell Culture). Although striking, this contrast between HepG2 and C3A cells is consistent with the expression array data of Lee et al. (9.Lee J.I. Dominy Jr., J.E. Sikalidis A.K. Hirschberger L.L. Wang W.

https://openalex.org/W1987116762,"Gradients of environmental stress may affect biotic interactions in unpredictable ways responding to climate variation, depending on the abiotic stress tolerance of interacting partners. Here, we study the effect of local climate on the intensity of feather mites in six mountain passerines along a 1400 m elevational gradient characterized by shifting temperature and rainfall. Although obligatory symbionts of warm-blooded organisms are assumed to live in mild and homeothermic environments, those inhabiting external, non-blood-irrigated body portions of the host organism, such as feather mites, are expected to endure exposure to the direct influence of a fluctuating climate. As expected, feather mite intensity declined with elevation in all bird species, a pattern that was also found in cold-adapted passerines that have typical alpine habits. The elevation cline was mainly explained by a positive effect of the average temperature upon mite intensity in five of the six species studied. Precipitation explained less variance in mite intensity than average temperature, and showed a negative correlation in half of the studied species. We found no climate-driven migration of mites along the wings of birds, no replacement of mite species along elevation gradients and no association with available food resources for mites (estimated by the size of the uropygial gland). This study suggests that ectosymbionts of warm-blooded animals may be highly sensitive to climatic variation and become less abundant under stressful environmental conditions, providing empirical evidence of the decline of specialized biotic interactions among animal species at high elevations."
https://openalex.org/W2022557163,"Relapse of adenocarcinoma, the most common non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is a major clinical challenge to improving survival. To gain insight into the early molecular events that contribute to lung adenocarcinoma relapse, and taking into consideration potential cell type specificity, we used stringent criteria for sample selection. We measured miRNA expression only from flash frozen stage I lung adenocarcinomas, excluding other NSCLC subtypes. We compared miRNA expression in lung adenocarcinomas that relapsed within two years to those that did not relapse within three years after surgical resection prior to adjuvant therapy. The most significant differences in mRNA expression for recurrent tumors compared to non-recurrent tumors were decreases in miR-106b*, -187, -205, -449b, -774* and increases in miR-151-3p, let-7b, miR-215, -520b, and -512-3p. A unique comparison between adjacent normal lung tissue from relapse and non-relapse groups revealed dramatically different miRNA expression, suggesting dysregulation of miRNA in the environment around the tumor. To assess patient-to-patient variability, miRNA levels in the tumors were normalized to levels in matched adjacent normal lung tissue. This analysis revealed a different set of significantly altered miRNA in tumors that recurred compared to tumors that did not. Together our analyses elucidated miRNA not previously linked to lung adenocarcinoma that likely have important roles in its development and progression. Our results also highlight the differences in miRNA expression in normal lung tissue in adenocarcinomas that do and do not recur. Most notably, our data identified those miRNA that distinguish early stage tumors likely to relapse prior to treatment and miRNA that could be further studied for use as biomarkers for prognosis, patient monitoring, and/or treatment decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2074941881,"Background The Alberta Project Promoting active Living and healthy Eating in Schools (APPLE Schools) is a comprehensive school health program that is proven feasible and effective in preventing obesity among school aged children. To support decision making on expanding this program, evidence on its long-term health and economic impacts is particularly critical. In the present study we estimate the life course impact of the APPLE Schools programs in terms of future body weights and avoided health care costs. Method We modeled growth rates of body mass index (BMI) using longitudinal data from the National Population Health Survey collected between 1996–2008. These growth rate characteristics were used to project BMI trajectories for students that attended APPLE Schools and for students who attended control schools (141 randomly selected schools) in the Canadian province of Alberta. Results Throughout the life course, the prevalence of overweight (including obesity) was 1.2% to 2.8% (1.7 on average) less among students attending APPLE Schools relative to their peers attending control schools. The life course prevalence of obesity was 0.4% to 1.4% (0.8% on average) less among APPLE Schools students. If the APPLE Schools program were to be scaled up, the potential cost savings would be $33 to 82 million per year for the province of Alberta, or $150 to 330 million per year for Canada. Conclusions These projected health and economic benefits seem to support broader implementation of school-based health promotion programs."
https://openalex.org/W2037013077,"The floral transcriptome of Orchis italica, a wild orchid species, was obtained using Illumina RNA-seq technology and specific de novo assembly and analysis tools. More than 100 million raw reads were processed resulting in 132,565 assembled transcripts and 86,079 unigenes with an average length of 606 bp and N50 of 956 bp. Functional annotation assigned 38,984 of the unigenes to records present in the NCBI non-redundant protein database, 32,161 of them to Gene Ontology terms, 15,775 of them to Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG) and 7,143 of them to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. The in silico expression analysis based on the Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR experiments on 10 selected unigenes, which showed high and statistically significant positive correlation with the RNA-seq based expression data. The prediction of putative long non-coding RNAs was assessed using two different software packages, CPC and Portrait, resulting in 7,779 unannotated unigenes that matched the threshold values for both of the analyses. Among the predicted long non-coding RNAs, one is the homologue of TAS3, a long non-coding RNA precursor of trans-acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs). The differential expression pattern observed for the selected putative long non-coding RNAs suggests their possible functional role in different floral tissues."

In this study, mRNA and protein expression of the receptors EPHA1 and EPHA2 as well as of their ligand EFNA1 and their prognostic relevance in clear cell renal cell carcinoma was evaluated. Gene expression was measured in 75 cryo-preserved primary tumors and matched non-malignant renal specimens by quantitative PCR. Protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays comprising non-malignant, primary tumors and metastatic renal tissues of 241 patients. Gene and protein expression of all three factors was altered in tumor specimens with EPHA1 and EPHA2 being generally diminished in tumors compared to normal renal tissue, whereas EFNA1 was commonly elevated. A positive EPHA1 and EPHA2 protein staining as well as a low EFNA1 protein level were significantly linked to more aggressive tumor features, but only a positive EPHA1 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with poor survival. In subgroup analyses, EPHA1 and EPHA2 protein levels were significantly higher in metastatic than in primary lesions. Patients with EPHA1/EPHA2-positive tumors or with tumors with positive EPHA1 and low EFNA1 immunoreactivity had the shortest survival rates compared to the respective other combinations. In a multivariate model, EPHA1 was an independent prognostic marker for different survival endpoints. In conclusion, an impaired EPH-ephrin signaling could contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma."

Its mechanism of action involves the activation of nuclear factor E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which plays a key role in regulation of genes driven by antioxidant response element (ARE). Inspired by the effect of resveratrol, here we synthesized a series of imine resveratrol analogs (IRAs), evaluated their abilities to activate Nrf2 by using cell based ARE-reporter assay. After the first-round screening, preliminary and quantitative structure-activity relationship (SAR) was analyzed, and the structural features determining Nrf2 activation ability were proposed.

In this study we investigated the role of cytosolic nucleotides in regulating the activity of the vacuolar anion channel AtALMT9. We found that cytosolic nucleotides modulate the transport activity of AtALMT9. This modulation was based on a direct block of the pore of the channel at negative membrane potentials (open channel block) by the nucleotide and not by a phosphorylation mechanism.

The blocking efficiency of intracellular nucleotides increased with the number of phosphate groups and ATP was the most effective cellular blocker. Interestingly, the ATP block induced a marked modification of the current-voltage characteristic of AtALMT9. In addition, increased concentrations of vacuolar anions were able to shift the ATP block threshold to a more negative membrane potential. The block of AtALMT9-mediated anion currents by ATP at negative membrane potentials acts as a gate of the channel and vacuolar anion tune this gating mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W1987612459,"We analysed field-collected quantitative data of benthic marine molluscs across the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary in Patagonia to identify patterns and processes of biodiversity reconstruction after the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. We contrast diversity dynamics from nearshore environments with those from offshore environments. In both settings, Early Palaeogene (Danian) assemblages are strongly dominated by surviving lineages, many of which changed their relative abundance from being rare before the extinction event to becoming the new dominant forms. Only a few of the species in the Danian assemblages were newly evolved. In offshore environments, however, two newly evolved Danian bivalve species attained ecological dominance by replacing two ecologically equivalent species that disappeared at the end of the Cretaceous. In both settings, the total number of Danian genera at a locality remained below the total number of late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) genera at that locality. We suggest that biotic interactions, in particular incumbency effects, suppressed post-extinction diversity and prevented the compensation of diversity loss by originating and invading taxa. Contrary to the total number of genera at localities, diversity at the level of individual fossiliferous horizons before and after the boundary is indistinguishable in offshore environments. This indicates an evolutionary rapid rebound to pre-extinction values within less than ca 0.5 million years. In nearshore environments, by contrast, diversity of fossiliferous horizons was reduced in the Danian, and this lowered diversity lasted for the entire studied post-extinction interval. In this heterogeneous environment, low connectivity among populations may have retarded the recolonisation of nearshore habitats by survivors."
https://openalex.org/W2036948082,"Purpose Intraoperative frozen section (FS) is an effective diagnostic test for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). We evaluated the diagnostic characteristics of single- and multiplex-site intraoperative FS, and evaluated the results of single-site FS combined with those of C-reactive protein (CRP) level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for assessing PJI. Methods We studied 156 painful joint arthroplasties in 152 consecutive patients presenting for revision total joint arthroplasty due to PJI. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to determine the optimal cutoff values for CRP level, ESR, and intraoperative FS histopathology. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of the diagnostic tests were assessed using a 2×2 table. Results We investigated the diagnostic utility of polymorphonuclear leukocyte number (PMN) per high-power field (HPF) on FS. Our data showed that 5 PMNs per HPF is a suitable diagnostic threshold, with a high accuracy in single- and multiplex-site FS. Five PMNs in any 1 of 5 sites had the highest sensitivity of 0.86 and a specificity of 0.96. Five PMNs in every 1 of 5 sites had greater diagnostic utility, with a specificity of 1; however, the sensitivity of this measure fell to 0.62. Five PMNs in single-site FS had a sensitivity of 0.70 and a specificity of 0.94. Five PMNs in single-site FS or CRP level ≥15 mg/L increased the sensitivity to 0.92; however, the specificity decreased to 0.79. Conclusion Compared with single-site FS, any 1 positive site on multiplex-site FS may improve sensitivity, while every 1 positive site on multiplex-site FS may improve specificity. Five PMNs in any 1 of 5 sites on FS has excellent utility for the diagnosis of PJI. Additional systematic large-scale studies are needed to verify this result."
https://openalex.org/W2041347508,"Background One major circulating HIV-1 subtype in Southeast Asian countries is CRF01_AE, but little is known about its epidemiology in Japan. We conducted a molecular phylodynamic study of patients newly diagnosed with CRF01_AE from 2003 to 2010. Methods Plasma samples from patients registered in Japanese Drug Resistance HIV-1 Surveillance Network were analyzed for protease-reverse transcriptase sequences; all sequences undergo subtyping and phylogenetic analysis using distance-matrix-based, maximum likelihood and Bayesian coalescent Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) phylogenetic inferences. Transmission clusters were identified using interior branch test and depth-first searches for sub-tree partitions. Times of most recent common ancestor (tMRCAs) of significant clusters were estimated using Bayesian MCMC analysis. Results Among 3618 patient registered in our network, 243 were infected with CRF01_AE. The majority of individuals with CRF01_AE were Japanese, predominantly male, and reported heterosexual contact as their risk factor. We found 5 large clusters with ≥5 members and 25 small clusters consisting of pairs of individuals with highly related CRF01_AE strains. The earliest cluster showed a tMRCA of 1996, and consisted of individuals with their known risk as heterosexual contacts. The other four large clusters showed later tMRCAs between 2000 and 2002 with members including intravenous drug users (IVDU) and non-Japanese, but not men who have sex with men (MSM). In contrast, small clusters included a high frequency of individuals reporting MSM risk factors. Phylogenetic analysis also showed that some individuals infected with HIV strains spread in East and South-eastern Asian countries. Conclusions Introduction of CRF01_AE viruses into Japan is estimated to have occurred in the 1990s. CFR01_AE spread via heterosexual behavior, then among persons connected with non-Japanese, IVDU, and MSM. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that some viral variants are largely restricted to Japan, while others have a broad geographic distribution."

We characterized the mpz gene, which encodes myelin protein zero and is up-regulated in oligodendroglia following axonal injury. The 2.5-kb mpz mRNA is expressed from a single TATA box promoter. Four independent Tg(mpz:egfp) transgenic zebrafish lines, in which GFP was expressed under the mpz promoter and 10 kb of genomic 5′-flanking sequence, showed transgene expression in CNS oligodendrocytes from larval development through adulthood. Following optic nerve crush injury, the mpz:egfp transgene was strongly up-regulated in oligodendrocytes along the regenerating retinotectal projection, mirroring up-regulation of endogenous mpz mRNA. GFP-expressing oligodendroglia were significantly more abundant in the regenerating optic pathway, resulting from both transgene induction in oligodendroglial precursors and the birth of new cells. Up-regulation of the mpz:egfp transgene was not dependent on axonal regeneration, suggesting that the primary signal may be axonal loss, debris, or microglial infiltration. Deletion experiments indicated that an oligodendroglial enhancer located in the region from −6 to −10 kb with respect to the mpz transcriptional start site is dissociable from the cis-regulatory element mediating the mpz transcriptional response to axonal injury, which is located between −1 and −4 kb. These data show that different mechanisms regulate expression of zebrafish mpz in myelinating oligodendrocytes and its induction following axonal injury. The underlying molecular events could potentially be exploited to enhance axonal repair following mammalian CNS injury.

Design Nationwide population-based cross-sectional study. Methods A nationally representative dataset acquired from the 2010–2012 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was analyzed. The dataset involved information for 4,377 postmenopausal women aged ≥50 years with a fundus photograph evaluable for AMD in either eye. All participants were interviewed using standardized questionnaires to determine reproductive factors including menstruation, pregnancy, parity, lactation, and hormonal use. The association between reproductive factors and each type of AMD was investigated. Results The mean age of the study participants was 63.1±0.2 years. Mean ages at menarche and menopause were 16.1±0.0 and 49.2±0.1 years, respectively. The overall prevalence rates of early and late AMD were 11.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.1–12.5) and 0.8% (95% CI, 0.5–1.2), respectively. When adjusted for age, neither smoking nor alcohol use was associated with the presence of any AMD or late AMD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed age (OR, 1.12 per 1 year), duration of lactation (OR, 0.91 per 6 months), and duration of use of oral contraceptive pills (OCP) (OR, 1.10 per 6 months) as associated factors for late AMD. The other variables did not yield a significant correlation with the risk of any AMD or late AMD. Conclusion After controlling for confounders, a longer duration of lactation appeared to protect against the development of late AMD. A longer duration of OCP use was associated with a higher risk of late AMD."
https://openalex.org/W2032120532,"Background LPS-binding protein (LBP) and its ligand CD14 are located upstream of the signaling pathway for LPS-induced inflammation. Blocking LBP and CD14 binding might prevent LPS-induced inflammation. In previous studies, we obtained a peptide analog (MP12) for the LBP/CD14 binding site and showed that this peptide analog had anti-endotoxin activity. In this study, we used in vitro directed evolution for this peptide analog to improve its in vivo and in vitro anti-endotoxin activity. Methods We used error-prone PCR (ep-PCR) and induced mutations in the C-terminus of LBP and attached the PCR products to T7 phages to establish a mutant phage display library. The positive clones that competed with LBP for CD14 binding was obtained by screening. We used both in vivo and in vitro experiments to compare the anti-endotoxin activities of a polypeptide designated P1 contained in a positive clone and MP12. Results 11 positive clones were obtained from among target phages. Sequencing showed that 9 positive clones had a threonine (T) to methionine (M) mutation in amino acid 287 of LBP. Compared to polypeptide MP12, polypeptide P1 significantly inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α expression and NF-κB activity in U937 cells (P<0.05). Compared to MP12, P1 significantly improved arterial oxygen pressure, an oxygenation index, and lung pathology scores in LPS-induced ARDS rats (P<0.05). Conclusion By in vitro directed evolution of peptide analogs for the LBP/CD14 binding site, we established a new polypeptide (P1) with a threonine (T)-to-methionine (M) mutation in amino acid 287 of LBP. This polypeptide had high anti-endotoxin activity in vitro and in vivo, which suggested that amino acid 287 in the C-terminus of LBP may play an important role in LBP binding with CD14."

Gastric adenocarcinoma, the most common type of gastric cancer, is heterogeneous and its incidence and cause varies widely with geographical regions, gender, ethnicity, and diet. Since unique mutations have been observed in individual human cancer samples, identification and characterization of the molecular alterations underlying individual gastric adenocarcinomas is a critical step for developing more effective, personalized therapies. Until recently, identifying genetic mutations on an individual basis by DNA sequencing remained a daunting task. Recent advances in new next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, such as the semiconductor-based Ion Torrent sequencing platform, makes DNA sequencing cheaper, faster, and more reliable. In this study, we aim to identify genetic mutations in the genes which are targeted by drugs in clinical use or are under development in individual human gastric adenocarcinoma samples using Ion Torrent sequencing. We sequenced 737 loci from 45 cancer-related genes in 238 human gastric adenocarcinoma samples using the Ion Torrent Ampliseq Cancer Panel. The sequencing analysis revealed a high occurrence of mutations along the TP53 locus (9.7%) in our sample set. Thus, this study indicates the utility of a cost and time efficient tool such as Ion Torrent sequencing to screen cancer mutations for the development of personalized cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2088423832,"The type two secretion system is a large, trans-envelope apparatus that secretes toxins across the outer membrane of many Gram-negative bacteria. In Aeromonas hydrophila, ExeA interacts with peptidoglycan and forms a heteromultimeric complex with ExeB that is required for assembly of the ExeD secretin of the secretion system in the outer membrane. While the peptidoglycan-ExeAB (PG-AB) complex is required for ExeD assembly, the assembly mechanism remains unresolved. We analyzed protein-protein interactions to address the hypothesis that ExeD assembly in the outer membrane requires direct interaction with the PG-AB complex. Yeast and bacterial two hybrid analyses demonstrated an interaction between the periplasmic domains of ExeB and ExeD. Two-codon insertion mutagenesis of exeD disrupted lipase secretion, and immunoblotting of whole cells demonstrated significantly reduced secretin in mutant cells. Mapping of the two-codon insertions and deletion analysis showed that the ExeB-ExeD interaction involves the N0 and N1 subdomains of ExeD. Rotational anisotropy using the purified periplasmic domains of ExeB and ExeD determined that the apparent dissociation constant of the interaction is 1.19±0.16 µM. These results contribute important support for a putative mechanism by which the PG-AB complex facilitates assembly of ExeD through direct interaction between ExeB and ExeD. Furthermore, our results provide novel insight into the assembly function of ExeB that may contribute to elucidating the role of homologous proteins in secretion of toxins from other Gram negative pathogens."

In addition, stimuli that activate PA phosphatases, leading to lower PA levels, increased lamellipodia and filopodia formation. Lower PA levels were observed in the leading edge than in the trailing edge of migrating HeLa cells. In MSC80 and OLN93 cells, which are stable cell lines derived from Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes, respectively, a higher ratio of diacylglycerol to PA levels was demonstrated in the membrane processes involved in myelination, compared to the cell body. We propose that the PA sensors reported here are valuable tools to unveil the role of PA in a variety of intracellular signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2105427792,"Decompressive craniectomy (DC), an operation whereby part of the skull is removed, is used in the management of patients with brain swelling. While the aim of DC is to reduce intracranial pressure, there is the risk that brain deformation and mechanical strain associated with the operation could damage the brain tissue. The nature and extent of the resulting strain regime is poorly understood at present. Finite element (FE) models of DC can provide insight into this applied strain and hence assist in deciding on the best surgical procedures. However there is uncertainty about how well these models match experimental data, which are difficult to obtain clinically. Hence there is a need to validate any modelling approach outside the clinical setting. This paper develops an axisymmetric FE model of an idealised DC to assess the key features of such an FE model which are needed for an accurate simulation of DC. The FE models are compared with an experimental model using gelatin hydrogel, which has similar poro-viscoelastic material property characteristics to brain tissue. Strain on a central plane of the FE model and the front face of the experimental model, deformation and load relaxation curves are compared between experiment and FE. Results show good agreement between the FE and experimental models, providing confidence in applying the proposed FE modelling approach to DC. Such a model should use material properties appropriate for brain tissue and include a more realistic whole head geometry."

However, putative role of signaling molecules has not been tested in schizophrenia patients based on severity of illness, despite its biological plausibility. In the present study we investigated the possible association of polymorphisms from five candidate genes RGS4, SLC6A3, PIP4K2A, BDNF, PI4KA with response to antipsychotic in variably ill schizophrenia patients. Thus in present study, a total 53 SNPs on the basis of previous reports and functional grounds were examined for their association with antipsychotic response in 423 schizophrenia patients segregated into low and high severity groups. Additionally, haplotype, diplotype, multivariate logistic regression and multifactor-dimensionality reduction (MDR) analyses were performed. Furthermore, observed associations were investigated in atypical monotherapy (n = 355) and risperidone (n = 260) treated subgroups. All associations were estimated as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) and test for multiple corrections was applied. Single locus analysis showed significant association of nine variants from SLC6A3, PIP4K2A and BDNF genes with incomplete antipsychotic response in schizophrenia patients with high severity. We identified significant association of six marker diplotype ATTGCT/ATTGCT (rs746203-rs10828317-rs7094131-rs2296624-rs11013052-rs1409396) of PIP4K2A gene in incomplete responders (corrected p-value = 0.001; adjusted-OR = 3.19, 95%-CI = 1.46-6.98) with high severity. These associations were further observed in atypical monotherapy and risperidone sub-groups. MDR approach identified gene-gene interaction among BDNF_rs7103411-BDNF_rs1491851-SLC6A3_rs40184 in severely ill incomplete responders (OR = 7.91, 95%-CI = 4.08-15.36). While RGS4_rs2842026-SLC6A3_rs2975226 interacted synergistically in incomplete responders with low severity (OR = 4.09, 95%-CI = 2.09-8.02). Our findings provide strong evidence that diplotype ATTGCT/ATTGCT of PIP4K2A gene conferred approximately three-times higher incomplete responsiveness towards antipsychotics in severely ill patients. These results are consistent with the known role of phosphatidyl-inositol-signaling elements in antipsychotic action and outcome. Findings have implication for future molecular genetic studies as well as personalized medicine. However more work is warranted to elucidate underlying causal biological pathway."

The S. cerevisiae structural homolog of opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans CaMPS1, is indispensable for the cell viability. The essentiality of Mps1 was confirmed by Homozygote Trisome test. To determine its biological function in this pathogen conditional mutant was generated through regulatable MET3 promoter. Examination of heterozygous and conditional (+Met/Cys) mps1 mutants revealed a mitosis specific arrest phenotype, where mutants showed large buds with undivided nuclei. Flowcytometry analysis revealed abnormal ploidy levels in mps1mutant. In presence of anti-microtubule drug Nocodazole, mps1 mutant showed a dramatic loss of viability suggesting a role of Mps1 in Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) activation. These mutants were also defective in microtubule organization. Moreover, heterozygous mutant showed defective in-vitro yeast to hyphae morphological transition. Growth defect in heterozygous mutant suggest haploinsufficiency of this gene. qRT PCR analysis showed around 3 fold upregulation of MPS1 in presence of serum. This expression of MPS1 is dependent on Efg1and is independent of other hyphal regulators like Ras1 and Tpk2. Furthermore, mps1 mutants were also sensitive to oxidative stress. Heterozygous mps1 mutant did not undergo morphological transition and showed 5-Fold reduction in colony forming units in response to macrophage. Thus, the vital checkpoint kinase, Mps1 besides cell division also has a role in morphogenesis and oxidative stress tolerance, in this pathogenic fungus."
https://openalex.org/W2333050661,"Functional heterologous expression of naturally expressed mouse α6*-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (mα6*-nAChRs; where ""*"" indicates the presence of additional subunits) has been difficult. Here we expressed and characterized wild-type (WT), gain-of-function, chimeric, or gain-of-function chimeric nAChR subunits, sometimes as hybrid nAChRs containing both human (h) and mouse (m) subunits, in Xenopus oocytes. Hybrid mα6mβ4hβ3- (∼ 5-8-fold) or WT mα6mβ4mβ3-nAChRs (∼ 2-fold) yielded higher function than mα6mβ4-nAChRs. Function was not detected when mα6 and mβ2 subunits were expressed together or in the additional presence of hβ3 or mβ3 subunits. However, function emerged upon expression of mα6mβ2mβ3(V9'S)-nAChRs containing β3 subunits having gain-of-function V9'S (valine to serine at the 9'-position) mutations in transmembrane domain II and was further elevated 9-fold when hβ3(V9'S) subunits were substituted for mβ3(V9'S) subunits. Studies involving WT or gain-of-function chimeric mouse/human β3 subunits narrowed the search for domains that influence functional expression of mα6*-nAChRs. Using hβ3 subunits as templates for site-directed mutagenesis studies, substitution with mβ3 subunit residues in extracellular N-terminal domain loops ""C"" (Glu(221) and Phe(223)), ""E"" (Ser(144) and Ser(148)), and ""β2-β3"" (Gln(94) and Glu(101)) increased function of mα6mβ2*- (∼ 2-3-fold) or mα6mβ4* (∼ 2-4-fold)-nAChRs. EC50 values for nicotine acting at mα6mβ4*-nAChR were unaffected by β3 subunit residue substitutions in loop C or E. Thus, amino acid residues located in primary (loop C) or complementary (loops β2-β3 and E) interfaces of β3 subunits are some of the molecular impediments for functional expression of mα6mβ2β3- or mα6mβ4β3-nAChRs."
https://openalex.org/W1970548476,"Acid rain (AR) is a serious environmental issue inducing harmful impacts on plant growth and development. It has been reported that Liquidambar formosana, considered as an AR-sensitive tree species, was largely injured by AR, compared with Schima superba, an AR-tolerant tree species. To clarify the different responses of these two species to AR, a comparative proteomic analysis was conducted in this study. More than 1000 protein spots were reproducibly detected on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels. Among them, 74 protein spots from L. formosana gels and 34 protein spots from S. superba gels showed significant changes in their abundances under AR stress. In both L. formosana and S. superba, the majority proteins with more than 2 fold changes were involved in photosynthesis and energy production, followed by material metabolism, stress and defense, transcription, post-translational and modification, and signal transduction. In contrast with L. formosana, no hormone response-related protein was found in S. superba. Moreover, the changes of proteins involved in photosynthesis, starch synthesis, and translation were distinctly different between L. formosana and S. superba. Protein expression analysis of three proteins (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase) by Western blot was well correlated with the results of proteomics. In conclusion, our study provides new insights into AR stress responses in woody plants and clarifies the differences in strategies to cope with AR between L. formosana and S. superba."
https://openalex.org/W2026511326,"The Lipid A moiety of endotoxin potently activates TLR-4 dependent host innate immune responses. We demonstrate that Lipid-A mediated leukotriene biosynthesis regulates pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP)-dependent macrophage activation. Stimulation of murine macrophages (RAW264.7) with E. coli 0111:B4 endotoxin (LPS) or Kdo2-lipid A (Lipid A) induced inflammation and Lipid A was sufficient to induce TLR-4 mediated macrophage inflammation and rapid ERK activation. The contribution of leukotriene biosynthesis was evaluated with a 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor, MK591. MK591 pre-treatment not only enhanced but also sustained ERK activation for up to 4 hours after LPS and Lipid A stimulation while inhibiting cell proliferation and enhancing cellular apoptosis. Leukotriene biosynthesis inhibition attenuated inflammation induced by either whole LPS or the Lipid A fraction. These responses were regulated by inhibition of the key biosynthesis enzymes for the proinflammatory eicosanoids, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) quantified by immunoblotting. Inhibition of leukotriene biosynthesis differentially regulated TLR-2 and TLR-4 cell surface expression assessed by flow cytometry, suggesting a close mechanistic association between TLR expression and 5-LO associated eicosanoid activity in activated macrophages. Furthermore, MK591 pre-treatment enhanced ERK activation and inhibited cell proliferation after LPS or Lipid A stimulation. These effects were regulated in part by increased apoptosis and modulation of cell surface TLR expression. Together, these data clarify the mechanistic association between 5-lipoxygenase activating protein-mediated leukotriene biosynthesis and 5-LO dependent eicosanoid metabolites in mediating the TLR-dependent inflammatory response after endotoxin exposure typical of bacterial sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2029742652,"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by α-synuclein aggregation in oligodendrocytes and neurons. Using a transgenic mouse model overexpressing human α-synuclein in oligodendrocytes, we previously demonstrated that oligodendrocytic α-synuclein inclusions induce neuronal α-synuclein accumulation and progressive neuronal degeneration. α-Synuclein binds to β-III tubulin, leading to the neuronal accumulation of insoluble α-synuclein in an MSA mouse model. The present study demonstrates that α-synuclein co-localizes with β-III tubulin in the brain tissue from patients with MSA and MSA model transgenic mice as well as neurons cultured from these mice. Accumulation of insoluble α-synuclein in MSA mouse neurons was blocked by the peptide fragment β-III tubulin (residues 235-282). We have determined the α-synuclein-binding domain of β-III tubulin and demonstrated that a short fragment containing this domain can suppress α-synuclein accumulation in the primary cultured cells. Administration of a short α-synuclein-binding fragment of β-III tubulin may be a novel therapeutic strategy for MSA."
https://openalex.org/W2081979650,"X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) is caused by a genetic mutation within the common gamma chain (γc), an essential component of the cytokine receptors for interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. XSCID patients are most commonly treated with bone marrow transplants (BMT) to restore systemic immune function. However, BMT-XSCID humans and dogs remain at an increased risk for development of cutaneous papillomavirus (PV) infections and their associated neoplasms, most typically cutaneous papillomas. Since basal keratinocytes are the target cell for the initial PV infection, we wanted to determine if canine XSCID keratinocytes have a diminished antiviral cytokine response to poly(dA:dT) and canine papillomavirus-2 (CPV-2) upon initial infection. We performed quantitative RT-PCR for antiviral cytokines and downstream interferon stimulated genes (ISG) on poly(dA:dT) stimulated and CPV-2 infected monolayer keratinocyte cultures derived from XSCID and normal control dogs. We found that XSCID keratinocytes responded similarly to poly(dA:dT) as normal keratinocytes by upregulating antiviral cytokines and ISGs. CPV-2 infection of both XSCID and normal keratinocytes did not result in upregulation of antiviral cytokines or ISGs at 2, 4, or 6 days post infection. These data suggest that the antiviral response to initial PV infection of basal keratinocytes is similar between XSCID and normal patients, and is not the likely source for the remaining immunodeficiency in XSCID patients."
https://openalex.org/W1972070772,"Protein phosphatase 1I (PP-1I) is a major endogenous form of protein phosphatase 1 (PP-1) that consists of the core catalytic subunit PP-1c and the regulatory subunit inhibitor 2 (I-2). Phosphorylation of the Thr-72 residue of I-2 is required for activation of PP-1I. We studied the effects of two protein kinases identified previously in purified brain PP-1I by mass spectrometry, Cdc25C-associated kinase 1 (C-TAK1) and PFTAIRE (PFTK1) kinase, for their ability to regulate PP-1I. Purified C-TAK1 phosphorylated I-2 in reconstituted PP-1I (PP-1c. I-2) on Ser-71, which resulted in partial inhibition of its ATP-dependent phosphatase activity and inhibited subsequent phosphorylation of Thr-72 by the exogenous activating kinase GSK-3. In contrast, purified PFTK1 phosphorylated I-2 at Ser-86, a site known to potentiate Thr-72 phosphorylation and activation of PP-1I phosphatase activity by GSK-3. These findings indicate that brain PP-1I associates with and is regulated by the associated protein kinases C-TAK1 and PFTK1. Multisite phosphorylation of the I-2 regulatory subunit of PP-1I leads to activation or inactivation of PP-1I through bidirectional modulation of Thr-72 phosphorylation, the critical activating residue of I-2."
https://openalex.org/W1991963519,"Aims/Hypothesis Recently, cardiotrophin-1, a member of the interleukin-6 family of cytokines was described to protect beta-cells from apoptosis, to improve glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin resistance, and to prevent streptozotocin-induced diabetes in mice. Here, we studied whether common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CTF1 locus, encoding cardiotrophin-1, influence insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in humans. Methods We genotyped 1,771 German subjects for three CTF1 tagging SNPs (rs1046276, rs1458201, and rs8046707). The subjects were metabolically characterized by an oral glucose tolerance test. Subgroups underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging/spectroscopy and hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps. Results After appropriate adjustment, the minor allele of CTF1 SNP rs8046707 was significantly associated with decreased in vivo measures of insulin sensitivity. The other tested SNPs were not associated with OGTT-derived sensitivity parameters, nor did the three tested SNPs show any association with OGTT-derived parameters of insulin release. In the MR subgroup, SNP rs8046707 was nominally associated with lower visceral adipose tissue. Furthermore, the SNP rs1458201 showed a nominal association with increased VLDL levels. Conclusions In conclusion, this study, even though preliminary and awaiting further confirmation by independent replication, provides first evidence that common genetic variation in CTF1 could contribute to insulin sensitivity in humans. Our SNP data indicate an insulin-desensitizing effect of cardiotrophin-1 and underline that cardiotrophin-1 represents an interesting target to influence insulin sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1975060172,"Many populations of cells cooperate through the production of extracellular materials. These materials (enzymes, siderophores) spread by diffusion and can be applied by both the cooperator and cheater (non-producer) cells. In this paper the problem of coexistence of cooperator and cheater cells is studied on a 1D lattice where cooperator cells produce a diffusive material which is beneficial to the individuals according to the local concentration of this public good. The reproduction success of a cell increases linearly with the benefit in the first model version and increases non-linearly (saturates) in the second version. Two types of update rules are considered; either the cooperative cell stops producing material before death (death-production-birth, DpB) or it produces the common material before it is selected to die (production-death-birth, pDB). The empty space is occupied by its neighbors according to their replication rates. By using analytical and numerical methods I have shown that coexistence of the cooperator and cheater cells is possible although atypical in the linear version of this 1D model if either DpB or pDB update rule is assumed. While coexistence is impossible in the non-linear model with pDB update rule, it is one of the typical behaviors in case of the non-linear model with DpB update rule."
https://openalex.org/W1982579946,"Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease leading to profound disfiguring causing socio economic burden in the tropics. Current diagnosis strategies available during field surveys and epidemics are based on traditional microscopic detections and a few antigen/antibody assays. We have compared different sampling methodologies and standardized the highly sensitive and reliable rWbSXP-1 antigen detection assay to our new sampling methodology.Samples collected as serum, whole blood, whole blood on filter paper and whole blood on microscopic slides from patients belonging to various clinical groups of filariasis [endemic normal(EN), chronic pathology(CP), microfilaraemic(MF) and non-endemic normal(NEN)] were collected and standardized the rWbSXP-1 antigen detection assay using monoclonal antibody raised against rWbSXP-1 protein. The whole blood collected on microscopic slide based sampling method was employed in the field and the presence of circulating filarial antigen (CFA) was assessed using the rWbSXP-1 assay.The sampling methods were compared and no significant difference was observed for the detection of CFA (MF, P = 0.304, EN, P = 0.675, CP, P = 0.5698, NEN, P = 0.4494). Further the optimized sampling method was utilized to collect the 1106 samples from Polur, Tiruvannamalai. The rWbSXP-1 assay gave 98 antigen positive results whereas the microscopic method gave only 17.Four sampling methodologies were analyzed and the new sampling methodology of whole blood collected on microscopic slide was found to be convenient for the detection of CFA using rWbSXP-1 antigen detection assay. The 1106 samples from Polur were collected using the new method. The rWbSXP-1 antigen assay perceived a 7.32% increased result which was read as false negatives on the conventional microscopic staining method. This new sampling methodology coupled with the rWbSXP-1 antigen assay can be used in epidemiological surveys for lymphatic filariasis and the same sampling methodology can be expanded to other antigen based high affinity assays."
https://openalex.org/W2054620886,"Since its development, microarray technology has evolved to a standard method in the biotechnological and medical field with a broad range of applications. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of the hybridization process of PCR-products to microarray capture probes is still not completely understood, and several observed phenomena cannot be explained with current models. We investigated the influence of several parameters on the hybridization reaction and identified ssDNA to play a major role in the process. An increase of the ssDNA content in a hybridization reaction strongly enhanced resulting signal intensities. A strong influence could also be observed when unlabeled ssDNA was added to the hybridization reaction. A reduction of the ssDNA content resulted in a massive decrease of the hybridization efficiency. According to these data, we developed a novel model for the hybridization mechanism. This model is based on the assumption that single stranded DNA is necessary as catalyst to induce the hybridization of dsDNA. The developed hybridization model is capable of giving explanations for several yet unresolved questions regarding the functionality of microarrays. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of the hybridization process, but also have immediate practical use in data interpretation and the development of new microarrays."
