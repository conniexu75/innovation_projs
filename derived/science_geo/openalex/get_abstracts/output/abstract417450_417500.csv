However, the mechanism involved in this hierarchical pattern of disease progression is unknown. We describe a transgenic mouse model in which overexpression of human tau P301L is restricted to EC-II. Tau pathology progresses from EC transgene-expressing neurons to neurons without detectable transgene expression, first to EC neighboring cells, followed by propagation to neurons downstream in the synaptic circuit such as the dentate gyrus, CA fields of the hippocampus, and cingulate cortex. Human tau protein spreads to these regions and coaggregates with endogenous mouse tau. With age, synaptic degeneration occurs in the entorhinal target zone and EC neurons are lost. These data suggest that a sequence of progressive misfolding of tau proteins, circuit-based transfer to new cell populations, and deafferentation induced degeneration are part of a process of tau-induced neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2118071133,"Whole-genome sequencing of neuroblastoma, a childhood tumour of the nervous system, shows that chromothripsis (a local shredding of chromosomes) and mutations in genes regulating neurite growth are associated with the most aggressive tumours. Whole-genome sequencing is used here to identify genetic defects in 87 people with neuroblastoma, a childhood tumour of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. Analyses revealed few recurrent amino-acid-changing mutations, but a series of genes functioning in neuritogenesis and extension of neuronal growth cones were deleted in aggressive high-stage tumours. Chromothripsis, the localized shattering of the chromosomes, was common in high-stage tumours and was generally associated with poor prognosis. Neuroblastoma is a childhood tumour of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. The pathogenesis has for a long time been quite enigmatic, as only very few gene defects were identified in this often lethal tumour1. Frequently detected gene alterations are limited to MYCN amplification (20%) and ALK activations (7%)2,3,4,5. Here we present a whole-genome sequence analysis of 87 neuroblastoma of all stages. Few recurrent amino-acid-changing mutations were found. In contrast, analysis of structural defects identified a local shredding of chromosomes, known as chromothripsis, in 18% of high-stage neuroblastoma6. These tumours are associated with a poor outcome. Structural alterations recurrently affected ODZ3, PTPRD and CSMD1, which are involved in neuronal growth cone stabilization7,8,9. In addition, ATRX, TIAM1 and a series of regulators of the Rac/Rho pathway were mutated, further implicating defects in neuritogenesis in neuroblastoma. Most tumours with defects in these genes were aggressive high-stage neuroblastomas, but did not carry MYCN amplifications. The genomic landscape of neuroblastoma therefore reveals two novel molecular defects, chromothripsis and neuritogenesis gene alterations, which frequently occur in high-risk tumours."

To ascertain whether young and old GCs perform distinct memory functions, we created a transgenic mouse in which output of old GCs was specifically inhibited while leaving a substantial portion of young GCs intact. These mice exhibited enhanced or normal pattern separation between similar contexts, which was reduced following ablation of young GCs. Furthermore, these mutant mice exhibited deficits in rapid pattern completion. Therefore, pattern separation requires adult-born young GCs but not old GCs, and older GCs contribute to the rapid recall by pattern completion. Our data suggest that as adult-born GCs age, their function switches from pattern separation to rapid pattern completion.

It allows the formation of distinct memories of similar episodes by generating distinct representations of the temporal and spatial relationships comprising the events (pattern separation). This ability of the hippocampus is critical because many episodes we experience daily have similarities, but it is often important to memorize distinct features of a particular episode. The hippocampus is also involved in the recall of previously acquired memories by reactivating the full representations of those memories using partial information as recall cues (pattern completion). This ability of the hippocampus is also important because in real life, specific episodes are rarely replicated in full. These mnemonic requirements have been suggested to be subserved by specific hippocampal subregions and circuits (Figure 1A ). For pattern completion, synaptic transmission and plasticity in the recurrent network of CA3 have been proposed to play a crucial role on a theoretical basis (Marr, 1971Marr D.

Conversely, synaptic transmission and plasticity in the feed-forward pathway from the entorhinal cortex (EC) → dentate gyrus (DG) → CA3 have been implicated in pattern separation based on the spatial and temporal segregation of the initially overlapping EC memory engrams (Marr, 1971Marr D.

This hypothesis has been supported by impairments observed in rodents with DG lesions (Gilbert et al., 2001Gilbert P.E. Kesner R.P. Lee I.

These theoretical and experimental studies, however, did not consider the heterogeneity of DG GCs where most GCs (∼95%) are generated early during development and do not divide thereafter throughout the animal's life (developmentally born neurons) (Schlessinger et al., 1975Schlessinger A.R.

However, the DG also contains neural progenitor cells that generate GCs throughout life (adult-born neurons), which compose the remaining ∼5% of the total GCs in adult animals (Altman and Das, 1965Altman J.

These studies left unanswered the function of the vast majority of the GCs generated developmentally. Are they also involved in pattern separation as the theories and earlier experiments suggested? Another unanswered question concerns the age of adult-born GCs. These cells are highly active during the first few weeks after functional integration into the neuronal network (young GCs; Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2004Schmidt-Hieber C. Jonas P. Bischofberger J. Enhanced synaptic plasticity in newly generated granule cells of the adult hippocampus.Nature. 2004; 429: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, Ge et al., 2007Ge S. Yang C.-H. Hsu K.-S.

A critical period for enhanced synaptic plasticity in newly generated neurons of the adult brain.Neuron. 2007; 54: 559-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) but become less active thereafter and functionally indistinguishable from the old developmentally born GCs (together, old GCs; Laplagne et al., 2006Laplagne D.A. Espósito M.S. Piatti V.C. Morgenstern N.A. Zhao C. van Praag H. Gage F.H. Schinder A.F. Functional convergence of neurons generated in the developing and adult hippocampus.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e409Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The previous studies did not specify which of the two subsets of adult-born GCs (young or old, or both) is responsible for pattern separation. To investigate these issues, we created a transgenic mouse in which output of old GCs was specifically inhibited by the tetanus toxin (TeTX) while young GCs (up to 3 to 4 weeks old) were left intact and used context- or space-discriminating memory tasks to examine the pattern separation capability of these mice. These mice exhibited normal or enhanced pattern separation capability between similar contexts that was significantly reduced following removal of young GCs by X-ray irradiation. Contrary to expectations, mutant mice (no X-ray irradiation) displayed deficits in rapid pattern completion-mediated memory recall. Triple-transgenic DG-TeTX mouse and the triple-transgenic DG-green fluorescent protein (GFP) mouse were generated using the DICE-K method (Nakashiba et al., 2008Nakashiba T. Young J.Z. McHugh T.J. Buhl D.L. Tonegawa S. Transgenic inhibition of synaptic transmission reveals role of CA3 output in hippocampal learning.Science. 2008; 319: 1260-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). In the model mouse raised on doxycycline (Dox) followed by a 2 week Dox withdrawal, GFP was expressed robustly and exclusively in the DG throughout the septotemporal axis (Figures S1A and S1B available online). GFP expression was detected in the DG GC layer, the DG molecular layer, and the lucidum of CA3, corresponding to the location of GC dendrites and mossy fibers (MFs), respectively (Figures 1C–1E). GFP expression was repressed under Dox-on conditions (Figure 1F), activated under Dox-on-off conditions (Figure 1G), and re-repressed under Dox-on-off-on conditions (Figure 1H), in which mice were returned to a Dox diet for 3 weeks after 2 weeks of Dox withdrawal. VAMP2's immunoreactivity (IR) can be used as a criterion for transmission at MF-CA3 synapses. VAMP2 IR patterns were indistinguishable between the DG-TeTX and control mice (all control mice are of the Tg1×Tg3-TeTX genotype) kept on Dox (Figures 1I and 1J). After 4 weeks of Dox withdrawal, VAMP2 IR was greatly reduced selectively in the stratum (s.) lucidum in DG-TeTX mice (Figure 1K), suggesting an inhibition of synaptic transmission at MF terminals. VAMP2 IR was restored to control levels following a 4 week Dox-on period (Figure 1L). Synaptic transmission at MF, perforant path (PP), and recurrent (RC) inputs in slices from repressed DG-TeTX and control mice were indistinguishable (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2D ). In contrast, slices from activated DG-TeTX mice exhibited severely impaired MF transmission but normal PP and RC transmission (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2D). Importantly, MF excitability was comparable between control, repressed, and activated DG-TeTX mice (Figure S2), confirming that the impaired MF transmission observed in the DG-TeTX mice reflects a deficit in release rather than inefficient fiber stimulation. In contrast to the robust potentiation observed in slices from control and repressed DG-TeTX mice, MF transmission remained barely detectable in slices from activated DG-TeTX mice even when release probability was enhanced with forskolin (Weisskopf et al., 1994Weisskopf M.G. Castillo P.E. Zalutsky R.A. Nicoll R.A. Mediation of hippocampal mossy fiber long-term potentiation by cyclic AMP.Science. 1994; 265: 1878-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). As with VAMP2 IR, MF transmission was completely restored in slices from re-repressed DG-TeTX mice (Figures 2A and 2B). Considered together, the ex vivo VAMP2 IR and in vitro field recording data indicate that MF synaptic transmission in DG-TeTX mice is robustly inhibited by the loss of vesicle fusion selectively at MF terminals in an inducible and reversible manner. Importantly, no detectable abnormalities were found in the cytoarchitecture of MF projections or the hippocampus in activated DG-TeTX mice (Figures S1C and S1D).Figure S2MF Excitability Is Normal in Activated DG-TeTX Mice, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) Afferent fiber volley (AFV) plotted as a function of stimulus strength for MF inputs in control ACSF (A) or in the presence of forskolin (B).(C and D) Same as (A), but for PP inputs (C) and RC inputs (D).

Note that these curves were generated by analysis of recordings used to monitor fEPSP data presented in Figures 2A–2D. The lack of any significant difference across genotype/condition (p > 0.05, t test) indicates that the deficit in MF transmission of activated DG-TeTX mice (Figures 2A and 2B) is not due to a failure of action potential propagation through the MF pathway or the stimulation of fewer fibers.Data represent mean ± SEM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A and B) Afferent fiber volley (AFV) plotted as a function of stimulus strength for MF inputs in control ACSF (A) or in the presence of forskolin (B).

Data represent mean ± SEM. The generation and survival of adult-born GCs were normal in activated adult DG-TeTX mice (Figures S3A–S3C ). Moreover, the differentiation of neural progenitor cells in activated DG-TeTX mice produced normal proportions of GCs and glia (Figures S3D–S3G). A genetically engineered Moloney viral vector (Figure 3A ) was injected into the DGs of activated DG-TeTX mice and control littermates to selectively label MF boutons from adult-born GCs (van Praag et al., 2002van Praag H. Schinder A.F. Christie B.R. Toni N. Palmer T.D. Gage F.H. Functional neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus.Nature. 2002; 415: 1030-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar) and examine whether the transmissions at these synapses are inhibited (Figure 3B). Three weeks after the viral injection (Figures 3C and 3D), numerous mCherry-fused VAMP2-positive puncta (mCheV2, red) appeared in CA3 s. lucidum (where MFs should synapse onto CA3 cells). These puncta were superimposed nearly perfectly with GFP-fused synaptophysin (SypGFP, green) in both activated DG-TeTX mice and control littermates, with no discernable difference between the two genotypes. Conversely, 6 weeks after the injection (Figure 3E), the proportion of SypGFP-positive puncta colocalized with mCheV2 was substantially reduced in only the activated DG-TeTX mice. A gradual decrease of this proportion over the ages of the adult-born GCs was observed (Figure 3F), suggesting that synaptic transmission at MF terminals of young adult-born GCs (up to 3 weeks old) was relatively intact, although it gradually decreased as the cells became older (Figure 3F). This conclusion was supported by the lack of GFP expression in the adult-born doublecortin (DCX)-positive GCs (a marker for up to 3-week-old cells) (Nacher et al., 2001Nacher J. Crespo C. McEwen B.S.

To examine synaptic inputs to young (3-week-old) adult-born GCs, we injected another Moloney virus (Figure 4A , Virus 1A) and an engineered rabies virus (Figure 4B, Virus 2) (Wickersham et al., 2007Wickersham I.R.

In a control hippocampal section, nearly all GFP-positive (i.e., TVA- and rabies G-positive) young adult-born GCs had red fluorescent protein (RFP) signal derived from Virus 2 as a result of direct interaction between EnvA and TVA (Figure 4C). With the complementation of rabies G in the GFP-positive GCs, monosynaptic retrograde labeling occurred extensively in the hilar region and sparsely in CA3, where the RFP signal never overlapped with GFP, excluding the possibility of direct Virus 2 infection into those cells (Figure 4C). RFP signal was also detected in NeuN-positive neurons of EC superficial layer II with dendrites extending toward layer I (Figures 4E and 4G). RFP signal was rarely detected in cells other than GFP-positive GCs when rabies G was not provided by a Moloney virus (Figure 4A, Virus 1B), further confirming the specificity of retrograde labeling (Figures 4D and 4F). In activated DG-TeTX mice, there was no discernable difference from control mice in brain areas where cells were retrogradely labeled from young 3-week-old adult-born GCs (Figures 4C, 4E, and 4G), indicating that young adult-born GCs in DG-TeTX mice receive synaptic inputs. We compared the intrinsic membrane and synaptic properties of young adult-born GCs in control and activated DG-TeTX mice. Mice (3 to 4 months old) were infected with Moloney virus encoding GFP and sacrificed 3–4 weeks later for whole-cell patch clamp recordings from GFP-labeled GCs in acute hippocampal slices (Figures 2E–2I).

Here we describe and validate a fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based protocol that can be used with adult mouse ovaries and human ovarian cortical tissue to purify rare mitotically active cells that have a gene expression profile that is consistent with primitive germ cells. Once established in vitro, these cells can be expanded for months and can spontaneously generate 35- to 50-μm oocytes, as determined by morphology, gene expression and haploid (1n) status. Injection of the human germline cells, engineered to stably express GFP, into human ovarian cortical biopsies leads to formation of follicles containing GFP-positive oocytes 1-2 weeks after xenotransplantation into immunodeficient female mice. Thus, ovaries of reproductive-age women, similar to adult mice, possess rare mitotically active germ cells that can be propagated in vitro as well as generate oocytes in vitro and in vivo."

Here, we describe the first human disorder, thrombocytopenia with absent radii (TAR), caused by deficiency in one of the four EJC subunits. Compound inheritance of a rare null allele and one of two low-frequency SNPs in the regulatory regions of RBM8A, encoding the Y14 subunit of EJC, causes TAR. We found that this inheritance mechanism explained 53 of 55 cases (P < 5 × 10(-228)) of the rare congenital malformation syndrome. Of the 53 cases with this inheritance pattern, 51 carried a submicroscopic deletion of 1q21.1 that has previously been associated with TAR, and two carried a truncation or frameshift null mutation in RBM8A. We show that the two regulatory SNPs result in diminished RBM8A transcription in vitro and that Y14 expression is reduced in platelets from individuals with TAR. Our data implicate Y14 insufficiency and, presumably, an EJC defect as the cause of TAR syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1995717532,"Following damage to peripheral nerves, a remarkable process of clearance and regeneration takes place. Axons downstream of the injury degenerate, while the nerve is remodeled to direct axonal regrowth. Schwann cells are important for this regenerative process. ""Sensing"" damaged axons, they dedifferentiate to a progenitor-like state, in which they aid nerve regeneration. Here, we demonstrate that activation of an inducible Raf-kinase transgene in myelinated Schwann cells is sufficient to control this plasticity by inducing severe demyelination in the absence of axonal damage, with the period of demyelination/ataxia determined by the duration of Raf activation. Remarkably, activation of Raf-kinase also induces much of the inflammatory response important for nerve repair, including breakdown of the blood-nerve barrier and the influx of inflammatory cells. This reversible in vivo model identifies a central role for ERK signaling in Schwann cells in orchestrating nerve repair and is a powerful system for studying peripheral neuropathies and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2130997052,"Multimodal objects and events activate many sensory cortical areas simultaneously. This is possibly reflected in reciprocal modulations of neuronal activity, even at the level of primary cortical areas. However, the synaptic character of these interareal interactions, and their impact on synaptic and behavioral sensory responses are unclear. Here, we found that activation of auditory cortex by a noise burst drove local GABAergic inhibition on supragranular pyramids of the mouse primary visual cortex, via cortico-cortical connections. This inhibition was generated by sound-driven excitation of a limited number of cells in infragranular visual cortical neurons. Consequently, visually driven synaptic and spike responses were reduced upon bimodal stimulation. Also, acoustic stimulation suppressed conditioned behavioral responses to a dim flash, an effect that was prevented by acute blockade of GABAergic transmission in visual cortex. Thus, auditory cortex activation by salient stimuli degrades potentially distracting sensory processing in visual cortex by recruiting local, translaminar, inhibitory circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2128593336,"Schizophrenia patients suffer from severe cognitive deficits, such as impaired reality monitoring. Reality monitoring is the ability to distinguish the source of internal experiences from outside reality. During reality monitoring tasks, schizophrenia patients make errors identifying ""I made it up"" items, and even during accurate performance, they show abnormally low activation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region that supports self-referential cognition. We administered 80 hr of computerized training of cognitive processes to schizophrenia patients and found improvement in reality monitoring that correlated with increased mPFC activity. In contrast, patients in a computer games control condition did not show any behavioral or neural improvements. Notably, recovery in mPFC activity after training was associated with improved social functioning 6 months later. These findings demonstrate that a serious behavioral deficit in schizophrenia, and its underlying neural dysfunction, can be improved by well-designed computerized cognitive training, resulting in better quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2020725656,"Brain malformations are individually rare but collectively common causes of developmental disabilities. Many forms of malformation occur sporadically and are associated with reduced reproductive fitness, pointing to a causative role for de novo mutations. Here, we report a study of Baraitser-Winter syndrome, a well-defined disorder characterized by distinct craniofacial features, ocular colobomata and neuronal migration defect. Using whole-exome sequencing of three proband-parent trios, we identified de novo missense changes in the cytoplasmic actin-encoding genes ACTB and ACTG1 in one and two probands, respectively. Sequencing of both genes in 15 additional affected individuals identified disease-causing mutations in all probands, including two recurrent de novo alterations (ACTB, encoding p.Arg196His, and ACTG1, encoding p.Ser155Phe). Our results confirm that trio-based exome sequencing is a powerful approach to discover genes causing sporadic developmental disorders, emphasize the overlapping roles of cytoplasmic actin proteins in development and suggest that Baraitser-Winter syndrome is the predominant phenotype associated with mutation of these two genes."
https://openalex.org/W2036157234,"Bjarne Udd and colleagues show that mutations affecting the cytoplasmic functions of the co-chaperone DNAJB6 result in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Their studies suggest that the mutations reduce the protective anti-aggregation effects of DNAJB6, leading to protein accumulation and autophagic pathology. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1D (LGMD1D) was linked to chromosome 7q36 over a decade ago1, but its genetic cause has remained elusive. Here we studied nine LGMD-affected families from Finland, the United States and Italy and identified four dominant missense mutations leading to p.Phe93Leu or p.Phe89Ile changes in the ubiquitously expressed co-chaperone DNAJB6. Functional testing in vivo showed that the mutations have a dominant toxic effect mediated specifically by the cytoplasmic isoform of DNAJB6. In vitro studies demonstrated that the mutations increase the half-life of DNAJB6, extending this effect to the wild-type protein, and reduce its protective anti-aggregation effect. Further, we show that DNAJB6 interacts with members of the CASA complex, including the myofibrillar myopathy–causing protein BAG3. Our data identify the genetic cause of LGMD1D, suggest that its pathogenesis is mediated by defective chaperone function and highlight how mutations in a ubiquitously expressed gene can exert effects in a tissue-, isoform- and cellular compartment–specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2028941546,"Cellular senescence is a tumour-suppressor mechanism that is triggered by cancer-initiating or promoting events in mammalian cells. The molecular underpinnings for this stable arrest involve transcriptional repression of proliferation-promoting genes regulated by the retinoblastoma (RB1)/E2F repressor complex. Here, we demonstrate that AGO2, RB1 and microRNAs (miRNAs), as exemplified here by let-7, physically and functionally interact to repress RB1/E2F-target genes in senescence, a process that we call senescence-associated transcriptional gene silencing (SA-TGS). Herein, AGO2 acts as the effector protein for let-7-directed implementation of silent-state chromatin modifications at target promoters, and inhibition of the let-7/AGO2 effector complex perturbs the timely execution of senescence. Thus, we identify cellular senescence as the an endogenous signal of miRNA/AGO2-mediated TGS in human cells. Our results suggest that miRNA/AGO2-mediated SA-TGS may contribute to tumour suppression by stably repressing proliferation-promoting genes in premalignant cancer cells."

Sollid and his colleagues provide an unbiased and thorough characterization of the mucosal antibody response directly from the effector compartment. They report that TG2-specific plasma cells are expanded in the duodenal mucosa of individuals with celiac disease. Antibodies cloned from these cells are of high affinity, show a restricted repertoire and minimal somatic hypermutation, and do not inhibit TG2 enzymatic activity. Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder in which mucosal autoantibodies to the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2)1 are generated in response to the exogenous antigen gluten2 in individuals who express human leukocyte antigen HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 (ref. 3). We assessed in a comprehensive and nonbiased manner the IgA anti-TG2 response by expression cloning of the antibody repertoire of ex vivo–isolated intestinal antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). We found that TG2-specific plasma cells are markedly expanded within the duodenal mucosa in individuals with active celiac disease. TG2-specific antibodies were of high affinity yet showed little adaptation by somatic mutations. Unlike infection-induced peripheral blood plasmablasts4, the TG2-specific ASCs had not recently proliferated and were not short-lived ex vivo. Altogether, these observations demonstrate that there is a germline repertoire with high affinity for TG2 that may favor massive generation of autoreactive B cells. TG2-specific antibodies did not block enzymatic activity and served as substrates for TG2-mediated crosslinking when expressed as IgD or IgM but not as IgA1 or IgG1. This could result in preferential recruitment of plasma cells from naive IgD- and IgM-expressing B cells, thus possibly explaining why the antibody response to TG2 bears signs of a primary immune response despite the disease chronicity."

The approach was shown to effectively label three types of stem cells and two types of immune cells. We report on a new straightforward magnetic cell-labeling approach that combines three US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs—ferumoxytol, heparin and protamine—in serum-free medium to form self-assembling nanocomplexes that effectively label cells for in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We observed that the ferumoxytol-heparin-protamine (HPF) nanocomplexes were stable in serum-free cell culture medium. HPF nanocomplexes show a threefold increase in T2 relaxivity compared to ferumoxytol. Electron microscopy showed internalized HPF in endosomes, which we confirmed by Prussian blue staining of labeled cells. There was no long-term effect or toxicity on cellular physiology or function of HPF-labeled hematopoietic stem cells, bone marrow stromal cells, neural stem cells or T cells when compared to controls.

When cAMP binds a regulatory motif, it causes a conformational change of EPAC proteins and hence activates a Ras-like small GTPase Rap1/2 (Rehmann et al., 2003Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E.

Both EPAC1 and EPAC2 genes are expressed throughout the brain including the hippocampus, striatum, and prefrontal cortex (Kawasaki et al., 1998Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S.

But, their neurological functions are yet to be described. In this study, we report that both EPAC1−/− and EPAC2−/− mice are phenotypically normal while double knockout (EPAC−/−) mice exhibit severe deficits in LTP, spatial learning, and social interactions, showing functional redundancy of EPAC proteins in the brain in vivo. Additionally, we identify that EPAC proteins via activation of Rap1 directly interacts with the regulatory element upstream of miR-124 gene and restricts miR-124. We further show that miR-124 directly binds to and inhibits Zif268 translation. These findings reveal an unexpected mechanism by which the mutation of EPAC genes cause cognition and social dysfunctions. Thus, targeting these genes can be considered as a promising strategy for the treatment of some neurological disorders. EPAC1 and EPAC2 proteins are very similar and expressed in largely overlapping patterns throughout the brain (Kawasaki et al., 1998Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. A family of cAMP-binding proteins that directly activate Rap1.Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar), suggesting functional redundancy. To test this idea and explore the in vivo functions of EPAC1 and EPAC2 proteins in the brain, we genetically deleted EPAC1 (EPAC1−/−, Figures 1A–1C ) or EPAC2 (EPAC2−/−, Figures 1D and 1E) or both EPAC1 and EPAC2 genes in the forebrain of mice (EPAC−/−, see Experimental Procedures and Figure 1F). A complete gene deletion in the null alleles was confirmed by RT-PCR and western blot analysis of EPAC1 (Figures 1C and 1F) or EPAC2 (Figures 1E and 1F) mRNA and proteins. Additionally, we demonstrated that a combined deletion of both EPAC1 and EPAC2 genes inactivated the GEFs for Rap1, whereas a single gene deletion (EPAC1−/− or EPAC2−/−) alone had no effect (Figures 1G and 1H), showing a synergistic action between EPAC1 and EPAC2 proteins. We next examined whether EPAC null mutation caused developmental changes or alterations in synaptic structures. We compared the overall synaptic protein compositions (Figure 1I), synaptic spines (Figure 1J), and spine densities (Figure 1K) as well as synaptic vesicles (Figure 1L) among genotypes; we discovered no abnormalities in EPAC−/− alleles. In contrast to our findings, an earlier study suggested that EPAC2 protein was involved in synaptic remodeling via regulation of spine turnover (Woolfrey et al., 2009Woolfrey K.M. Srivastava D.P. Photowala H. Yamashita M. Barbolina M.V. Cahill M.E. Xie Z. Jones K.A. Quilliam L.A. Prakriya M. Penzes P. Epac2 induces synapse remodeling and depression and its disease-associated forms alter spines.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, this previous work was conducted in the in vitro cultured neurons and thus relevance to the in vivo neuronal functions of endogenous EPAC2 protein is questionable. Additionally, we analyzed the series cryostat brain sections (Figures S1A and S1B, available online) from adult mice. As shown for regions (Figure S1C) including the hippocampus, striatum, and the prefrontal cortex known to express EPAC genes, there were no structural deficits in EPAC−/− neurons. We next examined whether EPAC null mutation affects functional state of synapses. We used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from the CA1 pyramidal neurons blind, with direct comparison of littermates derived from heterozygous mating. In this series of the studies, we first analyzed the evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) by stimulation of the Schaffer-collateral fibers. Since the peak amplitude of EPSCs at a given stimulation varies from slice to slice, we constructed the input-output curves by plotting the normalized EPSCs amplitude against the stimulus intensities. We found that the evoked EPSCs in response to the elevated stimulus intensities were dramatically reduced in EPAC−/− and inducible (IN-EPAC−/−) neurons, compared to controls (Figure 2A , n = 16 recordings/8 mice). We also examined the spontaneous release of glutamate transmitter (Figure 2B) and demonstrated that the frequency (Figure 2C) but not the mean amplitude (Figure 2D) of the spontaneous EPSCs in EPAC null alleles decreased significantly, compared to the controls (n = 14 recordings/7 mice/group, p < 0.01). In the postsynaptic sites, we analyzed the current-voltage (I-V) relations of the normalized AMPA receptor-mediated (Figure 2E) and NMDA receptor-mediated (Figure 2F) EPSCs. We found that neither the voltage dependence nor the reversal potentials of the evoked EPSCs were altered in EPAC−/− neurons (n = 12 recordings/6 mice/group). Collectively, these findings indicate that EPAC null mutation reduces glutamate release from presynaptic terminals without altering the receptor channel conductance on the postsynaptic sites. To extend analysis of synaptic functions, we examined whether LTP, an activity-dependent long-lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission (Nicoll and Malenka, 1995Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Contrasting properties of two forms of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.Nature. 1995; 377: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), was altered in EPAC null alleles. In this study, we performed the intracellular sharp electrode recordings of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons. We observed that brief high-frequency stimulation (tetanus) increased the peak amplitudes of the evoked EPSPs in control littermates. This increase (LTP) was maintained over 90 min (Figures 2G and 2H, 1.78 ± 0.15, n = 12 recordings/6 mice/group). In EPAC−/− neurons, however, a short-term enhancement but not LTP was found; the peak amplitudes decayed to the basal levels after 30 min of the tetanus (1.05 ± 0.71, n = 14 recordings/7 mice/group, p < 0.01). Similar to CA1 pyramidal neurons, an absence of LTP was observed in the EPAC−/− granule cells (Figure 2H). LTP deficits in EPAC−/− cells was not due to the developmental abnormalities because it was found in the inducible EPAC−/− mice (IN-EPAC−/−), in which EPAC1 gene was deleted after development was completed (1.09 ± 0.79 in CA1 and 1.11 ± 0.68 in the dentate granule cells, respectively; Figures 2G and 2H). It should be mentioned that there was a reduction of synaptic strength in EPAC−/− neurons in response to the elevated stimulus intensities under the basal condition (Figure 2A). Thus, the failure expression of LTP in EPAC−/− mice could be a functional consequence of a general synaptic deficit. To investigate this possibility, we examined the capacity of EPAC−/− neurons for LTD expression by applying 300 stimuli over the course of 3 min. We found that the magnitude of LTD did not differ among groups (Figure 2I). Thus, EPAC null mutation specifically impairs LTP. LTP of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus is widely considered as a cellular substrate of spatial learning and memory formation (Nicoll and Malenka, 1995Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Contrasting properties of two forms of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.Nature. 1995; 377: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, Kessels and Malinow, 2009Kessels H.W. Malinow R. Synaptic AMPA receptor plasticity and behavior.Neuron. 2009; 61: 340-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether the deficits of LTP, particularly in its late phase, were paralleled with the abnormalities in spatial information acquisition. To answer this question, we carried out the Morris water maze tests. Prior to the tests, we tested the exploratory activity and locomotion of mice in the open field. We measured the floor plane movements (Figure 3A ) and vertical plane entries (i.e., rearing, Figure 3B) as well as the stereotypic behaviors (i.e., grooming, Figure 3C) and found that all parameters examined were normal in EPAC null alleles (n = 16 mice per group). We next trained adult male mice in the hidden platform version of the Morris water maze with four trials per day. Consistent with previous studies using pharmacological reagents (Ouyang et al., 2008Ouyang M. Zhang L. Zhu J.J. Schwede F. Thomas S.A. Epac signaling is required for hippocampus-dependent memory retrieval.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 11993-11997Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we found that EPAC null mutant mice had a significant longer latency and swim path length to reach the platform, compared to the other groups (Figure 3D, n = 16 mice/group, p < 0.01). At the end of the training, we placed mice for a one-day probe trial, in which the platform in the water maze was removed and mice were allowed to search the pool for 60 s. Our data demonstrated that all groups, but not EPAC null mutants, had preference searching in the targeting quadrant (Figure 3E, n = 16 mice/group), showing the spatial learning and memory deficits in EPAC null alleles. To further analyze the capacity of the spatial information acquisition, the same groups of mice were tested in the reversal water maze training, in which the hidden platform in the maze was placed to the opposite quadrant. We found that EPAC null mutants had longer latency to find new platform location (Figure 3F, n = 16 mice/group, p < 0.01) and spent less time in a newly trained quadrant (Figure 3G, n = 16 mice/group, p < 0.01). This finding indicates that EPAC null alleles had abnormal reversal learning. In the visible platform version of the water maze test, however, all mice showed the similar latencies to find the platform (Figure 3H, n = 16 mice/group, p < 0.01). Thus, the spatial learning and memory deficits were not associated with the abnormal gross performance in EPAC null alleles. EPAC genes are expressed in the hippocampus and in all other regions of the forebrain (Kawasaki et al., 1998Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. A family of cAMP-binding proteins that directly activate Rap1.Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Thus, EPAC null mutation may have effects on the other categories of behaviors. For this consideration, we examined the social approach and preference of mice for exploring two different types of stimuli (the unfamiliar mouse and the unfamiliar object) in an automated three-chamber apparatus, as previously described (Silverman et al., 2010Silverman J.L. Yang M. Lord C. Crawley J.N. Behavioural phenotyping assays for mouse models of autism.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 490-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). In this test, we used adult male mice at 90 ± 2 days old. We showed that EPAC null alleles spent only half as much time as other groups in the mouse side (Figure 3I) and in sniffing the unfamiliar mice (Figure 3J, n = 15 mice/group, p < 0.01). These data indicate that EPAC null mutation impairs the social behaviors. We next asked whether this impairment of social interactions occurs in EPAC null alleles at the younger age. We carried out the juvenile play tests using the postnatal mice at 21 days old. In each of the tests, two unfamiliar male mice were paired for 30 min sessions of play in the arena. Consistent with the social deficits observed during the adulthood, the juvenile EPAC null alleles had fewer nose-to-nose sniffing (Figure 3K, n = 18 mice per group, p < 0.01), front approach (Figure 3L, n = 18 mice per group, p < 0.01), and push/crawl (Figure 3M, n = 18 mice per group, p < 0.01) to their pairs, compared to the age-matched control mice. Spatial learning and social behaviors are a complex of physiological responses that are involved in a variety of transcriptional and translational events (Soderling and Derkach, 2000Soderling T.R.

To determine which of these events are linked with EPAC null mutation, we examined small (∼21–23 nucleotides), noncoding RNA transcripts (miRNAs), which are known to negatively regulate the learning capacities via restricting mRNA translation (Bartel, 2004Bartel D.P.

We conducted the miRNA arrays with a total of 785 probe sets to compare the expression of miRNAs in the forebrain of EPAC−/− mice with the control littermates. Combined with qPCR analysis we found a number of brain-enriched miRNAs that were significantly altered in EPAC−/− mice (Figures 4A and 4B , n = 12 assays/6 mice/group); three were massively upregulated whereas three were downregulated (Figure 4A and 4B, n = 12 assays/6 mice/group). Of these miRNAs, miR-124 is of particularly interest because of its ability to coordinate synaptic functions in memory consolidation (Rajasethupathy et al., 2009Rajasethupathy P. Fiumara F.

Ephrin-B1 reverse signaling controls a posttranscriptional feedback mechanism via miR-124.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2508-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). miR-124 binds to a complementary sequence (GUGCCU) in the mRNA 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR) and facilitates the mRNA degradation (Lim et al., 2005Lim L.P. Lau N.C. Garrett-Engele P. Grimson A. Schelter J.M. Castle J. Bartel D.P. Linsley P.S. Johnson J.M. Microarray analysis shows that some microRNAs downregulate large numbers of target mRNAs.Nature. 2005; 433: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (3786) Google Scholar). To search for the specific mRNA targets of miR-124 in EPAC−/− mice, we carried out a genome-wide gene expression analysis with 36,422 probe sets (Figure S2). We identified 11 genes that were significantly altered in EPAC−/− mice (Figure 4C, also see Figure S2). The most notable gene was Zif268, also known as Egr1; it was dramatically downregulated (Figures 4C–4F, n = 12 assays/6 mice per group). Zif268 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor essential for stabilizing synaptic plasticity and spatial learning (Hall et al., 2000Hall J. Thomas K.L. Everitt B.J.

USA. 2009; 106: 11771-11775Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Since Zif268 contains a miR-124 conserved binding site in its 3′UTR region (Figure 4G), we hypothesize that miR-124 binds directly to and inhibits Zif268 mRNA translation. To test this hypothesis, we created a wild-type 3′UTR segment and its mutant of Zif268 and placed these segments into the luciferase reporter system. When coexpressed with miR-124, a wild-type reporter showed significant inhibition (Figure 4H, n = 4), compared to its mutant, demonstrating that miR-124 directly targets to Zif268. To directly determine whether miR-124 inhibition of Zif268 mediates the EPAC−/− phenotypes, we created a saline-formulated, locked-nucleic acid-modified (LNA) antisense oligonucleotide (LNA-miR-124). As a control, we used LNA-negative (LNA-control, or control). We injected 3 μl of LNA-miR-124 (50 mg/ml) or LNA-control directly into the third ventricle of adult mice. Forty-eight hours after the injection, real-time PCR was used to analyze miR-124. We found that LNA-miR-124 induced a stable silencing of miR-124 in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, whereas LNA-control did not (Figure 4I, n = 6 assays/3 mice). Following inhibition of endogenous miR-124, Zif268 mRNA (Figure 4J, n = 6 assays/3 mice), and protein (Figures 4K and 4L, n = 6 assays/3 mice) in EPAC−/− mice were elevated to a level comparable with that in EPAC+/+ mice. Although knockdown of miR-124 produced little effect on synaptic transmission (Figure 5A , n = 10 recordings/5 mice/group), it completely restored the capacity of EPAC−/− neurons to express LTP (Figure 5B, n = 12 recordings/6 mice/group, p < 0.01) and resulted in a significant improvement of spatial learning (Figures 5C–5E, n = 16 mice/group, p < 0.01) and social interactions in both adult (Figures 5F and 5G, n = 16 mice/group, p < 0.01) and juvenile (Figure 5H, n = 18 mice/group, p < 0.01) EPAC−/− mice. Thus, LTP and the behavioral deficits observed in EPAC null alleles can be reversed by knockdown of miR-124. We next investigated whether expression of miR-124 mimics the effects of EPAC null mutation. We constructed type ½ recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV1/2) vectors to express miR-124 (rAAV1/2-miR-124, Figure 6A ). As a control, a negative miRNA sequence (GTGTAACACGTCTATACGCCCA, rAAV1/2-control, or control) was expressed. We found that expression of miR-124 in the hippocampus of EPAC+/+ mice reduced the endogenous Zif268 to a level similar to that observed in EPAC−/− mice (Figures 6B and 6C, n = 4, p < 0.01). When miR-124 was expressed in the hippocampus of EPAC−/− mice, however, there was no further decrease of Zif268 (Figure 6C, n = 4, p < 0.01), indicating that EPAC null mutation occludes the inhibitory effects of miR-124 on Zif268 translation. This inhibition was specific since expression of miR-124 had no effect on several other genes (Figure 6B, n = 6, p < 0.01), including cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived growth factor (BDNF). Importantly, we found that expression of miR-124 did not alter the basal synaptic transmission (Figures 6D and 6E, n = 12 recordings/6 mice/group), but it resulted in a loss of a late phase of LTP (Figures 6F and 6G, n = 15 recordings/5 mice/group, p < 0.01) and disrupted the spatial learning and memory (Figures 6H–6K, n = 15 mice per group, ∗p < 0.01). Notably, however, the social behaviors were normal when miR-124 was expressed in the hippocampus (Figures 6L–6N, n = 15 mice per group). It has been known that the social behaviors are largely processed in the prefrontal cortex of the brain (Walsh et al., 2008Walsh C.A. Morrow E.M. Rubenstein J.L.R. Autism and brain development.Cell. 2008; 135: 396-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Silverman et al., 2010Silverman J.L. Yang M. Lord C. Crawley J.N. Behavioural phenotyping assays for mouse models of autism.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 490-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). We thus expressed miR-124 in this region by injection of the rAAV1/2-miR-124/eGFP virus particles and found it did cause the social behavioral deficits (Figures 6L–6N, n = 15 mice per group). Significantly, miR-124 phenotypes including the deficits of LTP (Figure 6G, n = 12 recordings/6 mice/group, p < 0.01), spatial learning (Figures 6H–6K, n = 15 mice per groups), and social behaviors (Figures 6L–6N, n = 15 mice per groups) can be reproduced by knockdown of endogenous Zif268 using LNA-Zif268 antisense (Figure S3, n = 13 mice per groups). Together, these results demonstrate that miR-124 transcription mediates the EPAC effects in regulation of LTP, spatial learning, and social interactions by controlling Zif268 translation. EPAC proteins activate Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (de Rooij et al., 1998de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2084194517,"Myelination by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) is essential for proper brain function, yet the molecular determinants that control this process remain poorly understood. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors Olig1 and Olig2 promote myelination, whereas bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibit myelination. Here we show that these opposing regulators of myelination are functionally linked by the Olig1/2 common target Smad-interacting protein-1 (Sip1). We demonstrate that Sip1 is an essential modulator of CNS myelination. Sip1 represses differentiation inhibitory signals by antagonizing BMP receptor-activated Smad activity while activating crucial oligodendrocyte-promoting factors. Importantly, a key Sip1-activated target, Smad7, is required for oligodendrocyte differentiation and partially rescues differentiation defects caused by Sip1 loss. Smad7 promotes myelination by blocking the BMP- and β-catenin-negative regulatory pathways. Thus, our findings reveal that Sip1-mediated antagonism of inhibitory signaling is critical for promoting CNS myelination and point to new mediators for myelin repair."

The network analysis uncovers RUNX1 as a key mediator of the effects of TLX factors and, consistently, mutations in RUNX1 are found in human T-ALL. The TLX1 and TLX3 transcription factor oncogenes have a key role in the pathogenesis of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)1,2. Here we used reverse engineering of global transcriptional networks to decipher the oncogenic regulatory circuit controlled by TLX1 and TLX3. This systems biology analysis defined T cell leukemia homeobox 1 (TLX1) and TLX3 as master regulators of an oncogenic transcriptional circuit governing T-ALL. Notably, a network structure analysis of this hierarchical network identified RUNX1 as a key mediator of the T-ALL induced by TLX1 and TLX3 and predicted a tumor-suppressor role for RUNX1 in T cell transformation. Consistent with these results, we identified recurrent somatic loss-of-function mutations in RUNX1 in human T-ALL. Overall, these results place TLX1 and TLX3 at the top of an oncogenic transcriptional network controlling leukemia development, show the power of network analyses to identify key elements in the regulatory circuits governing human cancer and identify RUNX1 as a tumor-suppressor gene in T-ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2030771734,"Environmental enrichment causes a variety of effects on brain structure and function. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in enrichment-induced neuronal changes; however, the precise mechanism underlying these effects remains uncertain. In this study, a specific upregulation of kinesin superfamily motor protein 1A (KIF1A) was observed in the hippocampi of mice kept in an enriched environment and, in hippocampal neurons in vitro, BDNF increased the levels of KIF1A and of KIF1A-mediated cargo transport. Analysis of Bdnf+/− and Kif1a+/− mice revealed that a lack of KIF1A upregulation resulted in a loss of enrichment-induced hippocampal synaptogenesis and learning enhancement. Meanwhile, KIF1A overexpression promoted synaptogenesis via the formation of presynaptic boutons. These findings demonstrate that KIF1A is indispensable for BDNF-mediated hippocampal synaptogenesis and learning enhancement induced by enrichment. This is a new molecular motor-mediated presynaptic mechanism underlying experience-dependent neuroplasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2006535542,"Postnatal cardiac remodeling is characterized by a marked decrease in the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) expression. The underlying mechanism remains unexplored. This study examined the role of microRNAs in postnatal cardiac remodeling. By expression profiling, we observed a 10-fold increase in miR-378 expression in 1-week-old neonatal mouse hearts compared with 16-day-old fetal hearts. There was also a 4-6-fold induction in expression of miR-378 in older (10 months) compared with younger (1 month) hearts. Interestingly, tissue distribution analysis identified miR-378 to be highly abundant in heart and skeletal muscles. In the heart, specific expression was observed in cardiac myocytes, which was inducible by a variety of stressors. Overexpression of miR-378 enhanced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes by direct targeting of IGF1R and reduced signaling in Akt cascade. The inhibition of miR-378 by its anti-miR protected cardiomyocytes against H(2)O(2) and hypoxia reoxygenation-induced cell death by promoting IGF1R expression and downstream Akt signaling cascade. Additionally, our data show that miR-378 expression is inhibited by IGF1 in cardiomyocytes. In tissues such as fibroblasts and fetal hearts, where IGF1 levels are high, we found either absent or significantly low miR-378 levels, suggesting an inverse relationship between these two factors. Our study identifies miR-378 as a new cardioabundant microRNA that targets IGF1R. We also demonstrate the existence of a negative feedback loop between miR-378, IGF1R, and IGF1 that is associated with postnatal cardiac remodeling and with the regulation of cardiomyocyte survival during stress."
https://openalex.org/W2013955369,"Studying specific cellular responses elicited by compartmented cAMP signals in real time has been difficult. A new method called SMICUS overcomes this challenge and reveals a resident pool of nuclear PKA that can convert cAMP signals to rapid responses. Understanding how specific cyclic AMP (cAMP) signals are organized and relayed to their effectors in different compartments of the cell to achieve functional specificity requires molecular tools that allow precise manipulation of cAMP in these compartments. Here we characterize a new method using bicarbonate-activatable and genetically targetable soluble adenylyl cyclase to control the location, kinetics and magnitude of the cAMP signal. Using this live-cell cAMP manipulation in conjunction with fluorescence imaging and mechanistic modeling, we uncovered the activation of a resident pool of protein kinase A (PKA) holoenzyme in the nuclei of HEK-293 cells, modifying the existing dogma of cAMP-PKA signaling in the nucleus. Furthermore, we show that phosphodiesterases and A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) are critical in shaping nuclear PKA responses. Collectively, our data suggest a new model in which AKAP-localized phosphodiesterases tune an activation threshold for nuclear PKA holoenzyme, thereby converting spatially distinct second messenger signals to temporally controlled nuclear kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2083903194,"In our previous work, we showed for the first time that the voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 is specifically expressed in highly metastatic human breast tumor tissues and cell lines. However, the contribution of Hv1 to breast carcinogenesis is not well known. In this study, we showed that Hv1 expression was significantly correlated with the tumor size (p = 0.001), tumor classification (p = 0.000), lymph node status (p = 0.000), clinical stage (p = 0.000), and Her-2 status (p = 0.045). High Hv1 expression was associated significantly with shorter overall (p = 0.000) and recurrence-free survival (p = 0.000). In vitro, knockdown of Hv1 expression in the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells decreased the cell proliferation and invasiveness, inhibited the cell proton secretion and intracellular pH recovery, and blocked the cell capacity of acidifying extracellular milieu. Furthermore, the gelatinase activity in MDA-MB-231 cells that suppressed Hv1 was reduced. In vivo, the breast tumor size of the implantation of the MDA-MB-231 xenografts in nude mice that were knocked down by Hv1 was dramatically smaller than that in the control groups. The results demonstrated that the inhibition of Hv1 function via knockdown of Hv1 expression can effectively retard the cancer growth and suppress the cancer metastasis by the decrease of proton extrusion and the down-regulation of gelatinase activity.

A voltage sensor-domain protein is a voltage-gated proton channel.Science. 2006; 312: 589-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Hv1 in mammalian phagocytes is proposed to be responsible for the proton-transporting pathway, which regulates intracellular pH during oxygen consumption associated with phagocytosis, called “respiratory burst” (12Decoursey T.E. Voltage-gated proton channels and other proton transfer pathways.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 475-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 13Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T. The superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase of human neutrophils is electrogenic and associated with an H+ channel.Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Hv1 is activated by depolarization and intracellular acidification, whose activities maintain neutral intracellular pH to keep the reactive oxygen species generation (14Clark R.A. Leidal K.G. Pearson D.W. Nauseef W.M. NADPH oxidase of human neutrophils. Subcellular localization and characterization of an arachidonate-activatable superoxide-generating system.J. Biol.

Physiol. 2005; 569: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hv1 not only regulates pH in cytoplasm but could also provide protons in the phagosome, a closed membrane compartment for killing and digestion of a pathogen (12Decoursey T.E. Voltage-gated proton channels and other proton transfer pathways.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 475-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Hv1 is extremely selective for H+, with no detectable permeability to other cations (16DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Voltage-activated hydrogen ion currents.J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 141: 203-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 17Cherny V.V. Markin V.S. DeCoursey T.E. The voltage-activated hydrogen ion conductance in rat alveolar epithelial cells is determined by the pH gradient.J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 861-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The voltage activation relationship of Hv1 depends strongly on both pHi and pHo. Increasing pHo or lowering pHi promotes H+ channel opening by shifting the activation threshold to more negative potentials (12Decoursey T.E. Voltage-gated proton channels and other proton transfer pathways.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 475-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Hv1 current is inhibited by submillimolar concentrations of Zn2+ and Cd2+ and other divalent cations (18Cherny V.V. DeCoursey T.E. pH-dependent inhibition of voltage-gated H+ currents in rat alveolar epithelial cells by Zn2+ and other divalent cations.J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 819-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Hv1 contains three predicted domains as follows: N-terminal acid and proline-rich domain, transmembrane voltage-sensor domain (VSD), and C-terminal domain. Voltage-gated K+ channels are composed of four subunits, each of which has a pore domain and a VSD. The four pore domains come together to form one single central pore, and four peripheral VSDs control the gate of the pore (19Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Crystal structure of a mammalian voltage-dependent Shaker family K+ channel.Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). In contrast to the voltage-gated K+ channels, the Hv1 contains a VSD but lacks the pore domain. Recent studies showed that Hv1 functions as a dimer in which the intracellular C-terminal domain is responsible for the dimeric architecture of the proteins, and each subunit contains its own pore (20Koch H.P. Kurokawa T. Okochi Y. Sasaki M. Okamura Y. Larsson H.P. Multimeric nature of voltage-gated proton channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The intracellular C-terminal domain of Hv1 forms a dimer via a parallel α-helical coiled-coil and is essential for the protein localization (23Li S.J. Zhao Q. Zhou Q. Unno H. Zhai Y. Sun F.

Chem. 2010; 285: 12047-12054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our previous work showed for the first time that Hv1 is specifically expressed in highly metastatic human breast tumor tissues and cell lines (24Wang Y. Li S.J. Pan J. Che Y. Yin J. Zhao Q. Specific expression of the human voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 in highly metastatic breast cancer cells promotes tumor progression and metastasis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 412: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of Hv1 to breast carcinogenesis is still unknown. Here, we investigated the clinicopathological and biological significance of Hv1 overexpression in breast cancer. Our results demonstrated that the inhibition of Hv1 function via knockdown of Hv1 expression using RNA-interfering technology can effectively retard the cancer growth and suppress the cancer metastasis by the decrease of proton extrusion and the down-regulation of gelatinase activity and suggested that Hv1 is a potential biomarker for prognosis of breast cancer and a potential target for anticancer drugs in breast cancer therapy. Breast cancer tissue samples were obtained from patients who underwent routine curative surgery at the Department of Surgery, Tonghua Central Hospital, between 2001 and 2007. The patients were not pretreated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy prior to surgery. 105 breast cancer tissues and paired normal tissues that were taken from sites distant from the tumorous lesions, and 10 hyperplasia of breast tissues, were fixed in 10% formalin and then embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemical analysis. The clinicopathological features of these patients were shown in Table 1. Each patient's clinical status was classified according to the pathological tumor grade, tumor size, and lymph node status. Tumor differentiation was graded by the pathological Tumor-Node-Metastasis system (6th edition). This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tonghua Central Hospital, and informed consent was obtained from each patient.TABLE 1Clinicopathological parametersCharacteristicsNo. of patients (%), n = 105Age (year) median 53.2 ≤5048 (45.7) >5057 (54.3)Primary site Left breast62 (59.0) Right breast43 (41.0)Tumor size (cm) ≤226 (24.8) >279 (75.2)Tumor classification T127 (25.7) T264 (61.0) T310 (9.5) T44 (3.8)Lymph node status Negative64 (61.0) Positive41 (39.0)Clinical stage I19 (18.1) II45 (42.8) III38 (36.2) IV3 (2.9)ER status −/+85 (81.0) ++/+++20 (19.0)PR status −/+84 (80.0) ++/+++21 (20.0)Her-2 status −/+75 (71.4) ++/+++30 (28.6) Open table in a new tab A polyclonal antiserum was generated against the C-terminal domain of Hv1 (24Wang Y. Li S.J. Pan J. Che Y. Yin J. Zhao Q. Specific expression of the human voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 in highly metastatic breast cancer cells promotes tumor progression and metastasis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 412: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The protein was purified to homogeneity after being expressed in Escherichia coli (25Li S.J. Zhao Q. Zhou Q. Zhai Y. Expression, purification, crystallization, and preliminary crystallographic study of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the human voltage-gated proton channel Hv1.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2009; 65: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The purified protein was injected into mice. HRP- and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgGs were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Histological diagnoses of tumorous and nontumorous formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues were confirmed on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. Immunohistochemistry was performed with the polyclonal antiserum of Hv1. The anti-Hv1 serum was diluted 100-fold with PBST (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20) containing 1% (w/v) BSA. The paraffin-embedded sections filled with 10 mm EDTA buffer, pH 8.0, were heated in a microwave oven for 12 min. After cooling, the sections were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and exposed to 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 10 min to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity. Subsequently, the sections were incubated in PBST containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 2% BSA for 30 min to reduce nonspecific binding. Incubation with primary antibody was performed overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber. HRP-coupled anti-mouse secondary antibody was used at a final dilution of 1:400 for 1 h. Finally, the visualization signal was developed with diaminobenzidine, and the slides were counterstained in hematoxylin. Negative control was performed to treat with nonimmune mouse serum as the primary antibody instead of anti-Hv1 serum. Stained sections were evaluated in a blinded manner without prior knowledge of the clinical information using the German immunoreactive score, “ImmunoReactive Score” (IRS). Briefly, the IRS assigns sub-scores for immunoreactive distribution (0–4) and intensity (0–3) and then multiplies them to yield the IRS score. The percent positivity was scored as “0” (<5%), “1” (5–25%), “2” (25–50%), “3” (50–75%), and “4” (>75%). The staining intensity was scored according to the area of Hv1-positive staining cells as “0, −” (negative, <5%), “1, +” (weakly positive, 5–25%), “2, ++” (positive, 25–50%), and “3, +++” (strongly positive, >50%). The final Hv1 expression score was calculated with the value of percent positivity score plus staining intensity score, which ranged from 0 to 12. We estimated IRS by averaging the values in eight fields at ×500 magnification for each specimen. Intratumoral Hv1 expression was defined as follows: low expression (score 0–3) and high expression (score 4–12). Immunohistochemical analysis and scoring were performed by two independent experienced pathologists. Human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) of Hv1 lentivirus gene transfer vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence was constructed by Genechem Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China. The targeting sequence of the shRNA was 5′-CGCCAAGATTCAACACCTT-3′ and the random sense sequence was 5′-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′, both of which were confirmed by sequencing. The recombinant lentivirus of small interference RNA targeting Hv1 (Hv1-siRNA) and the control lentivirus (Hv1-scr) were prepared and titered to 109 transfection units/ml. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in 24-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) overnight. The lentiviruses were diluted in 0.25 ml (108 transfection units/ml) of serum-free medium containing Polybrene (5 mg/ml) and added to the cells for 5 h of incubation at 37 °C, followed by incubation in 0.25 ml of fresh RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS for another 5 h, which was replaced with fresh RPMI 1640 medium, and the cells were cultured for next 48 h. Cells were prepared at a concentration of 5 × 103 cells/100 μl and then distributed in 96-well plates at 100 μl/well and cultured overnight. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was performed every day for up to 6 days. 10 μl of 5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) was added to each well; the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, and the supernatants were removed carefully; 150 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well, and the plates were agitated on a shaker for 5 min. The optical density was measured with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) at 570 nm. Experiments were performed in triplicate. In vitro invasion assays were performed to assess the effects of Hv1 on the invasive ability of the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 and poorly metastatic MCF-7 cells, as described in our previous work (24Wang Y. Li S.J. Pan J. Che Y. Yin J. Zhao Q. Specific expression of the human voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 in highly metastatic breast cancer cells promotes tumor progression and metastasis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 412: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, transwells with 8-μm pore size filters (Millipore) were covered with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and inserted into a 24-well plate. RPMI 1640 medium (500 μl) containing 10% FBS was added to the lower chamber, and 200 μl of a cell suspension (5 × 104 cells) was placed in the upper chamber. The plate was incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 for 24 h. The penetrated cells were stained with crystal violet solution and photographed. Each experiment was conducted four times. MDA-MB-231 cells grown on glass coverslips at confluence in 6-well tissue culture plates were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 30 min, washed in PBS, treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min, exposed to 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 15 min, and blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum and 2% BSA in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The blocked coverslips were incubated with anti-Hv1 mouse serum at a dilution of 1:100 with PBST containing 1% (w/v) BSA at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing three times in PBS, the coverslips were further incubated with FITC-coupled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody at a final dilution of 1:400 for 1 h. The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. The images of the cells on coverslips were recorded on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscopy (LEICA, Germany) with the FITC-filter set for enhanced GFP and the DAPI filter set for the nuclear DAPI dye. The images were later processed by Adobe Photoshop software. The activities of gelatinase in the supernatants of the cultured MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were measured, as described in our previous work (24Wang Y. Li S.J. Pan J. Che Y. Yin J. Zhao Q. Specific expression of the human voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 in highly metastatic breast cancer cells promotes tumor progression and metastasis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 412: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were plated in a 24-well plate (1.5 × 105 per well) and cultured for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After the cells were washed three times with PBS and 0.5 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium was added into each well, the cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h. The medium was collected and run in 10% SDS-PAGE (containing 0.1% gelatin). The protein concentrations of the medium were determined using BCA method and to each well was added 20 μg of protein. After electrophoresis, gels were soaked for 0.5 h in the renaturing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2.5% Triton X-100, and 5 mm CaCl2) and incubated in the developing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm CaCl2) for 20 h. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The activity of Hv1 in MDA-MB-231 cells was assessed as a change in pHi in response to membrane depolarization by BCECF fluorescence (11Sasaki M. Takagi M. Okamura Y. A voltage sensor-domain protein is a voltage-gated proton channel.Science. 2006; 312: 589-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with 3.0 μm BCECF-AM (Molecular Probe) in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 30 min, respectively, and washed three times with PSS solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5). Cells were incubated with NH4Cl/N-methyl d-glucamine solution (100 mm N-methyl d-glucamine, 40 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.3) for 20 min and washed by ammonium-free solution (140 mm N-methyl d-glucamine, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4), rapidly inducing intracellular acidification (5Roos A. Boron W.F. Intracellular pH.Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2288) Google Scholar). Membrane depolarization was achieved by loading high K+ solution (145 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5). Intracellular pH-changed acid-loaded cells were detected by fluorescent probe BCECF at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength range of 500–540 nm under membrane depolarizing conditions using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5, Germany). Intracellular pH was measured in the monolayers using the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe BCECF-AM. Cells were incubated with 3.0 μm of BCECF-AM (Molecular Probe) in bicarbonate-free RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C for 30 min. After loading, the cells were washed three times with HEPES buffer to remove the extracellular dye and made to remain in the identical buffer. The HEPES buffer contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The fluorescence at excitation wavelengths of 488 and 458 nm was recorded at an emission wavelength range of 500–540 nm using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5, Germany). Calibration of fluorescence versus pH was performed by equilibration of external and internal pH with nigericin (10 μm) in a high K+ buffer with a range of pH from 6.0 to 7.6. The high K+ buffer contained 145 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES (or MES). The relative fluorescence ratio values were plotted against corresponding pHi values, which allowed determination of the unknown pHi. To examine the role of Hv1 in intracellular proton extrusion, the pH values of the extracellular milieu of the high metastatic (MDA-MB-231) and poor metastatic (MCF-7) cells were measured. All cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium in the presence of 10% FBS at confluence and then changed into unbuffered DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Invitrogen) (without sodium bicarbonate, initial pH 7.2) for 24 h at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere devoid of CO2. The medium pH values were measured using pH meter (METTLER TOLEDO). Each experiment was conducted three times. The mRNA expression levels of Hv1 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were evaluated by quantitative real time PCR using ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Total RNAs were extracted using RNAiso reagent (Takara) and reverse-transcribed by Moloney murine leukemia virus super transcriptase. Real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed with SYBR PrimeScriptTM RT-PCR kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers were as follows: Hv1, 5′-CAGGTCATCATCATCTGCTTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGTTCTGAACGTGTCTTAAC-3′ (reverse); GAPDH, 5′-CCAAGGTCATCCATGACAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGAGGCAGGGATGATGTTCT-3′ (reverse). PCR thermal condition used was s follows: 94 °C for 30 s; annealing, 52 °C for 30 s; extension, 72 °C for 30 s. Relative mRNA expression levels of proteins were calculated according to the following equation: 2−ΔΔCT, in which ΔΔCT = (CTHv1 − CTGAPDH) − (CTHv1 − CTGAPDH)MDA-MB-231. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Cells were suspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Each mouse (4–6 weeks of age, female, BALB/c nu+/nu+, from Academy of Military Science, Beijing, China) was s.c. injected into the left upper flank region on day 0. The shortest and longest diameters of the tumor were measured with calipers at 2-day intervals, and the volume of each tumor (mm3) was calculated according to length × width2/2. When the tumor volume reached ∼500 mm3, mice were sacrificed at day 30. Isolated tumors were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Five-micrometer sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin and analyzed for Ki-67 and Hv1 expression. These studies were approved by the Animal Use Committee of Institute of Hematology (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin), which approved all protocols for treating animals. All statistics were performed using SPSS16.0 software. Measurement data were represented as mean ± S.D. Comparison of the mean between groups was performed by t test. p values <0.05 were considered significant. Survival analysis was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival rate was compared by log-rank test. Hv1 in immune cells is proposed to be responsible for the proton-transporting pathway, which regulates intracellular pH during oxygen consumption associated with phagocytosis, called respiratory burst (12Decoursey T.E. Voltage-gated proton channels and other proton transfer pathways.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 475-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 13Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T.

J. 1987; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), but its function in tumorigenesis has not been identified. To investigate Hv1 for use as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for breast cancer, Hv1 expression levels in breast cancer and normal tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2, Hv1 staining was mainly moderate or strongly positive in invasive ductal carcinoma tissues but not in normal breast tissues. Hv1 was expressed in both the nucleus and the plasma membrane of tumor cells (Fig. 1). In hyperplasia of breast and ductal carcinoma in situ, the staining was negative or weakly positive (Fig. 1, B and C, and Table 2). Hv1 in invasive ductal carcinoma tissues was significantly expressed compared with that in normal breast, hyperplasia of breast, and ductal carcinoma in situ tissues (Fig. 1 and Table 2), suggesting that Hv1 may be involved in breast tumorigenesis. Overall, 61 of the 105 cases (58.1%) showed high expression Hv1 in the tumor tissues (IRS over 4), whereas 44 (41.9%) of the cases showed low expression (IRS 0–3). Generally, Hv1 staining density was significantly higher in invasive ductal carcinoma tissues than in ductal carcinoma in situ tissues (6.2 ± 3.7 versus 3.4 ± 1.6, p < 0.001) (Table 2).TABLE 2Average density of immunohistochemistry stainingType of tissuesStaining densitypMeanStandard deviationScore rangePT00.00<0.001HB0.40.50–1<0.001*DCIS3.41.61–8<0.001**IDC6.23.71–12<0.001*** Open table in a new tab The correlations between Hv1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics are summarized in Table 3.

The firing rate of some neurons is greatly modulated by attention while others are hardly affected. The reason for this variability across neurons is unknown. We found that the variability in attention modulation across neurons in area MT of macaques can be well explained by variability in the strength of tuned normalization across neurons. The presence of tuned normalization also explains a striking asymmetry in attention effects within neurons: when two stimuli are in a neuron's receptive field, directing attention to the preferred stimulus modulates firing rates more than directing attention to the nonpreferred stimulus. These findings show that much of the neuron-to-neuron variability in modulation of responses by attention depends on variability in the way the neurons process multiple stimuli, rather than differences in the influence of top-down signals related to attention.

It has long been recognized that the amount that attention modulates neuronal responses tends to be greater in later stages of cortical processing (see Maunsell and Cook, 2002Maunsell J.H.R. Cook E.P. The role of attention in visual processing.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Even within a single cortical area there is considerable variability in modulation by attention across neurons (Moran and Desimone, 1985Moran J. Desimone R.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5115-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This variance is seen even when neurons are recorded simultaneously (Cohen and Maunsell, 2010Cohen M.R. Maunsell J.H.R. A neuronal population measure of attention predicts behavioral performance on individual trials.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 15241-15253Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), indicating that it does not arise from varying levels of behavioral effort. The source of this variability in modulation by attention is unknown. Recent models of electrophysiological and fMRI data have suggested that modulation by attention depends on normalization (Boynton, 2009Boynton G.M.

Normalization is a form of gain control that limits the dynamic range of the responses of a neuron, particularly when more than one stimulus is present in the receptive field (Barlow, 1953Barlow H.B.

An influential divisive normalization model hypothesizes that the response of a neuron is reduced in proportion to the pooled activity of other neurons in the neighborhood (Heeger, 1992Heeger D.J.

This model explains a broad range of response properties, in particular why the response of a neuron to an optimal stimulus is suppressed by the addition of a nonoptimal, yet excitatory, stimulus in the receptive field (Morrone et al., 1982Morrone M.C.

Models of attention that incorporate divisive normalization explain the effects of attention across a broad range of behavioral and stimulus conditions (Boynton, 2009Boynton G.M. A framework for describing the effects of attention on visual responses.Vision Res. 2009; 49: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, Lee and Maunsell, 2009Lee J. Maunsell J.H.R.

Attentional modulation of MT neurons with single or multiple stimuli in their receptive fields.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3058-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A relationship between normalization and modulation by attention suggests an explanation for the variability in modulation by attention across neurons. Lee and Maunsell, 2009Lee J. Maunsell J.H.R. A normalization model of attentional modulation of single unit responses.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar reported that the strength of the normalization mechanism can vary between neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of macaque monkeys and that this variance is associated with differences in attention modulation: the more potent the normalization mechanism, the greater the attention modulation. They showed that this correlation could be explained by a normalization model in which attention modulates the contrast at which neuronal responses saturate. Neurons with the most saturated responses were the least affected by normalization and attention. However, in the current study we extended the range of conditions tested and obtained new electrophysiological data that could not be accounted for using the prior model. Instead, we show that the covariance between the strength of normalization and modulation by attention across all conditions is well explained by variance in the amount of tuned normalization. Tuned normalization (Rust et al., 2006Rust N.C. Mante V. Simoncelli E.P. Movshon J.A. How MT cells analyze the motion of visual patterns.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, Carandini et al., 1997Carandini M. Heeger D.J. Movshon J.A. Linearity and normalization in simple cells of the macaque primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8621-8644PubMed Google Scholar) is a variant of divisive normalization that does not weight all stimuli equally. Instead, nonpreferred stimuli are given less weight in normalization. Prior studies describing normalization have not addressed how tuned normalization affects modulation by attention (Boynton, 2009Boynton G.M. A framework for describing the effects of attention on visual responses.Vision Res. 2009; 49: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, Lee and Maunsell, 2009Lee J. Maunsell J.H.R. A normalization model of attentional modulation of single unit responses.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, Reynolds and Heeger, 2009Reynolds J.H. Heeger D.J. The normalization model of attention.Neuron. 2009; 61: 168-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). We found that the strength of tuned normalization varies considerably across MT neurons and that modulation by attention depends greatly on the extent to which the normalization of a neuron is tuned. Tuned normalization also explains a pronounced asymmetry in attention modulation that occurs when attention is directed to a preferred versus a nonpreferred stimulus in the receptive field. These results suggest that much of the variance in attention modulation between neurons may arise from differences in the amount of tuned normalization they express, rather than differences in the strength of the top-down attention signals that they receive. We studied whether tuned divisive normalization can explain variation in attention modulation across neurons by recording the activity of isolated neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of two rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We measured separately the strength of modulation by attention and the strength of normalization for 117 isolated neurons (68 from monkey 1; 49 from monkey 2). We trained each monkey to do a direction change-detection task (Figure 1). The animal fixated a spot at the center of a video monitor and then was cued by an annulus to attend to one of three locations on the monitor. Two locations were within the receptive field of the neuron being recorded. The third location was on the opposite side of the fixation point. All three stimulus locations were equidistant from the fixation point. Following the extinction of the cue, a series of drifting Gabors was presented at each of the three locations simultaneously. Each set of Gabors (one drifting Gabor per location) was presented for 200 ms with successive sets simultaneously separated by interstimulus periods that varied randomly between 158–293 ms (Figure 1C). The Gabors presented at the two locations within the receptive field drifted in either the preferred or null (180° from preferred) direction of the neuron, and the Gabors presented at the location outside of the receptive field drifted in the intermediate direction. The monkey was rewarded for detecting when a Gabor appeared at the cued location with a drift direction that was slightly off the preferred-null axis. Slight changes in the direction of motion occurred at all three locations, but the trial ended without reward if the animal responded to a change at an uncued location. To measure the effect of normalization for each neuron (Figure 1A), we collected data while the animal was cued to attend to the location outside of the receptive field, so that spatial attention did not modulate the neuron's rate of firing. To prevent feature attention from modulating the response, the Gabors presented at the cued location always drifted in the same direction, which was intermediate between the preferred and null directions of the neuron. While attention was directed outside the receptive field, series of Gabors were presented at the two locations within the receptive field. Whenever a pair of Gabors appeared in the receptive field, one drifted in the preferred direction of the neuron and the other drifted in the null direction, but the locations of the preferred and null stimuli were pseudorandomly selected on each presentation. Additionally, each receptive field stimulus had a pseudorandomly selected contrast of 0%, 50%, or 100%. Using 0% contrast meant that stimuli sometimes briefly appeared alone in the receptive field. The stimulus presentations were short (200 ms; Figure 1C) so that the animal did not have time to adjust its attention based on the contrast or number of Gabors that appeared (Williford and Maunsell, 2006Williford T. Maunsell J.H.R. Effects of spatial attention on contrast response functions in macaque area V4.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 40-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, Lee and Maunsell, 2009Lee J. Maunsell J.H.R. A normalization model of attentional modulation of single unit responses.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, Lee and Maunsell, 2010Lee J. Maunsell J.H.R. Attentional modulation of MT neurons with single or multiple stimuli in their receptive fields.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3058-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To measure the effect of spatial attention for each neuron (Figure 1B), the animal's attention was directed to one of the two locations within the receptive field. The drifting Gabors within the receptive field were independently and pseudorandomly set to a contrast of 0% or 100% on each presentation. One Gabor within the receptive field drifted in the preferred direction and the other drifted in the null direction. For most neurons (72 of 117) drift direction was pseudorandomly assigned to the receptive field locations for each short stimulus presentation. If the animal responded to a direction change from preferred to null or vice versa (i.e., 180° direction change) the trial was terminated without reward. For the remaining neurons (45/117) the locations of the preferred and null directions were fixed, but results from those neurons were not significantly different. By presenting the Gabors at 0% or 100% contrast, we could measure attention with one or two stimuli in the receptive field. Different MT neurons showed different degrees of normalization. Figure 2A shows responses from a neuron with pronounced normalization. The average response to a preferred direction alone (in either receptive field location; thick black line) was substantially reduced when a null stimulus was added to the other receptive field location (dashed line). The response to preferred and null stimuli together was approximately the average of the responses to the preferred stimulus alone (thick black line) and the null stimulus alone (gray line). An intermediate response of this sort is expected from normalization and can be described by this equation (modified from Carandini et al., 1997Carandini M. Heeger D.J. Movshon J.A. Linearity and normalization in simple cells of the macaque primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8621-8644PubMed Google Scholar):RP,N=cPLP+cNLNcP+cN+σ,(1) where cP and cN are the contrasts of the two Gabors, LP and LN are the responses of the linear receptive field to the individual Gabors at unit contrast, and σ is a positive term that represents the semisaturation constant for the contrast response function of the neuron. The divisive normalization of the neuron's firing rate is mediated by the denominator, with cP and cN representing the normalization activity associated with the preferred and the null stimuli. In this equation, the neuron's preference for one direction of motion over the other is captured by LP and LN in the numerator, but the stimulus-related terms in the denominator depend only on the contrasts of the stimuli, irrespective of the direction of motion, and are therefore “untuned” in terms of the direction of stimulus motion. This equation does an excellent job of capturing the reduction in the firing rate due to the null stimulus for neurons such as the one shown in Figure 2A, which effectively averages the responses to preferred alone and null alone when they appear together. Other MT neurons were less affected by the addition of a null stimulus to a preferred stimulus. For another neuron (Figure 2B), the average response to the preferred stimulus alone (thick black line) was only slightly reduced when a null stimulus was added to the receptive field (dashed line), although the neuron responded hardly at all to the null stimulus alone (gray line). For this neuron, the response to preferred and null together was much closer to the response to the preferred stimulus alone than it was to the average of the responses to preferred alone and null alone. The response of this neuron was therefore more like a “winner-take-all” response, with the stronger individual response determining the response to the pair. For most MT neurons, the effect of adding a null stimulus to a preferred stimulus fell between “averaging” (neuron 1, Figure 2A) and “winner-take-all” (neuron 2, Figure 2B). To quantify the strength of normalization for each neuron, we calculated a modulation index based on responses to different stimuli, [(Preferred – Null) – (Both – Null)] / [(Preferred – Null) + (Both – Null)]. When stimuli have contrasts that are well into the upper saturation of the contrast response function (cP = cN >> σ), as is generally the case for contrasts of 50% and 100% in MT (Sclar et al., 1990Sclar G. Maunsell J.H.R. Lennie P. Coding of image contrast in central visual pathways of the macaque monkey.Vision Res. 1990; 30: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), this index is 0.33 for averaging neurons that respond to preferred and null together with a response that is the average of the responses to preferred and null presented individually, and 0 for winner-take-all neurons that give the same response to the preferred and null together as they do to the preferred alone. Correspondingly, the normalization modulation indices for the neurons in Figures 2A and 2B were 0.32 and 0.06. The histogram in Figure 2C plots the distribution of normalization modulation indices for all 117 MT neurons and shows that MT neurons spanned the full range of normalization, from averaging to winner-take-all, and some distance on either side. This range of behaviors from MT neurons cannot be explained by differences in selectivity for preferred over null stimuli. Neurons with winner-take-all behavior are usually highly direction selective (e.g., Figure 2B, see below), as are most MT neurons. We found no correlation between normalization modulation index and direction selectivity modulation index [(Preferred – Null) / (Preferred + Null)] across the population of MT neurons (R = 0.11, p = 0.25). Equation 1 dictates that adding a null stimulus at 100% contrast (cN = 1 >> σ) to a receptive field containing a preferred stimulus also at 100% contrast (cP = 1 >> σ) should always produce a response to the two stimuli together that is approximately the average of the responses to the two stimuli separately (i.e., normalization modulation index of 0.33). Consequently, Equation 1 cannot account for the range of normalization modulation indices seen among MT neurons (Figure 2C). The differences between MT neurons can be readily explained by tuned normalization, in which different stimuli contribute differentially to normalization. Tuned normalization has been described for MT before (Rust et al., 2006Rust N.C. Mante V. Simoncelli E.P. Movshon J.A. How MT cells analyze the motion of visual patterns.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and can be captured by adding a term that adjusts the contributions of different stimuli to normalization (modified from “anisotropic normalization” of Carandini et al., 1997Carandini M. Heeger D.J. Movshon J.A. Linearity and normalization in simple cells of the macaque primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8621-8644PubMed Google Scholar):RP,N=cPLP+cNLNcP+αcN+σ(2) Here α scales how much the null stimulus contributes to normalization relative to the preferred stimulus. When α is 1 an average response results, and when α is 0 the response is winner-take-all. We will take this approach to explain the variability in the normalization of MT neurons and show that this variability in tuned normalization accounts for much of the variability in the attention modulation of MT neurons. Differences in normalization between neurons were correlated with differences in the strength of modulation by attention. Figures 2D and 2E plot the effects of spatial attention on the responses of neurons 1 and 2 (Figures 2A and 2B). These neurons differed greatly in the extent to which they were modulated by attention. When both the preferred and the null stimuli were presented in the receptive field of neuron 1 (Figure 2D), responses were much stronger when attention was directed to the location containing the preferred stimulus (red) than when attention was directed to the location containing the null stimulus (green). Strong modulation from shifting spatial attention between preferred and null stimuli in the receptive field has been described many times in a variety of cortical areas (Moran and Desimone, 1985Moran J.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5115-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, Figure 2E shows that attention had much less effect on the responses of neuron 2 (Figure 2B). For each neuron, we calculated an attention index: (Attend Preferred – Attend Null) / (Attend Preferred + Attend Null). The attention indices for the neurons in Figures 2D and 2E were 0.27 and 0.07. As shown in Figure 2F, the responses of some MT neurons were virtually unmodulated by attention (0) while the responses of others were modulated by a factor of three (0.5) or more. Modeling studies have suggested that modulation by attention may depend on normalization mechanisms (Boynton, 2009Boynton G.M. A framework for describing the effects of attention on visual responses.Vision Res. 2009; 49: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, Lee and Maunsell, 2009Lee J. Maunsell J.H.R.

The normalization model of attention.Neuron. 2009; 61: 168-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) and one neurophysiological study showed that there is a neuron-to-neuron correlation between the strength of normalization of MT neurons and the strength of their modulation by spatial attention (Lee and Maunsell, 2009Lee J. Maunsell J.H.R. A normalization model of attentional modulation of single unit responses.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The current data confirm that neurons with pronounced normalization modulation also show pronounced modulation by attention. Figure 3 shows the relationship between normalization and attention modulations across neurons in our sample (R = 0.53, p < 10−8). As normalization approaches zero, modulation by attention approaches zero. It is important to recognize that a correlation between modulation by normalization and modulation by attention could depend in part on differences in direction selectivity: a ne"

Using a spike-field approach, we identify a population of parietal area LIP neurons that fire spikes coherently with 15 Hz beta-frequency LFP activity. The firing rate of coherently active neurons predicts the reaction times (RTs) of coordinated reach-saccade movements but not of saccades when made alone. Area LIP neurons that do not fire coherently do not predict RT of either movement type. Similar beta-band LFP activity is present in the parietal reach region but not nearby visual area V3d. This suggests that coherent spiking activity in PPC can control reaches and saccades together.

The tight link between vision and reaching means that arm movements are coordinated with eye movements (Song and McPeek, 2009Song J.-H. McPeek R.M.

Medendorp W.P. Marotta J.J. Spatial transformations for eye-hand coordination.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Coordinated reach and saccade movements are a central aspect of our natural behavior and lead to faster and more accurate movements (Neggers and Bekkering, 2002Neggers S.F.W. Bekkering H. Coordinated control of eye and hand movements in dynamic reaching.Hum. Mov. Sci. 2002; 21: 349-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An intriguing feature of coordinated reach and saccade movements is that the reaction time (RT) of the reach is correlated with the RT of the saccade (Lünenburger et al., 2000Lünenburger L. Kutz D.F.

Although RTs are influenced by nonspecific factors like motivation and arousal (Broadbent, 1971Broadbent D. Decision and Stress. Academic Press, London1971Google Scholar, Barry et al., 2005Barry R.J.

Movement coordination depends on the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which constructs representations of space for different movements (Andersen and Buneo, 2002Andersen R.A. Buneo C.A. Intentional maps in posterior parietal cortex.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 189-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, Bisley and Goldberg, 2010Bisley J.W. Goldberg M.E. Attention, intention, and priority in the parietal lobe.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 33: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Damage to the PPC gives rise to a range of deficits of visual-motor coordination, suggesting that the ability to coordinate gaze with arm and hand movements fundamentally depends on parietal mechanisms (Gaveau et al., 2008Gaveau V. Pélisson D. Blangero A. Urquizar C. Prablanc C. Vighetto A. Pisella L. Saccade control and eye-hand coordination in optic ataxia.Neuropsychologia. 2008; 46: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Neural firing within the lateral intraparietal area (area LIP) and the parietal reach region (PRR), two subdivisions of the PPC, encodes spatial representations that guide saccadic eye movements and arm movements, respectively (Snyder et al., 1997Snyder L.H. Batista A.P. Andersen R.A. Coding of intention in the posterior parietal cortex.Nature. 1997; 386: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Coordinated saccade and reach movements may result from spatial representations in posterior parietal circuits that are shared between effectors. Local field potentials (LFPs) in area LIP and PRR also encode spatial representations for saccades and reaches (Pesaran et al., 2002Pesaran B. Pezaris J.S. Sahani M. Mitra P.P. Andersen R.A. Temporal structure in neuronal activity during working memory in macaque parietal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, Scherberger et al., 2005Scherberger H. Jarvis M.R. Andersen R.A. Cortical local field potential encodes movement intentions in the posterior parietal cortex.Neuron. 2005; 46: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). LFP activity is generated by temporally coherent patterns of activity in neural circuits (Mitzdorf, 1985Mitzdorf U. Current source-density method and application in cat cerebral cortex: investigation of evoked potentials and EEG phenomena.Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 37-100PubMed Google Scholar, Pesaran, 2009Pesaran B. Uncovering the mysterious origins of local field potentials.Neuron. 2009; 61: 1-2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since spatial representations are observed in posterior parietal LFP activity, coherent patterns of neural activity in posterior parietal circuits may coordinate movements through the formation of shared movement representations. To identify shared representations supporting coordinated movement, we recorded spiking and LFP activity in area LIP of two monkeys making either coordinated reach and saccade movements or isolated saccades after a short (1–1.5 s) memory delay. For comparison, we also made recordings in PRR and the dorsal part of visual area 3 (V3d). By taking a spike-field approach (Pesaran et al., 2008Pesaran B. Nelson M.J. Andersen R.A. Free choice activates a decision circuit between frontal and parietal cortex.Nature. 2008; 453: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, Pesaran, 2010Pesaran B. Neural correlations, decisions, and actions.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2010; 20: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we found that RT was predicted by the activity of area LIP neurons that fired coherently in a 15 Hz beta-frequency band. Area LIP neurons that did not participate in the coherent activity did not predict RT. Area LIP activity only predicted RT before coordinated movements and not when saccades were made alone. The same pattern of results was present in beta-band LFP power in area LIP. Beta-band LFP power also predicted RT in PRR but not in V3d. We propose that coherent beta-band activity in area LIP and PRR coordinates the timing of eye and arm movements through a shared representation that can be used to slow or speed both movements together. Figure 1 presents two potential mechanisms for how neural activity could control reaches and saccades. Reach and saccade movements could rely on separate representations for each movement (Figure 1A , left): a saccade representation that guides eye movements and a reach representation that guides arm movements. If so, increases in saccade preparation will shorten saccade RTs without affecting reach RTs (Figure 1A, upper right), and increases in reach preparation will shorten reach RTs without affecting saccade RTs (Figure 1A, lower right). As a result, effector-specific representations cannot coordinate movements because they do not give rise to correlated RTs without other influences. A neural mechanism of coordinated reach and saccade movements could, instead, depend on a shared representation that controls both movements so that they are made together (Figure 1B, left). If there is a shared representation, increases in coordinated movement preparation will shorten both saccade and reach RTs (Figure 1B, right), and neural activity related to coordination will predict both saccade and reach RTs. Covariations in coordinated preparation in this model could give rise to saccade and reach RT correlations. Analyzing the link between RT and neural activity might reveal shared representations that control both movements together. We trained two monkeys to make either coordinated reaches and saccades (Figure 2A ) or saccades alone (Figure 2B) to a visually cued target. Before coordinated movements, saccade RTs (SRTs) were correlated with reach RTs (RRTs; example in Figure 2C; R = 0.69, mean SRT = 190 ms, mean RRT = 280 ms). Across 105 experimental sessions, SRT-RRT correlations were 0.50 ± 0.24 (mean ± std). Mean SRT across the population was also significantly faster when the saccade was made with a reach (243 ± 0.6 ms, mean ± SEM) than when it was made alone (252 ± 0.6 ms; p < 0.001). These results demonstrate that correlations exist between RTs for saccades and reaches such that saccades can be initiated more quickly when made with a reach. We recorded spiking and LFP activity from 105 sites in area LIP (74 in Monkey H; 31 in Monkey J), 135 sites in PRR (53 in Monkey H; 82 in Monkey J) and 36 visually responsive sites in V3d (36 in Monkey J; Figures 3A and S1). We first present example activity from a single session recorded in area LIP during the reach and saccade task. Spiking and LFP activity in area LIP showed robust selectivity for the preferred (Figure 3Bi) compared with the null (Figure 3Ci) direction. Spatial tuning was present in LFP activity with different dynamics at different frequencies. One pattern of power changes was present before movements to the preferred direction (Figure 3Bii), and another pattern was present before movements to the null direction (Figure 3Cii). LFP power was generally greatest around 15–17 Hz in the beta-frequency band and decreased relative to baseline for preferred direction trials (Figure 3D). In contrast, LFP power increased at frequencies above ∼30 Hz in the gamma-frequency band, and the opposite pattern was present for trials in the null direction (Figure 3E). Thus, reach and saccade movements influence the rate of spiking as well as LFP power in both gamma- and beta-frequency bands. To build a link between neural activity and coordination, we then related LFP power and spike firing rate to saccade and reach RTs. We started by considering LFP power. We examined whether LFP activity predicts movement RTs by grouping LFP power during trials with the slowest or fastest RTs. We selected LFP activity from 72 sites in area LIP with at least 60 trials in each direction and for each task (Monkey H: 57 sites; Monkey J: 15 sites). Before reach and saccade movements in the preferred direction, beta-band LFP power (15 Hz) was significantly greater during the 33% of trials with the slowest SRTs than for the 33% of trials with the fastest SRTs (Figure 4A ; p < 0.05, rank-sum test). The effect was even stronger when the data was grouped according to RRTs (Figure 4B; p < 0.001, rank-sum test). In the following, we will present gamma-band activity by analyzing signals at 45 Hz because this activity displayed the strongest spatially selective persistent memory activity across the population of recordings (see below). At 45 Hz, we found that LFP power was not significantly selective for either RT (SRT: p = 0.32, RRT: p = 0.67, rank-sum test). We obtained similar results at other frequencies above 30 Hz (For example, at 65 Hz, SRT: p = 0.11, RRT: p = 0.23, rank-sum test). Since greater beta-band LFP power is associated with slower RTs, decreasing beta-band LFP power may speed movement initiation. The RT selectivity of beta-band LFP power before a reach and saccade is spatially specific and present before movements to the preferred direction. Before movements to the null direction, the activity was not significantly greater during slow trials regardless of whether activity was sorted by saccade RT or reach RT (Figures 4C and 4D; RRT: p = 0.43. SRT: p = 0.27, rank-sum test). To further establish the specificity of beta-band activity for specific interactions between reach and saccade processes, we asked whether RT selectivity is also present when saccades are made alone. There was no significant difference between activity across the population for the fast versus slow RTs when saccades were made alone in the preferred direction (Figure 4E; at 15 Hz, p = 0.18, rank-sum test) or the null direction (Figure 4F; at 15 Hz, p = 0.63, rank-sum test). Lack of RT selectivity before saccades is also not associated with a lack of spatial selectivity. LFP activity was significantly greater for saccades in the preferred direction than in the null direction (Figures 4E and 4F; Supplemental Information). Therefore, beta-band LFP power in area LIP correlates with SRT only when a saccade is made with a coordinated reach in the preferred direction. The level of beta-band power before movements to the preferred direction, however, is greater before saccades made alone than before coordinated movements. Since SRTs are faster before coordinated reach and saccade movements than before saccades made alone, this is consistent with increasing beta-band activity slowing down movement initiation. The overall picture is that beta-band activity exerts a braking mechanism to control the timing of saccades with reaches. Next, we determined whether beta-band selectivity for RT was also present in the spiking activity of area LIP neurons. We recorded isolated action potentials from 59 neurons that showed spatially tuned activity before a coordinated reach and saccade (p < 0.05; permutation test, 48 neurons in Monkey H; 11 neurons in Monkey J). To determine whether spiking activity that is coherent with beta-band LFP activity also predicts RT, we first divided neurons into two groups: coherent cells and not coherent cells. We defined coherent cells as those cells with activity that is significantly correlated with nearby beta-band LFP activity in area LIP. We defined not coherent cells as those cells whose activity is not significantly correlated with nearby beta-band LFP activity. Thirty-four cells (34/59, 58%) were significantly correlated with LFP at 15 Hz in the late-delay epoch, 500–1,000 ms after target onset (coherent cells; p < 0.05). The remaining 25 cells (25/59, 42%) were not significantly correlated with LFP activity (not coherent cells; p > 0.05). The firing rate of coherent cells showed stronger spatially tuning than the activity of not coherent cells (Figure 5). The difference in firing rate before movements in the preferred and null directions was greater for coherent cells than not coherent cells for both tasks (Figures 5A and 5B; coherent cell average firing rate = 14.9 sp/s; not coherent cell average firing rate = 7.3 sp/s). In general, firing rate was higher for coherent versus not coherent cells throughout the trial, including during the baseline epoch. Note that although firing rate is elevated during the delay as opposed to the baseline epoch, LFP directional selectivity and power (see Figure 3Bii) drop off at frequencies > 60 Hz during the delay. This suggests that the band-limited effects that we see at frequencies < 60 Hz are not due to increased spiking activity associated with upcoming movements in the preferred direction. To determine whether the definition of a cell as coherent or not coherent was consistent across the trial, we also analyzed spike-field coherence during the target epoch, 0–500 ms after target onset, and during the baseline epoch, 500 ms immediately before target onset. Almost the same proportion of cells was defined as coherent during the target epoch (coherent: 35/59, 59%; not coherent: 24/59, 41%) as during the late-delay epoch. The definition of a cell as coherent was consistent between target and late- delay epochs for 44 out of 59 cells (44/59, 75%). We observed consistent results based on the baseline epoch. A similar proportion of cells was defined as coherent during the baseline epoch (coherent: 31/59, 53%; not coherent: 28/59, 47%). The definition of a cell as coherent was again consistent between baseline and late-delay epochs, with 42 cells (42/59, 71%) having the same definition for both epochs. Therefore, the definition of a cell as coherent or not coherent did not vary substantially across the trial. Because we observed beta-band selectivity for RT in the LFP during the delay, we chose to focus our analysis of spiking using the definition of coherence during the delay. The difference in spike-field coherence was not simply due to an increase in firing rate. First, coherence is normalized by the firing rate. Second, if coherence were an artifact of higher firing rates, we would expect that the largest differences in firing rate between coherent and not coherent cells would be present during the late-delay epoch, when coherence was estimated. However, the largest differences in firing rate were not present during the late-delay epoch. The largest differences in firing rate were present immediately following the target onset. Third, the same proportions of neurons were coherently active immediately following target onset and during the late-delay epoch despite the difference in firing rates between these epochs. Fourth, although coherent activity can be detected more easily when the firing rate is higher (Zeitler et al., 2006Zeitler M. Fries P. Gielen S. Assessing neuronal coherence with single-unit, multi-unit, and local field potentials.Neural Comput. 2006; 18: 2256-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the number of false positives resulting from the statistical testing procedure we use does not vary with firing rate in the absence of coherent activity (see Supplemental Information; see also [Maris et al., 2007Maris E. Schoffelen J.M. Fries P. Nonparametric statistical testing of coherence differences.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2007; 163: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar]). Finally, we recalculated SFC after decimating the firing rate of the significantly coherent units by 50% to match the firing rate of those units not coherent with the local fields. We found that, after decimation, 29/34 (85%) remained significantly coherent with LFP. Consequently, although there was a difference between the firing rate of coherent and not coherent cells, the difference in firing rate we report here was not due to a confounding influence of firing rate on coherence. To determine whether coherent and not coherent spiking predicted RT, we performed an ANOVA to determine whether individual neurons showed significant differences in firing rate between the fast and slow RT trials. We found that before a reach and saccade, 21% of coherent cells have significant (p < 0.05) differences in firing rate between fast and slow RRT groups and 9% have significant differences between fast and slow SRT groups. Of these recordings, 70% showed a decrease in firing rate with faster RTs and the remaining 30% showed an increase in firing rate. We also found that only 3% of coherently active cells are significantly selective for SRT during the saccade alone task, which is within the expected proportion of false positives (5%). Finally, and most importantly, when cells are not coherently active, fewer than 5% of cells show significantly selective differences in firing rate for the fast and slow reaction times for all combinations of task and RT type (reach and saccade, RRT: 4%; reach and saccade, SRT 0%; saccade alone, SRT 4%). To quantify the extent to which populations of cells with coherent and not coherent spiking predicted RT, we used a decoding algorithm to predict the RT from each cell population (Figure 5C; see Experimental Procedures). Unlike the LFP analysis, which was done using fixed proportions of fast and slow trials, the population decoding algorithm required that we use a fixed number of trials in each group. We analyzed the fastest or slowest 25 trials (SRT or RRT) in the preferred direction. Ideally, more trials would be available to perform a multiple neuron decoding analysis but this was the largest number of trials available in the database of neuronal recordings for which there was no overlap between the RTs for the fast and slow groups. Quantifying the extent to which RT could be decoded from neural populations allowed us to summarize and compare the strength of the results across tasks and movements. We computed the probability of correct classification of trials in the preferred direction as fast or slow RT trials, based on firing rate in the eight cells with significant RT selectivity based on an ANOVA. Before coordinated movements to the preferred direction, coherent cells significantly predicted whether a trial had a fast or slow RRT (decode probability correct: 0.86; p < 0.001 binomial test) and a fast or slow SRT (decode probability correct: 0.72; p < 0.001). In contrast, not coherent cells did not significantly predict RRT (decode probability correct: 0.58, p = 0.16) or SRT (decode probability correct: 0.48; p = 0.56). Coherently active cells predicted RRT significantly better than cells that were not coherently active (p < 0.005, two-sample binomial test). Coherently active cells also predicted SRT significantly better than not coherent cells (p < 0.05). Importantly, coherent cells encoded the speed of RTs only when movements were coordinated. When saccades were made alone, despite the fact that mean firing rate did not differ for reach and saccade versus saccade alone trials (Figures 5A and 5B), the decoder performed at chance (decode probability correct: 0.56, p = 0.16). The not coherent cells also did not predict SRT (decode probability correct: 0.48, p = 0.56). The performance advantage of the coherent cell population in decoding RT was not due to the fact that there were more cells in the coherent population than the not coherent population. We repeated the analysis for increasing sizes of coherent and not coherent populations up to the number of available cells. The coherent population outperformed the not coherent population for all cell subsets greater than two (Figure S2). Although we report here the results for eight cells, note that, for all numbers of coherent cells greater than three, the decoder performs best and above chance for RRT during coordinated movements. The decoder also performs well and usually above chance for SRT during coordinated movements at all numbers of cells but not for SRT during saccades made alone or for not coherent cells. We also examined whether the better decoding performance of the coherent cells could be due to their higher overall firing rate. When we subtracted the mean firing rate from each cell before decoding the firing rate, we found that the results maintained the same pattern of significance. Coherently active cells predicted coordinated movement RT significantly better than cells that were not coherently active (RRT: p < 0.05. SRT: p < 0.01). Neither group of cells predicted SRT before saccades made alone (Coherent decode probability correct = 0.48. Not coherent decode probability correct = 0.46). Additionally, we decimated the firing rate of the significantly coherent units by 50% to match the firing rate of the not coherent units (see Experimental Procedures). When we performed the RT decoding analysis on the coherent units after decimating the firing rates, we found no significant change in performance when decoding RRT (decode probability correct = 0.70, p < 0.05) or SRT (decode probability correct = 0.62, p < 0.05) before a coordinated movement. Therefore, beta-band LFP activity reflects a population of neurons whose firing rate reliably predicts the RT of coordinated eye-hand movements but not saccades made alone. Neurons which do not participate in the coherent beta-band LFP activity do not predict RT of either movement type. Beta-band activity may reflect the coordinated control of reach and saccade RTs together. We have shown that beta-band spiking and LFP activity varies with both SRT and RRT across a population of sites, but this is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that the control of saccade and reach RTs occurs together. Activity at some sites may be involved in controlling one effector, while activity at different sites may control the other effector. To link beta-band activity to the coordinated control of movement timing, we examined whether selectivity for both saccade and reach RTs is present in activity at the same sites. We determined RT selectivity by grouping LFP power during trials with the slowest 33% of RTs and LFP power during trials with the fastest 33% of SRTs and computing a z-score using random permutations (see Experimental Procedures) and found that RT selectivity does exist for both movements at the same sites (Figure 6A ). At 15 Hz, LFP activity was significantly selective for both SRT and RRT at 10/72 sites (14%; p < 0.01, Binomial test). In comparison, LFP activity at 45 Hz was selective for both RTs at only 2/72 sites (3%; p = 0.88. Binomial test. Figure 6B). The strength of the effect at single sites is limited by the number of trials available for analysis. When we restrict our analysis to recording sites with at least 135 trials per direction and task, 30% of recording sites were significantly selective for both SRT and RRT in the beta-band. We found a high degree of correlation between SRT selectivity and RRT selectivity in both the beta-band (R = 0.65 at 15 Hz) and the gamma-band (R = 0.41 at 45 Hz). Thus, LFP activity at each recording site predicts the RT of both the saccade and the reach in a similar manner, with the strongest effects present in the beta band. These data suggest that if changes in beta-band power change the RT for both movements, beta-band activity could coordinate movement timing. If beta-band power reflects the joint control of movement RTs, variations in the level of beta-band power could give rise to correlations in the behavioral RTs, and lack of power variation could lead to a reduction or even elimination in the RT correlations. To test this prediction, we calculated the relationship between saccade and reach RTs across groups of trials when beta-band power is relatively constant (see Experimental Procedures). This approach is similar to a partial correlation analysis, which is defined by the relationship between two variables while controlling for a third variable, but it does not require us to correlate LFP power and RT trial-by-trial. We found that average RT correlations calculated during groups of trials when beta-band power was relatively constant (R = 0.32) were significantly lower than correlations calculated in the same way when beta-band power varied (R = 0.37). The difference in RT correlation was significant (p < 0.05, rank-sum test). An average of 18% of the correlation between saccade and reach RTs could be explained by variations in beta-band power in area LIP. At some sites, beta-band power could explain over 60% of the RT correlations. Since SRT and RRT are less correlated when beta-band power does not vary, variation in the level of beta-band activity can contribute to RT correlations. Beta-band power is selective for RT in other areas of posterior parietal cortex and is not selective for RT in nearby occipital cortex. We analyzed a complementary data set of 122 LFP recordings in PRR and 36 visually responsive recordings in V3d, located along the lunate sulcus, with at least 60 trials in each condition, and we plotted RT selectivity from all three areas as the trial progressed (Figure 7). Beta-band LFP activity in area LIP was increasingly selective for RT as the memory period progressed (Figures 7A and 7B). The RT effect was also robust in PRR where 28/122 sessions (23%) were significantly selective when trials were sorted by RRT, and 18/122 sessions (15%) were significantly selective when trials were sorted as a function of SRT (Figures 7C and 7D). In comparison, at 45 Hz, only 12/122 sessions (10%, data not shown) were significantly selective for RRT, and 7/122 sessions (6%, data not shown) were selective for SRT, which is not statistically significant (Binomial test). Beta-band power in the visual areas we studied, in contrast, is not selective throughout the trial (Figures 7E and 7F). PRR LFP recordings also showed RT selectivity for both movements at the same site (data not shown). As in area LIP, LFP activity at 15 Hz in PRR was significantly selective for both SRT and RRT at 22/122 sites (18%; p < 0.01), while at 45 Hz, LFP was selective for both RTs at only 4/122 sites (3%) which, as in area LIP, is not statistically signif"

To characterize the biological roles of MT6-MMP, it is critical to identify its substrates for which only seven are currently known. Here, we biochemically characterized MT6-MMP, profiled its tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase inhibitory spectrum, performed degradomics analyses, and screened 26 chemokines for cleavage using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. MT6-MMP processes seven each of the CXC and CC chemokine subfamilies. Notably, cleavage of the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL5 activates the chemokine, thereby increasing its agonist activity, indicating a feed-forward mechanism for neutrophil recruitment. Likewise, cleavage also activated CCL15 and CCL23 to increase monocyte recruitment. Utilizing the proteomics approach proteomic identification of cleavage site specificity (PICS), we identified 286 peptidic cleavage sites spanning from P6 to P6' from which an unusual glutamate preference in P1 was identified. The degradomics screen terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS), which enriches for neo-N-terminal peptides of cleaved substrates, was used to identify 58 new native substrates in fibroblast secretomes after incubation with MT6-MMP. Vimentin, cystatin C, galectin-1, IGFBP-7, and secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) were among those substrates we biochemically confirmed. An extracellular ""moonlighting"" form of vimentin is a chemoattractant for THP-1 cells, but MT6-MMP cleavage abolished monocyte recruitment. Unexpectedly, the MT6-MMP-cleaved vimentin potently stimulated phagocytosis, which was not a property of the full-length protein. Hence, MT6-MMP regulates neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis and by generating ""eat-me"" signals upon vimentin cleavage potentially increases phagocytic removal of neutrophils to resolve inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2014448626,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Ku heterodimer contributes to telomere maintenance as a component of telomeric chromatin and as an accessory subunit of telomerase. How Ku binding to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and to telomerase RNA (TLC1) promotes Ku's telomeric functions is incompletely understood. We demonstrate that deletions designed to constrict the DNA-binding ring of Ku80 disrupt nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), telomeric gene silencing, and telomere length maintenance, suggesting that these functions require Ku's DNA end-binding activity. Contrary to the current model, a mutant Ku with low affinity for dsDNA also loses affinity for TLC1 both in vitro and in vivo. Competition experiments reveal that wild-type Ku binds dsDNA and TLC1 mutually exclusively. Cells expressing the mutant Ku are deficient in nuclear accumulation of TLC1, as expected from the RNA-binding defect. These findings force reconsideration of the mechanisms by which Ku assists in recruiting telomerase to natural telomeres and broken chromosome ends. PAPERCLIP:"

Here, we use genetically encoded reporters to image synaptic transmission across a population of sensory neurons-bipolar cells in the retina of live zebrafish. We demonstrate that the luminance sensitivities of these synapses varies over 10(4) with a log-normal distribution. About half the synapses made by ON and OFF cells alter their polarity of transmission as a function of luminance to generate a triphasic tuning curve with distinct maxima and minima. These nonlinear synapses signal temporal contrast with greater sensitivity than linear ones. Triphasic tuning curves increase the dynamic range over which bipolar cells signal light and improve the efficiency with which luminance information is transmitted.

https://openalex.org/W2027532748,"Subcellular localization of mRNAs by cytoskeletal motors plays critical roles in the spatial control of protein function. However, optical limitations of studying mRNA transport in vivo mean that there is little mechanistic insight into how transcripts are packaged and linked to motors, and how the movement of mRNA-motor complexes on the cytoskeleton is orchestrated. Here, we have reconstituted transport of mRNPs containing specific RNAs in vitro. We show directly that mRNAs that are either apically localized or non-localized in Drosophila melanogaster embryos associate with the dynein motor and move bidirectionally on individual microtubules, with localizing mRNPs exhibiting a strong minus-end-directed bias. Single-molecule fluorescence measurements reveal that RNA localization signals increase the average number of dynein and dynactin components recruited to individual mRNPs. We find that, surprisingly, individual RNA molecules are present in motile mRNPs in vitro and provide evidence that this is also the case in vivo. Thus, RNA oligomerization is not obligatory for transport. Our findings lead to a model in which RNA localization signals produce highly polarized distributions of transcript populations through modest changes in motor copy number on single mRNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2074395695,"Large pleiomorphic carriers leave the Golgi complex for the plasma membrane by en bloc extrusion of specialized tubular domains, which then undergo fission. Several components of the underlying molecular machinery have been identified, including those involved in the budding/initiation of tubular carrier precursors (for example, the phosphoinositide kinase PI(4)KIIIβ, the GTPase ARF, and FAPP2), and in the fission of these precursors (for example, PKD, CtBP1-S/BARS). However, how these proteins interact to bring about carrier formation is poorly understood. Here, we describe a protein complex that mediates carrier formation and contains budding and fission molecules, as well as other molecules, such as the adaptor protein 14-3-3γ. Specifically, we show that 14-3-3γ dimers bridge CtBP1-S/BARS with PI(4)KIIIβ, and that the resulting complex is stabilized by phosphorylation by PKD and PAK. Disrupting the association of these proteins inhibits the fission of elongating carrier precursors, indicating that this complex couples the carrier budding and fission processes."
https://openalex.org/W2076511279,"The corpus callosum is the most prominent commissural connection between the cortical hemispheres, and numerous neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with callosal agenesis. By using mice either with meningeal overgrowth or selective loss of meninges, we have identified a cascade of morphogenic signals initiated by the meninges that regulates corpus callosum development. The meninges produce BMP7, an inhibitor of callosal axon outgrowth. This activity is overcome by the induction of expression of Wnt3 by the callosal pathfinding neurons, which antagonize the inhibitory effects of BMP7. Wnt3 expression in the cingulate callosal pathfinding axons is developmentally regulated by another BMP family member, GDF5, which is produced by the adjacent Cajal-Retzius neurons and turns on before outgrowth of the callosal axons.

Here, we used our calpain-1 null mouse model to evaluate the function of calpain-1 in neural degeneration following a rodent model of traumatic brain injury. In vivo, calpain-1 null mice show significantly less neural degeneration and apoptosis and a smaller contusion 3 days post-injury than wild type littermates. Protection from traumatic brain injury corroborated with the resistance of calpain-1 neurons to apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. Biochemical analysis revealed that caspase-3 activation, extracellular calcium entry, mitochondrial membrane permeability, and release of apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria are partially blocked in the calpain-1 null neurons. These findings suggest that the calpain-1 knock-out mice may serve as a useful model system for neuronal protection and apoptosis in traumatic brain injury and other neurodegenerative disorders in which oxidative stress plays a role."

Given the co-stimulatory role of natural-killer group 2, member D protein (NKG2D) on CD8(+) T cells, we investigated its ability to rescue these immunologically impotent cells. We demonstrate that augmented co-stimulation through NKG2D during priming paradoxically rescues memory, but not effector, CD8(+) T cell responses. NKG2D-mediated rescue is characterized by reversal of elevated transcription factor T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet) expression and recovery of interleukin-2 and interferon-γ production and cytolytic responses. Rescue is abrogated in CD8(+) T cells lacking NKG2D. Augmented co-stimulation through NKG2D confers a high rate of survival to mice lacking CD4(+) T cells in a CD4-dependent influenza model and rescues HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell responses from CD4-deficient HIV-positive donors. These findings demonstrate that augmented co-stimulation through NKG2D is effective in rescuing CD4-unhelped CD8(+) T cells from their pathophysiological fate and may provide therapeutic benefits."

However, the signaling cascade linking microtubule disruption to HIF-1α inactivation has not been elucidated. Here, we show that microtubule-targeting drug (MTD) treatment impaired HIF-1α protein nuclear translocation, which significantly down-regulated HIF transcriptional activity. We provide strong evidence that HIF-1α protein associates with polymerized microtubules and traffics to the nucleus, with the aid of the dynein motor protein. Together, these data suggest that microtubules are critically involved in the nuclear trafficking and transcriptional activity of HIF-1α. We also show that the connection between the microtubule cytoskeleton and HIF-1α regulation is lost in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), where HIF-1α is overexpressed because of mutations in the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein. Specifically, we show that MTD treatment of RCC cells did not impair HIF-1α nuclear accumulation or transcriptional activity, and had no effect on the polysome association profile of HIF-1α. Interestingly, we found that HIF-1α protein did not bind microtubules in RCC. Moreover, restoration of VHL function failed to restore the ability of MTDs to inhibit HIF-1α, suggesting that VHL does not contribute to this phenotype. Together, these results suggest that HIF-1α regulation is microtubule-independent, and likely contributes to the chemoresistant nature of RCCs. Further understanding of the microtubule-dependent HIF-1α regulation, and lack thereof in RCC, is essential given the importance of HIF-1α in tumor biology, and the widespread use of MTDs in clinical oncology.

https://openalex.org/W2107341911,"The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC) is a ubiquitin ligase that is required for exit from mitosis. We previously showed that tosyl arginine methyl ester (TAME) inhibits APC-dependent proteolysis by competing with the C-terminal isoleucine-arginine tail of the APC activator cell division cycle 20 (Cdc20) for APC binding. Here we show that in the absence of APC substrates, TAME ejects Cdc20 from the APC by promoting Cdc20 autoubiquitination in its N-terminal region. Cyclin B1 antagonizes TAME's effect by promoting binding of free Cdc20 to the APC and by suppressing Cdc20 autoubiquitination. Nevertheless, TAME stabilizes cyclin B1 in Xenopus extracts by two mechanisms. First, it reduces the k(cat) of the APC-Cdc20-cyclin B1 complex without affecting the K(m), slowing the initial ubiquitination of unmodified cyclin B1. Second, as cyclin B1 becomes ubiquitinated, it loses its ability to promote Cdc20 binding to the APC in the presence of TAME. As a result, cyclin B1 ubiquitination terminates before reaching the threshold necessary for proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2136968036,"Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) exerts multiple biological effects via the G-protein-coupled receptor GIPR, including glucose-stimulated insulin production and secretion, cell proliferation, and antiapoptosis in pancreatic β-cells. In an obese state, the circulating level of GIP is elevated. GIPR-knockout mice are resistant to high-fat-diet-induced obesity. The rising evidence suggests a potential role of GIP in adipocyte biology and lipid metabolism. In our study, we overexpressed GIPR in 3T3-L1 CAR adipocytes and demonstrated that GIP impaired the physiological functions of adipocytes as a consequence of increased production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and phosphorylation of IkB kinase (IKK)-β through activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway. Activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway was also observed during GIP-induced inflammatory responses in adipocytes. The inhibition of JNK blocked GIP-stimulated secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as phosphorylation of IKKβ. In addition, GIP-induced inflammatory response increased basal glucose uptake but inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Moreover, GIP-induced adipocyte inflammation impaired insulin signaling in adipocytes as demonstrated by a reduction of AKT phosphorylation. Our results suggest that GIP might be one of the stimuli attributable to obesity-induced insulin resistance via the induction of adipocyte inflammation.—Nie, Y., Ma, R. C., Chan, J.

https://openalex.org/W2021138450,"Eukaryotic vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) is regulated by a reversible dissociation mechanism that involves breaking and reforming of protein-protein interactions at the interface of the V(1)-ATPase and V(o)-proton channel domains. We found previously that the head domain of the single copy C subunit (C(head)) binds one subunit EG heterodimer with high affinity (Oot, R.A. and Wilkens, S. (2010) J. Biol. Chem. 285, 24654-24664). Here we generated a water-soluble construct of the N-terminal domain of the V(o) ""a"" subunit composed of amino acid residues 104-372 (a(NT(104-372))). Analytical gel filtration chromatography and sedimentation velocity analysis revealed that a(NT(104-372)) undergoes reversible dimerization in a concentration-dependent manner. A low-resolution molecular envelope was calculated for the a(NT(104-372)) dimer using small angle x-ray scattering data. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments revealed that a(NT(104-372)) binds the C(foot) and EG heterodimer with dissociation constants of 22 and 33 μM, respectively. We speculate that the spatial closeness of the a(NT), C(foot), and EG binding sites in the intact V-ATPase results in a high-avidity interaction that is able to resist the torque of rotational catalysis, and that reversible enzyme dissociation is initiated by breaking either the a(NT(104-372))-C(foot) or a(NT(104-372))-EG interaction by an as-yet unknown signaling mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1999284411,"We present the first structure of a glycoside hydrolase family 79 β-glucuronidase from Acidobacterium capsulatum, both as a product complex with β-D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) and as its trapped covalent 2-fluoroglucuronyl intermediate. This enzyme consists of a catalytic (β/α)(8)-barrel domain and a β-domain with irregular Greek key motifs that is of unknown function. The enzyme showed β-glucuronidase activity and trace levels of β-glucosidase and β-xylosidase activities. In conjunction with mutagenesis studies, these structures identify the catalytic residues as Glu(173) (acid base) and Glu(287) (nucleophile), consistent with the retaining mechanism demonstrated by (1)H NMR analysis. Glu(45), Tyr(243), Tyr(292)-Gly(294), and Tyr(334) form the catalytic pocket and provide substrate discrimination. Consistent with this, the Y292A mutation, which affects the interaction between the main chains of Gln(293) and Gly(294) and the GlcA carboxyl group, resulted in significant loss of β-glucuronidase activity while retaining the side activities at wild-type levels. Likewise, although the β-glucuronidase activity of the Y334F mutant is ~200-fold lower (k(cat)/K(m)) than that of the wild-type enzyme, the β-glucosidase activity is actually 3 times higher and the β-xylosidase activity is only 2.5-fold lower than the equivalent parameters for wild type, consistent with a role for Tyr(334) in recognition of the C6 position of GlcA. The involvement of Glu(45) in discriminating against binding of the O-methyl group at the C4 position of GlcA is revealed in the fact that the E45D mutant hydrolyzes PNP-β-GlcA approximately 300-fold slower (k(cat)/K(m)) than does the wild-type enzyme, whereas 4-O-methyl-GlcA-containing oligosaccharides are hydrolyzed only 7-fold slower."
https://openalex.org/W2079458697,"One of the most abundant components of the enterocyte brush border is the actin-based monomeric motor, myosin-1a (Myo1a). Within brush border microvilli, Myo1a carries out a number of critical functions at the interface between membrane and actin cytoskeleton. Proper physiological function of Myo1a depends on its ability to bind to microvillar membrane, an interaction mediated by a C-terminal tail homology 1 (TH1) domain. However, little is known about the mechanistic details of the Myo1a-TH1/membrane interaction. Structure-function analysis of Myo1a-TH1 targeting in epithelial cells revealed that an N-terminal motif conserved among class I myosins and a C-terminal motif unique to Myo1a-TH1 are both required for steady state microvillar enrichment. Purified Myo1a bound to liposomes composed of phosphatidylserine and phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, with moderate affinity in a charge-dependent manner. Additionally, peptides of the N- and C-terminal regions required for targeting were able to compete with Myo1a for binding to highly charged liposomes in vitro. Single molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy showed that these motifs are also necessary for slowing the membrane detachment rate in cells. Finally, Myo1a-TH1 co-localized with both lactadherin-C2 (a phosphatidylserine-binding protein) and PLCδ1-PH (a phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-binding protein) in microvilli, but only lactaderin-C2 expression reduced brush border targeting of Myo1a-TH1. Together, our results suggest that Myo1a targeting to microvilli is driven by membrane binding potential that is distributed throughout TH1 rather than localized to a single motif. These data highlight the diversity of mechanisms that enable different class I myosins to target membranes in distinct biological contexts."

In particular, coordinated migration of NPCs patterns the cortical brain layers (1Nadarajah B. Parnavelas J.G. Modes of neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex.Nat. Rev.

NPCs migrate radially to the cortical plate (CP) along the radial glial fiber from the ventricular zone (VZ), in which NPCs proliferate with multipotency and self-renewal. This process is called radial migration. NPCs extend their leading process in the direction of migration, which is followed by nucleokinesis. Nucleokinesis in migrating cells depends on microtubule dynamics, which is regulated by several signaling molecules (3Lambert de Rouvroit C. Goffinet A.M. Neuronal migration.Mech.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest family of seven-transmembrane receptors, transduce extracellular signals into intracellular signaling events. GPCRs are involved in a variety of physiological processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Some GPCRs have been suggested to regulate cell migration during brain development; for example, CXCR4, a chemokine GPCR for stroma cell-derived factor-1, regulates tangential migration (7Borrell V.

Although several reports indicate that GPCR signaling is involved in NPC migration, the mechanism by which GPCR signaling regulates migration has not been clarified. Previously, we demonstrated that the endothelin receptor type B transduces the signal for the inhibition of NPC migration through the Gq and JNK pathway (9Mizuno N. Kokubu H. Sato M. Nishimura A.

Phosphorylation of DCX by PKA or MARK/Par1 at Ser-47, which is located in the first DCX domain, decreases the binding affinity of DCX for microtubules. Interestingly, mutation of Ser-47 to Arg was found in a lissencephaly patient (15Gleeson J.G. Allen K.M. Fox J.W. Lamperti E.D. Berkovic S. Scheffer I. Cooper E.C. Dobyns W.B. Minnerath S.R.

In addition, the mutation of Ser-47 to Glu, which acts as a phospho-mimic mutation, promotes the interaction of DCX with an actin-binding protein, neurabin2/spinophilin (25Tsukada M. Prokscha A.

These results highlighted DCX as a candidate downstream molecule in the G protein-signaling pathways that may act as a key regulator in orchestrating microtubule and actin dynamics. Lamellipodia are formed by actin assembly and induced by activation of a Rho family small GTPase, Rac. Lamellipodia at the leading edge are essential for cell migration. However, the mechanism of coordinated regulation of microtubule and actin dynamics, which is important for cell migration in response to GPCR stimulation, remains unclear. Here, we first utilized a slice culture system of embryonic cerebral cortex to investigate the action of the G protein-signaling pathway in the developing mouse brain. We revealed that Gs-PKA signaling promotes radial migration. Moreover, we found that pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating protein (PACAP) is a candidate endogenous positive regulator of the radial migration. Next, we focused on DCX as a downstream molecule of Gs signaling. PACAP and Gs-PKA signals induced the phosphorylation of DCX at Ser-47 and promoted neuronal cell migration. Unexpectedly, DCX phosphorylated by PKA stimulated lamellipodium formation in NPCs in a Rac-dependent manner. Our data indicate that phosphorylated DCX is released from microtubules and then interacts with a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). These results indicate a dual reciprocal role for DCX phosphorylation in the regulation of microtubule and actin dynamics for proper brain lamination.

Cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with B27, 1 mg/ml BSA, 2 μg/ml heparin, 20 ng/ml EGF, and 20 ng/ml basic FGF at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HEK293T cells and COS7 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method. The Neon transfection system (Invitrogen) was used to transfect NPCs. Total RNA was extracted from E16.5 mouse brains using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT20) and Superscript ΙΙΙ (Invitrogen). DCX cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GAAGATCTATGGAACTTGATTTTGGACATTTTG-3′ and 5′-CTTCAAGCTTTCACATGGAATCGCCAAG-3′. Full-length DCX cDNA was inserted into plasmids including pCMV5 containing an N-terminal FLAG tag, pmCherry-C1 (Clontech), pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), and the pCold-GST vector (27Hayashi K. Kojima C. pCold-GST vector. A novel cold-shock vector containing GST tag for soluble protein production.Protein Expr. Purif. 2008; 62: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which was generously provided by Dr. Kojima (Osaka University). Point mutants of DCX at Ser-47 were generated using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the following primers: S47A, 5′-GAACCTTGCAGGCATTAGCTAATGAGAAGAAGGCCAAG-3′; S47E, 5′-GAACCTTGCAGGCATTAGAGAATGAGAAGAAGGCCAAG-3′; and S47R, 5′-GAACCTTGCAGGCATTAAGAAATGAGAAGAAGGCCAAG-3′. To construct adenoviral plasmids harboring shRNA against DCX, annealed oligonucleotides for murine DCX were inserted into the Mlu1/Hind3 sites of the pRNAT-H1.1/Adeno vector (GenScript), an adenoviral siRNA shuttle vector. Recombination of the adenoviral vector was performed using the AdEasy XL Adenoviral Vector System (Stratagene). The recombined adenovirus vector was amplified with XL10-Gold Ultracompetent cells (Stratagene). The purified adenovirus vector was digested with Pac1 and transfected into HEK293 cells to produce recombinant adenovirus particles. The sequences of each shRNA adenoviral vector were: sh-RNA-1, 5′-CGCGTCCGGAGTGCGCTACATTTATATTTTCAAGAGAAATATAAATGTAGCGCACTCCTTTTTA-3′; sh-RNA-4, 5′-CGCGTCCGTACGTTTCTACCGCAATGTTTTCAAGAGAAACATTGCGGTAGAAACGTACTTTTTA-3′; sh-3′-UTR-DCX (17Bai J.

NPCs were infected with an adenovirus producing shRNA against the 3′-UTR of DCX. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were infected with adenoviruses harboring DCX cDNA (wild-type and mutant forms lacking the 3′-UTR). Neurospheres infected for a total of 72 h were trypsinized, and 1 × 105 cells were placed on an 8-μm-pore-size transwell (BD Biosciences) coated with 100 μg/ml poly-d-lysine, together with the reagents indicated under “Results,” and incubated for 16 h. Cells on the top side of the filters were removed using a cotton bud, and the filters were then fixed and stained with Giemsa solution. The number of stained cells on the bottom surface of the filters was counted. To investigate the co-localization of wild-type and mutant DCX with microtubules, we prepared free tubulin and microtubule fractions using the sequential extraction method as described previously (28Solomon F. Direct identification of microtubule-associated proteins by selective extraction of cultured cells.Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with PM2G buffer (0.1 m PIPES (pH 6.9), 15% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA) and were permeabilized with PM2G buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 at 37 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min at room temperature, the supernatants were collected as the free tubulin fraction. The precipitates were incubated in PM2G buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 50 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 15 min. Finally, the microtubule fraction was collected as precipitates by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min. Time-lapse images of living cells were captured using AxioObserver (Carl Zeiss) equipped with an incubation chamber. NPCs were cultured in Leibovitz medium (Invitrogen) with a B27 supplement and 1 mg/ml BSA on a glass-bottomed dish (Greiner bio-one) coated with 100 μm poly-d-lysine and 10 μm laminin. Cells were analyzed every 10 s for 5 min with a 100 × objective lens. Imaging data were stored as files in AxioVision (Carl Zeiss). Tubulin polymerization was performed in 50 μl at 37 °C using the Tubulin Polymerization Assay kit (Cytoskeleton). Purified DCX protein (2.5 μg for each sample) was added to a solution including 2 μg/μl tubulin and fluorescent dye. Fluorescence intensity was measured every 60 s for 1 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS7 cells expressing wild-type or mutant DCX were grown on a glass coverslip (Matsunami) until 30% confluent and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Fixed cells were washed 3 times with PBS for 5 min, and permeabilization and blocking were performed with blocking buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 10% FBS in PBS) for 1 h. Cells were incubated with a primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 2 h and then washed with PBS three times for 5 min. A monoclonal antibody against β-tubulin (T4026, Sigma) was used at 1:250 dilution. The cells were then stained with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 at 1:1000 dilution for 2 h. The cells were then washed with PBS, and each coverslip was mounted with PermaFluor Mounting Medium (Thermo Scientific). Cells were observed using AxioObserver (Carl Zeiss) with a 63 × objective lens. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein concentration of each lysate was quantified using the Bradford protein assay and adjusted to 1 mg/ml. The lysates (10 μg protein/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto an Immobilon PVDF membrane (Millipore). Membranes were probed with primary antibodies against DCX (C-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), β-tubulin (Sigma), β-actin (Nacalai Tesque), and FLAG epitope (Sigma). Band intensity was quantified using multigauge software (Fujifilm). To express recombinant proteins of wild-type and mutant DCX, their cDNAs were inserted into modified pCold-I-GST plasmids (27Hayashi K. Kojima C. pCold-GST vector. A novel cold-shock vector containing GST tag for soluble protein production.Protein Expr. Purif. 2008; 62: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Protein expression of His-GST-tagged DCX in the BL21 (DE3) codon plus strain was induced by 0.1 mm IPTG at 16 °C for 24 h. Proteins were extracted in PBS with sonication. Soluble proteins were loaded onto Glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B (GE Healthcare) and gently rotated for 2 h. The beads were then washed with a wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF), and bound proteins were eluted with 40 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF. Eluted DCX proteins were dialyzed against the elution buffer without glutathione. In some experiments, untagged DCX proteins were used. Each recombinant His-GST-DCX was cleaved by PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare). The released His-GST and the protease were removed by Glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), respectively. Rac1 activation was analyzed by a modification of a protocol described previously (29Woodcock S.A. Jones R.C. Edmondson R.D. Malliri A. A modified tandem affinity purification technique identifies that 14-3-3 proteins interact with Tiam1, an interaction which controls Tiam1 stability.J. Proteome Res. 2009; 8: 5629-5641Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). NPCs were treated with 5 μm PACAP antagonist or 10 μm KT5720 for 30 min before 50 nm PACAP stimulation for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS and then lysed with GST-FISH buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF). When HEK293T cells were used for the assay, they were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant DCX. Two days after transfection, lysates were prepared and incubated with 1 μg of GST-PAK-CRIB or GST protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B (GE Healthcare) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with GST-FISH buffer three times, and the proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Rac1 antibody. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids harboring myc-Asef2 and FLAG-tagged wild-type and mutant DCX. After 48 h, cells were collected, and lysates were prepared with lysis buffer. Cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with 1 μg of anti-FLAG antibody and protein-G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with lysis buffer six times, and immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide. Eluted proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with M2 and 9E10 antibodies. We utilized an E16.5 cerebral cortex slice culture system to investigate the action of GPCR-mediated signals in the developing mouse brain. Cells in the VZ were infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing GFP to monitor their radial migration (9Mizuno N. Kokubu H. Sato M. Nishimura A. Yamauchi J. Kurose H. Itoh H. G protein-coupled receptor signaling through Gq and JNK negatively regulates neural progenitor cell migration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 12365-12370Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Infected cells subsequently migrated from the VZ to the CP for 3–4 days in culture. To evaluate the roles of G protein signaling in radial migration, we examined the effect of C-terminal peptides of the G protein α subunit (Gα-ct) with GFP (Fig. 1, A and B). Each G protein α subunit can selectively inhibit receptor-G protein coupling (26Maruyama Y. Nishida M. Sugimoto Y. Tanabe S. Turner J.H. Kozasa T. Wada T. Nagao T. Kurose H. Gα12/13 mediates α1-adrenergic receptor-induced cardiac hypertrophy.Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Infection by adenoviruses harboring Gαs-ct inhibited radial migration, whereas Gαi-ct, Gαq-ct, and Gα12-ct did not. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a common intracellular second messenger downstream of Gαs. To confirm the involvement of cAMP in the regulation of radial migration, we examined the effect of dibutyryl-cAMP (dbcAMP) and of forskolin (Fsk), which is an activator of adenylyl cyclase. The inhibitory effect of Gαs-ct on radial migration was attenuated by both dbcAMP and Fsk (Fig. 1, C and D), and PKA inhibitor KT5720 also inhibited radial migration (supplemental Fig. 1). These results indicated that Gs, cAMP, and PKA promote radial migration during brain development. The next goal prompted by these results was to identify the endogenous Gs-coupled receptor ligand that is involved in radial migration. Among the many ligands for Gs-coupled receptor, pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) is known to act as an anti-mitogenic signal in the developing cerebral cortex (30Suh J. Lu N. Nicot A. Tatsuno I. DiCicco-Bloom E. PACAP is an anti-mitogenic signal in developing cerebral cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 123-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the embryonic brain, the PACAP receptor PAC1 is expressed at very high levels in the VZ, whereas PACAP is expressed in the post-mitotic parenchyma (31Jaworski D.M. Proctor M.D. Developmental regulation of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and PAC(1) receptor mRNA expression in the rat central nervous system.Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2000; 120: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). GFP-labeled cells in 2 day in vitro slices mainly stayed in the intermediate zone. As expected, PACAP promoted neuronal progenitor migration dose-dependently (Fig. 1, E and F). Moreover, the PACAP antagonist inhibited radial migration in slice cultures at 4 days in vitro (Fig. 1, G and H). These results indicated that G protein-coupled receptor signaling positively regulates NPC migration through Gs and PKA and that PACAP is an endogenous positive regulator of radial migration. The positive effect of PACAP on neuronal cell migration was also observed in a Boyden chamber assay with primary-cultured NPCs. PACAP increased cell migration to approximately twice that for unstimulated cells (Fig. 2A). This effect was completely blocked by the PACAP antagonist and KT5720. Next, we focused on DCX. It has been reported that DCX is phosphorylated by PKA at Ser-47 in vitro (24Schaar B.T. Kinoshita K. McConnell S.K. Doublecortin microtubule affinity is regulated by a balance of kinase and phosphatase activity at the leading edge of migrating neurons.Neuron. 2004; 41: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and that DCX knockdown using the RNAi in utero electroporation system suppresses radial migration (17Bai J.

Isolates expressing pneumococcal serotype 9A arise from precursors expressing wcjE-associated serotype 9V through loss-of-function mutation to wcjE. To define the biosynthetic role of 9V wcjE, we characterized the structure and serological properties of serotype 9V and 9A capsule polysaccharide (PS). NMR data revealed that both 9V and 9A PS are composed of an identical pentasaccharide repeat unit, as reported previously. However, in sharp contrast to previous studies on 9A PS being devoid of any O-acetylation, we identified O-acetylation of α-glucuronic acid and α-glucose in 9A PS. In addition, 9V PS also contained -CH(2) O-acetylation of β-N-acetylmannosamine, a modification that disappeared following in vitro recombinatorial deletion of wcjE. We also show that serotyping sera and monoclonal antibodies specific for 9V and 9A bound capsule PS in an O-acetate-dependent manner. Furthermore, IgG and to a lesser extent IgM from human donors immunized with serotype 9V PS displayed stronger binding to 9V compared with 9A PS. We conclude that serotype 9V wcjE mediates 6-O-acetylation of β-N-acetylmannosamine. This PS modification can be selectively targeted by antibodies in immunized individuals, identifying a potential selective advantage for wcjE inactivation and serotype 9A emergence."

To evaluate the relative contributions of pyrimidine biosynthesis and salvage to pyrimidine homeostasis in both life cycle stages of Leishmania donovani, individual mutant lines deficient in either carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS), the first enzyme in pyrimidine biosynthesis, uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT), a salvage enzyme, or both CPS and UPRT were constructed. The Δcps lesion conferred pyrimidine auxotrophy and a growth requirement for medium supplementation with one of a plethora of pyrimidine nucleosides or nucleobases, although only dihydroorotate or orotate could circumvent the pyrimidine auxotrophy of the Δcps/Δuprt double knockout. The Δuprt null mutant was prototrophic for pyrimidines but could not salvage uracil or any pyrimidine nucleoside. The capability of the Δcps parasites to infect mice was somewhat diminished but still robust, indicating active pyrimidine salvage by the amastigote form of the parasite, but the Δcps/Δuprt mutant was completely attenuated with no persistent parasites detected after a 4-week infection. Complementation of the Δcps/Δuprt clone with either CPS or UPRT restored infectivity. These data establish that an intact pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway is essential for the growth of the promastigote form of L. donovani in culture, that all uracil and pyrimidine nucleoside salvage in the parasite is mediated by UPRT, and that both the biosynthetic and salvage pathways contribute to a robust infection of the mammalian host by the amastigote.

To support processive repeat synthesis, it has been proposed that coordination occurs between DNA interactions with the telomerase RNA template, the active site in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) core, a TERT N-terminal (TEN) domain, and additional subunits of the telomerase holoenzyme required for telomere elongation in vivo. The roles of TEN domain surface residues in primer binding and product elongation have been studied largely using assays of minimal recombinant telomerase enzymes, which lack holoenzyme subunits that properly fold and conformationally stabilize the ribonucleoprotein and/or control its association with telomere substrates in vivo. Here, we use Tetrahymena telomerase holoenzyme reconstitution in vitro to assess TEN domain sequence requirements in the physiological enzyme context. We find that TEN domain sequence substitutions in the Tetrahymena telomerase holoenzyme influence synthesis initiation and elongation rate but not processivity. Functional and direct physical interaction assays pinpoint a conserved TEN domain surface required for holoenzyme subunit association and for high repeat addition processivity. Our results add to the understanding of telomerase holoenzyme architecture and TERT domain functions with direct implications for the unique mechanism of single-stranded repeat synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2058458147,"J-proteins are obligate cochaperones of Hsp70s and stimulate their ATPase activity via the J-domain. Although the functions of J-proteins have been well understood in the context of Hsp70s, their additional co-evolved ""physiological functions"" are still elusive. We report here the solution structure and mechanism of novel iron-mediated functional roles of human Dph4, a type III J-protein playing a vital role in diphthamide biosynthesis and normal development. The NMR structure of Dph4 reveals two domains: a conserved J-domain and a CSL-domain connected via a flexible linker-helix. The linker-helix modulates the conformational flexibility between the two domains, regulating thereby the protein function. Dph4 exhibits a unique ability to bind iron in tetrahedral coordination geometry through cysteines of its CSL-domain. The oxidized Fe-Dph4 shows characteristic UV-visible and electron paramagnetic resonance spectral properties similar to rubredoxins. Iron-bound Dph4 (Fe-Dph4) also undergoes oligomerization, thus potentially functioning as a transient ""iron storage protein,"" thereby regulating the intracellular iron homeostasis. Remarkably, Fe-Dph4 exhibits vital redox and electron carrier activity, which is critical for important metabolic reactions, including diphthamide biosynthesis. Further, we observed that Fe-Dph4 is conformationally better poised to perform Hsp70-dependent functions, thus underlining the significance of iron binding in Dph4. Yeast Jjj3, a functional ortholog of human Dph4 also shows a similar iron-binding property, indicating the conserved nature of iron sequestration across species. Taken together, our findings provide invaluable evidence in favor of additional co-evolved specialized functions of J-proteins, previously not well appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2064587167,"Contrary to the accepted dogma that ATP is the canonical phosphate donor in aminoglycoside kinases and protein kinases, it was recently demonstrated that all members of the bacterial aminoglycoside 2′′-phosphotransferase IIIa (APH(2′′)) aminoglycoside kinase family are unique in their ability to utilize GTP as a cofactor for antibiotic modification. Here we describe the structural determinants for GTP recognition in these enzymes. The crystal structure of the GTP-dependent APH(2′′)-IIIa shows that although this enzyme has templates for both ATP and GTP binding superimposed on a single nucleotide specificity motif, access to the ATP-binding template is blocked by a bulky tyrosine residue. Substitution of this tyrosine by a smaller amino acid opens access to the ATP template. Similar GTP binding templates are conserved in other bacterial aminoglycoside kinases, whereas in the structurally related eukaryotic protein kinases this template is less conserved. The aminoglycoside kinases are important antibiotic resistance enzymes in bacteria, whose wide dissemination severely limits available therapeutic options, and the GTP binding templates could be exploited as new, previously unexplored targets for inhibitors of these clinically important enzymes."

Zfp36l2 is a member of the tristetraprolin (TTP) family of CCCH tandem zinc finger proteins that can bind to transcripts containing AU-rich elements (ARE), resulting in deadenylation and destabilization of these transcripts. I show here that the mouse Zfp36l2 is composed of two exons and a single intron, encoding a polypeptide of 484 amino acids.

Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in a lethal phenotype at approximately embryonic day 11, mainly due to failure of chorioallantoic fusion (12Stumpo D.J. Byrd N.A. Phillips R.S. Ghosh S.

Recently, a fourth member of this family, Zfp36l3, has been identified; its function is currently unknown, but its expression seems to be restricted to the rodent yolk sac and placenta (13Blackshear P.J.

These CCCH proteins can bind to the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR) of certain mRNAs containing class II AU-rich elements (ARE, UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A)) through their zinc fingers. Binding is then followed by degradation of the target mRNAs (15Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Evidence that tristetraprolin binds to AU-rich elements and promotes the deadenylation and destabilization of tumor necrosis factor α mRNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), ultimately resulting in decreased levels of translated protein (5Blackshear P.J. Tristetraprolin and other CCCH tandem zinc finger proteins in the regulation of mRNA turnover.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Insight into one biological role for the third family member, Zfp36l2, came from a mouse model in which homozygous mutant females expressing a truncated form of Zfp36l2 (ΔN-Zfp36l2) lacking the amino-terminal 29 amino acids (29NTD) exhibited complete infertility (4Ramos S.B. Stumpo D.J. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Bock C.B. Ribeiro-Neto F. Blackshear P.J. The CCCH tandem zinc-finger protein Zfp36l2 is crucial for female fertility and early embryonic development.Development. 2004; 131: 4883-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These females cycled and ovulated normally, and their ova could be fertilized; however, when they were crossed with WT males, their embryos were able to undergo the initial cleavage step but remained arrested at the two-cell stage. Because Xenopus Zfp36l2 (XC3H-3) can bind to and destabilize certain mRNAs in cell-free assays (16Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. Interactions of CCCH zinc finger proteins with mRNA. Binding of tristetraprolin-related zinc finger proteins to AU-rich elements and destabilization of mRNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and embryonic progression beyond the two-cell stage requires degradation of maternal transcripts coupled to zygotic gene activation (17Bachvarova R. De Leon V. Polyadenylated RNA of mouse ova and loss of maternal RNA in early development.Dev. Biol. 1980; 74: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18Clegg K.B. Pikó L.

Regulation of zygotic gene activation in the mouse.BioEssays. 1993; 15: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), I have suggested that Zfp36l2 could mediate the destabilization of specific maternal transcripts in early embryonic development. Although the precise role played by the amino terminus of Zfp36l2 remains largely unknown, this sequence may contain a functional domain that is of critical importance for the control of early embryonic cell proliferation. The correct structure of the gene in the mouse has also been uncertain. Previous findings from the ΔN-Zfp36l2 mutant model (4Ramos S.B. Stumpo D.J. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Bock C.B. Ribeiro-Neto F. Blackshear P.J. The CCCH tandem zinc-finger protein Zfp36l2 is crucial for female fertility and early embryonic development.Development. 2004; 131: 4883-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) suggested that mouse Zfp36l2 gene contains two exons, as seen in the human gene (20Ino T. Yasui H. Hirano M. Kurosawa Y. Identification of a member of the TIS11 early response gene family at the insertion point of a DNA fragment containing a gene for the T-cell receptor β chain in an acute T-cell leukemia.Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2705-2710PubMed Google Scholar). However, the only published report on the mouse Zfp36l2 gene described a cDNA of 1,200 nucleotides originating from a single exon (1Varnum B.C. Ma Q.F. Chi T.H. Fletcher B. Herschman H.R. The TIS11 primary response gene is a member of a gene family that encodes proteins with a highly conserved sequence containing an unusual Cys-His repeat.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This would be similar to the situation seen with Zfp36l3 (13Blackshear P.J. Phillips R.S. Ghosh S. Ramos S.B. Ramos S.V. Richfield E.K. Lai W.S. Zfp36l3, a rodent X chromosome gene encoding a placenta-specific member of the tristetraprolin family of CCCH tandem zinc finger proteins.Biol. Reprod. 2005; 73: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this report, I confirm that the mouse gene, like the human, is composed of two exons separated by a single intron. I also show that the ΔN-Zfp36l2 protein appears to be more resistant to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced down-regulation than the WT protein. A mouse genomic Zfp36l2 clone (MG-TIS11D) was obtained as described previously (21Phillips R.S. Ramos S.B. Blackshear P.J. Members of the tristetraprolin family of tandem CCCH zinc finger proteins exhibit CRM1-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11606-11613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The proposed 3′-UTR of the transcript, corresponding to bp 2202–3537 of GenBankTM RefSeq NM_00100186.2, was generated using 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The full-length cDNA was constructed by removing exon 1, the single intron, and the beginning of exon 2 from this genomic clone and replacing them by an EST clone (GenBankTM accession number AI327503) that contained a spliced sequence in which exon 1 was fused with the beginning of exon 2, as described (21Phillips R.S. Ramos S.B. Blackshear P.J. Members of the tristetraprolin family of tandem CCCH zinc finger proteins exhibit CRM1-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11606-11613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Plasmid CMV.mZfp36l2-HA.tag, encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) tag fused to the carboxyl-terminal end of mouse Zfp36l2, was constructed by removing a fragment of 120 bp (SstI-SstI fragment) at the 3′ end of the cDNA and replacing it with an ∼120-bp PCR product containing an HA sequence in-frame with the last amino acid of Zfp36l2 followed by a stop codon and an XbaI site. After sequencing, the Zfp36l2-HA was excised from the pSK− vector and introduced into the KpnI-XbaI sites of the CMV.BGH3′/pBS+-modified vector (15Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Evidence that tristetraprolin binds to AU-rich elements and promotes the deadenylation and destabilization of tumor necrosis factor α mRNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Similarly, a Zfp36l2 sequence fused with GFP was constructed as described above, except that the 120-bp fragment was replaced by a PCR product in which the stop codon was removed and a PspOMI site was introduced. After the 3′ end was sequenced to confirm the desired mutation, the EcoRI-PspOMI fragment was excised and introduced in-frame with GFP in the pEGFP-N1 vector from Clontech. The ΔN-Zfp36l2-GFP vector was constructed by PCR primer-overlapping mutagenesis, in which a KpnI site was created immediately before the second methionine; after sequencing, the ΔN-Zfp36l2 insert was introduced as described above into the pEGFP-N1 vector. Dissected mouse tissues were rapidly frozen and pulverized in liquid nitrogen and processed using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen to extract total cellular RNA, according to the directions of the manufacturer. RNA samples (10 μg) were separated by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels and used for Northern blotting (22Stumpo D.J. Graff J.M. Albert K.A. Greengard P. Blackshear P.J. Molecular cloning, characterization, and expression of a cDNA encoding the “80- to 87-kDa” myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate. A major cellular substrate for protein kinase C.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 4012-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The nylon membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled Zfp36l2 probes comprising exon 1, the single intron, or exon 2 as described (4Ramos S.B. Stumpo D.J. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Bock C.B. Ribeiro-Neto F. Blackshear P.J. The CCCH tandem zinc-finger protein Zfp36l2 is crucial for female fertility and early embryonic development.Development. 2004; 131: 4883-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Northern blots were analyzed using a PhosphorImager Typhoon 8600 and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). A total of 1 μg of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer's instructions. To quantify TTP and Zfp36l2, 9 ng of cDNA was combined with predesigned primer/probe sets and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). For the housekeeping gene, 4 ng of cDNA was used to detect GAPDH. All reactions were performed in triplicate in 96-well plates. Real time assays were run on an ABI 7000 sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems). To allow the linearization of the plasmid at the 3′ end using a preferred restriction enzyme, a pBluescript II SK− plasmid was constructed containing a T7 promoter at the 5′ end preceding the Zfp36l2 cDNA, followed by a unique restriction enzyme site (HindIII) downstream of the 3′ end of the stop codon. The RNA was transcribed from 1 μg of linearized plasmids (Zfp36l2 cDNA digested with HindIII) and used as a template to prepare in vitro translated 35S-cysteine-labeled Zfp36l2 in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system or in wheat germ extract (both from Promega Biotech). The translated protein labeled with 35S-cysteine was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis; the gel was then fixed and incubated with Autofluor (National Diagnostics), dried, and exposed to film. Primary embryonic fibroblasts were prepared from embryonic day 14–15 mouse embryos, and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) were prepared from adult mice as described (7Carballo E. Gilkeson G.S. Blackshear P.J. Bone marrow transplantation reproduces the tristetraprolin-deficiency syndrome in recombination activating gene-2(−/−) mice. Evidence that monocyte/macrophage progenitors may be responsible for TNFα overproduction.J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Marrow cells were flushed from femurs of individual animals (2–5-month-old WT and ΔN-Zfp36l2 mice) and cultured in standard medium containing colony-stimulating factor for 3–4 weeks. Animal care procedures were in accordance with institution guidelines for animal use at NIEHS (National Institutes of Health) and University of North Carolina. Mouse RAW 264.7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 μg/ml, Sigma) for various times in four independent experiments. Finally, RAW cells were pretreated with 50 μm cycloheximide (Sigma) for 15 min to inhibit protein synthesis before LPS stimulation. HEK 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Transient transfection of 1 × 106 cells with different Zfp36l2 constructs in calcium-phosphate precipitates was performed as described previously (15Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Evidence that tristetraprolin binds to AU-rich elements and promotes the deadenylation and destabilization of tumor necrosis factor α mRNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The transfection mixture was allowed to stay on the cells for 20 h and then removed; after a further 24-h incubation period, cells were lysed for protein extraction. Cytosolic protein extracts from cell lines, primary cells, and HEK 293 cells transfected with different constructs were prepared in a buffer solution comprised of 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate (pH 8.2), 0.25 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mm benzamidine-HCl, plus the following protease inhibitors: 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 μm pepstatin, 2 μm leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. The amount of protein was measured using a Bio-Rad assay. Cell labeling and immunoprecipitation protocols have been described in detail elsewhere (6Taylor G.A. Carballo E. Lee D.M. Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Patel D.D. Schenkman D.I. Gilkeson G.S. Broxmeyer H.E. Haynes B.F. Blackshear P.J.

Briefly, confluent 100- or 60-mm plates of cells were serum-deprived overnight in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), then preincubated for 1 h in phosphorus-free DMEM without BSA, and stimulated with 10% (v/v) dialyzed FCS in the presence of [32P]orthophosphoric acid (0.2 mCi/ml) for 2 h. Next, the cells were briefly sonicated in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 0.10 m NaCl, 0.05 m NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors. Protein extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using protein A-Sepharose beads and a polyclonal peptide antiserum, N2-Zfp36l2-AS. Precipitated proteins were eluted from the beads, boiled in 4× loading buffer, and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were dried and used for autoradiography. Four to 25 μg of protein extracts from HEK 293 cells overexpressing Zfp36l2, or 400–500 μg of protein extracts containing endogenous Zfp36l2, were mixed with a 4× SDS loading buffer, boiled, and then loaded onto 10 or 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blots were performed using standard techniques. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 and then probed with different rabbit antisera generated against synthetic peptides. Two amino- and two carboxyl-terminal peptides, for a total of four, were synthesized based on the Zfp36l2 protein sequence (Fig. 1B). Each of the four peptides were individually conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin as a protein carrier and then injected into two different rabbits to produce a total of eight different rabbit antisera. Among the four peptides, three were unique to Zfp36l2 amino acid sequences and one was shared with another family member, Zfp36l1. The extreme amino-terminal peptide, corresponding to amino acids 5–16 translated from exon 1 (LLSPFYDIDFLC), was named N1-Zfp36l2-AS. The other amino-terminal sequence was located after the second methionine in the beginning of exon 2, corresponding to amino acids 58–80 (ASNLHALAHPVPSPGSCSPKFPG, N2-Zfp36l2-AS). The Zfp36l2 carboxyl-terminal specific antiserum was raised using a peptide corresponding to amino acids 423–437 (PAPPSPPFGFQLPRR, C1-Zfp36l2-AS); the fourth, an extreme carboxyl-terminal sequence shared between Zfp36l2 and Zfp36l1 and corresponding to amino acids 469–484 (RRLPIFSRLSISDD) of mouse Zfp36l2, was used to raise a common carboxyl-terminal antiserum (C2-Zfp36l2-AS). Each primary antibody was used diluted to 1:10,000 or 1:2,500 for overexpressed or endogenous protein samples, respectively. Incubation of the membranes with the secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP-conjugated (Bio-Rad) was diluted 1:25,000 or 1:50,000 and developed with a SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein extracts prepared from HEK 293 cells transfected with either vector alone (BS+), Zfp36l2, or Zfp36l2-HA constructs driven by the CMV promoter were incubated with 2 × 105 cpm of a mTNF-ARE RNA probe (based on bp 1309–1332 of GenBankTM accession number X02611), at room temperature for 20 min in 20 μl of lyses buffer (without a protease inhibitor). Heparin and yeast tRNA were added to final concentrations of 0.5 μg/μl and 50 ng/liter, respectively, for an additional 10 min. The RNA not associated with protein was digested with 100 units of RNase T1 (Invitrogen) for 20 min at room temperature. The resultant reaction mixture was then loaded onto a 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 250 V for 90 min in 0.4× Tris borate/EDTA buffer (15Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Evidence that tristetraprolin binds to AU-rich elements and promotes the deadenylation and destabilization of tumor necrosis factor α mRNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). For the gel supershift assay, an HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or the N2-Zfp36l2 antiserum was added to the first incubation step together with the protein extract and the labeled probe for 20 min at room temperature. For the assays of Zfp36l2 in vitro translated using wheat germ extracts, a human TNF-ARE RNA probe (1331–1389 bp of NM_000594.2) was used. Assay and RNA probes have been described previously (23Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. Tristetraprolin and its family members can promote the cell-free deadenylation of AU-rich element-containing mRNAs by poly(A) ribonuclease.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3798-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, all three probes, ARE-A50, ARE, and V, contained the same 5′ sequences. Probe ARE-A50 consisted of 58 bases transcribed from the multiple cloning sites of the SK− vector, plus 24 bases of the core ARE from the mouse TNF mRNA, followed by 50 adenosines. Probe ARE was identical to ARE-A50 except that it did not contain a poly(A) tail. Probe V (vector) consisted only of 58 bases transcribed from the multiple cloning sites of SK−, but no ARE or poly(A) tail. All plasmids were linearized and used as templates in the Promega riboprobe in vitro transcription system. The capped RNA probes were transcribed in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) and Ribo m7G cap analog (Promega), and the resulting products were separated from free nucleotides on G-50 columns. The reaction mixtures were assembled on ice, and the reaction was started by adding 50 μl of probe (4 × 104 cpm) to 5 μg of protein extracts in 50 μl in an assay buffer (1 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 40 mm KCl, and 5% glycerol). The mixtures were incubated on ice or at 37 °C for 60 min. EDTA at a final concentration of 20 mm was added to terminate the reaction. The final reaction mixture was then extracted once with phenol/chloroform. An aliquot of 60 μl of the aqueous phase was mixed with 60 μl of formamide stop solution (95% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol) and then heated at 70 °C for 5 min. Aliquots of reaction products were analyzed on an 8% acrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. To observe the subcellular localization of Zfp36l2-GFP and ΔN-Zfp36l2-GFP fusion proteins, HEK 293 cells (4 × 104/ml) were plated in two-well (4 cm2) LabTek glass chamber slides (Nagle Nunc International) and transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (16Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. Interactions of CCCH zinc finger proteins with mRNA.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), except for the amount of DNA, 1–10 ng per well of different GFP fusion constructs. The transfection mixture was allowed to stay on the cells for 16 h, and 1–8 h after the removal of the transfection mixture, the cells were rinsed twice at room temperature in PBS, fixed for 10 min in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde, and then rinsed again with PBS before mounting with ProLong Anti-fade (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Slides were dried and examined, and images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Analysis of the mouse genome shows that mouse Zfp36l2 contains two exons, as does the human gene (20Ino T. Yasui H. Hirano M. Kurosawa Y. Identification of a member of the TIS11 early response gene family at the insertion point of a DNA fragment containing a gene for the T-cell receptor β chain in an acute T-cell leukemia.Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2705-2710PubMed Google Scholar), and encodes a 484-amino acid protein (Fig. 1A, panel I). The initial description of mouse Zfp36l2 was from a 1,200-bp cDNA originating from a single exon, resulting in a predicted protein of 367 amino acids; and this protein has been used in other studies (24Johnson B.A. Blackwell T.K.

This cDNA lacked the coding sequence for 29 and 88 amino acids at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends, respectively. I used Northern blot experiments with probes corresponding to exon 1, exon 2, and the 3′-UTR to characterize the WT and mutant transcripts. In the ΔN-Zfp36l2 mutant animals the small exon 1 was knocked out (Fig. 2A) resulting in a truncated protein of 455 amino acids (Fig. 1A, panel II). Cytosolic RNA from WT mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages failed to hybridize with a probe to the intron sequence (Fig. 2B), because this sequence is spliced out in the mature Zfp36l2 transcript.

We have previously shown that Polη plays an important role in the genesis of nontargeted mutations at undamaged DNA sites in cells exposed to the carcinogen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Here, we report that MNNG-induced Polη expression in an interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1)-dependent manner in human cells. Mutagenesis analysis showed that four critical residues (Arg-82, Cys-83, Asn-86, and Ser-87) located in the IRF family conserved DNA binding domain-helix α3 were involved in DNA binding and POLH transactivation by IRF1. Furthermore, Polη up-regulation induced by IRF1 was responsible for the increase of mutation frequency in a SupF shuttle plasmid replicated in the MNNG-exposed cells. Interestingly, IRF1 was acetylated by the histone acetyltransferase CBP in these cells. Lys → Arg substitution revealed that Lys-78 of helix α3 was the major acetylation site, and the IRF1-K78R mutation partially inhibited DNA binding and its transcriptional activity. Thus, we propose that IRF1 activation is responsible for MNNG-induced Polη up-regulation, which contributes to mutagenesis and ultimately carcinogenesis in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1966427446,"Eukaryotic mRNA bears a cap structure (m7GpppX-) at the 5′ terminus crucial for efficient translation and stability. The yeast L-A double-stranded RNA virus furnishes its mRNA with this structure by a novel cap-snatching mechanism in which the virus transfers an m7Gp moiety from host mRNA to the diphosphorylated 5′ terminus of the viral transcript, thus forming on it an authentic cap structure (referred to as cap0) in the budding yeast. This capping reaction is essential for efficient viral expression. His-154 of the capsid protein Gag is involved in the cap transfer. Here we show that the virus can utilize an externally added viral transcript as acceptor in the capping reaction. The acceptor needs to be 5′ diphosphorylated, consistent with the fact that the viral transcript bears diphosphate at the 5′ terminus. A 5′ triphosphorylated or monophosphorylated transcript does not function as acceptor. N7 methylation at the 5′ cap guanine of mRNA is essential for cap donor activity. We also demonstrate that the capping reaction requires the viral polymerase actively engaging in transcription. Because the cap-snatching site of Gag is located at the cytoplasmic surface of the virion, whereas Pol is confined inside the virion, the result indicates coordination between the cap-snatching and polymerization sites. This will allow L-A virus to efficiently produce capsid proteins to form new virions when Pol is actively engaging in transcription. The coordination may also minimize the risk of accidental capping of nonviral RNA when Pol is dormant.

https://openalex.org/W2051473080,"The bacterial Sec protein translocation system catalyzes the transport of unfolded precursor proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. Using a recently developed real time fluorescence-based transport assay, the effects of the number and distribution of positive charges on the transport time and transport efficiency of proOmpA were examined. As expected, an increase in the number of lysine residues generally increased transport time and decreased transport efficiency. However, the observed effects were highly dependent on the polylysine position in the mature domain. In addition, a string of consecutive positive charges generally had a more significant effect on transport time and efficiency than separating the charges into two or more charged segments. Thirty positive charges distributed throughout the mature domain resulted in effects similar to 10 consecutive charges near the N terminus of the mature domain. These data support a model in which the local effects of positive charge on the translocation kinetics dominate over total thermodynamic constraints. The rapid translocation kinetics of some highly charged proOmpA mutants suggest that the charge is partially shielded from the electric field gradient during transport, possibly by the co-migration of counter ions. The transport times of precursors with multiple positively charged sequences, or ""pause sites,"" were fairly well predicted by a local effect model. However, the kinetic profile predicted by this local effect model was not observed. Instead, the transport kinetics observed for precursors with multiple polylysine segments support a model in which translocation through the SecYEG pore is not the rate-limiting step of transport."
