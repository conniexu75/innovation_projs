Nevertheless, it appeared of interest to investigate which is the organism opening the attack on dead leaves falling from, or having fallen from, different trees in autumn."

https://openalex.org/W1971800530,"IN the course of experiments dealing with correlations between structure and effect of cholinergic-blocking (antimuscarine, antinicotinic) actions1,2, it has been found that in the case of compounds with tropeine structure the influence exerted on the effects by different quaternary groups shows great variations. Quaternary derivatives of tropeines possessing local anæsthetic properties, for example, benzoyltropine (= benzoyl-anti-tropine)3, as well as benzoyl-ψ-tropine (= benzoyl-syn-tropine), have been prepared and studied5, special consideration being given to the correlations between stereo-structure and pharmacological effect. Antimuscarine, ganglionic-blocking, curare-like, as well as local anæsthetic actions have been investigated. The effects of the individual compounds are shown in the accompanying table."

https://openalex.org/W2014218810,"Cutter, Dube and Wilson1 have published some interesting information regarding the growth and development of the coconut fruit. Apart from physiological studies on the growth and development of the endosperm tissue, they have detected the presence of free nuclei suspended in the milk, and by slowly centrifuging the milk they have successfully isolated such nuclei in the living state. The present observations have resulted from an attempt to follow up that work to see whether the fruit with its exposed nuclei can be used as a living receptacle for testing the direct effect of antibiotics and other substances on chromosomes. Hitherto, such studies have been confined to onion root tips, which can be made to grow in water."
https://openalex.org/W2084108531,"DURING the development of an embryo, a very important part is probably played by the forces of attachment between cells. Weiss1 in particular has emphasized the importance of interactions between cell surfaces in the processes leading to tissue differentiation. Holtfreter2,3 has shown that the cells of the young amphibian embryo can be dissociated experimentally by alkali-treatment, and Mookerjee et al.4 has made a comparative study of the firmness of cell-attachment both in different species of Urodele and during the course of differentiation of one particular organ, the notochord. A similar type of cell-dissociation has now been shown to occur in the chick embryo."

It seemed of interest to examine whether the simultaneous administration of another hepatic carcinogen has an influence on the carcinogenic activity of the tannic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2028637031,A PRELIMINARY pharmacological investigation of the total alkaloids of Aspidosperma oblongum A.DC. obtained by classical methods has been carried out. A 6 per cent solution of the hydrochlorides in an appropriate isotonic saline at pH 6.8 was used.

https://openalex.org/W2059060045,"DURING the course of some experiments on fœtal rabbits, a very marked constriction was observed in the umbilical cord at the umbilical ring; the abrupt narrowing in this region accompanied the closure of the length of the umbilical vessels in response to traction or to cooling of the cord. A circular band of smooth muscle in the umbilical ring region has been described for the horse1 but for no other animal, and Sir Joseph Barcroft suggested that the structure of the rabbit's umbilical cord should be studied in more detail."

https://openalex.org/W2076197274,"FORMATION of an amylose-type polysaccharide from glucose-1-phosphate by the action of phosphorylase does not take place unless a small amount of starch, glycogen or dextrin is added as the priming agent. The primer, which is sometimes called activator, is required presumably because the enzyme is unable to cause the condensation of glucose-1-phosphate, but acts only by transferring glucose units from glucose-1-phosphate to the non-reducing end of an already existing polysaccharide chain1. There have been reported, however, two exceptions which were claimed to require no added primer in this reaction; one is purified phosphorylase of lima bean, as reported by Green and Stumpf2, and the other is that of sweet potato, as reported by Inoue and Onodera3. In both cases, according to these authors, the addition of different types of primers in various amounts had little or no effect on the initial velocity of this reaction catalysed by respective enzymes. In the case of purified lima bean phosphorylase, the possibility that the enzyme preparation might be contaminated with polysaccharide was excluded, since this preparation could not serve as a source of a polyhexose catalyst for purified potato enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1975825836,"IN the tribe Lactobacteriacea there are two closely related genera—Lactobacillus, which are catalase-negative, and Microbacterium, which are catalase-positive. Representative members of these genera were selected, namely, Lactobacillus pastorianus (ATC 8291) as the catalase-negative bacteria and Microbacterium flavum (ATC 10340) as the catalase-positive bacteria. Both species form distinct colonies and have an optimum temperature near 30° C. The bacteria were reared on Difco's stock culture broth media and buffered with calcium carbonate, and incubated for seven to nine days at 30° C. L. pastorianus was diluted 1–10,000 and M. flavum 1–50,000 with physiological salt solution, and 1 ml. of the solution placed in the centre of a sterile Petri plate. The aliquot was exposed to ultra-violet radiation from a 40-watt tube, model HUVM-30 (American Sterilizer Co., Erie, Pa.), with about 90 per cent of the radiation at 2537 A. The distance from the tube to the bacteria was 43 cm. and time of exposure was at various intervals from 1 to 14 sec. Thirty plates were run for each time of irradiation, and average results are presented in the accompanying graph. Immediately after irradiation, 15–20 ml. of tomato agar was added to the plate and agitated to distribute the bacteria uniformly around the plate. The plates are incubated for seven days at 30° C. and the colonies counted. Controls were those bacteria which were not exposed to ultra-violet radiation."

Curves of subsequent changes in the amount of isotopic excess can be explained and used for calculating the survival curve of red cells, as well as their average time of utilizing the incorporated substance."

https://openalex.org/W1993553160,"THE role of Oscillatoria for purifying freshwater reservoirs is well known. For some years now, I have been applying successfully this biological agent to ‘cleaning up’ amœba cultures. Ordinary laboratory cultures, unless rigidly controlled, tend to become choked with algæ in the course of time. It is a tiresome manipulation to separate out the amœbæ in sufficient numbers when it is desirable to make a quantity of stained preparations, or to secure the large numbers of young amœbæ which are required when a study of mitosis is being made. If, however, among the algal contents one introduces Oscillatoria, the filaments of this grow over and bind together the wheat grains and the algal contents into a cylindrical mass. The rest of the vesicle is quite free from weed; but young amœbæ, some rotifers and small flagellates creep out on to it and multiply, and so a white carpet is formed consisting mainly of amœbæ quite free from debris. These can then be pipetted off into the fixative, or used for a study of mitosis."
