Free-running activity rhythms of the rat were entrained by a daily melatonin injection, with entrainment occurring when the onset of activity coincided with the time of daily injections. When injections were stopped, activity rhythms became free-running again. Thus in pharmacological experiments, the time of day of melatonin administration is crucial."

https://openalex.org/W1982245545,We have cloned a mutant allele of the H–2Kb gene known as H–2Kbml. DNA sequence analysis of this gene shows that it is the result of an intergenic exchange of DNA (gene conversion) which results in the conversion of a short internal segment of the H–2Kb to the corresponding sequence of another H–2 gene. We suggest that this type of gene conversion is widespread in H–2 genes and that it is a major force in the generation of polymorphism in H–2 genes.
https://openalex.org/W2076318901,"We have isolated cDNA and genomic clones containing alpha- and beta-tubulin genes from Trypanosoma brucei. Each clone has been mapped, and the identity of the tubulin genes has been established by cross-hybridization with cloned chicken tubulin genes and by hybridization-selection and translation of trypanosome tubulin mRNA. In contrast with the dispersed organization of tubulin genes in other organisms, trypanosome alpha- and beta-tubulin genes are physically linked and clustered in tandem repeats of approximately 13-17 copies per haploid genome of alternating alpha- and beta-tubulin sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1978206322,"Thirteen mouse substrains genetically transmitting the exogenous Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) at a single locus (Mov locus) have been derived previously. Experiments were performed to investigate whether homozygosity at the Mov loci would be compatible with normal development. Animals heterozygous at an Mov locus were mated, and the genotype of the offspring was analyzed. From parents heterozygous at the loci Mov1 to Mov12, respectively, homozygous offspring were obtained with the expected Mendelian frequency. In contrast, no homozygous offspring or embryos older than day 15 of gestation were obtained from parents heterozygous at the Mov13 locus. When pregnant Mov13 females at day 13 and day 14 of gestation were analyzed, approximately 25% of the embryos were degenerated. Genotyping revealed that these degenerated embryos were invariably homozygous and the normal appearing embryos were either heterozygous or negative for M-MuLV. These results suggest that integration of M-MuLV at the Mov13 locus leads to insertion mutagenesis, resulting in embryonic arrest between day 12 and day 13 of gestation. It is possible that the Mov13 locus represents a gene or gene complex involved in the early embryonic development of the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2032506756,"A diverse range of ultimate chemical carcinogens inhibited the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to hemimethylated DNA in a reaction catalyzed by mouse spleen methyltransferase. The formation of alkali-labile sites in DNA lessened its ability to accept methyl groups in vitro, but the methylation reaction was much less sensitive to thymine dimers or double-strand breaks. Carcinogens induced the formation of alkali-labile DNA lesions, but the degree of methyltransferase inhibition observed was greater than that expected for this damage alone. Certain carcinogens were also capable of direct modification and inactivation of the methyltransferase enzyme. Benzo(a)pyrene treatment of living BALB/3T3 A31 clone 1-13 but not C3H/10T1/2 clone 8 cells resulted in a 12% decrease in total 5-methylcytosine content of cellular DNA. Carcinogenic agents may therefore cause heritable changes in 5-methylcytosine patterns in certain cell types by a variety of mechanisms, including adduct formation, induction of apurinic sites and single-strand breaks and direct inactivation of DNA methyltransferase."

We have cloned the xylE region in Escherichia coli and determined the nucleotide sequence of the DNA fragment of 985 base pairs around the gene. The fragment included only one open translational frame of sufficient length to accommodate the enzyme. The predicted amino acid sequence consisted of 307 residues, and its NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences were in perfect agreement with those of the enzyme recently determined (Nakai, C., Hori, K., Kagamiyama, H., Nakazawa, T., and Nozaki, M. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2916-2922). A mutant plasmid was isolated which did not direct the synthesis of the active enzyme. This plasmid had a DNA region corresponding to the NH2-terminal two-thirds of the polypeptide. From the deduced amino acid sequence, the secondary structure was predicted. Around 10 base pairs upstream from the initiator codon for metapyrocatechase, there was a base sequence which was complementary to the 3'-end of 16 S rRNAs from both E.coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A preferential usage of C- and G-terminated codons was found in the coding region xylE, which contributed to the relatively high G + C content (57%) of this gene."

https://openalex.org/W2011889420,"Efforts in estimating carcinogenic risk in humans from long-term exposure to chemical carcinogens have centered on the problem of low-dose extrapolation. For chemicals with metabolites that interact with DNA, it may be more meaningful to relate tumor response to the concentration of the DNA adducts in the target organ rather than to the applied dose. Many data suggest that the relation between tumor response and concentration of DNA adducts in the target organ may be linear. This implies that the nonlinearities of the dose-response curve for tumor induction may be due to the kinetic processes involved in the formation of carcinogen metabolite--DNA adducts. Of particular importance is the possibility that the kinetic processes may show a nonlinear ""hockey-stick"" like behavior which results from saturation of detoxification or DNA repair processes. The mathematical models typically used for low-dose extrapolation are shown potentially to overestimate risk by several orders of magnitude when nonlinear kinetics are present."
https://openalex.org/W2087213997,"Two lung and two colon carcinoma cell lines of human origin, which contained the same activated rasK transforming gene, expressed abnormal species of p21 that were distinct from the p21 proteins expressed in normal human cells and other human carcinomas. The abnormal species of p21 expressed by three of these cell lines were indistinguishable from each other, but differed from the abnormal p21 expressed by one lung carcinoma cell line. NIH cells transformed by DNAs of these carcinomas expressed the same abnormal p21 species, indicating that these abnormal proteins were encoded by the activated rasK genes detected by transfection. These results indicate that transforming activity of rasK genes in human lung and colon carcinoma cell lines is activated by mutations which alter the structure of their gene products, and that activation of rasK genes can result from different molecular alterations in different individual neoplasms."

https://openalex.org/W2132194645,"Ca-Ca isotopic exchange activity in bovine cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles was measured under equilibrium conditions, i.e. where intra- and extravesicular media have identical compositions. The results demonstrate that the monovalent cations K+, Li+, and Rb+ stimulate the process of Ca-Ca exchange. The presence of monovalent cations increases the Vmax for this process but has little effect on the Km for Ca2+. Maximal stimulation of exchange activity occurs when the monovalent cations are present on both sides of the vesicle membrane; a lesser degree of stimulation is observed when the cations are present at only one membrane surface. Na+ also stimulates Ca-Ca exchange at low concentrations (0.5-8 mM) but at high concentrations causes a marked inhibition. The latter effect is due to a competition between Na+ and Ca2+ for a site on the exchange carrier. The presence of monovalent cations alters the pH profile for Ca-Ca exchange. In the absence of stimulating cations, Ca-Ca exchange activity exhibits a maximum at pH 7.0 and then drops to approximately half the peak value at pH 7.5 or higher. In contrast, the rate of Ca-Ca exchange in the presence of monovalent cations continues to increase as the pH is raised from pH 6 to pH 9. Measurements of 86Rb+ fluxes demonstrate that Rb-stimulated Ca-Ca exchange does not involve the co-transport of Rb+. Monovalent cations produce no stimulation of Na-dependent Ca2+ fluxes (Na-Ca exchange) when present on the same side of the membrane as Ca2+. The results are discussed in terms of an extension of the model for the Na-Ca exchanger that was described in the accompanying paper (Reeves, J.P., and Sutko, J.L. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 3178-3182)."
https://openalex.org/W2140100868,"The initial velocity of Ca2+ uptake via the Na-Ca exchange system in cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles is competitively inhibited by extravesicular Na+. The Hill plots for multisite competitive inhibition are nonlinear, exhibiting a limiting slope of 1 at low Na+ concentrations (less than 20 mM) and 1.6-2.0 at higher concentrations. The Ki for Na+ is approximately 16 mM. Thus, the Ca2+ binding site of the Na-Ca exchange carrier interacts with either 1 or 2 Na+ ions and the binding of a single Na+ is sufficient to block Ca2+ binding. These results, in conjunction with the observation that at least 3 Na+ ions are required at the trans membrane surface to bring about Ca2+ movements by Na-Ca exchange, suggest that the exchange carrier contains two classes of cation binding sites: a divalent site which can bind either 1 Ca2+ or 1-2 Na+ ions and a second site which binds at least one additional Na+. The classical observation that cardiac contractility depends upon the [Ca2+]/[Na+]2 ratio of the extracellular medium can be readily explained in terms of the competitive interactions of Na+ and Ca2+ at the divalent site."

The effects were concentration-dependent, saturable, and labile in the presence of heat or trypsin. The morphological enhancement was produced only by skeletal muscle extract and decreased with developmental age, whereas the cholinergic enhancement was produced by extracts of cerebral cortex and cardiac and skeletal muscle and did not change with age. These changes were specific for ventral cord neurons, but no species specificity was observed with respect to the muscle source or the neuronal target."
https://openalex.org/W2056837195,"Six structural homologs of spermidine and five of its precursor, putrescine, were studied for their ability to prevent cytostasis of cultured L1210 leukemia cells induced by alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a specific inhibitor of putrescine biosynthesis. High-performance liquid chromatography and competition studies with spermidine indicated that the homologs, which vary in the length of the carbon chain separating the amines, penetrated the cells. The structural specificity of the spermidine carrier was defined. Three of the six spermidine homologs supported cell growth during a 48-hour incubation in the presence of DFMO, indicating that a two-carbon extension of spermidine structure was tolerated for biological function. Two of the five putrescine homologs supported growth after being converted by the cells to their respective spermidine homologs. The central nitrogen of spermidine appears to be essential for function since diamines of chain length comparable to that of spermidine did not prevent DFMO cytostasis. No more than 15 percent of the spermidine normally present in L1210 cells was required for cell proliferation in the presence of DFMO."
https://openalex.org/W2015135504,"Clones containing nine different larval and adult globin genes have been isolated from two genomic libraries of Xenopus laevis. They encompass three distinct DNA regions: a 70 kb region containing five genes in the order 5'-alpha Lla-alpha Llb-alpha Al-beta Al-beta Lla-3', all with the same transcriptional polarity; a 40 kb region with three genes, 5'-alpha Llla-alpha Lllb-alpha All-3', again with the same polarity; and a 10 kb segment comprising the beta Llla gene only. The beta All gene has not been found in our libraries. Genetic analysis has revealed two more beta L genes (beta Lllb, beta Lllb). Globin-like sequences have also been isolated, but have not been further characterized. The X. laevis globin gene family thus consists of 12 genes arranged in two clusters, each containing larval and adult alpha and beta genes in a unique, ""symmetrical"" arrangement. Electron microscopic analysis has revealed that Xenopus globin genes also comprise three exons and two introns, but differ from the globin genes of higher vertebrates in that the introns are much larger."
https://openalex.org/W110662270,"The carbohydrate moieties of hen ovomucoid were released as oligosaccharides by hydrazinolysis. The neutral oligosaccharide fraction which comprised about 85% of the total sugar was fractionated into eight oligosaccharide fractions by Bio-Gel P-4 column chromatography. Occurrence of novel penta-antennary oligosaccharides in the larger three fractions was reported in the preceding paper (Yamashita, K., Kamerling, J.P., and Kobata, A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12809-12814). Structural studies of the remaining smaller oligosaccharides indicated that they all have Man alpha 1 leads to 6(Man alpha 1 leads to 3)Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc as their common core. The alpha-mannosyl residues occur either free or as one of the following five groups: GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man, GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4Man, GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4(GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2)Man, GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 6(GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2)Man, and GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 6(GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4)(GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2) Man. In most oligosaccharides, a beta-N-acetylglucosamine residue is linked at the C-4 position of the beta-mannosyl residue of the core. The structural characteristic of the sugar chains of hen ovomucoid indicated that they are not formed by the ordinary processing pathway of the asparagine-linked sugar chains."
https://openalex.org/W2035893537,"Calcium ions activate muscle contraction. The mechanism depends on the calcium sensitivity of the proteins that regulate contraction. Evidence is presented for the reverse phenomenon, where contraction modulates calcium sensitivity. Increasing the force level increased calcium sensitivity in intact fibers showing that the relation between force and calcium is not unique. A particular calcium concentration can maintain a higher force level than it can create. The results were confirmed in skinned fiber experiments. Transient reduction of the force led to a transient reduction in calcium binding, suggesting a simple mechanism for the hysteresis."
https://openalex.org/W1646234539,"Although nonsteroidal antiestrogens of the triphenylethylene type are generally considered to act through the estrogen receptor, some observations suggest that estrogen target tissues may also contain a binding protein specific for these compounds. The data so far reported, however, are also consistent with ligand-induced changes in conformation or in the state of aggregation of the estrogen receptor. The studies reported here demonstrate the existence of a protein in human myometrial cytosol which binds 1-[4-(2-dimethylaminoethoxy)phenyl]1,2-diphenylbut-1(Z)-ene ([3H]tamoxifen) with high affinity (Kd = 2.3 X 10(-9) M). This protein exhibits striking specificity for nonsteroidal antiestrogens. Estradiol competes weakly for bound [3H]tamoxifen, while other estrogens and nonestrogenic steroid hormones do not compete at all. Sedimentation analysis and molecular sieve chromatography indicate that the antiestrogen-binding protein is a larger species than the estrogen receptor and elutes from DEAE-Sephacel at a lower KCl concentration (0.03 M) than the estrogen receptor (0.15 M). Differential thermal stability of the estrogen receptor and the antiestrogen-binding protein was demonstrable in the absence of added ligand. The antiestrogen-binding protein was ubiquitous, being present in many tissues where estrogen receptor was undetectable. These findings support the separate existence of an antiestrogen-binding protein."

J., Klausner, R. D., and Blumenthal, R. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 8533-8540). In this report we show by gel chromatography and sedimentation analysis that the interaction of clathrin coat protein with unilamellar dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles at pH = 6.0 results in the formation of larger structures. As shown by electron microscopy and an increase in trapped volume of both sucrose and inulin those larger structures represent fused bilayers. We examined the mixing of membrane lipid as a result of membrane fusion using resonance energy transfer between two fluorescent lipid probes incorporated into the same vesicle membrane. At a protein:lipid ratio of 1:500 there was 50% vesicle-vesicle fusion, at pH 6.0, as indicated by the change in efficiency of energy transfer between the fluorescent probes. Fusion was completed within 60 s. A number of other proteins (ovalbumin, rabbit IgG, trypsin, pronase, calmodulin, tubulin, synexin, bovine serum albumin) at 10-fold or higher concentrations, did not induce fusion of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles, either at pH 7.4 or at pH 6.0. This system provides a model for pH-dependent and protein-mediated fusion of uncharged lipid bilayers."

https://openalex.org/W1495408300,"The static accessibility modified discrete charge model for electrostatic interactions in proteins is extended to the prediction of the pH dependence of hydrogen exchange reactions. The exchange rate profiles of buried amide protons are shown to follow the calculated pH dependence of the electrostatic component of protein stability. Rate profiles are calculated for individual buried amide protons in ribonuclease S and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. The electrostatic free energy of stabilization of the protein and the energy required to bring the catalytic ion to an exchange site are expressed as an apparent, pH-dependent contribution to the activation energy. Changes in the electrostatic stabilization of the proteins affect the calculated exchange rate for buried amide protons by more than 1000, while local field effects raise or lower the predicted exchange rates by less than 100. The pH dependence of exchangeable protons at the protein surface, such as the C-2 imidazole protons, is shown to follow the estimated energy required to introduce the catalytic ion at the exchange site. These calculations are discussed in terms of current models for proton exchange which incorporate the dynamic nature of the structure to explain exchange data from the interior of a protein."
https://openalex.org/W1921082721,"The amino acid sequences near the glycosylation sites and the oligosaccharide structures have been determined for the lysosomal protease cathepsin D from porcine spleen. Cathepsin D light and heavy chains were separately digested with proteases and the glycopeptides were purified. A single sequence was constructed from the amino acid sequence of the light chain glycopeptides which is: Tyr-Asn-Ser-Gly-Lys-Ser-Ser-Thr-Tyr-Val-Lys-Asn(CH2O)-Gly-Thr-Thr-Phe. A single glycopeptide sequence was also obtained for the heavy chain: Lys-Gly-Ser-Leu-Asp-Tyr-His-Asn(CH2O)-Val-Thr-Arg-Lys-Ala-Tyr. The light chain sequence is homologous with the sequence of porcine pepsin from residues 56 to 71. The heavy chain sequence is homologous with the pepsin sequence from residues 176 to 189. Thus, the 2 oligosaccharide-linked asparagines in cathepsin D correspond to residues 67 and 183 in pepsin and other homologous aspartyl proteases. These positions are located on the surface of the crystal structures of aspartyl proteases. Five oligosaccharides linked to Asn-67 were separated and their structures determined with proton NMR. Four major oligosaccharides are structural variants from the high mannose-type having 3, 5, 6, and 7 mannoses, respectively. A minor structure contained a third GlcNAc. Three oligosaccharide structures were found linked to Asn-183. Two major oligosaccharides are of the high mannose-type each with 5 mannose residues. One of the two contains a fucose linked to a GlcNAc. A third, very minor oligosaccharide contains galactose."

https://openalex.org/W1561921347,"We report that Chinese hamster ovary cells assemble membrane phospholipids from choline-linked lipid present in fetal calf serum. This was examined by testing the ability of various serum preparations to satisfy the choline requirement of the cells. Chinese hamster ovary cells divided in growth medium containing lipoprotein-deficient serum and approximately 8 microM lysolecithin. Identical results were obtained in growth medium supplemented with solvent-extracted (delipidated) serum reconstituted with purified egg lysolecithin and the uptake of lipid was inhibited by the addition of bovine serum albumin. Analysis of the phospholipid composition of cells incubated with 32Pi and egg lysolecithin in place of choline revealed that approximately 30% of the phosphorus moieties of the cellular phospholipids were derived from the added lipid, while in the presence of choline less than 10% arose in this fashion. Choline starvation enhanced the formation of lecithin from [32P]lysolecithin without affecting phospholipid turnover and labeled lecithin was converted to other phospholipids, especially sphingomyelin and phosphatidylserine. Unlike endogenous serum lysolecithin, lipoproteins obtained from human and fetal calf sera failed to satisfy the choline requirement of Chinese hamster ovary cells, even though 95% of the lipoprotein phospholipid was phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. Together, these results demonstrate that animal cells can derive all of the choline required for membrane phospholipid synthesis from serum lysolecithin and that its conversion to lecithin within the cell is regulated by the availability of choline. In contrast, serum lipoproteins do not normally serve as a major source of choline moieties."

Rats were treated with various doses of triamcinolone diacetate, pulse-labeled with radioactive proline for 20 min, and the procollagens were precipitated with procollagen antibodies. The degree of inhibition of procollagen type I and type III synthesis to corticosteroid treatment was the same. This coordinate effect of glucocorticoids on the synthesis of the two procollagens was reversible, dose-dependent, time-dependent, and observed in lung as well as in skin.

Equilibrium dialysis showed that STA (dimer) has two binding sites for a specific sugar per molecule. STA has a high content of sugar, most of which is L-arabinose, and is rich in Hyp and Cys. On interaction with specific sugars, STA induced a UV difference spectrum having positive peaks at 292 and 285 nm characteristic of tryptophyl residues. The association constants with chitin oligosaccharides, determined from the intensities of the difference spectra at various concentrations of sugars, increased with increasing chain length of the sugar. Association constants obtained by frontal affinity chromatography of chitin oligosaccharides with STA-Sepharose were in good agreement with those obtained by difference spectra, whereas the association constants obtained by frontal affinity chromatography of STA with di- and tri-N-acetylchitotriose-Sepharose were much higher, presumably owing to the effect of multivalency of ligands. The CD spectra of STA in the far UV region indicate the presence of 40% of beta- and 60% of unordered form, and no alpha-helix conformation, which supports the structure suggested by the amino acid composition and the high content of sugar."
https://openalex.org/W1530715964,"Human plasma fibronectin, a membrane-associated protein involved in cell-cell adhesion and growth control, binds tightly to phospholipid vesicles of various compositions, as shown by density gradient centrifugation. The binding occurs in the absence of other proteins, sugars, or divalent cations and results in extensive aggregation of the vesicles. Circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that the protein when associated with vesicles adopts a different conformation from that which it adopts in aqueous solution. The vesicle conformation results from a specific interaction and not merely a hydrophobic effect since it also differs substantially from the conformation of the protein in several detergents. Thus, fibronectin is not only capable of binding to lipid vesicles, but the binding induces both a conformational change in the protein and a structural change (aggregation) in the vesicles, which could be related to its role in cell-cell interactions. While these studies do not constitute proof that lipid molecules are the physiological sites of attachment for fibronectin, they do demonstrate that an intermediate receptor need not necessarily be involved to account for the binding properties."

https://openalex.org/W1527285770,"Cell cycle variations in the phosphorylation of chromatin-associated nonhistones were determined. Cells were radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate and chromatin was obtained by mild digestion of nuclei with micrococcal nuclease. The experiments were performed in the presence of a substrate inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase, beta-glycerophosphate. The results show that, while similar molecular weight species of phosphorylated nonhistones are associated with interphase chromatin through the HeLa cell cycle, the incorporation (32P cpm/micrograms of protein) profiles of selected major phosphononhistones show substantial changes. The most prominent peaks of specific radioactivity occur in the DNA synthesis phase (S phase). The phosphorylation states of the proteins of isolated metaphase chromosomes were also determined. Nonhistone proteins of isolated metaphase chromosomes are strikingly dephosphorylated, especially in comparison to histone H1. The phosphorylation of the major phosphononhistone of chromatin, which has a molecular weight of 55,000, was further characterized by techniques that included one-dimensional peptide mapping in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and nonequilibrium pH gradient slab gel electrophoresis. Phosphoproteins are also components of the nuclear scaffold, and cell cycle variations in these proteins were investigated. The primary phosphorylated species has a molecular weight of 119,000. As with chromatin-associated nonhistones, this nuclear scaffold protein shows substantial incorporation of 32P in S phase, and a high level of incorporation also occurs close to mitosis."

The results show that when the 35S RNA is cross-linked in ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) under appropriate conditions, the predominant configuration is a 2.2 kb intron loop which brings opposite splice sites into proximity; that the predominant secondary structural feature in the free RNA is a relatively large hairpin (length = 0.105 kb) in the center of the molecule at or near the 5' splice site; that the intron loop and the central hairpin are different configurations of sequences at or near the 5' splice site; and that the intron loop is stabilized by protein components of RNPs. Based on the structures detected by psoralen photochemical cross-linking, we propose a mechanism for the splicing of the Neurospora mitochondrial precursor rRNA. We propose further that certain features of this mechanism may be relevant to the splicing of other RNAs, including eucaryotic mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1520390982,"The lipophilic anion tetraphenylboron (TPB-) but not the lipophilic cation tetraphenylarsonium (TPA+) inhibited ATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation by isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum. TPB- did not inhibit ATP hydrolysis but did induce Ca2+ release from preloaded vesicles. It did not appear to disrupt lipid bilayers or to act as a Ca2+ ionophore since it had no effect on the Ca2+ content of phospholipid vesicles. TPB- also induced Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum in chemically skinned muscle fibers causing tension development. In contrast to other Ca2+-releasing agents such as caffeine, proton ionophores, or quercetin, the rise to peak tension was slow and tension was sustained, suggesting that Ca2+ release channels, once opened by TPB-, were held open as long as the compound was present in the membrane. Ca2+ uptake was re-established upon removal of TPB- or addition of TPA+. TPB- or TPA+ would probably distribute within the membrane, altering surface charges on both sides of the membrane. The fact that only a negatively charged ion brought about opening of Ca2+ release channels suggests that specific surface charges control Ca2+ release channels in sarcoplasmic reticulum. Although we have not been able to prove that TPB- acts exclusively on physiologically relevant Ca2+ release channels, we have shown that TPB- does not release Ca2+ from proteoliposomes reconstituted with the Ca2+ + Mg2+ ATPase. Thus TPB- does not induce Ca2+ release through channels formed by the ATPase molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1535116282,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor of mammalian skeletal muscle is a multisubunit membrane glycoprotein whose synthesis is regulated by developmental and physiological cues. We report here the identification and characterization of the primary translation product of alpha subunit mRNA. The alpha subunit synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate is approximately 2000 larger in apparent molecular weight than the native alpha subunit polypeptide found in acetylcholine receptor. Evidence from peptide maps and the effect of co-translational incubation with dog pancreas microsomes suggests that the in vitro product differs in two ways from native alpha subunit: 1) it is synthesized with an NH2-terminal signal peptide which is removed in vivo, and 2) the in vitro product is not glycosylated. We have characterized the alpha subunit mRNA activity by using a quantitative the membrane-bound polysome fraction. It is poly(A+) and approximately 2000 nucleotides long. Finally, we have shown that in BC3H-1 cells, alpha subunit mRNA is regulated developmentally. We detected a 10-fold increase in the relative abundance of alpha subunit mRNA in cells which had undergone the transition from log phase growth to differentiated myoblast."

https://openalex.org/W158770118,"A variety of compounds that can arise from the metabolism of progesterone in vivo stimulate the 16 alpha-hydroxylation of progesterone as catalyzed by highly purified, reconstituted preparations of cytochrome P-450 3b obtained from rabbit strain IIIVO/J. In general, reduction of the 20-keto moiety of progesterone or related compounds increases the extent of stimulation. Reduction of the 3-keto group also results in increased stimulatory activity in most cases. The resulting 3 beta-hydroxy derivatives are more active than the corresponding 3 alpha-isomers. In a similar fashion, 5 beta-pregnanes exhibit greater activity than the corresponding 5 alpha-pregnanes. The effect of these allosteric effectors is saturable at relatively low concentrations when compared to other positive effectors of P-450-mediated metabolism. These compounds increase the apparent ratio of Vmax/Km without altering the amount of reductase required for half-maximal activity when reconstituted with the cytochrome. In contrast, many of these compounds do not affect or inhibit the 6 beta-hydroxylation of progesterone catalyzed by a subform of P-450 3b that is expressed in New Zealand White rabbits but not in strain IIIVO/J. Many of the compounds investigated here are metabolites of progesterone and, therefore, may modulate P-450 3b-mediated metabolism during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W1989491923,"Radiolabeled proteins secreted into the medium by rat Sertoli cells in primary culture have been examined for specific interactions with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against serologically detectable H-Y antigen(s). None of the proteins secreted by Sertoli cells reacted specifically with H-Y antibodies, as determined with immunoprecipitation procedures and immunoabsorbent affinity chromatography, followed by SDS gel electrophoresis. Radioactivity profiles of proteins obtained after reaction with H-Y antibodies were similar to those observed after treatment with nonimmune sera or with irrelevant antibodies. We obtained comparable findings with proteins secreted by the mouse cell line TM4, which is of presumptive Sertoli cell origin, and with proteins present in ram rete testis fluid. These and other findings presented do not support the contention that Sertoli cells secrete a protein having the properties of serologically detectable H-Y antigen as previously described."
https://openalex.org/W1482907863,"Synthetic fragments of apo-C-II, specifically labeled on their NH2-terminals with the 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl or DNS) fluorophore, have been prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis. When a complex is formed between bovine milk lipoprotein lipase and N-dansyl-apo-C-II peptides, resonance energy transfer occurs from the tryptophan residues of the enzyme to the dansyl-labeled peptides upon excitation at 280 nm. In the absence of lipid, the association constant increases 10-fold when the length of the DNS peptide is increased from apo-C-II-DNS(64-78) (0.04 X 10(6) M-1) to apo-C-II-DNS(60-78) (0.3 X 10(6) M-1). In the presence of lipid, the association constants are dependent on peptide chain length, and increase from 0.4 X 10(6) M-1 for apo-C-II-DNS(64-78) to 2.2 X 10(7) M-1 for apo-C-II-DNS(43-78). The interactions are specific for lipoprotein lipase, are disrupted by guanidinium chloride, are not affected by 1.0 M NaCl, and are competitive with the corresponding nondansylated peptide. Apolipoproteins C-III and A-I, at 5 to 1 molar ratios, had no effect on the interaction. These findings demonstrate the importance of the COOH-terminal region in the lipoprotein lipase-apo-C-II interaction and show that activation of the enzyme involves a specific protein-protein interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2342862502,"Bovine cardiac troponin-I (TN-I) and troponin-T (TN-T) have been examined in solution using ultracentrifugation, gel filtration, and viscosity. A new method of purifying TN-T, employing hydroxylapatite chromatography in 6 M urea, is reported. Cardiac TN-T (Mr = 36,000) undergoes a reversible, concentration-dependent association in nondenaturing buffers, probably to a tetramer. The Stokes radius (Rs) of aggregated TN-T, determined by sedimentation velocity and gel chromatography on Sephacryl S-300, is 80 A and the reduced viscosity of the subunit ranges from 20 to 25 ml/g at protein concentrations between 0.5 and 2.5 mg/ml. These data suggest that TN-T forms highly asymmetric aggregates in solution. Bovine cardiac TN-I also has a tendency toward self-association, but is essentially monomeric (Mr = 23,000) at protein concentrations below 1 mg/ml. The presence of reducing agent is necessary to avoid intermolecular disulfide bond formation. From gel filtration experiments, the value of Rs is 29 A indicating that TN-I is a moderately asymmetric protein (frictional ratio = 1.5). Similar properties are observed when both sulfhydryl groups of TN-I are modified by carboxamidomethylation."

https://openalex.org/W1526380415,"We have isolated and purified to homogeneity a novel single-stranded DNA-binding protein from the Novikoff hepatoma. This protein is distinguished from other eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins by binding weakly, but cooperatively, to single-stranded DNA, by its ability to partially destabilize a double helix at 37 degrees C, and by its ability to stimulate DNA polymerase beta. The protein exists as a globular monomer of Mr = 48,000 and is capable of binding 45-49 nucleotides. It does not form a complex with the polymerase, but binds the DNA template, allowing an increased rate and extent of DNA synthesis. The enhancement of synthesis is greatest with larger gap-sized templates and with low polymerase concentrations. The mechanism of stimulation is thought to be due largely to placing the template strand into a conformation that facilitates rapid polymerization rather than strand displacement in advance of the polymerase. This protein has been named SSB-48."
