https://openalex.org/W1996642422,"T cells bearing gamma delta antigen receptors constitute minor populations in most peripheral lymphoid tissues but represent the major populations of T cells in certain epithelia, including the epidermis. We show that murine dendritic epidermal cell (dEC) clones express V gamma and V delta gene segments, which are rare in adult T cells but predominate in fetal thymocytes. Analysis of the junctions of the rearranged gamma and delta genes shows a striking homogeneity among the receptors of five dEC clones. Our data support a model in which dECs represent one of perhaps several waves of emigrants from the early fetal thymus, and imply a role for dECs in immune surveillance that is distinct from that of alpha beta- and other gamma delta-bearing T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1561656160,"The environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetra-chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin produces its biological effects by binding to an intracellular protein (the Ah receptor). The dioxin-Ah receptor complex activates cytochrome P1-450 gene transcription by interacting with dioxin-responsive enhancers. Here, we report that the dioxin-Ah receptor complex binds to DNA containing the sequence 5'-TA/TGCGTG-3', which is present in each of three receptor-dependent enhancers. Functional analyses indicate that binding of the liganded Ah receptor to the core sequence fails to generate an active enhancer and that nucleotides flanking the core sequence must contribute to enhancer function and dioxin action."

The spatiotemporal dynamics of intracellular calcium concentration are demonstrated during spontaneous and evoked activity. The results are in agreement with hypotheses of dendritic segregation of calcium conductances suggested by electrophysiological experiments. These in vitro slice fluorescence imaging methods are applicable to a wide range of problems in central nervous system biochemical and electrophysiological functions.
https://openalex.org/W2057582459,"The supercoiling of 2 micron DNA in yeast by a process or processes that generate positively and negatively supercoiled domains was shown by the use of yeast DNA topoisomerase mutants expressing Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I, an enzyme that relaxes negative supercoils specifically. Intracellular 2 micron DNA becomes positively supercoiled in yeast top1 top2 ts strains expressing the E. coli enzyme when neither one of the yeast DNA topoisomerases I and II is functional. Examination of the linking number distributions of plasmids bearing the inducible promoters of GAL1 and GAL10 genes indicates that the generation of supercoiled domains of opposite signs is related to transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1977701495,"Eukaryotic DNA synthesis is thought to occur in multienzyme complexes present at numerous discrete sites throughout the nucleus. We demonstrate here that cellular DNA replication sites identified by bromodeoxyuridine labeling are relocated in cells infected with herpes simplex virus such that they correspond to viral prereplicative structures containing the HSV DNA replication protein, ICP8. Thus components of the cellular DNA replication apparatus are present at viral prereplicative sites. Mutant virus strains expressing defective ICP8 do not alter the pattern of host cell DNA replication sites, indicating that functional ICP8 is required for the redistribution of cellular DNA replication complexes. This demonstrates that a specific protein molecule can play a role in the organization of DNA replication proteins at discrete sites within the cell nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1538731517,"2-Ethyl-1-hydroxy-2,5,5-trimethyl-3-oxazolidine (OXANOH), the one-electron reduction product of the stable nitroxide radical, 2-ethyl-2,5,5-trimethyl-3-oxazolidinoxyl (OXANO), is reportedly oxidized by superoxide, and its oxidation has been proposed as a method for assaying superoxide. We find that superoxide can both reduce OXANO and oxidize OXANOH. The respective rate constants, k1 and k2, were determined using two superoxide-generating systems (xanthine oxidase/xanthine as well as ionizing radiation). OXANOH oxidation and OXANO reduction are both inhibitable by superoxide dismutase, pH-dependent (4.5-9.3), and result in a steady state distribution of [OXANO] and [OXANOH], independent of their initial concentrations, i.e. the OXANO/OXANOH couple exhibits a metal-independent superoxide dismutase-like function. Thus it provides a prototype for future development of improved low molecular weight superoxide dismutase mimics which will also function in cellular hydrophobic (aprotic) compartments such as membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1976753808,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [I(1,4,5)P3] is a second messenger generated along with diacylglycerol upon the binding of various physiological agents with their cell surface receptors. I(1,4,5)P3 mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular storage sites through a receptor-coupled mechanism, and the subsequent increased intracellular free calcium ion concentration [( Ca2+]i) activates a multitude of cellular responses. Electropermeabilized neoplastic rat liver epithelial (261B) cells were used to study Ca2+ sequestration, a process that reverses the elevated [Ca2+]i to resting levels and replenishes intracellular Ca2+ pools. Although I (1,4,5)P3-mobilized Ca2+ is readily sequestered into storage pools by the action of Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatases, Ca2+ mobilized by addition of the nonmetabolized inositol trisphosphate isomer I(2,4,5)P3 is not sequestered, suggesting that metabolism is necessary to eliminate the stimulus for Ca2+ release. Several inositol phosphate compounds were examined for their ability to lower the buffer [Ca2+] to determine if a specific I(1,4,5)P3 metabolite might be involved in stimulating Ca2+ sequestration; of these, I(1,3,4,5)P4 alone was found to induce Ca2+ sequestration, demonstrating a physiological role for this inositol trisphosphate metabolite."
https://openalex.org/W1545715398,"We have investigated the biochemical basis for the hypersensitivity to intercalating agents and epipodophyllotoxins of a Chinese hamster cell mutant, ADR-1. More topoisomerase II-induced DNA strand breaks are accumulated by ADR-1 than by parental CHO-K1 cells following exposure to the intercalating agent amsacrine. Levels of induced DNA strand breaks correlate with cell killing. Topoisomerase II activity is elevated in ADR-1 cells as a consequence of an increased cellular level of topoisomerase II protein. We have studied the phenotype of cell hybrids generated by fusing parental and mutant cells. The hybrid ADR-1/CHO-K1 exhibits normal levels of resistance to amsacrine and expresses the lower, parental level of topoisomerase II. These results provide additional evidence that topoisomerase II mediates the cytotoxic action of intercalating agents and epipodophyllotoxins and suggest that the intracellular level of topoisomerase II is an important determinant of cellular sensitivity to these drugs. This has implications for antitumor therapy. ADR-1 cells provide a model system for studying the effects of topoisomerase II overproduction on cell proliferation and chromosome organization."
https://openalex.org/W2061875603,"The gp120 envelope glycoprotein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is expressed on the surface of many HIV-infected cells, binds to the cell surface molecule CD4. Soluble derivatives of recombinant CD4 (rCD4) that bind gp120 with high affinity are attractive vehicles for targeting a cytotoxic reagent to HIV-infected cells. Soluble rCD4 was conjugated to the active subunit of the toxin ricin. This conjugate killed HIV-infected H9 cells but was 1/1000 as toxic to uninfected H9 cells (which do not express gp120) and was not toxic to Daudi cells (which express major histocompatibility class II antigens, the putative natural ligand for cell surface CD4). Specific killing of infected cells can be blocked by rgp120, rCD4, or a monoclonal antibody to the gp120 binding site on CD4."
https://openalex.org/W2128171938,"Electron transfer activities and steady state reduction levels of Fe-S centers of NADH-Q oxidoreductase were measured in mitochondria, submitochondrial particles (ETPH), and complex I after treatment with various reagents. p-Chloromercuribenzenesulfonate destroyed the signal from center N-4 (gx = 1.88) in ETPH but not in mitochondria, showing that N-4 is accessible only from the matrix side of the inner membrane. N-Bromosuccinimide also destroyed the signal from N-4 but without inhibiting rotenone-sensitive electron transfer to quinone, suggesting a branched pathway for electron transfer. Diethylpyrocarbonate caused oxidation of N-3 and N-4 in the steady state without changing N-1, suggesting N-1 is before N-3 and N-4. Difluorodinitrobenzene and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide inhibited oxidation of all Fe-S centers and tetranitromethane inhibited reduction of all Fe-S centers. Titrations of the rate of superoxide (O2-) generation in rotenone-treated submitochondrial particles were similar with the ratio [NADH]/[NAD] and that of 3-acetyl pyridine adenine nucleotide in spite of different midpoint potentials of the two couples. On reaction with inhibitors the inhibition of O2- formation was similar to that of ferricyanide reductase rather than quinone reductase. The rate of O2- formation during ATP-driven reverse electron transfer was 16% of the rate observed with NADH. The presence of NAD increased the rate to 83%. The results suggest that bound, reduced nucleotide, probably E-NAD., is the main source of O2- in NADH dehydrogenase. The effect of ATP on the reduction levels of Fe-S centers in well-coupled ETPH was measured by equilibrating with either NADH/NAD or succinate/fumarate redox couples. With NADH/NAD none of the Fe-S centers showed ATP induced changes, but with succinate/fumarate all centers showed ATP-driven reduction with or without NAD present. The effect on N-2 was smaller than that on N-1, N-3, and N-4. These observations indicate that the major coupling interaction is between N-2 and the low potential centers, N-1, N-3, and N-4. Possible schemes of coupling in this segment are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1565639874,"Transin mRNA encodes a secreted metalloprotease which is transcriptionally induced in Rat-1 cells by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and a number of oncogenes. A role for transin in tumor progression is suggested by its overexpression in malignant and metastatic tumors compared to their benign counterparts. In an effort to elucidate mechanisms by which elevated transin expression may be inhibited, it has been determined that both transforming growth factor type beta 1 (TGF beta 1) and increased levels of intracellular cyclic 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) inhibit EGF and oncogene induction of transin mRNA. The inhibition of transin mRNA occurred at the level of transcription as demonstrated by nuclear run-on assays. EGF binding studies in Rat-1 cells showed no significant effect of cAMP or TGF beta 1 on EGF receptor number or affinity. We have also examined the effects of cAMP and TGF beta 1 on oncogene-induced transin using Rat-1 cells transformed by temperature-sensitive mutants of v-src and K-ras oncogenes. Both inhibitors prevented the induction of transin RNA as well as decreased the levels of transin once elevated at the permissive temperature. Despite the similarities in the actions of TGF beta 1 and cAMP on transin gene expression, TGF beta 1 treatment did not significantly elevate intracellular cAMP levels, thus making it unlikely that cAMP is a second messenger system for TGF beta 1 action. These studies suggest that the inhibitory effects of cAMP and TGF beta 1 occur by distinct pathways at the level of gene regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1534431064,"alpha-Factor, a secreted tridecapeptide pheromone, is required for mating between the a- and alpha-haploid mating types of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. An analogue of alpha-factor, [DHP8,DHP11,Nle12] tridecapeptide (where DHP represents 3,4-dehydro-L-proline and Nle represents norleucine), was catalytically reduced in the presence of 3H gas to produce a radiolabeled pheromone with high specific activity, purity, and biological activity. Association and dissociation kinetics indicated values of 4.9 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 for k1 and 1.1 x 10(-3) s-1 for k-1. Saturation binding studies gave an equilibrium dissociation constant equal to 2.3 x 10(-8) M, which approximated the kinetically derived KD of 2.2 x 10(-8) M. These values compare favorably to the previously determined KD of 6 x 10(-9) M (Jenness, D.D., Burkholder, A.C., and Hartwell, L.H. (1986) Mol. Cell. Biol. 6, 318-320). Scatchard analysis and dissociation in the presence of excess unlabeled ligand indicated interaction with a homogeneous population of noninteracting binding sites (13,000 sites/cell). A number of alpha-factor analogues, previously investigated for their structure-function relationships (Naider, F., and Becker, J.M. (1986) CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 21, 225-249), were used to compete with [3H]alpha-factor binding. Four tridecapeptides having conservative amino acid replacements bound strongly to the receptor. In contrast, [Phe3]alpha-factor and 10 des-Trp1-alpha-factor analogues bound to the receptor 1-3 orders of magnitude less effectively than did alpha-factor itself. The binding constants for all active pheromones correlated with biological activity. However, des-Trp1[Phe3]alpha-factor and des-Trp1-[Ala3]alpha-factor, which were not biologically active, still competed with alpha-factor binding, indicating that these analogues fail to induce a secondary signal necessary for biological response to the pheromone. One analogue, des-Trp1-[Cha3,L-Ala9]alpha-factor (where Cha represents cyclohexylalanine), was not biologically active and did not demonstrate binding to the receptor, whereas des-Trp1-[Cha3,D-Ala9]alpha-factor was active and bound to the receptor. This finding suggests that a type II beta-turn is necessary for binding of alpha-factor to its receptor and for subsequent biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W2079828395,"The relationship between genetic alterations at chromosomal band 11p13 and the WAGR (Wilms' tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and mental retardation) syndrome is not clearly understood. To aid our understanding of this relationship, we have constructed a physical map of this region of the genome using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Fifteen newly identified 11p13-specific probes and four previously reported probes were used to subdivide 11p13 into five intervals defined by overlapping constitutional deletions from several WAGR patients. This new repertoire of DNA probes was used to construct a physical map of this region using the infrequently cutting restriction enzymes Mlul and Notl. This map spans approximately 13 Mb and encompasses deletion and translocation breakpoints associated with genitourinary abnormalities, aniridia, and Wilms' tumor. The map also makes it possible to localize the genes for Wilms' tumor (WT) and aniridia (AN2) to a small number of specific Notl restriction fragments."
https://openalex.org/W1597379915,"The processing of poliovirus precursor polypeptides provides a valuable system in which to study the recognition and interaction of a proteolytic enzyme with its substrates. Processing of the poliovirus polyprotein includes cleavage between 9 of 13 available glutamineglycine (Q-G) pairs by the activity of a virally encoded proteinase, 3C. In this study, we assess the importance of primary, secondary, and tertiary structural determinants in the cleavage at two Q-G pairs in the capsid protein precursor, P1. Employing site-directed mutagenesis of cDNA copies of poliovirus RNA, we have made specific alterations in regions of the P1 capsid precursor and have assayed the effect of these alterations on proteinase cleavage at the two Q-G pairs. We have also introduced additional Q-G pairs into P1 and demonstrated that the proteinase can recognize some of the inserted Q-G pairs as cleavage sites. By correlating the predicted three-dimensional structures and the processing phenotypes of several altered P1 precursors, we are able to rank the importance of determinants required for P1 processing. While a Q-G pair appears to be the primary determinant in proteinase recognition, the tertiary location of a Q-G pair in the precursor either allows or prevents processing at that pair. Our results also suggest that the proper folding of at least two of the three P1 beta-barrel structures is required for efficient proteinase cleavage at Q-G pairs."
https://openalex.org/W1554940257,"Both 1,2-diacyl- and 1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerols are formed during stimulation of human neutrophils (PMN), and both can prime respiratory burst responses for stimulation by the chemotactic peptide, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP); however, mechanisms of priming are unknown. Arachidonic acid (AA) release through phospholipase A2 activation and metabolism by 5-lipoxygenase are important activities of PMN during inflammation and could be involved in the process of primed stimulation. Therefore, we have examined the ability of diacyl- and alkylacylglycerols to act as priming agents for AA release and metabolism in human neutrophils. After prelabeling PMN phospholipids with [3H]AA, priming was tested by incubating human PMN with the diacylglycerol, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG), or its alkylacyl analog, 1-O-delta 9-octadecenyl-2-acetylglycerol (EAG) before stimulating with fMLP. fMLP (1 microM), OAG (20 microM), or EAG (20 microM) individually caused little or no release of labeled AA. However, after priming PMN with the same concentrations of either OAG or EAG, stimulation with 1 microM fMLP caused rapid (peak after 1 min) release of 6-8% of [3H]AA from cellular phospholipids; total release was similar with either diglyceride. Priming cells with OAG also enhanced conversion of released AA to leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) upon subsequent fMLP stimulation, but AA metabolites were not increased in EAG-primed PMN. If fMLP was replaced with the calcium ionophore A23187 (which directly causes release of AA and production of LTB4 and 5-HETE), priming by both diglycerides again enhanced release of [3H]AA, but only OAG priming increased lipoxygenase activity. Indeed, EAG pretreatment markedly reduced LTB4 and 5-HETE production. Thus, both diglycerides prime release of AA from membrane phospholipids but have opposite actions on the subsequent metabolism of AA."
https://openalex.org/W1607322826,"The autophosphorylation of purified Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Ca2+/CaM kinase II) on a threonine-containing phosphopeptide common to both the alpha and beta subunits was previously shown to convert this enzyme into a catalytically active Ca2+-independent species. We now have examined the phosphorylation and activation of Ca2+/CaM kinase II in synaptosomes, a Ca2+-dependent neurosecretory system consisting of isolated nerve terminals. Synaptosomes were prelabeled with 32Pi and the alpha subunit of Ca2+/CaM kinase II was immunoprecipitated. Under basal incubation conditions the alpha subunit was phosphorylated. Depolarization of synaptosomes produced a rapid (2-5 s) Ca2+-dependent increase of about 50% in the state of phosphorylation of the alpha subunit. This was followed by a slower increase in the 32P content of the alpha subunit over the next 5 min of depolarization. The enhanced phosphorylation was characterized by an initial rise (2 s) and subsequent decrease (30 s) in the phosphothreonine content of the alpha subunit. In contrast, the phosphoserine content of the alpha subunit slowly increased during the course of depolarization. Thermolytic two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of the alpha subunit demonstrated that depolarization stimulated the labeling of a phosphopeptide associated with autoactivation. In parallel experiments, unlabeled synaptosomes were depolarized, and lysates of these synaptosomes were assayed for Ca2+/CaM kinase II activity. Depolarization produced a rapid (less than or equal to 2 s) increase in Ca2+-independent Ca2+/CaM kinase II activity. This activity returned to basal levels by 60 s. Thus, depolarization of intact synaptosomes is associated with the transient phosphorylation of Ca2+/CaM kinase II on threonine residues, presumably involving an autophosphorylation mechanism and concomitantly the transient generation of the Ca2+-independent form of Ca2+/CaM kinase II."
https://openalex.org/W1507576786,"The photoaffinity ligand [3H]PK 14105 was utilized to modify covalently peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites in rat adrenal mitochondrial preparations. The photolabeled membrane preparations were then solubilized in 1% digitonin and the detergent-soluble extracts subjected to fractionation by ion-exchange chromatography and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. This scheme resulted in the purification of the putative binding site protein for PK 14105 which we have entitled PKBS. Purified preparations of PKBS exhibited a single band with a Mr of approximately 17,000 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver-staining or autoradiographic detection. Additional criteria examining the purity of PKBS preparations were provided by radioiodination with Bolton-Hunter reagent, amino acid analysis, gas-phase sequencing, and reversed-phase chromatography suggesting that this protein was purified to apparent homogeneity. These results demonstrate that a protein associated with peripheral-type benzodiazepine recognition sites has been isolated thus facilitating more direct studies on the structure of this receptor and on the role of these binding sites in mediating responses elicited by benzodiazepines acting at these sites."

https://openalex.org/W1607610170,"Alveolar type II cells express a high affinity receptor for pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A), and the interaction of SP-A with these cells leads to inhibition of surfactant lipid secretion. We have investigated the binding of native and modified forms of SP-A to isolated rat alveolar type II cells. Native and deglycosylated forms of SP-A readily competed with 125I-SP-A for cell surface binding. Alkylation of SP-A with excess iodoacetamide yielded forms of SP-A that did not inhibit surfactant lipid secretion and did not compete with 125I-SP-A for cell surface binding. Reductive methylation of SP-A with H2CO and NaCNBH3 yielded forms of SP-A with markedly reduced receptor binding activity that also exhibited significantly reduced capacity to inhibit lipid secretion. Modification of SP-A with cyclohexanedione reversibly altered cell surface binding and the activity of SP-A as an inhibitor of lipid secretion. Two monoclonal antibodies that block the function of SP-A as an inhibitor of lipid secretion completely prevented the high affinity binding of SP-A to type II cells. A monoclonal antibody that recognizes epitopes on SP-A but failed to block the inhibition of secretion also failed to completely attenuate high affinity binding to the receptor. Concanavalin A inhibits phospholipid secretion of type II cells by a mechanism that is reversed in the presence of excess alpha-methylmannoside. Concanavalin A did not block the high affinity binding of 125I-SP-A to the receptor. Neither the high affinity binding nor the inhibitor activity of SP-A was prevented by the presence of mannose or alpha-methylmannoside. The SP-A derived from humans with alveolar proteinosis is a potent inhibitor of surfactant lipid secretion but failed to completely displace 125I-SP-A binding from type II cells. From these data we conclude that: 1) cell surface binding activity of rat SP-A is directly related to its capacity to inhibit surfactant lipid secretion; 2) monoclonal antibodies directed against SP-A can be used to map binding domains for the receptor; 3) the lectin activity of SP-A against mannose ligands does not appear to be essential for cell surface binding; 4) concanavalin A does not compete with SP-A for receptor binding; and 5) the human SP-A derived from individuals with alveolar proteinosis exhibits different binding characteristics from rat SP-A."
https://openalex.org/W1485484128,"Phosphorylation of pure fructose-6-phosphate,2-kinase:fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase from bovine heart by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C was investigated. The major enzyme form (subunit Mr of 58,000) was rapidly phosphorylated by both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, incorporating 0.8 and 1.0 mol/mol of subunit, respectively. The rate of phosphorylation of the heart enzyme by cAMP-dependent protein kinase was 10 times faster than that of the rat liver enzyme. The minor enzyme (subunit Mr of 54,000), however, was phosphorylated only by protein kinase C and was phosphorylated much more slowly with a phosphate incorporation of less than 0.1 mol/mol of subunit. Phosphorylation by either cAMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase C activated the enzyme, but each phosphorylation affected different kinetic parameters. Phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase lowered the Km value for fructose 6-phosphate from 87 to 42 microM without affecting the Vmax, whereas the phosphorylation by protein kinase C increased the Vmax value from 55 to 85 milliunits/mg without altering the Km value. The phosphorylated peptides were isolated, and their amino acid sequences were determined. The phosphorylation sites for both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C were located in a single peptide whose sequence was Arg-Arg-Asn-Ser-(P)-Phe-Thr-Pro-Leu-Ser-Ser-Ser-Asn-Thr(P)-Ile-Arg-Arg-Pro. The seryl residue nearest the N terminus was the residue specifically phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, whereas the threonine residue nearest the C terminus was phosphorylated by protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W2157438829,"Expression of Na,K-ATPase catalytic alpha isoform (alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3) and beta subunit genes in rodent muscle was investigated using the murine C2C12 myogenic cell line. RNA blot analyses of myoblasts revealed expression primarily of the alpha 1 mRNA and low levels of alpha 2 mRNA. Fusion of the proliferating myoblasts to form myotubes was accompanied by an approximate 12-fold induction of the alpha 2 mRNA. In contrast, expression of alpha 1 mRNA remained constant throughout myogenesis. The alpha 3 mRNA was not detected in either myoblasts or myotubes. The beta mRNA abundance also increased 2-3-fold during myotube formation. In rodent tissues, low and high affinity cardiac glycoside (e.g. ouabain) receptors have been shown to be associated with the Na,K-ATPase catalytic alpha 1 and alpha 2 isoform subunits, respectively. The existence of these two functional classes of Na,K-ATPase in myoblasts and myotubes correlated with the biphasic ouabain inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity. Confluent myoblasts expressed primarily the alpha 1 isozyme (IC50 = 3.6 X 10(-5) M; 95% of total activity) and lesser amounts of the alpha 2 isozyme (IC50 = 1.1 X 10(-7) M; 5% of total activity). In contrast, the myotubes showed significant levels of the alpha 1 isozyme (IC50 = 4.0 X 10(-5) M; 68% of total activity) and, in addition, showed a 6-fold increase in the relative levels of the alpha 2 isozyme (IC50 = 1.1 X 10(-7) M; 32% of total activity). To quantitate further the expression of the high affinity, ouabain-sensitive alpha 2 isozyme, a whole cell [3H]ouabain-binding assay was used. Results revealed that myotubes have an approximately 6-fold greater concentration of [3H]ouabain-binding sites than myoblasts with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.4 X 10(-7) M. The results indicate that muscle cells can express multiple isozymes of Na,K-ATPase and that expression of the alpha 2 isozyme is developmentally regulated during myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1500276470,"Abstract We previously reported the isolation of a full-length cDNA specifying the muscle-specific isozyme of human phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM-M). We now report the isolation of a full-length cDNA specifying the non-muscle-specific, or brain (B), isozyme of human PGAM (PGAM-B). The PGAM-B cDNA encodes a deduced protein 254 amino acids long, 79% identical to PGAM-M, and contains a 913-nucleotide 3'-untranslated region, as compared to the unusually short 37-nucleotide 3'-untranslated region of PGAM-M. Northern analysis demonstrates the non-muscle-specific nature of PGAM-B transcription, while genomic Southern analysis implies the presence of a large PGAM family in the human genome. Most of the PGAM-hybridizing sequences in both the human and mouse genomes seem to be related to the B-isozyme gene; many members of the PGAM-B gene family in humans are apparently processed genes. These results agree with the evolutionary analysis, which indicates that the PGAM-B gene is the progenitor of the PGAM-M gene."
https://openalex.org/W1587587593,"The brain contains two molecular forms of Na,K-ATPase designated alpha found in non-neuronal cells and neuronal soma and alpha + found in axolemma. Previously we have shown that the abundance of both forms (determined by immunoblots) as well as Na,K-ATPase activity increases 10-fold between 4 days before and 20 days after birth (Schmitt, C. A., and McDonough, A. A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10439-10444). Hypothyroidism in neonates blunts these increases. Neonatal, but not adult brain Na,K-ATPase is thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, T3) responsive. This study defines the period during which brain Na,K-ATPase responds to T3. The start of the critical period was defined by comparing Na,K-ATPase activity and alpha and alpha + abundance in hypothyroid and euthyroid neonates (birth to 30 days of age). For all parameters, euthyroid was significantly higher by 15 days of age. The end of the critical period was defined by dosing hypothyroid neonates with T3 daily (0.1 micrograms/g body weight) beginning at increasing days of age, and sacrificing all at 30 days then assaying enzyme activity and abundance. Those starting T3 treatment on or before day 19 were restored to euthyroid levels of Na,K-ATPase activity and abundance, while those starting T3 treatment on or after day 22 remained at hypothyroid levels of enzyme activity and abundance. We conclude that brain Na,K-ATPase alpha and alpha + isoforms are sensitive to T3 by as late as 15 days of age and that the period of thyroid hormone responsiveness is over by 22 days."
https://openalex.org/W2060669483,"As a way of studying nucleosome assembly and maintenance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutants bearing deletions or duplications of the genes encoding histones H2A and H2B were analyzed. Previous genetic analysis had shown that only one of these mutants exhibited dramatic and pleiotropic phenotypes. This mutant was also the only one that contained disrupted chromatin, suggesting that the original phenotypes were attributable to alterations in chromosome structure. The chromatin disruption in the mutant, however, did not extend over the entire genome, but rather was localized to specific regions. Thus, while the arrangement of nucleosomes over the HIS4 and GAL1 genes, the telomeres, and the long terminal repeats (delta sequences) of Ty retrotransposons appeared essentially normal, nucleosomes over the CYH2 and UBI4 genes and the centromere of chromosome III were dramatically disrupted. The observation that the mutant exhibited localized chromatin disruptions implies that the assembly or maintenance of nucleosomes differs over different parts of the yeast genome."
https://openalex.org/W1526869479,"A soluble phospholipase C from rat liver was purified to homogeneity using phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) as substrate. After ammonium sulfate fractionation, the purification involved chromatography on phosphocellulose, DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, hydroxylapatite, Reactive Blue 2 dye-linked agarose, and Mono S cation exchanger. Under the conditions of the assay, the pure enzyme had a specific activity of 407 mumol/mg protein/min. It migrated as a single band with a molecular mass of 87 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The water-soluble product formed during the hydrolysis of PIP2 by the purified enzyme was inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The enzyme shows one-half of maximum velocity at 2 microM Ca2+ with PIP2 as substrate. Between 0 and 100 microM Ca2+, the enzyme shows approximately the same activity with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) as it does with PIP2, and very low activity with phosphatidylinositol. The enzyme is activated by low concentrations of basic proteins; for example, with PIP2 as substrate, 1 microgram/ml histone activates the enzyme 3.6-fold. The enzyme shows an almost absolute requirement for monovalent salts which can be met by different alkali metal halides. A second, minor peak of PIP2-hydrolyzing phospholipase C activity was resolved during chromatography of the enzyme on hydroxylapatite. The substrate specificity suggests that PIP and PIP2 are normal substrates of this enzyme. Under physiological conditions of activation, the enzyme may therefore generate inositol 1,4-bisphosphate and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in amounts determined by the ratio of PIP and PIP2 present in the cellular membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1502982513,"The present study examined the possible role of increased phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) breakdown in the regulation of actin assembly in human neutrophils. Tetracaine, a local anesthetic, was used since it has recently been proposed to inhibit the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate to form PtdIns(4,5)P2. Surprisingly, it was found that incubation with tetracaine alone increased the breakdown of PtdIns(4,5)P2, measured as total inositol trisphosphate formation. This occurred without any rise above basal in the cellular content of filamentous actin. However, in the presence of formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe), tetracaine potentiated the chemotactic-induced increase of both inositol trisphosphate formation and actin polymerization. To further explore the relationship between increased PtdIns(4,5)P2 breakdown and actin polymerization, the activity of phospholipase C was depressed by lowering the cytosolic free calcium ion level or by incubating the cells with ionomycin. In these cells, fMet-Leu-Phe stimulation still raised the cellular content of filamentous actin to a level similar to levels in nontreated cells, despite the absence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis. Consequently, increased breakdown of PtdIns(4,5)P2 alone is not enough to initiate actin polymerization, nor is the polymerization of actin dependent on an increased PtdIns(4,5)P2 breakdown. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that increased turnover of phosphoinositides might act as a modulator of actin assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1588419581,"Dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels exist in many different types of cells and are believed to be regulated by various protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions. The present study concerns the phosphorylation of a putative component of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels by the calcium and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C. A skeletal muscle peptide of 165 kDa, which is known to contain receptors for dihydropyridines, phenylalkylamines, and other Ca2+ channel effectors, was found to be an efficient substrate for protein kinase C when the peptide was phosphorylated in its membrane-bound state. Protein kinase C incorporated 1.5-2.0 mol of phosphate/mol of peptide within 2 min into the 165-kDa peptide in incubations carried out at 37 degrees C. In contrast to the membrane-bound peptide, the purified 165-kDa peptide in detergent solution was phosphorylated to a markedly less extent than its membrane-bound counterpart; less than 0.1 mol of phosphate/mol of peptide was incorporated. Preincubation of the membranes with several types of drugs known to be Ca2+ channel activators or inhibitors had no specific effects on the rate and/or extent of phosphorylation of the 165-kDa peptide by protein kinase C. The phosphorylation of the membrane-bound 165-kDa peptide by protein kinase C was compared to that catalyzed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and was found to be not additive. Prior phosphorylation of the 165-kDa peptide by cAMP-dependent protein kinase prevented subsequent phosphorylation of the peptide by protein kinase C. Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that protein kinase C phosphorylated the 165-kDa peptide at both serine and threonine residues. Phosphopeptide mapping experiments showed that protein kinase C phosphorylated one unique site in the 165-kDa peptide, and, in addition, other sites that were phosphorylated by either cAMP-dependent protein kinase or a multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. The results suggest that the 165-kDa dihydropyridine/phenylalkylamine receptor could serve as a physiological substrate of protein kinase C in intact cells. It is therefore possible that the regulation of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels by activators of protein kinase C may occur at the level of this peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1581546394,"Cyclic nucleotide binding and activation properties of cAMP-dependent protein kinases from five independent mutants of S49 mouse lymphoma cells were studied. These mutants were all hemizygous for expression of mutant regulatory (R) subunits of the type I kinase with lesions that altered the electrostatic charge of R subunit: lesions in three of the mutants mapped to cAMP-binding site A, and those in two of the mutants mapped to cAMP-binding site B. A nucleotide mismatch assay using 32P-labeled cRNA and ribonuclease A confirmed and refined localization of the mutations to single amino acid residues implicated in cAMP binding. R subunits from all mutants retained the ability to bind cAMP, but binding behaved as if it were entirely to nonmutated sites: 1) relative affinities of 11 adenine-modified derivatives of cAMP for mutant enzymes were identical to their relative affinities for the site of wild-type kinase that corresponded to the nonmutated site of the mutant; 2) the potencies of these analogs as activators of mutant kinases were strictly correlated with their binding affinities (for wild-type enzyme activation potencies were correlated with mean affinities of the analogs for cAMP-binding sites A and B); 3) combinations of analogs with strong preferences for opposite cAMP-binding sites in wild-type kinase showed no synergism in activating mutant kinases; 4) dissociation of cAMP from mutant kinases was monophasic; and 5) high salt accelerated dissociation of cAMP from kinases with site B lesions but retarded dissociation from those with site A lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1601058293,"The codon for Ser-46 of the ptsH gene of Bacillus subtilis was modified by site-directed mutagenesis to the codons for Ala, Thr, Tyr, and Asp. The mutant genes were overexpressed, three of the corresponding proteins were purified to homogeneity with the exception for the Asp derivative, which could not be detected, although the gene had the desired nucleotide sequence. The phosphotransferase activity of the altered proteins was determined to be 20-35% of wild type activity, which correlates well with the slow phosphorylation of heat-stable protein (HPr) by enzyme I and phosphoenolpyruvate. The ATP-dependent HPr kinase, which previously was shown to be involved in the regulation of carbohydrate uptake of Gram-positive bacteria by covalent phosphorylation of Ser-46 of HPr, is entirely inactive toward the OH group of Thr-46 and Tyr-46 proteins. In addition, we constructed a strain of B. subtilis, where the altered gene coding for the Ala-46 derivative of HPr was introduced into the bacterial chromosome. The physiological properties of this mutant are described."
https://openalex.org/W1570777334,"A membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase was purified from rat brain. The enzyme was solubilized with Triton X-100 from salt-washed membrane and purified 11,183-fold, with a final specific activity of 150 nmol/min/mg of protein. Purification steps included several chromatography using Q-Sepharose Fast Flow, cellulose phosphate, Toyopearl HW 55 and Affi-Gel Blue. The purified PI kinase had an estimated molecular weight of 80,000 by gel filtration and 76,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified kinase phosphorylated only PI and did not phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate or diacylglycerol. Km values for PI and ATP were found to be 115 and 150 microM, respectively. The enzyme required Mg2+ (5-20 mM) or Mn2+ (1-2 mM) for activity, was stimulated by 0.1-1.0% (w/v) Triton X-100, and completely inhibited by 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The enzyme activity showed a broad pH optimum at around 7.4. The enzyme utilized ATP and not GTP as phosphate donor. Nucleoside triphosphates other than ATP and diphosphates significantly inhibited the kinase activity. However, inhibitory effects of adenosine, cAMP, and quercetin were weak."
https://openalex.org/W1598801033,"The superoxide-generating respiratory burst oxidase is an integral membrane enzyme found in the plasma membrane of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils). NADPH-dependent superoxide generation is seen in isolated plasma membranes and in their detergent extracts following activation of the intact cells with phorbol myristate acetate. We have herein examined the effects of phospholipids on the activity of the solubilized oxidase. Solubilization of plasma membranes with 0.5% each of Tween 20 plus deoxycholate resulted in an approximately 2-fold enhancement of activity. Inclusion of phospholipids in the extraction medium resulted in further activation. At 1.0 mg/ml the order of effectiveness was phosphatidylserine (PS) greater than cardiolipin greater than phosphatidylethanolamine greater than phosphatidylinositol; phosphatidylcholine and phosphorylated inositol lipids were not effective. The concentrations required for half-maximal activation by PS and phosphatidylethanolamine were 85 and 200 micrograms/ml, respectively. When PS was used at a maximally activating concentration (0.5 mg/ml), the activity was enhanced 3-5-fold. Detergent solubilization alone elevated the Km of the oxidase for NADPH from 68 microM in intact plasma membranes to 123 microM, but inclusion of PS with detergent restored the Km to near or below that seen in intact membranes. PS also increased the Vmax by a factor of 2-3, but had no effect on the pH optimum. A plot of the activity versus enzyme concentration was linear when membranes were used, but activity showed a quadratic dependence on concentration in solubilized membrane, with lower than expected activity at lower enzyme concentration. PS restored linearity of the concentration-activity plot. The activation by PS was not influenced by the addition of Ca2+, EGTA, or dioctanoylglycerol, indicating that activation was not dependent on protein kinase C. These results implicate phosphatidylserine as a direct effector of the NADPH-oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1579169096,"The non-ionic detergent n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside was used to solubilize the VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) receptor from human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line HT29-D4. The binding of monoiodinated 125I-VIP to the solubilized receptor was specific, time-dependent, and reversible. Scatchard analysis of data obtained from competitive displacement of monoiodinated 125I-VIP by native VIP suggested the presence of two classes of VIP binding sites with Kd values of 0.32 and 46.7 nM. The binding capacities of these two classes were 1.7 x 10(10) and 30.2 x 10(10) sites/mg of proteins, respectively. The solubilized receptor retained the specificity of the human VIP receptor towards the peptides of the VIP/secretin/glucagon family. The order of potency in inhibiting monoiodinated 125I-VIP binding was VIP (IC50 = 1.0 x 10(-9) M) much greater than peptide histidine methionine amide (IC50 = 10(-7) M) greater than growth hormone-releasing factor (IC50 = 3 x 10(-7) M) greater than secretin (IC50 greater than 10(-6) M); glucagon had no effect on VIP binding. The reducing agent dithiothreitol inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the binding of 125I-VIP. Covalent cross-linking experiments between the solubilized receptor and 125I-VIP showed that after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography two major and one minor polypeptides of Mr 67,000, 72,000, and 83,000 were specifically labeled. When analyzed by gel filtration, the n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside-solubilized 125I-VIP-receptor complex was resolved into two major peaks with molecular mass in the range of 60-70 and 270-300 kDa. Thus, the soluble form of the VIP receptor was probably a multimeric complex in which disulfide bonds may play an important role to hold the receptor in an active configuration."
https://openalex.org/W1497668593,"The mouse cytotoxic T cell clone (CTLL-2) was able to grow in the presence of culture medium supplemented only with transferrin, 2-mercaptoethanol, and recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2). This lymphokine stimulated the synthesis of DNA in these cells. Similarly, phorbol esters, which activate protein kinase C, induced DNA synthesis in this clone. Furthermore, this later proliferation was not blocked by anti-IL-2 receptor antibodies, which inhibited IL-2-induced proliferation, suggesting that it was not indirectly due to the secretion of IL-2 by the cells. CTLL-2 cells pretreated with high doses of phorbol esters for 48 h down regulated protein kinase C and were depleted of this enzyme. This was shown by: 1) purification and in vitro assay of protein kinase C; 2) the lack of effect of phorbol esters in the stimulation of the Na+/H+ anti-porter which has been directly linked to the activation of protein kinase C. As expected, those protein kinase C-depleted cells no longer synthesized DNA and proliferated in response to phorbol esters. However, they proliferated identically to control cells in response to IL-2. Therefore, our results suggest two different pathways for T cell proliferation, one which involves protein kinase C and the other which does not."
https://openalex.org/W1490849127,"Abstract Hepatoma cells were infected with replication-incompetent murine retroviruses containing the selectable gene for amino-3'-glycosyl phosphotransferase (neo) and/or the nonselectable gene for bovine growth hormone (bGH). Expression of these genes was controlled by the promoter regulatory region of the gene for the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) (PEPCK) from the rat, which contains hormone and tissue-specific regulatory elements. Expression of the transduced PEPCK-neo gene was stimulated by Bt2cAMP and glucocorticoids and inhibited by insulin. The amount of RNA which initiated within the retroviral 5' long terminal repeat (5' LTR) was inhibited when internal promoters were present in the retroviral vector. When no internal promoter was present, expression from the 5' LTR was higher and stimulated by glucocorticoids, due to the presence of a glucocorticoid regulatory element in the 5' LTR. Infection of cells with retroviruses altered the basal expression and hormonal regulation of the endogenous PEPCK gene, but had no effect on the expression of the tyrosine aminotransferase gene, which is regulated in a similar manner by cAMP and glucocorticoids. A segment of the PEPCK promoter acted as a hormonally regulated enhancer, bringing the SV40 early promoter under the control of Bt2cAMP. A second, nonselectable gene (PEPCK-bGH), contained in the retroviral vector together with PEPCK-neo, was expressed and regulated appropriately when introduced into hepatoma cells. The proviruses were initially integrated randomly into the host cell genome, but after prolonged selection for expression of the transduced PEPCK-neo gene, cells were selected which contain a predominant site(s) of integration. Among populations of cells, however, the predominant site(s) of proviral integration was different. The selection of cells with a specific site of integration from a population was accelerated by the presence of PEPCK promoter sequences in the provirus. Despite the need to better characterize their effects on the host cell, retroviruses appear to be versatile tools for the specific introduction of regulated genes into cells."
https://openalex.org/W1551698626,"Protein A of soluble methane monooxygenase (EC 1.14.13.25) of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) is the hydroxylase component of the enzyme complex, capable of inserting an atom of oxygen into methane. The protein possesses an unusual non-heme iron center consisting of two mu-hydroxo-bridged antiferromagnetically coupled iron atoms. It was possible to remove the iron center of protein A by subjecting the protein to freeze/thaw cycles or by dialysis against 8-hydroxyquinoline. Incubation of iron-depleted protein A with iron-EDTA and dithiothreitol resulted in the reassembly of the iron center of protein A as judged by restoration of enzyme activity (typically approximately 3 times the original activity) and by ESR spectroscopic methods. Reconstitution was inhibited by a number of metal ions, but none of the metals tested proved capable of replacing iron in the oxidation of methane. A number of iron-chelating agents exhibited weak inhibition of reconstitution. The KM(app) for iron in the reconstitution reaction was 133 microM. In vitro translation of total RNA isolated from M. capsulatus (Bath) produced protein A subunits equal to the native molecular weight, suggesting that there is no precursor form of this protein. Addition of the in vitro translated protein A to the reconstitution system resulted in low levels of hydroxylase activity suggesting that the subunits of protein A are self-assembling, a supposition supported by the presence of only one protein band on nondenaturing gels. Taken together, these data suggest that the subunits of protein A are synthesized in their native, mature form and self-assemble into an apoprotein A, into which the iron center is inserted."
https://openalex.org/W1597347332,"Rat hepatocytes treated with 1,4-benzoquinone formed 1,4-benzosemiquinone and 2-S-glutathionyl-1,4-benzosemiquinone radicals as detected by ESR spectroscopy. The 2-S-glutathionyl-1,4-benzosemiquinone radical was first obtained from the reaction of 1,4-benzoquinone with glutathione. Glutathione both reduced benzoquinone to form benzosemiquinone and conjugated benzoquinone to form 2-S-glutathionyl-1,4-benzosemiquinone radical. The ratio of these two radicals depended upon the ratio of 1,4-benzoquinone to glutathione. At near equimolar ratios, the 2-S-glutathionyl-1,4-benzosemiquinone radical was predominantly formed. This radical was characterized by computer simulation of the experimental spectra and identified by comparison of its hyperfine coupling constants with those of chemical analogues. The 2-S-glutathionyl-1,4-benzosemiquinone radicals formed inside hepatocytes, and then crossed the plasma membrane into the media."
https://openalex.org/W1490925016,"Abstract The visual excitation system of the retinal rod outer segments and the hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase complex are regulated through guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, transducin in the former and inhibitory and stimulatory regulatory components, Gi and Gs, in the latter. These proteins are functionally and structurally similar; all are heterotrimers composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits and exhibit guanosine triphosphatase activity stimulated by light-activated rhodopsin or the agonist-receptor complex. Adenylate cyclase can be stimulated by vanadate, which, like NaF, probably acts through Gs. Effects of vanadate on the function of a guanine nucleotide-binding protein were investigated in a reconstituted model system consisting of purified transducin subunits (T alpha, T beta gamma) and rhodopsin in phosphatidylcholine vesicles. Vanadate (decameric) inhibited [3H]GTP binding to T alpha and noncompetitively inhibited GTP hydrolysis in a concentration-dependent manner with maximal inhibition of approximately 90% at 3-5 mM. Vanadate also inhibited release of bound GDP but did not affect the rate of hydrolysis of bound GTP (single turnover rate), indicating that vanadate did not interfere with the intrinsic GTPase activity of T alpha. Binding of T alpha to rhodopsin and the ADP-ribosylation of T alpha by pertussis toxin, both of which are enhanced in the presence of T beta gamma, were inhibited by vanadate. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that vanadate can cause the dissociation of T alpha from T beta gamma, resulting in the inhibition of GDP-GTP exchange and thereby GTP hydrolysis. Adenylate cyclase activation could result from a similar effect of vanadate on Gs."

We now report the sequence of the whole protein and the identification of its N-terminal blocking group. The protein tryptic peptides of phosphoglycerate mutase isozyme B were isolated by high performance liquid chromatography and their sequence determined by microsequencing. The sequence and the nature of the blocking group of the N-terminal tryptic peptide was shown to be N-acetyl-Ala-Ala-Tyr-Lys by mass spectrometry. Overlaps of the tryptic peptides were obtained by studying the V8 Staphylococcus aureus protease peptides of the aminoethylated phosphoglycerate mutase isozyme B either by microsequencing or by mass spectrometry. The procedure used allowed us to obtain the sequence on a very small amount of material and in a short period of time. Our data agree well with those derived from the cDNA nucleotide sequence described by Sakoda et al. (Sakoda, S., Shanske, S., DiMauro, S., and Schon, E. A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 16899-16905). In addition, our data directly indicate that the initiation codon does not introduce a methionine as N-terminal amino acid and allowed the identification of the acetyl N-terminal group."

The predominant acceptor for this transfer in rat liver is a glycoprotein of 62 kDa. This acceptor was labeled in liver homogenates through incubation with the 35S-labeled phosphorothioate analogue of UDP-Glc, and its distribution following differential centrifugation was compared to that of the glycoproteins labeled by CMP-[3H]N-acetylneuraminic acid. Whereas 94% of the 3H-labeled macromolecules fractionated to the microsomal pellet, 85% of the 35S-labeled 62-kDa glycoprotein was found in the high-speed supernatant. The distribution of the Glc-phosphotransferase was also examined following differential centrifugation, and the bulk of the activity was found in the 100,000 x g pellet. In contrast to results obtained with the lumenal microsomal markers 4 beta-galactosyltransferase and mannose-6-phosphatase, however, optimal activity of the Glc-phosphotransferase was not dependent on the disruption of microsomal vesicles by detergent. In addition, Glc-phosphotransferase was degraded by exogenous proteases in the absence of detergent, whereas the lumenal markers were not. We conclude, therefore, that the 62-kDa acceptor glycoprotein is cytoplasmic and is glycosylated by the Glc-phosphotransferase at a site accessible to the cytoplasm. This may prove to be a model for the topography of glycosylation of other cytoplasmic glycoproteins as well."

In an attempt to establish a cell line in which it would be possible to regulate proline-rich protein gene transcription, rat parotid gland cells were fused with the rat hepatoma cell line, FTO-2B. Fused cells were obtained that had a frequency of 7.5 x 10(-6), which is about 125-fold greater than the reversion rate of FTO-2B. The hybrid cells exhibited induced proline-rich protein mRNA synthesis when incubated with either dibutyryl cyclic AMP or forskolin. The ability to induce these genes was maintained for at least 20 passages. Most of the fused cell populations also synthesized elevated levels of alpha-amylase mRNA, another tissue-specific gene."
https://openalex.org/W1486716346,"Methylation of nucleic acid bases is known to prevent the cleavage of DNA by restriction endonucleases. The effect on the conformation of the DNA molecule itself and hence its interactions with other DNA binding proteins has been a subject of general interest. To help address this question, we have solved the crystal structure at 2.0 A of the methylated dodecamer, d(CGCGAm6ATTCGCG), which contains the EcoRI recognition sequence and have compared the conformation of the methylated molecule with that of its nonmethylated counterpart. This methylation produces a bulky hydrophobic patch on the floor of the major groove of B-DNA which plays an important role in the mechanism of inhibition of EcoRI restriction activity. However, with the exception of small perturbations in the immediate vicinity of the methyl groups, the structure is virtually unchanged. Given the lack of a conformational change upon methylation, we have extended this thesis of the recognition process to other types of restriction systems and found that different restriction enzymes seem to have their own characteristic protein-DNA interactions. The relative spatial orientations of methylation sites and cleavage sites must play a major role in ordering protein secondary structure elements as well as subunit-subunit interactions along the DNA strand."
https://openalex.org/W1539406240,"Time-resolved phosphorescence anisotropy has been used to assess the rotational dynamics of human serum lipoproteins labeled with phosphorescent probes of high triplet yield. Labeling the lipid phase of low density, very low density, and high density lipoproteins with an eosinyl fatty acid revealed the existence of two motions. The shorter time constant was attributed to motion of the chromophore within the lipoprotein particle, while the longer time constant represented the global tumbling of the particles in solution. The measured correlation times for this global motion were about twice those predicted from the Stokes-Einstein relationship. Covalent labeling of the apolipoproteins of the low and high density lipoproteins with erythrosin revealed the existence of segmental motion of labeled domains of the apolipoprotein within their respective particles. The correlation times for this motion were within the range 10-50 microseconds. The binding of low density lipoproteins to receptors on membranes isolated from the adrenal cortex resulted in a freezing of the global motion, but maintenance of the faster segmental motion of the labeled domains of the apolipoprotein. The experiments imply that in these membranes there is no global motion of the low density lipoprotein-receptor complex on the phosphorescence time scale. Similar results were found for the binding of high density lipoproteins to liver plasma membranes. The contributions of nonspecific binding of the labeled lipoproteins to the measured phosphorescence anisotropy were carefully assessed."
https://openalex.org/W1531633189,"When assayed for specific opiate binding in the presence of 120 mM NaCl, digitonin extracts from frog (Rana ridibunda) brain membranes were found to contain about the same quantity (0.5 pmol/mg of protein) of high (Kdh = 0.4 nM) and of lower (Kdl = 15-20 nM) affinity sites for the opiate agonist [3H]etorphine. The two classes of [3H]etorphine binding sites displayed equally high (Kd = 0.3 nM) affinity for the opiate antagonist [3H]diprenorphine. 5'-Guanylylimidodiphosphate (GppNHp) selectively and potently (IC50 = 0.1 microM) inhibited high affinity binding of the tritiated agonist, and this inhibition resulted from the GppNHp-induced conversion of the high into the lower affinity sites for [3H]etorphine. Following centrifugation of the digitonin extract in sucrose gradients, opioid binding activity was found to be associated with two clearly separated macromolecular components of apparent sedimentation coefficients 11.5 and 9.7 S, respectively. The two components bound [3H]diprenorphine equally well, whereas the fast sedimented component bound [3H]etorphine better than did the slower sedimented one. In addition, labeling of the component of bigger apparent size with [3H]etorphine was considerably reduced in the presence of 50 microM GppNHp. Finally, in soluble extracts which had been (i) preincubated with and (ii) centrifuged in the presence of GppNHp, the fast sedimented component was no longer observed while there was about twice as much of the component of smaller apparent size as in control (no GppNHp) extracts. Together, these results demonstrated the existence of an opioid receptor-G protein complex which, in digitonin solution, was still amenable to regulation (dissociation) by guanine nucleotides."
