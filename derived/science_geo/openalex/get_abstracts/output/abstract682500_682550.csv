https://openalex.org/W3206181818,"The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines against new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections requires continuous re-evaluation, given the increasingly dominant B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of these vaccines in a large, community-based survey of randomly selected households across the United Kingdom. We found that the effectiveness of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 against infections (new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases) with symptoms or high viral burden is reduced with the B.1.617.2 variant (absolute difference of 10-13% for BNT162b2 and 16% for ChAdOx1) compared to the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant. The effectiveness of two doses remains at least as great as protection afforded by prior natural infection. The dynamics of immunity after second doses differed significantly between BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, with greater initial effectiveness against new PCR-positive cases but faster declines in protection against high viral burden and symptomatic infection with BNT162b2. There was no evidence that effectiveness varied by dosing interval, but protection was higher in vaccinated individuals after a prior infection and in younger adults. With B.1.617.2, infections occurring after two vaccinations had similar peak viral burden as those in unvaccinated individuals. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination still reduces new infections, but effectiveness and attenuation of peak viral burden are reduced with B.1.617.2."

https://openalex.org/W3206568807,"Current methods to delete genomic sequences are based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–Cas9 and pairs of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), but can be inefficient and imprecise, with errors including small indels as well as unintended large deletions and more complex rearrangements. In the present study, we describe a prime editing-based method, PRIME-Del, which induces a deletion using a pair of prime editing sgRNAs (pegRNAs) that target opposite DNA strands, programming not only the sites that are nicked but also the outcome of the repair. PRIME-Del achieves markedly higher precision than CRISPR–Cas9 and sgRNA pairs in programming deletions up to 10 kb, with 1–30% editing efficiency. PRIME-Del can also be used to couple genomic deletions with short insertions, enabling deletions with junctions that do not fall at protospacer-adjacent motif sites. Finally, extended expression of prime editing components can substantially enhance efficiency without compromising precision. We anticipate that PRIME-Del will be broadly useful for precise, flexible programming of genomic deletions, epitope tagging and, potentially, programming genomic rearrangements. Paired prime editing is used to precisely delete genomic sequences up to 10 kb."

https://openalex.org/W3206878019,"Abstract Untargeted metabolomics experiments rely on spectral libraries for structure annotation, but, typically, only a small fraction of spectra can be matched. Previous in silico methods search in structure databases but cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect annotations. Here we introduce the COSMIC workflow that combines in silico structure database generation and annotation with a confidence score consisting of kernel density P value estimation and a support vector machine with enforced directionality of features. On diverse datasets, COSMIC annotates a substantial number of hits at low false discovery rates and outperforms spectral library search. To demonstrate that COSMIC can annotate structures never reported before, we annotated 12 natural bile acids. The annotation of nine structures was confirmed by manual evaluation and two structures using synthetic standards. In human samples, we annotated and manually validated 315 molecular structures currently absent from the Human Metabolome Database. Application of COSMIC to data from 17,400 metabolomics experiments led to 1,715 high-confidence structural annotations that were absent from spectral libraries."
https://openalex.org/W3207691330,"Genomic insertions, duplications and insertion/deletions (indels), which account for ~14% of human pathogenic mutations, cannot be accurately or efficiently corrected by current gene-editing methods, especially those that involve larger alterations (>100 base pairs (bp)). Here, we optimize prime editing (PE) tools for creating precise genomic deletions and direct the replacement of a genomic fragment ranging from ~1 kilobases (kb) to ~10 kb with a desired sequence (up to 60 bp) in the absence of an exogenous DNA template. By conjugating Cas9 nuclease to reverse transcriptase (PE-Cas9) and combining it with two PE guide RNAs (pegRNAs) targeting complementary DNA strands, we achieve precise and specific deletion and repair of target sequences via using this PE-Cas9-based deletion and repair (PEDAR) method. PEDAR outperformed other genome-editing methods in a reporter system and at endogenous loci, efficiently creating large and precise genomic alterations. In a mouse model of tyrosinemia, PEDAR removed a 1.38-kb pathogenic insertion within the Fah gene and precisely repaired the deletion junction to restore FAH expression in liver. Prime editing is expanded to deletions and replacements of genomic sequences of up to 10 kb."
https://openalex.org/W3206575932,"The evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus leads to new variants that warrant timely epidemiological characterization. Here we use the dense genomic surveillance data generated by the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium to reconstruct the dynamics of 71 different lineages in each of 315 English local authorities between September 2020 and June 2021. This analysis reveals a series of subepidemics that peaked in early autumn 2020, followed by a jump in transmissibility of the B.1.1.7/Alpha lineage. The Alpha variant grew when other lineages declined during the second national lockdown and regionally tiered restrictions between November and December 2020. A third more stringent national lockdown suppressed the Alpha variant and eliminated nearly all other lineages in early 2021. Yet a series of variants (most of which contained the spike E484K mutation) defied these trends and persisted at moderately increasing proportions. However, by accounting for sustained introductions, we found that the transmissibility of these variants is unlikely to have exceeded the transmissibility of the Alpha variant. Finally, B.1.617.2/Delta was repeatedly introduced in England and grew rapidly in early summer 2021, constituting approximately 98% of sampled SARS-CoV-2 genomes on 26 June 2021."
https://openalex.org/W3205125006,"Transcription factors bind DNA sequence motif vocabularies in cis-regulatory elements (CREs) to modulate chromatin state and gene expression during cell state transitions. A quantitative understanding of how motif lexicons influence dynamic regulatory activity has been elusive due to the combinatorial nature of the cis-regulatory code. To address this, we undertook multiomic data profiling of chromatin and expression dynamics across epidermal differentiation to identify 40,103 dynamic CREs associated with 3,609 dynamically expressed genes, then applied an interpretable deep-learning framework to model the cis-regulatory logic of chromatin accessibility. This analysis framework identified cooperative DNA sequence rules in dynamic CREs regulating synchronous gene modules with diverse roles in skin differentiation. Massively parallel reporter assay analysis validated temporal dynamics and cooperative cis-regulatory logic. Variants linked to human polygenic skin disease were enriched in these time-dependent combinatorial motif rules. This integrative approach shows the combinatorial cis-regulatory lexicon of epidermal differentiation and represents a general framework for deciphering the organizational principles of the cis-regulatory code of dynamic gene regulation. A deep-learning framework interprets multiomic data across epidermal differentiation, identifying cooperative DNA sequence rules that regulate gene modules. Massively parallel reporter assay analysis validates temporal dynamics and cis-regulatory logic."
https://openalex.org/W3205374655,"The axon initial segment of hippocampal pyramidal cells is a key subcellular compartment for action potential generation, under GABAergic control by the “chandelier” or axo-axonic cells (AACs). Although AACs are the only cellular source of GABA targeting the initial segment, their in vivo activity patterns and influence over pyramidal cell dynamics are not well understood. We achieved cell-type-specific genetic access to AACs in mice and show that AACs in the hippocampal area CA1 are synchronously activated by episodes of locomotion or whisking during rest. Bidirectional intervention experiments in head-restrained mice performing a random foraging task revealed that AACs inhibit CA1 pyramidal cells, indicating that the effect of GABA on the initial segments in the hippocampus is inhibitory in vivo. Finally, optogenetic inhibition of AACs at specific track locations induced remapping of pyramidal cell place fields. These results demonstrate brain-state-specific dynamics of a critical inhibitory controller of cortical circuits."
https://openalex.org/W3205102356,"The Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) is a transmembrane protein with important roles in cellular homeostasis in normal physiology and in disease. Especially in neurodegenerative diseases, S1R activation has been shown to provide neuroprotection by modulating calcium signaling, mitochondrial function and reducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. S1R missense mutations are one of the causes of the neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and distal hereditary motor neuronopathies. Although the S1R has been studied intensively, basic aspects remain controversial, such as S1R topology and whether it reaches the plasma membrane. To address these questions, we have undertaken several approaches. C-terminal tagging with a small biotin-acceptor peptide and BirA biotinylation in cells suggested a type II membrane orientation (cytosolic N-terminus). However, N-terminal tagging gave an equal probability for both possible orientations. This might explain conflicting reports in the literature, as tags may affect the protein topology. Therefore, we studied untagged S1R using a protease protection assay and a glycosylation mapping approach, introducing N-glycosylation sites. Both methods provided unambiguous results showing that the S1R is a type II membrane protein with a short cytosolic N-terminal tail. Assessments of glycan processing, surface fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and cell surface biotinylation indicated ER retention, with insignificant exit to the plasma membrane, in the absence or presence of S1R agonists or of ER stress.

The Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) is a small transmembrane protein (25 KDa), which is localized predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), preferentially at the mitochondrion-associated membranes (MAM) (1Fujimoto M.

The S1R is expressed in many tissues and has important roles in modulating calcium signaling and mitochondrial function, with special importance in the central nervous system. Decreased levels of S1R or of its activity have been found associated with neurodegenerative diseases (6Al-Saif A. Al-Mohanna F. Bohlega S.

However, the basic topology of this protein remains controversial. Initial studies suggested the existence of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) (4Hayashi T. Su T.P. Sigma-1 receptor chaperones at the ER-mitochondrion interface regulate Ca(2+) signaling and cell survival.Cell. 2007; 131: 596-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). The determination of the crystal structure of the S1R points to only one TMD near the N-terminus of the protein, but still leaves open the possibility of two possible orientations in the membrane. There is no cleaved signal peptide, but the C-terminal bulk of the protein could be in the lumen of the ER (type II membrane protein) or in the cytosol (type III membrane protein). Another important issue is to what extent the S1R reaches the cell surface. The S1R appears to be mainly localized at an ER subdomain that contacts mitochondria, the MAM (4Hayashi T. Su T.P. Sigma-1 receptor chaperones at the ER-mitochondrion interface regulate Ca(2+) signaling and cell survival.Cell. 2007; 131: 596-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). However, it has also been reported to be present on the plasma membrane (16Alonso G. Phan V. Guillemain I. Saunier M. Legrand A. Anoal M. Maurice T. Immunocytochemical localization of the sigma(1) receptor in the adult rat central nervous system.Neuroscience. 2000; 97: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) where it might be translocated upon activation with agonists (17Morin-Surun M.P.

A. 1999; 96: 8196-8199Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, on closer inspection, the location seems to be not at the plasma membrane but at close subsurface areas (17Morin-Surun M.P. Collin T. Denavit-Saubie M. Baulieu E.E. Monnet F.P. Intracellular sigma1 receptor modulates phospholipase C and protein kinase C activities in the brainstem.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The expression and functional characterization of sigma (sigma) 1 receptors in breast cancer cell lines.Cancer Lett. 2006; 242: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), perhaps at ER domains adjacent to the plasma membrane (19Mavlyutov T.A. Epstein M.L. Andersen K.A. Ziskind-Conhaim L. Ruoho A.E. The sigma-1 receptor is enriched in postsynaptic sites of C-terminals in mouse motoneurons. An anatomical and behavioral study.Neuroscience. 2010; 167: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Given the biological and pharmacological importance of the S1R, a clear understanding of its topology relative to the membrane and of its presence or absence at the cell surface is essential. Prediction algorithms of S1R membrane topology give a wide array of possibilities, whereas the conflicting studies use tags that might affect S1R topology. Here we analyzed S1R topology using different approaches, some of them with untagged S1R. In one such approach, we introduced N-glycosylation sites at key residues and tested their glycosylation. These constructs also allowed us to follow their sugar chain processing as an indicator of ER exit. The crystal structure of the human sigma-1 receptor indicated the existence of only one TMD near the N-terminus of the protein (20Schmidt H.R. Zheng S. Gurpinar E. Koehl A. Manglik A. Kruse A.C. Crystal structure of the human sigma1 receptor.Nature. 2016; 532: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Previous reports had suggested one or two TMDs (4Hayashi T. Su T.P.

Furthermore, analyses of the S1R protein sequence (Fig. 1A) by different topology prediction methods estimate a surprisingly wide range of topologies, with one to three TMDs, and both possible orientations of the N-terminus, toward the ER lumen or toward the cytosol (Fig. S1). If indeed the S1R has a single TMD, given the lack of a signal peptide, it could adopt either a type II orientation (C-terminus in the ER lumen) or a type III orientation (N-terminus in the ER lumen). Moreover, both the prediction published with the 3D structure (20Schmidt H.R. Zheng S. Gurpinar E. Koehl A. Manglik A. Kruse A.C. Crystal structure of the human sigma1 receptor.Nature. 2016; 532: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and the combined prediction of the CCTOP server (24Dobson L. Reményi I. Tusnády G.E. Cctop: A Consensus Constrained TOPology prediction web server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: W408-W412Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1) suggest a type III orientation. To further inspect the S1R orientation, we first used a system that allows in vivo labeling in cells and sensitive detection of protein epitopes in the ER lumen or in the cytosol. This system uses a specific biotinylation reaction by the Escherichia coli-derived biotin-ligase BirA (25Barker D.F. Campbell A.M. The birA gene of Escherichia coli encodes a biotin holoenzyme synthetase.J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 146: 451-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) on a 15 aa long biotin acceptor peptide (BAP), which is linked to the protein of interest. BirA can be expressed in the cytosol in mammalian cells, reacting only with BAP exposed to the cytosol (26Petris G. Vecchi L. Bestagno M. Burrone O.R. Efficient detection of proteins retro-translocated from the ER to the cytosol by in vivo biotinylation.PLoS One. 2011; 6e23712Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, a luminally expressed BirA (sec-BirA) labels BAP when exposed to the ER lumen. We have made constructs expressing BAP-tagged S1R, with the tag on the N-terminus (BAP-S1R) or C-terminus (S1R-BAP). If the protein has a type II orientation, S1R-BAP should be biotinylated by sec-BirA and not by BirA and vice versa for BAP-S1R. Conversely, if it has a type III orientation, S1R-BAP should be biotinylated by BirA and not by sec-BirA and vice versa for BAP-S1R (Fig. 1B). An SV5 tag was added next to the BAP tag, to detect the protein independently of biotinylation. The tagged proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells together with BirA or sec-BirA, and the cells were incubated with biotin. Cell lysates (prepared in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide to prevent postlysis biotinylation) were immunoblotted with anti-V5 to detect total levels of the proteins, or with Streptavidin linked to HRP (Strep-HRP) to detect only biotinylated molecules. The results show biotinylation of S1R-BAP by sec-BirA and only to a minor extent (∼25% of total) by BirA, suggesting a mostly type II orientation (Fig. 1, C and E). This was similar to the results obtained with a BAP-tagged construct made with a protein known to have a type II orientation, asialoglycoprotein receptor H2a (27Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. Membrane-bound versus secreted forms of human asialoglycoprotein receptor subunits - role of a juxtamembrane pentapeptide.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14496-14503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, D and E). The small amount of labeling by BirA probably reflects molecules that have undergone retrotranslocation toward ERAD ((26Petris G. Vecchi L. Bestagno M. Burrone O.R. Efficient detection of proteins retro-translocated from the ER to the cytosol by in vivo biotinylation.PLoS One. 2011; 6e23712Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28Sasset L. Petris G.

Chem. 2015; 290: 28175-28188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and our unpublished results). In contrast to S1R-BAP, BAP-S1R was biotinylated to a similar extent by both BirA and sec-BirA (Fig. 1, C and E). This result was surprising and might be due to the N-terminal tag affecting the membrane orientation of the protein, giving equal probability for insertion in the two opposite orientations. This effect of the tag might explain the conflicting results in other studies that used S1R with other tags (4Hayashi T. Su T.P.

The orientation of H2a with a BAP-tag in the N-terminus (BAP-H2a) was affected to some degree, but still showed a predominant type II orientation (63% of total BAP-H2a) (Fig. 1, D and E). We analyzed whether the tags affect the oligomerization of the S1R. For this, we separated Triton-insoluble species (higher order oligomers (31Hayashi T. Fujimoto M. Detergent-resistant microdomains determine the localization of sigma-1 receptors to the endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria junction.Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 77: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar)) and kept the lysates at 4 °C before SDS-PAGE, which prevents dissociation of S1R dimers (32Yano H. Liu L. Naing S. Shi L. The effects of terminal tagging on homomeric interactions of the sigma 1 receptor.Front. Neurosci. 2019; 13: 1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To avoid the formation of mixed oligomers, we performed these experiments by expressing the constructs in HEK293 cells where S1R was deleted using CRISPR/Cas9 technology (S1R−/−) (15Shenkman M. Geva M. Gershoni-Emek N. Hayden M.R. Lederkremer G.Z. Pridopidine reduces mutant huntingtin-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress by modulation of the Sigma-1 receptor.J. Neurochem. 2021; 158: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Whereas C-terminal BAP tagging caused a small increase in dimerization and did not affect association into higher-order oligomers, N-terminal tagging reduced significantly the presence of dimers (Fig. 2, A and C) and Triton-insoluble species (Fig. 2, B and C) compared with WT untagged S1R. Given the confounding effect of N-terminal tagging, we decided to determine the topology of untagged S1R. We applied a classical protease protection assay on microsomes prepared from S1R−/− HEK293 cells transfected with WT S1R and compared with S1R-BAP and H2a-BAP. The microsomes were treated with proteinase K after treatment or not with 1% SDS. All three proteins were completely digested in the presence of SDS and were protected from the protease in the absence of SDS (Fig. 3A). Both S1R and S1R-BAP showed a small shift, using anti-S1R or anti-V5 antibodies for the latter, indicating a cleavage by proteinase K of a peptide of ∼1.3 kD, which is consistent with digestion of the small cytosolic tail in a type II orientation (Fig. 3B). H2a-BAP showed a larger cleavage of ∼6 kD, which is the size of its cytosolic tail. As controls, a luminal protein, BiP-RFP showed complete protection in the absence of SDS and calnexin (CNX), a type I membrane protein, was no longer recognized by an anti-C terminal antibody, in the absence or presence of SDS (Fig. 3A). To discard any changes that might take place during the manipulation needed for the preparation of microsomes, we used another approach to reveal the topology of untagged S1R in intact cells. S1R is a nonglycosylated protein. To analyze the orientation of untagged S1R, we made different constructs where individual N-glycosylation sites were introduced and expressed them in S1R−/− HEK293 cells. As N-glycosylation takes place only in the ER lumen, these constructs should reveal the orientation of the protein. N-glycosylation does not affect the normal topology of the protein as the N-glycans are added only after translocation into the ER lumen of a given segment containing an N-glycosylation sequon. N-glycosylation sites were introduced at exposed hydrophilic regions and with minimal effects on polarity (Fig. 4A). A viability assay was used to test if the constructs expressed functional S1R, which would protect cells from ER stress-induced cytotoxicity caused by long-term incubation with thapsigargin (TG). S1R functionality would reflect a native conformation. All constructs protected the cells to a similar or slightly higher extent than WT S1R, except for S1R L214N, which showed a lower, although still significant protection (Fig. 4B). Constructs with N-glycosylation sites near the N-terminus, S1R A4N and S1R T32N, resulted in proteins with no change in migration in SDS-PAGE compared with WT S1R, suggesting no glycosylation at these sites (Fig. 4C). In contrast, a construct with a more C-terminal N-glycosylation site, S1R Q44N, and one near the C-terminus, S1R L214N, resulted in a slower migration in SDS-PAGE compared with WT S1R, consistent with N-glycosylation at these sites. We observed the same differences between these proteins when expressed in S1R+/+ or S1R1−/− cells (Fig. 4C). Only a minority of S1R Q44N (14%) and S1R L214N molecules (18%) were not glycosylated, measured in S1R1−/− cells. These results suggest that most of the protein, including its C-terminus, is in the ER lumen. The T32N site is in the lumen, but too close to the TMD (residues 10–31) to be glycosylated, as a stretch of a minimum of 12 residues C-terminal to a membrane span is needed for N-glycosylation to take place (33Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. Determination of the distance between the oligosaccharyltransferase active site and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4D). An opposite orientation, with the N-terminus in the ER lumen would have resulted in no glycosylation for any of the constructs, as the S1R A4N is also too close to the membrane span. The results suggest a type II transmembrane protein topology. To test whether the topology or orientation of the S1R constructs was affected by an S1R agonist, we incubated S1R−/− HEK293 cells expressing WT S1R or the constructs with added N-glycosylation sites with the S1R agonist Pre-084 (34Mancuso R. Olivan S. Rando A. Casas C. Osta R. Navarro X. Sigma-1R agonist improves motor function and motoneuron survival in ALS mice.Neurotherapeutics. 2012; 9: 814-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). There was no change in the migration in SDS-PAGE for any of the constructs with or without Pre-084 incubation (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained with the S1R agonist pridopidine (35Eddings C.R. Arbez N. Akimov S. Geva M. Hayden M.R. Ross C.A. Pridopidine protects neurons from mutant-huntingtin toxicity via the sigma-1 receptor.Neurobiol. Dis. 2019; 129: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Sahlholm K. Sijbesma J.W. Maas B. Kwizera C. Marcellino D. Ramakrishnan N.K. Dierckx R.A. Elsinga P.H. van Waarde A. Pridopidine selectively occupies sigma-1 rather than dopamine D2 receptors at behaviorally active doses.Psychopharmacology. 2015; 232: 3443-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B). We then analyzed the extent of ER exit of the proteins by measuring their resistance to endo-β-N-glycosaminidase H (endo H), which cleaves high-mannose type N-glycans. N-glycans are processed in the Golgi to complex-type sugar chains, acquiring resistance to endo H. Endo H treatment caused no change in the migration of WT, S1R A4N, and S1R T32N, as they are not glycosylated. In contrast, endo H treatment of S1R Q44N and S1R L214N changed their migration to a position similar to the WT S1R (Fig. 6A). There were few if any S1R Q44N and S1R L214N molecules that were resistant to endo H. To discard the possibility that even though they exit to the Golgi, these proteins carry high mannose N-glycans that are not converted to complex-type, cells were treated with brefeldin A (BFA). BFA causes ER-Golgi fusion and therefore delivers Golgi enzymes to the ER. When cells expressing S1R L214N were treated with BFA, the glycoprotein became partially (34 %) endo H resistant (Fig. 6A, rightmost lane). This result indicates that the S1R L214N N-glycan is capable of undergoing processing by Golgi enzymes to an endo H-resistant form, but is normally totally endo H-sensitive, suggesting complete ER retention. As S1R agonists were reported to translocate the protein to or near the plasma membrane (17Morin-Surun M.P. Collin T. Denavit-Saubie M. Baulieu E.E. Monnet F.P. Intracellular sigma1 receptor modulates phospholipase C and protein kinase C activities in the brainstem.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8196-8199Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we tested whether they cause any change in the endo H sensitivity. Neither Pre-084 nor pridopidine changed the endo H sensitivity of S1R Q44N or S1R L214N (Fig. 6, B and C). We also tested whether ER stress causes any changes, because the S1R is activated by ER stress (37Mitsuda T. Omi T. Tanimukai H. Sakagami Y. Tagami S. Okochi M. Kudo T. Takeda M. Sigma-1Rs are upregulated via PERK/eIF2alpha/ATF4 pathway and execute protective function in ER stress.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 415: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Incubation of cells with TG for 16 h did not change the endo H sensitivity of the glycosylated S1R constructs (Fig. 6D). Although the results suggest that no S1R exits the ER, we wanted to test whether any molecules reach the cell surface. With this aim we first used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) on nonpermeabilized S1R−/− cells expressing S1R or endogenous S1R in HEK293 cells. As a positive control, we measured the surface expression of an unassembled receptor subunit, asialoglycoprotein receptor H1, which can exit the ER and reach the cell surface but only to a modest extent (27Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. Membrane-bound versus secreted forms of human asialoglycoprotein receptor subunits - role of a juxtamembrane pentapeptide.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14496-14503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A very minor cell surface signal, although statistically significant, was observed for both transfected and endogenous S1R using anti-S1R antibodies (which recognize an epitope that should be exposed if S1R reaches the cell surface (Fig. 7A and Fig. S2)). In contrast, H1 showed strong surface fluorescence. When analyzing permeabilized cells, the signals obtained for S1R and H1 were of similar magnitude (Fig. 7B). The ratio of cell surface (nonpermeabilized cells) to total (permeabilized cells) was ∼30% for H1 and only ∼4% for S1R. Cell incubation with Pre-084 caused only a small increase in this ratio. We also analyzed the cell surface expression of BAP-S1R, reasoning that the altered topology caused by an N-terminal tag might affect the ER retention, but it also gave a very minor cell surface signal in the absence or presence of the agonist (Fig. S2). Therefore, only a minor fraction of S1R, if any, appears to reach the cell surface (Fig. 7C). We then used another approach and applied a sensitive and specific surface biotinylation approach, using the membrane-impermeant reagent sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin). Biotinylated cell surface proteins from S1R−/− cells expressing WT S1R or S1R L214N were precipitated from cell lysates using streptavidin-agarose beads and immunoblotted with anti-S1R compared with total S1R. A weak signal of biotinylated S1R could be observed only upon overexposure of the blot and accounted for 2.2% of total WT S1R and 2.8% of total S1R L214N (Fig. 8, A and D and Fig. S3). There was no change when cells were treated with Pre-084. H1, when expressed in S1R−/− cells showed 12.7% of cell surface expression (Fig. 8, B and D). We also analyzed H1 expression in S1R+/+ cells, where it showed similar levels of cell surface biotinylated protein. To evaluate the significance of the low percent of surface S1R, we immunoblotted the same biotinylated samples with anti-CNX antibodies, as this is an ER-retained chaperone. Cell surface-biotinylated molecules of CNX were 1.7% of the total CNX in WT S1R expressing cells and 3.2% in S1R L214N expressing cells, not significantly different than the cell surface labeling obtained for the S1R (Fig. 8, C and D). Altogether, these results suggest that the S1R is an ER resident protein, not exiting the ER to any meaningful extent. Previous studies of the S1R suggested a wide variety of topologies, including two TMDs, with both N- and C- termini facing the cytosol (21Aydar E. Palmer C.P. Klyachko V.A. Jackson M.B.

https://openalex.org/W3206745679,"Lamin A/C provides a nuclear scaffold for compartmentalization of genome function that is important for genome integrity. Lamin A/C dysfunction is associated with cancer, aging, and degenerative diseases. The mechanisms whereby lamin A/C regulates genome stability remain poorly understood. We demonstrate a crucial role for lamin A/C in DNA replication. Lamin A/C binds to nascent DNA, especially during replication stress (RS), ensuring the recruitment of replication fork protective factors RPA and RAD51. These ssDNA-binding proteins, considered the first and second responders to RS respectively, function in the stabilization, remodeling, and repair of the stalled fork to ensure proper restart and genome stability. Reduced recruitment of RPA and RAD51 upon lamin A/C depletion elicits replication fork instability (RFI) characterized by MRE11 nuclease-mediated degradation of nascent DNA, RS-induced DNA damage, and sensitivity to replication inhibitors. Importantly, unlike homologous recombination-deficient cells, RFI in lamin A/C-depleted cells is not linked to replication fork reversal. Thus, the point of entry of nucleases is not the reversed fork but regions of ssDNA generated during RS that are not protected by RPA and RAD51. Consistently, RFI in lamin A/C-depleted cells is rescued by exogenous overexpression of RPA or RAD51. These data unveil involvement of structural nuclear proteins in the protection of ssDNA from nucleases during RS by promoting recruitment of RPA and RAD51 to stalled forks. Supporting this model, we show physical interaction between RPA and lamin A/C. We suggest that RS is a major source of genomic instability in laminopathies and lamin A/C-deficient tumors."

Good knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of hepatitis B infection (HBI) prevention are essential for HBI control. However, there is limited evidence concerning the KAP of HBI prevention among nursing students, who are significantly exposed to HBI. We assessed the KAP of HBI prevention and the factors associated with the practice of HBI prevention among nursing students in the Upper West Region of Ghana.We administered an online cross-sectional survey in November 2020 to a stratified random sample of 402 nursing students in two nursing training colleges in the Upper West Region. Using STATA version 13, we computed composite scores of KAP of HBI prevention with maximum scores of 18 for knowledge and 8 each for attitude and practice. A generalised ordered logistic regression model was run to assess the factors associated with the practice of HBI prevention.The students had moderate median scores for knowledge (12.00; IQR = 10-13) and attitude (6.00; IQR = 5.00-7.00) but a poor median score (5.00; IQR = 4.00-6.00) for the practice of HBI prevention. High knowledge (aOR = 2.05; p = 0.06), good attitude, being a male, second year student and having parents with tertiary education were significantly associated with higher likelihoods (aOR >1; p < 0.05) of demonstrating good practice of HBI prevention. Students who had never married were significantly (aOR = 0.34; p = 0.010) less likely to exhibit good practice of HBI prevention.The KAP scores of HBI prevention among the students were sub-optimal. We recommend institution-based policies and regular education on HBI prevention, free/subsidised HBI prevention services, and the enforcement of proper professional ethics on HBI prevention in nursing training colleges. Such interventions should predominantly target female, non-married and first year nursing students."
https://openalex.org/W3207366201,"Aberrant glucose metabolism and elevated O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAcylation) are hallmarks of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Loss of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), the major rate-limiting enzyme of hepatic gluconeogenesis, increases hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP)-mediated protein O-GlcNAcylation in hepatoma cell and promotes cell growth and proliferation. However, whether PCK1 deficiency and hyper O-GlcNAcylation can induce HCC metastasis is largely unknown. Here, gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrate that PCK1 suppresses HCC metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, lysine acetyltransferase 5 (KAT5), belonging to the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases (HAT), is highly modified by O-GlcNAcylation in PCK1 knockout hepatoma cells. Mechanistically, PCK1 depletion suppressed KAT5 ubiquitination by increasing its O-GlcNAcylation, thereby stabilizing KAT5. KAT5 O-GlcNAcylation epigenetically activates TWIST1 expression via histone H4 acetylation, and enhances MMP9 and MMP14 expression via c-Myc acetylation, thus promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC. In addition, targeting HBP-mediated O-GlcNAcylation of KAT5 inhibits lung metastasis of HCC in hepatospecific Pck1-deletion mice. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PCK1 depletion increases O-GlcNAcylation of KAT5, epigenetically induces TWIST1 expression and promotes HCC metastasis, and link metabolic enzyme, post-translational modification (PTM) with epigenetic regulation."

Specifically, we examine the complementary or substitution relationship between digital credit and traditional bank credit and the impact of participation in e-commerce on the scale of digital credit of rural households. The empirical results show that there is a substitution relationship between digital credit and traditional bank credit. Participation in e-commerce has a positive impact on the scale of digital credit and the full scale of credit obtained by farmers, with an increase of $0.922 million and $37.49 million in the scale of digital credit and real credit received by farmers who participate in e-commerce, respectively, compared with those who do not participate in e-commerce. Further tests revealed that the difference in capital endowment was an essential reason for the disparity in the size of digital credit received among e-commerce farmers."
https://openalex.org/W3131729262,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory viral illness causing pneumonia and systemic disease. Abnormalities in pulmonary function tests (PFT) after COVID-19 infection have been described. The determinants of these abnormalities are unclear. We hypothesized that inflammatory biomarkers and CT scan parameters at the time of infection would be associated with abnormal gas transfer at short term follow-up.We retrospectively studied subjects who were hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and discharged. Serum inflammatory biomarkers, CT scan and clinical characteristics were assessed. CT images were evaluated by Functional Respiratory Imaging with automated tissue segmentation algorithms of the lungs and pulmonary vasculature. Volumes of the pulmonary vessels that were ≤5mm (BV5), 5-10mm (BV5_10), and ≥10mm (BV10) in cross sectional area were analyzed. Also the amount of opacification on CT (ground glass opacities). PFT were performed 2-3 months after discharge. The diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) was obtained. We divided subjects into those with a DLCO <80% predicted (Low DLCO) and those with a DLCO ≥80% predicted (Normal DLCO).38 subjects were included in our cohort. 31 out of 38 (81.6%) subjects had a DLCO<80% predicted. The groups were similar in terms of demographics, body mass index, comorbidities, and smoking status. Hemoglobin, inflammatory biomarkers, spirometry and lung volumes were similar between groups. CT opacification and BV5 were not different between groups, but both Low and Normal DLCO groups had lower BV5 measures compared to healthy controls. BV5_10 and BV10 measures were higher in the Low DLCO group compared to the normal DLCO group. Both BV5_10 and BV10 in the Low DLCO group were greater compared to healthy controls. BV5_10 was independently associated with DLCO<80% in multivariable logistic regression (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01, 1.64). BV10 negatively correlated with DLCO% predicted (r = -0.343, p = 0.035).Abnormalities in pulmonary vascular volumes at the time of hospitalization are independently associated with a low DLCO at follow-up. There was no relationship between inflammatory biomarkers during hospitalization and DLCO. Pulmonary vascular abnormalities during hospitalization for COVID-19 may serve as a biomarker for abnormal gas transfer after COVID-19 pneumonia."

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and impact of pre-surgical clinical depression on pain and other outcomes after surgery for cervical degenerative disc disease using a national representative database. Data of patients with cervical myelopathy and radiculopathy were extracted from the 2005-2014 US Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Included patients underwent anterior discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Acute or chronic post-surgical pain, postoperative complications, unfavorable discharge, length of stay (LOS) and hospital costs were evaluated. Totally 215,684 patients were included. Pre-surgical depression was found in 29,889 (13.86%) patients, with a prevalence nearly doubled during 2005-2014 in the US. Depression was independently associated with acute or chronic post-surgical pain (aOR: 1.432), unfavorable discharge (aOR: 1.311), prolonged LOS (aOR: 1.152), any complication (aOR: 1.232), respiratory complications/pneumonia (aOR: 1.153), dysphagia (aOR: 1.105), bleeding (aOR: 1.085), infection/sepsis (aOR: 1.529), and higher hospital costs (beta: 1080.640) compared to non-depression. No significant risk of delirium or venous thrombotic events was observed in patients with depression as compared to non-depression. Among patients receiving primary surgery, depression was independently associated with prolonged LOS (aOR: 1.150), any complication (aOR:1.233) and postoperative pain (aOR:1.927). In revision surgery, no significant associations were found for prolonged LOS, any complication or pain. In conclusion, in the US patients undergoing ACDF, pre-surgical clinical depression predicts post-surgical acute or chronic pain, a slightly prolonged LOS and the presence of any complication. Awareness of these associations may help clinicians stratify risk preoperatively and optimize patient care."
https://openalex.org/W3207137208,"Many breast cancer patients experience significant distress immediately following the completion of primary treatment. Women who report low levels of quality of life (QOL) early in this phase of transitional survivorship tend to experience diminished long-term adjustment. However, since most of the prior studies on survivors were conducted on patients at various times, studies on QOL of women during the end of primary treatment have been insufficient. This study aimed to identify determinants of QOL in women with breast cancer immediately following the completion of treatment.A cross-sectional study was conducted on 140 disease-free breast cancer patients who had completed therapy in the past 1 month at university hospitals. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form (MSAS-SF), Self-Efficacy Scale for Self-Management of Breast Cancer (SESSM-B), and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List-12 (ISEL-12) scales were used to assess predictors and QOL. The data were analyzed using the Pearson correlation, t-test, ANOVA, and hierarchical multiple regression.The mean score of QOL for breast cancer survivors was 97.23 (±20.01). Chemotherapy and perceived economic status were significantly associated with QOL in terms of sociodemographic and disease/treatment-related characteristics. Physical and psychological symptoms and social support had a significant association with QOL. The regression analyses showed that physical and psychological symptoms and belonging support were statistically significant in predicting the QOL of breast cancer survivors.The variables of symptom experience and social support must be acknowledged when improving women's QOL immediately after their completion of primary breast cancer treatment. Greater focus on the reduction of symptom distress and increasing a sense of belonging could improve QOL among breast cancer survivors."
https://openalex.org/W3207566749,"Fluorescence microscopy, which visualizes cellular components with fluorescent stains, is an invaluable method in image cytometry. From these images various cellular features can be extracted. Together these features form phenotypes that can be used to determine effective drug therapies, such as those based on nanomedicines. Unfortunately, fluorescence microscopy is time-consuming, expensive, labour intensive, and toxic to the cells. Bright-field images lack these downsides but also lack the clear contrast of the cellular components and hence are difficult to use for downstream analysis. Generating the fluorescence images directly from bright-field images using virtual staining (also known as ""label-free prediction"" and ""in-silico labeling"") can get the best of both worlds, but can be very challenging to do for poorly visible cellular structures in the bright-field images. To tackle this problem deep learning models were explored to learn the mapping between bright-field and fluorescence images for adipocyte cell images. The models were tailored for each imaging channel, paying particular attention to the various challenges in each case, and those with the highest fidelity in extracted cell-level features were selected. The solutions included utilizing privileged information for the nuclear channel, and using image gradient information and adversarial training for the lipids channel. The former resulted in better morphological and count features and the latter resulted in more faithfully captured defects in the lipids, which are key features required for downstream analysis of these channels."

However, there is a paucity of information on identifying the point where deterioration of the bacteriological quality of drinking water occurs (source or point of use) and associated factors among households in developing countries, especially in Ethiopia.A community based cross-sectional study design was conducted among 425 households in Eastern Ethiopia. Households with at least one child under-five years of age were included in the study. A total of 448 Water samples (425 from households and 23 from water sources) were collected and analyzed by the membrane filtration method to identify Thermotolerant coliform. Binary logistic regression was performed to assess the association between each independent and dependent variable. Adjusted Odd Ratios along with 95% Confidence intervals were estimated to identify factors associated with the outcome variable.This study revealed that 21.7%; 95% CI (4.5%, 39.1%) of water sources and 83.3%; 95% CI (79.8%, 87.1%) of households' drinking water were contaminated by thermotolerant coliform. Drinking water samples from households with poor wealth index [AOR = 9.63; 95%CI (2.92, 31.69)], households with unimproved sanitation facility [AOR = 2.81; 95%CI (1.31, 6.01)], households which shares their house with animal [AOR = 3.73; 95%CI (1.66, 8.37)], households that didn't practice household water treatment [AOR = 3.42; 95%CI (1.60, 7.31)] and not washing hands before water collection [AOR = 7.04; 95%CI (2.22, 22.30)] were significantly associated with deterioration of bacteriological quality of household drinking water.This study indicates that the bacteriological quality of drinking water deteriorates from source to point of use.

We designed a longitudinal study to evaluate the association between work environment characteristics and the patient safety climate in hospital units.Primary data were collected from Norwegian hospital staff from 970 clinical units in all 21 hospitals of the South-Eastern Norway Health Region using the validated Norwegian Work Environment Survey and the Norwegian version of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire. Responses from 91,225 surveys were collected over a three year period. We calculated the factor mean score and a binary outcome to measure study outcomes. The relationship between the hospital unit characteristics and the observed changes in the safety climate was analyzed by linear and logistic regression models.A work environment conducive to safe incident reporting, innovation, and teamwork was found to be significant for positive changes in the safety climate. In addition, a work environment supportive of patient needs and staff commitment to their workplace was significant for maintaining a mature safety climate over time.A supportive work environment is essential for patient safety. The characteristics of the hospital units were significantly associated with the unit's safety climate scores, hence improvements in working conditions are needed for enhancing patient safety."

In 2010, Sierra Leone introduced the Free Health Care Initiative (FHCI), a national financial risk protection program for the most vulnerable groups. Aim of this study was to investigate catastrophic expenditure and impoverishment related to caesarean section in Sierra Leone and evaluate the impact of the FHCI.Women who delivered by caesarean section in nine hospitals were followed up with home visits one month after surgery, and data on medical and non-medical expenditures were collected. Individual income was estimated based on household characteristics and used to determine catastrophic expenditure and impoverishment for each patient. The impact of the FHCI was assessed by comparing actual expenditure with counterfactual expenditures had the initiative not existed.For the 1146 patients in the study, the median expenditure was 23 (IQR 4; 56) international dollars (Int$). Patients in the poorest quintile spent a median Int$ 59 (IQR 28; 76), which was significantly more than patients in the richest quintile, who spent a median Int$ 17 (IQR 2; 38, p<0.001). Travel (32.9%) and food (28.7%) were the two largest expenses. Catastrophic expenditure was encountered by 12.0% and 4.0% (10% and 25% threshold, respectively) of the women. Without the FHCI, 66.1% and 28.8% of the women would have encountered catastrophic expenditure.Many women in Sierra Leone face catastrophic expenditure related to caesarean section, mainly through food and travel expenses, and the poor are disproportionally affected. The FHCI is effective in reducing the risk of catastrophic expenditure related to caesarean section, but many patients are still exposed to financial hardship, suggesting that additional support is needed for Sierra Leone's poorest patients."

The specific status of several species grouped in the T . brasiliensis complex was confirmed from experimental crossing and analysis of reproductive barriers. Thus, we perform interspecific experimental crosses between T . lenti and other species and subspecies of the T . brasiliensis complex and perform morphological analysis of the gonads and cytogenetic analysis in the homeologous chromosomes of the hybrids of first generation (F1). Besides that, we rescue all the literature data associated with the study of reproductive barriers in this monophyletic complex of species and subspecies. For all crosses performed between T . b . brasiliensis , T . b . macromelasoma , T . juazeirensis and T . melanica with T . lenti , interspecific copulas occurred (showing absence of mechanical isolation), hybrids were obtained, none of the male hybrids presented the phenomenon of gonadal dysgenesis and 100% pairing between the chromosomes homeologous of the hybrids was observed. Thus, we demonstrate that there are no pre-zygotic reproductive barriers installed between T . lenti and the species and subspecies of the T . brasiliensis complex. In addition, we demonstrate that the hybrids obtained between these crosses have high genomic compatibility and the absence of gonadal dysgenesis. These results point to reproductive compatibility between T . lenti and species and subspecies of the T . brasiliensis complex (confirming its inclusion in the complex) and lead us to suggest a possible recent diversification of the taxa of this monophyletic group."
https://openalex.org/W3206440104,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) mediated by β-lactamases is the major and leading cause of resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins among Gram-negative bacteria. β-Lactamases, periplasmic enzymes that are widely distributed in the bacterial world, protect penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), the major cell wall synthesizing enzymes, from inactivation by β-lactam antibiotics. Developing novel PBP inhibitors with a non-β-lactam scaffold could potentially evade this resistance mechanism. Based on the structural similarities between the evolutionary related serine β-lactamases and PBPs, we investigated whether the potent β-lactamase inhibitor, vaborbactam, could also form an acyl-enzyme complex with Pseudomonas aeruginosa PBP3. We found that this cyclic boronate, vaborbactam, inhibited PBP3 (IC50 of 262 μM), and its binding to PBP3 increased the protein thermal stability by about 2°C. Crystallographic analysis of the PBP3:vaborbactam complex reveals that vaborbactam forms a covalent bond with the catalytic S294. The amide moiety of vaborbactam hydrogen bonds with N351 and the backbone oxygen of T487. The carboxyl group of vaborbactam hydrogen bonds with T487, S485, and S349. The thiophene ring and cyclic boronate ring of vaborbactam form hydrophobic interactions, including with V333 and Y503. The active site of the vaborbactam-bound PBP3 harbors the often observed ligand-induced formation of the aromatic wall and hydrophobic bridge, yet the residues involved in this wall and bridge display much higher temperature factors compared to PBP3 structures bound to high-affinity β-lactams. These insights could form the basis for developing more potent novel cyclic boronate-based PBP inhibitors to inhibit these targets and overcome β-lactamases-mediated resistance mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3205222917,"Following the introduction of Highly Active Anti Retro Viral Treatment (HAART), the survival of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) has improved. However, hypertension remains a major challenge for people living with HIV. Very little effort has been made to examine the magnitude of hypertension and its contributing factors among clients receiving HAART, particularly in southern Ethiopia. Hence, the current study aimed at determining the frequency of Hypertension and associated factors among clients receiving HAART at Wachemo University Nigist Eleni Mohammed Memorial Referral Hospital, southern Ethiopia, 2020.A hospital-based cross-sectional study took place from January 20- March 20, 2020. A systematic sampling technique was employed in the selection of 397 clients. Interviewer administered pretested structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Blood pressure and anthropometric parameters of PLHIV were measured. The data was encoded and entered using Epi Data Version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Then bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify associated factors. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% CI was used to present the estimated effect size and declare the presence of statistically significant association respectively.The magnitude of hypertension among clients on HAART was 11.0% 95% CI [7.93, 14.04]. Being on HAART for at least 60 months (AOR: 2.57, 95% CI: 1.24-5.21), being on TDF/3TC/EFV combination (AOR: 4.61, 95% CI: 2.52-8.3), and high alcohol consumption (AOR: 4.31, 95% CI: 1.84-10.02) were identified as significant predictors of hypertension among clients on HAART.The magnitude of hypertension in the study area was in a considerable state to plan and implement intervention measures. For those clients who have received TDF/3TC/EFV and TDF/3TC/NVP and those who have been on HAART for 60 months, a strong emphasis should be placed on planning a strict follow-up. A concerted effort among health care providers is needed through counseling and education to discourage the habit of high alcohol consumption among clients."
https://openalex.org/W3205866256,"Highly organized circuits of enteric neurons are required for the regulation of gastrointestinal functions, such as peristaltism or migrating motor complex. However, the factors and molecular mechanisms that regulate the connectivity of enteric neurons and their assembly into functional neuronal networks are largely unknown. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which neurotrophic factors regulate this enteric neuron circuitry is paramount to understanding enteric nervous system (ENS) physiology. EphB2, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is essential for neuronal connectivity and plasticity in the brain, but so far its presence and function in the ENS remain largely unexplored. Here we report that EphB2 is expressed preferentially by enteric neurons relative to glial cells throughout the gut in rats. We show that in primary enteric neurons, activation of EphB2 by its natural ligand ephrinB2 engages ERK signaling pathways. Long-term activation with ephrinB2 decreases EphB2 expression and reduces molecular and functional connectivity in enteric neurons without affecting neuronal density, ganglionic fiber bundles, or overall neuronal morphology. This is highlighted by a loss of neuronal plasticity markers such as synapsin I, PSD95, and synaptophysin, and a decrease of spontaneous miniature synaptic currents. Together, these data identify a critical role for EphB2 in the ENS and reveal a unique EphB2-mediated molecular program of synapse regulation in enteric neurons.

Together, these data identify a critical role for EphB2 in the ENS and reveal a unique EphB2-mediated molecular program of synapse regulation in enteric neurons. Assembly and maintenance of neurons into organized ganglia and the growth, guidance, and connectivity of axons and dendrites are necessary for the establishment of a fine-tuned neural circuitry in the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS consists of a complex network of neurons and glia that functions autonomously to provide neural control of major gastrointestinal functions (1Furness J.B. The enteric nervous system and neurogastroenterology.Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2012; 9: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). This neuronal network is arranged in two major plexus, i.e., the submucosal and myenteric plexus (2Wedel T. Roblick U. Gleiss J. Schiedeck T. Bruch H.P. Kuhnel W. Krammer H.J. Organization of the enteric nervous system in the human colon demonstrated by wholemount immunohistochemistry with special reference to the submucous plexus.Ann. Anat. 1999; 181: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The early developmental phases of the ENS derived from the neural crest (i.e., migration, proliferation, differentiation) have been extensively studied (1Furness J.B. The enteric nervous system and neurogastroenterology.Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2012; 9: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 3Nagy N. Goldstein A.M. Enteric nervous system development: A crest cell's journey from neural tube to colon.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 66: 94-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, mechanisms controlling axon guidance, connectivity of enteric neurons and molecules implicated in these processes remain poorly defined not only during development but also in adulthood. For instance, key proteins referred to as synaptic-associated proteins (SAPs) such as synapsin I, synaptophysin, and PSD95 appear to be crucial determinants for the fine-tuning of synaptic transmission and for synaptic remodeling in the central nervous system (CNS). SAPs are recognized to play a key role in synaptic mechanisms (i.e., neurotransmitter release, vesicle trafficking) and in the stabilization of synaptic structures in the ENS and the CNS (4Rosahl T.W. Spillane D. Missler M. Herz J. Selig D.K. Wolff J.R. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Sudhof T.C.

The relationship between PSD-95 clustering and spine stability in vivo.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 2075-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For example, in varicosities of the mouse ENS, PSD95 has been shown to be critical for nitrergic neurotransmission (7Chaudhury A. He X.D. Goyal R.K. Role of PSD95 in membrane association and catalytic activity of nNOSalpha in nitrergic varicosities in mice gut.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2009; 297: G806-G813Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the CNS, overexpressing PSD95 in cortical neurons reduced the turnover rates of pre- and postsynaptic structures, thus promoting the stabilization of synaptic contacts (8Taft C.E. Turrigiano G.G. PSD-95 promotes the stabilization of young synaptic contacts.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2014; https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2013.0134Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, in the CNS, a direct interaction between PSD95 and ephrinB3 controls PSD95 localization within synapses and promotes synapse density in cortical neurons (9Hruska M. Dalva M.B. Ephrin regulation of synapse formation, function and plasticity.Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2012; 50: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Synaptophysin is involved in membrane fusion and neurotransmitter release in the CNS (10Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R.

Moreover, increasing synaptophysin expression promotes the formation of neuronal network (12Bottner M. Harde J. Barrenschee M. Hellwig I. Vogel I. Ebsen M. Wedel T. GDNF induces synaptic vesicle markers in enteric neurons.Neurosci. Res. 2013; 77: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Synapsins play a major functional role in both the assembly/maintenance of the reserve pool of synaptic vesicles and release during hippocampal neuronal activity (13Greengard P. Valtorta F. Czernik A.J. Benfenati F. Synaptic vesicle phosphoproteins and regulation of synaptic function.Science. 1993; 259: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar) and in synapse formation (14Cesca F. Baldelli P.

Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 3643-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, their role and the underlying mechanism regulating their expression in the ENS have been less studied. In this context, the neurotrophic factor EphB2 represents a candidate of choice since it has been largely described as a key regulator of neuronal connectivity and plasticity in hippocampal neurons (16Talebian A.

EphB2 is a member of the eph receptor tyrosine kinase family, members of which are ubiquitously expressed in epithelial and neuronal cells and involved in a variety of developmental processes, neuronal growth, and connectivity/plasticity (19Kania A. Klein R. Mechanisms of ephrin-Eph signalling in development, physiology and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 240-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Fourteen Eph receptors encoded in the human genome are divided into A (EphA1–EphA8 and EphA10) and B (EphB1–EphB4 and EphB6) classes activated by binding to eight different ephrin ligands (9Hruska M.

For instance, ephrinB2-dependant activation of EphB2 induces its tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to an interaction with Kalirin-7 (29Sommer J.E. Budreck E.C. Kalirin-7: Linking spine plasticity and behavior.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 5367-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and the Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor in a kinase-dependent manner (27Tolias K.F. Bikoff J.B. Kane C.G. Tolias C.S.

This interaction promotes a Rac1-dependent actin cytoskeletal remodeling required for dendritic spine morphogenesis in hippocampal neurons (25Penzes P. Beeser A. Chernoff J. Schiller M.R.

Recently, Memic et al. (30Memic F. Knoflach V. Morarach K. Sadler R. Laranjeira C. Hjerling-Leffler J. Sundstrom E. Pachnis V. Marklund U. Transcription and signaling regulators in developing neuronal Subtypes of mouse and human enteric nervous system.Gastroenterology. 2018; 154: 624-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) identified the expression patterns of ephrin/Eph in the developing mouse and human ENS. Furthermore, a recent study showed that EphB2 was expressed on colonic enteric nerves and could regulate the expression of key molecules involved in synaptic sprouting of myenteric nerves via ERK-MAPK and PI3K–protein kinase B pathways in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (31Zhang L. Wang R. Bai T. Xiang X. Qian W. Song J. Hou X. EphrinB2/ephB2-mediated myenteric synaptic plasticity: Mechanisms underlying the persistent muscle hypercontractility and pain in postinfectious IBS.FASEB J. 2019; 33: 13644-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of additional pathways and the functional impact of EphB2 on enteric neuronal connectivity remain unknown. Therefore, here we investigate EphB2 spatial localization and signaling in the myenteric plexus of the rat colon and primary cultures of enteric neurons, respectively. Furthermore, we examine its involvement in enteric neuronal connectivity and plasticity through biochemical and electrophysiological approaches. First, we assessed the regional expression of EphB2 in rat small (jejunum and ileum) and large (colon) intestine. Western blot analysis showed that EphB2 is relatively present in all those segments with additional EphB2-derived fragments detectable and neuronal marker PGP9.5 more expressed in the colon (Fig. 1, A and D). Although the same amount of proteins was loaded for analysis, ponceau S (Fig. 1B) and Coomassie blue (Fig. 1C) stainings showed a difference in the overall protein profil/content between intestinal segments. Interestingly, we found no difference in levels of EphB2 transcripts between intestinal segments (Fig. 1E), suggesting the involvement of a posttranscriptional regulation. Next, we focused on the cellular expression of EphB2 in the myenteric plexus of the distal colon. Combining confocal imaging with dual labeling with PGP9.5, which stains neuronal soma, processes and interganglionic nerve fiber strands (not shown) or βIII-tubulin (Tuj1) (Fig. 1F), which stains neuronal processes, showed a strong localization with neurons, particularly within processes. Further, we observed that in addition to the strong colocalization with Tuj1, a subset of EphB2 resembles/colocalizes with the neuronal cell body marker HuC/D (Fig. 1G). In contrast, no localization of EphB2 was observed in enteric glial cells (EGCs) as shown by costainings with the glial marker GFAP (Fig. 1H) or S100β (not shown). Interestingly, we found that Kalirin-7, a protein that has been well described as a mediator of EphB2 signaling in the brain (25Penzes P. Beeser A. Chernoff J. Schiller M.R. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Huganir R.L. Rapid induction of dendritic spine morphogenesis by trans-synaptic ephrinB-EphB receptor activation of the Rho-GEF kalirin.Neuron. 2003; 37: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 29Sommer J.E. Budreck E.C. Kalirin-7: Linking spine plasticity and behavior.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 5367-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), was absent in cell body of enteric neurons as shown by colabeling with antibody against HuC/D (Fig. S1A). However, we observed that Kalirin-7 was present in neuronal processes as shown by Tuj1 stainings (Fig. S1B). This is confirmed by PGP9.5 stainings (Fig. S1C). Furthermore, Kalirin-7 was strongly expressed in EGCs as highlighted by a significant and strong colocalization with GFAP (Fig. S1D) or S100β (Fig. S1E). Taken together, these results demonstrate that EphB2 is expressed by myenteric neurons in the soma and processes of enteric neurons, while Kalirin-7 is mainly found in EGCs and to some extent in neuronal processes. EphB2 signaling has been well characterized in primary hippocampal and cortical neurons (20Cisse M. Checler F. Eph receptors: New players in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.Neurobiol. Dis. 2015; 73: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but much less in enteric neurons. Thus, we aimed to dissect EphB2 signaling in enteric neurons. To pursue this objective, we first examined whether primary cultures of enteric neurons (32Chevalier J. Derkinderen P. Gomes P. Thinard R. Naveilhan P. Vanden Berghe P. Neunlist M. Activity-dependent regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the enteric nervous system.J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 1963-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33Le Berre-Scoul C.

We observed that EphB2 staining patterns are similar to that in colonic tissues. Indeed, EphB2 is mostly found in enteric neuronal processes, but not in EGCs, as shown by dual labeling with Tuj1 (Fig. 2A) and S100β (Fig. 2B) antibodies, respectively. We next used this neuronal model to dissect EphB2 signaling. First, we examined whether molecular mediators that have been associated to EphB2 in primary neuronal cultures from the CNS are expressed by enteric neurons as well. Interestingly, western blot analysis demonstrated that Kalirin-7 (25Penzes P. Beeser A. Chernoff J. Schiller M.R. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Huganir R.L.

Autoantibodies to synapsin I sequestrate synapsin I and alter synaptic function.Cell Death Dis. 2019; 10: 864Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) were expressed in ENS cultures (Fig. 3A). Next, we sought to determine whether EphB2 is active in this culture model. We used a recombinant form of the ephrinB2, a natural ligand to EphB2, fused to a fragment crystalizable (Fc) moiety that can be clustered with an anti-Fc antibody to form a bioactive ephrinB2 multimer referred to as ephrinB2-Fc. Preclustered ephrinB2-Fc ligands can be used to trigger a variety of cellular responses depending on the experimental paradigm (40Moeller M.L. Shi Y. Reichardt L.F. Ethell I.M. EphB receptors regulate dendritic spine morphogenesis through the recruitment/phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and RhoA activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). First, we examined the time-dependent capacity of ephrinB2 to activate EphB2 in primary enteric neurons. Neurons were treated with clustered ephrinB2-Fc ligand or control-Fc fragment for 5 min to 3 h at a concentration of 2 μg/ml. We found that EphB2 is activated/phosphorylated and downregulated between 30 and 45 min interval (Fig. 3, B–D). However, while total ERK1/2 levels were unchanged, we observed a phosphorylation of ERK1/2 as early as 5 min treatment of neurons with ephrinB2 (Fig. 3, B, E, and F). Interestingly, synapsin I levels were also reduced by 30 min with EphB2 activation (Fig. 3, B and G). These results suggest that ephrinB2 has a time-dependent effect on EphB2 and its downstream mediators in enteric neurons. Next, we conducted an ephrinB2 dose response. Neurons were treated for 30 min with indicated ephrinB2 concentrations. We observed no effect on EphB2 levels (Fig. 3, H and I). However, we observed changes in ERK1/2, phosphorylated ERK1/2, and synapsin I that are dependent of ephrinB2 dose (Fig. 3, H–L). Taken together, this data suggests that ephrinB2 activates EphB2 in enteric neurons with subsequent time- and dose-dependent changes on downstream mediators. Next, we examined the impact of EphB2 activation on the connectivity of enteric neurons. To this end, we chronically exposed enteric neurons to clustered ephrinB2 or control for 2 to 5 consecutive days. Similar to an acute activation, we observed a sustained decrease in levels of total EphB2 with a concomitant loss of pERK1/2 (Fig. 4, A and C). To assess the impact on neuronal connectivity, we evaluated levels of various SAPs such as synapsin I and synaptophysin, which are abundantly present in presynaptic neuronal vesicles, and PSD95, the major scaffolding protein in the excitatory postsynaptic density. We observed that ephrinB2-induced depletion of EphB2 was accompanied with a significant decrease of synaptophysin (Fig. 4, A and D), PSD95 (Fig. 4, A and E), and to a lesser extent synapsin I (Fig. 4, A and F). In contrast, total ERK1/2 (Fig. 4, A and G) and total Rac1 (Fig. 4A) were unaffected. Correlation analysis by densitometry revealed that levels of synaptophysin (Fig. 4H), but not PSD95 (Fig. 4I), or pERK1/2 (Fig. 4J), were linearly correlated with EphB2 levels. To further explore whether EphB2 activation affects neuronal connectivity, we exposed primary cultures of enteric neurons to ephrinB2 or control fragment for 5 consecutive days. First, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis to visualize synapses with antibodies that label synapse-specific components in pre- and/or postsynaptic compartments (41Verstraelen P. Van Dyck M. Verschuuren M. Kashikar N.D. Nuydens R. Timmermans J.P. De Vos W.H. Image-based profiling of synaptic connectivity in primary neuronal cell culture.Front. Neurosci. 2018; 12: 389Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We found that exposure to ephrinB2 reduced EphB2 (Fig. 5, A and E), with no change in overall neuronal density as assessed by staining of neurons with anti-HuC/D antibody (Fig. 5, A and D). Furthermore, we found that exposure to ephrinB2, but not control fragment, reduced the expression of synapsin I (Fig. 5, B and F) and synaptophysin (Fig. 5, C and G). Next, we examined whether ephrinB2-dependent activation of EphB2 affects overall neuronal process morphology through Tuj-1 staining. We found no morphological difference in neurite growth and number in ephrinB2-treated relative to control condition as assessed by Tuj1 staining (Fig. 5, H–J). This suggests that depletion of EphB2, synapsin I, PSD95, or synaptophysin following treatment of neurons with ephrinB2 is more likely due to ephrinB2-specific effect on EphB2 and downstream regulatory mechanisms rather than a broader effect reducing overall neuronal process number, growth, and SAPs. To examine whether chronic changes in neuronal connectivity markers induced by chronic exposure (5 days) to ephrinB2 translate into changes in electrophysiological properties of primary culture of enteric neurons, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings by using a KCl-based intracellular solution. We observed no difference in active and passive membrane properties in ephrinB2 relative to control-treated neurons (Table 1 and Fig. 6, A and B). Next, we used a Cs-based intracellular solution to measure miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs). Interestingly, we observed that neurons exposed to ephrinB2 exhibited a 3-fold reduction of mPSC frequency relative to control condition (i.e., neurons exposed to control-Fc fragment) (Fig. 6, C and D). However, neurons exposed to ephrinB2 displayed normal amplitude (Fig. 6E), rise time (Fig. 6F), and decay time (Fig. 6G). These results further suggest that EphB2 regulates neuronal connectivity/activity.Table 1Summary of passive and active membrane properties of enteric neurons recorded in current-clamp configuration using a KCl-based intracellular solutionAction potentialNo. of cellsVrest, mVRin, MohmRheobase, pAAmplitude, mVRise time, msDecay time, msHalf-width, msControl16/8−38.2 ± 21615 ± 23828.8 ± 3.952.2 ± 2.94 ± 0.36.2 ± 1.14.9 ± 0.6ephrinB216/8−37.6 ± 1.41602 ± 21725.4 ± 4.457 ± 3.53.4 ± 0.35.4 ± 0.84.3 ± 0.6 Open table in a new tab This study provides evidence that EphB2 receptor regulates enteric neuronal connectivity and identifies underlying molecular mechanisms. We show that EphB2 is expressed by myenteric neurons across intestinal segments of the rat. EphrinB2-dependent activation of EphB2 engages ERK1/2 signaling pathway in ENS primary cultures. Overtime, this leads to a downregulation of EphB2 signaling with a subsequent depletion of synaptic proteins. Furthermore, long-term activation of EphB2 significantly reduced mPSPs of enteric neurons without affecting action potentials or resting membrane properties. The broad expression of EphB2 in the gut suggests that it has an important role in the small and large intestines. However, we observed that expression of EphB2 mRNA is not consistent with that of its protein, probably due to posttranscriptional regulations that affect the mRNAs before translated into protein (42Vogel C.

In addition, the present study showed EphB2 expression in neuronal processes and to a lesser extent in cell body within the myenteric plexus. Although EphB2 could not be detected in enteric glial cells by immunostainings, we cannot rule out the possibility that it is expressed by these cell types (44Holmberg J. Genander M. Halford M.M.

It is critical to understand the geographical heterogeneity of Sudan and patterns in the inequality of access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Through such research, the disease control strategy can be optimized, and resource allocation can be prioritized. We explored spatial heterogeneity and inequality in access to improved water and sanitation across Sudan by mapping the coverage at both the state and district levels. We decomposed the inequality across Sudan into within-state, between-state, within-district, and between-state inequalities using the Theil L and Theil T indices. We calculated the Gini coefficient to assess the inequality of access to improved water and sanitation, based on the deviation of the Lorenz curve from the line of perfect equality. The study population was 105,167 students aged 8-13 at 1,776 primary schools across the country. Geographical heterogeneity was prominent in the Central Darfur, South Darfur, East Darfur, Kassala, West Kordofan, and Blue Nile States, all of which showed severe inequality in access to an improved latrine at the household level in terms of the Theil T or Theil L index. The overall inequality in the coverage of improved sanitation went beyond the warning limit of 0.4 for the Gini coefficient. The inequality in terms of the Theil L and Theil T indices, as well as the Gini coefficient, was always higher for improved sanitation than for improved water at the household level. Within-state inequality accounted for 66% or more of national inequalities in the distribution of improved sanitation and drinking water for both the Theil L and Theil T indices. This is the first study to measure geographical heterogeneity and inequalities in improved water and sanitation coverage across Sudan. The study may help to prioritize resource allocation to areas with the greatest water and sanitation needs."

In this exploratory proof of concept study, our objective was to determine the prevalence of humoral immunodeficiency in patients with CLL and serum IgG ≥ 400 mg/dL, and to evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) in this population.Patients with CLL with serum IgG ≥ 400 mg/dL were evaluated for serum IgG, IgM, IgA, along with pre/post vaccine IgG titers to diphtheria, tetanus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Patients with evidence of humoral dysfunction were treated with SCIG with Hizentra every 7±2 days for 24 weeks.Fifteen patients enrolled with median IgG = 782 mg/dL [IQR: 570 to 827], and 6/15 (40%) responded to vaccination with Td, while 5/15 (33%) responded to vaccination with PPV23. 14/15 (93.3%) demonstrated humoral immunodeficiency as evidenced by suboptimal vaccine responses, and were treated with SCIG. In patients treated with SCIG, serum IgG increased from 670 mg/dL [IQR: 565 to 819] to 1054 mg/dL [IQR: 1040 to 1166] after 24 weeks (95% CI: 271-540). For streptococcus pneumoniae, the median protective serotypes at baseline was 8 [IQR: 4 to 9] and increased to 17 [IQR: 17 to 19] after 24 weeks (95% CI: 6.93-13.72). Non-neutropenic infections (NNI) decreased from 14 to 5 during treatment with SCIG.Patients with CLL demonstrate humoral immunodeficiency despite IgG > 400 mg/dL. For these patients, SCIG is well tolerated and efficacious in improving serum IgG, specific IgG to streptococcus pneumoniae, and may decrease reliance on antibiotics for the treatment of NNIs.NCT03730129."
https://openalex.org/W3205477437,"Fungal diseases in agronomically important plants such as grapevines result in significantly reduced production, pecuniary losses, and increased use of environmentally damaging chemicals. Beside the well-known diseases, there is an increased interest in wood-colonizing fungal pathogens that infect the woody tissues of grapevines. In 2015, a traditional isolation method was performed on grapevine trunks showing symptoms of trunk diseases in Hungary. One isolate (T15142) was identified as Kalmusia longispora (formerly Dendrothyrium longisporum) according to morphological and phylogenetic analyses. To evaluate the pathogenicity of this fungus on grapevines, artificial infections were carried out under greenhouse and field conditions, including the CBS 824.84 and ex-type CBS 582.83 strains. All isolates could be re-isolated from inoculated plants; however, varying virulence was observed among them in terms of the vascular necrosis caused. The incidence and severity of this symptom seemed to be congruent with the laccase-producing capabilities of the isolates. This is the first report on the ability of Kalmusia longispora to cause symptoms on grapevines, and on its possible dependence on laccase secretion."
https://openalex.org/W3205863556,"Giant clams live in symbiosis with phototrophic dinoflagellates, which reside extracellularly inside zooxanthellal tubules located mainly in the colourful and extensible outer mantle. As symbiotic dinoflagellates have no access to the ambient seawater, they need to obtain inorganic carbon (Ci) from the host for photosynthesis during illumination. The outer mantle has a host-mediated and light-dependent carbon-concentrating mechanism to augment the supply of Ci to the symbionts during illumination. Iridocytes can increase the secretion of H+ through vacuolar H+-ATPase to dehydrate HCO3- present in the hemolymph to CO2. CO2 can permeate the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells of the zooxanthellal tubules, and rehydrated back to HCO3- in the cytoplasm catalysed by carbonic anhydrase 2. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism involved in the transport of HCO3- across the apical membrane of these epithelial cells into the luminal fluid surrounding the symbionts. We had obtained the complete cDNA coding sequence of a homolog of electrogenic Na+-HCO3- cotransporter 2 (NBCe2-like gene) from the outer mantle of the fluted giant clam, Tridacna squamosa. NBCe2-like gene comprised 3,399 bp, encoding a protein of 1,132 amino acids of 127.3 kDa. NBCe2-like protein had an apical localization in the epithelial cells of zooxanthellal tubules, denoting that it could transport HCO3- between the epithelial cells and the luminal fluid. Furthermore, illumination augmented the transcript level and protein abundance of NBCe2-like gene/NBCe2-like protein in the outer mantle, indicating that it could mediate the increased transport of HCO3- into the luminal fluid to support photosynthesis in the symbionts."

The association of vitamin D and other metabolic risk factors (triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and insulin resistance using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)) with CIMT was explored by multivariable linear regression models.Out of 156 obese adolescents, 55.8% were boys. Compared to girls, boys had higher BMI z-score, waist circumference, and HDL-cholesterol. After adjustment for age, sex and second-hand smoke exposure, high HOMA-IR, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels were associated with higher odds of elevated CIMT. In analyses stratified by sex, a similar trend was observed in boys, while none of the risk factors were associated with CIMT in girls. We observed no association between vitamin D and CIMT.Hyperinsulinemia, higher total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were associated with greater odds of elevated CIMT among obese adolescent boys."

Important problems associated with this method have been addressed and various alternatives that overcome these problems have been developed. Despite its many well-documented drawbacks, NHST remains the prevailing method for drawing conclusions from data. Reasons for this have been insufficiently investigated. Therefore, the aim of our study was to explore the perceived barriers and facilitators related to the use of NHST and alternative statistical procedures among relevant stakeholders in the scientific system.Individual semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with junior and senior researchers, lecturers in statistics, editors of scientific journals and program leaders of funding agencies. During the focus groups, important themes that emerged from the interviews were discussed. Data analysis was performed using the constant comparison method, allowing emerging (sub)themes to be fully explored. A theory substantiating the prevailing use of NHST was developed based on the main themes and subthemes we identified.Twenty-nine interviews and six focus groups were conducted. Several interrelated facilitators and barriers associated with the use of NHST and alternative statistical procedures were identified. These factors were subsumed under three main themes: the scientific climate, scientific duty, and reactivity. As a result of the factors, most participants feel dependent in their actions upon others, have become reactive, and await action and initiatives from others. This may explain why NHST is still the standard and ubiquitously used by almost everyone involved.Our findings demonstrate how perceived barriers to shift away from NHST set a high threshold for actual behavioral change and create a circle of interdependency between stakeholders. By taking small steps it should be possible to decrease the scientific community's strong dependence on NHST and p-values."
https://openalex.org/W3206914273,"Factors and mechanisms promoting resource-based radiation in animals still represent a main challenge to evolutionary biology. The modifications of phenotype tied with adaptive diversification may result from an environmentally related shift having occurred at the early stage of development. Here, we study the role of temperature dynamics on the reproductive sites in the early-life divergence and adaptive radiation of the salmonid fish Salvelinus malma dwelling in the Lake Kronotskoe basin (North-East Asia). Local sympatric charr ecomorphs demonstrate strict homing behaviour guiding the preordained distribution along tributaries and, hence, further development under different temperatures. We thoroughly assessed the annual temperature dynamics at the spawning grounds of each morph as compared to an ancestral anadromous morph. Then we carried out an experimental rearing of both under naturally diverging and uniformed temperatures. To compare the morphs' development under the dynamically changing temperatures, we have designed a method based on calculating the accumulated heat by the Arrhenius equation. The proposed equation shows a strong predictive power and, at the same time, is not bias-susceptible when the developmental temperature approximates 0°C. The temperature was found to significantly affect the charrs' early ontogeny, which underlies the divergence of developmental and growth rates between the morphs, as well as morph-specific ontogenetic adaptations to the spawning site's temperatures. As opposed to the endemic morphs from Lake Kronotskoe, the anadromous S. malma, being unexposed to selection оn highly specific reproduction conditions, showed a wide temperature tolerance, Our findings demonstrate that the hatch, onset timing of external feeding, and size dissimilarities between the sympatric morphs reveal themselves during the development under contrast temperatures. As a result of the observed developmental disparities, the morphs occupy specific definitive foraging niches in the lake."

In the present context of global change, estimating time-budget for these species is relevant to assess and predict their capacity to adapt to near future. We tested the hypothesis that in ectotherms where reproduction is highly energy consuming, energy expenditure should vary throughout the breeding season with a maximum around nesting events. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the fine-scale behaviour, time-budget and estimated energetic costs in eight adult female European pond turtles Emys orbicularis equipped with data-loggers recording ambient temperature, pressure, light and the animals' 3-axis acceleration. Deployments occurred over four months throughout the nesting season 2017 in semi-natural captive conditions in Alsace, France. All study turtles showed a clear daily pattern over the 24h cycle, with four distinct phases (referred to as Night, Morning, Midday and Evening), associated with different behaviours and activity levels. Before oviposition, turtles were mostly active during Morning, and activity was positively driven by ambient temperature. Activity levels doubled during the nesting period, mostly due to the increased activity in the Evening, when nesting events occurred. Throughout the active season, basking occurrence at Midday was related to air temperature but cloud coverage was an even more important factor. Our results are a first step in predicting the seasonal time and energy budgets of the European pond turtle, and demonstrate the usefulness of animal-borne accelerometers to study free living freshwater turtles over extended periods of time."
https://openalex.org/W3205158486,"Chemokines play diverse and fundamental roles in the immune system and human disease, which has prompted their structural and functional characterisation. Production of recombinant chemokines that are folded and bioactive is vital to their study but is limited by the stringent requirements of a native N-terminus for receptor activation and correct disulphide bonding required to stabilise the chemokine fold. Even when expressed as fusion proteins, overexpression of chemokines in E. coli tends to result in the formation of inclusion bodies, generating the additional steps of solubilisation and refolding. Here we present a novel method for producing soluble chemokines in relatively large amounts via a simple two-step purification procedure with no requirements for refolding. CXCL8 produced by this method has the correct chemokine fold as determined by NMR spectroscopy and in chemotaxis assays was indistinguishable from commercially available chemokines. We believe that this protocol significantly streamlines the generation of recombinant chemokines."

In order to ultimately realize the goal of therapeutic MYC inhibition in cancer, we have initiated discovery chemistry efforts aimed at inhibiting MYC translation. Here we describe a series of conformationally stabilized synthetic antisense oligonucleotides designed to target MYC mRNA (MYCASOs). To support bioactivity, we designed and synthesized this focused library of MYCASOs incorporating locked nucleic acid (LNA) bases at the 5ʹ- and 3ʹ-ends, a phosphorothioate backbone, and internal DNA bases. Treatment of MYC-expressing cancer cells with MYCASOs leads to a potent decrease in MYC mRNA and protein levels. Cleaved MYC mRNA in MYCASO-treated cells is detected with a sensitive 5ʹ Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) assay. MYCASO treatment of cancer cell lines leads to significant inhibition of cellular proliferation while specifically perturbing MYC-driven gene expression signatures. In a MYC-induced model of hepatocellular carcinoma, MYCASO treatment decreases MYC protein levels within tumors, decreases tumor burden, and improves overall survival.

In this multicentric prospective cohort study. we selected all patients who remained on a PD modality for at least 6 months and switched PD modality. Patients were also required to be treated with the same PD modality for at least 3 months before and after the modality change. The primary outcome was change in potassium and phosphate serum levels. We identified 737 eligible patients who switched their PD modality during the study. We found mean serum phosphate levels increased during the 3 months after switching from CAPD to APD and conversely decreased after switching to from APD to CAPD. In contrast, for potassium the difference in the mean serum levels was comparable between groups switching from CAPD to APD, and vice versa. In conclusion, CAPD seems to be as efficient as APD for the control of potassium serum levels, but more effective for the control of phosphate serum levels. The effect of a higher removal of middle size molecules as result of PD modalities in terms of clinical and patient-reported outcomes should be further explored."

The Priapism Impact Profile (PIP) is a novel 12-item instrument designed to measure general health-related impact of priapism. The aim of the study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the PIP in a Jamaican cohort of SCD patients experiencing priapism. Methods One hundred SCD patients with a history of priapism were recruited from a sickle cell clinic in Kingston, Jamaica and administered the PIP questionnaire. Patients rated each item of the PIP for clarity and importance. Statistical testing was employed to evaluate the psychometric performance of the PIP. Content validation was assessed based on patient descriptive rating of the items based on clarity, and importance and criterion-oriented validity were assessed by evaluating the PIP’s ability to distinguish between patient subgroups. Test-retest repeatability was assessed in 20 of the 100 patients. Results Patients were stratified into active (54) and remission (46) priapism groups based on their experience of priapism within the past year. Patients in the active priapism group were younger (p = 0.011), had a shorter duration of disease (p = 0.023), and had more frequent priapism episodes (p = 0.036) than the remission group. PIP questionnaire scores differed significantly with respect to priapism activity (p &lt; 0.001) and prevalence of erectile dysfunction (p &lt; 0.05) but not by priapism severity (p = 0.62). The PIP questionnaire had good content validity, with questions rated as having medium or high clarity and importance by an average of 82.8% and 69.2% of patients, respectively. Conclusion The PIP questionnaire was successfully validated in a Jamaican cohort of SCD patients and adequately discriminated patients with active priapism from those in remission. The instrument may be utilized in routine clinical management of patients with SCD-associated priapism. Further clinical investigations are warranted in other populations."
https://openalex.org/W3207393808,"Due to the characteristics of high strength, high chemical activity and low heat conduction, titanium alloy materials are generally difficult to machine. As a typical titanium alloy with higher strength and lower heat conductivity, the machinability of titanium alloy TC21 is very poor and its cutting process is companied with larger cutting force and rapid tool wear. Straight-tooth milling tool is often used to cut the groove and side surface in the titanium alloy parts. And the milling method can be used to investigate the cutting mechanism because the cutting force has only two components and the better chip morphology is obtained. To investigate the straight-tooth milling process of TC21 alloy, a series of milling force experiments have been done. In addition, a 3D finite element model (FEM) for the straight-tooth milling process of TC21 alloy is presented to simulate the milling process. In the model, the constitutive material model, the failure model, the friction model and the heat transfer model were adopted. Through the simulation, chip formation, stress distribution, cutting force and milling temperature were obtained. The cutting force reaches its maximum when the spindle speed reaches about 13000 rpm, and then decreases as the speed continues to increase. The results confirmed that the similar ""Salomon"" phenomenon existed in the cutting process of TC21 alloy."

Dead end was shown to be expressed in human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), PGCs and spermatogonia, but little is known about its specific role concerning pluripotency and human germline development. Here we use CRISPR/Cas mediated knockout and PGC-like cell (PGCLC) differentiation in human iPSCs to determine if DND1 (1) plays a role in maintaining pluripotency and (2) in specification of PGCLCs. We generated several clonal lines carrying biallelic loss of function mutations and analysed their differentiation potential towards PGCLCs and their gene expression on RNA and protein levels via RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry. The generated knockout iPSCs showed no differences in pluripotency gene expression, proliferation, or trilineage differentiation potential, but yielded reduced numbers of PGCLCs as compared with their parental iPSCs. RNAseq analysis of mutated PGCLCs revealed that the overall gene expression remains like non-mutated PGCLCs. However, reduced expression of genes associated with PGC differentiation and maintenance (e.g., NANOS3, PRDM1) was observed. Together, we show that DND1 iPSCs maintain their pluripotency but exhibit a reduced differentiation to PGCLCs. This versatile model will allow further analysis of the specific mechanisms by which DND1 influences PGC differentiation and maintenance."

However, controversy surrounds which of the three extant CCDD tetraploid species-A. insularis, A. magna and A. murphyi-is most closely related to hexaploid oats. The present work describes a comparative karyotype analysis of these three CCDD tetraploid species and two hexaploid species, A. sativa and A. byzantina. This involved the use of FISH with six simple sequence repeats (SSRs) with the motifs CT, AAC, AAG, ACG, ATC and ACT, two repeated ribosomal sequences, and C genome-specific repetitive DNA. The hybridization pattern of A. insularis with oligonucleotide (AC)10 was also determined and compared with those previously published for A. sativa and A. byzantina. Significant differences in the 5S sites and SSR hybridization patterns of A. murphyi compared to the other CCDD species rule out its being directly involved in the origin of the hexaploids. In contrast, the repetitive and SSR hybridization patterns shown by the D genome chromosomes, and by most of the C genome chromosomes of A. magna and A. insularis, can be equated with the corresponding chromosomes of the hexaploids. Several chromosome hybridization signals seen for A. insularis, but not for A. magna, were shared with the hexaploid oats species, especially with A. byzantina. These diagnostic signals add weight to the idea that the extant A. insularis, or a direct ancestor of it, is the most closely related progenitor of hexaploid oats. The similarity of the chromosome hybridization patterns of the hexaploids and CCDD tetraploids was taken as being indicative of homology. A common chromosome nomenclature for CCDD species based on that of the hexaploid species is proposed."

All of the 20 association loci detected for grain yield (GY), plant height (PH), ear height (EH) and GCA for the three traits in two places could explain a phenotypic variation range of 7.31%-9.29%. Among the 20 association loci, 9 (7.31%-9.04%) were associated with GY, 4 (7.22%-8.91%) were related to GCA of GY, 1 (7.56%) was associated with PH, and 3 (7.53%-8.96%) were related to EH. In addition, 3 loci (9.14%-9.29%) were associated with GCA of PH whereas no locus was identified for GCA of EH. In the comparison of the association loci detected in Baoding and Handan, interestingly, one locus (7.69% and 8.11%) was identified in both environments and one locus (7.52% and 7.82%) was identified for yield and GCA of yield. Therefore, the identification of GY-, PH-, EH- and GCA-related association loci could not only provide references for high yield breeding of maize, but also help us comprehend the relationships among GY, agricultural traits and GCA."
https://openalex.org/W3206447439,"This study introduces a methodology for inferring the weight of the evidence (WoE) in the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-typed DNA mixtures of forensic interest. First, we redefined some algebraic formulae to approach the semi-continuous calculation of likelihoods and likelihood ratios (LRs). To address the allelic dropouts, a peak height ratio index (“h,” an index of heterozygous state plausibility) was incorporated into semi-continuous formulae to act as a proxy for the “split-drop” model of calculation. Second, the original ratio at which a person of interest (POI) has entered into the mixture was inferred by evaluating the DNA amounts conferred by unique genotypes to any possible permutation of any locus of the typing protocol (unique genotypes are genotypes that appear just once in the relevant permutation). We compared this expected ratio (MR ex ) to all the mixing ratios emerging at all other permutations of the mixture (MR obs ) using several (1 - χ 2 ) tests to evaluate the probability of each permutation to exist in the mixture according to quantitative criteria. At the level of each permutation state, we multiplied the (1 - χ 2 ) value to the genotype frequencies and the h index. All the products of all the permutation states were finally summed to give a likelihood value that accounts for three independent properties of the mixtures. Owing to the (1 - χ 2 ) index and the h index, this approach qualifies as a fully continuous methodology of LR calculation. We compared the MRs and LRs emerging from our methodology to those generated by the EuroForMix software ver. 3.0.3. When the true contributors were tested as POIs, our procedure generated highly discriminant LRs that, unlike EuroForMix, never overcame the corresponding single-source LRs. When false contributors were tested as POIs, we obtained a much lower LR value than that from EuroForMix. These two findings indicate that our computational method is more reliable and realistic than EuroForMix."
https://openalex.org/W3207552273,"Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NT Hi ) is a significant pathogen in respiratory disease and otitis media. Important for NT Hi survival, colonization and persistence in vivo is the Sap ( s ensitivity to a ntimicrobial p eptides) ABC transporter system. Current models propose a direct role for Sap in heme and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) transport. Here, the crystal structure of SapA, the periplasmic component of Sap, in a closed, ligand bound conformation, is presented. Phylogenetic and cavity volume analysis predicts that the small, hydrophobic SapA central ligand binding cavity is most likely occupied by a hydrophobic di- or tri- peptide. The cavity is of insufficient volume to accommodate heme or folded AMPs. Crystal structures of SapA have identified surface interactions with heme and dsRNA. Heme binds SapA weakly (K d 282 μM) through a surface exposed histidine, while the dsRNA is coordinated via residues which constitute part of a conserved motif (estimated K d 4.4 μM). The RNA affinity falls within the range observed for characterized RNA/protein complexes. Overall, we describe in molecular-detail the interactions of SapA with heme and dsRNA and propose a role for SapA in the transport of di- or tri-peptides."
https://openalex.org/W3207673058,"Molecular steps that activate store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) via Orai channel supramolecular complex remain incompletely defined. We have earlier shown that α-SNAP regulates the on-site functional assembly and calcium selectivity of Orai1 channels. Here we investigate the molecular basis of its association with Orai, Stim and find that the affinity of α-SNAP for Orai and Stim is substantially higher than previously reported affinities between Stim and Orai sub-domains. α-SNAP binds the coiled-coil 3 (CC3) sub-domain of Stim1. Mutations of Tryptophan 430 in Stim1-CC3 disrupted α-SNAP association and SOCE, demonstrating a novel α-SNAP dependent function for this crucial subdomain. Further, α-SNAP binds the hinge region near the C-terminus of Orai1 and an additional broad region near the N-terminus and Valine 262 and Leucine 74 were necessary for these respective interactions, but not Orai, Stim co-clustering. Thus, high affinity interactions with α-SNAP are necessary for imparting functionality to Stim, Orai clusters and induction of SOCE."
https://openalex.org/W3205891888,"Although the inter-arm blood pressure (BP) difference has been advocated to be associated with cardiovascular events, the implication of inter-leg BP difference has not been well established. This study was conducted to investigate whether inter-arm and -leg BP differences have prognostic value in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).In this prospective study, we consecutively enrolled 667 patients who underwent PCI. Both arm and leg BPs were measured at the day after PCI. The primary outcome was a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) including cardiac death, acute coronary syndrome, coronary revascularization, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure during the follow-up period.Mean age was 64.0±11.1 years old, and males were predominant (70.5%). During a mean follow-up period of 3.0 years, MACE occurred in 209 (31.3%) patients. The inter-leg systolic BP difference (ILSBPD) was significantly higher in patients with MACE than those without (9.9±12.3 vs. 7.2±7.5 mmHg, P = 0.004). The inter-arm systolic BP difference was not significantly different between patients with and without MACE (P = 0.403). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, increased ILSBPD was independently associated with the development of MACE (per 5 mmHg; hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.14). The inter-arm systolic BP difference was not associated with MACE in the multivariable analysis.Increased ILSBPD was independently associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes after PCI. As ILSBPD is easy to measure, it may be helpful in the risk stratification of patients undergoing PCI."
https://openalex.org/W3205915578,"Introduction Female adolescents living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus are a unique population facing lifelong challenges in reproductive and sexual health ranging from relational, social and legal-ethical considerations. While HIV prevalence of young females is higher than the males (4.9% versus 1%), evidence show that these adolescents in Malawi initiate sex as early as 15 years mostly with adult partners. Yet, young people are frequently reported to be reluctant to discuss sexual matters and demonstrate avoidance of direct questions on sexual issues during interviews. It is critical therefore that researchers invoke youth-friendly approaches to address these complex issues and enable these vulnerable individuals to articulate and advocate for their preferred futures. Methods This study used an innovative visual qualitative approach known as ‘my story’ book which combined image selection and sentence completion exercises to enable adolescents living with HIV to share their stories through interviews. The study involved 14 cases comprising of 14 female adolescents aged 15 to 19, 14 caregivers and 14 health providers working at HIV multidisciplinary centres in Malawi. Results The ‘my story’ book enabled in-depth exploration of the experiences and issues faced by this vulnerable population. The use of images and sentence completion exercise enabled the researcher to appreciate the type of interactions (or lack of) on sexual issues and status disclosure to significant others including sexual partners. Three themes were revealed, included creating meanings, revealing confirmatory and/or complementary evidence and enabling intergenerational research. Conclusions The ‘my story’ book captured the life experiences and needs of the female adolescents. The book assisted the participants in constructing, communicating, and controlling the articulation of their stories. It positioned female adolescents as a diverse group of social agents able to construct and reflect on their social worlds and real-life issues. This approach was highly effective in creating a youth-friendly context for reflection and revelation regarding sensitive cultural and social issues faced by this group. As such, the ‘my story’ book could be used in one-on-one counselling or provide data to inform intervention development."
https://openalex.org/W3207074110,"In mammals, the photopigment melanopsin (Opn4) is found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells that serve light detection for circadian photoentrainment and pupil constriction (i.e., mydriasis). For a given species, the efficiency of photoentrainment and length of time that mydriasis occurs is determined by the spectral sensitivity and deactivation kinetics of melanopsin, respectively, and to date, neither of these properties have been described in marine mammals. Previous work has indicated that the absorbance maxima (λ max ) of marine mammal rhodopsins (Rh1) have diversified to match the available light spectra at foraging depths. However, similar to the melanopsin λ max of terrestrial mammals (~480 nm), the melanopsins of marine mammals may be conserved, with λ max values tuned to the spectrum of solar irradiance at the water’s surface. Here, we investigated the Opn4 pigments of 17 marine mammal species inhabiting diverse photic environments including the Infraorder Cetacea, as well as the Orders Sirenia and Carnivora. Both genomic and cDNA sequences were used to deduce amino acid sequences to identify substitutions most likely involved in spectral tuning and deactivation kinetics of the Opn4 pigments. Our results show that there appears to be no amino acid substitutions in marine mammal Opn4 opsins that would result in any significant change in λ max values relative to their terrestrial counterparts. We also found some marine mammal species to lack several phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl terminal domain of their Opn4 pigments that result in significantly slower deactivation kinetics, and thus longer mydriasis, compared to terrestrial controls. This finding was restricted to cetacean species previously found to lack cone photoreceptor opsins, a condition known as rod monochromacy. These results suggest that the rod monochromat whales rely on extended pupillary constriction to prevent photobleaching of the highly photosensitive all-rod retina when moving between photopic and scotopic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3207102025,"Background Respiratory Tract Infections (RTIs) and Gastro-Intestinal (GI) infections are the leading causes of child mortality and morbidity. This study investigates the associations between the individual, household and slum-level determinants of children’s health and vulnerability to RTIs and GI infections in peri-urban slums in India; an area of research interest at the Childhood Infections and Pollution Consortium. Methods The 2015–16 Indian National Family Health Survey was used for data analysis on children aged 0–5 years. NFHS-4 includes data on slums in eight Indian cities, including Delhi, Meerut, Kolkata, Indore, Mumbai, Nagpur, Hyderabad, Chennai. The outcome variables, having fever and cough (FeCo) and diarrhoea in the last two weeks, were used to define the phenotype of infections; for this analysis fever and cough were measures of RTIs and diarrhoea was used to measure GI infections. Exposures considered in this study include variables at the individual, household and slum level and were all informed by existing literature. Multilevel models were used to estimate the association between exposures and outcomes variables; a prior of Cauchy distribution with a scale of 2.5 was selected when building the multilevel logistic models. Results The total sample size of the number of children included in the analysis was n = 1 , 424 . Data was imputed to account for missingness, and the original and imputed sample showing similar distributions. Results showed that diarrhoea and FeCo were both found to be more present in younger children than older children by a few months. In fixed effects, the odds of developing FeCo were higher if the mother perceives the child was born smaller than average (AOR 4.41, 1.13–17.17, P&lt;0.05) at individual level. On the other hand, the odds of the diarrhoea outcome were lower if the child was older (AOR 0.97, 0.96–0.98, P&lt;0.05) at individual level, and household’s water source was public tap or standpipe (AOR 0.54, 0.31–0.96, P&lt;0.05) at household level. Conclusion The determinants of health, both social and related to health care, at all levels demonstrated linkages to child morbidity in RTIs and GI infections. The empirical evidence highlights the need for contextualised ideas at each level, including one health approach when designing interventions to improve child health."
