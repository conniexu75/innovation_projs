https://openalex.org/W1537398036,"Recent studies suggest that statins can function to protect the vasculature in a manner that is independent of their lipid-lowering activity. We show here that statins rapidly activate the protein kinase Akt/PKB in endothelial cells. Accordingly, simvastatin enhanced phosphorylation of the endogenous Akt substrate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), inhibited apoptosis and accelerated vascular structure formation in vitro in an Akt-dependent manner. Similar to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment, both simvastatin administration and enhanced Akt signaling in the endothelium promoted angiogenesis in ischemic limbs of normocholesterolemic rabbits. Therefore, activation of Akt represents a mechanism that can account for some of the beneficial side effects of statins, including the promotion of new blood vessel growth."

Decreasing numbers of TRECs have been observed with aging and in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infected individuals, suggesting thymic impairment. Here, we show that in healthy individuals, declining thymic output will affect the TREC content only when accompanied by naive T-cell division. The rapid decline in TRECs observed during HIV-1 infection and the increase following HAART are better explained not by thymic impairment, but by changes in peripheral T-cell division rates. Our data indicate that TREC content in healthy individuals is only indirectly related to thymic output, and in HIV-1 infection is mainly affected by immune activation."

Effect of melatonin, NAC, ascorbate, and Trolox on mitochondrial GSH and GSSG levelsIn basal conditions, i.e., mitochondria incubated in the absence of t-BHP, melatonin (100 nM) significantly (P<0.001) increased the content of GSH and decreased that of GSSG in brain (GSH: 6.82±0.78 to 10.13±0.42 nmol/mg prot) and liver (GSH: 11.54±0.89 to 19.43±0.80 nmol/mg prot; GSSG: 1.44±0.22 to 0.06±0.007 nmol/mg prot) mitochondria. The other antioxidants tested were unable to exert a similar effect of melatonin, and only the dose of 1000 μM Trolox increased GSH levels (11.50 ± 0.43 nmol/mg prot) in brain mitochondria.After incubation with 100 μM t-BHP, practically all GSH was oxidized to GSSG (Fig. 1)⤻ . Melatonin (100 nM) counteracted these toxic effects, recovering the basal levels of GSH and GSSG. In this situation, i.e., t-BHP-induced oxid..."

https://openalex.org/W2078519703,"Current opinion assumes epithelial integrity during spontaneous apoptotic cell death. We measured, for the first time, the local conductances associated with apoptoses and show leaks of up to 280 nS (mean 48 ± 19 nS) in human intestinal epithelium. The results disprove the dogma that isolated cell apoptosis occurs without affecting the epithelial cell permeability barrier. After induction by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) the apoptotic leaks were dramatically enhanced: not only was the frequency increased by threefold, but the mean conductance also increased by 12-fold (597±98 nS). Thus, apoptosis accounted for about half (56%) of the TNF-α-induced permeability increase whereas the other half was caused by degradation of tight junctions in nonapoptotic areas. Hence, spontaneous and induced apoptosis hollow out the intestinal barrier and may facilitate loss of solutes and uptake of noxious agents.—Gitter, A. H., Bendfeldt, K., Schulzke, J.-D., Fromm, M.

https://openalex.org/W2024755684,"Two polarized patterns (Th1 and Th2) of cytokines regulate inflammatory responses. Each cytokine pattern inhibits production of the opposing pattern. Lymphocytes from inflamed intestine due to Crohn's disease secrete a Th1 pattern of cytokines. Crohn's disease is most prevalent in highly industrialized countries with temperate climates. It occurs rarely in tropical third world countries with poor sanitation. We propose that exposure to an environmental agent predisposes individuals to Crohn's disease. Parasitic worms (helminths) are common in tropical climates and in populations subject to crowding and poor sanitation. Children are most subject to helminthic colonization. Many helminths live within or migrate through the human gut where they interact with the mucosal immune system. The host mounts a mucosal response that includes Th2 cytokine production limiting helminthic colonization. Helminths and their eggs probably are the most potent stimulators of mucosal Th2 responses. The Th2 response provoked by parasitic worms can modulate immune reactions to unrelated parasitic, bacterial, and viral infections. Many people in developed countries now live in increasingly hygienic environments, avoiding exposure to helminths. Perhaps failure to acquire these parasites and experience mucosal Th2 conditioning predisposes to Crohn's disease, which is an overly active Th1 inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W2104769989,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated as mediators of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) -induced apoptosis. In addition to leading to cell death, ROS can also promote cell growth and/or survival. We investigated these two roles of ROS in TNF-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated with TNF produced an intracellular burst of ROS. Adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of a dominant negative form of the small GTPase Rac1 (Rac1N17) partially suppressed the TNF-induced oxidative burst without affecting TNF-induced mitochondrial ROS production. HUVECs were protected from TNF-induced apoptosis. Expression of Rac1N17 blocked TNF-induced activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), increased activity of caspase-3, and markedly augmented endothelial cell susceptibility to TNF-induced apoptosis. Direct inhibition of NF-kappaB through adenoviral expression of the super repressor form of inhibitor of kappaBalpha (I-kappaB S32/36A) also increased susceptibility of HUVECs to TNF-induced apoptosis. Rotenone, a mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitor, suppressed TNF-induced mitochondrial ROS production, proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-3, and apoptosis. These findings show that Rac1 is an important regulator of TNF-induced ROS production in endothelial cells. Moreover, they suggest that Rac1-dependent ROS, directly or indirectly, lead to protection against TNF-induced death, whereas mitochondrial-derived ROS promote TNF-induced apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2096816747,"In laboratory rodents, caloric restriction (CR) retards several age-dependent physiological and biochemical changes in skeletal muscle, including increased steady-state levels of oxidative damage to lipids, DNA, and proteins. We used immunogold electron microscopic (EM) techniques with antibodies raised against 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) -modified proteins, dinitrophenol, and nitrotyrosine to quantify and localize the age-dependent accrual of oxidative damage in rhesus monkey vastus lateralis skeletal muscle. Using immunogold EM analysis of muscle from rhesus monkeys ranging in age from 2 to 34 years old, a fourfold maximal increase in levels of HNE-modified proteins was observed. Likewise, carbonyl levels increased ~ twofold with aging. Comparing 17- to 23-year-old normally fed to age-matched monkeys subjected to CR for 10 years, levels of HNE-modified proteins, carbonyls, and nitrotyrosine in skeletal muscle from the CR group were significantly less than control group values. Oxidative damage largely localized to myofibrils, with lesser labeling in other subcellular compartments. Accumulation of lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes, such as malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxy-2-alkenals, and protein carbonyls were measured biochemically and confirmed the morphological data. Our study is the first to quantify morphologically and localize the agedependent accrual of oxidative damage in mammalian skeletal muscle and to demonstrate that oxidative damage in primates is lowered by CR.—Zainal, T.

https://openalex.org/W2000766198,"This study investigated the effect of sex steroids and tamoxifen on primate mammary epithelial proliferation and steroid receptor gene expression. Ovariectomized rhesus monkeys were treated with placebo, 17beta estradiol (E2) alone or in combination with progesterone (E2/P) or testosterone (E2/T), or tamoxifen for 3 days. E2 alone increased mammary epithelial proliferation by approximately sixfold (P:<0.0001) and increased mammary epithelial estrogen receptor (ERalpha) mRNA expression by approximately 50% (P:<0.0001; ERbeta mRNA was not detected in the primate mammary gland). Progesterone did not alter E2's proliferative effects, but testosterone reduced E2-induced proliferation by approximately 40% (P:<0.002) and entirely abolished E2-induced augmentation of ERalpha expression. Tamoxifen had a significant agonist effect in the ovariectomized monkey, producing a approximately threefold increase in mammary epithelial proliferation (P:<0.01), but tamoxifen also reduced ERalpha expression below placebo level. Androgen receptor (AR) mRNA was detected in mammary epithelium by in situ hybridization. AR mRNA levels were not altered by E2 alone but were significantly reduced by E2/T and tamoxifen treatment. Because combined E2/T and tamoxifen had similar effects on mammary epithelium, we investigated the regulation of known sex steroid-responsive mRNAs in the primate mammary epithelium. E2 alone had no effect on apolipoprotein D (ApoD) or IGF binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) expression, but E2/T and tamoxifen treatment groups both demonstrated identical alterations in these mRNAs (ApoD was decreased and IGFBP5 was increased). These observations showing androgen-induced down-regulation of mammary epithelial proliferation and ER expression suggest that combined estrogen/androgen hormone replacement therapy might reduce the risk of breast cancer associated with estrogen replacement. In addition, these novel findings on tamoxifen's androgen-like effects on primate mammary epithelial sex steroid receptor expression suggest that tamoxifen's protective action on mammary gland may involve androgenic effects."

IL-10 induces T cell tolerance in natural high-dose antigen exposure and specific immunotherapyPeripheralT cell tolerance is induced in subjects naturally receiving high antigen loads as well as in specific immunotherapy of allergy. During the course of specific immunotherapy, the T cell proliferative response to major antigen is significantly suppressed in parallel to IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and interferon γ (IFN-γ) production.

https://openalex.org/W2114900551,"The hypothesis that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) can exert opposite effects on angiogenesis depending on the functional status of its domains/fragments was investigated. In the rabbit cornea, TSP-1 inhibited angiogenesis induced by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). However, when tested per se, TSP-1 was able to elicit an angiogenic response comparable to that induced by FGF-2. Induction of angiogenesis was dose-dependent (20 ng - 2 μg/pellet), was prevented by anti-TSP antibodies or by heat-inactivation of TSP-1, and was not due to inflammatory mediators, to FGF-2 or to TGF-β. Equimolar concentrations of the 25 kDa heparin binding fragment of TSP-1 were even more efficient than the whole molecule, and promoted the angiogenic activity of FGF-2. On the contrary, the 140 kDa fragment of TSP-1 did not induce angiogenesis and turned off the angiogenic response to FGF-2. The 25 kDa fragment and TSP-1, but not the 140 kDa fragment, increased endothelial cell invasiveness and stimulated the production and activation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Moreover, the 25 kDa fragment reduced the synthesis of the MMP-2 inhibitor TIMP-2, while the 140 kDa fragment caused a twofold increase in TIMP-2 production and inhibited MMPs stimulation by TSP-1 and FGF-2. We conclude that TSP-1 is a source of smaller mediators of angiogenesis, which affect in an opposite way endothelial cell functions and proteolytic activity, thus resulting in an opposite final effect on angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2065971267,"Three truncated fragments, harboring different sushi domains, namely, sushi123, sushi1, and sushi3 domains, of Factor C were produced as biologically active secreted recombinant proteins. Sushi1 and 3 each has a high-affinity LPS binding site with K:(d) of 10(-9) to 10(-10) M. Positive cooperativity in sushi123 resulted in a 1000-fold increase in K:(d)2. The core LPS binding region of sushi1 and 3 reside in two 34-mer peptides, S1 and S3. A rigidly held disulfide-bonded structure is not essential but is important for LPS binding, as confirmed by a 100- to 10000-fold decrease in affinity. Both S1 and S3 can inhibit LAL reaction and LPS-induced hTNF-alpha secretion with different potency. LAL assay revealed that at least two molecules of S1 bind cooperatively to one LPS molecule, with Hill's coefficient of 2.42. The LPS binding by S3 is independent and noncooperative. The modified SDelta1 and SDelta3 peptides exhibited increased LPS neutralization potential although its LPS binding affinities indicated only a 10-fold improvement. Hence, the structural difference of the four sushi peptides conferred different efficiencies in LPS neutralization without altering their binding affinity for LPS. Circular dichroism spectrometry revealed that the four peptides underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid A, transitioning from a random coil to either an alpha-helical or beta-sheet structure. Two factors are critical for the sensitivity of Factor C to LPS: 1) the presence of multiple binding sites for LPS on a single Factor C molecule; and 2) high positive cooperativity in LPS binding. The results showed that in the design of an improved LPS binding and neutralizing peptide, charge balance of the peptide is a critical parameter in addition to its structure."
https://openalex.org/W2109708615,"Application of cyclic stretch (10% at 1 hertz) to vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) increased L-arginine uptake and this was associated with a specific increase in cationic amino acid transporter-2 (CAT-2) mRNA. In addition, cyclic stretch stimulated L-arginine metabolism by inducing arginase I mRNA and arginase activity. In contrast, cyclic stretch inhibited the catabolism of L-arginine to nitric oxide (NO) by blocking inducible NO synthase expression. Exposure of SMC to cyclic stretch markedly increased the capacity of SMC to generate L-proline from L-arginine while inhibiting the formation of polyamines. The stretch-mediated increase in L-proline production was reversed by methyl-L-arginine, a competitive inhibitor of L-arginine transport, by hydroxy-L-arginine, an arginase inhibitor, or by the ornithine aminotransferase inhibitor L-canaline. Finally, cyclic stretch stimulated collagen synthesis and the accumulation of type I collagen, which was inhibited by L-canaline. These results demonstrate that cyclic stretch coordinately stimulates L-proline synthesis by regulating the genes that modulate the transport and metabolism of L-arginine. In addition, they show that stretch-stimulated collagen production is dependent on L-proline formation. The ability of hemodynamic forces to up-regulate L-arginine transport and direct its metabolism to L-proline may play an important role in stabilizing vascular lesions by promoting SMC collagen synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1566871980,"Whereas αβ T cell receptors (TCR) recognize processed antigenic peptides or glycolipids bound respectively to major histocompatibility complex or CD1 molecules, γδ TCR react differently to a broad set of native antigens. A major human γδ T cell subset is activated through a mechanism involving Vγ 9Vδ 2 TCR and structurally unrelated phosphorylated nonpeptide antigens (referred to as phosphoantigens). Here, the structure-function relationship of the strongest natural and synthetic phosphoantigens stimulating γδ cells was analyzed to elucidate the molecular basis of this unconventional recognition. Besides conformational determinants, we found that chemical reactivity of antigens is critical to their bioactivity. For Vγ 9Vδ 2 T cell activation, both organic and phosphorylated moieties of strong ligands undergo rapid and degradative structural changes. Conversely, analogs that are resistant to degradation specifically antagonize phosphoantigen-mediated γδ T cell activation. These data suggest a novel mode of antigen perception involving both topological recognition and ligand consumption, which confers highly specific γδ T cell activation by structurally diverse ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2016873349,"Synthesis of fatty acid (FA) in adipose tissue requires cooperation of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic enzymes. Mitochondria are required for the production of ATP and they also support the formation of acetyl-CoA and NADPH in cytoplasm. Since cellular levels of all these metabolites depend on the efficiency of mitochondrial energy conversion, mitochondrial proton leak via uncoupling proteins (UCPs) could modulate FA synthesis. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, 2,4-dinitrophenol depressed the synthesis of FA 4-fold while increasing FA oxidation 1. 5-fold and the production of lactate 14-fold. Inhibition of FA synthesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was proportional to the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. FA synthesis from D-[U-(14)C] glucose was reduced up to fourfold by ectopic UCP1 in the white fat of transgenic aP2-Ucp1 mice, reflecting the magnitude of UCP1 expression in different fat depots and the reduction of adiposity. Transcript levels for lipogenic enzymes were lower in the white fat of the transgenic mice than in the control animals. Our results show that uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation depresses FA synthesis in white fat. Reduction of adiposity via mitochondrial uncoupling in white fat not only reflects increased energy expenditure, but also decreased in situ lipogenesis."

We previously showed that pathogenic Escherichia coli, but not normal commensal organisms, increase galanin-1 receptor expression by epithelial cells lining the colon3 (i.e., colonocytes). When present, galanin-1 receptor activation by ligand causes colonocyte Cl− secretion 4. We herein demonstrate that disparate pathogens including Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexerii also increase colonocyte galanin-1 receptor expression, whose activation is responsible for a principal component of the increased colonic fluid secretion observed. Although eliminating the GAL1R gene by homologous recombination does not alter basal colonic fluid secretion, removal of one or both alleles completely attenuates the increase in fluid secretion due to infection with enteric pathogens. Galanin-1 receptor up-regulation therefore represents a novel mechanism accounting for the increased colonic fluid secretion observed in infectious diarrhea due to several different pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2005607608,"The nucleotide excision repair pathway contributes to genetic stability by removing a wide range of DNA damage through an error-free reaction. When the lesion is located, the altered strand is incised on both sides of the lesion and a damaged oligonucleotide excised. A repair patch is then synthesized and the repaired strand is ligated. It is assumed that only DNA polymerases delta and/or epsilon participate to the repair DNA synthesis step. Using UV and cisplatin-modified DNA templates, we measured in vitro that extracts from cells overexpressing the error-prone DNA polymerase beta exhibited a five- to sixfold increase of the ultimate DNA synthesis activity compared with control extracts and demonstrated the specific involvement of Pol beta in this step. By using a 28 nt gapped, double-stranded DNA substrate mimicking the product of the incision step, we showed that Pol beta is able to catalyze strand displacement downstream of the gap. We discuss these data within the scope of a hypothesis previously presented proposing that excess error-prone Pol beta in cancer cells could perturb the well-defined specific functions of DNA polymerases during error-free DNA transactions."

Neuronal apoptosis was induced by either staurosporine or the neurotoxin ethylcholine aziridinium (AF64A) with a delayed occurrence of apoptotic cell death (within 72 h). The apoptotic component of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) unmasked by glutamate antagonists served as a third model. As a model for necrotic cell death, OGD was applied. Neuronal injury was quantified by LDH release and loss of metabolic activity. Although melatonin (0.5 mM) partly protected cortical neurons from OGD-induced necrosis, as measured by a significant reduction in LDH release, it was not effective in all three models of apoptotic cell death. In contrast, exaggeration of neuronal damage by melatonin was observed in native cultures as well as after induction of apoptosis. The present data suggest that the neuroprotectiveness of melatonin strongly depends on the model of neuronal cell death applied. As demonstrated in three different models of neuronal apoptosis, the progression of the apoptotic type of neuronal cell death cannot be withhold or is even exaggerated by melatonin, in contrast to its beneficial effect in the necrotic type of cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1994601218,"Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) metabolism has been implicated in cellular and organismal aging. The role of rDNA in premature and normal human aging was investigated by measuring rDNA gene copy number, the level of rDNA methylation, and rRNA expression during the in vitro senescence of primary fibroblasts from normal (young and old) donors and from Werner syndrome (WS) patients. In comparison to their normal counterparts, WS fibroblasts grew slowly and reached senescence after fewer doublings. The rDNA copy number did not change significantly throughout the life span of both normal and WS fibroblasts. However, in senescent WS and normal old fibroblasts, we detected rDNA species with unusually slow electrophoretic mobility. Cellular aging in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is accompanied by the formation and accumulation of rDNA circles. Our analysis revealed that the rDNA species observed in this study were longer, linear rDNA molecules attributable to the inhibition of ECO:RI cleavage by methylation. Furthermore, isoschizomeric restriction analysis confirmed that in vitro senescence of fibroblasts is accompanied by significant increases in cytosine methylation within rDNA genes. This increased methylation is maximal during the abbreviated life span of WS fibroblasts. Despite increased methylation of rDNA in senescent cells, the steady-state levels of 28S rRNA remained constant over the life span of both normal and WS fibroblasts."

Human familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI) is an autosomal dominant endocrine disorder that presents in early childhood as excessive drinking and urination as a consequence of a progressive loss of secretion of vasopressin (VP) from posterior pituitary nerve terminals.2. Mutations in the VP gene have been implicated as the cause of FNDI, but the mechanisms by which these mutants manifest their pathology and prevent the secretion of the coexpressed wild-type protein are unknown.3. One hypothesis suggests that mutant precursors are toxic and stop the synthesis of wild-type VP by killing expressing cells. Another hypothesis suggests that aberrant interactions between mutant and wild-type precursors might inhibit the elaboration or secretion of the products of the normal allele.4.

We also found that hBH interacted and colocalized with APP as determined by subcellular fractionation, in vitro binding assay, and confocal immunolocalization. Metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments showed that ectopic hBH expression increased secretion of soluble APPα/β products without changing the half-life of cellular APP.

We examined the effect of hypoxia on Ca2+ efflux from the cytosol in single Fura-2-loaded pulmonary artery myocytes. During mild hypoxia (pO2=50–60 Torr), peak [Ca2+]i was increased and the rate of Ca2+ removal from the cytosol was markedly slowed after stimuli that elevated [Ca2+]i. Removal of extracellular Na+ potentiated the peak [Ca2+]i rise and slowed the Ca2+ decay rate in cells recorded under normoxic conditions; it did not further slow the Ca2+ decay rate or potentiate the [Ca2+]i increase in hypoxic cells. An Na+/Ca2+ exchange current was recorded in isolated pulmonary artery myocytes. Switching from Li+ to Na+ (130 mM) revealed an inward current with reversal potential consistent with the Na+/Ca2+ exchange current in cells in which [Ca2+]i was clamped at 1 μΜ; similar currents, although smaller, were observed with normal resting [Ca2+]i using the perforated patch clamp technique. The Na+/Ca2+ exchange current was markedly inhibited in myocytes exposed to mild hypoxia. RT-PCR revealed the expression of specific alternatively spliced RNAs of NCX1 in rat pulmonary arteries.

https://openalex.org/W2002247711,"Clustering of apoptotic cells is a characteristic of many developing or renewing systems, suggesting that apoptotic cells kill bystanders. Bystander killing can be triggered experimentally by inducing apoptosis in single cells and may be based on the exchange of as yet unidentified chemical cell death signals between nearby cells without the need for cell-to-cell communication via gap junctions. Here we demonstrate that apoptotic cell clusters occurred spontaneously, after serum deprivation or p53 transfection in cell monolayers in vitro. Clustering was apparently induced through bystander killing by primary apoptotic cells. Catalase, a peroxide scavenger, suppressed bystander killing, suggesting that hydrogen peroxide generated by apoptotic cells is the death signal. Although p53 expression increased the number of apoptoses, clustering was found to be similar around apoptotic cells whether or not p53 was expressed, indicating that there is no specific p53 contribution to bystander killing. Bystander killing through peroxides emitted by apoptotic cells may propagate tissue injury in different pathological situations and be relevant in chemo-, gamma-ray, and gene therapy of cancer."

PMEA was conjugated to bi- and trivalent cluster glycosides (K(GN)2 and K2(GN)3, respectively) with nanomolar affinity for the asialoglycoprotein receptor. The liver uptake of the PMEA prodrugs was more than 10-fold higher than that of the parent drug (52±6% and 62±3% vs. 4.8±0.7% of the injected dose for PMEA) and could be attributed for 90% to parenchymal cells. Accumulation of the PMEA prodrugs in extrahepatic tissue (e.g., kidney, skin) was substantially reduced. The ratio of parenchymal liver cell-to-kidney uptake—a measure of the prodrugs therapeutic window—was increased from 0.058 ± 0.01 for PMEA to 1.86 ± 0.57 for K(GN)2-PMEA and even 2.69 ± 0.24 for K2(GN)3-PMEA. Apparently both glycosides have a similar capacity to redirect (antiviral) drugs to the liver. After cellular uptake, both PMEA prodrugs were converted into the parent drug, PMEA, during acidification of the lysosomal milieu (t1/2≈100 min), and the released PMEA was rapidly translocated into the cytosol. The antiviral activity of the prodrugs in vitro was dramatically enhanced as compared to the parent drug (5- and 52-fold for K(GN)2-PMEA and K2(GN)3-PMEA, respectively). Given the 15-fold enhanced liver uptake of the prodrugs, we anticipate that the potency in vivo will be similarly increased. We conclude that PMEA prodrugs have been developed with greatly improved pharmacokinetics and therapeutic activity against viral infections that implicate the liver parenchyma (e.g., HBV).
