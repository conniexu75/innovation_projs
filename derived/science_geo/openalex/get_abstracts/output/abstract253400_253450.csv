https://openalex.org/W2119239003,"The p53 tumor-suppressor protein prevents cancer development through various mechanisms, including the induction of cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and the maintenance of genome stability. We have identified a p53-inducible gene named TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator). TIGAR expression lowered fructose-2,6-bisphosphate levels in cells, resulting in an inhibition of glycolysis and an overall decrease in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. These functions of TIGAR correlated with an ability to protect cells from ROS-associated apoptosis, and consequently, knockdown of endogenous TIGAR expression sensitized cells to p53-induced death. Expression of TIGAR may therefore modulate the apoptotic response to p53, allowing survival in the face of mild or transient stress signals that may be reversed or repaired. The decrease of intracellular ROS levels in response to TIGAR may also play a role in the ability of p53 to protect from the accumulation of genomic damage."

https://openalex.org/W2130758099,"Mitochondria amplify activation of caspases during apoptosis by releasing cytochrome c and other cofactors. This is accompanied by fragmentation of the organelle and remodeling of the cristae. Here we provide evidence that Optic Atrophy 1 (OPA1), a profusion dynamin-related protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane mutated in dominant optic atrophy, protects from apoptosis by preventing cytochrome c release independently from mitochondrial fusion. OPA1 does not interfere with activation of the mitochondrial ""gatekeepers"" BAX and BAK, but it controls the shape of mitochondrial cristae, keeping their junctions tight during apoptosis. Tightness of cristae junctions correlates with oligomerization of two forms of OPA1, a soluble, intermembrane space and an integral inner membrane one. The proapoptotic BCL-2 family member BID, which widens cristae junctions, also disrupts OPA1 oligomers. Thus, OPA1 has genetically and molecularly distinct functions in mitochondrial fusion and in cristae remodeling during apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2073742015,"The generation, manipulation and detection of spin-polarized electrons in nanostructures define the main challenges of spin-based electronics[1]. Amongst the different approaches for spin generation and manipulation, spin-orbit coupling, which couples the spin of an electron to its momentum, is attracting considerable interest. In a spin-orbit-coupled system, a nonzero spin-current is predicted in a direction perpendicular to the applied electric field, giving rise to a ""spin Hall effect""[2-4]. Consistent with this effect, electrically-induced spin polarization was recently detected by optical techniques at the edges of a semiconductor channel[5] and in two-dimensional electron gases in semiconductor heterostructures[6,7]. Here we report electrical measurements of the spin-Hall effect in a diffusive metallic conductor, using a ferromagnetic electrode in combination with a tunnel barrier to inject a spin-polarized current. In our devices, we observe an induced voltage that results exclusively from the conversion of the injected spin current into charge imbalance through the spin Hall effect. Such a voltage is proportional to the component of the injected spins that is perpendicular to the plane defined by the spin current direction and the voltage probes. These experiments reveal opportunities for efficient spin detection without the need for magnetic materials, which could lead to useful spintronics devices that integrate information processing and data storage."
https://openalex.org/W2150027419,"Inactivation of cell death is a major step in tumor development, and p53, a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in cancer, is a critical mediator of cell death. While a role for p53 in apoptosis is well established, direct links to other pathways controlling cell death are unknown. Here we describe DRAM (damage-regulated autophagy modulator), a p53 target gene encoding a lysosomal protein that induces macroautophagy, as an effector of p53-mediated death. We show that p53 induces autophagy in a DRAM-dependent manner and, while overexpression of DRAM alone causes minimal cell death, DRAM is essential for p53-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, analysis of DRAM in primary tumors revealed frequent decreased expression often accompanied by retention of wild-type p53. Collectively therefore, these studies not only report a stress-induced regulator of autophagy but also highlight the relationship of DRAM and autophagy to p53 function and damage-induced programmed cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2149273747,"Competitor species can have evolutionary effects on each other that result in ecological character displacement; that is, divergence in resource-exploiting traits such as jaws and beaks. Nevertheless, the process of character displacement occurring in nature, from the initial encounter of competitors to the evolutionary change in one or more of them, has not previously been investigated. Here we report that a Darwin's finch species (Geospiza fortis) on an undisturbed Galápagos island diverged in beak size from a competitor species (G. magnirostris) 22 years after the competitor's arrival, when they jointly and severely depleted the food supply. The observed evolutionary response to natural selection was the strongest recorded in 33 years of study, and close to the value predicted from the high heritability of beak size. These findings support the role of competition in models of community assembly, speciation, and adaptive radiations."

We now describe a specialization of the phagocytic pathway of DCs that allows a fine control of antigen processing. The NADPH oxidase NOX2 is recruited to the DC's early phagosomes and mediates the sustained production of low levels of reactive oxygen species, causing active and maintained alkalinization of the phagosomal lumen. DCs lacking NOX2 show enhanced phagosomal acidification and increased antigen degradation, resulting in impaired crosspresentation. Therefore, NOX2 plays a critical role in conferring DCs the ability to function as specialized phagocytes adapted to process antigens rather than kill pathogens.

DCs lacking NOX2 show enhanced phagosomal acidification and increased antigen degradation, resulting in impaired crosspresentation. Therefore, NOX2 plays a critical role in conferring DCs the ability to function as specialized phagocytes adapted to process antigens rather than kill pathogens. To initiate most cytotoxic immune responses, dendritic cells (DCs) must present proteolytic peptides derived from pathogens or infected cells to naïve CD8+ T lymphocytes (Banchereau and Steinman, 1998Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Dendritic cells and the control of immunity.Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (11831) Google Scholar). Phagocytosed antigens are presented to CD8+ T lymphocytes through a process called “crosspresentation” (Guermonprez et al., 2002Guermonprez P. Valladeau J. Zitvogel L. Thery C. Amigorena S.

Rev. 2004; 199: 9-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Crosspresentation requires antigen transit through endosomes or phagosomes and eventually partial proteolysis before transport to the cytosol and degradation by the proteasome into 8-9 amino acid peptides. These peptides are then translocated into the lumen of the ER or back into specialized mix ER-phagosome compartments and loaded onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (Cresswell, 2005Cresswell P. Antigen processing and presentation.Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This initial partial degradation of antigens must be tightly controlled, as it could destroy potential peptides for T cell recognition. In phagocytic cells, protein degradation is mediated by a large family of proteases, often referred to as “lysosomal proteases.” Most lysosomal proteases have an optimal proteolytic activity between pH 5.5 and 6.5 (Claus et al., 1998Claus V. Jahraus A. Tjelle T. Berg T. Kirschke H. Faulstich H. Griffiths G. Lysosomal enzyme trafficking between phagosomes, endosomes, and lysosomes in J774 macrophages. Enrichment of cathepsin H in early endosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9842-9851Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Phagosomes fuse first with early and late endosomes and then with lysosomes, thus acquiring progressively both the acidification machinery and the lysosomal proteases from the endocytic pathway (Claus et al., 1998Claus V.

Cell. 2004; 15: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In macrophages, phagosomes acidify very efficiently, reaching pH 5 in the first 30 min of phagocytosis (Hackam et al., 1998Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Zhang W. Gruenheid S. Gros P. Grinstein S.

Acidification results in a strong activation of lysosomal proteases, effective microbe toxicity, and protein degradation into amino acids. Acidification is mainly but not uniquely mediated by the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), which translocates protons from the cytosol into the lumen of endosomes, lysosomes, and phagosomes. Protons, however, can also enter phagosomes passively, through conductive channels (DeCoursey et al., 2001DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Morgan D. Katz B.Z. Dinauer M.C. The gp91phox component of NADPH oxidase is not the voltage-gated proton channel in phagocytes, but it helps.J. Biol.

Activation of H+ conductance in neutrophils requires assembly of components of the respiratory burst oxidase but not its redox function.J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or through other transporters such as voltage-gated proton channels (DeCoursey et al., 2003DeCoursey T.E. Morgan D. Cherny V.V. The voltage dependence of NADPH oxidase reveals why phagocytes need proton channels.Nature. 2003; 422: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In neutrophils, another large protein complex, the NADPH oxidase NOX2, mediates the transfer of electrons across endocytic (and plasma) membranes and also influences the phagosomal pH. This multicomponent enzyme is unassembled and inactive in resting cells but assembles at the phagosomal or plasma membrane in a stimulus-dependent manner (El-Benna et al., 2005El-Benna J. Dang P.M. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Elbim C. Phagocyte NADPH oxidase: a multicomponent enzyme essential for host defenses.Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp.

Oxidase subunits include cytosolic proteins such as p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and rac1 or rac2 (depending on the phagocyte cell type) and an integral membrane heterodimer, the cytochrom b558 (cyt b558), composed of p22phox and gp91phox. NOX2 activity generates superoxide anions in the phagocytic lumen, which dismutate to produce hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS). Production of ROS in neutrophils therefore consumes important amounts of protons, causing a transient but strong alkalinization (reaching pH 8) of the phagosome lumen during the oxidative burst (Jiang et al., 1997Jiang Q. Griffin D.A. Barofsky D.F. Hurst J.K. Intraphagosomal chlorination dynamics and yields determined using unique fluorescent bacterial mimics.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1080-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, Segal et al., 1981Segal A.W. Geisow M. Garcia R. Harper A. Miller R. The respiratory burst of phagocytic cells is associated with a rise in vacuolar pH.Nature. 1981; 290: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Very rapidly, however, ROS production stops, phagosome acidification resumes, and the pH drops within 30 min of phagocytosis (Segal, 2005Segal A.W. How neutrophils kill microbes.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 197-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, Segal et al., 1981Segal A.W. Geisow M. Garcia R. Harper A. Miller R. The respiratory burst of phagocytic cells is associated with a rise in vacuolar pH.Nature. 1981; 290: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). DCs also express NOX2 but at relatively low levels (around 5% of the levels found in neutrophils) (Elsen et al., 2004Elsen S. Doussiere J. Villiers C.L. Faure M. Berthier R. Papaioannou A. Grandvaux N. Marche P.N. Vignais P.V. Cryptic O2- -generating NADPH oxidase in dendritic cells.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2215-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The very low levels of ROS production in DCs suggest that NOX2 may not be involved in microbe killing, particularly since DCs' main function is mostly related to the initiation of adaptative immune responses and not to microbe toxicity. Indeed, DCs have developed specific means of control of endocytic functions that allow efficient antigen presentation. These specializations of the endocytic pathway include the regulated transport of MHC molecules (Mellman and Steinman, 2001Mellman I. Steinman R.M.

Phagosomes are competent organelles for antigen cross-presentation.Nature. 2003; 425: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Recent results show that DCs bear low levels of lysosomal proteases (Delamarre et al., 2005Delamarre L. Pack M. Chang H. Mellman I. Trombetta E.S. Differential lysosomal proteolysis in antigen-presenting cells determines antigen fate.Science. 2005; 307: 1630-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, Lennon-Dumenil et al., 2002Lennon-Dumenil A.M.

Analysis of protease activity in live antigen-presenting cells shows regulation of the phagosomal proteolytic contents during dendritic cell activation.J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and that lysosome acidification in immature DCs is inefficient due to limited recruitment of the cytosolic subunits of the V-ATPase to endosomes and lysosomes, as compared to macrophages or mature DCs (Trombetta et al., 2003Trombetta E.S. Ebersold M. Garrett W. Pypaert M. Mellman I. Activation of lysosomal function during dendritic cell maturation.Science. 2003; 299: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). DCs' endocytic pathway can therefore be considered as “specialized” antigen presentation compartments rather than purely degradative organelles. To date, however, none of these specializations of the endocytic compartments in DCs was shown genetically to be indispensable for antigen presentation to T cells. We now describe a novel specific adaptation of DCs' endocytic pathway to the antigen presentation function. NOX2, a major player of innate immunity in neutrophils, is recruited to immature DC phagosomes, causing active and sustained phagosome alkalinization. In NOX2-defective DCs, phagosomal acidification and antigen degradation were increased, causing a defect in crosspresentation. These results provide the first genetic evidence that a specialization of DCs' endocytic pathway, i.e., active alkalinization of phagosomes by NOX2, is required for efficient antigen crosspresentation to CD8+ T cells. Efficient antigen processing in phagosomes requires the limited and controlled degradation of protein antigens from phagocytosed cells or cell fragments. Generation of the maximal possible array of peptides for loading on MHC molecules without destroying potentially antigenic peptides implicates a precise control of the activity of lysosomal proteases. One of the most direct ways of controlling the activity of lysosomal proteases is certainly by the pH. In order to measure phagosomal pH in DCs accurately, we set up phagosomal pH measurement by flow cytometry (fluorescence activated cell sorter, or FACS). Latex beads were coated with pH-sensitive (fluorescein isothiocyanate, or FITC) and pH-insensitive (FluoProbe647) fluorescent dyes. After different times of phagocytosis of the beads, the fluorescence intensity was quantified using FACS. The ratio in fluorescence intensity between the two dyes reflected the pH in the phagosomal environment, as shown by imposing fixed pH after permeabilization of the cells (Figure S1A). As shown in Figure 1A, after a 20 min phagocytosis pulse and 30 min of incubation at 37°C (chase), the fluorescence intensity of FITC was much higher in DCs than in macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, indicating that the pH in DC phagosomes was less acidic than in macrophages. By reporting the mean fluorescence intensity in the two cell populations to a standard curve (see Figure S1 and the Experimental Procedures), the actual pH values in phagosomes were determined. As expected, the pH in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMO) and RAW 264.7 (Figure 1B) or J774 cells (not shown) was below 6 after a 20 min pulse and a 10 min chase and acidified further over a 3 hr chase, reaching values around pH 5. In contrast, the pH in DC phagosomes was much higher, reaching 7.5 after 60–120 min (Figure 1B). No significant acidification was observed during the first 3 hr of phagocytosis, although the pH did gradually acidify after longer times of phagocytosis (not shown). A similarly alkaline phagosomal pH (around 7.3) was also found in freshly isolated spleen DCs (Figure 1C). Therefore, the pH in DC phagosomes is alkaline and does not acidify significantly in the first 3 hr of phagocytosis. The previously described ineffective acidification in DC lysosomes (Trombetta et al., 2003Trombetta E.S. Ebersold M. Garrett W. Pypaert M. Mellman I. Activation of lysosomal function during dendritic cell maturation.Science. 2003; 299: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) is probably insufficient to account for these results since the phagosomal pH reached values actually higher than the extracellular medium, suggesting the existence of an active mechanism of alkalinization. We reasoned that if such an alkalinization process existed in DCs, it should become more evident upon blockade of the V-ATPase present in DC phagosomes. This hypothesis was addressed by analyzing DCs' phagosomal pH in the presence of ConcanamycinB (ConB, a specific inhibitor of the V-ATPase) (Benaroch et al., 1995Benaroch P. Yilla M. Raposo G. Ito K. Miwa K. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. How MHC class II molecules reach the endocytic pathway.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, Yilla et al., 1993Yilla M. Tan A. Ito K. Miwa K. Ploegh H.L. Involvement of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPases in the secretory pathway of HepG2 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19092-19100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 1D, 1.5 nM of ConB induced a strong alkalinization of the phagosomal pH, reaching pH 8 (the higher limit of the FITC-based pH measure system used here) after 10 min of chase. In order to explore if such phagosomal alkalinization system was specific to DCs, we performed similar experiments using BMMO. Low (1.5 nM) ConB concentrations had no significant effect on phagosomal pH in macrophages, while high concentrations (30 nM) neutralized the phagosomal pH (from pH 5.3–5.8 to pH 7–7.35) (Figure 1E). As shown previously (Hackam et al., 1998Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Zhang W. Gruenheid S. Gros P. Grinstein S. Host resistance to intracellular infection: mutation of natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (Nramp1) impairs phagosomal acidification.J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, Yates and Russell, 2005Yates R.M. Russell D.G. Phagosome maturation proceeds independently of stimulation of toll-like receptors 2 and 4.Immunity. 2005; 23: 409-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), alkalinization of the phagosomal pH was observed in BMMO upon blockade of the V-ATPase. We concluded that DCs and not macrophages bear an active machinery of phagosomal alkalinization, which maintains the phagosomal pH between 7 and 7.5 in the first few hours after phagocytosis. Upon inactivation of the V-ATPase, the phagosomal pH in DCs (but not in BMMO) alkalinizes strongly, showing that the V-ATPase is active, at least to some extent, in DC phagosomes. In neutrophils, NOX2 generates ROS, which causes transient phagosome alkalinization, in part through the consumption of protons in the phagocytic lumen (Lee et al., 2003Lee W.L. Harrison R.E. Grinstein S. Phagocytosis by neutrophils.Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, Segal, 2005Segal A.W. How neutrophils kill microbes.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 197-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that ROS generation by NOX2 in DC phagosomes could be responsible for the active alkalinization of phagosomes in DCs. Since the intracellular localization of NOX2 transmembrane subunits in DCs has not been previously examined, we first analyzed the subcellular distribution of gp91phox using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. In resting DCs, gp91phox localizes to vesicular structures (Figure 2A) distributed throughout the cell, including dendrites, suggesting proximity with the plasma membrane. To investigate the morphology of gp91phox-positives structures, we analyzed the intracellular stores of cyt b558 using immunoelectron microscopy. Specific labeling of dense structures, similar to cyt b558-containing vesicles in neutrophils (Calafat et al., 1993Calafat J. Kuijpers T.W. Janssen H. Borregaard N. Verhoeven A.J. Roos D. Evidence for small intracellular vesicles in human blood phagocytes containing cytochrome b558 and the adhesion molecule CD11b/CD18.Blood. 1993; 81: 3122-3129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was often observed in the cell profiles (Figure 2B). When we analyzed the cells after 30 min of phagocytosis, cyt b558 was also visible in phagosomes (Figure 2C), indicating the recruitment of NOX2 to this compartment. To explore the recruitment of NOX2 to phagosomes more precisely, phagosomes were purified from wt and gp91phox-deficient DCs after different times of phagocytosis. DCs from gp91phox−/− mice developed normally, displayed a phenotype indistinguishable from that of wt (wild-type) DCs, and responded normally to LPS (Figure S2). Recruitment of the gp91phox to purified phagosomes was analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Figure 2D, gp91phox was recruited to phagosomes over time from wt DCs but not from gp91phox-deficient DCs. Quantification of the Western blots showed that the membrane components of NOX2 are effectively and rapidly recruited to DC phagosomes (Figure 2E). We next attempted to determine if NOX2 was active in DC phagosomes. Activation of NOX2 implicates the recruitment of the cytosolic subunits such as p47phox to the membrane subunits (Cross and Segal, 2004Cross A.R. Segal A.W. The NADPH oxidase of professional phagocytes-prototype of the NOX electron transport chain systems.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1654: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). A clear label of the phagosomal membrane with anti-p47phox antibodies was evident after 1 hr of phagocytosis in wt DCs (Figure 3A, upper panels). A quantification of the fluorescence level around the phagosomes is depicted in Figure 3B. In gp91phox−/− DCs, no labeling of the phagosomes was observed, consistent with the known role of gp91phox in the membrane recruitment of p47phox (Figures 3A and 3B, lower panels). We conclude that NOX2 is effectively assembled on DC phagosomes only when gp91phox is present, suggesting that NOX2 is functional in this compartment in DCs. DCs have previously been shown to produce low levels of ROS (Elsen et al., 2004Elsen S. Doussiere J. Villiers C.L. Faure M. Berthier R. Papaioannou A. Grandvaux N. Marche P.N. Vignais P.V.

Yang C. Mummert M.E. Oeda J. Masayasu H. Takashima A. Generation and function of reactive oxygen species in dendritic cells during antigen presentation.J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3010-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To address the possible generation of ROS specifically in phagosomes, we covalently linked dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR), a dye that only emits fluorescence under oxidative conditions, to latex beads (Vowells et al., 1995Vowells S.J. Sekhsaria S. Malech H.L. Shalit M. Fleisher T.A. Flow cytometric analysis of the granulocyte respiratory burst: a comparison study of fluorescent probes.J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 178: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). As shown in Figures 3C (fluorescence microscopy) and 3D (FACS analysis), DHR-coated beads became fluorescent after phagocytosis, showing the production of ROS in DC phagosomes. This fluorescent signal was strongly inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI), a specific inhibitor of flavin-containing enzymes such as NOX2. ROS production was not observed in phagosomes from gp91phox-deficient DCs. We conclude that the phagosomal environment in DCs is oxidative due to ROS generation by NOX2. Like DCs, macrophages have been shown previously to produce ROS during phagocytosis or after activation (Forman and Torres, 2002Forman H.J. Torres M. Reactive oxygen species and cell signaling: respiratory burst in macrophage signaling.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 166: S4-S8Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). To compare ROS production over time in DCs and macrophages, we used a conventional luminol-based technique for ROS quantification. We first measured ROS production in DCs and BMMO treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). PMA activates the protein kinase C, a potent activator of NOX2 (el Benna et al., 1994el Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. The phosphorylation of the respiratory burst oxidase component p47phox during neutrophil activation. Phosphorylation of sites recognized by protein kinase C and by proline-directed kinases.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ROS production in response to PMA was reproducibly higher and lasted longer in DCs than in macrophages (Figure 4A). In DCs, the inactivation was much slower, and significant ROS production was detected even after 2 hr of stimulation (Figure 4A). As expected, no ROS production was observed in gp91phox-deficient DCs (not shown). We concluded that the total capacity of ROS production is higher and NOX2 inactivation is slower in immature DCs than in BMMO. In order to evaluate ROS production selectively in phagosomes, we modified the classical technique used in Figure 4A by covalently attaching luminol to latex beads. ROS production in DC phagosomes was stronger and more sustained than in phagosomes from BMMO both in the absence (Figure 4B) and the presence of PMA (Figure 4C). In order to exclude that BMMO degrade the luminol attached to the beads, thus preventing efficient ROS detection in phagosomes, PMA was added to macrophages after 3 hr of phagocytosis (Figure 4B, arrow). The activation of NOX2 in phagosomes was also estimated through the analysis of the recruitment of p47phox to phagosomes using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. After 30 min of phagocytosis, effective NOX2 assembly on phagosomes was detected in both DCs and BMMO (Figure 4D). The fluorescent labeling of p47phox was more evident after 60 min of chase in both cell types. As shown in Figure 4D (lower panels), after 180 min of phagocytosis, however, only DC phagosomes maintained a clear labeling for p47phox (78% of DC phagosomes were visibly labeled, against 14% of BMMO phagosomes; at least 50 phagosomes analyzed in each case). We concluded that the sustained production of ROS in phagosomes from immature DCs is due to a prolonged assembly and activation of the NOX2 complex in DC phagosomes, as compared to BMMO phagosomes. In order to test the possible involvement of NOX2 in the control of the phagosomal pH, we next measured phagosomal pH in gp91phox −/− DCs. The phagosomal pH was strongly decreased in gp91phox-defective DCs, as compared to wt DCs (Figures 5A and 5B), indicating that NOX2 activity controls pH in DC phagosomes. In contrast, wt and gp91phox-defective BMMO acidify their phagosomes with similar efficiencies (Figure 5C), indicating that the role of NOX2 in the control of phagosomal pH is restricted to DCs. Nevertheless, even in the absence of gp91phox, phagosome acidification in DCs was not as efficient as that observed in macrophages (in which the pH dropped to 5.2 in 60 min; see Figures 1B and 5C). Upon blockade of the V-ATPase with ConB, the marked alkalinization observed in phagosomes from wt DCs was not observed in gp91phox-defective DCs (Figure 5D), showing that NOX2 mediates phagosome alkalinization in DCs. Surprisingly, neutralization of the phagosomal pH by ConB in the gp91phox-deficient DCs was observed only after 120 min, and not after 30 min of phagocytosis (Figure 5D), suggesting that in the long-term absence of NOX2 in phagosomes, other proton import pathways may become preeminent and mediate some degree of acidification. Indeed, when NOX2 was blocked at 30 min chase using DPI in wt DCs, the pH acidified within 15 min (Figure 5E). Upon inactivation of the V-ATPase by ConB, however, the pH increased in 15 min (Figure 5E), showing that in the absence of active NOX2, the V-ATPase still mediated acidification in DC phagosomes. We conclude that NOX2 recruitment to DC phagosomes contributes to alkalinize the phagosomal lumen and maintains the pH above 7, in spite of the activity of the V-ATPase. In the absence of ROS generation in DC phagosomes (in the gp91phox-defective DCs or in the presence of DPI), the pH acidifies rapidly. We next sought to evaluate the functional consequences of such a drop in phagosomal pH in terms of antigen degradation. To follow antigen degradation selectively in phagosomes, as opposed to all endocytic compartments, we set up a quantitative cytofluorometric assay for phagosomal degradation. After phagocytosis of beads covalently attached to OVA, the cells were lysed and the amount of OVA remaining on the beads was quantified using polyclonal OVA-specific antibodies and FACS analysis on the isolated beads. As shown in Figure 6A, a marked decrease over time in the amount of OVA attached to the beads was observed in wt DCs after 20 min pulse and 2 hr chase. This decrease was less pronounced in the presence of the protease inhibitors leupeptin and pepstatin (Figure 6A, lower panel) or in DC phagosomes from Cathepsin S (Cat S)-deficient mice (Figure 6B). We conclude that decreased immunofluorescence on the beads was due to actual degradation rather than denaturation of OVA. As shown in Figure 6C, ConB induced a marked inhibition of OVA degradation, showing that the lysosomal proteases present in phagosomes are more active at pH 7–7.5 (the pH in control DCs) than at pH 7.5–8 (the pH in ConB-treated DCs; see Figure 1D). On the contrary, in gp91phox-deficient DCs, in which the phagosomal pH is more acidic than in wt DCs (see Figure 5), the degradation of bead bound OVA was accelerated as compared to wt DCs, as shown in fluorescence intensity histograms from one representative experiment after 30 and 120 min of chase (Figure 6D). Over five independent experiments, the acceleration of OVA degradation in DCs from gp91phox-deficient mice, as compared to wt DCs, was most evident after 30 min of chase (Figure 6E). We conclude that NOX2 activity in DC phagosomes limits antigen degradat"

Researchers at the Department of Neuroscience at Brown University, working with biotech company Cyberkinetics and 3 other institutions, demonstrate that movement-related signals can be relayed from the brain via an implanted BrainGate chip, allowing the patient to drive a computer screen cursor and activate simple robotic devices. Such neuromotor prostheses could pave the way towards systems to replace or restore lost motor function in paralysed humans. Prior to this advance, this type of work has been performed chiefly in monkeys. The latest example of such research has achieved a large increase in speed over current devices, enhancing the prospects for clinically viable brain-machine interfaces. A new type of brain–machine interface device enables recording of neural activity in the monkey cortex and extraction of intended target signals, leaving the monkey able to place a cursor on a location, just by thinking about it. Recent studies have demonstrated that monkeys1,2,3,4 and humans5,6,7,8,9 can use signals from the brain to guide computer cursors. Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) may one day assist patients suffering from neurological injury or disease, but relatively low system performance remains a major obstacle. In fact, the speed and accuracy with which keys can be selected using BCIs is still far lower than for systems relying on eye movements. This is true whether BCIs use recordings from populations of individual neurons using invasive electrode techniques1,2,3,4,5,7,8 or electroencephalogram recordings using less-6 or non-invasive9 techniques. Here we present the design and demonstration, using electrode arrays implanted in monkey dorsal premotor cortex, of a manyfold higher performance BCI than previously reported9,10. These results indicate that a fast and accurate key selection system, capable of operating with a range of keyboard sizes, is possible (up to 6.5 bits per second, or ∼15 words per minute, with 96 electrodes). The highest information throughput is achieved with unprecedentedly brief neural recordings, even as recording quality degrades over time. These performance results and their implications for system design should substantially increase the clinical viability of BCIs in humans."

A crystal structure of the gB ectodomain from herpes simplex virus type 1 reveals a multidomain trimer with unexpected homology to glycoprotein G from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV G). An alpha-helical coiled-coil core relates gB to class I viral membrane fusion glycoproteins; two extended beta hairpins with hydrophobic tips, homologous to fusion peptides in VSV G, relate gB to class II fusion proteins. Members of both classes accomplish fusion through a large-scale conformational change, triggered by a signal from a receptor-binding component.

Here, we show that a conserved P. syringae virulence protein, HopM1, targets an immunity-associated protein, AtMIN7, in Arabidopsis thaliana. HopM1 mediates the destruction of AtMIN7 via the host proteasome. Our results illustrate a strategy by which a bacterial pathogen exploits the host proteasome to subvert host immunity and causes infection in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2164380664,"Correct positioning of the division plane is a prerequisite for the generation of daughter cells with a normal chromosome complement. Here, we present a mechanism that coordinates assembly and placement of the FtsZ cytokinetic ring with bipolar localization of the newly duplicated chromosomal origins in Caulobacter. After replication of the polarly located origin region, one copy moves rapidly to the opposite end of the cell in an MreB-dependent manner. A previously uncharacterized essential protein, MipZ, forms a complex with the partitioning protein ParB near the origin of replication and localizes with the duplicated origin regions to the cell poles. MipZ directly interferes with FtsZ polymerization, thereby restricting FtsZ ring formation to midcell, the region of lowest MipZ concentration. The cellular localization of MipZ thus serves the dual function of positioning the FtsZ ring and delaying formation of the cell division apparatus until chromosome segregation has initiated."

We show that RDR2, DCL3, AGO4, and NRPD1b (the largest subunit of Pol IVb) colocalize with siRNAs within the nucleolus. By contrast, Pol IVa and DRD1 are external to the nucleolus and colocalize with endogenous repeat loci. Mutation-induced loss of pathway proteins causes downstream proteins to mislocalize, revealing their order of action. Pol IVa acts first, and its localization is RNA dependent, suggesting an RNA template. We hypothesize that maintenance of the heterochromatic state involves locus-specific Pol IVa transcription followed by siRNA production and assembly of AGO4- and NRPD1b-containing silencing complexes within nucleolar processing centers."

https://openalex.org/W2147765162,"The terminal t-loop structure adopted by mammalian telomeres is thought to prevent telomeres from being recognized as double-stranded DNA breaks by sequestering the 3′ single-stranded G-rich overhang from exposure to the DNA damage machinery. The POT1 (protection of telomeres) protein binds the single-stranded overhang and is required for both chromosomal end protection and telomere length regulation. The mouse genome contains two POT1 orthologs, Pot1a and Pot1b. Here we show that conditional deletion of Pot1a elicits a DNA damage response at telomeres, resulting in p53-dependent replicative senescence. Pot1a-deficient cells exhibit overall telomere length and 3′ overhang elongation as well as aberrant homologous recombination (HR) at telomeres, manifested as increased telomere sister chromatid exchanges and formation of telomere circles. Telomeric HR following Pot1a loss requires NBS1. Pot1a deletion also results in chromosomal instability. Our results suggest that POT1a is crucial for the maintenance of both telomere integrity and overall genomic stability."

Double-knockout cells showed that POT1a/b are required to prevent a DNA damage signal at chromosome ends, endoreduplication, and senescence. In contrast, POT1a/b were largely dispensable for repression of telomere fusions. Single knockouts and complementation experiments revealed that POT1a and POT1b have distinct functions. POT1a, but not POT1b, was required to repress a DNA damage signal at telomeres. Conversely, POT1b, but not POT1a, had the ability to regulate the amount of single-stranded DNA at the telomere terminus. We conclude that mouse telomeres require two distinct POT1 proteins whereas human telomeres have one. Such divergence is unprecedented in mammalian chromosome biology and has implications for modeling human telomere biology in mice."

The resulting variations of the interaction energy reduce friction below 10 piconewtons in a finite range of excitation and load, without any noticeable wear.

To identify candidate Gpa1 effectors, we expressed the constitutively active Gpa1Q323L mutant in each of nearly 5000 gene-deletion strains and measured mating-specific responses. Our analysis reveals a requirement for both the catalytic (Vps34) and regulatory (Vps15) subunits of the sole phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in yeast. We demonstrate that Gpa1 is present at endosomes, where it interacts directly with both Vps34 and Vps15 and stimulates increased production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. Notably, Vps15 binds to GDP-bound Gpa1 and is predicted to have a seven-WD repeat structure similar to that of known G protein β subunits. These findings reveal two new components of the pheromone signaling pathway. More remarkably, these proteins appear to comprise a preformed effector-Gβ subunit assembly and function at the endosome rather than at the plasma membrane."

Since activation of separase by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) is supposedly not required for meiosis I in Xenopus oocytes, it has been suggested that animal cells might resolve chiasmata by a separase-independent mechanism related to the so-called ""prophase pathway"" that removes cohesin from chromosome arms during mitosis. By expressing Cre recombinase from a zona pellucida promoter, we have deleted a floxed allele of separase specifically in mouse oocytes. This prevents removal of Rec8 from chromosome arms and resolution of chiasmata. It also hinders extrusion of the first polar body (PBE) and causes female sterility. mRNA encoding wild-type but not catalytically inactive separase restores chiasma resolution.

Cell. 2000; 5: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), which is identical to a kinase named IKK-i identified via its induction downstream of LPS-induced signaling (6Shimada T.

IKKϵ in turn is closely related to another recently discovered IKK-related kinase designated as TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1) (7Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6694-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or NAK (NF-κB activating kinase) (8Tojima Y. Fujimoto A. Delhase M. Chen Y. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kaneko Y. Nimura Y. Motoyama N.

TBK1, which is highly homologous to IKKϵ, binds to TANK and TRAF and may form an alternative IKK complex consisting of IKKϵ and TBK1 (7Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6694-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IKKϵ and TBK1 are enzymatically distinct from the homologous enzymes IKKα and IKKβ (9Kishore N. Huynh Q.K. Mathialagan S. Hall T. Rouw S.

It has also been shown that IFN-β and IFN-inducible gene expression is defective in TBK1 knock-out cells in response to LPS, poly(I:C), or viral infection (14Takeuchi O. Hemmi H. Akira S. J.

Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the exact molecular mechanism of NF-κB activation by these kinases is not clearly understood. One report (19Buss H. Dorrie A. Schmitz M.L. Hoffmann E. Resch K. Kracht M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55633-55643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) indicated that IKKϵ plays a key role integrating signals induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli by activating CAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ whose expression is regulated by NF-κB. There is a recent report suggesting that IKKϵ and TBK1 are among the kinases that mediate inducible phosphorylation of p65 at Ser-536 (19Buss H. Dorrie A. Schmitz M.L. Hoffmann E. Resch K. Kracht M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55633-55643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), an event proposed to stimulate inherent p65 transactivation function (20Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, TBK1 and IKKϵ would control NF-κB at a level distinct from the traditional IKK-mediated control of IκB degradation. Here, we show that IKKϵ is expressed in a variety of cancer cell lines. Based on this, we have investigated a role for IKKϵ as related to constitutive, cancer-associated NF-κB activity. Our experiments reveal an important role for IKKϵ in controlling the activation of Ser-536 phosphorylation of the RelA/p65 subunit and functional NF-κB activity in several cancer cell lines and in 293T cells. Reagents and Materials—All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, complemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Generation of wild-type, IKKϵ single, and IKKϵ-TBK1 double knock-out cells was described previously (15Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Yamamoto M. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Kawai T. Hoshino K. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), and they were the kind gift of S. Akira. A monoclonal antibody against FLAG (M2) was obtained from Sigma. An antibody to IKKϵ and to phospho-specific NF-κB p65 (Ser-536) were obtained from Cell Signaling. Antibodies to β-tubulin and to IκBα were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to IKKα and IKKβ were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. LPS (L6529, Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Recombinant human TNF-α (Promega) was used at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. Recombinant mouse interleukin-1β (Roche Applied Sciences) was used at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. Effectene transfection reagent obtained from Qiagen was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmids and Constructs—3X-κB luciferase reporter construct contains 3 κB consensus DNA binding sites from the major histocompatibility complex class I promoter fused upstream of firefly luciferase. Wild-type and kinase mutant forms of FLAG-tagged IKKϵ (IKKϵ K38) have been described previously (5Peters R.T. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Wild-type and kinase mutant forms of TBK1 (TBK1 K38) have been described previously (11Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J. Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) and were the kind gift of J. Hiscott. pLuc-110 IFNβ reporter constructs have been described previously (10Fitzgerald K.A.

Maniatis. Transfections and Reporter Assays—For transient transfections, the indicated cell lines were seeded in 6-well plates at 30–50% density and transfected the next day with the indicated expression vectors for 48 h using Effectene (Qiagen) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. For reporter assays, 2 × 105 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and co-transfected the next day with the indicated luciferase reporter genes and a β-galactosidase reporter gene as an internal control. The total amount of transfected DNA (500 ng of DNA) in each well was adjusted by adding empty plasmid vector (pcDNA3.1). Luciferase activity of whole cell lysates was measured by using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was measured by liquid β-galactosidase assay with chlorophenolred-β-d-galactopyranoside substrate. Relative luciferase activity was calculated by normalizing the assay results to β-galactosidase expression values. Luciferase -fold induction was calculated by normalizing the results to control treatment, which was assumed as 1 -fold induction. Western Blot—After stimulation, cultured cells were lysed on ice for 5 min in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer with freshly added protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 13,000 × g. The amount of total protein was measured, and equal amounts (20 μg) were fractionated by NuPAGE Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blotted with the indicated antibodies, and proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Where indicated, membranes were stripped and re-probed with the indicated antibodies. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—EMSAs were performed as previously described (21Mayo M.W. Norris J.L. Baldwin A.S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4–5 μg of nuclear extracts prepared following cell stimulation was incubated with a radiolabeled DNA probe containing an NF-κB consensus site. For supershifts, 1 μl of anti-p65 antibody (Rockland) or 2 μl of anti-p50 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-7178) was added, and the binding reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional 15 min. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. siRNA and shRNA Transfection—IKKϵ mRNA was knocked down with the GeneSupressor System (IMGENEX). Plasmids encoding control shRNA and IKKϵ shRNA were transfected by Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions for 48–72 h. Additionally, Silencer® predesigned siRNA targeting IKKϵ and TBK1 have also been utilized and were transfected with a Silencer® siRNA Transfection II kit. Lysate preparation and Western blots were performed as described. Cell Proliferation and MTT Assay—A cell proliferation assay has been performed as described by using the TACS MTT assay kit (R&D Systems). First, the optimal cell number, which was 1 × 104 for HeLa cells in our system, was determined. After transfection, an equal number of cells was seeded in a 96-well plate for the indicated times. 10 μl of MTT reagent was added to each well, including the blank wells, and the mixture was incubated for 4–5 h at 37 °C. Then 100 μl of detergent reagent was added, the mixture was incubated for at least 12 h at 37 °C, and absorbance values at 570 nm were measured with a reference wavelength of 650 nm. IKKϵ Is Expressed in a Number of Cancer Cells and in SV40 Large T-immortalized 293 Cells—To address a potential role for IKKϵ in controlling NF-κB activity, we explored the expression of IKKϵ in a variety of cell lines. Immunoblotting of extracts of several cancer cell lines revealed constitutive expression of IKKϵ in breast cancer cell lines MDA MB 468, SK BR3, Sum 226, and MCF7; HeLa cells; PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells; and 293T embryonic kidney cells (Fig. 1). As a marker for endogenous NF-κB activity, we immunoblotted the extracts from these cells with an antibody that recognizes only the RelA/p65 subunit phosphorylated at Ser-536. These data revealed a correlation between IKKϵ expression and phosphorylated Ser-536 RelA/p65 in most of the cells analyzed. Notably, TBK1 was expressed in these cells but did not consistently correlate with RelA/p65 Ser-536 phosphorylation. The data also reveal that IKKϵ, although considered an inducible kinase, is found to be constitutively expressed at significant levels in most of the cell lines investigated. IKKϵ or TBK1 Activates an NF-κB-dependent Reporter in a Kinase-dependent Manner—To investigate a potential role for IKKϵ and TBK1 in NF-κB regulation, experiments were initiated to analyze their potential involvement in controlling NF-κB-dependent promoters. Based on the results from Fig. 1, we focused these experiments on HEK 293T cells, because IKKϵ is expressed and is potentially active in these cells. Both IKKϵ and TBK1, but not their kinase mutant forms, activated the 3X-κB and IFN-β luciferase promoter constructs (Fig. 2, A and B). Unlike the 3X-κB promoter, the IFN-β promoter is considered a complex promoter regulated by coordinate actions of NF-κB and other transcription factors; therefore, it is not considered to be regulated exclusively by NF-κB. These results are similar to those of Shimada et al. (6Shimada T. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Inoue J. Tatsumi Y. Kanamaru A. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in all of the assays performed, TBK1 was observed to be a better activator of the reporters (Fig. 2, A and B). Analysis of the effects of different concentrations of IKKϵ on activation of the 3X-κB luciferase reporter showed that -fold induction of luciferase activity is proportional to the IKKϵ plasmid concentration, whereas there was no significant induction with the vector control or with the kinase mutant (KM) form of IKKϵ (Fig. 2C). IKKϵ Expression Induces NF-κB DNA Binding Activity—We next investigated whether IKKϵ expression can induce NF-κB binding to a consensus DNA target sequence. FLAG-tagged IKKϵ was transiently expressed in HEK 293T cells for ∼48 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared for EMSAs. As shown in Fig. 3A, IKKϵ effectively induced the DNA binding activity of NF-κB. TNF-α is included in this experiment for comparison purposes. It should be noted that there is basal NF-κB DNA binding activity in the VC lane (lane 1), which is better visualized given longer exposure times. TNF-α stimulation of IKKϵ-overexpressing cells led to more DNA binding activity, but this increase appears to be an additive effect of TNF-α and IKKϵ rather than a synergistic effect. Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic extracts, shown in the lower panel, demonstrates expression levels of IKKϵ. We next aimed to investigate the nature of the major NF-κB subunits in this bound complex by gel shift assay. For this purpose each of the reactions used in Fig. 3A was incubated with the indicated antibody and electrophoresed on a separate gel (Fig. 3B). The number at the top of the figure indicates the lane numbers (lanes 1–4) from the reactions used in Fig. 3A. In the lanes where an NF-κB complex was detected (lanes 2–4), there was a positive response with the p65 and p50 antibodies. Therefore, we concluded that the complex that bound to this consensus binding site is composed predominantly of p65/p50 heterodimers (Fig. 3B). It should be noted that a single nucleotide change can lead to binding of different NF-κB subunits (22Leung T.H. Hoffmann A. Baltimore D. Cell. 2004; 118: 453-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 23Natoli G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that other subunits might also be activated and bind to slightly different NF-κB binding sites. TBK1 expression effects on DNA binding activity of NF-κB yielded very similar results (data not shown). IKKϵ and TBK1 Expression Leads to Phosphorylation of Endogenous p65 at Ser-536—Recent studies have shown that post-translational modification of NF-κB subunits, such as p65, contribute significantly to NF-κB transactivation potential (reviewed in Ref. 3Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3293) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p65 at Ser-536 is proposed to be a key modification that potentiates p65 transactivation function, hence NF-κB activation (20Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Fujita F. Taniguchi Y. Kato T. Narita Y. Furuya A. Ogawa T. Sakurai H. Joh T. Itoh M. Delhase M. Karin M. Nakanishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7780-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We next tested if IKKϵ and TBK1 affect p65 phosphorylation. We tested whether ectopically expressed IKKϵ leads to phosphorylation of endogenous p65 at Ser-536. Expression of GFP-IKKϵ leads to a significantly higher level of p65 phosphorylation at the Ser-536 position (indicated as P-p65 (Ser-536)) (Fig. 4A). Utilization of GFP-tagged IKKϵ expression vector allows for distinguishing between ectopically expressed IKKϵ (GFP-IKKϵ) and endogenous IKKϵ. This experiment reveals that IKKϵ induces higher levels of endogenous IKKϵ (Fig. 4A), which has been proposed to be regulated by NF-κB (25Wang N. Ahmed S. Haqqi T.M. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 353: 118-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that ectopically expressed IKKϵ is able not only to induce phosphorylation of endogenous p65 but also to induce NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Next we examined if TBK1, an IKKϵ homolog, will also induce Ser-536 phosphorylation of p65. As shown in Fig. 4B, WT forms of both IKKϵ and TBK1 induced p65 Ser-536 phosphorylation; however, their kinase mutant forms (Lys-38 → Ala) did not lead to phosphorylation of p65. Indeed when analyzed in detail, kinase mutant forms appear to inhibit the basal level of endogenous Ser-536 phosphorylation (compare lane 1 to lanes 4 and 6). It is important to note that the phospho-p65 Ser-536 antibody specificallydetectedonlythephosphorylated form of p65 and did not crossreact with unphosphorylated p65 (see Fig. 4B). Analysis of Inducible p65 Ser-536 Phosphorylation in IKKϵ-deficient Cells—Observing that exogenous IKKϵ induces p65 phosphorylation, we hypothesized that this post-translational modification on p65 might be defective in IKKϵ-deficient MEFs in response to NF-κB inducers. To test our hypothesis, IKKϵ-deficient and IKKϵ and TBK1 doubly deficient MEFs (DKO) were stimulated with TNFα, a well known NF-κB inducer, and compared with similarly treated WT MEFs. As seen in Fig. 5A, p65 was phosphorylated at the Ser-536 position in response to TNF-α as early as 5-min post-stimulation. Interestingly, IKKϵ-deficient cells showed essentially the same pattern of phosphorylation kinetics in response to TNFα stimulation. In addition to p65 phosphorylation, IκBα degradation was also normal in IKKϵ-deficient cells compared with WT MEF cells. Analysis of β-tubulin levels confirmed that loading was essentially equivalent in all lanes (Fig. 5A). To determine if the loss of TBK1 together with IKKϵ would effect the phosphorylation of p65 and IκBα degradation, WT MEFs and MEFs deficient for both IKKϵ and TBK1 (double knock-out MEFs (DKO)) have been used under similar experimental conditions. Both p65 phosphorylation and IκBα degradation were normal in DKO MEFs (Fig. 5B). This result indicated that NF-κB activation, as measured by p65 phosphorylation and IκBα degradation in response to TNF-α, is independent of IKKϵ and TBK1. We next tested the effect of IL-1β on p65 phosphorylation as well as IκB degradation (Fig. 5C). IL-1β is, like TNF-α, a well known inducer of NF-κB. In as early as 5 min, p65 was phosphorylated maximally, however, maximal IκBα degradation was observed in 10 min. It is interesting again to observe that both p65 phosphorylation at Ser-536 and IκBα degradation were normal in IKKϵ-deficient cells compared with WT cells. In parallel studies, experiments were also performed in cells where both IKKϵ and TBK1 were deleted (DKO), and we observed no significant difference from WT cells relative to Ser-536 p65 phosphorylation or IκBα degradation after stimulation with TNF-α or IL-1β (Fig. 5D). These results suggest a minimal role of IKKϵ and TBK1 in cytokine-induced p65 phosphorylation and IκBα degradation. The pathway to NF-κB activation in response to LPS has been characterized in molecular detail resulting in the discovery of a novel family of adapter proteins, which serve to regulate and polish up toll-like receptor responses. The first identified member of this adapter family was MyD88 (26Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The importance of MyD88 in toll-like receptor signaling has been confirmed by the inability of MyD88-deficient mice to respond properly to a variety of toll-like receptor ligands, namely LPS, peptidoglycan, and bacterial CpG motifs (27Adachi O. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Tsutsui H. Sakagami M. Nakanishi K. Akira S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar, 28Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis of MyD88-deficient cells in response to LPS demonstrated the existence of MyD88-independent, late NF-κB activation, and the induction of IRF-3-dependent genes, which has recently been verified to be regulated by IKKϵ and TBK1 kinases (11Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J. Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 13McWhirter S.M. Fitzgerald K.A. Rosains J. Rowe D.C. Golenbock D.T. Maniatis T.

Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In our experimental system, LPS stimulation of WT MEFs and IKKϵ-deficient cells showed similar levels of inducible p65 phosphorylation (Fig. 5E). As expected, the kinetics of the phosphorylation upon LPS stimulation is not as fast as TNF-α and IL-1β, but the pattern of phosphorylation is similar between WT and IKKϵ-deficient cells. In addition to p65 phosphorylation, IκBα degradation was also analyzed, and there was no defect in this process. We next tested the effect of PMA stimulation on p65 phosphorylation and did not observe any difference between WT and IKKϵ-deficient MEFs (Fig. 5F). Overall our data indicate that inducible Ser-536 phosphorylation is unaffected in IKKϵ-deficient cells and confirm that IKKϵ is not significantly involved in mechanisms associated with cytokine-, LPS-, or PMA-induced IκBα degradation. IKKϵ Controls Constitutive p65 Ser-536 Phosphorylation—It was surprising to observe that IKKϵ and TBK1 expression led to the phosphorylation of endogenous p65 but that MEFs deficient for these kinases depict normal phosphorylation patterns. Because we had observed a correlation between IKKϵ and Ser-536 in certain cancer cells, we therefore hypothesized that these kinases might be involved in basal or constitutive p65 phosphorylation. Because the basal or constitutive level of p65 phosphorylation is quite low in MEF cells, the potential that IKKϵ could contribute to basal/constitutive levels of Ser-536 phosphorylation was investigated in HeLa and HEK 293T cells. These cells have higher levels of IKKϵ expression, constitutive p65 phosphorylation, and NF-κB activation compared with MEFs. To knock down IKKϵ, both plasmid-based shRNA and normal siRNA technologies have been utilized against IKKϵ mRNA. Additionally, an identical control plasmid, which contains a scrambled sequence with no homology to any known human gene product, has been utilized. Extracts from control-treated and siRNA-treated HeLa cells were analyzed for IKKϵ knockdown as well as for endogenous"
https://openalex.org/W1976583078,"We recently reported that soy isoflavones increase gene expression of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) and antioxidant defense enzymes, resulting in improved endothelial function and lower blood pressure in vivo. In this study, we establish that equol (1-100 nm) causes acute endothelium- and nitric oxide (NO)-dependent relaxation of aortic rings and rapidly (2 min) activates eNOS in human aortic and umbilical vein endothelial cells. Intracellular Ca2+ and cyclic AMP levels were unaffected by treatment (100 nm, 2 min) with equol, daidzein, or genistein. Rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/2, protein kinase B/Akt, and eNOS serine 1177 by equol was paralleled by association of eNOS with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and NO synthesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, expressing estrogen receptors (ER)α and ERβ. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and ERK1/2 inhibited eNOS activity, whereas pertussis toxin and the ER antagonists ICI 182,750 and tamoxifen had negligible effects. Our findings provide the first evidence that nutritionally relevant plasma concentrations of equol (and other soy protein isoflavones) rapidly stimulate phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, leading to the activation of NOS and increased NO production at resting cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Identification of the nongenomic mechanisms by which equol mediates vascular relaxation provides a basis for evaluating potential benefits of equol in the treatment of postmenopausal women and patients at risk of cardiovascular disease. We recently reported that soy isoflavones increase gene expression of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) and antioxidant defense enzymes, resulting in improved endothelial function and lower blood pressure in vivo. In this study, we establish that equol (1-100 nm) causes acute endothelium- and nitric oxide (NO)-dependent relaxation of aortic rings and rapidly (2 min) activates eNOS in human aortic and umbilical vein endothelial cells. Intracellular Ca2+ and cyclic AMP levels were unaffected by treatment (100 nm, 2 min) with equol, daidzein, or genistein. Rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/2, protein kinase B/Akt, and eNOS serine 1177 by equol was paralleled by association of eNOS with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and NO synthesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, expressing estrogen receptors (ER)α and ERβ. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and ERK1/2 inhibited eNOS activity, whereas pertussis toxin and the ER antagonists ICI 182,750 and tamoxifen had negligible effects. Our findings provide the first evidence that nutritionally relevant plasma concentrations of equol (and other soy protein isoflavones) rapidly stimulate phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, leading to the activation of NOS and increased NO production at resting cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Identification of the nongenomic mechanisms by which equol mediates vascular relaxation provides a basis for evaluating potential benefits of equol in the treatment of postmenopausal women and patients at risk of cardiovascular disease.

Our present findings provide the first evidence that equol (0.1-100 nm) causes rapid activation of ERK1/2 and NO release in HUVEC and HAEC at basal cytosolic Ca2+ levels and NO-dependent relaxation. Equol-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS serine 1177 was rapid (2 min) and accompanied by a dissociation of eNOS from caveolin-1 and association with Hsp90. Rapid activation of eNOS by equol was abrogated following inhibition of ERK1/2 and PI 3-kinase, and was not substantially affected by inhibitors of G protein-coupled receptors, Src family kinases, or the estrogen antagonists ICI 182,780 and tamoxifen. Endothelial Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated by collagenase digestion (1 mg ml-1) and cultured in low phenol red M199 containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum, 5 mm l-glutamine, and endothelial cell growth factor (20 μg ml-1) (35Jaffe E.A.

Human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC, Clonetics, Berkshire, UK) were initially maintained in EGM-2 medium (Clonetics) and then passaged in low phenol red M199. Detection of Estrogen Receptors ERα and ERβ—HUVEC were seeded into chamber slides and cultured overnight in M199. For light microscopy, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Fixative was replaced with 0.01 m Kreb's phosphate-buffered saline (KPBS); one group of cells was permeabilized with KPBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min to facilitate penetration of reagents and another group remained nonpermeabilized. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), cells were incubated with primary antibodies raised against the carboxyl terminus of human ERα (amino acids 582-595; Calbiochem, 0.5 μg ml-1) or human ERβ (amino acids 458-477; Zymed Laboratories Inc.; D7N, 0.5 μg/ml) for 48 h (37Hrabovszky E. Kallo I. Steinhauser A. Merchenthaler I. Coen C.W. Petersen S.L. Liposits Z. J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 473: 315-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (1:500) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Vector Laboratories), respectively, were applied as secondary antibodies for 3 h, followed by avidin-biotinylated enzyme complex for 2 h. Nickel-enhanced diamino-benzidine was used to detect the immunoreactive loci in cells. After removing the chambers, HUVEC were air-dried and cover-slipped with DEPEX. For double labeling, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min) and then placed in 0.01 m PBS followed by application of ERα and ERβ antibodies together for 48 h. Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500) were mixed and applied together for 16 h, and cells were air-dried and cover-slipped with anti-fading agent (SlowFade®, Molecular Probes). For electron microscopy, HUVEC were treated with sucrose solutions in 0.01 m KPBS (10-30% for 10 min). After three cycles of rapid freezing and thawing, cells were transferred to 10% sucrose and washed with KPBS. After blocking with 5% BSA, cells were incubated with rabbit anti-human ERα (amino acids 458-477; Zymed Laboratories Inc.; D7N, 0.5 μg/ml) for 48 h. Cells were thoroughly rinsed with KPBS and blocked with a mixture of 0.1% cold water fish gelatin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) and 1% BSA in KPBS. Nanogold goat anti-rabbit IgG, Fab′ fragment (Molecular Probes) diluted in the same blocking solution 1:100, was used for 3 h followed by glutaraldehyde fixation (1.25%) in KPBS. Cells were washed in 0.2 m sodium citrate, pH 7.5, and gold particles were silver intensified with IntenSE kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were treated with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 30 min, dehydrated in ascending series of ethanol, embedded in Durcupan ACM epoxy resin (Fluka), and polymerized at 56 °C for 2 days. Ultrathin 50-60 nm thin sections were cut using a Leica ultracut UCT ultramicrotome; ribbons were collected onto Formvar-coated single slot grids and examined with a JEOL electron microscope. Immunocytochemical controls revealed no punctate staining after processing cells without primary antibodies (Fig. 1, B and D) or when ER antibodies were pre-absorbed with peptide antigens or recombinant proteins. Single Cell [Ca2+]i Measurements—HUVEC were loaded with 1 μm fura 2-AM for 60 min in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% FCS and then maintained in HEPES-buffered balanced salt solution (36Wyatt A.W.

Fura 2-AM-loaded cells were mounted on a thermostated stage (37 °C) of a Zeiss Axiovert 135 inverted microscope with a ×40 oil immersion objective and excited alternately at 350 and 380 nm via a LEP dual filter wheel system (Ludl, Hawthorne, NY). Fluoresced light, >420 nm, was captured with a 14-bit cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu C4880-80) using Openlab software (Improvision, Coventry, UK). An image pair was captured every 1-3 s, and the ratio of fluorescence at 350 and 380 nm excitation was used as a measure of intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i. Relaxation of Isolated Aortic Rings—Thoracic aortae from male adult Wistar rats were rapidly excised, cleaned of connective tissue, and ∼2 mm rings mounted onto isometric force transducers in a jacketed (37 °C) organ bath containing Krebs-Henseleit solution (mm: NaCl 118, KCl 6, NaHCO3 25, NaH2PO4 1.2, HEPES 10, d-glucose 10, CaCl2 1.6, MgSO4 1.2, pH 7.4) gassed with 95% O2 in 5% CO2 (31Mishra S.K.

Resting tension (1 g) was applied to endothelium intact rings, and endothelial function was confirmed by relaxation of phenylephrine (PE, 1 μm) preconstricted rings to acetylcholine (10-6 m). After equilibration in buffer for 1 h, rings were pretreated with vehicle or the NOS inhibitor Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 100 μm) and constricted with 1 μm PE, and relaxation to increasing doses of equol (0.01-10 μm) was monitored. Intracellular cGMP Accumulation—Basal and stimulated cGMP levels were determined by radioimmunoassay, with inhibition of cGMP accumulation by l-NAME (100 μm, 15 min) serving as an index of NO production (36Wyatt A.W.

Confluent monolayers were washed twice with warmed Krebs-Henseleit buffer and then preincubated for 15 min with buffer containing l-arginine (100 μm) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, 500 μm). Cells were then stimulated (30 s to 15 min) with 1-100 nm equol, daidzein, or genistein in the presence of IBMX and l-arginine (100 μm), and responses were compared with E2 or E2 conjugated to bovine albumin (E2-BSA). In other experiments, cells were pretreated with inhibitors of PI 3-kinase ([2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-4-one hydrochloride], LY294,002, 10 μm, 30 min), MEK1/2 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis-[aminophenylthio]butadiene, U0126, 1 μm, 30 min), Src kinase (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7(t-butyl)pyrazolo-[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2, 10 μm, 30 min), pertussis toxin (100 ng ml-1, 120 min), or the estrogen receptor antagonists ICI 182,780 (10 μm, 30 min) and tamoxifen (10 μm, 60 min). Pretreated cells were then stimulated acutely with isoflavones or E2 in the presence of l-arginine (100 μm) and IBMX (0.5 mm) and vehicle or inhibitor(s). Prostacyclin (PGI2) release into the supernatant was analyzed by radioimmunoassay of 6-keto-PGF1α, the stable metabolite of PGI2 (36Wyatt A.W. Steinert J.R. Wheeler-Jones C.P. Morgan A.J. Sugden D.

Immunoblotting Phosphorylated ERK1/2, Akt, and eNOS Ser1177— HUVEC were equilibrated in M199 containing 1% FCS for 4 h and then preincubated with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing l-arginine (100 μm) and IBMX (0.5 mm). In other experiments, HUVEC were pretreated with vehicle or U0126 (1 μm, 30 min) or LY294,002 (10 μm, 30 min) and then stimulated for 30 s to 5 min with equol, using thrombin (1 unit/ml, 2 min) as an internal control. We reported previously (36Wyatt A.W. Steinert J.R. Wheeler-Jones C.P. Morgan A.J. Sugden D. Pearson J.D. Sobrevia L. Mann G.E. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1584-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) that the structurally distinct MEK1/2 inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 do not have inhibitory effects on p38MAPK or c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways in HUVEC. Reactions were stopped with ice-cold PBS containing 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were electrotransferred onto polyvinyldifluoride membranes and then probed with a polyclonal antibody against dually phosphorylated (threonine 183/tyrosine 185) ERK1/2 or phosphospecific antibodies against Akt or eNOS serine 1177. Protein bands were detected by ECL, and densitometric analyses were performed using Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). Immunoprecipitation of eNOS, Association with Hsp90, and Dissociation from Caveolin-1—HUVEC in T75 culture flasks were equilibrated in M199 containing 1% FCS for 4 h prior to treatment for 2 min with equol (100 nm) or thrombin (1 unit ml-1) in Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing l-arginine (100 μm) and IBMX (0.5 mm). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and cell lysates were collected in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with ExactaCruz immunoprecipitation matrix (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) precoated with an eNOS antibody. Immobilized immune complexes were washed twice with RIPA buffer, eluted from the matrix by boiling for 5 min in SDS lysis buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using antibodies against eNOS, caveolin-1, and Hsp90. Cell Culture Reagents and Materials—All cell culture reagents, collagenase type II from Clostridium histolyticum,E2, E2-BSA, histamine, thrombin, IBMX, rolipram, l-NAME, ICI 182,780, tamoxifen, and pertussis toxin were obtained from Sigma; equol was from Apin Chemicals Ltd. (UK); daidzein and genistein were from Alexis Biochemicals; fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura2-AM) was from Molecular Probes (Cambridge Bioscience, UK); U0126, LY294,002, and antibodies against ERK1/2 were from Promega (Southampton, UK); antibodies against eNOS, Hsp90, and caveolin-1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and α-tubulin was from Chemicon. ECL reagents, cyclic AMP, 125I-labeled 3′,5′-cyclic GMP, and prostacyclin EIA kits were from Amersham Biosciences. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. of measurements in 3-7 different endothelial cell cultures. Statistical analysis was performed by use of analysis of variance followed by a Student's t test, and a level of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Intracellular Localization of ERα and ERβ in HUVEC—Mild fixation and permeabilization with Triton X-100 were used to detect ERα or ERβ immunoreactivity within the nucleus of HUVEC (Fig. 1, A and C), with staining absent when the primary antibody was omitted (Fig. 1, B and D). Stronger fixation of cells not treated with Triton X-100 showed lower signal intensity within the nucleus, but immunoreactive loci were preserved throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, E and F). Doubly labeled immunofluorescence showed ERα and ERβ reactivity in different loci of the cell (Fig. 1, G and H), and electron microscopy revealed ERβ reactivity in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells, with a few immunoreactive loci also detected at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, I and J). Acute Effects of Equol and Histamine on Mobilization of [Ca2+]i—To examine whether equol acutely alters [Ca2+]i in human endothelial cells, fura 2-AM (1 μm)-loaded HUVEC were challenged for 2 min with equol and then histamine. As shown in Fig. 1K, equol (10 or 100 nm) failed to elevate [Ca2+]i, whereas histamine (100 μm) evoked a classical biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i (36Wyatt A.W. Steinert J.R. Wheeler-Jones C.P.

Similar responses were observed following acute (2 min) application of 17β-estradiol (data not shown), confirming previous findings in HUVEC (16Caulin-Glaser T. Garcia-Cardena G. Sarrel P. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Equol Causes Rapid Endothelium- and NO-dependent Relaxation—Endothelium intact aortic rings were preconstricted with PE (1 μm) and exposed to cumulative doses of equol. As shown in representative original records (Fig. 2, A and B), equol caused a dose-dependent relaxation that was inhibited by pretreatment with l-NAME (100 μm). Fig. 2C summarizes the results from three different animals. Isoflavones Do Not Acutely Increase cAMP or PGI2 Release— Treatment of HAEC (data not shown) or HUVEC for 2 min with 100 nm equol, daidzein, or genistein had no significant effect on intracellular cAMP levels or PGI2 production, whereas forskolin and histamine increased cAMP levels and PGI2 production, respectively (Table 1).TABLE 1Acute effects of equol, daidzein, and genistein on intracellular cAMP levels or PGI2 production in HUVEC Confluent cells were preincubated with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram (10 μm) and then stimulated for 2 min with 100 nm equol, daidzein, or genistein, using forskolin (1 μm, 2 min) and histamine (10 μm, 5 min) as positive controls for cAMP or PGI2 production, respectively.

Treatment with isoflavones (100 nm) led to a rapid (2 min) phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 3, A and C) in both cell types, and densitometric analyses of different cell cultures are shown in Fig. 3, B and D. We reported previously that activation of A2a-purinoceptors results in rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and NO production in HUVEC independent of detectable increases in cytosolic Ca2+ (36Wyatt A.W.

To examine whether equol, daidzein, or genistein also acutely stimulate NO synthesis in endothelial cells, we treated HUVEC and HAEC with these isoflavones (100 nm, 2 min) and measured changes in intracellular cGMP accumulation in the absence or presence of l-NAME (100 μm). Equol, daidzein, and genistein (and E2) evoked rapid increases in cGMP accumulation, which were inhibited by l-NAME (Fig. 3E). We then further examined concentration- and time-dependent actions of equol on ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cGMP accumulation in HUVEC. ERK1/2 was phosphorylated by equol concentrations as low as 1 nm (data not shown), with phosphorylation at higher concentrations (100 nm) detected within 30 s and maintained for up to 5 min (Fig. 4, A and B). Activation of ERK1/2 was paralleled by an increase in intracellular cGMP, with maximal NO release achieved at 2 min (Fig. 4C). All subsequent experiments were performed using 100 nm isoflavones or E2. Preincubation of HUVEC with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (1 μm, 30min) abolished ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to acute treatment with 100 nm equol, daidzein, genistein, or E2 (Fig. 5A), with similar findings observed in HAEC (data not shown). Under the same experimental conditions, U0126 (1 μm) abrogated equol-, daidzein-, genistein-, and E2-stimulated increases in cGMP accumulation (Fig. 5B).

https://openalex.org/W2101615512,"NF kappa B (NF-kappaB) is a ubiquitous transcription factor activated by various stimuli implicated in heart failure progression including reactive oxygen species (ROS), hypoxia, and inflammatory cytokines. Although NF-kappaB is involved in ischemic preconditioning, unstable angina pectoris, and atherogenesis, its role in heart failure has not been determined. Therefore, we investigated left ventricular remodeling in mice with a targeted deletion of the NF-kappaB subunit p50/NF-kappaB1 after myocardial infarction.p50 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) animals underwent coronary artery ligation. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed at days 0, 21, and 56 at midpapillary levels. Early mortality was significantly lower in KO than in WT animals. Moreover, p50 KOs exhibited significantly reduced ventricular dilatation over 8 wk compared to WT controls (end-systolic diameters by transthoracic echocardiography, WT vs. KO, 0.55+/-0.04 vs. 0.34+/-0.03 cm) and preserved left ventricular contractility. Collagen content and matrixmetalloproteinase (MMP) -9 expression were significantly lower in KO mice after myocardial infarction and may account for improved left ventricular remodeling.Absence of the NF-kappaB subunit p50 improves early survival and reduces left ventricular dilatation after myocardial infarction. NF-kappaB might therefore be an attractive target to treat heart failure."

Such patterns are common today in wild populations of long-lived birds and mammals. Factors such as predation and entrance into the breeding population may have influenced tyrannosaur survivorship. This survivorship pattern can explain the rarity of juvenile specimens in museum collections."

The attachment of the new material occurred by transpeptidation reactions in which monomeric triand tetrapeptides in the sacculi were the acceptors. Most bacteria have a murein (peptidoglycan) sacculus that forms an uninterrupted net-like structure around the cytoplasmic membrane. The sacculus is essential for the osmotic stability of the cell (1Weidel W. Pelzer H. Adv. Enzymol. 1964; 26: 193-232PubMed Google Scholar) and consists of glycan strands that are cross-linked by short peptides (2Höltje J.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 181-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During growth and division, the sacculus is enlarged by the incorporation of lipid II precursor by a yet unknown mechanism, which involves the coordinated action of murein synthases, murein hydrolases, and probably regulatory proteins (3Vollmer W. Höltje J.V. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli contains six known murein synthases (4Goffin C. Ghuysen J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

However, it is not known what particular reaction these enzymes catalyze during the enlargement of the sacculus and, hence, which precise function they have in cell wall growth. Furthermore, most of the murein synthases from E. coli and other species are poorly or not characterized so far, perhaps because of difficulties in obtaining pure enzyme and lipid II substrate in sufficient quantities. The penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 2The abbreviations used are: PBP, penicillin-binding protein; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TG, transglycosylase; TP, transpeptidase.2The abbreviations used are: PBP, penicillin-binding protein; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TG, transglycosylase; TP, transpeptidase. PBP1A and PBP1B are the major bifunctional murein synthases in E. coli catalyzing both the oligomerization of the glycan strands and the formation of the peptide cross-links (9Kato J. Suzuki H. Hirota Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 196: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10Nakagawa J. Matsuhashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Both PBPs form independent dimers in vivo (12Charpentier X. Chalut C. Remy M.H. Masson J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3749-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PBP1A and PBP1B are not essential for cell growth, but cells lacking both enzymes are not viable, indicating that both have a similar, essential function that cannot be taken over by other murein synthases (5Suzuki H. Nishimura Y. Hirota Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 13Spratt B.G. Jobanputra V. FEBS Lett. 1977; 79: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Yet, mutants lacking either PBP1A or PBP1B show particular phenotypes, indicating that these synthases may play distinct roles during cell growth and division. For example, mutants without PBP1B are more sensitive to β-lactam antibiotics than mutants without PBP1A (14Yousif S.Y. Broome-Smith J.K. Spratt B.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 2839-2845PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PBP1B-deficient mutants, but not PBP1A-deficient mutants, lose cell integrity upon inactivation of PBP2, PBP3, or the cell division protein FtsQ (15Garcia del Portillo F. de Pedro M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5863-5870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activities of PBP1B with lipid II or artificial substrates have been studied previously (16Terrak M. Ghosh T.K. van Heijenoort J. Van Beeumen J. Lampilas M. Aszodi J. Ayala J.A. Ghuysen J.M. Nguyen-Disteche M. Mol.

Commun. 1982; 106: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the activities of PBP1A remain uncharacterized. In this article, we report that PBP1A is capable of producing in vitro a cross-linked murein with glycan strands of (on average) almost 20 disaccharide units and with 18–26% of the peptides being part of cross-links. We have also studied the specificity of the PBP1A-catalyzed transpeptidation reaction. For the first time, we could demonstrate in vitro an attachment of nascent murein to isolated murein sacculi by a murein synthase, namely by PBP1A. E. coli Strains and Growth Conditions—XL1-Blue (Stratagene) and BL21(DE3) (Novagen) were used for cloning and PBP1A overproduction, respectively. All experiments were performed in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. Kanamycin (50 μg/ml) was added to strains carrying overexpression plasmids.

Cloning of a mrcA Expression Plasmid—The mrcA gene encoding for PBP1A (GenBank™ accession no. AAA58193) was amplified by PCR from chromosomal DNA from E. coli wild type MC1061 using the primers 1A_up (5′-GGACGAATTCCCAAATGAAACTAAATGGG-3′) and 1A_down (5′-ATTGGATCCATCAGAACAATTCCTGTGCC-3′). The PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into the plasmid pJFK118EH (26Bishop R.E. Weiner J.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 114: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), resulting in pTK1A. This plasmid was used as template in a PCR for the amplification of the mrcA gene with the primers PBP1Ahis_up (5′-GCGGCTAGCATGAAACTAAATGGGAAAT-3′) and PBP1Ahis_down (5′-CCTGAATTCATCAGAACAATTCCTGTGC-3′). After digestion with NheI and EcoRI, the fragment was cloned into the overexpression plasmid pET28a(+) (Novagen), resulting in pTK1Ahis. The correctness of the mrcA sequence in pTK1Ahis was confirmed by sequencing. Site-directed Mutagenesis—For the production of PBP1A-(TG*), with a Glu94 → Gln exchange in the first transglycosylase motif, pTK1Ahis was changed by site-directed mutagenesis using the primers 1A-TG*_up (5′-AGCCTTTATCGCGACACAAGACAGCCGCTTCTACG-3′) and 1A-TG*_-down (5′-TCGTAGAAGCGGCTGTCTTGTGTCGCGATAAAGGC-3′). For the purification of PBP1A(TP*), with a Ser473 → Ala exchange in the first transpeptidase motif, pTK1Ahis was changed by site-directed mutagenesis using the primers 1A-TP*_up (5′-TGCGTCAGGTGGGTGCCAACATCAAACCGTTCC-3′) and 1A-TP*_down (5′-AACGGTTTGATGTTGGCACCCACCTGACGCAGTGC-3′). Mutagenesis was performed according to the protocol of the manufacturer employing the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The correct sequences of the inserts in the resulting plasmids, pTK1Ahis(TG*) and pTK1Ahis(TP*), were confirmed. Preparation of Cell Extracts—For the overproduction of the His-tagged form of the PBP1A variants, E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying the appropriate overexpression plasmid was grown in 4 liters of LB medium at 30 °C until an optical density (578 nm) of 0.3 was reached. The cells were induced with 0.05 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Gerbu, Gailberg, Germany). After 90 min of further growth, the cells were chilled on ice for 10 min and harvested by centrifugation (4200 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of 25 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.5. After addition of DNase and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, the cells were broken in a French pressure cell at 700 psi. After centrifugation (62,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C), the pellet was resuspended in 25 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 1 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, pH 7.5, and stirred for 2 h at 6 °C. After another centrifugation (see above), the pellet was resuspended with 20 ml of 25 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 1 m NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, pH 7.5 (buffer A), and stirred for 18 h at 6 °C. The supernatant obtained after a third centrifugation (see above) contained the solubilized membrane proteins. Purification of PBP1A Variants—The purification was performed in two chromatography steps. First, 20 ml of membrane extract (see above) was incubated with 2 ml of washed and equilibrated Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow beads (Qiagen) for 2 h at 6°C. The beads were spun down (4200 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) and washed twice with buffer A containing 5 mm imidazole. His-tagged PBP1A variants were eluted with buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole for 30 min at 6 °C. The eluate was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5, for 4 h. For the removal of the His tag, 16 units of thrombin (restriction grade, Novagen) were added, and dialysis continued for 16–20 h. Then the sample was dialyzed for 1.5 h against 2 liters of buffer I (10 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 4.8) and for 16 h against buffer I containing 200 mm NaCl. The sample was diluted 1-fold with 10 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, pH 4.8, and the protein was purified on a 1-ml HiTrap SP HP column (GE Healthcare) in a 20-ml gradient from 100 mm NaCl and 0.2% Triton X-100 to 1 m NaCl and 0.2% Triton X-100. The PBP1A-containing fractions were dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5, and stored at –74 °C. The recombinant PBP1A obtained after removal of the His tag has an N-terminal extension of six amino acids and has the following sequence, GSHMAS-PBP1A(M1-F858). β-Lactam Binding (PBP Assay)—β-Lactam binding was assayed with biotinylated ampicillin as described previously (27Dargis M. Malouin F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Transglycosylation and Transpeptidation Reaction of PBP1A with Lipid II—Lipid II (1.2 nmol, 11,000 dpm) was vacuum dried and dissolved in 5 μl of methanol. The reaction was performed in a total volume of 50 μl in 25 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.5 (buffer B), with 0.5–0.8 μm PBP1A variant. In different experiments, the precursor UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide, UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide, or UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was added 1 mm. In one experiment, the transpeptidation domain of PBP1A was blocked with 50 μg/ml penicillin G. The reaction was performed for 1 h at 30°C. The pH of the samples was adjusted to 4.8 prior to boiling for 5 min followed by a digestion with 50 μg/ml cellosyl for 1 h at 37°C and boiling for 5 min. Time Course Experiments—In a total volume of 325 μl in buffer B, lipid II (24 μm) and PBP1A (0.8 μm) were incubated at 30 °C. At different time points (0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min), 50 μl-aliquots were taken and boiled for 5 min. The samples were chilled on ice, and cellosyl digestion was done as described above. In a second experiment, glycan strands with monomeric peptide side chains were preformed with PBP1A(TP*) in a total volume of 425 μl for 1 h. The sample was boiled for 10 min, and PBP1A (0.8 μm) was added followed by an incubation for 10 min on ice. After the addition of lipid II (24 μm), the time course experiment was performed as described above. Attachment of Newly Synthesized Material to Sacculi—PBP1A (0.8 μm) was preincubated for 10 min on ice with 0.5 mg/ml murein sacculi (isolated from MC1061) in buffer B. Lipid II (4.8 μm) was added, and the reaction proceeded in a final volume of 100 μl for 1 h at 30°C. The sacculi were sedimented by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min), and the pellet was washed twice with 200 μl of buffer A containing 0.2% Triton X-100. The pellet samples were digested for 18 h at 37 °C with 35 μg/ml cellosyl. The radioactivity of each sample (digested pellet, two wash fractions, and supernatant) was determined by scintillation counting. For HPLC analysis, the reaction was performed in a final volume of 200 μl. PBP1A (0.8 μm) was incubated for 10 min on ice with or without 1 mg/ml sacculi (from MC1061). Lipid II (12 μm) was added, and the reaction was performed for 1 h at 30 °C. After sedimentation (14,000 × g, 10 min), the pellets were washed twice with 200 μl of buffer A containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and resuspended in 200 μl of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.8. The pH of the supernatant and of the washes was adjusted to 4.8, and the samples were digested with 17.5 μg/ml cellosyl for 18 h at 37 °C. Samples were boiled for 5 min. Analysis of the Reaction Products—Prior to HPLC analysis, the samples were reduced with NaBH4 as described (28Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The reaction products were separated by HPLC according to a published method (25Glauner B. Höltje J.V. Schwarz U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10088-10095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), using a radioactivity flow-through detector (Canberra). The separated muropeptides were identified by their retention times with the help of muropeptide standards (19Bertsche U. Breukink E. Kast T. Vollmer W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38096-38101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Compound 1 (Fig. 4C) could be dephosphorylated to compound 2 either by extended boiling or by treatment with an acidic phosphatase followed by reduction with NaBH4 (19Bertsche U. Breukink E. Kast T. Vollmer W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38096-38101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PBP1A belongs to the class A PBPs and is anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane via a (predicted) transmembrane helix (amino acids 14–34). Most of the enzyme (amino acids 35–858) is located in the periplasm, where it contains a transglycosylase and a transpeptidase domain. The modular domain organization of PBP1A is similar to that of PBP1B (Fig. 1). The five typical signature motifs in the transglycosylase domain and the three signature motifs in the transpeptidase domain were present in both enzymes. In PBP1B, Glu233 and Ser510 are essential for transglycosylation and transpeptidation activity, respectively (16Terrak M. Ghosh T.K. van Heijenoort J. Van Beeumen J. Lampilas M. Aszodi J. Ayala J.A.

To study the enzymatic reactions of PBP1A, we cloned pET28a(+)-based expression plasmids for the purification of PBP1A and of two variants with single amino acid exchanges, PBP1A(TG*) with a Glu94 → Gln exchange and PBP1A(TP*) with a Ser473 → Ala exchange. Purification involved the preparation of membrane fraction, Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography, cleavage of the N-terminal oligo-histidine tag by thrombin, and cation exchange chromatography. Fig. 2 shows the purified proteins and a β-lactam binding assay. As expected, PBP1A and PBP1A(TG*), but not PBP1A(TP*), bound biotinylated ampicillin. The activities of the PBP1A variants were studied with radioactive lipid II substrate employing a recently developed in vitro murein synthesis assay (Fig. 3; see Ref. 19Bertsche U. Breukink E. Kast T. Vollmer W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38096-38101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar for a scheme). Briefly, boiling of lipid II yielded the phosphorylated disaccharide pentapeptide (Fig. 4C, compound 1). Because of partial dephosphorylation during the boiling and reduction steps, a small fraction (0–15%) of nonphosphorylated disaccharide pentapeptide was formed. Upon reaction with a transglycosylase, glycan strands were produced. Digestion with cellosyl and boiling yielded nonphosphorylated disaccharide pentapeptide (Fig. 4C, compound 2) and phosphorylated disaccharide pentapeptide, the latter originating from glycan chain ends and nonreacted lipid II. If a transpeptidase is present, the procedure also yields a dimeric (cross-linked) muropeptide, the bisdisaccharide tetrapentapeptide (Fig. 4C, compound 3). PBP1A oligomerized glycan strands with an average length of 19.6 disaccharide units and formed peptide cross-links (Fig. 3). In different experiments, between 18 and 26% of the peptides became part of cross-links. PBP1A(TP*) produced glycan strands with an average of 10.4 disaccharide units and completely lacked peptide cross-linking activity, as did PBP1A that was blocked with penicillin G. PBP1A(TG*) did not produce glycan strands and did not form peptide cross-links. The specificity of the transpeptidation reaction was studied by adding to the reaction of PBP1A with lipid II a 42-fold molar excess (over lipid II) of artificial substrates, the murein precursors UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide, UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide, or UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (Fig. 4). Addition of the UDP compounds almost completely prevented cross-linking reactions between the two lipid II molecules, as demonstrated by the small fraction of the normal bisdisaccharide tetrapentapeptide (Fig. 4, compound 3). PBP1A could use tri-, tetra-, and pentapeptide substrates as acceptors in transpeptidation reactions, leading to the formation of “mixed” transpeptidation products (Fig. 4C, compounds 4, 5, and 6). As expected, the formation of the mixed compound 4 (Fig. 4C) could be completely prevented by the preincubation of PBP1A with penicillin G, and compound 4 was not formed from lipid II and UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide by PBP1A(TP*) (data not shown). Subsequently, we studied the time course of the reaction of PBP1A with lipid II. Strikingly, only transglycosylation (but not transpeptidation) occurred within the first 15 min of the reaction under consumption of ∼25% of the available lipid II (Fig. 5A) and with a rate of lipid II consumption of ∼0.75 mol/(mol PBP1A · min). Between 15 and 60 min, transglycosylation and transpeptidation reactions proceeded until almost all lipid II was consumed. Peptide cross-links were formed at a rate of ∼0.06 mol/(mol PBP1A · min). The absence of initial transpeptidation activity indicates that PBP1A requires the presence of oligomerized glycan strands carrying monomeric peptides for cross-linking activity. Therefore, the time course experiment was repeated but this time in the presence of oligomerized glycan strands that had been preformed from lipid II by PBP1A(TP*). Indeed, if glycan strands with monomeric peptides were present, the transpeptidation reaction started immediately, with cross-links being formed with a rate of ∼0.06 mol/(mol PBP1A · min) (Fig. 5B). The time course experiments indicated that polymeric murein and not lipid II precursor could be the preferred acceptor for the PBP1A-catalyzed cross-linking reactions. Therefore, we tested in a pull-down experiment whether PBP1A was able to attach newly synthesized murein to isolated sacculi (Fig. 6). In the absence of murein sacculi, the reaction product of PBP1A and lipid II was not sedimented by centrifugation (Fig. 6, sample B). In the presence of sacculi, ∼25% of the total radioactivity sedimented together with the sacculi (Fig. 6, sample C), indicating that a fraction of the newly synthesized murein had been covalently attached to the sacculi. No attachment to sacculi occurred with PBP1A(TG*) or with PBP1A(TP*) (Fig. 6, samples D and E). The PBP1A-catalyzed attachment of new material to sacculi could be blocked with penicillin G (Fig. 6, sample F), suggesting that the attachment occurred via transpeptidation reactions. To determine the structure(s) of the attachment site(s), the reaction products were sedimented by centrifugation, and the supernatant, as well as the sedimented murein sacculi, was digested with cellosyl followed by reduction and HPLC analysis (Fig. 7). The reaction of PBP1A and lipid II was performed in the presence and absence of murein sacculi. In the absence of murein sacculi (Fig. 7A, left two bars), 98.1% of the radioactivity was present in the supernatant, and the produced murein had an average glycan strand length of 18.2 disaccharide units, with 26.4% of the peptides being part of cross-links. In the presence of murein sacculi (Fig. 7A, right two bars), ∼44% of the total radioactivity was sedimented together with the sacculi, and ∼56% of the total radioactivity was present in the supernatant. HPLC analysis revealed a different muropeptide composition in the supernatant and in the pellet (Fig. 7B); the quantification of the respective compounds is depicted in C. The supernatant (Fig. 7B, chromatogram III) contained a similar muropeptide profile as the sample without murein sacculi (chromatogram I), except that the average glycan strand length was decreased to 6.1 disaccharide units. In the pellet, the average glycan strand length was >40 disaccharide units, and it contained additional radioactive cross-linked compounds (Fig. 7B, chromatogram IV), the bisdisaccharide tetratripeptide and the bisdisaccharide tetratetrapeptide. These compounds could only be produced by cross-linking reactions between new pentapeptides (from radioactive lipid II) as donors and monomeric tri- and tetrapeptides in the sacculi as acceptors. Thus, the attachment of new material to sacculi by PBP1A occurred by transpeptidation reactions with monomeric (and not with cross-linked dimeric or trimeric) acceptors. PBP1A formed in vitro a cross-linked, oligomeric murein from lipid II precursor. As predicted from sequence comparison (Fig. 1), the Glu94 and Ser473 residues are essential for the catalytic activities. Although the PBP1A(TP*) variant with inactive transpeptidase domain could still catalyze transglycosylation reactions, a PBP1A(TG*) variant with inactive transglycosylase domain lacked both transglycosylase and transpeptidase activities. Similar observations have been made with inactive variants of PBP1B from E. coli (16Terrak M. Ghosh T.K. van Heijenoort J. Van Beeumen J. Lampilas M. Aszodi J. Ayala J.A. Ghuysen J.M. Nguyen-Disteche M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 350-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Transpeptidation by PBP1A(TG*) occurred neither in the presence of an oligomeric reaction product produced by PBP1A(TP*) nor in a reaction mixture containing PBP1A(TG*), PBP1A(TP*), and lipid II (data not shown). Therefore, it is possible that the transpeptidase domain of PBP1A is activated by ongoing transglycosylation reactions and that the cross-linking occurs preferentially with pentapeptide donors in the glycan strands produced by the transglycosylase domain. The time course experiments of the reaction of PBP1A with lipid II revealed that the cross-linking reaction was delayed and started only after glycan strands with monomeric pentapeptides had been produced by transglycosylation. If such material was added initially to PBP1A and lipid II, formation of cross-links started immediately and proceeded until 21% of the newly added peptides became part of cross-links. On the other hand, only 2% of the peptides became part of cross-links if oligomerized glycan strands were incubated with PBP1A alone (without lipid II) for 60 min (not shown). Apparently, transpeptidation requires ongoing transglycosylation (see above) and, in addition, the presence of oligomerized glycan strands carrying monomeric peptides. Either binding of the enzyme to this oligomeric material activates the transpeptidase function or the oligomeric material is a substrate for the transpeptidation reaction (or both possibilities). We have obtained evidence that monomeric peptides in high molecular weight murein function as acceptors in PBP1A-catalyzed cross-linking reactions. First, a fraction of newly synthesized murein was covalently attached to murein sacculi, and this attachment was inhibited by penicillin G, an inhibitor of the transpeptidation reaction (Fig. 6). Second, we identified dimeric muropeptides with tetratripeptide and tetratetrapeptide cross-links as products, proving that cross-linking reactions had occurred between pentapeptides (from lipid II and/or newly synthesized glycan strands) as donors and tri- and tetrapeptides in the sacculi as acceptors (Fig. 7). The observed cross-linking reactions of PBP1A, with acceptor peptides in nascent murein or in murein sacculi, are depicted schematically in Fig. 8. Interestingly, the formation of cross-links between nascent murein and sacculi did not take place at the expense of the formation of cross-links between new (pentapeptide) donors and acceptors; in the presence of sacculi, ∼23% of the peptides became part of tetrapentapeptide cross-links (in the attached material), which was only slightly less than in the murein produced in the absence of sacculi (∼26%) (Fig. 7). In this experiment, a total of ∼30% of the pentapeptides (originating from lipid II) had participated as donors in transpeptidation reactions, of which 11.5% reacted with pentapeptides (in lipid II) and 19% with tri- and tetrapeptides (in sacculi) as acceptors. PBP1A and PBP1B are similar in their in vitro activities in that both can use artificial tri-, tetra-, and pentapeptides (in UDP-linked precursors) as acceptors for transpeptidation reactions (19Bertsche U. Breukink E. Kast T. Vollmer W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38096-38101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Such reactions have been observed before in ether-permeabilized cells (29Kraus W. Glauner B. Höltje J.V. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1000-1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kraus W. Höltje J.-V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, PBP1A and PBP1B are different with respect to several properties. (i) The transglycosylation and transpeptidation rates were significantly higher for PBP1B. (ii) Under optimum condition, PBP1B produced a murein with almost 50% of the peptides being present in cross-links. With PBP1A, we observed a maximum of 26% of the peptides becoming part of cross-links. (iii) PBP1B produced a trimeric compound by cross-linkage of a pentapeptide donor and a tetrapentapeptide acceptor. A previous study reported the production of a trimeric cross-linked product by PBP1A (21Tomioka S. Ishino F. Tamaki S. Matsuhashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have observed in some experiments the formation of a putative trimeric product only in small quantities (Fig. 7B, chromatogram I, see peak at 100 min). It is possible that the differences in the enzyme preparation methods and, hence, in the purities of the enzyme account for this discrepancy. (iv) Although both PBP1A and PBP1B required the presence of Triton X-100 for solubilization, the activities of PBP1A, but not of PBP1B, significantly decreased if the concentrations of the detergent exceeded 0.2% (data not shown). (v) PBP1B was most active as a dimer, whereas dimerization of purified PBP1A was not observed. (vi) Unlike in the case of PBP1A, time course experiments did not reveal a preference of PBP1B for polymerized murein glycan strands with monomeric peptides as acceptors for the transpeptidation reaction. In addition, we have observed that PBP1B attached a significantly smaller fraction of nascent murein to sacculi in vitro as compared with PBP1A (data not shown). It is possible that differences in the activities of both enzymes account for the different phenotypes of mutants lacking either PBP1A or PBP1B (see the Introduction). For the first time, we could demonstrate in vitro an attachment of nascent murein to sacculi, a reaction that occurs in living cells during the growth of the sacculus. Similar to our in vitro experiments, it has been shown that incorporation of new material in vivo involves the formation of new cross-links; during cell division, cross-links are formed mainly between two new peptides, whereas during cell elongation, cross-links are also formed between new peptides and peptides in the existing sacculus (31Burman L.G.

In vitro, PBP1A most likely attached new material without increasing the surface of the sacculi. The enlargement of the sacculus in vivo is a more complex process and presumably requires a coordinated interplay between different bifunctional and monofunctional murein synthases, murein hydrolases, and regulatory proteins. The precise role of PBP1A in the enlargement of the sacculus during cell elongation and division remains to be determined. Our results indicate that PBP1A might synthesize patches of nascent murein and attach them to the sacculus. We thank Ute Bertsche for a critical reading of the manuscript."

The tripeptide antioxidant glutathione (GSH; γ-glutamyl-cysteinylglycine) is one of the most abundant cellular thiols. It protects cells against oxidative damage from reactive oxygen species, maintains cellular redox status, promotes cell growth, and plays a crucial role in the detoxification of xenobiotics. GSH can directly scavenge free radicals, act as an antioxidant in GSH-mediated reduction of peroxides and act as a co-substrate for glutathione S-transferase-mediated detoxification of reactive intermediates formed during phase I metabolism (1Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5947) Google Scholar).

APAP overdose is responsible for nearly 50% of the acute liver failure cases in the United States (6Lee W.M. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 6-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and is thus of high public health concern. APAP metabolism has been well defined, making it a good model for drug-induced liver toxicity. APAP is primarily metabolized through sulfation and glucuronidation pathways (7Nelson S.D. Semin. Liver Dis. 1990; 10: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 8James L.P. Mayeux P.R. Hinson J.A. Drug Metab.

However, a fraction of APAP is bioactivated by cytochrome P-450s to n-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), which can bind to cellular proteins (3Jaeschke H. Gores G.J. Cederbaum A.I. Hinson J.A.

NAPQI also covalently binds to GSH and is either converted back to APAP, or forms the non-toxic APAP-GSH conjugate. APAP overdose results in depletion of hepatic GSH (by as much as 90%) (2Mitchell J.R. Jollow D.J. Potter W.Z. Gillette J.R. Brodie B.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1973; 187: 211-217PubMed Google Scholar). As GSH stores are depleted, increased levels of NAPQI-protein adducts form, and such adducts are thought to be an important contributor to APAP hepatotoxicity (3Jaeschke H. Gores G.J. Cederbaum A.I.

N-Acetylcysteine given soon after APAP (within 1-2 h) is highly protective against liver injury. However, this protection rapidly diminishes with time. Nonetheless, even when given as much as 2 h post-APAP administration, N-acetylcysteine affords some protection against hepatotoxicity (7Nelson S.D. Semin. Liver Dis. 1990; 10: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In most tissues, the two-step biosynthesis of GSH is primarily limited by the activity of glutamate-cysteine ligase that carries out the first and rate-limiting step in GSH synthesis (13Griffith O.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 922-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Glutamate-cysteine ligase is a heterodimeric enzyme composed of catalytic (Gclc) and modifier (Gclm) subunits. All catalytic functions of the holoenzyme are carried out by Gclc, whereas Gclm influences the catalytic efficiency of Gclc by lowering the Km for glutamate and increasing the Ki for GSH feedback inhibition. To investigate the influence of GSH biosynthesis capacity on the extent of hepatotoxicant-induced injury we developed transgenic mice that conditionally overexpress Gclc, Gclm, or both subunits. Our initial attempts to generate constitutively expressing glutamate-cysteine ligase transgenic mice using either the cytomegalovirus or metallothionein promoters to drive increased glutamate-cysteine ligase subunit mRNA expression yielded small litter sizes and no transgene positive progeny. These results suggested that glutamate-cysteine ligase overexpression was incompatible with normal fetal development. Utilizing the liver-specific transactivator GLVP (14Wang Y. DeMayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) we have successfully generated transgenic mice that conditionally overexpress Gclc, Gclm, or both transgenes. In this model system, mifepristone (also known as RU486), a progesterone antagonist, binds to the transgene-derived chimeric GLVP transactivator protein, causing it to translocate to the nucleus, where it binds to and transactivates target glutamate-cysteine ligase transgenes. Glutamate-cysteine ligase is variably expressed in humans (15O'Dwyer P.J. Szarka C.E. Yao K.S. Halbherr T.C. Pfeiffer G.R. Green F. Gallo J.M. Brennan J. Frucht H. Goosenberg E.B. Hamilton T.C.

Because GSH plays such an important role in detoxifying APAP, variation in glutamate-cysteine ligase expression may play a role in idiosyncratic reactions to APAP. This transgenic mouse model of inducible glutamate-cysteine ligase overexpression allowed us to directly test the hypothesis that glutamate-cysteine ligase expression influences susceptibility to APAP-induced liver injury.

The Gclc and Gclm amino acid coding regions plus polyadenylation fragments were amplified from Gclc/pCR3.1 or Gclm/pCR3.1 using primers having a 5′ BamHI (CACTATAGGGGGATCCAAGCTGGCTAGCGTTTA-5′ BamHI/pCR3.1) and a 3′ KpnI (GCCACTGGTACCTTCCGCCTCAGAAGCCAT-3′ KpnI/pCR3.1) restriction site. The resulting amplicons were digested with BamHI and KpnI and used to replace the BglII/KpnI CAT fragment of p17 × 4-tk-CAT. The glutamate-cysteine ligase transgene plasmids comprise 4 copies of the Gal4 consensus binding sequence, a thymidine kinase (tk) minimal promoter, the amino acid coding sequence of either Gclc or Gclm cDNA, and a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence. The p17 × 4-tk Gclc or Gclm plasmids were digested with AatII and KpnI to yield 2.8- and 1.7-kb fragments, respectively. These plasmid fragments were purified by gel electroelution plus phenol extraction and resuspended in Tris EDTA, pH 7.5, buffer. Glutamate-cysteine Ligase Transgenic Mice—All animal procedures were carried out following protocols approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in microisolator caging. C57Bl/6 (75%) X C3H (25%) pronuclear embryos were collected on E0.5, following superovulation. E0.5 was taken as the morning of the day that copulation plugs were observed. Pregnant mare serum gonadotropin for superovulation was purchased from the National Hormone and Peptide Program (Torrance, CA). Constructs were injected into the pronucleus, and embryos were transferred into the oviducts of E0.5 pseudopregnant dams either on the day of injection or following overnight culture to the 2-cell stage and allowed to progress to term. Genotyping of Gclc and Gclm Transgenic Mice—At 3-4 weeks of age tail biopsies were taken from pups and glutamate-cysteine ligase transgene status was determined by PCR using reverse primers designed to hybridize internally to either the Gclc (GAAGTAGCCTCCTTCCGGCG) or Gclm (CTGTGCAACTCCAAGGACGGA) cDNA sequences, and a forward primer (GAACACCGAGCGACCCTGCA) designed to hybridize to the thymidine kinase promoter region in the integrated plasmid fragment (Fig. 1). Genotyping of GLVP Transgenic Mice—The same tail biopsies that were used to determine glutamate-cysteine ligase transgene status were used to identify the GLVP transgene status by PCR using GLVP forward (GACGCGCTAGACGATTTC) and reverse (AGCAAAGAACTGGAGGTG) primers (14Wang Y. DeMayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Breeding of Gclm/Gclc Bigenic, Gclm/GLVP Bigenic, Gclc/GLVP Bigenic, and Gclc/Gclm/GLVP Trigenic Mice—Progeny of the glutamate-cysteine ligase transgene positive founder lines were bred to GLVP transgenic mice, and the resulting progeny were backcrossed at least 6 generations with C57Bl/6 mice. All APAP experiments were conducted with mice that had been bred onto the C57Bl/6 genetic background. Mifepristone Administration—In initial experiments, a single intraperitoneal injection of mifepristone (5 mg/kg in sesame oil; Sigma) was administered to mice 8-9 h prior to sacrifice, to determine which founder strains were carrying responsive glutamate-cysteine ligase transgenes. In later experiments, animals from responsive strains were injected intraperitoneally 3 times with mifepristone (5 mg/kg each time at 24, 16, and 8 h prior to sacrifice). Control animals were administered vehicle only (sesame oil) at the same times. Tissue Collection—Mice were sacrificed by CO2 narcosis/cervical dislocation. Livers were removed for biochemical, histological, and gene expression analyses. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from liver tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and subjected to Northern blot analysis using standard methods (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized with either Gclc or Gclm 32P-labeled murine cDNA, corresponding to the amino acid coding regions (16Reid L.L. Botta D. Lu Y. Gallagher E.P. Kavanagh T.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Reid L.L. Botta D. Shao J. Hudson F.N. Kavanagh T.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or β-actin cDNA probes, and relative mRNA levels were determined by phosphorimager analysis (GelDoc, Bio-Rad). Glutamate-cysteine ligase transcripts originating from the transgenes were distinguished from the endogenous glutamate-cysteine ligase transcripts based on their differential migration in agarose gels (different 3′ non-coding region lengths). Quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR)—Total liver RNA was extracted in TRIzol reagent and used to generate cDNA by reverse transcription using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNA was then used to quantitate the mRNA levels of Gclc and Gclm endogenous and transgenes using an ABI 7700 Sequence Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The technique involved the use of sequence-specific fluorogenic probes that border exon/exon boundaries in the processed mRNAs. PCR primers and probes were selected using Primer Express 1.5™ software (Applied Biosystems). A reference standard of normal mouse kidney RNA was serially diluted to derive a linear regression formula over 4 orders of magnitude that was then used to calculate and quantitate expression. Glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA expression was used to normalize glutamate-cysteine ligase mRNA expression. Endogenous transcripts were differentiated from transgenic sequences using primers specific for Gclc and Gclm and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region of the target gene (Table 1 and Fig. 1).TABLE 1Description of oligonucleotide primers and probes used in quantitative real time PCR analysisMouse primers and probe sequencesTm°CGclc forward, 5′-ATgTggACACCCgATgCAgTATT-3′61.3Gclc reverse, 5′-TgTCTTgCTTgTAgTCAggATggTTT-3′61.1Gclc probe, 5′-6FAMTTCTCCAgATgCTCTCTTCT-MGB-3′72.2Gclm forward, 5′-gCCACCAgATTTgACTgCCTTT-3′61.3Gclm reverse, 5′-CAgggATgCTTTCTTgAAgAgCTT-3′61.1Gclm probe, 5′-6FAM-CACAATgACCCgAAAgAA-MGB-3′73.4Transgenic reverse, 5′-gTgCTggATATCTgCAgAATTCg-3′59.7GAPDHaGAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward, 5′-TCCTgCACCACCAACTgCTT-3′60.3GAPDH reverse, 5′-gAggggCCATCCACAgTCTT-3′59.9GAPDH probe, 5′-6FAM-CACTCATgACCACAgTCCATgC CATCAC-TAMRA-3′70.0a GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Open table in a new tab GCL Protein Expression—Proteins were extracted from mouse livers by sonication in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm l-serine, 20 mm boric acid supplemented with protease inhibitors as previously described (20Franklin C.C.

Fifty μg of soluble protein were subjected to Western analysis using anti-glutamate-cysteine ligase antisera generated in rabbits (22Thompson S.A. White C.C. Krejsa C.M. Diaz D. Woods J.S. Eaton D.L.

Exposed x-ray films were then subjected to image analysis (GelDoc) to determine the levels of Gclc and Gclm proteins. Glutathione and Glutamate-cysteine Ligase Activity—Baseline and inducible glutamate-cysteine ligase activity and GSH levels in liver homogenates were assayed by HPLC or by fluorescence biochemical assay essentially as previously described (23White C.C.

APAP Administration—Prior to the administration of APAP (Sigma) or vehicle (normal saline), some mice were dosed 3 times with mifepristone dissolved in sesame oil as stated above and other mice received sesame oil alone. All animals in the study were fasted for 12 h prior to APAP injections. Mice from both the trigenic (Gclc/Gclm/GLVP) and control (Gclc/Gclm only) groups received APAP (300 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) 8 h after the last mifepristone (or sesame oil) injection. A second set of mice with similar genotypes received vehicle (saline) instead of APAP. Immediately after APAP (or saline) injections, food was returned to all cages. Six hours later, the mice were sacrificed by CO2 narcosis/cervical dislocation, and livers were harvested. Alanine Aminotransferase Assay—Immediately after sacrifice, a blood sample was taken via cardiac puncture. Serum alanine aminotransferase activity was evaluated spectrophotometrically using a commercially available kit (Sigma). Histopathology—Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained liver sections were prepared using routine methods (Anatomical Pathology Services, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA). Scoring of tissue injury (on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 = no injury; 5 = severe hepatocellular necrosis) was conducted by three independent observers blinded with respect to transgene status and treatment. Further evaluation of the liver sections was made by Dr. Robert Pierce, University of Rochester, a board certified pathologist. Acetaminophen Protein and Glutathione Adducts—We modified the method of Muldrew et al. (26Muldrew K.L. James L.P. Coop L. McCullough S.S. Hendrickson H.P. Hinson J.A. Mayeux P.R. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2002; 30: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) to measure the levels of APAP protein and APAP glutathione adducts using HPLC with electrochemical detection. For glutathione APAP adducts, liver tissue was homogenized (1:5, w/v) in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5, and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. One hundred μl of supernatant was combined with 100 μl of 20% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid for 15 min, and then centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g. Fifty μl of supernatant was then added to 950 μl of 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5, and aliquots were then assayed using reverse-phase HPLC with electrochemical detection. For protein APAP adducts, livers were homogenized as above in 10 mm sodium acetate and centrifuged at 16,000 × g. Five hundred μl of supernatant was then mixed 1:1 with 10 mm sodium acetate and subjected to dialysis (Slide-A-Lyser, Pierce; 3,500 MWCO) against 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5, for 19-22 h at 4 °C. Samples were then diluted 1:3 in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer. Ten μl of protease solution (200 mg/ml, Sigma) was then added to 1 ml of dialyzed sample and incubated at 50 °C for 20-24 h. One-hundred fifty μl of digested sample was then mixed with 150 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid, placed on ice for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Fifty μl of supernatant was then added to 450 μl of 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, and samples were analyzed by HPLC with electrochemical detection as above. APAP-glutathione adduct standards and APAP-cysteine adduct standards were generated by incubating 250 μm GSH or 250 μm cysteine with 250 μm APAP for 4 h in the presence of NADPH (2 mm) and microsomes (400 μg of protein/ml) containing recombinant human cytochrome P450 2E1 (BD Biosciences). Statistical Analyses—The results for GSH levels, glutamate-cysteine ligase activity, glutathione and protein APAP adducts, alanine aminotransferase activity, and histopathology scores were analyzed by analysis of variance and Student's t test. Regression analyses and F tests were also performed on selected comparisons of these data. Differences yielding a p value of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Generation of Glutamate-cysteine Ligase Transgenic Mice— Using standard techniques, we generated mice possessing Gclc or Gclm cDNA transgenes flanked by the 17 × 4 Gal4 recognition elements and the minimal tk promoter (Fig. 1). Four Gclc and 7 Gclm transgenic founder lines were identified by PCR using reverse primers specific for the glutamate-cysteine ligase subunit cDNA portion of each plasmid construct, as well as a forward primer homologous to the tk promoter (present in both glutamate-cysteine ligase subunit plasmid constructs; Fig. 1). These transgenes were inherited in a simple Mendelian manner, and there were neither gender bias of heredity in the progeny, nor fertility problems associated with the presence of any of the transgenes (data not shown). Gclc and Gclm transgenic mice were crossed with mice carrying the liver-specific and mifepristone responsive transactivator GLVP. Subsequently, these two lines were intercrossed (Gclc/GLVP X Gclm/GLVP) to generate trigenic mice (Gclc/Gclm/GLVP). All mice were backcrossed onto a C57Bl/6 genetic background for at least 6 generations prior to the initiation of the APAP exposures. Characterization of Glutamate-cysteine Ligase Overexpressing Transgenic Mice—The 4 Gclc/GLVP and the 7 Gclm/GLVP founder lines were analyzed for inducible RNA transgene expression by administration of mifepristone. Initially, both Northern blot and qRT-PCR analyses were applied to detect both the endogenous and the transgenic Gclc and Gclm transcripts. After several concurring experiments qRT-PCR became the preferred method of detection and quantification of these transcripts (Fig. 2). Utilizing a primer sequence from the bovine growth hormone poly(A) 3′ end of the target gene construct (Fig. 1), we were able to distinguish the transgenic transcripts from the endogenous glutamate-cysteine ligase transcripts. Several of our founder lines showed no detectable transgene mRNA expression. Protein expression and glutamate-cysteine ligase activity were next evaluated in Gclc/GLVP bigenic, Gclm/GLVP bigenic, and Gclc/Gclm/GLVP trigenic mice that showed inducible transgene mRNA expression. There was an increase in Gclm and Gclc protein expression that was predicted by the presence of Gclc and Gclm transgene mRNA expression (Fig. 3). Interestingly, Gclm/GLVP bigenic mice treated with mifepristone exhibited an increase not only in Gclm protein but also appeared to have increased levels of Gclc protein 9 h after mifepristone treatment (even though Gclc transgene mRNA was not increased in these mice; Fig. 2). This may be due to a transient stabilizing effect of Gclm on Gclc protein in this strain of transgenic mice. Importantly, there was an increase in glutamate-cysteine ligase activity associated with mifepristone-induced increases in glutamate-cysteine ligase protein expression (Fig. 3D). The results of early experiments with this transgenic model indicated that maximal glutamate-cysteine ligase protein expression in the transgenic mice was between 8 and 9 h after a single mifepristone injection. To achieve more consistency in glutamate-cysteine ligase induction and expression, we administered 3 consecutive 5 mg/kg doses of mifepristone given 8 h apart. With repeated mifepristone dosing there was again a notable increase in Gclm protein expression in Gclc/Gclm/GLVP trigenic mice (but not in Gclc/Gclm bigenic mice) 8 h after the last mifepristone injection (Fig. 4). However, under these conditions Gclc protein expression was not elevated. We also noted that glutamate-cysteine ligase activity was elevated in female Gclc/Gclm/GLVP trigenic mice (but not males) with repeated doses of mifepristone (Fig. 5A). No significant increases in glutathione were noted. We found a similar effect in glutamate-cysteine ligase-transfected Hepa-1 cells (24Botta D. Franklin C.C. White C.C. Krejsa C.M. Dabrowski M.J. Pierce R.H. Fausto N. Kavanagh T.J. Free Radic. Biol.

We anticipated that mice overexpressing glutamate-cysteine ligase would either be resistant to APAP-induced GSH depletion or may replete GSH stores at a faster rate subsequent to APAP treatment. In a preliminary experiment we found that the kinetics of GSH depletion and repletion in mifepristone pretreated Gclc/Gclm bigenic (control) mice and Gclc/Gclm/GLVP trigenic mice after administration of APAP was similar in these two strains, although the trigenic mice were slightly more able to restore their GSH by 6 h (84%) relative to that seen in Gclc/Gclm mice (72%) (data not shown). Furthermore, although the number of mice was small (two male and two female mice of each"
https://openalex.org/W2036634833,"We studied the mechanisms of antigen presentation of CD4 T cell epitopes of the capsular Caf1 antigen of Yersinia pestis using murine bone marrow macrophages as antigen presenting cells and T cell hybridomas specific for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted epitopes distributed throughout the Caf1 sequence. The data revealed diversity in the pathways used and the degrees of antigen processing required depending on the structural context of epitopes within the Caf1 molecule. Two epitopes in the carboxyl-terminal globular domain were presented by newly synthesized MHC class II after low pH-dependent lysosomal processing, whereas an epitope located in a flexible amino-terminal strand was presented by mature MHC class II independent of low pH and with no detectable requirement for proteolytic processing. A fourth epitope located between the two regions of Caf1 showed intermediate behavior. The data are consistent with progressive unfolding and cleavage of rCaf1 from the amino terminus as it traverses the endosomal pathway, the availability of epitopes determining which pool of MHC class II is preferentially loaded. The Caf1 capsular protein is a component of second generation plague vaccines and an understanding of the mechanisms and pathways of MHC class II-restricted presentation of multiple epitopes from this candidate vaccine antigen should inform the choice of delivery systems and adjuvants that target vaccines successfully to appropriate intracellular locations to induce protective immune responses against as wide a T cell repertoire as possible."

On this basis, the purpose of the current study was to identify the specific amino acid residues in the TPR protein that regulate ligand coordination and binding. The sites selected for mutation reside within or in close proximity to a region we previously defined as a TPR ligand binding region (i.e. the C terminus of the second extracellular loop and the leading edge of the fifth transmembrane domain). Mutation of these residues caused varying effects on the TPR-ligand coordination process. Specifically, the D193A, D193Q, and D193R mutants lost SQ29,548 (antagonist) binding and exhibited a dramatically reduced calcium response, which could not be restored by elevated U46619 (agonist) doses. The F184Y mutant lost SQ29,548 binding and exhibited a reduced calcium response (which could be restored by elevated U46619); and the T186A and S191T mutants lost SQ29,548 binding and retained a normal U46619-induced calcium response. Furthermore, these last three mutants also revealed a divergence in the binding of two structurally different antagonists, SQ29,548 and BM13.505. Two separate mutants that exhibited SQ29,548 binding yielded either a normal (F196Y) or reduced (S201T) U46619 response.

In this regard, ample evidence exists for the direct participation of TPR activation in the prevention of blood loss upon vascular damage as well as its participation in occlusive vascular disease (11Ushikubi F.

Med. 1994; 330: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 17Clarke R.J. Mayo G. Price P. FitzGerald G.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 1137-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) is the ability of aspirin to block TXA2 synthesis. On the other hand, aspirin therapy is also associated with certain undesirable effects unrelated to inhibition of TXA2 production, particularly inhibition of prostacyclin synthesis. Consequently, as an alternative pharmacological approach, research efforts have been directed at designing specific TPR antagonists to inhibit TPR ligand binding. However, one difficulty facing the development of such antagonists is that to date there has not been a comprehensive analysis of the actual TPR binding domains at the amino acid level. Nevertheless, previous studies have attempted to identify certain amino acid residues that may participate in ligand coordination to this receptor. Initially, these studies focused on the transmembrane regions of the TPR protein, since earlier findings with the G-protein-coupled receptor bovine rhodopsin revealed a putative binding domain in its seventh transmembrane region (TM7) (18Findlay J.B. Pappin D.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 625-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The results from these studies implicated all of the transmembrane regions in mediating TPR-ligand binding, with the exception of TM2 (19Narumiya S. Hirata N. Namba T. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F.

Similarly, molecular modeling studies also proposed that residues interacting with TPR ligands are found mainly in the transmembrane regions (24Yamamoto Y. Kamiya K. Terao S. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). On the other hand, separate studies have suggested the possible involvement of different TPR regions in ligand coordination. In this connection, our previous experiments employing a biotinylated TPR antagonist (25Komiotis D. Wencel-Drake J.D. Dieter J.P. Lim C.T. Le Breton G.C. Biochem.

Furthermore, later studies using photoaffinity labeling and site-specific antibodies demonstrated that TPR ligand binding sites reside within an 11-amino acid sequence contained in the C-terminal segment of the second extracellular loop (C-EL2) (26Turek J.W.

Although these previous studies identified EL2 as being critical for ligand binding, they did not identify the specific amino acids that participate in this process. Based on this consideration, the present work elucidated the effects of point mutations in C-EL2 of the thromboxane A2 receptor and its close proximal region, TM5, on ligand coordination and function. Depending on the location and the nature of the amino acid substitution at the target sites in C-EL2 or TM5, three major phenotypes were observed: 1) a mutant receptor that lost SQ29,548 binding and exhibited a substantially reduced calcium response (which could not be restored with elevated U46619 doses); 2) a mutant that lost SQ29,548 binding and exhibited a reduced calcium response (which could be restored with elevated levels of the U46619); and 3) a mutant that could differentiate not only between SQ29,548 (antagonist) binding and functional responses (U46619) but also between two distinct classes of TPR antagonists (i.e. SQ29,548 and BM13.505). On the other hand, a “control” mutation that lacked any detectable effects on TPR structure or function was also observed, indicating that changes in only certain amino acids within C-EL2 influence the biological phenotype of this receptor protein. The results also provide evidence that these amino acids play a differential role in regulating the ligand-receptor interaction process and suggest possible mechanisms by which this process occurs.

Polyclonal rabbit anti-TPR IgG was previously made and characterized in our laboratory. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and normal rabbit IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Cell culture supplies were purchased from Fisher. Molecular modeling studies (27Jin B. Hopfinger A.J. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1994; 34: 1014-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 28Taylor D.M. Halushka P.V. Meier G.P. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 38: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) have indicated that crucial ligand coordination sites are likely to mediate binding to the receptor through hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions, or hydrophobic bonds. Thus, mutations were conducted (in C-EL2 or TM5) at amino acid sites that are charged, are hydrophobic, or contain hydrogen donors (i.e. Phe184, Thr186, Glu190, Ser191, and Asp193 in C-EL2 and Phe196, Phe200, and Ser201 in TM5). Examples of the engineered mutations are F184Y, T186A, E190A, S191T, D193A, and S201T. It was reasoned that analysis of these mutations would serve two purposes: first to identify critical amino acids involved in TPR ligand coordination and second to provide insight into the nature of the molecular forces involved in these coordination processes. The human wild-type TPR cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector. The mutants were generated according to the standard protocol of QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and confirmed by automated sequencing. Transfections into HEK cells were performed according to the protocol for Effectene transfection (Qiagen) to generate stable cell lines. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 48 h, G418 was added for selection of stable cell line clones. HEK cells represented an excellent model for the transfection studies, since they possessed very low basal expression of TPR as revealed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), radioligand binding and Ca2+ studies (not shown). Cells were harvested with trypsin, and their number was adjusted to 2–5 × 106 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fifty μl of cell suspension was placed in a flow cytometry tube and incubated with either a rabbit polyclonal anti-TPR antibody (1:50, v/v) or normal rabbit IgG (control) (1:100, v/v) for 1 h at room temperature. Next, 0.5 ml of PBS was added, and cells were washed by centrifugation for 5 min at 1200 rpm. The supernatant was aspirated, and this procedure was repeated at least twice. Fifty μl of the secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was added (1:50, v/v) and incubated with the cells in darkness for 1 h at room temperature. PBS (0.5 ml) was then added, and single-color analysis was performed on the samples using a BD Biosciences FACStar analyzer. A lower limit threshold was set for data acquisition, thereby eliminating background scatter. Saturation Binding—The cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated 12-well plates. Upon confluence, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated with various predefined concentrations of [3H]SQ29,548 for 40 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. Next, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and 500 μl of 0.3 n NaOH was added. The plates were shaken for 10 min at room temperature to detach the cells, and 100 μl of 3.0 n HCl was added to neutralize the pH. The solubilized cell solution was then transferred to vials containing 8 ml of scintillation fluid. To calculate the nonspecific binding, the same concentration of radioligand was competed against 1000-fold excess of unlabeled SQ29,548. In each case, the cells were plated in duplicates, and the experiment was repeated at least three times. Samples were counted in a Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter. Saturation binding isotherm curves were generated by applying nonlinear regression, GraphPad PRISM software (San Diego, CA), to determine the affinity (Kd). It is noteworthy that saturation isotherms are not presented for certain mutants. This is because these mutants displayed no concentration-dependent specific binding for [3H]SQ29,548, which thus prevented a Kd calculation. Displacement Binding—These experiments were performed using a protocol similar to the saturation binding protocol with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with 1 nm [3H]SQ29,548 at room temperature for 20 min with gentle shaking. Increasing concentrations of U46619 (the displacing ligand) (2 nm to 30 μm) were then added, and the cells were shaken gently for an additional 20 min. Next, the cells were solubilized, the cell solution was transferred to vials containing 8 ml of scintillation fluid, and the samples were counted for [3H]SQ29,548 activity. Displacement binding curves were generated by applying nonlinear regression analysis and GraphPad PRISM software to determine the U46619 Ki. HEK cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated 25-mm diameter glass coverslips and washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, prior to loading with 3 μm Fura2/AM for 25 min at 37 °C. After two additional washes with Hanks' balanced salt solution, intracellular calcium was quantified by Fura2 fluorescence imaging (29Tiruppathi C. Yan W. Sandoval R. Naqvi T. Pronin A.N.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7953-7961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using an Attofluor ratio vision digital fluorescence microscopy system (Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD) attached to an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert S100) and a F-Fluar 40 oil immersion objective. This system excites cells at 334 and 380 nm and measures emission at 520 nm. Briefly, a field of cells was visualized, and 50–60 cells were randomly selected. The change in the 334/380 excitation ratio was measured every 5 s. The average absolute peak change in ratio 334/380 of the selected cells within this field was measured. The effective concentration 50 (EC50) values were determined by applying nonlinear regression analysis to the dose-response curves generated for each mutant. However, no EC50 is presented in the case of mutants where the maximum wild-type functional response could not be restored by excessive agonist concentrations. Next, the average and S.E. of at least three separate experiments was calculated. This procedure was repeated for the wild type and each of the mutants. Statistical analysis was then performed to determine which mutants exhibited a response that was statistically different from that of the wild-type. For the inhibitor studies, Fura2-loaded cells were preincubated with either 0.05–1 μm SQ29,548 or 0.05–5 μm BM13.505 at room temperature for ∼10 min prior to stimulation with agonist. All experiments were performed at least three times. Data were analyzed using GraphPad PRISM statistical software (San Diego, CA) and presented as mean ± S.E. Saturation binding isotherms and displacement binding curves were generated using nonlinear regression analysis. Results from the wild type and the different mutants were compared using unpaired two-tailed Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Reconstitution of a Stable Human Wild-type TPR-expressing HEK Cell Line—Initially, HEK cells with stable expression of the wild-type human TPR were generated in order to serve as a control and allow comparison with the cells expressing point mutations in the TPR sequence. This stable cell line was characterized using three separate procedures: 1) fluorescence-activated cell sorting to determine and quantify cell surface receptor expression; 2) antagonist radioligand binding to evaluate the receptor binding affinity (calculate Kd); and 3) calcium mobilization experiments to assess agonist-induced functional activity and generate EC50 values. FACS analysis revealed that these cells expressed TPR on their plasma membrane, as indicated by the rightward shift in the mean fluorescence intensity of the wild-type TPR cells compared with the control nontransfected cells (Fig. 1A and Table 1). The saturation binding isotherm generated using the radiolabeled TPR antagonist ([3H]SQ29,548) yielded a dissociation constant (Kd) of 7 ± 1 nm (Fig. 1B and Table 4), which is similar to the Kd value previously reported for this ligand in human platelets (2Kim S.O.

Open table in a new tab Calcium mobilization studies were performed using the TPR agonist U46619. The results demonstrated that U46619 stimulated substantial Ca2+ mobilization in the transfected cells within a few seconds of its addition (Fig. 1C and Table 2). Dose-response analysis using 0.25–5 μm U46619 indicated an EC50 of 430 ± 20 nm, with a maximal calcium mobilization at 1 μm (Table 3 and Fig. 1C, inset). Dose-response inhibition analysis was then performed for two TPR antagonists, SQ29,548 and BM13.505. It was found that complete inhibition of 1 μm U46619-induced Ca2+ mobilization required 1 μm SQ29,548 (Fig. 1D) and 5 μm BM13.505 (Fig. 1E). Moreover, the Ca2+ response to carbachol was not blocked by either of these antagonists (Fig. 1, D and E), indicating that the U46619-induced Ca2+ mobilization was specifically TPR-mediated. Collectively, these data demonstrate the successful reconstitution of wild-type human TPRs in HEK cells. These TPRs were stably expressed on the surface, possessed a binding Kd comparable with human platelets, and exhibited TPR-mediated functional activity.TABLE 2The average absolute peak change in ratio 334/380 nm of the different stable cell linesCell lineRatio 334/380WT0.55 ± 0.05F184Aap < 0.05.0.12 ± 0.02F184A (5 μm)0.52 ± 0.02F184Yap < 0.05.0.13 ± 0.02F184Y (5 μm)0.41 ± 0.01T186A0.46 ± 0.02T186S0.52 ± 0.04E190A0.57 ± 0.04E190D0.45 ± 0.03S191A0.43 ± 0.02S191T0.57 ± 0.05F196A0.48 ± 0.05F196Y0.43 ± 0.05F200A0.47 ± 0.08F200Y0.53 ± 0.07S201Aap < 0.05.0.12 ± 0.01S201A (5 μm)0.45 ± 0.03S201Tap < 0.05.0.12 ± 0.01S201T (5 μm)0.45 ± 0.05D193E0.51 ± 0.05D193N0.41 ± 0.03D193Aap < 0.05.0.00D193Aap < 0.05.

Open table in a new tab The effects of specific mutations (within C-EL2 or TM5 of TPR) on ligand-receptor binding and function were next evaluated, again using the three procedures described above. Nineteen mutants were engineered and stably expressed; D193A, D193E, D193N, D193Q, D193R, S191A, S191T, E190A, E190D, T186A, T186S, F184A, and F184Y were within C-EL2, whereas S201T, S201A, F200Y, F200A, F196Y, and F196A were within TM5 (Fig. 2). Only the clones that possessed TPR surface expression levels comparable with the wild type (Table 1) were utilized for further experimentation. This is an important consideration based on our previous findings that TPR ligand affinity can be affected by its surface expression levels (32Huang J.S. Dong L. Le Breton G.C. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 564-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Aspartic Acid 193 Mutations: D193A, D193E, D193N, D193Q, and D193R—The first amino acid residue selected for mutagenesis was aspartic acid (Asp193), which is a charged residue that can interact with ligands through ionic or hydrogen bonding. This residue was first mutated to alanine, which does not possess the side chain of the original amino acid and therefore can no longer engage in such interactions. FACS analysis of this cell line revealed a rightward shift in the mean fluorescence intensity as compared with the control nontransfected HEK cells (data not shown, and see Table 1), indicating surface expression of TPRs. The effects of this mutation were first evaluated by radioligand binding experiments. It was found that the D193A mutation rendered the receptor incapable of binding to [3H]SQ29,548 (Fig. 3A), even at a radioligand concentration that normally saturates wild-type TPR binding (50 nm). The functional consequence of this mutation was a loss of Ca2+ mobilization in response to 1 μm U46619 (Fig. 3B and Table 2). Moreover, raising the dose of U46619 by as much as 10-fold (i.e. to 10 μm) still only resulted in a 40% restoration of the wild-type response (Table 2). Thus, the Ca2+ response in this mutant remained attenuated even at suprapharmacological concentrations of U46619, and because of this, a meaningful EC50 value could not be obtained. On the other hand, the D193A mutant retained its ability to mobilize Ca2+ in response to a muscarinic receptor agonist (i.e. carbachol) (Fig. 3B), indicating that the reduced response to U46619 was not due to a general loss of calcium-mobilizing capability. Taken together, these data indicate that the D193A phenotype is represented by a loss of SQ29,548 binding and an inhibited functional response to U46619. Consequently, Asp193 appears to play a critical role in the TPR-ligand binding process, and hydrogen and/or ionic bonding at 193 is essential for this interaction. To further characterize the importance of hydrogen or ionic bonding at this position, a separate mutant D193E (which could theoretically restore these interactions) was generated. Analysis revealed that this mutant was expressed on the surface at levels comparable with the wild type (Table 1) and that it bound [3H]SQ29,548 with a Kd comparable with the wild type (Kd = 5 ± 0.2 nm) (Fig. 3C and Table 4). Furthermore, 1 μm U46619 also mobilized Ca2+ to the same extent as that observed in the wild-type TPR (Fig. 3D and Table 2), with an EC50 (430 ± 10 nm) (Table 3) identical to that of the wild type. Finally, this functional response was blocked with SQ29,548 (1 μm; not shown) and BM13.505 (5 μm; not shown). Therefore, these results demonstrate that replacement of Asp193 with glutamic acid does not lead to a loss of TPR ligand binding and function, suggesting that the hydrogen/ionic bonding requirements at residue 193 are not limited to a single amino acid (i.e. aspartic acid). To further define the interaction requirements at 193, the D193N mutant was studied. This mutant can engage in hydrogen bonding but not ionic interactions. It was found that the D193N mutant possessed surface protein levels similar to the wild type (Table 1) and exhibited a higher affinity for [3H]SQ29,548 (Kd of 2 ± 0.3 nm) (Fig. 3E and Table 4). Interestingly, although this mutant possessed a lower Kd for SQ29,548, it exhibited a 1 μm U46619-mediated calcium response (Fig. 3F and Table 2) and EC50 (435 ± 35 nm) (Table 3) that were not different from the wild type. Therefore, this mutation appears to selectively increase SQ29,548 binding. Furthermore, the observed calcium mobilization was completely inhibited with either 1 μm SQ29,548 or 5 μm BM13.505 (not shown). Thus, it appears that hydrogen bonding at position 193 is sufficient to support ligand binding/functional activity and that a negatively charged side chain is not critical for such activity. On this basis, it might be predicted that a different amino acid capable of hydrogen bonding may also support TPR ligand binding and function. This was next explored by using the D193Q mutant. However, it was found that D193Q, which had expression levels comparable with the wild type (Table 1), neither bound [3H]SQ29,548 (Fig. 3G and Table 4) nor mobilized calcium in response to 1 μm U46619 (Fig. 3H, Table 2). Consequently, it appears that optimal ligand interaction at this position not only requires hydrogen bonding but also involves additional conformational and chemical characteristics of the amino acid side chain. Finally, the effects of reversing the charge and modifying the side chain characteristics at position 193 were investigated. In this case, the negative charge of aspartic acid was replaced with positively charged arginine (D193R). Whereas this substituted amino acid can also engage in hydrogen"
https://openalex.org/W2062360478,"STAT5 is a transcription factor essential for hematopoietic physiology. STAT5 functions to transduce signals from cytokines to the nucleus where it regulates gene expression. Although several important transcriptional targets of STAT5 are known, most remain unidentified. To identify novel STAT5 targets, we searched chromosomes 21 and 22 for clusters of STAT5 binding sites contained within regions of interspecies homology. We identified four such regions, including one with tandem STAT5 binding sites in the first intron of the NCAM2 gene. Unlike known STAT5 binding sites, this site is found within a very large intron and resides ∼200 kb from the first coding exon of NCAM2. We demonstrate that this region confers STAT5-dependent transcriptional activity. We show that STAT5 binds in vivo to the NCAM2 intron in the NKL natural killer cell line and that this binding is induced by cytokines that activate STAT5. Neither STAT1 nor STAT3 bind to this region, despite sharing a consensus binding sequence with STAT5. Activation of STAT4 and STAT5 causes the accumulation of both of these STATs to the NCAM2 regulatory region. Therefore, using an informatics based approach to identify STAT5 targets, we have identified NCAM2 as both a STAT4- and STAT5-regulated gene, and we show that its expression is regulated by cytokines essential for natural killer cell survival and differentiation. This strategy may be an effective way to identify functional binding regions for transcription factors with known cognate binding sites anywhere in the genome.

STATs are activated by phosphorylation induced by cytokines and growth factors and regulate gene transcription by binding to DNA regulatory regions. STATs have been implicated in numerous solid as well as hematopoietic cancers (1Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar, 2Frank D.A. Cancer Treat. Res. 2003; 115: 267-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sternberg D.W. Gilliland D.G. J. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 22: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One well studied example is chronic myelogenous leukemia, in which the Bcr/Abl oncogene causes the constitutive activation of STAT5, which directly leads to continuous up-regulation of antiapoptotic genes, such as bcl-x (4Horita M.

STAT5 refers to two different genes, STAT5a and STAT5b, which encode highly related proteins (5Grimley P.M. Dong F. Rui H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 131-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). STAT5a and STAT5b null mice show both overlapping and distinct phenotypes, suggesting that their transcriptional targets may not be identical (6Liu X. Robinson G.W. Wagner K.-U. Garrett L. Wynshaw-Boris A. Hennighausen L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 7Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.-H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W.

Finbloom D.S. Blood. 1997; 90: 1768-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have shown previously that both STAT5a and STAT5b can bind to the same regulatory region when both are activated, although there are differences in the temporal binding patterns of STAT5a and STAT5b (9Nelson E.A. Walker S.R. Alvarez J.V. Frank D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54724-54730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, both STAT5 proteins seem to bind to the same targets, and any differences between STAT5a and STAT5b may arise from differential expression or differences in kinetics of DNA binding. An essential component to understanding STAT5 function is to have a more complete picture of STAT5 transcriptional targets as well as to have a greater understanding of the STAT5 binding sites within these targets. Regulatory regions have traditionally been thought to be associated with the 5′-end of genes, and thus, searches for transcription factor binding sites have often been confined to this region. Identifying functional regulatory elements in the 5′ region has yielded valuable insight into transcriptional regulation. However, functional transcription factor binding sites can be found far from the 5′-end of the gene. For example, the STAT5 binding site for the insulin-like growth factor-1 gene is located ∼75 kb from the 5′-end (10Wang Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10955-10963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, most functional STAT5 binding sites appear to be located within introns, with a bias toward the first intron (9Nelson E.A. Walker S.R. Alvarez J.V. Frank D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54724-54730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, our emerging knowledge of transcription factor binding sites necessitates looking beyond the immediate 5′ region of particular genes. Evolutionary pressures require the conservation of important non-protein-coding regulatory regions, and thus, transcription factor binding sites are often conserved across species (11Ureta-Vidal A. Ettwiller L. Birney E. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To identify functional STAT5 binding sites, we made use of the fact that transcription factor binding sites can be identified in regions of sequence conservation (12Bulyk M.L. Genome Biol. 2003; 5: 201Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We focused on chromosomes 21 and 22, which are two small, well characterized chromosomes. Given that STAT5 can bind to cognate DNA sequences in tandem (13Meyer W.K. Reichenbach P. Schindler U. Soldaini E. Nabholz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31821-31828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14John S. Vinkemeier U. Soldaini E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Leonard W.J. Mol.

Chretien S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5852-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we searched for regions of high homology that also contained two STAT5 consensus binding sites. Using this strategy, we identified such a sequence in the first intron of NCAM2 (neural cell adhesion molecule 2). We demonstrate that the identified consensus sites are functional, and we show that NCAM2 is expressed when STAT5 is activated. Last, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we show that STAT5 binds to this site in vivo, conclusively demonstrating that this region is a functional STAT5 binding site. Despite sharing a consensus binding sequence, neither STAT1 nor STAT3 is able to bind to this site in NKL cells. However, we show that STAT4 can bind to the NCAM2 intronic element. Thus, combining bioinformatic techniques with knowledge of STAT5 binding sites can be used to identify novel STAT5 targets and to better understand STAT-mediated transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, this technique should be applicable to any transcription factor for which binding sequences have been defined. Cell Lines—The human natural killer cell line NKL (16Robertson M.J. Cochran K.J. Cameron C. Le J.M. Tantravahi R. Ritz J. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 406-415PubMed Google Scholar) was maintained in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 25 units/ml recombinant human IL-2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Human breast cancer T47D cells and human 293 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Antibodies and Cytokines—Antibodies recognizing STAT5a (sc-1081), total STAT5 (sc-835), STAT4 (sc-486), STAT1 (sc-346), STAT3 (sc-482), p300 (sc-585), and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (sc-9001) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-STAT5b (catalog number 13-5300) and anti-phospho-STAT1 (catalog number 33-3400) were obtained from Invitrogen. Anti-phospho-STAT5 (catalog number 935-1L), and anti-phospho-STAT3 (catalog number 9131) were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Normal rabbit IgG was obtained from Caltag (Burlingame, CA). Recombinant human IL-2, IL-6, IFN-α, IFN-γ, and prolactin were obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant human IL-10 was obtained from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Cell Stimulations—NKL cells were starved of IL-2 for 1 day and then stimulated with 50 units/ml IL-2, 10 ng/ml IL-6, 100 ng/ml IL-10, 50,000 units/ml IFN-α, or 500 units/ml IFN-γ. Cells were stimulated for 15 min for Western blots and immunoprecipitations, 30 min for ChIP, and from 1 to 24 h for RT-PCR. Candidate STAT5 Binding Site Prediction—We searched the STAT5 consensus binding sequence, TTCN3GAA, along the repeat-masked and coding region-masked human chromosomes 21 and 22 to find all of the possible STAT5 consensus binding sites. The repeat-masked chromosomes and associated annotation were downloaded from the University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser (available on the World Wide Web at genome.ucsc.edu). The RefSeq table was used to mask the coding regions. We further narrowed down the list of potential STAT5 binding sites by incorporating sequence conservation between humans and either mice or rats. The human/mouse/rat whole genome alignment (17Brudno M. Poliakov A. Salamov A. Cooper G.M. Sidow A. Rubin E.M. Solovyev V. Batzoglou S. Dubchak I. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was extracted from the Berkeley Genome Pipeline (available on the World Wide Web at pipeline.lbl.gov/). The conservation score of each STAT5 binding site was defined as the average sequence identity ((number of matched nucleotides - number of Indels)/25, where an “Indel” represents an insertion or a deletion) of a 25-mer window centered at the corresponding binding site. Consensus sites were then manually checked using the May 2004 assembly of the UCSC Genome Browser. Those having 100% homology of both STAT5 consensus sequences between humans, chimpanzees, mice, and rats were selected for subsequent analysis. Reporter Gene Construction—Human breast DNA (Bio-Chain, Hayward, CA) was amplified with primers spanning the conserved NCAM2 intronic region with the following sequences: ACACATCCTTCATACCAGGAAA and TGGCCACCTATTGGTTTCTATC. Amplification was done using Pfu Ultra (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), gel-purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and ligated into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO using the Zero Blunt TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). The NCAM2 intronic insert was then isolated by digesting with XhoI and HindIII (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), the fragments were gel-purified and ligated into XhoI/HindIII-digested pLuc-MCS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). STAT5a1*6 was subcloned into EcoRI/NotI-digested pIRES-puro3 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Mutagenesis and Sequencing—Mutagenesis was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutation of the first STAT5 consensus site in NCAM2 was made using the following primers: sense primer, 5′-GAAACGCTGCGTGAGGGAACTCAGAAGTCGCATGAC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GTCATGCGACTTCTGAGTTCCCTCACGCAGCGTTTC-3′. Mutation of the second site was made using the following: sense primer, 5′-CGTCAACTCTCAGGAATGGGAACTGAGAATTCCAAGTAAGAC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GTCTTACTTGGAATTCTCAGTTCCCATTCCTGAGAGTTGACG-3′. The bases that were changed from wild type are underlined. Miniprep DNA was isolated using a Qiagen DNA Miniprep kit. Sequencing was performed at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute Molecular Biology Core Facility. Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—5 × 104 T47D cells were transfected with 1 μg of firefly luciferase vector and 0.1 μg of Renilla luciferase vector (pRL-TK; Promega, Madison, WI) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml prolactin for 16 h, and luciferase activity was quantitated on a Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) using a dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 293 cells were transfected with 1 μg of firefly luciferase, 0.1 μg of Renilla, and 1 μg of pIRES puro or pIRES puro STAT5a1*6 and analyzed for luciferase expression 24 h after transfection. All firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase. Each reporter assay was performed in triplicate and was repeated in at least four different experiments. RT-PCR—RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was made using the Taqman reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative real time PCR was performed in triplicate using SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems) on a model 7500 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences were as follows: human NCAM2 (AGTGGCTCCAGTGGCAAA and GGCTCCCATCTTCGTGATTA), human IFN-γ (GAGTGTGGAGACCATCAAGGA and CATGTATTGCTTTGCGTTGG), human cytokine-inducible SH2 domain protein (CIS) (CTGCTGTGCATAGCCAAGAC and GTGCCTTCTGGCATCTTCTG), and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (AATCCCATCACCATCTTCCA and TGGACTCCACGACGTACTCA). Data are expressed as the mean -fold change ± S.E. of three replicates. Each assay was repeated at least twice. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Lysates were run on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked in 5% milk for 1 h, and incubated with the appropriate antibodies overnight. The blots were washed three times with TBST (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody for 1 h, washed three times with TBST, and developed using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP assays were performed as previously described (9Nelson E.A. Walker S.R. Alvarez J.V. Frank D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54724-54730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with the following changes. 0.37% formaldehyde was used for cross-linking, and sonication was performed using a Fisher sonic dismembranator, model 500, with five bursts of 15 s at a setting of 10%. 10 μg of tRNA and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin were included when the protein A/G beads were added to the immunoprecipitation. For semiquantitative PCR, the primers were as follows: human NCAM2 STAT5 binding region, ACACATCCTTCATACCAGGAAA and TGGCCACCTATTGGTTTCTATC; human NCAM2 negative control region, CTGCACATGATCCATCTTCAAT and CCAGCAATAACTAGGGCATCA. Quantitative real time PCR was performed using the following primers: human NCAM2 STAT5 binding region, ACTTGCATGGGTCACAACAC and CAGGCATGGGGTTGTCTTAC. Data from three replicates were normalized to input and expressed relative to nonspecific IgG. Each assay was performed at least twice. Identification of STAT5 Consensus Sites on Human Chromosomes 21 and 22—To identify novel STAT5 consensus sites, we chose to analyze chromosomes 21 and 22, which are the two smallest human chromosomes. Low stringency searches identified thousands of potential binding sites. Although many of these are probably true STAT binding sites, we increased our stringency to achieve an experimentally feasible number of STAT binding sites. We searched for the STAT5 consensus binding site TTCN3GAA (5Grimley P.M. Dong F. Rui H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 131-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 18Decker T.

Given that STAT5 can form tetramers and contact DNA at two binding sites (13Meyer W.K. Reichenbach P. Schindler U. Soldaini E. Nabholz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31821-31828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14John S. Vinkemeier U. Soldaini E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Leonard W.J. Mol.

Chretien S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5852-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we focused on regions that contained two STAT5 consensus sites. We identified 81 sites that met these criteria. Since functional STAT5 regulatory regions are likely to be conserved among diverse species, we further considered only those that had 100% homology at both STAT5 consensus sites between humans, chimpanzees, mice, and rats. Four regions were identified in this search, one near the 3′-end of an uncharacterized clone, accession number BC032403 (located on chromosome 21 at bases 36247794-36247969, May 2004, UCSC genome assembly), and a second ∼20 kb 3′ of the PCP4 gene, accession number X93349 (located on chromosome 21 at bases 40242743-40242862, May 2004, UCSC genome assembly). We also identified conserved STAT5 consensus sites within the promoter of the oncostatin M gene as well as the first intron of NCAM2. Oncostatin M has previously been reported to be a STAT5 target gene (20Yoshimura A. Ichihara M. Kinjyo I. Moriyama M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 21Ma Y. Streiff R.J. Liu J. Spence M.J. Vestal R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4649-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), demonstrating that this methodology identifies bona fide STAT5-regulated genes. NCAM2, by contrast, had not been known to be STAT5-responsive. Of note, NCAM2 is highly homologous to NCAM1 (CD56), which is an essential component of natural killer (NK) cell biology (22Becknell B. Caligiuri M.A. Adv. Immunol. 2005; 86: 209-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The cytokine IL-2, which is a key regulator of NK cell function, is known to be a potent activator of STAT5 (23Yu C.R. Lin J.X. Fink D.W. Akira S. Bloom E.T. Yamauchi A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 126-137PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it was plausible that NCAM2 would be a STAT5 target gene. Furthermore, STAT5 binding sites are often located in introns (9Nelson E.A. Walker S.R. Alvarez J.V. Frank D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54724-54730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the STAT5 binding sites identified in NCAM2 are found within the first intron of this gene (located on chromosome 21 at bases 21494503 to 21494577 of the May 2004 UCSC genome assembly) (Fig. 1). Therefore, we focused on understanding STAT5 regulation of NCAM2. NCAM2 Is Expressed in NKL Cells—To determine if NCAM2 is expressed in response to STAT5, we utilized NKL cells, which are an IL-2-dependent NK cell line (16Robertson M.J. Cochran K.J. Cameron C. Le J.M. Tantravahi R. Ritz J. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 406-415PubMed Google Scholar), in which both STAT5a and STAT5b can be inducibly activated (Fig. 2a). To determine if NCAM2 was expressed in NKL cells, we starved and then stimulated the cells with IL-2 and performed RT-PCR analysis. IL-2 stimulation caused a dramatic up-regulation of NCAM2 expression, with increased expression starting at 1 h and peak expression at 7 h (Fig. 2b). A dose response was performed, which shows that NCAM2 is induced with IL-2 concentrations as low as 0.05 units/ml, with peak NCAM2 expression levels as low as 5 units/ml (Fig. 2c). Therefore, IL-2, a cytokine that activates STAT5 in NKL cells, induces the expression of NCAM2. The NCAM2 Intronic Region Confers Transcriptional Responsiveness—To demonstrate that the two STAT5 consensus sites within the NCAM2 intron are functional, we inserted this region upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 3a). It is extremely difficult to introduce exogenous DNA into NKL cells by transfection or retroviral infection (data not shown). Thus, we utilized the human mammary tumor cell line T47D, in which STAT5 phosphorylation can be induced by prolactin (24Chughtai N. Schimchowitsch S. Lebrun J.J. Ali S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31107-31114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). When the reporter construct containing the NCAM2 intronic region was introduced into T47D cells, there was only a low level of luciferase activity compared with empty vector (Fig. 3b). However, when T47D cells were stimulated with prolactin, luciferase activity was induced 9.7-fold (Fig. 3b). To determine if this reporter activity was due directly to STAT5, we used a constitutively activated form of STAT5, STAT5a1*6 (25Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L.-F. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), and transfected this, in combination with the NCAM2 intronic luciferase construct, into 293 cells. Consistent with our observations in T47D cells, the construct containing the STAT5 consensus sites showed a 12.2-fold increase in luciferase activity when co-transfected with STAT5a1*6 when compared with cells co-transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 3c). Therefore, the highly conserved sequence in the first intron of NCAM2 confers STAT5 responsiveness. The STAT5 Consensus Sites in the NCAM2 Intronic Element Are Necessary for Transcriptional Activity—To determine the contribution of each STAT5 consensus site to the transcriptional activity of the NCAM2 intronic region, we mutated the first two nucleotides in each site and examined the ability of this mutated element to induce transcription using luciferase assays (Fig. 3a). Mutating either site individually resulted in a clear reduction in prolactin-induced luciferase activity, from 14.5-fold for the wild type construct, to 2.6-fold for site 1 and 2.4-fold for site 2 (Fig. 3d). When both sites were mutated in the same construct, prolactin-induced luciferase expression was completely abolished (Fig. 3d). Thus, the two STAT5 consensus sites confer transcriptional activity, and mutations in these sites abolish this activity. STAT5 Binds to the NCAM2 Intronic Region in Vivo—The NCAM2 gene is expressed after activation of STAT5, and the region containing the two STAT5 consensus sites in the NCAM2 intron shows STAT5-dependent transcriptional activity. To demonstrate that the NCAM2 intronic element functions as a STAT5 binding region in vivo, we performed a ChIP assay, which has the advantage of allowing an analysis of the binding activity of a transcription factor in living cells. Given that STAT5a and STAT5b often bind to the same region (9Nelson E.A. Walker S.R. Alvarez J.V. Frank D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54724-54730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine if both could bind the NCAM2 intronic element. Thus, we performed ChIP using antibodies specific for STAT5a and STAT5b, which revealed that both STAT5 proteins were inducibly bound to this element (Fig. 4a). To exclude the possibility that STAT5 was binding nonspecifically, we designed PCR primers to a region of low homology ∼4 kb from the identified STAT5 binding site (chromosome 21, bases 21498297-21498518 of the May 2004 UCSC genome assembly). Using these primers, no DNA was amplified from a ChIP of STAT5a and STAT5b (Fig. 4a). This further demonstrates that STAT5 binding to the region of homology in the NCAM2 intron is specific to this site. Therefore, STAT5 binds to a region containing two highly conserved STAT5 consensus sites within the first intron of the NCAM2 gene, and this binding is dependent upon IL-2 activation of STAT5. RNA Polymerase II and p300 Are Recruited to the Intronic Element—Having shown that STAT5 is inducibly bound to the NCAM2 intronic element after IL-2 stimulation, we wanted to determine if other components of the transcriptional apparatus are recruited to this site. Therefore, we performed ChIP assays using antibodies to Pol II, a component of the basal transcriptional machinery, and p300, a known coactivator of STAT5-mediated transcription (26Pfitzner E. Jahne R. Wissler M. Stoecklin E. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as an antibody that recognizes both STAT5a and STAT5b (total STAT5). Although far from the 5′-end of the gene, both Pol II and p300 were recruited to the NCAM2 intronic element coincident with STAT5 binding (Fig. 4b). Thus, IL-2 activation not only recruits STAT5 to this region of NCAM2 containing conserved STAT5 consensus sites, but IL-2 activation also causes the recruitment of other components of STAT5-mediated transcription as well. The recruitment of Pol II and p300 further demonstrates that functional STAT5 regulatory regions are found outside of traditional promoter regions. Neither STAT1 nor STAT3 Bind to the NCAM2 Intronic Region—Since other STAT proteins share the TTCN3GAA STAT consensus binding site, we wanted to determine if other STATs are able to bind to the NCAM2 intronic region. In addition to activating STAT5, IL-2 activates STAT1 and STAT3 (27Frank D.A. Robertson M. Bonni A. Ritz J. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7779-7783Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To determine whether each of these STATs can bind to the NCAM2 intronic region, we performed ChIP analysis on IL-2-treated NKL cells, using antibodies specific for STAT1, STAT3, or total STAT5. Although IL-2 treatment resulted in the robust accumulation of total STAT5 on the NCAM2 intronic element, there was no significant recruitment of STAT1 or STAT3 after IL-2 treatment (Fig. 5). Thus, although multiple STATs can be activated by IL-2 in NKL cells, only STAT5 binds inducibly to the NCAM2 intronic element. IFN-α Induces NCAM2 Expression—To understand the physiological significance of NCAM2 induction, we analyzed STAT activation in response to other cytokines in NKL cells. Although competent to activate STAT1 and STAT3 in other cells, neither IFN-γ nor IL-6 activated these STATs in NKL cells (Fig. 6a). IL-10 activated only STAT1 and STAT3 (Fig. 6a), whereas IFN-α activated STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, and STAT5 (28Cho S.S. Bacon C.M. Sudarshan C. Rees R.C. Finbloom D. Pine R. O'Shea J.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4781-4789PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, a and b). We then determined if treatment with these cytokines also leads to the expression of NCAM2 in NKL cells. IL-10 stimulation did not lead to NCAM2 expression; nor did it enhance IL-2-mediated expression of this gene (Fig. 6c). However, IFN-α treatment resulted in robust NCAM2 expression with kinetics similar to, although slightly faster than, IL-2 treatment (Fig. 6d). To determine the composition of STATs that were bound to the NCAM2 intronic element in response to IFN-α, we performed ChIP analysis using antibodies specific for the various STATs. As with IL-2, IFN-α treatment does not lead to the recruitment of STAT1 or STAT3 to the NCAM2 intronic element (data not shown). However, IFN-α treatment resulted in the recruitment of both STAT4 and STAT5 (Fig. 7). Therefore, although IL-2 and IFN-α activate multiple STATs in NKL cells, only STAT4 and STAT5 bind inducibly to the NCAM2 intronic element. NCAM2 Expression Is Enhanced by the Combination of IL-2 and IFN-α—Both IL-2 and IFN-α stimulation result in expression of NCAM2, yet the composition of STATs that are recruited to this regulatory element diff"

https://openalex.org/W1975227322,"Interaction of CD8 (CD8αα or CD8αβ) with the peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (pMHCI) is critical for the development and function of cytolytic T cells. Although the crystal structure of CD8αα·pMHCI complex revealed that two symmetric CD8α subunits interact with pMHCI asymmetrically, with one subunit engaged in more extensive interaction than the other, the details of the interaction between the CD8αβ heterodimer and pMHCI remained unknown. The Ig-like domains of mouse CD8αβ and CD8αα are similar in the size, shape, and surface electrostatic potential of their pMHCI-binding regions, suggesting that their interactions with pMHCI could be very similar. Indeed, we found that the CD8α variants CD8αR8A and CD8αE27A, which were functionally inactive as homodimers, could form an active co-receptor with wild-type (WT) CD8β as a CD8αR8Aβ or CD8αE27Aβ heterodimer. We also identified CD8β variants that could form active receptors with WT CD8α but not with CD8αR8A. This observation is consistent with the notion that the CD8β subunit may replace either CD8α subunit in CD8αα·pMHCI complex. In addition, we showed that both anti-CD8α and anti-CD8β antibodies were unable to completely block the co-receptor activity of WT CD8αβ. We propose that CD8αβ binds to pMHCI in at least two distinguishable orientations.

Immunol. 2002; 14: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although CD8αβ is expressed primarily on the surface of αβTCR+ thymocytes and peripheral T cells, CD8αα has a much broader expression pattern, including the αβTCR+ and γδTCR+ intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells (9Konig R.

CD8αβ has been shown to be a more efficient co-receptor than CD8αα for presentation of a given antigen (12Renard V. Romero P. Vivier E. Malissen B. Luescher I.F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2439-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 13Wheeler C.J. Chen Y.F. Potter T.A. Parnes J.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4199-4207PubMed Google Scholar, 14Witte T. Spoerl R. Chang H.C. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism for the enhanced efficiency is not well understood.Both the extracellular domain and the cytoplasmic tail of the CD8β subunit have been implicated in providing increased efficiency of CD8αβ (12Renard V. Romero P. Vivier E. Malissen B. Luescher I.F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2439-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 13Wheeler C.J. Chen Y.F. Potter T.A. Parnes J.R. J.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 409-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We reported previously that the extracellular domain of the CD8β subunit is critical for this enhanced efficiency (14Witte T. Spoerl R. Chang H.C. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and that introduction of the CD8β stalk region is sufficient to confer a CD8αβ-like co-receptor efficiency to the CD8αα homodimer (17Wong J.S. Wang X. Witte T. Nie L. Carvou N. Kern P. Chang H.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, the sialylation of the O-linked glycans in the CD8β stalk region is differentiation stage-dependent and may modulate the intrinsic activity of CD8αβ during the transition from double-positive (CD4+CD8+) to single-positive (CD8+) T cells (18Priatel J.J.

It was also reported that palmitoylation of a membrane-proximal cysteine residue in the cytoplasmic tail of CD8β during T-cell activation facilitates partition of CD8αβ heterodimers into lipid rafts, where it associates with the CD3 component of TCR complexes (20Arcaro A. Gregoire C. Bakker T.R. Baldi L. Jordan M. Goffin L. Boucheron N. Wurm F. van der Merwe P.A. Malissen B. Luescher I.F. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1485-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Lastly, the kinase activity of p56lck, which is associated only with the cytoplasmic domain of CD8α, can be enhanced by CD8β (21Irie H.Y. Mong M. Itano A. Crooks C. Littman D. Burakoff B. Robey E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the extracellular domain and the cytoplasmic tail of CD8β may independently contribute to the enhanced co-receptor activity of CD8αβ.The interaction of CD8αα and pMHCI has been elucidated through x-ray analyses of the crystal structures of human CD8αα·HLA-A2 and mouse CD8αα·H2-Kb (22Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 23Kern P.S. Teng M.K. Smolyar A.

This structural information confirms the results of many mutational studies. The complementarity-determining region-like loops of CD8αα and the MHCI α3 domain CD loop (residues 220–228) are the most critical for CD8αα·pMHCI interaction (24Sun J. Kavathas P.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6077-6082PubMed Google Scholar, 25Salter R.D. Benjamin R.J. Wesley P.K. Buxton S.E. Garrett T.P. Clayberger C. Krensky A.M. Norment A.M. Littman D.R. Parham P.

A. 1990; 87: 2137-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In both human and mouse CD8αα·pMHCI complexes, two symmetric CD8α subunits clamp asymmetrically onto the relatively rigid MHCI α3 domain CD loop. One subunit, CD8α1, is involved in more than 70% of the total interaction surface between CD8αα and the MHCI α3 domain and β2-microglobulin (β2M). The second subunit, CD8α2, is less engaged and interacts only with the MHCI α3 domain (22Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 23Kern P.S. Teng M.K. Smolyar A. Liu J.H. Liu J. Hussey R.E. Spoerl R. Chang H.C. Reinherz E.L. Wang J.H. Immunity. 1998; 9: 519-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To simplify reference to these interaction sites, we designated the site occupied by the CD8α1 subunit of CD8αα·pMHCI as site 1 and the site occupied by the CD8α2 subunit as site 2.Unlike CD8αα·pMHCI, the structure of CD8αβ·pMHCI is not known. Two different binding models have been proposed for the interaction of pMHCI with mouse and human CD8αβ (22Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 23Kern P.S. Teng M.K. Smolyar A. Liu J.H. Liu J. Hussey R.E. Spoerl R. Chang H.C. Reinherz E.L. Wang J.H. Immunity. 1998; 9: 519-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Considering that the stalk region of CD8α is longer than that of CD8β (44 versus 35 amino acids), which allows the Ig-like domain of CD8α to extend farther from the T-cell surface, we proposed a binding mode for mouse CD8αβ·pMHCI interaction in which CD8β and CD8α occupy site 1 and site 2, respectively (23Kern P.S. Teng M.K. Smolyar A. Liu J.H. Liu J. Hussey R.E. Spoerl R. Chang H.C. Reinherz E.L. Wang J.H. Immunity. 1998; 9: 519-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model is our observation that co-expression of WT CD8β with the CD8αR8A variant resulted in co-receptor activity indistinguishable from that of WT CD8αβ (17Wong J.S. Wang X. Witte T. Nie L. Carvou N. Kern P. Chang H.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because mouse CD8αR8A lacks the side chain of Arg8 critical for engaging in extensive interaction with pMHCI (site 1 interaction), the functional CD8αR8Aβ heterodimer must bind to pMHCI with its β subunit occupying site 1 and its α subunit (CD8αR8A) occupying site 2. On the other hand, based on electrostatic interactions between modeled human CD8αβ and pMHCI, Gao et al. (22Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) proposed that in the human CD8αβ·pMHCI complex, the CD8α subunit occupies site 1, and the CD8β subunit occupies site 2. Interestingly, like mouse CD8αR8A, human CD8αR4K and CD8αL25A are not able to form functional homodimeric co-receptor (34Devine L. Sun J. Barr M.R. Kavathas P.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 846-851PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, unlike the mouse CD8αR8A variant, neither of these human CD8α variants is able to form functional heterodimeric co-receptor with WT CD8β (34Devine L. Sun J. Barr M.R. Kavathas P.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 846-851PubMed Google Scholar). This observation led to the conclusion that in the human CD8αβ·pMHCI complex, the CD8α subunit occupies only site 1 (34Devine L. Sun J. Barr M.R. Kavathas P.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 846-851PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the interactions between CD8αβ and pMHCI in mouse and human systems appear to be different. The molecular basis for this difference remains unclear.To further understand the interaction between CD8αβ and pMHCI and possibly resolve the apparently conflicting observations in human and mouse systems, we asked, in the context of CD8αβ·pMHCI complex, whether mouse CD8β could also occupy site 2. Among a panel of CD8β variants that were unable to occupy site 1, we identified two CD8β variants that were capable of forming functional co-receptor with WT CD8α. Therefore, the mouse CD8β subunit can also occupy site 2 in the CD8αβ·pMHCI complex. In addition, we showed that an anti-CD8α antibody only blocked activity of co-receptors in which CD8α was occupying site 1 but not site 2. These results support the notion that CD8αβ interacts with pMHCI in at least two distinguishable binding orientations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESmAbs and Flow Cytometry—All of the mAbs used in the indirect flow cytometric analyses and mAb inhibition assays are described previously (17Wong J.S. Wang X. Witte T. Nie L. Carvou N. Kern P. Chang H.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Kern P.S. Teng M.K. Smolyar A. Liu J.H. Liu J. Hussey R.E. Spoerl R. Chang H.C. Reinherz E.L. Wang J.H. Immunity. 1998; 9: 519-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Constructs of Mouse CD8α and CD8β Variants and N15 Transfectants Expressing CD8 Variants—We generated alanine-substituted mouse CD8 variants, including CD8αE27A, CD8βK55A, CD8βS101A, and CD8βK103A, using the PCR-based mutagenesis (14Witte T. Spoerl R. Chang H.C. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cell lines expressing variant CD8αE27AαE27A or CD8αE27Aβ were generated by transfecting the CD8αE27A cDNA alone or together with WT CD8β into the N15 CD8– cell line as described (14Witte T. Spoerl R. Chang H.C. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For the cell lines expressing CD8αR8Aβvar or CD8αβvar heterodimers, the CD8αR8A or WT CD8α cDNA was transfected pairwise with each CD8β variant cDNA, βK55A, βS101A, or βK103A, into the N15 CD8– cell line. The resulting transfectants were tested for surface expression of TCRβ (detected by anti-TCR Vβ5.2 mAb MR9.4), CD8α (by anti-CD8α mAb 53.6.72), and CD8β (by anti-CD8β mAb YTS156) proteins, and positive clones were combined (minimum of 20 independent clones) and sorted for similar levels of surface expression.Analyses of Co-receptor Activity by IL-2 Production and Inhibition of Co-receptor Activity by Anti-CD8 mAbs—IL-2 production by various N15 CD8+ transfectants triggered by antigen stimulation was quantified by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assay described previously (17Wong J.S. Wang X. Witte T. Nie L. Carvou N. Kern P. Chang H.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 × 105 R8 antigen-presenting cells loaded with 10–9 – 10–4 m vesicular stomatitis virus octapeptide was incubated with an equal number of N15 transfectants expressing CD8 variants plus 10 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate for 24 h. Inhibition of co-receptor activity by anti-CD8 mAb was analyzed by the IL-2 assay. Briefly, 10 μg of affinity-purified anti-CD8α mAb H59, anti-CD8β mAb YTS156, or control mAb 2H11 was added to transfectants at 4 °C for 30 min before incubation with peptide-loaded antigen-presenting cells. IL-2 induced in the supernatant by antigen stimulation was quantified by IL-2-dependent growth of CTLL20 cells. N15 transfectants treated with anti-CD3ϵ mAb 145.2C11 were used as a positive control for T-cell activation. Recombinant human IL-2 (Chiron, Emeryville, CA) was used as an IL-2 standard.RESULTSStructural Basis for CD8β Occupancy of Both Site 1 and Site 2—The overall protein architecture of CD8αβ is similar to that of CD8αα (22Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 23Kern P.S. Teng M.K. Smolyar A.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 519-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and resembles the Ig-variable domain fragment of an antibody (Fig. 1A). Despite the low degree of protein sequence identity between CD8α and CD8β (Fig. 1C), superimposing their structures reveals only limited differences in the loop regions, including the CDR1- and CDR2-like loops (Fig. 1B). The CDR-like loops are involved in ligand binding and are expected to be more variable than other regions. However, the nine residues that are identical in human and mouse CD8α and CD8β are important for maintaining an Ig-fold structure and dimeric interface (7Chang H.C. Tan K. Ouyang J. Parisini E. Liu J.H. Le Y. Wang X. Reinherz E.L. Wang J.H. Immunity. 2005; 23: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This conservation ensures similarity in the overall structure of α and β subunits (Fig. 1B). The apparent structural similarity between CD8α and CD8β raises the possibility that CD8αβ·pMHCI interactions may be very similar to those of CD8αα·pMHCI, with the β subunit replacing either one of the α subunits in CD8αα·pMHCI complex.CD8β Subunit of Heterodimeric CD8αE27Aβ Occupies Site 1—We recently showed that CD8αR8Aβ is functionally active (17Wong J.S. Wang X. Witte T. Nie L. Carvou N. Kern P. Chang H.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Chang H.C. Smolyar A. Spoerl R. Witte T. Yao Y. Goyarts E.C. Nathenson S.G. Reinherz E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 278-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This suggests that Arg8 residue of the CD8α subunit is dispensable for the co-receptor function of CD8αR8Aβ. The Arg8 is not only critical for the ability of CD8α to occupy site 1 but is also the antigenic epitope recognized by mAb H59 (17Wong J.S. Wang X. Witte T. Nie L. Carvou N. Kern P. Chang H.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that mAb H59 blocks the interaction of pMHCI and CD8α1 but not that of pMHCI and CD8α2. If so, mAb H59 would be expected to block the co-receptor activity of CD8αα but not that of CD8αR8Aβ. However, as the binding epitope of mAb H59 is lost in CD8αR8A (17Wong J.S. Wang X. Witte T. Nie L. Carvou N. Kern P. Chang H.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), this variant is not suitable for performing the antibody blocking experiment. Because both Arg8 and Glu27 form hydrogen bonds with Lys58 of β2M in the crystal complex of CD8αα·H-2Kb (Fig. 1, D and E), we engineered a substitute variant, CD8αE27A, and tested whether, like CD8αR8Aβ, CD8αE27Aβ is functionally active. Fig. 2A shows that despite comparable surface expression levels of CD8 and TCR among the CD8 transfectants, cells expressing CD8αE27AαE27A exhibit co-receptor activity about 1000-fold less efficiently than cells expressing WT CD8αα (Fig. 2B). Thus, like CD8αR8AαR8A, CD8αE27AαE27A is incapable of interacting productively with pMHCI. In addition, the co-receptor activity of CD8αE27Aβ is indistinguishable from that of WT CD8αβ (Fig. 2C). Therefore, similar to CD8αR8Aβ, CD8αE27Aβ can productively engage with pMHCI. mAb H59 binds to cells expressing WT CD8αβ and CD8αE27Aβ variants (Fig. 2A) indicating that the binding epitope of mAb H59 is retained. Fig. 2E shows that mAb H59 completely inhibits the co-receptor activity of CD8αα, yet it does not affect that of CD8αE27Aβ (Fig. 2D). We also tested the co-receptor activity of CD8αE27Aβ in the presence of an anti-CD8β mAb YTS156. In contrast to mAb H59, mAb YTS156 completely blocks the activity of CD8αE27Aβ (Fig. 2D).FIGURE 2CD8β subunit of heterodimeric CD8αE27A β occupies site 1.

VSV8, vesicular stomatitis virus octapeptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The fact that mAb H59 has no effect on the co-receptor activity of CD8αE27Aβ is consistent with the prediction that the interaction between the MHCI α3 domain and site 2-occupying CD8αE27A is minimal, and the binding of mAb H59 does not compromise the productive interaction between CD8αE27A and pMHCI. Conversely, the complete inhibition of the co-receptor activity of CD8αE27Aβ by mAb YTS156 indicates that heterodimeric CD8αE27Aβ is responsible for all observed co-receptor activity. As CD8αE27A is no longer capable of occupying site 1, these results indicate that in the CD8αE27Aβ·pMHCI complex, the CD8β subunit occupies site 1. Significantly, the “all-or-none” inhibitory effect of mAb YTS156 and mAb H59 on the co-receptor activity of CD8αE27Aβ suggests that the occupation of site 1 by CD8β is the only binding mode in the interaction between CD8αE27Aβ and pMHCI.CD8β Subunit of Heterodimeric CD8αβvar Occupies Site 2—Because CD8αR8Aβ and CD8αE27Aβ interacted with pMHCI in only one orientation, the CD8αR8A co-transfection system also provided a measure to identify residues of CD8β that were critical for CD8β being able to occupy site 1. We recently reported that the Lys55 in the CDR2-like loop and also Ser101 and Lys103 in the CD8β CDR3-like loop is critical for the co-receptor activity of CD8αR8Aβ, as co-expression of each of these CD8β variants with CD8αR8A does not lead to detectable co-receptor activity (28Chang H.C. Smolyar A. Spoerl R. Witte T. Yao Y. Goyarts E.C. Nathenson S.G. Reinherz E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 278-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In light of the observation that heterodimeric CD8αR8Aβ is functionally active (17Wong J.S. Wang X. Witte T. Nie L. Carvou N. Kern P. Chang H.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we questioned whether each of these CD8β variants can form a functional co-receptor with WT CD8α. The co-receptor activity of the CD8αβvar would indicate that each of these CD8β variants could occupy site 2 and form active co-receptors with site 1-occupying WT CD8α. We found that cell lines expressing similar levels of CD8α and CD8β, CD8βK55A, CD8βS101A, or CD8βK103A proteins on the cell surface (data not shown) exhibited co-receptor activity (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that the heterodimeric CD8αβvar can productively interact with pMHCI.FIGURE 3CD8β subunit of CD8αβvar occupies site 2.

VSV8, vesicular stomatitis virus octapeptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)However, WT CD8α can form functional CD8αα homodimers in these transfectants (17Wong J.S. Wang X. Witte T. Nie L. Carvou N. Kern P. Chang H.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and contribute to the observed co-receptor activity (Fig. 3A). We reported previously that the co-receptor activity of WT CD8αβ and CD8αα can be triggered by peptide antigen at concentrations of 10–9 and 10–7 m, respectively (14Witte T. Spoerl R. Chang H.C. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, the CD8αβvar heterodimers are likely to be functionally active if cells expressing CD8α and CD8βvar are responsive to peptide antigen at a concentration lower than 10–7 m. Fig. 3A shows that cells expressing CD8α and CD8βK55A or CD8βK103A is responsive to peptide antigen at a concentration of 10–8 m. This result suggests that heterodimeric CD8αβK55A and CD8αβK103A are functionally active. Because cells expressing CD8α and CD8βS101A exhibited a CD8αα-like antigen sensitivity of ∼10–7 m, it appears that CD8αβS101A was not functionally active.To further verify that CD8αβK55A and CD8αβK103A are indeed functionally active, we also examined their co-receptor activity in the presence of anti-CD8β mAb YTS156 or anti-CD8α mAb H59. Because mAb YTS156 is β chain-specific, it is expected to block the activity of the CD8αβvar heterodimeric co-receptor. Conversely, mAb H59, which is specific for the α chain, would block the co-receptor activity associated with CD8αα homodimers and CD8αβvar heterodimers in which CD8α subunits occupy site 1. Fig. 3B shows that mAb YTS156 was able to block some co-receptor activity associated with cells transfected with WT CD8α and CD8βK55A, indicating that CD8αβK55A is indeed a contributor to that activity. Similar results were obtained from the cell line expressing WT CD8α and CD8αβK103A (Fig. 3C). Thus, although CD8βK55A and CD8βK103A are unable to occupy site 1 (7Chang H.C. Tan K. Ouyang J. Parisini E. Liu J.H. Le Y. Wang X. Reinherz E.L. Wang J.H. Immunity. 2005; 23: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), they are capable of forming functional co-receptors with WT CD8α by occupying site 2. Surprisingly, very little, if any, co-receptor activity associated with cells expressing CD8α and CD8βS101A is inhibited by mAb YTS156 (Fig. 3D), indicating that CD8αβS101A does not contribute to the co-receptor activity shown in A. This is consistent with the observation that these cells exhibit CD8αα-like antigen sensitivity (10–7 m). In contrast to mAb YTS156, mAb H59 completely blocks the co-receptor activity in all three cell lines (Fig. 3, B–D) suggesting that all functional co-receptors expressed must interact with pMHCI with a CD8α subunit occupying site 1 and that the portion of co-receptor activity that cannot be blocked by mAb YTS156 is contributed by CD8αα. These results show that the β subunit of heterodimeric CD8αβK55A or CD8αβK103A occupies site 2.Wild-type CD8αβ Heterodimer Has Two Distinct Binding Modes—Using variants of CD8α or CD8β, we are able to restrict the interaction between each of these heterodimeric variants and pMHCI in only one orientation. It would be important to determine whether the WT CD8αβ heterodimer indeed interacts with pMHCI in both orientations. We analyzed the inhibitory effect of mAb H59 and mAb YTS156 on the co-receptor activity of WT CD8αβ. Three possible CD8·pMHCI complexes were expected: CD8αα· pMHCI, CD8αβ·pMHCI with the α subunit occupying site 1, and CD8αβ·pMHCI with the β subunit occupying site 1 (Fig. 4A). mAb H59 was expected to block the first two complexes but not the third. mAb H59 did not block all of the co-receptor activities (Fig. 4B), indicating that CD8αβ·pMHCI interaction with CD8α occupying site 2 contributed at least some co-receptor activity. Because mAb YTS156 inhibited the activity of CD8αβ complexed with pMHCI in either orientation (Figs. 2 and 3), the CD8αα homodimers were responsible for the co-receptor activity that was not affected by this antibody. These results are in agreement with our proposal that WT CD8αβ can bind to the pMHCI complex in at least two distinct modes, one sensitive and the other insensitive to inhibition by mAb H59.FIGURE 4Wild-type CD8αβ binds to pMHCI in two distinct orientations.
