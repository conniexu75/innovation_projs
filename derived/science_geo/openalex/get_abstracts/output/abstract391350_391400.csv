Profiling of histone modifications and chromatin regulators in human embryonic stem cells now reveals unique signatures that are used to identify more than 2,000 putative enhancers. These enhancers are either active in the embryonic stem cells or are associated with early developmental genes. Identifying the genomic regulatory sequences, such as enhancers, that control early embryonic development remains a difficult challenge. Here, profiling of histone modifications and chromatin regulators in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) reveals unique signatures that are used to identify over 2,000 putative enhancers. These enhancers are either active in the h ESCs or associated with early developmental genes. Cell-fate transitions involve the integration of genomic information encoded by regulatory elements, such as enhancers, with the cellular environment1,2. However, identification of genomic sequences that control human embryonic development represents a formidable challenge3. Here we show that in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), unique chromatin signatures identify two distinct classes of genomic elements, both of which are marked by the presence of chromatin regulators p300 and BRG1, monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1), and low nucleosomal density. In addition, elements of the first class are distinguished by the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), overlap with previously characterized hESC enhancers, and are located proximally to genes expressed in hESCs and the epiblast. In contrast, elements of the second class, which we term ‘poised enhancers’, are distinguished by the absence of H3K27ac, enrichment of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and are linked to genes inactive in hESCs and instead are involved in orchestrating early steps in embryogenesis, such as gastrulation, mesoderm formation and neurulation. Consistent with the poised identity, during differentiation of hESCs to neuroepithelium, a neuroectoderm-specific subset of poised enhancers acquires a chromatin signature associated with active enhancers. When assayed in zebrafish embryos, poised enhancers are able to direct cell-type and stage-specific expression characteristic of their proximal developmental gene, even in the absence of sequence conservation in the fish genome. Our data demonstrate that early developmental enhancers are epigenetically pre-marked in hESCs and indicate an unappreciated role of H3K27me3 at distal regulatory elements. Moreover, the wealth of new regulatory sequences identified here provides an invaluable resource for studies and isolation of transient, rare cell populations representing early stages of human embryogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2123004778,"Eukaryotic organisms have developed diverse mechanisms for the acquisition of iron, which is required for their survival. Graminaceous plants use a chelation strategy. They secrete phytosiderophore compounds, which solubilize iron in the soil, and then take up the resulting iron-phytosiderophore complexes. Bacteria and mammals also secrete siderophores to acquire iron. Although phytosiderophore secretion is crucial for plant growth, its molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we show that the efflux of deoxymugineic acid, the primary phytosiderophore from rice and barley, involves the TOM1 and HvTOM1 genes, respectively. Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing TOM1 or HvTOM1 released (14)C-labeled deoxymugineic acid but not (14)C-labeled nicotianamine, a structural analog and biosynthetic precursor of deoxymugineic acid, indicating that the TOM1 and HvTOM1 proteins are the phytosiderophore efflux transporters. Under conditions of iron deficiency, rice and barley roots express high levels of TOM1 and HvTOM1, respectively, and the overexpression of these genes increased tolerance to iron deficiency. In rice roots, the efficiency of deoxymugineic acid secretion was enhanced by overexpression of TOM1 and decreased by its repression, providing further evidence that TOM1 encodes the efflux transporter of deoxymugineic acid. We have also identified two genes encoding efflux transporters of nicotianamine, ENA1 and ENA2. Our identification of phytosiderophore efflux transporters has revealed the final piece in the molecular machinery of iron acquisition in graminaceous plants."

FoxO transcription factors are critical mediators of oxidative stress resistance in multiple cell types, but cardioprotective functions have not been reported previously. FoxO function in oxidative stress resistance was investigated in cultured cardiomyocytes and in mice with cardiomyocyte-specific combined deficiency of FoxO1 and FoxO3 subjected to myocardial infarction (MI) or acute ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Induction of oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes promotes FoxO1 and FoxO3 nuclear localization and target gene activation. Infection of cardiomyocytes with a dominant-negative FoxO1(Δ256) adenovirus results in a significant increase in reactive oxygen species and cell death, whereas increased FoxO1 or FoxO3 expression reduces reactive oxygen species and cell death. Mice generated with combined conditional deletion of FoxO1 and FoxO3 specifically in cardiomyocytes were subjected to I/R or MI. Loss of FoxO1 and FoxO3 in cardiomyocytes results in a significant increase in infarct area with decreased expression of the antiapoptotic molecules, PTEN-induced kinase1 (PINK1) and CBP/P300-interacting transactivator (CITED2). Expressions of the antioxidants catalase and manganese superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2) and the autophagy-related proteins LC3II and Gabarapl1 also are decreased following I/R compared with controls. Mice with cardiomyocyte-specific FoxO deficiency subjected to MI have reduced cardiac function, increased scar formation, induction of stress-responsive signaling, and increased apoptotic cell death relative to controls. These data support a critical role for FoxOs in promoting cardiomyocyte survival during conditions of oxidative stress through induction of antioxidants and cell survival pathways.

https://openalex.org/W1992306108,"With more than 55,000 members identified so far in all forms of life, the family of terpene or terpenoid natural products represents the epitome of molecular biodiversity. A well-known and important member of this family is the polycyclic diterpenoid Taxol (paclitaxel), which promotes tubulin polymerization and shows remarkable efficacy in cancer chemotherapy. The first committed step of Taxol biosynthesis in the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia) is the cyclization of the linear isoprenoid substrate geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) to form taxa-4(5),11(12)diene, which is catalysed by taxadiene synthase. The full-length form of this diterpene cyclase contains 862 residues, but a roughly 80-residue amino-terminal transit sequence is cleaved on maturation in plastids. We now report the X-ray crystal structure of a truncation variant lacking the transit sequence and an additional 27 residues at the N terminus, hereafter designated TXS. Specifically, we have determined structures of TXS complexed with 13-aza-13,14-dihydrocopalyl diphosphate (1.82 Å resolution) and 2-fluorogeranylgeranyl diphosphate (2.25 Å resolution). The TXS structure reveals a modular assembly of three α-helical domains. The carboxy-terminal catalytic domain is a class I terpenoid cyclase, which binds and activates substrate GGPP with a three-metal ion cluster. The N-terminal domain and a third 'insertion' domain together adopt the fold of a vestigial class II terpenoid cyclase. A class II cyclase activates the isoprenoid substrate by protonation instead of ionization, and the TXS structure reveals a definitive connection between the two distinct cyclase classes in the evolution of terpenoid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2005481246,"WNT4, a member of the Wnt family of ligands, is critical for the development of the female reproductive tract. Analysis of Wnt4 expression in the adult uterus during pregnancy indicates that it may play a role in the regulation of endometrial stromal cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation, which is required to support the developing embryo. To investigate the role of Wnt4 in adult uterine physiology, conditional ablation of Wnt4 using the PR(cre) mouse model was accomplished. Ablation of Wnt4 rendered female mice subfertile due to a defect in embryo implantation and subsequent defects in endometrial stromal cell survival, differentiation, and responsiveness to progesterone signaling. In addition to altered stromal cell function, the uteri of PR(cre/+)Wnt4(f/f) (Wnt4(d/d)) mice displayed altered epithelial differentiation characterized by a reduction in the number of uterine glands and the emergence of a p63-positive basal cell layer beneath the columnar luminal epithelial cells. The altered epithelial cell phenotype was further escalated by chronic estrogen treatment, which caused squamous cell metaplasia of the uterine epithelium in the Wnt4(d/d) mice. Thus, WNT4 is a critical regulator not only of proper postnatal uterine development, but also embryo implantation and decidualization."
https://openalex.org/W2034718433,"The loss of a classical non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair factor, XLF, shows strong effects in non-lymphoid cells, but in lymphoid cells its absence surprisingly has only modest effects on V(D)J recombination. Frederick Alt and colleagues show that in lymphoid cells, two other repair factors — ATM kinase and histone protein H2AX — have functional redundancy with XLF. Thus, mice that are deficient in both ATM and XLF have compromised conventional NHEJ, although alternative end-joining is retained. The results hint that the redundant function in end-joining that XLF has with both ATM and H2AX may be related to a role for ATM in chromatin accessibility. Although loss of XLF, a classical non-homologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) repair factor, shows strong effects in non-lymphoid cells, in lymphoid cells its absence has only modest effects on V(D)J recombination. This study now shows that in lymphoid cells, two other repair factors — ATM kinase and histone protein H2AX — have functional redundancy with XLF. Thus, mice deficient in both ATM and XLF have compromised conventional NHEJ, although alternative end-joining is retained. The results hint that the redundant function in end-joining that XLF has with both ATM and H2AX may have to do with an ATM role in chromatin accessibility. Classical non-homologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) is a major mammalian DNA double-strand-break (DSB) repair pathway. Deficiencies for classical NHEJ factors, such as XRCC4, abrogate lymphocyte development, owing to a strict requirement for classical NHEJ to join V(D)J recombination DSB intermediates1,2. The XRCC4-like factor (XLF; also called NHEJ1) is mutated in certain immunodeficient human patients and has been implicated in classical NHEJ3,4,5,6; however, XLF-deficient mice have relatively normal lymphocyte development and their lymphocytes support normal V(D)J recombination5. The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein (ATM) detects DSBs and activates DSB responses by phosphorylating substrates including histone H2AX7. However, ATM deficiency causes only modest V(D)J recombination and lymphocyte developmental defects, and H2AX deficiency does not have a measurable impact on these processes7,8,9. Here we show that XLF, ATM and H2AX all have fundamental roles in processing and joining DNA ends during V(D)J recombination, but that these roles have been masked by unanticipated functional redundancies. Thus, combined deficiency of ATM and XLF nearly blocks mouse lymphocyte development due to an inability to process and join chromosomal V(D)J recombination DSB intermediates. Combined XLF and ATM deficiency also severely impairs classical NHEJ, but not alternative end-joining, during IgH class switch recombination. Redundant ATM and XLF functions in classical NHEJ are mediated by ATM kinase activity and are not required for extra-chromosomal V(D)J recombination, indicating a role for chromatin-associated ATM substrates. Correspondingly, conditional H2AX inactivation in XLF-deficient pro-B lines leads to V(D)J recombination defects associated with marked degradation of unjoined V(D)J ends, revealing that H2AX has a role in this process."

To elucidate the structural basis of Aβ toxicity, we developed different procedures to isolate Aβ species of defined size and morphology distribution, and we investigated their toxicity in different cell lines and primary neurons. We observed that crude Aβ42 preparations, containing a monomeric and heterogeneous mixture of Aβ42 oligomers, were more toxic than purified monomeric, protofibrillar fractions, or fibrils. The toxicity of protofibrils was directly linked to their interactions with monomeric Aβ42 and strongly dependent on their ability to convert into amyloid fibrils. Subfractionation of protofibrils diminished their fibrillization and toxicity, whereas reintroduction of monomeric Aβ42 into purified protofibril fractions restored amyloid formation and enhanced their toxicity. Selective removal of monomeric Aβ42 from these preparations, using insulin-degrading enzyme, reversed the toxicity of Aβ42 protofibrils. Together, our findings demonstrate that Aβ42 toxicity is not linked to specific prefibrillar aggregate(s) but rather to the ability of these species to grow and undergo fibril formation, which depends on the presence of monomeric Aβ42. These findings contribute significantly to the understanding of amyloid formation and toxicity in Alzheimer disease, provide novel insight into mechanisms of Aβ protofibril toxicity, and important implications for designing anti-amyloid therapies.

During the course of in vitro Aβ fibril formation, various nonfibrillar aggregation intermediates, collectively called soluble oligomers or protofibrils, have been shown to precede the emergence of fibrils. Increasing evidence from various sources points to Aβ oligomers/protofibrils as putative toxic species in AD pathogenesis and suggests that these species are potential therapeutic targets for treating AD (reviewed in Refs. 9Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (3772) Google Scholar, 10Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. Protein Pept. Lett. 2004; 11: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Although the toxic oligomer hypothesis has emerged as one of the major current working hypotheses in AD research, the development of effective diagnostic tools and therapies on the basis of this hypothesis has yet to be realized (11Kodali R. Wetzel R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 12Lashuel H.A. Hartley D.M. Petre B.M. Wall J.S. Simon M.N. Walz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15157-15167Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This is partially due to the fact that identification of a single toxic Aβ species that correlates with AD progression and severity remains elusive. Furthermore, the exact mechanisms by which these species contribute to Aβ toxicity in vivo and the nature of the toxic species are not yet fully understood. Recent evidence suggests that accelerating the process of Aβ fibrillization greatly enhances Aβ toxicity in vitro (14Wogulis M. Wright S. Cunningham D. Chilcote T. Powell K. Rydel R.E. J.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15157-15167Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) have precluded the isolation of a single toxic species. Unless covalently cross-linked (23Bitan G. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 413: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), Aβ oligomers do not exist as stable entities, i.e. they evolve into higher order aggregates and, if they are on-pathway intermediates, convert into fibrils (19Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible to assume that the structural dynamics of oligomers and factors that govern their interconversion and/or growth might influence some of the disease-related cytotoxic effects of Aβ. In other words, an ongoing polymerization process involving the elongation and growth of oligomers, rather than the formation of a stable oligomeric species, may be responsible for Aβ toxicity and neurodegeneration in AD. To test this hypothesis, we developed different procedures to isolate Aβ species of defined size and morphology distribution (24Jan A. Hartley D.M. Lashuel H.A. Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 1186-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and we investigated their toxicity in different cell lines and primary neurons. We observed that crude Aβ42 preparations, containing a monomeric and heterogeneous mixture of Aβ42 oligomers and protofibrils, were more toxic than the purified monomeric protofibrillar fractions or fibrils. The toxicity of protofibrils was directly linked to their interactions with monomeric Aβ42 and strongly dependent on their ability to convert into amyloid fibrils. Selective removal of the monomers, by SEC or by degradation with insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), retarded the elongation of protofibrils, their fibrillization, and diminished protofibril toxicity toward cultured rat primary neurons, pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, and neuroblastoma (SHSY5Y) cells. Similarly, we show that an ongoing Aβ42 polymerization process, rather than distinct Aβ42 aggregate states, also underlies previously reported alterations in astrocyte metabolic phenotypes (25Allaman I.

After centrifugation (16,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min), the supernatant was fractionated on a Superdex 75 column as described above. The fractions eluting in the void volume were combined and labeled as protofibrils, whereas the fractions eluting under the 11–13-ml peak were combined and labeled as monomers. The PF and M fractions were further characterized by thioflavin-T (ThT) binding and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as described below and used immediately for analytical SEC and toxicity studies. Aβ CR solution was prepared and centrifuged as described above. The supernatant was injected into either a single SEC column with a higher molecular weight separation range than Superdex 75 or a combination of SEC columns connected in series (Table 1) and fractionated as described above. For experimental purposes, the fractions corresponding to monomeric elution were combined. However, the fractions corresponding to protofibrillar fractions were kept separate and labeled according to their elution position (Table 1). The fractions were further characterized by ThT binding and TEM and used immediately for analytical SEC and toxicity studies. Aβ concentration in fractions was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm (A280) using the theoretical molar extinction coefficient 1490 m−1 cm−1 (28Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). Aβ42 F were prepared by incubating the CR solution (200 μm) at 37 °C with gentle shaking for 24–48 h. Fibril formation was confirmed by ThT binding and TEM. To generate fibril seeds (SF), 100–300-nm-long fibrillar structures, the fibrils were sonicated on ice using a Vibra-CellTM instrument (Sonics and Materials, Inc.) equipped with a fine tip (five times, 20-s pulses, amplitude 40%, output watts 6, 20-s delay between successive pulses). Subsequently, the quality of SF preparation and fibril fragmentation was confirmed by TEM. Ana-SEC was carried out to assess the efficiency of fractionation and heterogeneity in each of the purified protofibrillar fractions. For this purpose, an analytical SEC column Superose 6 pc 3.2/30 was connected to a Waters Separation Module 2795 equipped with a photodiode array detector (Waters). Aliquots (50 μl) of the Aβ fractions were injected into the column and eluted at flow rate of 0.05 ml/min. Aβ elution was monitored at UV A210, A254, and A280. Primary cortical neurons were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, L'Arbresle, France) at postnatal day 1 essentially as described previously (29Meberg P.J. Miller M.W. Methods Cell Biol. 2003; 71: 111-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After removing the meninges, the cortical tissue was cut into small pieces and enzymatically disrupted in dissociation buffer (papain, CaCl2, EDTA, and HEPES; 30 min; 37 °C). The DNase was added for 10 min. Cortex pieces were then washed three times in prewarmed complete growth medium (neurobasal + 10% FCS + penicillin/streptomycin + l-glutamine; Invitrogen) and then triturated seven times in 5 ml of medium. Cells were filtered through a 0.45-μm cell strainer, counted, and plated onto 96-well, poly-l-lysine-precoated plates (30,000 cells/200 μl/well). After 90 min of incubation at 37 °C, the medium was replaced by astrocyte-conditioned growth medium. On the 4th day in vitro (DIV 4), 2.5 μm cytarabine (Sigma) was added. PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen 41966-029) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 2 μm human recombinant insulin (Invitrogen). The cells were plated in 96-well transparent BD Falcon plates (30,000 cells/200 μl/well) and allowed to grow in a cell culture incubator (37 °C; ambient humidity; 5% CO2) for 24–48 h. SHSY5Y cells (40,000 cells/100 μl/well) were cultured in a similar fashion as PC12. Primary neurons were treated with the following Aβ42 preparations: 1) Aβ42 crude; 2) Aβ42 fibrils; 3) SEC purified protofibrils and monomers; and 4) 1:1 molar mixtures of protofibrils and monomers. For this purpose, on DIV 7 half of the culture medium was replaced by complete growth medium containing Aβ preparations (0.2 (v/v) medium dilution; Aβ preparations and the buffer vehicle contained 140 mm NaCl and 10 μm final Aβ concentration). After 24 h of treatment, neuronal cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay as described below. After 24–48 h in culture, half of the culture medium was removed and replaced with the indicated Aβ preparations. For this purpose, Aβ preparations were added to the supplemented 10× DMEM (Table 2) at a 9:1 (v/v) ratio. PC12 and SHSY5Y cells were treated with final Aβ concentration of ∼10 μm. After 24 h of treatment, cell viability was assessed by MTT reduction assay. Medium aliquots were obtained for ThT binding and TEM.TABLE 2Supplemented 10× DMEM for delivery of Aβ fractions for toxicity assaysSerial no.Component (stock)VolumeConcentrationμl1.DMEM (10×, Sigma D2429)6902.l-Glutamine (200 mm)20040 mm3.Insulin (690 μm)3020.7 μm4.Glucose (5 m)40250 mmaSigma 10× DMEM already contains 10 g/liter glucose.

Open table in a new tab Mixtures of SEC-purified Aβ42 monomers, protofibrils fractions (Table 1), and sonicated fibrils were prepared in supplemented 10× DMEM (Table 2). Briefly, the following mixtures were prepared (molar ratios): 1) protofibrils and monomers (1:1); 2) protofibrils and sonicated fibrils (4:1); 3) monomers and sonicated fibrils (4:1); 4) protofibrils, monomers, and sonicated fibrils (2:2:1); and 5) protofibrils and monomers, and the monomers were incubated with insulin-degrading enzyme (R & D Systems catalog no. 2496-ZN) for 20 min at room temperature (Aβ: recombinant human IDE, 20:1) and then added to protofibrils. PC12 and SHSY5Y cells were treated with mixtures 1–5 (final Aβ concentration of ≈10 μm), and after 24 h, viability was assessed by MTT reduction assay. Medium aliquots were obtained for ThT binding and TEM. PC12 cells were cultured in phenol red-free DMEM (Invitrogen catalog no. 21063-029) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 2 μm human recombinant insulin (Invitrogen). PC12 cells were treated with 10 μm Aβ42 crude solution. Medium aliquots were obtained at selected time points and analyzed by ThT binding and TEM. In parallel, cell viability was assessed by MTT reduction and lactate dehydrogenase release in the media as described below. The viability of Aβ-treated cells was assessed by MTT reduction assay using a commercial kit (Promega, catalog no. G4000) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm (λ690 nm was used as a reference wavelength) in a Safire2 microplate reader (TECAN). The signal was expressed as percentage of the A570–690 count from the vehicle-treated cells (100%). The lactate dehydrogenase release assay was carried out on medium aliquots using a commercial kit (Sigma TOX-7) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lactate dehydrogenase content in the medium of the vehicle treated cells was expressed as 100%. Primary cortical astrocyte cultures were prepared as established previously using 1–2-day-old Swiss Albino mice (OF1, Charles River Laboratories) (25Allaman I. Gavillet M. Bélanger M. Laroche T. Viertl D. Lashuel H.A. Magistretti P.J. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3326-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). After removing the meninges, cortices were isolated and dissociated by passage through needles of decreasing gauges (1.2 × 40 mm, 0.8 × 40 mm, and 0.5 × 16 mm) using a 10-ml syringe. Cells were seeded on polyornithine-coated 35 × 10-mm culture dishes in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Sigma catalog no. D7777, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 44 mm NaHCO3, and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Invitrogen)) and incubated (37 °C; 5% CO2, 95% air). On DIV 5, the medium was renewed with fresh medium and then renewed twice a week until use. On DIV 21, cells were treated for 24 h with Aβ preparations (in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) diluted in the growth medium (0.2 (v/v) dilution), for 24 h. 2-[3H]DG utilization (uptake and phosphorylation) by Aβ-treated cells was assessed as outlined below. 2-[3H]DG utilization experiments were conducted as described previously (25Allaman I. Gavillet M. Bélanger M. Laroche T. Viertl D. Lashuel H.A. Magistretti P.J. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3326-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The media used for 2-[3H]DG uptake were pre-equilibrated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% air. To initiate the 2-[3H]DG assay, the medium was replaced by 2 ml of serum-free medium (DMEM (D5030, Sigma) supplemented with 5 mm glucose, 44 mm NaHCO3, and 1% of antibiotic/antimycotic solution) containing 1 μCi/ml 2-[3H]DG. The cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% air. The assay was terminated by aspiration of the culture medium and washing the cells three times with 4 ml of ice-cold PBS. Cells were then lysed by adding 2 ml of 10 mm NaOH containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Then 500-μl aliquots, in duplicates, were assayed for radioactivity using liquid scintillation counting. The results were calculated by subtracting from the total counts the portion that was not inhibited by the glucose transporter inhibitor cytochalasin B (25 μm), which was added 20 min prior to and along the 2-[3H]DG incubation. 2-[3H]DG utilization was calculated as femtomoles per dish and then expressed as percentage of the vehicle control. ThT binding assay was performed by mixing 80 μl of Aβ preparations (in SEC buffer or cell culture media) with 20 μl of ThT (100 μm) and 10 μl of glycine-NaOH, pH 8.5 (500 mm), in a Nunc 384-well fluorescence plate (100 μl/well). The ThT fluorescence of each sample was measured in an Analyst AD fluorometer (Molecular Devices, Switzerland) at excitation and emission wavelengths of λ450 nm and λ485 nm, respectively. A 5–10-μl droplet of sample containing Aβ (Aβ preparations or cell culture media) was deposited on a 200 mesh Formvar-coated TEM grid (EM Sciences) and was allowed to settle for ∼60 s. The excess solution was wicked away by gently applying a piece of blotting paper to the edge of the grid. Then a 10-μl droplet of 2% uranyl acetate was deposited on the grid and allowed to settle for ∼60 s. The excess solution was removed as above. Finally, the grid was vacuum-dried by gently applying the vacuum probe close to the grid edges. Image acquisition was carried out using a Phillips CM10 microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. We and others have shown that toxic Aβ protofibril preparations consist of a heterogeneous mixture of high molecular weight aggregates of various sizes and morphologies (12Lashuel H.A. Hartley D.M.

To determine whether the cytotoxicity of protofibrils is associated with specific type of aggregates or depends on the dynamics of inter-conversion among different aggregate species, we subjected a crude Aβ42 protofibril preparation (Aβ42 CR) to fractionation by SEC (12Lashuel H.A.

Protoc. 2010; 5: 1186-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Then we investigated the cellular toxicity of individual Aβ42 fractions, enriched with distinct protofibrillar aggregates, using cultured PC12 and SHSY5Y cells. Subfractionation of Aβ42 protofibrils on a Superose 6 column resulted in 4–6 fractions corresponding to the elution of protofibrils (Fig. 1A). Only the first four protofibril fractions (F1–F4) had sufficient Aβ content (≥25 μm) to be useful for toxicity experiments. The monomers eluted later in two fractions (F5 and F6) that were separate from protofibrils (Fig. 1A). Reinjection of the purified Aβ species onto an Ana-SEC column showed that only F1 and F4 exhibited distinct elution profile for the protofibril peak, suggesting marked differences in the size distribution of the aggregates in these fractions (Fig. 1B). Soon after SEC fractionation, F1 consisted of large aggregates and clusters of protofibrils (Fig. 1F), whereas F3 was predominantly enriched with short curvilinear and spherical protofibrils (Fig. 1G). The monomer fraction (F5) was devoid of any visible aggregates (Fig. 1H). Ana-SEC of the monomer fractions (F5 and F6) showed a single narrow elution peak (data not shown). Cell viability assessments of Aβ-treated cultured PC12 and SHSY5Y cells revealed that crude Aβ42 protofibrils (CR) decreased viability by ∼40–45% (p < 0.01), whereas the toxicity of Aβ42 SEC fractions (protofibrils and monomers) did not exceed ∼10–20% (Fig. 1C). Aβ40 monomers were also tested as control and consistently showed only a slight, but not significant, effect on the cell viability (∼5–10%, p > 0.05; Fig. 1C). To determine whether the observed toxicity correlated with the changes in Aβ42 aggregation state in individual fractions, we sampled the cell culture medium at different time points and probed the aggregation state of Aβ using ThT and TEM.

The RAG1/2 complex makes the double-strand breaks that initiate recombination. The ends of these breaks are hairpins that can only be cleaved by the Artemis nuclease. Barry Sleckman and colleagues show that the specificity for Artemis is dictated by the histone variant H2AX, in cooperation with the repair protein MDC1. In the absence of H2AX, another nuclease, CtIP, can open the ends but they are not joined efficiently by classical non-homogeneous end-joining, and this leads to genomic instability. Antigen receptor loci contain numerous gene segments that are recombined in response to antigen stimulation. The RAG endonuclease makes the double-strand breaks that initiate recombination. The ends of these breaks are hairpins that can only be cleaved by the Artemis nuclease. Here, it is shown that the specificity for Artemis is dictated by the histone protein H2AX, in cooperation with the repair protein MDC-1. In the absence of H2AX, another nuclease, CtIP, can open the ends but they are not joined efficiently; this leads to genomic instability. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generated by the recombination activating gene (RAG) endonuclease in all developing lymphocytes as they assemble antigen receptor genes1. DNA cleavage by RAG occurs only at the G1 phase of the cell cycle and generates two hairpin-sealed DNA (coding) ends that require nucleolytic opening before their repair by classical non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)1,2,3. Although there are several cellular nucleases that could perform this function, only the Artemis nuclease is able to do so efficiently2,3. Here, in vivo, we show that in murine cells the histone protein H2AX prevents nucleases other than Artemis from processing hairpin-sealed coding ends; in the absence of H2AX, CtIP can efficiently promote the hairpin opening and resection of DNA ends generated by RAG cleavage. This CtIP-mediated resection is inhibited by γ-H2AX and by MDC-1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1), which binds to γ-H2AX in chromatin flanking DNA DSBs. Moreover, the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase activates antagonistic pathways that modulate this resection. CtIP DNA end resection activity is normally limited to cells at post-replicative stages of the cell cycle, in which it is essential for homology-mediated repair4,5. In G1-phase lymphocytes, DNA ends that are processed by CtIP are not efficiently joined by classical NHEJ and the joints that do form frequently use micro-homologies and show significant chromosomal deletions. Thus, H2AX preserves the structural integrity of broken DNA ends in G1-phase lymphocytes, thereby preventing these DNA ends from accessing repair pathways that promote genomic instability."
https://openalex.org/W2167878233,"Mitochondrial cytochrome P450 11A1 (CYP11A1 or P450 11A1) is the only known enzyme that cleaves the side chain of cholesterol, yielding pregnenolone, the precursor of all steroid hormones. Pregnenolone is formed via three sequential monooxygenation reactions that involve the progressive production of 22R-hydroxycholesterol (22HC) and 20α,22R-dihydroxycholesterol, followed by the cleavage of the C20-C22 bond. Herein, we present the 2.5-Å crystal structure of CYP11A1 in complex with the first reaction intermediate, 22HC. The active site cavity in CYP11A1 represents a long curved tube that extends from the protein surface to the heme group, the site of catalysis. 22HC occupies two-thirds of the cavity with the 22R-hydroxyl group nearest the heme, 2.56 Å from the iron. The space at the entrance to the active site is not taken up by 22HC but filled with ordered water molecules. The network formed by these water molecules allows the “soft” recognition of the 22HC 3β-hydroxyl. Such a mode of 22HC binding suggests shuttling of the sterol intermediates between the active site entrance and the heme group during the three-step reaction. Translational freedom of 22HC and torsional motion of its aliphatic tail are supported by solution studies. The CYP11A1–22HC co-complex also provides insight into the structural basis of the strict substrate specificity and high catalytic efficiency of the enzyme and highlights conserved structural motifs involved in redox partner interactions by mitochondrial P450s.

Steroid hormones are essential for life. In vertebrates, they are all synthesized from pregnenolone, which is in turn formed from cholesterol via a three-step process catalyzed by cytochrome P450 11A1 (CYP11A1) (1Simpson E.R. Boyd G.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 2: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). During the first step, cholesterol is converted to 22R-hydroxycholesterol (22HC), 3The abbreviations used are: 22HC22R-hydroxycholesterol20,22DHC20α,22R-dihydroxycholesterolAdxadrenodoxinWatwater. the second step produces 20α,22R-dihydroxycholesterol (20,22DHC), and the third step involves the cleavage of the C20-C22 bond in 20,22DHC to yield pregnenolone (supplemental Fig. S1A) (2Burstein S. Middleditch B.S. Gut M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9028-9037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sterol intermediates do not accumulate during the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone and bind much more tightly to CYP11A1 than cholesterol, suggesting that they remain in the active site until all three oxidative steps are completed (1Simpson E.R.

All enzymatic steps take place in the inner mitochondrial membrane of steroidogenic tissues and require a total of 3 mol of O2, 3 mol of NADPH, and six electrons transferred separately from NADPH to adrenodoxin reductase, adrenodoxin (Adx), and CYP11A1 (supplemental Fig. S1B). CYP11A1 is an important enzyme whose deficiency leads to lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a lethal disease if untreated (5Pikuleva I.A. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2006; 34: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although this P450 has been the subject of extensive studies (6Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. 3rd Ed. Cytochrome P450. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2005: 377-530Google Scholar), the key amino acid residues involved in substrate recognition and catalysis have not yet been identified, and the mechanism by which CYP11A1 carries out three sequential monooxygenation reactions with the intermediates not leaving the enzyme active site remains unclear. 22R-hydroxycholesterol 20α,22R-dihydroxycholesterol adrenodoxin water. The significance of CYP11A1 extends beyond involvement in biosynthesis of steroid hormones. This hemoprotein is among the only four enzymes in vertebrates (CYP7A1, CYP27A1, CYP46A1, and CYP11A1) that initiate biotransformation of cholesterol in different organs and thus play important roles in the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis (7Pikuleva I.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 112: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cholesterol-metabolizing P450s share low amino acid sequence identity (<25%) and produce different cholesterol metabolites (5Pikuleva I.A. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2006; 34: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) yet bind cholesterol tightly and represent a unique system to study enzyme adaption to physiological requirements of different organs for cholesterol turnover rate. Previously, we determined crystal structures of ligand-free and sterol-bound CYP46A1 (8Mast N. White M.A. Bjorkhem I. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. Pikuleva I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9546-9551Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), a microsomal monooxygenase that controls cholesterol turnover in the brain (9Russell D.W. Halford R.W. Ramirez D.M. Shah R.

The crystal structure reveals specific interactions between the enzyme and the intermediate substrate 22HC and implies a unique mechanism for substrate retention underlying the three-step catalysis. Comparison with CYP46A1 reveals the diversity of cholesterol-binding modes by different cholesterol hydroxylases. Comparison with CYP24A1, the first structurally characterized mitochondrial P450 (10Annalora A.J. Goodin D.B. Hong W.X. Zhang Q. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. J. Mol.

Full-length mature bovine CYP11A1 with a His4 tag at the C terminus was expressed as described previously (11Pikuleva I.A. Mackman R.L. Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and purified using five consecutive chromatography steps on DEAE-cellulose, nickel-agarose, hydroxylapatite, Adx-Sepharose, and SP-Sepharose with 50 μm 22HC and 5 mm CHAPS present in all the buffers. During the last chromatography step, CHAPS was replaced with 2.8 mm octyl pentaethylene glycol ether (C8E5). Crystals of CYP11A1 were grown at 18 °C overnight in sitting drops after 1 μl of CYP11A1 solution was mixed with 1 μl of precipitant solution. The P450 solution contained ∼23 mg/ml CYP11A1, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 20% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% C8E5, 50 μm 22HC, and 1 mm EDTA. The precipitant solution was 14% PEG 1000, 20% glycerol, 12% JEFFAMINE ED-2001, 0.1 m MES (pH 7.0), and 10% isopropyl alcohol. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using rat mitochondrial CYP24A1 (Protein Data Bank code 3K9V) as a search model and 2.8-Å resolution data for CYP11A1 in space group P32212. The structure was refined against a 2.5-Å resolution data set for CYP11A1 in space group P21 (supplemental Table S1 and Figs. S2 and S3). Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (Protein Data Bank code 3MZS). Reduced CO difference spectra were recorded as described (12Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) under anaerobic conditions in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing an oxygen-scavenging system (60 mm glucose, 2000 units/ml catalase, and 30 units/ml glucose oxidase). The buffer was degassed and bubbled with nitrogen prior to the addition of the oxygen-scavenging system and CYP11A1. Reduced Adx was obtained by addition of an equimolar amount of sodium dithionite to oxidized protein. When reduced Adx was mixed with reduced CYP11A1, the latter was reduced prior to addition of the former by addition of an equimolar amount of sodium dithionite. The CYP11A1–22HC complex crystallized in space group P21 with four copies in the asymmetric unit (a D2 symmetric tetramer with root mean square deviation ∼0.5 Å between component monomers) (supplemental Table S1). The overall fold and details of the active site are similar in all copies, including well defined electron density for 22HC allowing unambiguous fitting of the substrate (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). Ninety-two H2O molecules were resolved, most within the active site cavity. The CYP11A1 structure displays the canonical P450 fold with two additional helices, A′ and K″, which are also present in mitochondrial P450 CYP24A1 (10Annalora A.J. Goodin D.B. Hong W.X. Zhang Q. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 396: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The active site cavity in CYP11A1 is closed and resembles a banana-shaped tunnel (Fig. 1A). 22HC occupies only two-thirds of the volume of the tunnel, with the sterol β-surface facing the distal side of the heme. The aliphatic tail of 22HC is centered over the heme iron, and the 3β-hydroxyl is directed toward the aqueous cavity. Thirty-nine residues from 14 different secondary structural elements define the active site cavity in CYP11A1. Yet only 12 amino acid residues are within 4 Å of 22HC. The aliphatic tail of 22HC makes van der Waals contacts with the side chains of Ile-351 (β1–4 strand region), Thr-291 (I helix), Phe-203 (F helix), and Met-202 (F helix). The sterol α-face is surrounded by the side chains of Ile-85 (B-B′ loop), Leu-460 (β4-1/4-2 loop), and Trp-88 (B′ helix), and the β-face is defined by Gln-356, Thr-354, Val-353, and Ser-352 (all residues are from the β1–4 strand region). In addition, Phe-458 (β4–1 strand) restrains the edge of sterol ring A. Collectively, the active site amino acid residues form a cavity whose shape is in good agreement with previous studies on CYP11A1 substrate specificity. The enzyme active site was shown to have strict requirements for the planarity of the sterol backbone, extra space beyond the 3β-hydroxyl and aliphatic tail, and limited space at carbon atoms 4–6 and 17 (13Trout Jr., E.C.

In the crystal structure, the 22R-hydroxyl is located above the heme tetrapyrrole with the Fe-O22 distance (2.56 Å) within the reported errors for a coordinate bond (23Shaik S. Kumar D. de Visser S.P. Altun A. Thiel W. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 2279-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), yet, in solution, 22HC elicits a partial type 1 spectral response in the CYP11A1 absolute spectrum and predominantly a type 1 response in the difference spectrum (Fig. 2), indicative of pentacoordinate iron with no distal coordination. This apparent discrepancy could be explained as follows. The CYP11A1–22HC complex is sampling more than one spin state population, some characterized by the distal iron coordination, whereas others are not. The population of these spin states would conform to Boltzmann statistics and is temperature-dependent. Because the x-ray and spectral data were collected at two different temperatures (100 K and ambient, respectively), the coordinated state is captured in the crystal structure, whereas at ambient temperature, the ligand is more mobile, affording the partial type 1 spectra. If this is the case, coordination of the heme iron explains a much tighter binding of 22HC relative to cholesterol and its stereoisomer 22S-hydroxycholesterol (3Orme-Johnson N.R. Light D.R. White-Stevens R.W. Orme-Johnson W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2103-2111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lambeth J.D. Kitchen S.E. Farooqui A.A. Tuckey R. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1876-1884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but does not support the existence of an active site residue that interacts with the 22R-hydroxyl by hydrogen bonding proposed by previous studies (4Lambeth J.D. Kitchen S.E. Farooqui A.A. Tuckey R. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1876-1884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are no amino acid residues or water molecules closer than 4.0 Å from the 22R-hydroxyl in the crystal structure of CYP11A1. A remarkable feature of the CYP11A1 co-complex is the nature of the interactions with the sterol 3β-hydroxyl. Although this group has no direct contacts with the protein, it forms two hydrogen bonds with crystallographically observed waters Wat-523 and Wat-526, which are hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Gln-377 and Wat-525, respectively (Fig. 1B). Gln-377 participates in an extensive hydrogen bond network with the Tyr-62 hydroxyl, Wat-549, Wat-521, Wat-522, Glu-53, and the His-40 imidazole, whereas Wat-525 interacts with the Leu-210 carbonyl and Tyr-83 hydroxyl (waters are found in similar positions in all four monomers) (supplemental Fig. S4). We propose that these water-mediated interactions with substrate are the mechanism by which CYP11A1 recognizes substrate; hence, we term it “soft” recognition. Portions of the enclosed space at the active site entrance not exhibiting ordered solvent are presumed to contain water, as they are also surrounded by polar residues. Altogether, the volume unoccupied by 22HC at the active site entrance accounts for ∼28% of the total volume of the active site cavity (625 Å3), which is sufficient to accommodate up to 15 waters at one time. The presence of the water array at the active site entrance in all four copies suggests that hydration of this part of the active site is important for CYP11A1 function. In particular, the lack of specific recognition of the 3β-hydroxyl and the presence of water-mediated interactions with the protein instead suggest that the substrate can exhibit mobility while remaining bound within the enzyme. The shape of the active site implies that substrate movement is translational such that the intermediates move toward or away from the heme. Translational freedom of the entire substrate, together with torsional changes in the aliphatic tail, could position the C20 or C22 atoms for stereospecific sequential oxidation reactions. The CYP11A1–22HC complex likely reflects sterol binding at the end of the first monooxygenation cycle (supplemental Fig. S1B). During the next cycle, CYP11A1 must be reduced by its redox partner, Adx, and the aliphatic tail of 22HC must change position so that molecular oxygen can bind to the heme iron. We propose that interaction with reduced Adx induces conformational changes in the P450 that push 22HC away from the heme iron, displacing the intermediate toward the entrance to the active site. This translational mode of movement of 22HC would create the space above the iron necessary for the binding of molecular oxygen. During subsequent electron transfer from reduced Adx and oxygen binding to the iron, 22HC would remain displaced toward the entrance of the active site. However, after formation of the reactive oxyferryl intermediate and dissociation of Adx, movement of 22HC back toward the heme could position the aliphatic tail for hydroxylation at C20. Similar motions of 20,22DHC could occur during the third monooxygenation cycle, leading to formation of pregnenolone. To test our hypothesis about sterol shuttling during the catalytic cycle, we capitalized on the ability of reduced P450s to form a complex with CO that has a characteristic absorption maximum at 450 nm (supplemental Fig. S1B) (12Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A solution containing ligand-free CYP11A1 and an oxygen-scavenging system was reduced chemically with sodium dithionite and divided into two cuvettes, and CO was bubbled through one cuvette. The recorded difference spectrum showed a peak at 450 nm (Fig. 3A, black line), indicating that reduced CYP11A1 has space near the heme iron to bind CO, as expected. When repeated with an equimolar amount of 22HC added to CYP11A1 prior to reduction and bubbling with CO, no peak at 450 nm was observed in the CO spectrum (Fig. 3A, red line). This result is consistent with the close proximity of the C22 hydroxyl group to iron (Fig. 1), leaving no space near the iron for CO to bind, and with prior studies by others showing that the Kd value for CO increases >300-fold when CYP11A1 interacts with 22HC (24Tuckey R.C. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4232-4237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A control experiment with cholesterol (10-fold molar excess over CYP11A1) added prior to sodium dithionite and bubbling with CO showed a peak at 450 nm, thus demonstrating that it is the 22R-hydroxyl that blocks CO access to the heme iron in the CYP11A1–22HC complex (Fig. 3A, dashed blue line). In the next series of experiments, CYP11A1 was reduced with Adx. The enzyme was first sequentially mixed with equimolar 22HC and a 5-fold molar excess of reduced Adx, followed by CO bubbling of one of the cuvettes. The CO spectrum was restored (Fig. 3B, green solid line) as compared with the chemically reduced CYP11A1–22HC complex (Fig. 3A, red line), indicating that binding of reduced Adx alters the position of 22HC and creates space above the iron for CO. Then 1 m NaCl was added to both cuvettes to induce dissociation of Adx from CYP11A1 (interactions of Adx with CYP11A1 are mainly electrostatic (25Lambeth J.D. Kriengsiri S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8810-8816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The peak at 450 nm decreased significantly (Fig. 3B, green dashed line) yet did not disappear completely. After correcting for dilution, the decrease in absorbance at 450 nm was 60%. Three control experiments were then carried out. The first control experiment was with addition of 1 m NaCl to the solution of CYP11A1 mixed with reduced Adx but no 22HC present. This experiment showed only a decrease in the 450 nm peak corresponding to the dilution (Fig. 3C, solid and dashed magenta lines). In the second and third control experiments, CYP11A1 in complex with 22HC was reduced with sodium dithionite, followed by addition of reduced and oxidized Adx, respectively, and CO bubbling. No peaks at 450 nm were observed (Fig. 3D, orange and green lines), indicating a lack of complex formation. However, according to the calculated Kd values of reduced and oxidized Adx for cholesterol-bound reduced CYP11A1 (250 nm and 120 nm, respectively), the formation of these complexes should occur under the experimental conditions used (26Lambeth J.D. Pember S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the affinities of reduced and oxidized Adx are different for cholesterol-bound CYP11A1 relative to 22HC-bound P450. Also, these affinities should be determined experimentally to assess the values calculated previously (26Lambeth J.D. Pember S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To summarize, by using CO as a probe for the space above the heme iron, we demonstrate that binding of Adx indeed shifts the 22HC molecule, which can then displace bound CO upon dissociation of Adx. These results provide evidence for motion of 22HC both away from and toward the heme, in support of soft recognition. Our hypothesis is in agreement with previous studies showing mutually facilitated binding of cholesterol and Adx to CYP11A1 as assessed by the absorbance changes in the Soret region (27Lambeth J.D. Seybert D.W. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 138-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and studies by electron paramagnetic resonance indicating reorientation of cholesterol in the active site of oxidized CYP11A1 upon interaction with reduced Adx (28Tsubaki M. Hiwatashi A. Ichikawa Y. Fujimoto Y. Ikekawa N. Hori H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4856-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Yet our proposed model is not consistent with a study on oxygen interaction with the reduced CYP11A1, which demonstrates that oxygen can bind to the P450 without binding of Adx (24Tuckey R.C. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4232-4237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We note, however, that the steric clash of bound CO with 22HC would be considerably more severe than for O2 because of the linear coordination of CO (Fe-C-O angle of 180°) versus the bent coordination of O2 (Fe-O-O angle of 109°). While this manuscript was in preparation, the coordinates of the 2.5-Å crystal structure of human CYP11A1 in complex with 20,22DHC (Protein Data Bank code 3NA0) were released by the Structural Genomic Consortium (University of Toronto). Superposition of this structure onto our structure of bovine CYP11A1 bound to 22HC (code 3MZS) shows a root mean square deviation of 0.95 Å for all atoms of 462 aligned residues (3872 atoms of 3NA0 and 3904 atoms of 3MZS). The Cα atom traces of the two structures are very similar, as are the positions of the substrates and substrate contact residues (supplemental Fig. S5, A–D) Similarities also extend to the shape (supplemental Fig. S5C) and volume (624 and 625 Å3 in 3NA0 and 3MZS, respectively) of the active site and the presence and position of ordered water molecules at the entrance to the active site, six waters in 3NA0 and seven waters in 3MZS (supplemental Fig. S5D). Like the 3β-hydroxyl in 22HC, the 3β-hydroxyl in 20,22DHC has no direct contacts with the protein and is hydrogen-bonded to two H2O molecules, Wat-42 and Wat-599, which are water-bridged to the side chains of His-78, Tyr-100, and Gln-416 and the Glu-91 carbonyl (supplemental Fig. S5D), analogs of His-40, Tyr-62, Gln-377, and Glu-53, which participate in the interactions with the 3β-hydroxyl in 22HC. (The two CYP11A1 structures have different numbering of amino acid residues; numbering in 3NA0 is based on the sequence of the precursor protein, whereas that in 3MZS reflects the sequence of the mature protein.) The Val-96 carbonyl also participates in the interactions with the water array in 3NA0. Its analog in 3MZS does not have water contacts; instead, the Leu-210 and Asn-211 carbonyls are involved. The 20α- and 22R-hydroxyls in 20,22DHC are at 3.3 and 3.6 Å, respectively, from the iron and, similar to 22R-hydroxyl in 22HC, are not at a hydrogen bond distance (2.8–3.2 Å) to any of the amino acid residues or waters in the active site. Close similarity of the 22HC- and 20,22DHC-bound CYP11A1 structures supports the proposed soft recognition mechanism and sterol shuttling during the three-step catalysis. The 3NA0 structure also has a 40-amino acid residue piece of Adx near the proximal side of the P450 molecule, presumably because CYP11A1 is in complex with Adx. However, discussion of these aspects must await the publication that accompanies the 3NA0 structure, as we need to know how this complex was obtained and whether it is functional, i.e. can perform cholesterol hydroxylation. Both CYP11A1 and CYP46A1 oxidize the sterol aliphatic tail. The sites of cholesterol hydroxylation by the two enzymes are different, however, as are their tissue distribution, catalytic efficiencies, degrees of substrate specificity, and cellular location (5Pikuleva I.A. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2006; 34: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Also, in CYP46A1, the hydroxylation product, 24S-hydroxycholesterol, is released from the enzyme after the monooxygenation reaction and then can re-enter the active site for further hydroxylation (29Mast N. Norcross R. Andersson U. Shou M. Nakayama K. Bjorkhem I. Pikuleva I.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14284-14292Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Structural superposition reveals that the overall shape of the active site and orientation of the substrate are similar in the two P450s, yet in CYP11A1, the active site is longer, the sterol aliphatic chain is closer to the heme, and the angle between the sterol backbone and the heme plane is more acute (Fig. 4). Three structural elements contribute to these differences. One is the B′ helix, which is rotated ∼90° in CYP11A1 (Fig. 4A). This rotation shifts the active site tunnel and consequently the 22HC backbone (Fig. 4, A and B, insets). The helix A-β1 sheet loop (residues 53–61) moves outward (up to 6 Å), leading to elongation of the active site cavity in CYP11A1 compared with CYP46A1 (Fig. 4, A and B, insets). As a result, none of the residues lining the entrance to the active site cavity can interact with the 3β-hydroxyl of 22HC, and ordered water molecules fill this extension of the active site to allow for soft recognition. In contrast, in the cholesterol 3-sulfate-CYP46A1 complex, the active site cavity conforms much more to the substrate, and the sterol carbon 3 sulfate group forms hydrogen bonds directly with protein residues (8Mast N. White M.A. Bjorkhem I. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. Pikuleva I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9546-9551Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) consistent with the single oxidation per turnover. The surplus volume in the vicinity of the aliphatic tail of CYP11A1 (Fig. 4, A and B, insets), which accommodates conformational changes during sequential hydroxylation reactions, also arises from repositioning of the B′ helix. Overall, the volumes of the active site cavities in CYP11A1 versus CYP46A1 are 625 Å3 versus 522 Å3. In CYP11A1, the K″-L loop that lies below the heme plane and contains the cysteine residue that coordinates the iron is also shifted inward by ∼2 Å together with the heme (Fig. 4, A and B), bringing the latter closer to the substrate aliphatic chain. The proximity of the aliphatic chain to the site of catalysis likely contributes to the greater efficiency of CYP11A1 (kcat/Km = 4.05 min−1 μm−1) compared with CYP46A1 (0.02 min−1 μm−1) (5Pikuleva I.A. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2006; 34: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Among P450s, CYP11A1 belongs to the separate evolutionary branch of enzymes that reside in mitochondria and catalyze highly specific reactions in the biosynthesis and degradation of hormones (30Nelson D.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Pharmacol. Toxicol. Endocrinol. 1998; 121: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The first structurally characterized mitochondrial P450 was CYP24A1 (10Annalora A.J. Goodin D.B. Hong W.X. Zhang Q. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 396: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), which performs the multistep oxidation of the side chain of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the hormonal form of vitamin D (31Omdahl J.L. Morris H.A. May B.K. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 139-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). CYP11A1 is the second mitochondrial P450 whose structure has been determined. Specificity of the enzymatic reactions, similarity of the substrates, multiple sites of sequential hydroxylation, and interactions with the same redox partner and membrane suggest conservation of tertiary structural interactions in the two mitochondrial P450s. Despite <25% of amino acid sequence identity, the root mean square deviation between CYP11A1 and CYP24A1 for 403 residue pairs based on secondary structure alignment is 2.25 Å. Superposition shows significant shifts in the position of the F and G helices, F-G loop, A′ and A helices, and N-terminal β-sheet domain, which reflect closed (substrate-bound) and open (substrate-free) conformations of the active site in CYP11A1 and CYP24A1, respectively (supplemental Fig. S6). Despite this difference, the positions of putative membrane insertion sequences involving the F-G loop and the A′ helix, identified based on computational analysis (10Annalora A.J. Goodin D.B. Hong W.X. Zhang Q. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 396: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 32Lomize M.A. Lomize A.L. Pogozheva I.D. Mosberg H.I. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar), are similar in CYP11A1 and CYP24A1 (supplemental Fig. S6 and Fig. 5A). Therefore, the orientation of P450s with respect to the membrane suggests a similar mode of substrate diffusion from within the lipid bilayer to the active site, as implied from the locations of detergent molecules in the open form of CYP24A1 (10Annalora A.J. Goodin D.B. Hong W.X. Zhang Q. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 396: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Overall, there is excellent correlation between the membrane-interacting residues in CYP11A1 identified by computational analysis (Asn-19, Trp-21, Leu-22, Tyr-25, Leu-216, Leu-219, and Phe-220) and results of site-directed mutagenesis and mass spectrometry studies (33Pikuleva I.A.

Binding of the common redox partner Adx occurs on the proximal face of the P450 molecule and is mediated by positively charged amino acid residues (36Wada A. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22877-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Pikuleva I.A. Cao C. Waterman M.R. J. Biol.

These residues are located in one or more of the three secondary structural elements: in the K helix containing the conserved (K/R)(A/G)xxKE motif, in the K″ helix containing the invariant PxRWL motif, and at the N terminus of the L helix containing the highly conserved GRRxAEx(Q/E) sequence (10Annalora A.J.

Two residues, Lys-339 and Lys-343, from the K helix motif, have been unambiguously shown to interact with Adx in CYP11A1 (36Wada A. Waterman M.R. J. Biol.

Iwamoto Y. Hiwatashi A. Ichikawa Y.

Goodin D.B. Hong W.X. Zhang Q. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 396: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These conserved basic residues and their conserved secondary structural elements are positioned similarly in CYP11A1 and CYP24A1 because of conservation of the tertiary structure interactions (Fig. 5, A and B). It is thus the conserved tertiary structure interactions that likely underlie the specificity of mitochondrial P450s for their shared redox partner, Adx. In summary, we have determined the structure of mitochondrial P450 CYP11A1 in complex with the first reaction intermediate, 22HC, of its three-step catalytic cycle. The structure reveals an enlarged active site cavity containing a cluster of ordered H2O molecules and a lack of specific contacts to the 3β-hydroxyl of cholesterol, implying mobility of the intermediates during turnover. Displacement of 22HC away from the heme, induced by Adx binding, and movement back toward the heme upon Adx release are demonstrated by difference spectroscopy in the presence of CO and are consistent with the structure. This soft mode of substrate recognition, allowing positional and conformational changes in intermediates as they remain trapped in the active site, provides a mechanistic explanation for the stereospecific sequential hydroxylation reactions catalyzed by CYP11A1. Comparative analysis of CYP11A1 with CYP46A1, which catalyzes a single hydroxylation of cholesterol, reveals how repositioning of two elements of the P450 fold, the B′ helix and helix A-β1 sheet loop region, enlarges the active site tunnel and allows for capture of up to 15 H2O molecules that surround the 22HC 3β-hydroxyl group. Comparison with CYP24A1 illustrates the mechanism of closure of the active site channel upon binding substrate and establishes common features for mitochondrial P450 membrane insertion and redox partner interaction. Together, these results provide important mechanistic insight into the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, a process of fundamental biological and medical significance. We thank C.

CTD-binding partners influence the initiation, elongation, and termination of transcription as well as a myriad of co-transcriptional processes (2Phatnani H.P. Greenleaf A.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2922-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The recruitment of these activities is tied to the progress of the polymerase by cyclic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the CTD repeats. For example, phosphorylation at the Ser5 position (Ser(P)5) predominates at the 5′-end of genes, attracting CTD-binding partners that influence initiation complex formation, mRNA capping, and the transition into elongation (3Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 541-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). As the polymerase moves toward the 3′-end of genes, the level of Ser(P)5 declines, whereas phosphorylation at Ser2 (Ser(P)2) increases, recruiting nuclear factors responsible for elongation, termination, and 3′-end formation (3Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 541-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The variable phosphorylation patterns within each heptad repeat, and distributions of these patterns across the full domain create a “CTD code” with a staggering potential complexity (4Buratowski S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). C-terminal domain phosphorylated CTD RNA polymerase II low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase small nuclear RNA. In addition to phosphorylation, proline isomerization provides a second mechanism for regulating the association of CTD-binding partners (5Shaw P.E. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Due to its cyclic side chain, proline can adopt both cis and trans conformations about its peptide bond, creating distinct and interconvertible backbone structures with the cis isomer being energetically disfavored and therefore less populated (6Lu K.P. Finn G. Lee T.H. Nicholson L.K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Each CTD heptad contains 2 proline residues, and both are preceded by serine residues that are critical targets of phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Ser-Pro motifs in non-CTD peptides has been shown to modestly stabilize the cis form and decrease the rate of isomerization (7Schutkowski M. Bernhardt A. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Reimer U. Rahfeld J.U. Lu K.P. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5566-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A study with a Ser(P)2 CTD peptide reported a cis population of <30% for the Ser(P)2–Pro3 motif with very slow interconversion of cis and trans isomers, on the order of s−1 (8Noble C.G. Hollingworth D. Martin S.R. Ennis-Adeniran V. Smerdon S.J. Kelly G. Taylor I.A. Ramos A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Relative to the short timescale of transcriptional events, this slow intrinsic exchange presents two structurally distinct and kinetically isolated binding epitopes for each proline residue in the CTD, adding an additional layer of complexity to the CTD code (4Buratowski S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The biological importance of CTD proline isomerization is unclear, but hints have been provided by studies of the yeast peptidyl prolyl isomerase Ess1 (Pin1 in humans). Peptidyl prolyl isomerases speed the interconversion of proline isomers by several orders of magnitude to restore cis-trans equilibria at a biologically relevant timescale (6Lu K.P. Finn G. Lee T.H. Nicholson L.K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Regulation of the proline “conformational switch” has been proposed to give these enzymes control over the duration and amplitude of a variety of cellular processes (6Lu K.P. Finn G. Lee T.H. Nicholson L.K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Ess1/Pin1 specifically targets phosphorylated Ser-Pro motifs and influences transcription by RNA polymerase II, likely by regulating the phosphorylation state of the CTD (9Xu Y.X. Manley J.L. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 432-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ess1/Pin1 acts on pCTD peptides in vitro, preferentially binding to the Ser(P)5–Pro6 site over the Ser(P)2–Pro3 site (10Gemmill T.R. Wu X. Hanes S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15510-15517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Numerous genetic links between Ess1 and CTD kinases and phosphatases have been reported (5Shaw P.E. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and abnormal levels of Pin1 activity cause the accumulation of aberrantly phosphorylated forms of the CTD (12Xu Y.X. Hirose Y. Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This latter phenotype may be due in part to the influence of Pin1 on the activity of Ser(P)5 CTD phosphatase Fcp1 (12Xu Y.X. Hirose Y. Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13Palancade B. Marshall N.F. Tremeau-Bravard A. Bensaude O. Dahmus M.E. Dubois M.F. J. Mol.

Despite these intriguing findings, there is no detailed understanding of how catalyzed proline isomerization modulates the CTD phosphorylation state. One of the enzymes linked to Ess1 activity is Ssu72, a CTD phosphatase with specificity for the Ser(P)5 position (15Krishnamurthy S. He X. Reyes-Reyes M. Moore C. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Despite its distinct substrate, Ssu72 shares many characteristics of the low molecular weight subfamily of protein tyrosine phosphatases (LMW PTPs) including the signature catalytic motif (CX5R) and a similar predicted arrangement of secondary structure elements (16Ganem C. Devaux F. Torchet C. Jacq C. Quevillon-Cheruel S. Labesse G. Facca C. Faye G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1588-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Meinhart A. Silberzahn T. Cramer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15917-15921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Biologically, Ssu72 influences all three stages of transcription. Ssu72 interacts genetically and physically with initiation factor TFIIB (18Sun Z.W. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1557-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Wu W.H. Pinto I. Chen B.S. Hampsey M. Genetics. 1999; 153: 643-652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been implicated in gene looping, a proposed mechanism for transcription reinitiation that tethers the promoter and terminator regions of a gene (20Singh B.N. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 806-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Ansari A. Hampsey M.

Genet. 2004; 36: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). During elongation, impaired Ssu72 activity leads to increased RNAPII pausing (23Reyes-Reyes M. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 926-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Finally, Ssu72 is a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor complex through its association with Pta1 and is essential for the proper termination of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) transcripts (16Ganem C. Devaux F. Torchet C. Jacq C. Quevillon-Cheruel S. Labesse G. Facca C. Faye G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1588-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Steinmetz E.J. Brow D.A. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2003; 278: 33000-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recently, two studies illuminated an in vivo connection between Ess1 and Ssu72 (28Singh N. Ma Z. Gemmill T. Wu X. Defiglio H. Rossettini A. Rabeler C. Beane O. Morse R.H. Palumbo M.J. Hanes S.D. Mol.

Biol. 2009; 29: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Impairing Ess1 catalytic activity in yeast cells resulted in a temperature-sensitive phenotype and the accumulation of Ser(P)5 CTD. Both defects were ameliorated by overexpression of Ssu72 (29Krishnamurthy S. Ghazy M.A. Moore C. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A genome-wide analysis of mRNA expression in these cells showed readthrough transcription for a set of genes, mainly snRNAs, with marked similarity to those previously identified in cells with impaired Ssu72 activity (28Singh N. Ma Z. Gemmill T. Wu X. Defiglio H. Rossettini A. Rabeler C. Beane O. Morse R.H. Palumbo M.J. Hanes S.D. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The prevailing model explains these results in the following way (28Singh N. Ma Z. Gemmill T. Wu X. Defiglio H. Rossettini A. Rabeler C. Beane O. Morse R.H. Palumbo M.J. Hanes S.D. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Krishnamurthy S. Ghazy M.A. Moore C. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at the Ser5 position would cause the CTD to adopt predominantly the cis form of the Ser(P)5–Pro6 motif. Near the end of snRNA transcripts, dephosphorylation of Ser(P)5 would coordinate the exchange of Nrd1 and Pcf11, two factors involved in Nrd1-dependent transcription termination. However, Ssu72 would have isomeric specificity for the less populated trans form of the Ser(P)5–Pro6 motif and would require Ess1 activity to efficiently process the entire pool of available substrate. Consequently, reduced catalysis by Ess1 would lead to an increased level of Ser(P)5 CTD, causing an improper localization of Ser(P)5 CTD-bound Nrd1 and a concomitant blocking of Ser(P)2 CTD-mediated Pcf11 recruitment and resulting in readthrough transcription. This model is supported by the fact that all reported enzymes that target Ser(P)-Pro motifs with isomeric specificity recognize the trans configuration. On the other hand, there is no evidence that the cis-Ser(P)5–Pro6 isomer of the CTD becomes the major population upon phosphorylation (7Schutkowski M. Bernhardt A. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Reimer U. Rahfeld J.U. Lu K.P. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5566-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 8Noble C.G. Hollingworth D. Martin S.R. Ennis-Adeniran V. Smerdon S.J. Kelly G. Taylor I.A. Ramos A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of proline isomer-based regulation of CTD phosphorylation states, we determined the structure of Ssu72 in complex with its Ser(P)5 CTD substrate. The structure reveals an enzyme fold that contains the conserved LMW PTP scaffold and unique additions and a surprising substrate conformation with the Ser(P)5–Pro6 motif of the CTD adopting the cis configuration. We show that the cis isomer is a minor population of substrate in solution and that Ess1 significantly enhances Ssu72 activity by catalyzing rate-limiting cis-trans interconversion. Together, this work presents structural and kinetic evidence for a unique cis-proline-specific enzymatic activity and a fascinating explanation for the in vivo relationship of Ess1 and Ssu72, with broad implications for the regulation of the CTD code and its role in coordinating co-transcriptional events. The full-length WT Drosophila melanogaster Ssu72 gene was PCR-amplified from cDNA (Open Biosystems, clone ID: RE29729), digested, and ligated into a pET15b vector (EMD Biosciences, Inc.) between the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. Point mutants of Ssu72 and Ess1 were prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The correct sequences for all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Protein expression and purification procedures are described in the supplemental material. Isotopically enriched proteins for NMR studies were overexpressed in M9 minimal media with [15N]NH4Cl and [13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. NMR experiments were conducted at 30 °C using Varian INOVA 600- or 800-MHz spectrometers. Backbone resonances for C13D/D144N D. melanogaster Ssu72 (dSsu72) were assigned using a 2H/13C/15N-labeled sample with standard three-dimensional triple-resonance experiments. The Ssu72-pCTD complex was prepared by incubating a 5:1 molar ratio of pCTD peptide (4.17 mm) to C13D/D144N dSsu72 (0.83 mm) for 30 min on ice. The complex was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion; 1 μl of protein sample was mixed with 1 μl of 22% (w/v) PEG monomethyl ether 550, 100 mm imidazole, pH 6.5, and 150 mm dl-malic acid and suspended over a reservoir of the same solution. Equilibration at 4 °C for ∼5 days produced 50 × 50 × 200-μm rhombic-shaped crystals, which were cryoprotected by dipping into a solution of mother liquor with 25% ethylene glycol before flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen. Methods for data collection, phasing, and model refinement are provided in the supplemental material. Reactions with synthetic pCTD substrate (see Fig. 4, A–D) were followed by measuring phosphate release with a standard Malachite Green reagent (30Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). For experiments with WT Ess1, 350 μl-reactions were set up in 50 mm HEPES, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT buffer at pH 6.5 (kinetics buffer) with 60 μm pCTD peptide and varying amounts of Ess1. After incubating for 10–15 min, each reaction was started by the addition of 4 μm WT dSsu72 (or 20 μm for the faster timescale reactions in supplemental Fig. S3). 50-μl aliquots were taken each minute and mixed with 50 μl of Malachite Green reagent in a 96-well plate, which was placed in the dark for 30 min to allow for color development. Color was quantified by measuring A630 nm with a SpectraMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Absorbance values were converted to phosphate content using a standard curve made with NaxPO4 solutions of known concentrations. The same protocol was followed for experiments with Ess1 mutants, with reactions containing 1 μm of each mutant. Preparation and characterization of the substrate peptide are described in the supplemental material, along with a description of kinetic assays with full-length pCTD substrate (see Fig. 4, E and F). Previous kinetic experiments suggest that Ssu72 shares the catalytic mechanism of protein tyrosine phosphatases (17Meinhart A. Silberzahn T. Cramer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15917-15921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Zhang Z.Y. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 171-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a two-step reaction that requires: 1) the CX5R catalytic motif with the cysteine side chain as a negatively charged thiolate group and 2) an aspartate residue on a flexible loop positioned near the active site (“the aspartate loop”). In the first step, the thiolate of the catalytic cysteine attacks the substrate phosphorous atom to generate a phosphoenzyme intermediate, and in the second step, the aspartate protonates the leaving phosphate to regenerate the enzyme. By screening orthologs, we identified dSsu72 as a highly stable and soluble enzyme with significant sequence similarity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ssu72 (Fig. 1A). Mutation of both the catalytic cysteine (C13D) and the catalytic aspartate (D144N) fully abolished the activity of dSsu72, and an NMR titration of 15N-labeled C13D/D144N dSsu72 with Ser(P)5 CTD peptide revealed tight binding (slow exchange on the NMR timescale) and significant perturbations of residues near the active site loop and the aspartate loop (supplemental Fig. S1). To obtain a high resolution model of the Ssu72-pCTD interaction, we used x-ray crystallography to determine the structure of C13D/D144N dSsu72 in complex with a synthetic, 7-residue Ser(P)5 CTD peptide containing the minimal binding epitope (32Hausmann S. Koiwa H. Krishnamurthy S. Hampsey M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37681-37688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with an additional residue at each end (Ac-PTpSPSYS-NH2, where the pS indicates Ser(P)). Phasing was carried out by molecular replacement using the apoWT dSsu72 structure deposited by the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 3FDF), 3A. P. Kuzin, Y.

Open table in a new tab The Ssu72 structure contains the LMW PTP fold and two sizable additions (Fig. 1, A–C, PDB code 3P9Y). The conserved scaffold consists of a central, four-stranded, parallel β-sheet flanked by two α-helices on one side and a third α-helix on the other and is represented in Fig. 1 by the structure of the LMW PTP Lpt1 in complex with its substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (33Wang S. Tabernero L. Zhang M. Harms E. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1903-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The first addition to the Ssu72 fold is an ∼60-residue insertion after the second β-strand that forms a subdomain of two β-strands packed against three α-helices. This insert structure sits immediately adjacent to the active site loop and contributes to substrate binding (see below). The corresponding region in the LMW PTP fold contains ∼25 residues and forms a single α-helix that packs against the back of the central β-sheet and is tethered by long loops that interact with substrate. The second addition is an ∼30-residue C-terminal extension that forms a helix-turn-strand motif with the β-strand bonding in an anti-parallel fashion to the central β-sheet. Another distinguishing characteristic of Ssu72 is the length of its aspartate loop. The α-helix following the aspartate loop is one turn shorter in Ssu72, which allows a commensurate shortening of the aspartate loop and increases active site accessibility from the side opposite the insert subdomain. The active site architecture of Ssu72 is very similar to LMW PTPs, providing structural support for a common mechanism of dephosphorylation. Fig. 1, D and E, show a close-up view of phosphate binding for the Ssu72-pCTD complex and the LMW PTP Lpt1-p-nitrophenyl phosphate complex (33Wang S. Tabernero L. Zhang M. Harms E. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1903-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The conformations of active site loops in these structures are nearly identical, with the backbone amide groups forming a series of hydrogen bonds to the substrate phosphate group and the guanidinium group of the catalytic arginine extending this hydrogen bonding to form a complete circle. Despite the different length of aspartate loops, the positions of the catalytic aspartate side chains (D144N in the Ssu72 structure) are very similar. Although the carboxylate of the Lpt1 aspartate is turned away from the active site, presumably due to electrostatic repulsion with the substrate phosphate group, in the Ssu72 structure, the catalytic D144N side chain is pointed toward the phosphate. Another difference between the active sites is the position of the substrate phosphate. In the Lpt1 structure, the catalytic cysteine is mutated to alanine, and this loss of negative charge allows the phosphate to bind deeper in the active site, close to the position predicted for the phosphoenzyme intermediate (33Wang S. Tabernero L. Zhang M. Harms E. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1903-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas the phosphate group in the Ssu72 structure is held ∼0.7 Å higher by the negative charge of the C13D side chain. The electron density for the pCTD peptide is excellent and extends almost completely through both termini (Fig. 2A). While the substrate phosphate group is anchored in the active site with strong hydrogen bonds, the insert subdomain creates a deep and narrow recognition cleft that forces the C-terminal end of the CTD to extend away immediately from the phosphate in a nearly opposite direction. This constrained conformation is made possible by a cis isomer of the Ser(P)5–Pro6 peptide bond (ω = −2.42°) that provides an abrupt turn in the substrate backbone. The uniqueness of the cis-Ser(P)5–Pro6 isomer and its pronounced effect on the substrate conformation are readily apparent by comparison with the structure of Ser(P)5 CTD bound to the CTD phosphatase Scp1 (PDB code 2GHT) in Fig. 2, C and D (34Zhang Y. Kim Y. Genoud N. Gao J. Kelly J.W. Pfaff S.L. Gill G.N. Dixon J.E. Noel J.P. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the Scp1 complex, the trans isomer of the Ser(P)5–Pro6 bond provides an extended backbone configuration, in contrast to the sharp kink produced by the cis-Ser(P)5–Pro6 isomer. To achieve its unusual isomeric specificity, Ssu72 must stabilize the high energy cis-proline substrate conformation (Fig. 2B). This is accomplished in part by facilitating the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the substrate Thr4 side-chain hydroxyl and the Pro6 backbone carbonyl. The Thr4 side chain is positioned by its methyl group binding in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of Lys44, Pro46, and Pro53 and the backbone of Leu45. Hydrogen bonding with the Thr4 hydroxyl forces the Pro6 residue to adopt the cis isomer, which is further stabilized by strong van der Waal interactions between the Pro6 ring and a hydrophobic patch of Ssu72 formed by the side chains of Pro46, Leu82, and Met85 and the backbone of Asn145. Between the Thr4 and Pro6 residues, the Ser(P)5 backbone amide forms a hydrogen bond with the Lys44 backbone carbonyl of Ssu72, while the Ser(P)5 side chain sits in the active site as described above. At the N-terminal end of the substrate peptide, the Pro3 residue makes minor van der Waal contacts with the Lys44 side chain of Ssu72. Toward the C-terminal end, additional isomer-specific binding energy is provided by an intermolecular hydrogen bond between the substrate Ser7 main-chain amide group and the Asn144 backbone carbonyl. While the side chains of the Ser7 and Ser2 residues are largely solvent-exposed, the phenol ring of the intervening Tyr1 side chain forms an aromatic-amide stacking interaction with the Ala49–Phe50 peptide bond of Ssu72 (35Tóth G. Watts C.R. Murphy R.F. Lovas S. Proteins. 2001; 43: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), causing a reorientation of the loop between the two β-strands of the insert subdomain in the complex when compared with the apo structure (supplemental Fig. S2). A previous study of peptides with Ser(P)-Pro motifs showed that the cis isomer is less favored than the trans form, with populations of 12–20% depending on the adjacent residues (7Schutkowski M. Bernhardt A. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Reimer U. Rahfeld J.U. Lu K.P. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5566-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Similar work with a Ser(P)2 CTD peptide reported a cis population under 30% for the Ser(P)2–Pro3 isomer (8Noble C.G. Hollingworth D. Martin S.R. Ennis-Adeniran V. Smerdon S.J. Kelly G. Taylor I.A. Ramos A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although these results suggest that phosphorylation of the Ser5–Pro6 CTD motif is unlikely to change the minority status of the cis isomer, no direct measurements have been reported. To address this point, we measured the fractions of cis- and trans-Ser(P)5–Pro6 in our substrate, a synthetic peptide with the sequence Ac-PTpSPSYS-NH2 (where the pS indicates Ser(P)), which is the same peptide used for crystallization. A natural abundance 13C-heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectrum shows two sets of signals for each proline Cβ and Cγ atom, corresponding to the cis and trans forms (Fig. 3A). However, the substrate peptide contains 2 prolines, making it difficult to unambiguously assign peaks to the Pro3 and Pro6 residues. By collecting the same experiment with a shorter peptide containing only the Pro6 residue (Fig. 3B), we were able to assign the Pro6 resonances and readily map them to the longer peptide. Populations were calculated using the average ratio of cis and trans peak volumes for the Pro6 Cβ and Cγ atoms. This gave a fractional population of 12.4% for the cis isomer, verifying that the Ser(P)5–Pro6 motif is predominantly in the trans configuration. Given that Ssu72 recognizes the minor population of cis-Ser(P)5–Pro6 isomers, the extremely slow interconversion of cis-trans-proline (s−1) may present a rate-limiting step for dephosphorylation. To test this possibility, we examined the effect of catalyzed proline isome"

We show here that D-Asp is a novel endogenous neurotransmitter in two distantly related animals’ a mammal (Rattus norvégiens) and a mollusk (Loligo vulgaris). Our main findings demonstrate that D-Asp is present in high concentrations in the synaptic vesicles of axon terminals;synthesis for this amino acid occurs in neurons by conversion of L-Asp to D-Asp via D-aspartate racemase;depolarization of nerve endings with K+ ions evokes an immediate release of D-Asp in a Ca2+ dependent manner;specific receptors for D-Asp occur at the postsynaptic membrane’ as demonstrated by binding assays and by the expansion of squid skin chromatophores;D-aspartate oxidase’ the specific enzyme that oxidizes D-Asp’ is present in the postsynaptic membranes;and stimulation of nerve endings with D-Asp triggers signal transduction by increasing the second messenger cAMP. Taken together’ these data demonstrate that D-Asp fulfills all criteria necessary to be considered a novel endogenous neurotransmitter. Given its known role inneurogenesis’ learning’ and neuropathologies’ our results have important implications for biomedical and clinical research.—D'Aniello, S., Somorjai, I., Garcia-Fernàndez, J., Topo, E., D'Aniello, A.

https://openalex.org/W2090446604,"The PI3K/Akt pathway is activated in stimulated cells and in many cancers to promote glucose metabolism and prevent cell death. Although inhibition of Akt-mediated cell survival may provide a means to eliminate cancer cells, this survival pathway remains incompletely understood. In particular, unlike anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins that prevent apoptosis independent of glucose, Akt requires glucose metabolism to inhibit cell death. This glucose dependence may occur in part through metabolic regulation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Here, we show that activated Akt relies on glycolysis to inhibit induction of Puma, which was uniquely sensitive to metabolic status among pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and was rapidly up-regulated in glucose-deficient conditions. Importantly, preventing Puma expression was critical for Akt-mediated cell survival, as Puma deficiency protected cells from glucose deprivation and Akt could not readily block Puma-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bim was induced normally even when constitutively active Akt was expressed, yet Akt could provide protection from Bim cytotoxicity. Up-regulation of Puma appeared mediated by decreased availability of mitochondrial metabolites rather than glycolysis itself, as alternative mitochondrial fuels could suppress Puma induction and apoptosis upon glucose deprivation. Metabolic regulation of Puma was mediated through combined p53-dependent transcriptional induction and control of Puma protein stability, with Puma degraded in nutrient-replete conditions and long lived in nutrient deficiency. Together, these data identify a key role for Bcl-2 family proteins in Akt-mediated cell survival that may be critical in normal immunity and in cancer through Akt-dependent stimulation of glycolysis to suppress Puma expression."
https://openalex.org/W2033191551,"Arenavirus RNA genomes are initiated by a ""prime and realign"" mechanism, such that the initiating GTP is found as a single unpaired (overhanging) nucleotide when the complementary genome ends anneal to form double-stranded (ds) RNA panhandle structures. dsRNAs modeled on these structures do not induce interferon (IFN), as opposed to blunt-ended (5' ppp)dsRNA. This study examines whether these viral structures can also act as decoys, by trapping RIG-I in inactive dsRNA complexes. We examined the ability of various dsRNAs to activate the RIG-I ATPase (presumably a measure of helicase translocation on dsRNA) relative to their ability to induce IFN. We found that there is no simple relationship between these two properties, as if RIG-I can translocate on short dsRNAs without inducing IFN. Moreover, we found that (5' ppp)dsRNAs with a single unpaired 5' ppp-nucleotide can in fact competitively inhibit the ability of blunt-ended (5' ppp)dsRNAs to induce IFN when co-transfected into cells and that this inhibition is strongly dependent on the presence of the 5' ppp. In contrast, (5' ppp)dsRNAs with a single unpaired 5' ppp-nucleotide does not inhibit poly(I-C)-induced IFN activation, which is independent of the presence of a 5' ppp group."
https://openalex.org/W2152561282,"Stargardt disease, also known as juvenile macular degeneration, occurs in approximately one in 10,000 people and results from genetic defects in the ABCA4 gene. The disease is characterized by premature accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of the eye and by vision loss. No cure or treatment is available. Although lipofuscin is considered a hallmark of Stargardt disease, its mechanism of formation and its role in disease pathogenesis are poorly understood. In this work we investigated the effects of long-term administration of deuterium-enriched vitamin A, C20-D(3)-vitamin A, on RPE lipofuscin deposition and eye function in a mouse model of Stargardt's disease. Results support the notion that lipofuscin forms partly as a result of the aberrant reactivity of vitamin A through the formation of vitamin A dimers, provide evidence that preventing vitamin A dimerization may slow disease related, retinal physiological changes and perhaps vision loss and suggest that administration of C20-D(3)-vitamin A may be a potential clinical strategy to ameliorate clinical symptoms resulting from ABCA4 genetic defects."
https://openalex.org/W1989946896,"We have recently described that in an experimental model of atherosclerosis and in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) statins increased the activation of the Smad pathway by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), leading to an increase in TGF-β-dependent matrix accumulation and plaque stabilization. Angiotensin II (AngII) activates the Smad pathway and contributes to vascular fibrosis, although the in vivo contribution of TGF-β has not been completely elucidated. Our aim was to further investigate the mechanisms involved in AngII-induced Smad activation in the vasculature, and to clarify the beneficial effects of statins on AngII-induced vascular fibrosis. Infusion of AngII into rats for 3 days activates the Smad pathway and increases fibrotic-related factors, independently of TGF-β, in rat aorta. Treatment with atorvastatin or simvastatin inhibited AngII-induced Smad activation and related-fibrosis. In cultured rat VSMCs, direct AngII/Smad pathway activation was mediated by p38 MAPK and ROCK activation. Preincubation of VSMCs with statins inhibited AngII-induced Smad activation at all time points studied (from 20 minutes to 24 hours). All these data show that statins inhibited several AngII-activated intracellular signaling systems, including p38-MAPK and ROCK, which regulates the AngII/Smad pathway and related profibrotic factors and matrix proteins, independently of TGF-β responses. The inhibitory effect of statins on the AngII/Smad pathway could explain, at least in part, their beneficial effects on hypertension-induced vascular damage."
https://openalex.org/W2003255668,"Darier's disease (DD) is an inherited autosomal-dominant skin disorder characterized histologically by loss of adhesion between keratinocytes. DD is typically caused by mutations in sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase isoform 2 (SERCA2), a major regulator of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in the skin. However, a defined role for SERCA2 in regulating intercellular adhesion remains poorly understood. We found that diminution of SERCA2 function by pharmacological inhibition or siRNA silencing in multiple human epidermal-derived cell lines was sufficient to disrupt desmosome assembly and weaken intercellular adhesive strength. Specifically, SERCA2-deficient cells exhibited up to a 60% reduction in border translocation of desmoplakin (DP), the desmosomal cytolinker protein necessary for intermediate filament (IF) anchorage to sites of robust cell-cell adhesion. In addition, loss of SERCA2 impaired the membrane translocation of protein kinase C α (PKCα), a known regulator of DP-IF association and desmosome assembly, to the plasma membrane by up to 70%. Exogenous activation of PKCα in SERCA2-deficient cells was sufficient to rescue the defective DP localization, desmosome assembly, and intercellular adhesive strength to levels comparable to controls. Our findings indicate that SERCA2-deficiency is sufficient to impede desmosome assembly and weaken intercellular adhesive strength via a PKCα-dependent mechanism, implicating SERCA2 as a novel regulator of PKCα signaling.—Hobbs, R.

We have previously reported that expression of a panel of serine proteinase kallikreins (KLK 5, 7, 8, and 10) is correlated with formation of more aggressive OSCC tumors in a murine orthotopic OSCC model and is elevated in human OSCC. Current studies focus on understanding the potential role of KLK5 in OSCC progression. In initial studies, KLK levels in malignant OSCC cells (SCC25) were compared with cells from normal oral mucosa (OKF/6) and pre-malignant oral keratinocytes (pp126) using qPCR. A marked elevation of all KLKs was observed in aggressive SCC25 cells relative to OKF/6 cells. In normal skin, KLKs are involved in desquamation during epidermal differentiation via proteolytic cleavage of the desmosomal cadherin component desmoglein 1 (Dsg1). As loss of cell-cell cohesion is prevalent in tumor metastasis, Dsg1 integrity was evaluated. Results show that SCC25 cells exhibit cleavage of Dsg1, which is blocked by proteinase inhibitor treatment as well as by siRNA silencing of KLK5 expression. Furthermore, cell-cell aggregation assays demonstrate that silencing of KLK5 enforces cell-cell adhesion; conversely, overexpression of KLK5 in normal oral mucosal cells (OKF/6) enhances cell dispersal. These data suggest that KLK5 may promote metastatic dissemination of OSCC by promoting loss of junctional integrity through cleavage of desmoglein 1."
https://openalex.org/W2070887305,"The ends of both double-strand breaks (DSBs) and telomeres undergo tightly regulated 5' to 3' resection. Resection of DNA ends, which is specifically inhibited during the G1 cell cycle phase, requires the MRX complex, Sae2, Sgs1 and Exo1. Moreover, it is negatively regulated by the non-homologous end-joining component Yku and the telomeric protein Rif2. Here, we investigate the nuclease activities that are inhibited at DNA ends by Rif2 and Yku in G1 versus G2 by using an inducible short telomere assay. We show that, in the absence of the protective function of Rif2, resection in G1 depends primarily on MRX nuclease activity and Sae2, whereas Exo1 and Sgs1 bypass the requirement of MRX nuclease activity only if Yku is absent. In contrast, Yku-mediated inhibition is relieved in G2, where resection depends on Mre11 nuclease activity, Exo1 and, to a minor extent, Sgs1. Furthermore, Exo1 compensates for a defective MRX nuclease activity more efficiently in the absence than in the presence of Rif2, suggesting that Rif2 inhibits not only MRX but also Exo1. Notably, the presence of MRX, but not its nuclease activity, is required and sufficient to override Yku-mediated inhibition of Exo1 in G2, whereas it is required but not sufficient in G1. Finally, the integrity of MRX is also necessary to promote Exo1- and Sgs1-dependent resection, possibly by facilitating Exo1 and Sgs1 recruitment to DNA ends. Thus, resection of DNA ends that are protected by Yku and Rif2 involves multiple functions of the MRX complex that do not necessarily require its nuclease activity."
https://openalex.org/W2048704715,"Ovalbumin (OVA), a non-inhibitory member of the serpin superfamily, forms fibrillar aggregates upon heat-induced denaturation. Recent studies suggested that OVA fibrils are generated by a mechanism similar to that of amyloid fibril formation, which is distinct from polymerization mechanisms proposed for other serpins. In this study, we provide new insights into the mechanism of OVA fibril formation through identification of amyloidogenic core regions using synthetic peptide fragments, site-directed mutagenesis, and limited proteolysis. OVA possesses a single disulfide bond between Cys73 and Cys120 in the N-terminal helical region of the protein. Heat treatment of disulfide-reduced OVA resulted in the formation of long straight fibrils that are distinct from the semiflexible fibrils formed from OVA with an intact disulfide. Computer predictions suggest that helix B (hB) of the N-terminal region, strand 3A, and strands 4–5B are highly β-aggregation-prone regions. These predictions were confirmed by the fact that synthetic peptides corresponding to these regions formed amyloid fibrils. Site-directed mutagenesis of OVA indicated that V41A substitution in hB interfered with the formation of fibrils. Co-incubation of a soluble peptide fragment of hB with the disulfide-intact full-length OVA consistently promoted formation of long straight fibrils. In addition, the N-terminal helical region of the heat-induced fibril of OVA was protected from limited proteolysis.

However, amyloid fibril formation of OVA has not been definitively confirmed because x-ray fiber diffraction did not validate the cross-β-structure, and the kinetics of fibril formation of OVA is non-nucleation-dependent (23Tani F. Shirai N. Onishi T. Venelle F. Yasumoto K. Doi E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The partial loop-inserted model has previously been proposed to explain the formation of a thermostabilized form of OVA (S-OVA) from native conformation under elevated pH conditions (15Huntington J.A.

Although this model was subsequently excluded by analyzing the crystal structure of S-OVA (34Yamasaki M. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol.

Therefore, OVA also possesses a metastable conformation like other serpins, and the intermolecular partial loop insertion model has not been completely ruled out as the mechanism for heat-induced fibril formation (37Shirai N. Tani F. Higasa T. Yasumoto K. J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 787-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the heat-induced OVA fibril is formed by a unique mechanism. Indeed, this phenomenon constitutes an intriguing model to study the aggregation mechanism of serpins. Here, we provide new insights into the mechanism of heat-induced aggregation of OVA by identifying the core regions for the formation of fibrillar aggregates. Amyloidogenic proteins contain local regions with high β-aggregation (aggregation with β-sheet conformation) propensity, which act as a core for the formation of amyloid fibrils (38Chiti F. Taddei N.

Katou H. Hagihara Y. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, this method is limited to proteins whose three-dimensional structure in solution can be solved by NMR and, therefore, not suitable for OVA, which has a higher molecular weight than β2m and whose NMR solution structure is unsolved. To identify the core regions for the heat-induced fibril of OVA, we carried out a systematic mapping of the core regions using synthetic peptide fragments, site-directed mutagenesis, and limited proteolysis. In the heat-denatured states of OVA, thiol-disulfide exchanges between the single disulfide bond Cys73 and Cys120 and the other four free cysteines proceed extensively (23Tani F. Shirai N. Onishi T. Venelle F. Yasumoto K. Doi E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To avoid the thiol-disulfide exchanges and simplify analysis of the results, fibril formation of OVA was performed under disulfide-reduced conditions. The conformational property of disulfide-reduced OVA (SH-OVA) has been reported to be similar to that of intact OVA except that the heat transition temperature was 6.8 °C lower and the N-terminal helical region of SH-OVA is more flexible than that of intact OVA (40Takahashi N. Koseki T. Doi E. Hirose M. J Biochem. 1991; 109: 846-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). By identifying the core regions for heat-induced aggregation of SH-OVA, we discuss the molecular mechanism for the fibril formation of OVA in the light of the aggregation of serpins. OVA (S-OVA free) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with 20 mm NaCl was used as solvent. The disulfide-reduced OVA (SH-OVA) was prepared by incubation of intact OVA in 15 mm DTT at 37 °C for 2 h. All peptides used in this study were synthesized and purified by Genescript (Piscataway, NJ). The purities of the peptides were >95% according to HPLC and mass spectroscopy. Wild-type and mutant OVA were expressed in Escherichia coli using the expression vector pET/OVA constructed and purified as described previously (41Takahashi N. Orita T. Hirose M. Gene. 1995; 161: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A single carbohydrate chain of authentic OVA is absent in recombinant OVA, but its secondary structure and biophysical properties have been shown to be the same as those of authentic OVA except for a lower Tm of heat-induced unfolding (41Takahashi N. Orita T. Hirose M. Gene. 1995; 161: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to introduce mutations and to amplify the full-length plasmid. The secondary structures of the mutants have been confirmed to be identical to that of intact OVA using CD spectroscopy. A 5 mg/ml solution of authentic OVA was diluted in buffer preheated to 80 °C in the optical cell of the spectrophotometer so that the final OVA concentration was 0.5 mg/ml. The kinetics of aggregation at 80 °C was monitored through turbidity change of the solution using absorbance readings at 320 nm. The kinetics of aggregation of recombinant OVA was measured at the final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml using absorbance at 420 nm. The decrease in the concentration of non-denatured OVA under heat-denaturing conditions was determined by GPC assays as reported previously (42Weijers M. Barneveld P.A. Cohen Stuart M.A. Visschers R.W. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2693-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A 0.2 mg/ml OVA solution was incubated at 80 °C for various periods of time and then cooled down to room temperature. The solution was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min to remove large aggregates so that the proteins in the supernatant consisted of non-denatured OVA and small aggregates. The non-denatured OVA in solution was separated by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 280 nm. Concentration of non-denatured OVA in the supernatant was determined from the intensity of its peak in the chromatogram after normalizing peak intensity against solutions of native OVA of known concentration. The secondary structure of OVA was monitored by CD spectroscopic measurement using a Jasco J-720 (Tokyo, Japan). An optical cell with a 1-mm path length was used. The far-UV spectrum at 25 °C was measured with a scan speed of 20 nm/min. TEM images of OVA aggregates and amyloid fibrils of peptides were acquired with a JEM-1200EX II transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 85 keV. The samples were negatively stained with 1.5–2.0% phosphotungstate adjusted to pH 7.5 using sodium hydroxide. FTIR spectra were recorded using a Spectrum GX (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Spectral resolution was 2 cm−1, and the spectra of 64 scans were averaged. The intact OVA and SH-OVA were dissolved in D2O, and the pD was adjusted to 7.5. The peptides were first dissolved in HFIP and then dispersed in D2O. The solution was heat-treated at 80 °C for 1 h, and the precipitates were washed twice with D2O. The spectra of protein and peptide samples dried on a CaF2 window were measured. Calorimetric measurements were performed using Nano-DSC II Model 6100 (Calorimetry Science Co., Lindon, UT). All experiments were carried out at a scan rate of 1.0 °C/min and protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml in 150 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 60 mm DTT. Data analysis (base-line subtraction and concentration normalization) was performed using software from Calorimetry Science. The size of heat-induced aggregates of OVA in solution was measured by a DLS 7000 instrument (Otsuka Electronics, Osaka, Japan) at 25 °C. The helium-neon laser light with a 630-nm wavelength was used as the light source at a set angle of 45°. OVA solution at 1.0 mg/ml was diluted 10 times with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl and incubated at 80 °C for 1 h. Experimental data were analyzed using the NNLS algorithm provided by the manufacturer. The core region involved in the fibril was mapped by identifying the local region that is not susceptible to proteolytic cleavage as reported previously (22Onda M. Nakatani K. Takehara S. Nishiyama M. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 17568-17578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 40Takahashi N. Koseki T. Doi E. Hirose M.

Biochem. 2004; 68: 2466-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A 2 mg/ml solution of OVA was heat-treated at 80 °C for 1 h and then digested with trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C. The enzyme/protein concentration ratio was 1:100 (w/w). The tryptic digestion of SH-OVA fibrils was performed after removing DTT from the aggregate by centrifugation. The digestion fragments were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE before transfer onto a PVDF membrane for sequencing. The N-terminal sequence analysis was performed by a Procise 492 sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The prediction of core regions for amyloid fibril formation of OVA was performed using three different algorithms that are freely available on the World Wide Web (44Fernandez-Escamilla A.M. Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J. Serrano L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1302-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 45Trovato A. Seno F. Tosatto S.C. Protein Eng. Des.

BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 65Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The prediction by the TANGO (44Fernandez-Escamilla A.M. Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J. Serrano L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1302-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar) and PASTA (45Trovato A. Seno F. Tosatto S.C. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2007; 20: 521-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) algorithms is based on the physicochemical background (i.e. calculation of the energy stabilizing the conformation of β-aggregation). TANGO calculates the partition function of the phase space encompassing the random coil and the native conformations as well as other major conformational states, namely β-turn, α-helix, and β-aggregate. The frequency of population of each structural state for five segments is assumed to be relative to its energy, which is derived from statistical and empirical considerations. PASTA calculates the pairing energy of two residues in the parallel in-register arrangement of β-strands. Two different propensity sets were extracted depending on the orientation of the neighboring strands from a data base of known native structures of globular proteins. Distinct protein molecules involved in the fibril formation are assumed to adopt the minimum energy β-pairings in order to better stabilize the cross-β-core. AGGRESCAN (46Conchillo-Solé O. de Groot N.S. Avilés F.X. Vendrell J. Daura X. Ventura S. BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 65Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) predicts highly aggregation-prone regions based on the aggregation propensity of individual amino acids derived from in vivo experiments for amyloid β. The highly aggregation-prone regions in the sequence were identified as those protein regions at least five residues in length in which the aggregation propensity is above the average aggregation propensity of the complete sequence. Effects of disulfide reduction on the heat-induced fibril formation of OVA were investigated by monitoring the progress of heat-induced aggregation of intact OVA and SH-OVA. The thioflavin T fluorescence is commonly used for the detection of amyloid fibril. However, the fluorescence intensity of thioflavin T bound to OVA fibril is very low at 80 °C, and the kinetic measurement of OVA fibril formation at elevated temperature is difficult. Therefore, we monitored the aggregation of OVA at 80 °C by turbidity measurements using a spectrophotometer. An OVA solution was diluted in buffer preheated to 80 °C in the optical cell of the spectrophotometer so that the final OVA concentration was 0.5 mg/ml. The kinetics of aggregation was monitored by measuring the turbidity change of the solution using absorbance at 320 nm. As shown in Fig. 2a, the turbidity of SH-OVA increased to a greater extent compared with that of intact OVA. This finding suggests that the heat-induced aggregate of OVA grew faster when the single disulfide bond was reduced. The progress of heat-induced aggregation was also monitored by the concentration change in non-denatured OVA solution as estimated from the GPC chromatogram (42Weijers M. Barneveld P.A. Cohen Stuart M.A. Visschers R.W. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2693-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Initially, the large aggregates of OVA were separated from non-denatured protein and small aggregates by centrifugation of the heat-treated OVA solution. The non-denatured OVA in the supernatant was separated from OVA aggregates by gel filtration chromatography, and its concentration was determined from the peak intensity in the chromatogram. The decrease in the concentration of non-denatured OVA with heating time was plotted in Fig. 2b. As shown in this figure, the rate of decrease of non-denatured OVA is much faster than the turbidity increase, with the progress of the OVA aggregation shown in Fig. 2a. These results indicate that small aggregates of protein are formed in the early stage of OVA aggregation, followed by slow association between these aggregates to form larger aggregates that pellet upon centrifugation. The concentration of non-denatured SH-OVA decreased faster than that of intact OVA, indicating that reduction of the single disulfide bond accelerated the heat-induced unfolding of OVA, which is consistent with the previous report that the conformational stability of OVA is lowered by the reduction of the disulfide bond (40Takahashi N. Koseki T. Doi E. Hirose M. J Biochem. 1991; 109: 846-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The effect of the disulfide bond reduction on the heat-induced aggregation of OVA was further examined by monitoring the morphology of heat-induced aggregates by TEM (Fig. 3). Intact OVA formed semiflexible fibrillar aggregates from heat treatment at 80 °C. Interestingly, heat treatment of SH-OVA resulted in the formation of long straight fibrils, which were distinct from the semiflexible fibrils formed by intact OVA. The secondary structures of these OVA aggregates were analyzed by measuring FTIR (Fig. 4). Native OVA has a broad amide I band with a maximum at 1650 cm−1. In contrast, heat-induced OVA aggregates produce an amide I band with a maximum at 1625 cm−1, which indicates higher β-sheet content. Curve fitting of the spectra shows that the amide I band of OVA aggregates contains β-sheet components that can be detected at 1625 and 1680 cm−1, which are different from those of native OVA that absorb at 1631 and 1684 cm−1. The different positions of the β-sheet components indicate that the aggregates do not have the same β-sheet structure as that of the native OVA conformation. The β-sheet content of OVA aggregates was estimated to be 55% from the areas of these components, which is more than that of the native conformation (45%). The profile of the amide I band of aggregates formed from SH-OVA (Fig. 4, red open circles) is almost identical to that formed from intact OVA despite its distinct morphology.FIGURE 4The secondary structure of native OVA and OVA aggregates monitored by FTIR spectroscopy. Top, the amide I band of native OVA; bottom, the amide I band of heat-induced aggregates obtained from intact OVA (black open circle) and SH-OVA (red open circle).

https://openalex.org/W2051423453,"Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) regulates the homeostasis of sphingolipids, including ceramides and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Because sphingolipids regulate AKT activation, we investigated the role of ASM in hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. Initially, we overexpressed ASM in the livers of wild-type and diabetic db/db mice by adenovirus vector (Ad5ASM). In these mice, glucose tolerance was improved, and glycogen and lipid accumulation in the liver were increased. Using primary cultured hepatocytes, we confirmed that ASM increased glucose uptake, glycogen deposition, and lipid accumulation through activation of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase-3β. In addition, ASM induced up-regulation of glucose transporter 2 accompanied by suppression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. Loss of sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) diminished ASM-mediated AKT phosphorylation, but exogenous S1P induced AKT activation in hepatocytes. In contrast, SphK1 deficiency did not affect AMPK activation. These results suggest that the SphK/S1P pathway is required for ASM-mediated AKT activation but not for AMPK inactivation. Finally, we found that treatment with high-dose glucose increased glycogen deposition and lipid accumulation in wild-type hepatocytes but not in ASM_/_ cells. This result is consistent with glucose intolerance in ASM_/_ mice. In conclusion, ASM modulates AKT activation and AMPK inactivation, thus regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver.—Osawa, Y., Seki, E., Kodama, Y., Suetsugu, A., Miura, K., Adachi, M., Ito, H., Shiratori, Y., Banno, Y., Olefsky, J.

https://openalex.org/W2051350778,"We report the optimization of a family of human single chain antibody fragments (scFv) for neutralizing two scorpion venoms. The parental scFv 3F recognizes the main toxins of Centruroides noxius Hoffmann (Cn2) and Centruroides suffusus suffusus (Css2), albeit with low affinity. This scFv was subjected to independent processes of directed evolution to improve its recognition toward Cn2 (Riaño-Umbarila, L., Juárez-González, V. R., Olamendi-Portugal, T., Ortíz-León, M., Possani, L. D., and Becerril, B. (2005) FEBS J. 272, 2591-2601) and Css2 (this work). Each evolved variant showed strong cross-reactivity against several toxins, and was capable of neutralizing Cn2 and Css2. Furthermore, each variant neutralized the whole venoms of the above species. As far as we know, this is the first report of antibodies with such characteristics. Maturation processes revealed key residue changes to attain expression, stability, and affinity improvements as compared with the parental scFv. Combination of these changes resulted in the scFv LR, which is capable of rescuing mice from severe envenomation by 3 LD(50) of freshly prepared whole venom of C. noxius (7.5 μg/20 g of mouse) and C. suffusus (26.25 μg/20 g of mouse), with surviving rates between 90 and 100%.

https://openalex.org/W2074205741,"Arenaviruses are responsible for acute hemorrhagic fevers worldwide and are recognized to pose significant threats to public health and biodefense. Small molecule compounds have recently been discovered that inhibit arenavirus entry and protect against lethal infection in animal models. These chemically distinct inhibitors act on the tripartite envelope glycoprotein (GPC) through its unusual stable signal peptide subunit to stabilize the complex against pH-induced activation of membrane fusion in the endosome. Here, we report the production and characterization of the intact transmembrane GPC complex of Junín arenavirus and its interaction with these inhibitors. The solubilized GPC is antigenically indistinguishable from the native protein and forms a homogeneous trimer in solution. When reconstituted into a lipid bilayer, the purified complex interacts specifically with its cell-surface receptor transferrin receptor-1. We show that small molecule entry inhibitors specific to New World or Old World arenaviruses bind to the membrane-associated GPC complex in accordance with their respective species selectivities and with dissociation constants comparable with concentrations that inhibit GPC-mediated membrane fusion. Furthermore, competitive binding studies reveal that these chemically distinct inhibitors share a common binding pocket on GPC. In conjunction with previous genetic studies, these findings identify the pH-sensing interface of GPC as a highly vulnerable target for antiviral intervention. This work expands our mechanistic understanding of arenavirus entry and provides a foundation to guide the development of small molecule compounds for the treatment of arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers."

Angiogenesis related targets are readily accessible; however, the relatively low abundance of endothelial cells in tumor tissue makes the molecular imaging of tumor neovessels more challenging. Furthermore, angiogenesis may occur also in a physiological context, thus adding more complexity to the targeting. With these limitations in mind, we hypothesized as an alternative target a marker selectively expressed in different compartments in the tumor area. One targeting agent specific for the tumor but not restricted to the tumor cells is the tumor homing peptide (LyP-1), which strongly and specifically accumulates in the tumor after systemic administration, localizing preferentially associated to lymphatic markers (8Laakkonen P.

In this work, we take advantage of the over-expression of the multicompartmental p32/gClqR (hereafter referred to as p32) associated to tumors (in tumor cells, tumor lymphatics, and tumor-associated macrophages) to generate a human anti-p32 single-chain Fv (scFv) 4The abbreviations used are: scFvsingle-chain fragment variableNIP4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitrophenylrhp32recombinant human p32. antibody (2.15). This antibody has shown to selectively target solid tumors in vivo both as a monovalent and trivalent antibody fragment. single-chain fragment variable 4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitrophenyl recombinant human p32. All cells were from the ATCC. HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney epithelia; CRL-1573), and MDA-MB-231 (human breast adenocarcinoma; HTB-26) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (all from Invitrogen) in humidified CO2 (5%) incubator at 37 °C. U-937 cells (human histiocytic lymphoma; CRL-1593.2) and 4T1 cells (mouse breast tumor; CRL-2539) were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS. Differentiation of the U-937 cells was induced for the indicated time intervals in fresh culture medium containing 5 nm phorbol myristic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). Recombinant human p32 (rhp32) was obtained from bacteria and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Recombinant mouse p32 was purchased from United States Biological (USBio). Purified rabbit polyclonal anti-full-length p32 was directed against the N terminus (amino acids 76–93). The mAbs used included mouse anti-p32 (60.11 and 74.5.2), anti-human c-Myc 9.E10, FITC-conjugated anti-human c-Myc 9.E10 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK); anti-human MHC class I molecules W6/32 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA); rat anti-mouse CD31 (BD Biosciences); HRP-conjugated anti-human c-Myc (Invitrogen); and HRP-conjugated anti-M13 bacteriophage (GE Healthcare). The polyclonal antibodies used included an Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Invitrogen); a phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Europe, Suffolk, UK); an HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG; and an HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare). Trypsin, BSA, o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, and isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside were from Sigma-Aldrich. BSA was conjugated with 4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitrophenyl (NIP; Sigma-Aldrich) in a molar ratio of 10:1 (NIP10-BSA) as described (28Hawkins R.E. Russell S.J. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Mouse EHS-laminin (LM111) was from (BD Biosciences). Recombinant scFv phages (Griffin.1 library, Medical Research Council Cambridge; total diversity, ∼1.2 × 109) (29Griffiths A.D. Williams S.C. Hartley O. Tomlinson I.M. Waterhouse P. Crosby W.L. Kontermann R.E. Jones P.T. Low N.M. Allison T.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3245-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) were panned for binding on purified antigen (rhp32) as described (30Nissim A. Hoogenboom H.R. Tomlinson I.M. Flynn G. Midgley C. Lane D. Winter G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) with slight modifications: immunotubes (Maxisorp, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 4 ml of rhp32 at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in PBS. After washing twice with PBS, the tubes were blocked for 2 h at 37 °C with 4% BSA in PBS. Meanwhile, 1013 phages were blocked with 1 ml 4% BSA in PBS. Preblocked phages were added to the immunotube and incubated at room temperature with continuous rotation for 30 min, followed by 90 min of stationary incubation. The tubes were washed 10 times (in the first round of selection, 20 in the subsequent selections) with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then with PBS. Bound phages were eluted with 1 ml of trypsin (1 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2) at room temperature with continuous rotation for 20 min. Eluted phages were recovered by infecting logarithmically growing (A600 = 0.5) Escherichia coli TG1 (K12, Δ(lac-pro), supE, thi, hsdD5/F′traD36, proA+B+, lacIq, lacZΔM15 (31.Gibson, T., (1984) Studies in the Epstein-Barr Virus Genome, Ph.D. thesis, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.Google Scholar)) at 37 °C for 30 min. The infected cells were plated on LB agar supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose and incubated overnight at 37 °C. This enriched library was grown on E. coli TG1 and rescued upon infection with the helper phage KM13 (32Kristensen P. Winter G. Folding Des. 1998; 3: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Phages displaying scFv fragments were purified from the culture supernatant by precipitation with 20% PEG 6000 and 2.5 m NaCl and were resuspended in sterile cold PBS with 15% glycerol for long term storage at −80 °C and for subsequent rounds of selection. Single colonies were screened by ELISA to evaluate the frequency of phage displaying rhp32-binding scFv fragments as described (33Sanz L. Kristensen P. Russell S.J. Ramirez García J.R. Alvarez-Vallina L. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2001; 50: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). rhp32-binding phages were fingerprinted by amplifying the scFv using primers LMB3 and FdSeq1 (LMB3, 5′-CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG AC-3′; FdSeq1, 5′-GAA TTT TCT GTA TGA GG-3′) followed by digestion with the frequent cutting enzyme BstN-I (New England Biolabs). Molecular characterization was completed by sequencing the variable regions using primers FOR_LinkSeq (VH; 5′-GCC ACC TCC GCC TGA ACC-3′) and pHEN_Seq (VL; 5′-CTA TGC GGC CCC ATT CA-3′). Sequences were analyzed and aligned to the VBASE2 database (34Retter I. Althaus H.H. Münch R. Müller W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D671-D674Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) to learn the amino acids forming the loops in the complementarity-determining regions used and type of chains present. Phage particles from selected clones were used to infect logarithmically growing (A600 = 0.5) E. coli HB2151 (nonsuppresser strain (K12, ara, Δ(lac-pro), thi/F′ proA+B+, lacIqZΔM15 (35Carter P. Bedouelle H. Winter G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4431-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar)), and soluble scFv fragments were obtained as described (33Sanz L. Kristensen P. Russell S.J. Ramirez García J.R. Alvarez-Vallina L. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2001; 50: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Purification was performed using the ÄKTAprime plus system (affinity step: HisTrap or HiTrap rProtein A FF columns (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's protocol followed by gel filtration HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S100-HR) and checked by ELISA and SDS-PAGE. Either supernatant from isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced HB2151 or purified scFv was used. Competition ELISA was performed as a standard ELISA but with a previous step of blockade using mAb; after blocking with 300 μl 4% BSA in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h, wells were incubated with 100 μl of a 20 μg/ml solution of the appropriate reagent (mAb 60.11, mAb 74.5.2, or control mouse IgG1) for 1 h at room temperature and 30 rpm. To study the ability of the scFv to detect p32 on the cell surface, unstimulated mouse 4T1 cells and phorbol myristic acid-stimulated human U-937 cells (5 nm for 3, 6, or 12 h prior to the staining) were incubated with anti-p32 mAb (5 μg/ml) or purified scFv (10 μg/ml) and mAb 9E10 (4 μg/ml) in 100 μl for 45 min. After washing, the cells were treated with appropriate dilutions of phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The samples were analyzed with an EPICS XL (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). The coding sequence of the scFv 2.15 was amplified using primers ClaI-2.15 (5′-TCA TCG ATG GAG GTG CAG CTG GTG GAG-3′) and FdSeq1 and ligated into pCR2.1 TOPO. The ClaI/NotI-digested fragment was ligated into the ClaI/NotI pCR3.1-L36-NC1ES−-digested plasmid (6Cuesta A.M. Sánchez-Martín D. Sanz L. Bonet J. Compte M. Kremer L. Blanco F.J. Oliva B. Alvarez-Vallina L. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5381Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) to obtained the pCR3.1–2.15-NC1ES− plasmid. All constructs were verified by sequencing. The details about the plasmid pCEP4-B1.8-NC1ES− containing the B1.8 (anti-NIP) trimerbody and the procedure to obtain purified trimerbodies can be found elsewhere (6Cuesta A.M. Sánchez-Martín D. Sanz L. Bonet J. Compte M. Kremer L. Blanco F.J. Oliva B. Alvarez-Vallina L. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5381Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Purified antibodies (scFvs and trimerbodies) were labeled with the near-infrared cyanine 5 (Cy5) N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. One milliliter of the antibody solution (1 mg/ml) was conjugated with 0.1 ml of a 2 mg/ml Cy5 solution for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. Cy5-labeled recombinant antibodies were separated from unconjugated Cy5 dye by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 Superfine HiTrap Desalting columns (PD-10 columns, GE Healthcare), and concentrated in 10,000 molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) Vivaspin 500 filter (Vivascience) to 1 mg/ml. The labeling ratio of Cy5 to antibody (Cy5:antibody) was calculated as described (36Birchler M. Neri G. Tarli L. Halin C. Viti F. Neri D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 231: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and was close to 1:(1–2). The functionality of Cy5-labeled antibodies was verified by ELISA against specific antigen. Imaging was performed as described (6Cuesta A.M. Sánchez-Martín D. Sanz L. Bonet J. Compte M. Kremer L. Blanco F.J. Oliva B. Alvarez-Vallina L. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5381Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells (2 × 106) were implanted into the mammary fat pad of 6-week-old female Hsd:athymic nude-Foxn1nu mice (Harlan Ibérica, Barcelona, Spain) maintained with a low manganese diet (ssniff Spezialdiäten GMBH, Soest, Germany). Nodule dimensions were used to calculate tumor volume using the formula: width2 × length × 0.52. When tumors reached a volume of 0.2–0.4 cm3, mice were injected in the tail vein with 100 μl Cy5-labeled antibody solution in PBS. Mice were imaged using the high resolution charge-coupled device cooled digital camera ORCA-2BT and Hokawo software (Hamamatsu Photonics France, Massy, France) under anesthesia. Three images were acquired for each experiment: a bright field image, a Cy5-specific image (emission, red light filter centered at 632.8 nm; optical filter, 665–680 nm), and an autofluorescence reference image (emission, blue light filtered at 470 nm; optical filter, 665–680 nm). Normalized reference autofluorescence was subtracted from the Cy5-specific image, and the resultant was tinted and merged with the bright-field image (tinted in the GFP blue-shifted spectral (448 nm) for better contrast) using the Hokawo software. Further editing included only cropping, resizing, and rotating the image for a better view of the picture. All mice were handled in accordance with the guidelines of the Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in accordance with Spanish legislation. Tumors were removed after infrared imaging (2.5 h after i.v. injection), frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) embedding medium (Sakura Tissue Tek, Alphen aan den Rijn, The Netherlands), and sectioned (4–7-μm thickness) using the Leica CM1850 cryostat. Sections were incubated overnight with the primary antibodies (anti-Myc:FITC antibody (1:200) and rat anti-mouse CD31 (1:100)), followed by anti-rat secondary reagents (1:1000), and mounted by using VectaShield mounting media with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were acquired using a confocal scanning inverted Leica AOBS/SP2-microscope (Leica Microsystems). The Griffin.1 library was panned against affinity purified recombinant human p32 (rhp32) immobilized in Nunc immunotubes. The frequency of binding clones was studied by ELISA after each round of selection. The percentage of binders was 20% after the first round and 60% after the second. BstN1 fingerprinting of 24 selected clones (by rhp32/BSA ratio (in preliminary 96-well ELISA) > 3) indicated 16 different restriction patterns, which were later confirmed by DNA sequencing. Ten different clones that were consistent binders were used in a phage-ELISA assay against rhp32 and other unrelated proteins (Fig. 1A). Most of the clones were highly specific for rhp32, showing almost no reactivity against other elements present in the selection process (plastic and BSA) or an unrelated protein (LM111). After expression as soluble scFv, although different from clone to clone, there was a significant reactivity of most of the scFvs against rhp32 (Fig. 1B). The binding of LyP-1 phage to p32 is inhibited by monoclonal antibody 60.11, which is directed against the C1q binding domain of p32 (10Fogal V. Zhang L. Krajewski S. Ruoslahti E. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7210-7218Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To identify scFv sharing the epitope with mAb 60.11, four scFv fragments (1.6, 2.9, 2.15, and 2.25) were expressed using the nonsuppressor host E. coli HB2151 and purified from the supernatant by standard affinity chromatography procedures. The purified scFv fragments gave rise to a single protein band of expected mobility (Fig. 1C, inset); a competition ELISA was designed using either mAb 60.11 directed against p32 N-terminal amino acids 76–93 or 74.5.2 directed against amino acids 204–218 from the C terminus of p32. Preincubation with 60.11 but not 74.5.2 greatly diminished the binding of scFv 2.9 and 2.15, indicating overlapping, if not identical, epitopes (Fig. 1C). Due to the degree of cross-species conservation between rodents and humans, both in sequence and in the ability to bind C1q (37Lynch N.J. Reid K.B. van den Berg R.H. Daha M.R. Leigh L.A. Ghebrehiwet B. Lim W.B. Schwaeble W.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we further investigated whether the selected scFv fragments were able to bind immobilized purified recombinant mouse p32. It was found that 2.9 gave no signal on recombinant mouse p32, whereas 2.15 gave comparable signals on both mouse and human p32 immobilized on plastic (Fig. 1D). The ability of the scFv fragments to recognize cell surface-expressed p32 was assessed by flow cytometry using freshly purified soluble scFv. Nonstimulated human U-937 cells reacted minimally with either anti-p32 mAbs (60.11 or 74.5.2) or scFv (2.9 or 2.15) (data not shown). In contrast, U-937 activation with phorbol myristic acid produced a consistently increased p32 expression as reflected by mAbs and scFv fragments. Staining with mAb 60.11 showed that ∼50% of stimulated U-937 cells expressed p32 in the surface (Fig. 2A). Purified scFv fragments corresponding to 2.9 and 2.15, also stained the U-937 cells, and a slightly higher percentage of the cells were stained than with the 60.11 antibody (Fig. 2A). Surface staining of mouse 4T1 cells demonstrated the presence of p32 on the cell surface, in agreement with previous studies (10Fogal V. Zhang L. Krajewski S. Ruoslahti E. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7210-7218Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The mAb 60.11 produced a small but consistent shift in flow cytometry analysis of live 4T1 cells (Fig. 2B). A similar staining pattern was observed in 4T1 cells incubated with the 2.15 scFv. In contrast, incubation of 4T1 cells with 2.9 scFv revealed no staining (Fig. 2B). Thus, further corroborating the ability of 2.15 to detect the mouse cell surface p32 to a extent similar to the mAb 60.11. We selected the scFv 2.15 for in vivo targeting assays based on its inhibition by the 60.11 mAb as shown by ELISA on its ability to detect p32 expressed in the surface of both human and mouse cells as shown by flow cytometry. Control scFv antibodies included the following: B1.8 (anti-hapten NIP) and L36 (recognizes a conformational epitope of LM111 exposed in several solid tumor models (6Cuesta A.M. Sánchez-Martín D. Sanz L. Bonet J. Compte M. Kremer L. Blanco F.J. Oliva B. Alvarez-Vallina L. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5381Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)). Antibodies were labeled with the near-infrared fluorochrome Cy5 and injected in the tail vein of nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 human xenografts. All of the antibodies showed a rapid renal clearance after i.v. injection, with peak signal intensity at 1–2 h and no detectable bladder signal at 24 h post-injection (Fig. 3B). The control scFv-B1.8 showed no detectable localization, whereas both 2.15 and L36 localized in the tumors (Fig. 3A). Maximum resolution was achieved at ∼2h (Fig. 3A), when the ratio of the signal of the 2.15 and that of the B1.8 was near 7 (supplemental Fig. 1). Ex vivo imaging of the organs further confirms the specific accumulation of 2.15 and L36 in the tumors, while showing a similar uptake by the kidneys for all the antibodies (Fig. 3C). Staining of the tumors from mice that received the scFvs with FITC-conjugated anti-Myc mAb (to detect the injected scFv) and anti-CD31 mAb showed that most of the endothelial cells were negative for the scFv, and most of the scFv staining was dispersed in clusters of cells (Fig. 4, white arrow). However, some of the main vessels showed a distinct co-staining in the basal side of the cells (Fig. 4, arrowhead).FIGURE 42.15 scFv recognizes dispersed clusters of cells and the basal side of endothelial cells. After i.v. administration of the scFv, tumors were removed, embedded in OCT, and stained for myc (green) or for an endothelial marker (CD31, red). A, B1.8 does not localize in the tumor stroma. It does not localize either associated with vessels (right panel). B, 2.15 localizes in the tumor in dispersed clusters of cells (white arrow). A distinct co-staining occurred in the basal side of endothelial cells (arrowhead and right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously reported that the trimerbody format offers advantages over scFv molecules for tumor-targeting applications in vivo against a cell surface antigen or an extracellular matrix antigen (LM111) (6Cuesta A.M. Sánchez-Martín D. Sanz L. Bonet J. Compte M. Kremer L. Blanco F.J. Oliva B. Alvarez-Vallina L. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5381Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that an anti-p32 trimerbody would also surpass its scFv counterpart for in vivo imaging. For this reason, the 2.15 scFv was assembled in the trimerbody format and expressed as a soluble secreted protein in human HEK-293 cells and purified from conditioned medium. The purification scheme yielded antibodies that were >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. The functionality of purified 2.15 trimerbody was demonstrated by ELISA against rhp32 (supplemental Fig. 2). Trimerbodies (2.15 and B1.8) were labeled with Cy5 and injected in the tail vein of nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 human xenografts. Trimerbodies showed slower clearance than the corresponding scFvs (Fig. 5B). The control B1.8 trimerbody showed no detectable localization in the tumor, whereas a strong and selective accumulation was observed in the case of the 2.15 trimerbody. Maximum tumor uptake was detected at 2.5 and 5 h; the signal intensity decreased at 24 h although remained detectable for at least 48 h (Fig. 5A), whereas most of the systemic protein was eliminated at 24h (Fig. 5B). We have generated a human recombinant antibody against the multicompartmental protein p32/gClqR. We have demonstrated the ability of different formats of this antibody (scFv and trimerbody) to target solid tumors in vivo. These results represent a new concept in tumor targeting. So far, antibody-based tumor targeting strategies have been based on tumor-associated cell surface antigens or tumor-associated vascular markers. Antibodies specific to tumor surface antigens, such as HER2-neu (38Harries M. Smith I. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2002; 9: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), carcinoembryonic antigen (39Begent R.H. Verhaar M.J. Chester K.A. Casey J.L. Green A.J. Napier M.P. Hope-Stone L.D. Cushen N. Keep P.A. Johnson C.J. Hawkins R.E. Hilson A.J. Robson L. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), or prostate-specific antigen (40McDevitt M.R. Barendswaard E. Ma D. Lai L. Curcio M.J. Sgouros G. Ballangrud A.M. Yang W.H. Finn R.D. Pellegrini V. Geerlings Jr., M.W. Lee M. Brechbiel M.W. Bander N.H. Cordon-Cardo C. Scheinberg D.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6095-6100PubMed Google Scholar), among others, have proven useful for in vivo localization of solid tumors. However, tumor surface antigens exhibit a high shedding profile and are dependent on tumor dedifferentiation or clonal proliferation. Antigens that are preferentially expressed in the tumor extracellular matrix may be better suited for tumor-targeting applications. In fact, several groups have demonstrated that antibodies specific to components of the extracellular matrix (EDB domain of fibronectin (41Neri D. Carnemolla B. Nissim A. Leprini A. Querzè G. Balza E. Pini A. Tarli L. Halin C. Neri P. Zardi L. Winter G. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1271-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), domain C of tenascin C (42Silacci M. Brack S.S.

Ramirez García J.R. Alvarez-Vallina L. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2001; 50: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) were capable of selective targeting of neovascular structures in solid tumors. However, it has been shown that antibodies against tumor-associated vascular markers fail to accumulate in nonproliferating tumors (43Birchler M.T. Thuerl C. Schmid D. Neri D. Waibel R. Schubiger A. Stoeckli S.J. Schmid S. Goerres G.W. Otolaryngol. Head Neck. Surg. 2007; 136: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that this can be a major problem in a proportion of patients as well as certain types of tumors with a very low growth rate. Although p32 has been reported in the surface of several other cell types under certain circunstances (fibroblasts, neutrophils, endothelial cells, platelets, etc. (15Eggleton P. Tenner A.J. Reid K.B. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 120: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)), the majority of the protein is cytoplasmic and is detectable after permeabilization of the cell membrane (44van den Berg R.H. Prins F. Faber-Krol M.C. Lynch N.J. Schwaeble W. van Es L.A. Daha M.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3909-3916PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, certain cells are able to translocate and release the protein, which can result in the modification of a number of cellular and vascular protein responses (15Eggleton P. Tenner A.J. Reid K.B. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 120: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The role of cell surface p32 in the tumor remains unclear; however, the unique expression pattern of p32 in tumor cells, tumor lymphatics, and tumor-associated macrophages/myeloid cells makes p32 an ideal target for the diagnosis and therapy of cancer. In fact, it has been reported that p32/gC1qR is the receptor for a tumor-homing peptide, LyP-1. The LyP-1 peptide has been shown to localize in the tumor lymphatics (9Laakkonen P. Porkka K. Hoffman J.A. Ruoslahti E. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), and to effectively target nanoparticles to the tumor (45Karmali P.P. Kotamraju V.R. Kastantin M. Black M. Missirlis D. Tirrell M. Ruoslahti E. Nanomedicine. 2009; 5: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In this work, we confirmed that systemically administered 2.15 scFv penetrates the tumor covering a broad population of cells but in a pattern distinct from that of the LyP-1 peptide (8Laakkonen P. Akerman M.E. Biliran H. Yang M. Ferrer F. Karpanen T. Hoffman R.M. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9381-9386Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 9Laakkonen P. Porkka K. Hoffman J.A. Ruoslahti E. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Although LyP-1 is probably processed as a CendR peptide upon binding to p32 and thus can actively penetrate the tissue (46Ruoslahti E. Bhatia S.N. Sailor M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 47Teesalu T. Sugahara K.N. Kotamraju V.R. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16157-16162Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), the antibody may remain partially bound to the p32 readily accessible from the lumen of the blood vessels and also reach some clusters of cells (probably macrophages) in the stroma nearby. Multimerization of scFv constructs has important advantages for tumor-targeting applications. Trimerbodies are intermediate-sized molecules that exhibit high stability under physiological conditions and enhanced avidity for the target owing to the trivalent structure (6Cuesta A.M. Sánchez-Martín D. Sanz L. Bonet J. Compte M. Kremer L. Blanco F.J. Oliva B. Alvarez-Vallina L. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5381Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 48Cuesta A.M. Sainz-Pastor N. Bonet J. Oliva B. Alvarez-Vallina L. Trends Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 355-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In fact, we report that the 2.15 antibody in a trimerbody format stained the tumor more brightly than the 2.15 scFv at all time points. Anti-p32 trimerbody localized rapidly and specifically in the tumors. The tumor uptake reached a maximum at 2.5–5 h post injection and slowly washed out over time. Fluorescence was still detectable in the tumor 48 h after the trimerbody inoculation. In summary, we have demonstrated that the human anti-p32 antibody 2.15 can selectively localize tumors in vivo. These results illustrate the potential of this new antibody for imaging and therapeutic applications and suggest that p32 might be universal target for cancer targeting. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W1969154139,"The inhibitory T-cell surface-expressed receptor, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), which belongs to the class of cell surface proteins phosphorylated by extrinsic tyrosine kinases that also includes antigen receptors, binds the related ligands, B7-1 and B7-2, expressed on antigen-presenting cells. Conformational changes are commonly invoked to explain ligand-induced ""triggering"" of this class of receptors. Crystal structures of ligand-bound CTLA-4 have been reported, but not the apo form, precluding analysis of the structural changes accompanying ligand binding. The 1.8-Å resolution structure of an apo human CTLA-4 homodimer emphasizes the shared evolutionary history of the CTLA-4/CD28 subgroup of the immunoglobulin superfamily and the antigen receptors. The ligand-bound and unbound forms of both CTLA-4 and B7-1 are remarkably similar, in marked contrast to B7-2, whose binding to CTLA-4 has elements of induced fit. Isothermal titration calorimetry reveals that ligand binding by CTLA-4 is enthalpically driven and accompanied by unfavorable entropic changes. The similarity of the thermodynamic parameters determined for the interactions of CTLA-4 with B7-1 and B7-2 suggests that the binding is not highly specific, but the conformational changes observed for B7-2 binding suggest some level of selectivity. The new structure establishes that rigid-body ligand interactions are capable of triggering CTLA-4 phosphorylation by extrinsic kinase(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2013969219,"Protein kinase D (PKD) exists as a family of structurally related enzymes that are activated through similar phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms involving protein kinase C (PKC). While individual PKD isoforms could in theory mediate distinct biological functions, previous studies identify a high level of functional redundancy for PKD1 and PKD2 in various cellular contexts. This study shows that PKD1 and PKD2 are activated in a stimulus-specific manner in neonatal cardiomyocytes. The α1-adrenergic receptor agonist norepinephrine selectively activates PKD1, thrombin and PDGF selectively activate PKD2, and endothelin-1 and PMA activate both PKD1 and PKD2. PKC activity is implicated in the α1-adrenergic receptor pathway that activates PKD1 and the thrombin- and PDGF-dependent pathways that activate PKD2. Endothelin-1 activates PKD via both rapid PKC-dependent and more sustained PKC-independent mechanisms. The functional consequences of PKD activation were assessed by tracking phosphorylation of CREB and cardiac troponin I (cTnI), two physiologically relevant PKD substrates in cardiomyocytes. We show that overexpression of an activated PKD1-S744E/S748E transgene increases CREB-Ser133 and cTnI-Ser23/Ser24 phosphorylation, but agonist-dependent pathways that activate native PKD1 or PKD2 selectively increase CREB-Ser133 phosphorylation; there is no associated increase in cTnI-Ser23/Ser24 phosphorylation. Gene silencing studies provide unanticipated evidence that PKD1 down-regulation leads to a compensatory increase in PKD2 activity and that down-regulation of PKD1 (alone or in combination with PKD2) leads to an increase in CREB-Ser133 phosphorylation. Collectively, these studies identify distinct roles for native PKD1 and PKD2 enzymes in stress-dependent pathways that influence cardiac remodeling and the progression of heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2050251713,"Although both metastatic tumor antigen 1 (MTA1), a master chromatin modifier, and transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a multifunctional enzyme, are known to be activated during inflammation, it remains unknown whether these molecules regulate inflammatory response in a coordinated manner. Here we investigated the role of MTA1 in the regulation of TG2 expression in bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mammalian cells. While studying the impact of MTA1 status on global gene expression, we unexpectedly discovered that MTA1 depletion impairs the basal as well as the LPS-induced expression of TG2 in multiple experimental systems. We found that TG2 is a chromatin target of MTA1 and of NF-κB signaling in LPS-stimulated cells. In addition, LPS-mediated stimulation of TG2 expression is accompanied by the enhanced recruitment of MTA1, p65RelA, and RNA polymerase II to the NF-κB consensus sites in the TG2 promoter. Interestingly, both the recruitment of p65 and TG2 expression are effectively blocked by a pharmacological inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway. These findings reveal an obligatory coregulatory role of MTA1 in the regulation of TG2 expression and of the MTA1-TG2 pathway, at least in part, in LPS modulation of the NF-κB signaling in stimulated macrophages.

Inflammation is an adaptive immune response triggered by the body against detrimental stimuli and conditions such as microbial infection and tissue injury (1Medzhitov R. Nature. 2008; 454: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (4038) Google Scholar, 2Takeuchi O. Akira S. Cell. 2010; 140: 805-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5868) Google Scholar). Inflammation is usually a healing response, but it becomes detrimental if targeted destruction and assisted repair are not properly activated (3Nathan C. Nature. 2002; 420: 846-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). Primarily, macrophages and mast cells recognize the infection and produce a wide variety of inflammatory mediators such as chemokines, cytokines, etc., all contributing to the elicitation of an inflammatory response (1Medzhitov R. Nature. 2008; 454: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (4038) Google Scholar). The inflammatory response is characterized by coordinated regulation of signaling pathways that regulate the expression of both the pro-inflammatory and the anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), etc. (4Lawrence T. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2009; 1: a001651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2969) Google Scholar). The inability of host to regulate inflammatory response results in sepsis, organ dysfunction, and even death (5Falasca L. Farrace M.G. Rinaldi A. Tuosto L. Melino G. Piacentini M. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 2616-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These inflammatory cytokines are under the tight control of master gene transcriptional factor NF-κB in promoting the inflammation, and in turn, innate immunity (6Mantovani A. Allavena P. Sica A. Balkwill F. Nature. 2008; 454: 436-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (8064) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transcriptional control of such NF-κB genomic targets is also under a tight control of nucleosome-remodeling coregulators and complexes, leading to either the stimulation or the repression of gene transcription at the molecular level (7El Gazzar M.

In recent times, metastatic tumor antigen 1 (MTA1) 3The abbreviations used are: MTA1, metastatic tumor antigen 1; TG2, transglutaminase 2; pol II, RNA polymerase II; qPCR, quantitative PCR; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast. has been recognized as one of the major coregulators in mammalian cells. MTA1 is a ubiquitously expressed chromatin modifier, having an integral role in nucleosome-remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complexes (11Manavathi B. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1529-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). MTA1 is widely up-regulated in a wide variety of human tumors and has been shown to play a role in tumorigenesis (11Manavathi B. Kumar R. J. Biol.

Wang R.A. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Semin. Oncol. 2003; 30: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). MTA1 regulates transcription of its targets by modifying the acetylation status of the target chromatin and cofactor accessibility to the target DNA. Recent work from this laboratory has shown that MTA1 plays a key role in inflammatory responses both as a target and as a component of the NF-κB signaling by regulating a subset of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory cytokines (8Pakala S.B. Bui-Nguyen T.M. Reddy S.D. Li D.Q. Peng S. Rayala S.K. Behringer R.R. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23590-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or by directly regulating the MyD88, a proximal component of NF-κB signaling (15Pakala S.B. Reddy S.D.

In addition to these functions, MTA1 also plays an essential role in Hepatitis B Virus X Protein stimulation of NF-κB signaling and in the expression of NF-κB target gene products with functions in inflammation and tumorigenesis (16Bui-Nguyen T.M. Pakala S.B. Sirigiri R.D. Xia W. Hung M.C. Sarin S.K. Kumar V. Slagle B.L. Kumar R. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, MTA1 is a newly added regulator of inflammation, and it is also regulated by a number of genes including transglutaminase 2 (TG2) (17Mehta K. Kumar A. Kim H.I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2010; 80: 1921-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). TG2 is a multifunctional enzyme involved in several cellular functions such as apoptosis (18Szondy Z. Sarang Z. Molnar P.

Physiol. 1991; 149: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Aberrant activation and functions of TG2 have been linked with a variety of inflammatory diseases that include celiac disease, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and sepsis (5Falasca L. Farrace M.G. Rinaldi A. Tuosto L. Melino G. Piacentini M. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 2616-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Facchiano F. Facchiano A. Facchiano A.M. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 1758-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Results from a mouse model system revealed that TG2 is also involved in the NF-κB activation, which induces the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, causing continuous activation of inflammatory process and contributing to the development of sepsis, whereas depletion of TG2 brings partial resistance to sepsis (5Falasca L. Farrace M.G. Rinaldi A. Tuosto L. Melino G. Piacentini M. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 2616-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Apart from its role in inflammation, elevated levels of TG2 are associated with many types of cancers (17Mehta K. Kumar A. Kim H.I. Biochem.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7194-7202Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), a property shared with MTA1. In addition to this, increased expression of TG2 in cancer cells leads to increased drug resistance, metastasis, and poor patient survival (23Mehta K. Fok J. Miller F.R. Koul D. Sahin A.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 8068-8076Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 24Verma A. Wang H. Manavathi B. Fok J.Y. Mann A.P. Kumar R. Mehta K.

Although TG2 expression parallels with MTA1 during inflammation, it remains unclear whether these molecules are trans-regulated by inflammation. Here we report that MTA1 is an obligatory coregulator of TG2 expression and that the MTA1-TG2 pathway plays a mechanistic role, at least in part, in bacterial LPS modulation of the NF-κB signaling in stimulated macrophages. All cells used in this study were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Raw264.7 and MCF7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, whereas HC11-pcDNA and HC11-MTA1, MTA1+/+, and MTA1−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have been described in our earlier studies (27Kumar R. Balasenthil S. Manavathi B. Rayala S.K. Pakala S.B. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 6649-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Transglutaminase 2 (catalogue number 3557) and NF-κB p65 (catalogue number sc-372) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Antibodies against MTA1 (catalogue number A300-280A) and RNA polymerase II (pol II) (catalogue number A300-653A) were purchased from Bethyl Laboratories, whereas normal mouse IgG, rabbit IgG, and antibodies against vinculin were from Sigma. Bacterial LPS was purchased from Sigma. Whenever needed, LPS was used at the concentration of 1 μg/ml of the medium. MTA1 siRNA (catalogue number, M-004127-01) and NF-κB p65 siRNA (catalogue number, sc-29411) were purchased from Dharmacon RNAi Technologies (Lafayette, CO) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. The microarray expression profiling and analysis were carried out as described elsewhere (28Li D.Q. Pakala S.B. Reddy S.D. Ohshiro K. Peng S.H. Lian Y. Fu S.W. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10044-10052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The RNA isolated by the TRIzol method was further checked for purity by analyzing on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). From the 2 μg of the total purified RNA, rRNA reduction was performed using RiboMinusTM transcriptome isolation kit (Invitrogen). Reduced rRNA was now labeled using the GeneChip WT cDNA synthesis/amplification kit and hybridized on a GeneChip Mouse Exon 1.0 ST array. Scanning of the hybridized arrays was carried out using Affymetrix GeneChip scanner 3000 7G. The obtained microarray data were analyzed using GeneSpring GX10.0.2. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed on statistically significant samples using GeneSpring GX10.0.2. For qPCR and RT-PCR analysis, the total RNA was isolated by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and first-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using 2 μg of total RNA and oligo(dT) primer. cDNA from macrophages was synthesized using the FastLane cell cDNA synthesis kit (Qiagen). qPCR and RT-PCR were performed using gene-specific primers listed in supplemental Table 1. qPCR analysis was carried out using a 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The levels of mRNA of all the genes were normalized to that of β-actin mRNA. Murine TG2 promoter was PCR-amplified from mouse genomic DNA and cloned into pGL3 basic vector using the In-Fusion 2.0 dry-down PCR cloning kit (Clontech). The PCR amplification was carried out using the primers listed in supplemental Table 2. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated as described elsewhere (8Pakala S.B. Bui-Nguyen T.M. Reddy S.D. Li D.Q.

After LPS treatment, peritoneal lavage was done with 10 ml of sterile ice-cold PBS, and the peritoneal lavage fluid was collected. The cells were washed and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, cultured overnight, and then washed to remove nonadherent cells. siRNA against MTA1 and negative control siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon. Raw or MCF-7 cells were seeded at 40% density in 6-well plates, the day before transfection, and siRNA transfections were performed with Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h of transfection, cells were harvested for Western blot analysis or used for either confocal or reporter assays. TG2 promoter assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega), and the results were normalized against the β-galactosidase activity, an internal control. Some assays were performed in the presence of control siRNA or MTA1 siRNA as described previously (8Pakala S.B. Bui-Nguyen T.M. Reddy S.D. Li D.Q. Peng S. Rayala S.K. Behringer R.R. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23590-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After transfecting the MCF-7 cells with MTA1 siRNA, MTA1 and TG2 expression was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. The cells were grown on sterile glass coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked in 10% normal goat serum in PBS. Cells were incubated with MTA1 and TG2 antibodies, washed three times in PBS, and then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated (TG2,goat anti-rabbit; MTA1, anti-mouse) with Alexa Fluor 488 (for TG2) and Alexa Fluor 555 (MTA1) from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The DAPI (Molecular Probes) was used as a nuclear stain. Microscopic analysis was performed using an Olympus FV300 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY) using sequential laser excitation to minimize fluorescence emission bleed-through. ChIP analysis using p65, MTA1, and RNA pol II antibodies and Western blotting were carried out following the methods described previously (8Pakala S.B. Bui-Nguyen T.M. Reddy S.D. Li D.Q. Peng S. Rayala S.K. Behringer R.R. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23590-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The primers used are listed in supplemental Table 3. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), nuclear extracts were prepared using a Nonidet P-40 lysis method (16Bui-Nguyen T.M. Pakala S.B. Sirigiri R.D. Xia W. Hung M.C. Sarin S.K. Kumar V. Slagle B.L. Kumar R. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). EMSA for NF-κB DNA binding was performed using the annealed and [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled oligonucleotides in a 20-μl reaction mixture for 15 min at 20 °C. Samples were run on a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel and imaged by autoradiography. Specific competitions were performed by adding a 100 m excess of competitor to the incubation mixture, and supershift EMSAs were performed by adding 1.5 μl of either the NF-κB p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology 286-H) or the TG2 (catalogue number 3557) or MTA1 antibodies. Oligonucleotides used were listed in supplemental Table 4. The results are given as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by using Student's t test. From an ongoing separate microarray analysis, we unexpectedly identified decreased expression of TG2 mRNA in MTA1−/− MEFs as compared with the wild-type MEFs (Fig. 1A). Further, we found that depletion of endogenous MTA1 also reduces the levels of TG2 mRNA and protein (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, MTA1 overexpression in MEFs and murine mammary HC11 cells resulted in a stimulated expression of the TG2 mRNA and protein (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that MTA1 affects TG2 expression. As MTA1 is positively regulated by the expression of TG2, we next tested this hypothesis by analyzing the levels of MTA1 and TG2 in a widely studied experimental model of breast cancer progression involving isogenic MCF-10A cells (nonmalignant), MCF-10AT cells (weakly tumorigenic cells), MCF-10CA1D cells (undifferentiated metastatic cells), and MCF-10DCIS cells (highly proliferative, aggressive, and invasive cells) (29Heppner G.H. Miller F.R. Shekhar P.M. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The levels of both MTA1 and TG2 were progressively up-regulated from noninvasive MCF10A to highly invasive MCF-10DCIS cells (Fig. 1E). In addition, MTA1 silencing in the MCF-7 cells also down-regulated the levels of TG2 mRNA (Fig. 1F) and protein (Fig. 1H). Effective knockdown of MTA1 protein in MCF-7 cells by MTA1 siRNA was shown in Fig. 1G. Taken together, these finding suggest that MTA1 regulates the expression of TG2. Aberrant TG2 expression and functions have been reported in inflammatory diseases and cancer (5Falasca L. Farrace M.G. Rinaldi A. Tuosto L. Melino G. Piacentini M. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 2616-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Facchiano F. Facchiano A. Facchiano A.M. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 1758-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Having previously demonstrated that MTA1, as a component of NF-κB signaling, is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses (8Pakala S.B. Bui-Nguyen T.M. Reddy S.D. Li D.Q. Peng S.

As LPS induces the expression of MTA1 in Raw264.7 macrophage (Raw) cells (8Pakala S.B. Bui-Nguyen T.M. Reddy S.D. Li D.Q. Peng S. Rayala S.K. Behringer R.R. Kumar R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2010; 285: 32787-32792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we assessed the levels of TG2 in LPS-stimulated Raw cells. We found that both MTA1 expression and TG2 expression were co-induced by LPS (Fig. 2A). Further, an experimental reduction in the endogenous MTA1 in the Raw cells by specific siRNA compromised the ability of LPS to induce the expression of TG2 mRNA (Fig. 2B). As results of siRNA-mediated knockdown studies are drawn by the extent of target knockdown, we next validated these findings in genetically MTA1-depleted MEFs and cultured peritoneal macrophages from wild-type and MTA1−/− mice (8Pakala S.B. Bui-Nguyen T.M. Reddy S.D. Li D.Q. Peng S. Rayala S.K. Behringer R.R. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23590-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and investigated the effect of LPS on TG2 expression. We found that MTA1 deficiency substantially compromised the ability of LPS to induce TG2 mRNA in MTA1−/− macrophages (Fig. 2C) and TG2 protein in MTA1−/− MEFs (Fig. 2D). These findings suggest that MTA1 is a required cellular coregulator for LPS induction of TG2. To understand the basis of MTA1 regulation of TG2, we cloned the TG2 promoter into a pGL3-basic-luciferase reporter system. We observed that LPS is a potent inducer of TG2 transcription and that reducing the levels of the endogenous MTA1 by MTA1 siRNA (Fig. 3A) and in MTA1−/− MEFs (Fig. 3B), compromised TG2 transcription as well as the ability of LPS to induce TG2 promoter activity. In addition, we observed an increased TG2 promoter activity upon MTA1 overexpression (Fig. 3C). These observations suggest that MTA1 regulates TG2 expression at the transcriptional level. To gain a deeper insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the noticed MTA1 regulation of TG2 expression, we carried out a detailed ChIP analysis in Raw cells treated with or without LPS and mapped the recruitment of MTA1 onto three regions of TG2 promoter at −320 to −491, −630 to −849, and −1878 to −2139 (Fig. 4, A and B). However, we only observed enhanced recruitment of MTA1 in response to LPS stimulation onto the −630 to −849 region of TG2 promoter (Fig. 4B), indicating a role for this region in LPS regulation of TG2. In addition, we noticed the recruitment of MTA1-pol II coactivator complex only to this region (−630 to −849) under basal as well as LPS stimulation. Together, these results suggest the involvement of MTA1 in regulating TG2 transcription by targeting a specific region of TG2 chromatin in LPS-stimulated macrophages.

Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar), we next focused on the mechanism of LPS regulation of TG2 expression. We found that parthenolide, a pharmacological inhibitor of NF-κB (31Kishida Y. Yoshikawa H. Myoui A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), attenuated both basal and LPS-stimulated TG2 protein, mRNA expression, and promoter activity (Fig. 5, A–C) in the Raw cells, suggesting that LPS may regulate TG2 expression via NF-κB signaling. In this context, transient expression of p65RelA increased the TG2 promoter activity in the basal as well as LPS-stimulated conditions in the Raw cells (Fig. 5D), whereas depletion of NF-κB p65 resulted in decreased TG2 transcription (Fig. 5E), suggesting that TG2 is an NF-κB target gene. To understand the molecular details of NF-κB regulation of TG2, we conducted a ChIP-based promoter walk with p65RelA antibody in the Raw cells with or without LPS treatment. We observed the recruitment of p65RelA onto the −630 to −839 region of the TG2 promoter, and this was further enhanced in the presence of LPS (Fig. 6A). We also observed that p65-MTA1 and p65-pol II complexes are also co-recruited to the same region of the TG2 chromatin (Fig. 6, A and B). Importantly, parthenolide effectively blocked the recruitment of p65RelA to this region of the TG2 promoter (Fig. 6C). To support these results, we showed that p65 could be coimmunoprecipitated along with MTA1 under both the basal and the LPS-stimulated Raw cells as evident by an increased association of p65 in LPS-stimulated cells as compared with the level in the control cells (Fig. 6D). Further, the interaction of MTA1 and p65 was also validated in vitro (Fig. 6E) using 35S-labeled MTA1 protein and glutathione S-transferase-NF-κB-p65 fusion protein. These results support the notion of a direct interaction of MTA1 with NF-κB-p65. Collectively, these results suggest that p65-MTA1-pol II may exist in the same complex under physiological condition. Scanning of the MTA1-targeted region of TG2 promoter (−630 to −839) for available transcriptional factors using the ALGGEN-PROMO software revealed the presence of only one potential NF-κB site (GGGAATTATC, −758 to −749). To demonstrate the direct binding of p65RelA to the TG2 promoter, we next performed an EMSA analysis using oligonucleotides encompassing this site (both wild-type and mutant NF-κB) using the nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated Raw cells (Fig. 6F). We found the appearance of a distinct protein-DNA complex in the LPS-stimulated condition (Fig. 6F, lane 3). The specificity of this protein-DNA complex was verified by supershift analysis using p65RelA or MTA1 antibodies. We noticed supershifts with p65 or MTA1 antibodies but not by the control IgG antibody (Fig. 6F, lanes 4–6). No protein-DNA complex was observed with the oligonucleotides having mutant NF-κB sequence (Fig. 6F, lanes 9–14). These results suggest that LPS stimulates TG2 transcription via direct recruitment of the p65-MTA1 complex onto the TG2 promoter and that TG2 is an NF-κB target. A schematic representation of recruitment of p65 and MTA1 to the TG2 promoter is shown in Fig. 6G. Together, these findings revealed an inherent role of MTA1 in the regulation of TG2 expression, which, at least in part, may constitute one of the mechanisms involved in the modulation of LPS-induced NF-κB signaling by MTA1 in stimulated macrophages (Fig. 7). In brief, our finding of MTA1 regulation of TG2 expression introduces a new regulatory player of NF-κB signaling during induction of proinflammatory cytokines and innate immunity. Several reports represented a positive correlation between the expression of NF-κB and TG2 expression (32Mann A.P. Verma A. Sethi G. Manavathi B. Wang H. Fok J.Y. Kunnumakkara A.B. Kumar R.

Increased TG2 activity triggers NF-κB activation by inducing the polymerization of I-κBα rather than stimulating I-κBα kinase (35Kim S.Y. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 3026-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This polymerization of I-κBα results in a direct activation of NF-κB, resulting in constitutive expression of various target genes involved in inflammation (5Falasca L. Farrace M.G. Rinaldi A. Tuosto L. Melino G. Piacentini M. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 2616-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 35Kim S.Y. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 3026-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). During sepsis mediated by LPS, NF-κB is activated, leading to the induction of cytokines and inflammatory mediators. The absence of TG2 could be an advantage during endotoxic shock because this deficiency appears to be associated with an activation of NF-κB that is transient, thus allowing the restoration of immunological equilibrium. In this context, studies from the TG2−/− knock-out mice revealed that TG2 offers a protection against liver injuries caused by CCl4 (36Nardacci R. Lo Iacono O. Ciccosanti F. Falasca L. Addesso M.

Rev. 2009; 89: 991-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Although many reports have shown an association between the levels of TG2 during inflammatory diseases, its regulation and its role in inflammatory process remain poorly understood. In this context, our present study demonstrates the involvement of MTA1 in the modulation of NF-κB signaling leading to TG2 transcription and proinflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated cells. These findings suggest that TG2 is a target of MTA1 and that its transcription is positively regulated by TG2 because of a direct binding of the MTA1, p65RelA, and pol II complex to the TG2 promoter (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 6). We propose that MTA1 offers protection against the invading pathogens either directly by regulating the strength of the NF-κB signaling and/or by regulating its target genes like TG2.

During phosphate shortage, plants replace phospholipids with GalGalDAG to rescue phosphate while maintaining membrane homeostasis. Here we investigate how the activity of the corresponding glycosyltransferase (GT) in Arabidopsis thaliana (atDGD2) depends on local bilayer properties by analyzing structural and activity features of recombinant protein. Fold recognition and sequence analyses revealed a two-domain GT-B monotopic structure, present in other plant and bacterial glycolipid GTs, such as the major chloroplast GalGalDAG GT atDGD1. Modeling led to the identification of catalytically important residues in the active site of atDGD2 by site-directed mutagenesis. The DGD synthases share unique bilayer interface segments containing conserved tryptophan residues that are crucial for activity and for membrane association. More detailed localization studies and liposome binding analyses indicate differentiated anchor and substrate-binding functions for these separated enzyme interface regions. Anionic phospholipids, but not curvature-increasing nonbilayer lipids, strongly stimulate enzyme activity. From our studies, we propose a model for bilayer ""control"" of enzyme activity, where two tryptophan segments act as interface anchor points to keep the substrate region close to the membrane surface. Binding of the acceptor substrate is achieved by interaction of positive charges in a surface cluster of lysines, arginines, and histidines with the surrounding anionic phospholipids. The diminishing phospholipid fraction during phosphate shortage stress will then set the new GalGalDAG/phospholipid balance by decreasing stimulation of atDGD2."

Here we show that a signal transduction pathway containing the Pkh1/Pkh2 protein kinases and one of their effector kinases, Pkc1, is required for and regulates global mRNA decay at the deadenylation step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Additionally, many stresses disrupt protein synthesis and release mRNAs from polysomes for incorporation into P-bodies for degradation or storage. We find that the Pkh1/2-Pkc1 pathway is also required for stress-induced P-body assembly.

Mammals may use similar regulatory mechanisms because components of the decay apparatus and signaling pathways are conserved. Messenger RNA decay is vital for control of eukaryotic gene expression and large-scale analyses suggest that as many as half of all changes in mRNA levels during stress are due to mRNA decay (1Fan J.

Progress in understanding the mechanisms of mRNA decay is notable, yet we still do not understand how global or basal decay is regulated or how decay and processing body (P-body) 3The abbreviations used are: P-bodies, processing bodies; pkhts, cells with the pkh1ts::URA and pkh2::NAT alleles; ypkts, cells with the ypk1-1ts::HIS3 ypk2-Δ1::TRP1 alleles; SGA, synthetic genetic array; PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1. formation are coupled to stresses and nutrients. In this work we identify a signal transduction pathway that regulates global mRNA decay and P-body formation during nutrient limitation. A well studied route of mRNA decay in eukaryotes, termed deadenylation-dependent decay, begins by shortening or deadenylation of the 3′ polyadenosine (poly(A)) tail, a rate-limiting step in mRNA decay (reviewed in Refs. 3Parker R. Sheth U. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 4Eulalio A. Behm-Ansmant I. Izaurralde E. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Deadenylation in mammals is also the initiating event in other mRNA decay pathways involving AU-rich elements, destabilizing elements in coding regions, nonsense codons, and micro-RNAs (3Parker R. Sheth U. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 4Eulalio A. Behm-Ansmant I. Izaurralde E. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Once a poly(A) tail is shortened, further degradation proceeds by removal of the 5′ N7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap from the mRNA (called “decapping”) followed by 5′-to-3′ exonuclease digestion by XrnI/KemI protein. Many mRNAs are degraded by this pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has played key roles in elucidating the mechanisms of eukaryotic mRNA decay (9Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a deadenylated transcript can be degraded in the 3′-to-5′ direction by the exosome (6He F. Li X. Spatrick P. Casillo R. Dong S. Jacobson A. Mol.

Deadenylation of most mRNAs in S. cerevisiae begins with removal of ∼20 bases from the poly(A) tail by the Pan2-Pan3 deadenylase (11Brown C.E. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6548-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), followed by the Ccr4-Pop2-Not (12Bai Y. Salvadore C. Chiang Y.C. Collart M.A. Liu H.Y. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which shortens the tail to around 10 bases at which point decapping occurs (14Denis C.L. Chen J. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 221-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Mammals also use this two-step deadenylation mechanism, which is likely to be conserved in most eukaryotes (15Yamashita A. Chang T.C. Yamashita Y. Zhu W. Zhong Z. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Decapping begins by binding of the Lsm1–7 complex to the partially deadenylated mRNA, followed by recruitment of the Dcp1/Dcp2 decapping enzyme whose activity is stimulated by the Dhh1 and Pat1 proteins (7Garneau N.L. Wilusz J. Wilusz C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 16Fillman C. Lykke-Andersen J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Decapping and 5′-to-3′ exonucleolytic degradation can occur on cytoplasmic foci termed P-bodies (10Coller J. Parker R. Annu.

Biol. 2007; 27: 3970-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Recently deadenylation, decapping, and 5′-to-3′ decay have been shown to also occur on translating mRNAs in yeast cells (23Hu W. Sweet T.J. Chamnongpol S. Baker K.E. Coller J. Nature. 2009; 461: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To survive nutrient depletion and other stresses, eukaryotes have evolved complex coping mechanisms including changes in the rate of global mRNA decay. Mammals respond to UV-B radiation, hydrogen peroxide, heat and high osmolarity by reducing the rate of mRNA decay at the deadenylation step (24Gowrishankar G. Winzen R. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Redich N. Kracht M. Holtmann H. Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae cells also reduce the rate of deadenylation in response to these stresses and to glucose withdrawal, a severe nutritional stress (25Teixeira D. Sheth U. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Brengues M. Parker R. RNA. 2005; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 26Hilgers V. Teixeira D. Parker R. RNA. 2006; 12: 1835-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Additionally, many stresses inhibit translation initiation and the mRNAs released from polysomes are sequestered into P-bodies (3Parker R. Sheth U. Mol.

P-bodies not only mediate mRNA decay, but studies in S. cerevisiae show that P-bodies repress translation and store mRNAs for reuse (28Brengues M. Teixeira D. Parker R. Science. 2005; 310: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). P-bodies or related structures called stress granules appear to perform similar functions in mammals (3Parker R. Sheth U. Mol.

We are interested in identifying new processes controlled by the Pkh1 and Pkh2 protein kinases in S. cerevisiae because of their roles in regulating growth and survival in response to nutritional cues and environmental stresses and because they are homologs of mammalian phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) (30Casamayor A.

Unexpectedly, global deadenylation and mRNA decay along with P-body assembly only require Pkh1/2-Pkc1 pathway activity when cells are growing on nutrient-poor medium, establishing a connection between nutrient availability and mRNA decay. Yeast strains and plasmids used in these studies are described under supplemental Tables S1 and 2. Cells were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or synthetic medium containing 2 or 4% glucose (SD) or 2% galactose and 1% sucrose (SG) plus 0.34% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 1% ammonium sulfate, 30 mg/liter of adenine sulfate, tryptophan, and tyrosine, and 20 mg/liter each of histidine, leucine, lysine, methionine, and uracil. Solid medium contained 2% agar. A nutrient-enriched version of SD medium contained all 20 amino acids, adenine, uracil, inositol, and para-aminobenzoic acid (36Coller J. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 448: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Experiments were based on published procedures (36Coller J. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 448: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 37Passos D.O. Parker R. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 448: 409-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 38Nissan T.

To shut-off transcription of reporter genes, cells were grown to an A600 nm of 0.3–0.4 in SG medium and GAL gene expression was repressed by centrifuging cells and suspending in SD (4% glucose) medium. Where indicated in the text, transcription was also shut-off by using thiolutin (4 or 8 μg/ml). RNA was isolated as previously described (36Coller J. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 448: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A total of 20 μg of RNA from each time point was separated by electrophoresis on a 1.4% agarose gel or 6% denaturing PAGE gel. Northern analysis was performed by using 32P-labeled 5′-end oligonucleotides (5′-AATTCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCA-3′, 5′-GCCCAATGCTGGTTTAGAGACGATGATAGCATTTTCTAGCTCAGCATCAGTGATCTTAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCATACCTCTACCACCGGGGTGCTTTCTGTGCTTACCG-3′ as the probes to detect MFA2pG, GAL1-L, and CYH2 mRNAs, respectively. Blots were stripped and reprobed using a 32P-labeled 5′-end oligonucleotides (5′-GTCTAGCCGCGAGGAAGG-3′) complementary to the SCR1 RNA, which served as a loading control for each lane. For experiments involving a temperature shift, cells were grown at 25 °C, switched to 39 °C, and transcription was shut-off after 30, 60, or 120 min as indicated in the figures. Radioactive signals on Northern blots were quantified by using a PhosphorImager and mRNA half-lives were calculated from mRNA signals normalized to the SCR1 signal. The role of Pkh1/2 and Pkc1 in P-body assembly was examined in the strains listed in the figure legends. Cells grown to an A600 nm of 0.3–0.4 in SD-Leu-Ura medium at 25 °C were switched to 39 °C for various times before inducing P-body formation by glucose starvation, which involved washing cells once by centrifugation and suspending in S medium lacking glucose for 10 min followed immediately by fluorescent microscopy. To induce hypotonic stress, cells were grown in SD-Leu-Ura medium, washed with and then suspended in water for 10 min, and examined by fluorescent microscopy. To induce hypertonic stress, cells were washed with and suspended in medium containing 1 m KCl for 15 min. Microscopy was performed with a Nikon ECLIPSE E600 equipped with a PLAN APO ×100, 1.40 oil immersion objective. Room temperature samples were photographed with a SPOT RT 9.0 Monochrome-6 camera using the MetaMorph (version 6.3.0) acquisition software. Images were processed by using Adobe Photoshop (7.0). Protein synthesis was measured using a slightly modified version of a published procedure (39Ashe M.P. De Long S.K. Sachs A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 25 °C to an A600 nm of 0.4 in SD medium, shifted to 39 °C, and at 0, 10, 30, and 60 min, triplicate 1-ml samples were incubated for 5 min at 39 °C with 2 μl of a radioactive solution containing [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (EXPRESS35S35S Protein Labeling Mix, NEG0700, 1150 Ci/mmol, New England Biolabs). Protein synthesis was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 20% cold TCA to each reaction and further sample processing was as described previously (39Ashe M.P. De Long S.K. Sachs A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). SGA analyses were performed as previously described (40Tong A.H. Boone C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 171-192PubMed Google Scholar). Thiolutin (Enzo Life Science International) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 1 mg/ml and used at a concentration of 4 or 8 μg/ml. To use the SGA method as a way to find new processes regulated by Pkh1/2 we constructed a query strain, RCD587 (pkh1ts::URA3 pkh2::NAT), carrying a temperature-sensitive pkh1 allele and a pkh2 deletion allele, because deletion of both genes is lethal (30Casamayor A. Torrance P.D. Kobayashi T. Thorner J. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 186-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Crossing this strain to the set of 4,700 viable yeast deletion mutants (35Tong A.H. Lesage G. Bader G.D. Ding H. Xu H. Xin X. Young J. Berriz G.F. Brost R.L. Chang M. Chen Y. Cheng X. Chua G.

This group contained strains mutated in genes with known roles in processes controlled by Pkh1/2 thereby validating the screen. For example, Pkh1/2 phosphorylate Pkc1, which regulates cell wall biosynthesis (31Inagaki M. Schmelzle T. Yamaguchi K. Irie K. Hall M.N. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell.

Our screen identified genes including ROM2, SLT2, SMI1, and BCK1 encoding components of this pathway and FKS1, GAS1, GAS4, GAS5, LAS21, YUR1, RIM21, and OST6 that encode proteins necessary for cell wall functions. A novel and unanticipated synthetic slow growing strain carried the dhh1Δ mutation. Dhh1 is a DEXD/H-box helicase that stimulates mRNA decapping, represses translation, and functions in P-body formation (27Coller J. Parker R. Cell. 2005; 122: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 45Coller J.M. Tucker M. Sheth U. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Parker R.

Thomas C.B. Enomoto S. Berman J. Chang T.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4995-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A weaker synthetic slow growth interaction occurred with the KEM1/XRN1 gene, responsible for the 5′ to 3′ degradation of decapped mRNAs (48Parker R. Song H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). These data suggested that Pkh1/2 have a role in mRNA decay. To verify the DHH1 interaction, the pkh1ts pkh2Δ query strain (referred to as pkhts) was transformed with a CEN vector carrying PKH1 under control of the GAL1 promoter to make PKH1 expression galactose-inducible and glucose-repressible. DHH1 was deleted in these cells to produce pkh1ts pkh2Δ dhh1::KAN (pGAL1-PKH1) cells whose growth was more impaired at 30 °C than either parent or wild-type cells when GAL1-PKH1 expression was repressed by glucose (Fig. 1A, compare the 30 °C Glu and Gal panels), thus, validating the slow-growth phenotype found in the SGA assay. To determine whether Pkh1/2 regulates mRNA decay, we measured the half-life (t½) of the MFA2pG reporter mRNA by Northern blotting (49Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In these and subsequent experiments, transcription of the plasmid-borne GAL1-MFA2pG gene was activated by growing cells in the presence of galactose and shutoff by adding glucose to the culture medium. In pkhts mutant cells (pkh1ts pkh2Δ) grown at 25 °C the MFA2pG mRNA had a average t½ of 4.4 min, similar to the average t½ of 4.9 min in wild-type cells (Fig. 1B, 0 min time point). In pkhts cells the rate of decay became slower the longer the cells were at the restrictive temperature of 39 °C so that after 30 min of incubation the t½ was 6.7 min and after 120 min it was >30 min (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the t½ did not change in wild-type cells over this time course. The longer t½ in pkhts cells is due to reduced Pkh activity because the wild-type t½ is nearly restored when the PKH2 gene is returned to mutant cells on a single-copy plasmid (Fig. 1B). These results show that Pkh1/2 regulate MFA2pG mRNA decay. To determine whether the behavior of the MFA2pG mRNA in pkhts cells is representative of global mRNA decay, two endogenous mRNAs were examined. The GAL1 mRNA had an average t½ of 8.4 min in wild-type cells at time 0 and this value did not change during 2 h of incubation at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 1C). In pkhts cells the average t½ was 8 min at time 0 but slowed to 13.9 min following 30 min incubation at 39 °C and continued to decrease to about 26 min after 2 h. The same trends were seen with the CYH2 mRNA with the t½ remaining relatively constant in wild-type cells (average of about 8.5 min) and becoming longer in pkhts cells during the 2-h incubation at 39 °C (Fig. 1D). For both of these endogenous mRNAs the slowing of the decay rate in pkhts cells was prevented by supplying PKH2. The t½ values in wild-type cells are similar to published values (9Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 50Zuk D. Jacobson A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2914-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We conclude from these data that global mRNA decay requires functional Pkh1/2. Deadenylation and decapping are highly regulated steps in mRNA decay (3Parker R. Sheth U. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 5Goldstrohm A.C. Wickens M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Cell. 2008; 32: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). To determine whether Pkh1/2 regulate either step we analyzed a portion of the RNA samples used to generate the data shown in Fig. 1 by using high-resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (9Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 53Schwartz D.C. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5247-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Under these conditions most of the poly(A) tail on MFA2pG mRNA in wild-type cells was hydrolyzed within 8 min or at the rate of about 8 adenosines (A)/min, a rate that remained constant over 2 h (Fig. 2A). Mutant pkhts cells had a similar rate of deadenylation at time 0, but after 30 min at 39 °C the rate dropped to 5.5 A/min and continued to drop over the course of the experiment to a rate of 1.3 A after 2 h. Returning PKH2 to mutant cells restored a normal rate of deadenylation. Similar affects on the rate of deadenylation of endogenous GAL1 mRNA were observed (Fig. 2B). We conclude from these data that Pkh1/2 are required for and regulate the deadenylation step in mRNA decay. Because most functions of Pkh1/2 are mediated by downstream protein kinases Pkc1, Ypk1/2, and Sch9, we determined if any of these kinases control mRNA decay. Analysis of sch9Δ and ypk1ts ypk2Δ mutant cells indicated that Sch9 and Ypk1/2 are not required for mRNA decay (supplemental Fig. S1). Because PKC1 is an essential gene, we examined mRNA decay in a strain with a temperature-sensitive pkc1 allele (54Drgonová J. Drgon T. Roh D.H. Cabib E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 373-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using procedures similar to those used with pkhts cells except that pkc1ts cells were incubated at the restrictive temperature of 39 °C for 1 h only before mRNA decay was examined. This shorter incubation time was necessary to avoid cell lysis, which occurs at longer incubation times because the Pkc1 pathway is the master regulator of cell wall maintenance and repair (55Levin D.E. Bartlett-Heubusch E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We verified experimentally that less than 20% of the cells lysed after 60 min at 39 °C. The half-life of MFA2pG mRNA in pkc1ts cells shifted to the restrictive temperature was 14.2 min, or about 2-fold slower than the 6.4-min half-life observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 3A). The affect of Pkc1 on deadenylation was analyzed by subjecting a portion of RNA to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which revealed that the reduced rate of decay was due to impaired deadenylation in pkc1ts cells and not to impaired decapping or hydrolysis of the mRNA body in the 5′ to 3′ direction by the XrnI exonuclease (Fig. 3B). For example, in wild-type cells the poly(A) tails were degraded at an average rate of 8.3 A/min, whereas in pkc1ts cells they were degraded at an average rate of 3.8 A/min. Our data are consistent with Pkc1 acting downstream of Pkh1/2 to regulate deadenylation. But to directly verify this hypothesis we sought to show that a constitutively active PKC1 allele (54Drgonová J. Drgon T. Roh D.H. Cabib E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 373-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) would bypass impaired deadenylation in pkhts mutant cells because such an allele would not require active Pkh. In pkhts mutant cells grown for 1 h at a restrictive temperature the t½ of MFA2pG mRNA was 11.5 min or a little over twice as long as the 4.5 min t½ observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 3C). Mutant cells carrying the constitutive PKC1 allele on a CEN vector had a t½ for MFA2pG mRNA of 7.5 min, showing that the rate of decay was partially restored to the wild-type rate. Likewise, the constitutive PKC1 allele partially restored the rate of deadenylation (Fig. 3D). Partial restoration of the decay and deadenylation rates is expected because cells have both wild-type and constitutive Pkc1 activity. Based upon our data for mRNA decay and deadenylation in pkc1ts cells we conclude that Pkc1 activity is required for and regulates the deadenylation step of the mRNA decay pathway. We determined if the Pkh1/2-Pkc1 pathway controls P-body assembly because the mechanism for controlling their assembly is not known. The Dcp2 subunit of the decapping enzyme, having the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to its C terminus, served as a visual reporter for P-body formation (17Sheth U. Parker R. Science. 2003; 300: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The pkhts cells were grown at 25 °C, switched to 39 °C for various times, starved 10 min for glucose to induce P-body formation, and examined by fluorescent microscopy. Before the temperature shift (time 0), one or two large P-bodies appeared in wild-type,"

Finlay B.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In this perspective, signaling cascades triggered through pattern recognition receptors signify as critical events regulating the activity of macrophages in terms of cytokine or chemokine production, receptor expression, and directed migration to secondary lymphoid organs for subsequent antigen presentation (2Kawai T. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2009; 21: 317-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). These attributes often have a major influence in determining the overall strength of the immune response.

Despite relevance in regard to regulation of inflammatory responses or local immune homeostasis, the NOD2 contribution to adaptive immunity remains to be elucidated. Albeit a integral component of bacterial peptidoglycan, MDP, a well characterized ligand for NOD2, is known for its adjuvant properties; interestingly, unlike many TLR agonists, its engagement with NOD2 receptor preferentially drives Th2 skewed immune responses, which are generally associated with the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype of macrophages (5Butler M.

Thus because of its wide implications, our aim is to understand the nature of the molecular signaling events that control the NOD2-triggered immune responses. Notch signaling effectuates important roles not only in the development of the immune system, but also critically in cell fate judgments among fully differentiated immune cells including macrophages or dendritic cells (11Fung E.

The Notch pathway is characterized by juxtacrine ligand-receptor interactions between adjacent cells, and macrophages are known to express Notch ligands as well as receptors, thus possessing the capacity to both induce and respond to Notch signals. Upon productive engagement of Notch receptor with its cognate ligand-like Jagged1 on cell membrane of adjacent macrophages, the γ-secretase complex generates release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD/Cleaved Notch) by proteolytic processing from the cell membrane. NICD upon translocation to the nucleus binds and complexes with CSL/RBP-Jk, a DNA-binding protein that normally associates with Notch target gene promoters along with several co-repressors. This results in coordinated recruitment of transcriptional co-activators like mastermind, p300, and/or CBP (CREB-binding protein) with simultaneous displacement of co-repressors, leading to CSL/RBP-Jk-dependent transcription of target genes (15Bray S.J.

However, the importance of the functional significance of Notch signaling in cytosolic immune surveillance mediated by NLR-like NOD2 remains unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate a potential role for NOD2 in activating Notch1 signaling by virtue of directed regulation of Jagged1 expression in macrophages. Importantly, signaling perturbations or genetic approaches implicated a critical role of cross-talk among members of Notch1-phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in NOD2-mediated anti-inflammatory immune responses, including the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and IL-10, in macrophages. Correlative evidence demonstrates that this mechanism operates in vivo as MDP, a known NOD2 agonist, triggered the expression of activated Notch1, Jagged1, or its target gene COX-2 in brain or splenocytes of mice. Importantly, we demonstrate that the NOD2-driven activation of the Notch1-PI3K signaling cascade is instrumental in protection of macrophages against TNF-α or IFN-γ-triggered apoptosis. Briefly, the current investigation identifies a novel role for Notch1 signaling in orchestrating functional attributes of NOD2 activation in an immunological milieu as well as in modulation of a distinct set of innate immunological parameters including COX-2 in innate immune cells. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from peritoneal exudates of C57BL/6 or iNOS−/− C57BL/6 mice maintained at the central animal facility, Indian Institute of Science. The RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cell line was cultivated in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Sigma). All studies involving macrophages were performed utilizing mice peritoneal macrophages with the exception of transfection experiments, which were performed on RAW 264.7 macrophages. Mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were generated as described previously (21Lutz M.B. Kukutsch N. Ogilvie A.L. Rössner S. Koch F. Romani N. Schuler G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 223: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). All studies were carried out with approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee for animal experimentation as well as from the Institutional Biosafety Committee. General laboratory chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Merck. Lipopolysaccharide-free MDP was procured from Sigma. Anti-β-actin, anti-iNOS, and anti-PGE2 antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Anti-COX-2 and anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen were purchased from Calbiochem. HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. The anti-Thr70 phospho-eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1), anti-4EBP1, anti-Thr180/Tyr182 phospho-p38 MAPK, anti-p38 MAPK, anti-Thr202/Tyr204 phospho-ERK1/2, anti-ERK1/2, anti-NF-κB p65, anti-cleaved Notch1 or anti-NICD (Val1744), anti-Tyr458 p85/Tyr199 p55 phospho-PI3K, anti-p85 PI3K, anti-Jagged1, anti-βII Ser660 phospho-PKC, anti-Ser176 phospho-RIP2, anti-Tyr416 Src, anti-Src, and anti-Ser412 phospho-TAK1 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. All pharmacological reagents were obtained from Calbiochem and were reconstituted in sterile DMSO (Sigma) and used at concentrations detailed under supplemental Table S1. 1% DMSO was used as the vehicle control. In all experiments with inhibitors, a tested concentration was used after careful titration experiments assessing the viability of the macrophages using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. In experiments with inhibitors, the cells were treated with a given inhibitor for 60 min before experimental treatment. Nitric oxide donor, SIN-1 (Sigma), was used at concentration of 20 μm. Total RNA from treated macrophages was isolated by the TRIzol method (Sigma) as per the manufacturer's protocol, and treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega). The cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas) was used for reverse transcription according to the manufacturer's protocol. A real time PCR amplification (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green PCR mix (Finnzymes, Finland) was performed for quantification of target gene expression. All reactions were repeated at least three times independently to ensure the reproducibility of the results. Amplification of the GAPDH housekeeping gene was used as internal control. Primer sequences used in the current study are detailed in supplemental Table S2. Cells were washed with PBS and scrapped off the culture dish and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml of each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and incubated on ice for 30 min. Whole cell lysate was collected by centrifuging lysed cells at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal protein amounts from each cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore) by semidry Western blotting (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk powder in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 60 min. The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in TBST with 5% BSA. After washing with TBST, blots were incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP for 2 h. After further washing in TBST, the immunoblots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions. RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with 100 nm siRNA using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency was more than 50% throughout the experiments as determined by counting the number of siGLO Lamin A/C positive cells in a microscopic field using a fluorescent microscope. 72 h post-transfection the cells were treated as indicated and processed for expression analysis. All siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon as siGENOMETM SMARTpool reagents, which contains a pool of four different double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides (siRNA). RAW 264.7 macrophages were transiently transfected with AKT or p85 dominant-negative (D/N) cDNA constructs using low Mr polyethylenimine (Sigma). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were carried out as described previously (22Bansal K. Narayana Y. Patil S.A. Balaji K.N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2009; 85: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Peritoneal macrophages were left untreated or treated as indicated for 6 h. The cells were fixed with 1.42% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature followed by inactivation of formaldehyde with addition of 125 mm glycine. Chromatin extracts containing DNA fragments with an average size of 500 bp were immunoprecipitated using anti-NF-κB or anti-NICD antibodies for NF-κB and RBP-Jk ChIP, respectively. Purified DNA was analyzed by quantitative PCR using the SYBR Green method (Finnzymes). Regions with NF-κB and RBP-Jk binding sites in the mouse COX-2 promoter were amplified using primer pairs, NF-κB forward, 5′-ttaaccggtagctgtgtgcgt-3′, reverse, 5′-tctccggtttcctcccagt-3′; and RBP-Jk forward, 5′-tcccgtgaaaagagttgctga-3′, reverse, 5′-ttcatggaactaccctccgg-3′. 28S rRNA was used as control in the PCR and the primers were forward, 5′-ctgggtataggggcgaaagac-3′ and reverse, 5′-ggccccaagacctctaatcat-3′. All results were normalized either by the respective input values or by amplification of 28S rRNA. All ChIP experiments were repeated at least three times. C57BL/6 or iNOS−/− C57BL/6 mice utilized in the current investigation were 5–6 weeks old and each in vivo experiment involved three animals per group. For intracranial or intravenous challenge, 5 μg of MDP or 20 μg of SIN-1 were resuspended in 50 μl of sterile PBS and then inoculated using 1-ml syringes and a 26-gauge needle. Control mice were injected with 50 μl of sterile PBS using the same protocol. Before intracranial inoculation, mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of 80 μl of ketamine (6 mg). Experimental mice were sacrificed after 3 or 6 days of inoculations in the case of intravenous and intracranial inoculation, respectively, and splenocytes or brain tissues were harvested. Microtome sections (4 μm) were cut from formalin-fixed, decalcified, and paraffin-embedded tissue samples. These paraffin-embedded sections were first deparafinized, followed by antigen retrieval with boiling 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a microwave for 10 min, treated with 1% H2O2 for 10 min, incubated with 0.1 m glycine for 15 min, and blocked with 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 90 min. The horseradish peroxidase reaction was detected with 0.05% diaminobenzidine and 0.03% H2O2. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. Stained tissue sections were analyzed with a Leica DMLB microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). All experiments were performed with appropriate isotype-matched control antibodies. Macrophages were harvested by centrifugation and gently resuspended in ice-cold Buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF). After incubation on ice for 15 min, cell membranes were disrupted with 10% Nonidet P-40, and the nuclear pellets were recovered by centrifugation 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants from this step were used as cytosolic extracts. Nuclear pellets were lysed with ice-cold Buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF) and nuclear extracts were collected after centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Enzyme immunoassays for quantitation of PGE2 were carried out in 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc) utilizing the culture supernatant of treated samples. Culture supernatants were incubated in assay plates overnight at 4 °C followed by three washes with PBS. After blocking with 1% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C, wells were incubated with anti-PGE2 antibodies for 6 h at 37 °C followed by washing with PBS. The plates were further incubated with HRP-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h at 37 °C followed by development with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. The absorbance was measured at 492 nm using an ELISA reader (Molecular Devices). Enzyme immunoassay for IL-10 in cell-free culture supernatants was carried out using the IL-10 ELISA kit (Peprotech Asia, Israel) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, assay plates were coated with anti-IL-10 capture antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with 1% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washes with PBST (0.05% Tween 20), plates were incubated with cell-free culture supernatants for 2 h followed by three washes with PBST and incubation with anti-IL-10 detection antibodies for 2 h at 37 °C. The plates were further incubated with streptavidin-HRP antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C followed by development with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. The absorbance was measured in an ELISA reader (Molecular Devices) at 492 nm. 1.5 × 103 macrophages/well were seeded in a 96-well plate. After 12 h of plating, the cells were treated as indicated followed by addition of MTT (20 μl of 5 mg/ml) 3 h prior to completion of the experiment. MTT is a tetrazolium salt that is converted by living cells into blue formazan crystals. The cell-free supernatant was removed from the wells 3 h after MTT addition and 200 μl of DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan crystals and the absorbance was measured at 550 nm in an ELISA reader (Molecular Devices). Levels of significance for comparison between samples were determined by Student's t test. The data in the graphs are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Graphpad Prism 3.0 software (Graphpad Software) was used for all statistical analysis. NOD2 receptor-mediated signaling could elicit a spectrum of cellular immune responses that constitute cytosolic innate immune surveillance, including the production of multifaceted effector PGE2, a product of inducible COX-2 enzymatic activity (23Maeda S. Hsu L.C. Liu H. Bankston L.A. Iimura M. Kagnoff M.F. Eckmann L. Karin M. Science. 2005; 307: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Herein, we show that engagement of the NOD2 receptor by its cognate ligand MDP culminates in the robust activation of Notch1 signaling as evidenced by induced formation of the cleavage product of Notch1 (NICD) (Fig. 1A). Importantly, MDP induced Jagged1 expression, a Notch1 receptor ligand, is critical for the NOD2-driven Notch1 signaling (Fig. 1B). As a “proof of concept,” NOD2 engagement resulted in the activation of effector kinases downstream of NOD2, including RIP2 and TAK1, in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). To assess the importance of NOD2 and RIP2 in activation of Notch1 signaling, expression levels of NICD and Jagged1 expression were quantified in the presence of the pharmacological inhibitor of RIP2, PP2. Although PP2 is known to inhibit Src family protein kinases, it has been recently reported that it inhibits RIP2 more potently (24Windheim M. Lang C. Peggie M. Plater L.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, utilized concentrations of PP2 failed to inhibit phorbol myristate acetate-triggered activation of Src in primary macrophages (supplemental Fig. S1A). In addition, we could not detect activation of Src upon stimulation of NOD2, ruling out any possibility of a nonspecific effect of PP2 on Src family kinases (supplemental Fig. S1B). In this regard, inhibition of the RIP2 kinase by PP2 abrogated the MDP driven activation of Notch1 signaling as quantified by NICD formation, Jagged1 expression, and expression analysis of Notch1 signaling target genes, COX-2 and Hes1 (Fig. 1, D and E, data not shown). Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of NOD2, RIP2, or TAK1 severely compromised the NOD2-driven expression of NICD, Jagged1, or COX-2 (Fig. 1, F and G, and supplemental Fig. S2, A–C). From bioinformatic analysis, we identified six CSL/RBP-Jk and five NF-κB-binding consensus in mouse COX-2 promoter (25Bansal K. Kapoor N. Narayana Y. Puzo G. Gilleron M. Balaji K.N. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1H, NOD2 engagement results in enhanced recruitment of CSL/RBP-Jk or NICD and NF-κB to COX-2 promoter signifying the involvement of the Notch1-driven signaling events upon NOD2 stimulation. Concomitantly, signaling perturbations with the Notch1 activation inhibitor, γ-secretase inhibitor I (GSI-I), as well as siRNA-mediated knockdown of Notch1 or CSL/RBP-Jk clearly established the involvement of Notch1 in NOD2-triggered expression of Notch1 target genes COX-2 or Hes1 (Fig. 1, I and J, and supplemental Fig. S2D, data not shown). Furthermore, stable expression of NICD in RAW 264.7 macrophages resulted in augmented expression of Notch1 target genes Hes1 or COX-2 (data not shown) (22Bansal K. Narayana Y. Patil S.A. Balaji K.N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2009; 85: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, recent studies have suggested that MDP as a NOD2 agonist has the potential to drive Th2 responses in dendritic cells (5Butler M. Chaudhary R. van Heel D. Playford R. Ghosh S. J. Crohns Colitis. 2007; 1: 106-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 6Magalhaes J.G. Fritz J.H. Le Bourhis L. Sellge G. Travassos L.H. Selvanantham T. Girardin S.E. Gommerman J.L. Philpott D.J. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 7925-7935Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when analyzed, activation of the NOD2 receptor by its cognate ligand MDP resulted in induced formation of NICD, expression of Jagged1, and a concomitant increase in expression of the Notch1 target gene COX-2 in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (supplemental Fig. S3A). Importantly, pretreatment of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells with the RIP2 kinase inhibitor abolished the NOD2-triggered activation of Notch1 signaling (supplemental Fig. S3A). These findings strongly implicate a critical positive role for Notch1-mediated CSL/RBP-Jk recruitment in the NOD2-driven anti-inflammatory immune responses in macrophages as well as dendritic cells. Notch-specific genetic signatures are critical not only in the development of innate immunity, but also in imparting survival benefits to a wide range of cell types (26Beverly L.J. Felsher D.W. Capobianco A.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7159-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Sade H. Krishna S. Sarin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2937-2944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In this perspective, Notch1 signaling-mediated survival effects frequently necessitate participation of members of the PI3K pathway (27Sade H. Krishna S. Sarin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2937-2944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 28Gutierrez A. Look A.T. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 411-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Importantly, delineation of the mechanisms involved in NOD2-driven activation of the PI3K pathway, if any, remains obscure. To elucidate the involvement of NOD2 in PI3K signaling activation, macrophages were pulsed with MDP and as shown in Fig. 2A, NOD2 engagement triggered phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K, 4EBP1, an important member of the PI3K pathway. As described, stimulation of NOD2 resulted in activation of RIP2 and TAK1 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). In this perspective, to investigate the role for RIP2 kinase, NOD2-mediated activation of the PI3K pathway was assessed upon pre-treatment of macrophages with the pharmacological inhibitor PP2. As demonstrated, inhibition of the RIP2 kinase by PP2 abrogated the NOD2-driven activation of PI3K as quantified by phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K or 4EBP1 (Fig. 2B). Extensive cross-talk among members of the Notch1 and PI3K signaling cascades in terms of genetic interactions, physical association between specific members, or association to complex comprising unique cofactors have been documented (22Bansal K. Narayana Y. Patil S.A. Balaji K.N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2009; 85: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Bansal K. Kapoor N. Narayana Y. Puzo G. Gilleron M. Balaji K.N.

Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 411-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this regard, blockade of Notch1 signaling activation by GSI-I resulted in marked inhibition of NOD2-driven activation of PI3K (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, in concurrence with these results, inhibition of PI3K by the p85 dominant-negative construct or pharmacological inhibitor LY294002 and wortmannin; AKT by the dominant-negative construct or AKT inhibitor; and mTOR by rapamycin significantly attenuated NOD2-triggered Notch1-PI3K-mediated COX-2 expression (Fig. 2, D and E).

https://openalex.org/W2050017111,"The serine-protease OMI/HTRA2, required for several cellular processes, including mitochondrial function, autophagy, chaperone activity, and apoptosis, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Western blot quantification of OMI/HTRA2 in frontal cortex of patients with AD (n=10) and control subjects (n=10) in two separate materials indicated reduced processed (active, 35 kDa) OMI/HTRA2 levels, whereas unprocessed (50 kDa) enzyme levels were not significantly different between the groups. Interestingly, the specific protease activity of OMI/HTRA2 was found to be significantly increased in patients with AD (n=10) compared to matched control subjects (n=10) in frontal cortex in two separate materials. Comparison of OMI/HTRA2 mRNA levels in frontal cortex and hippocampus, two brain areas particularly affected by AD, indicated similar levels in patients with AD (n=10) and matched control subjects (n=10). In addition, we analyzed the occurrence of the OMI/HTRA2 variants A141S and G399S in Swedish case-control materials for AD and PD and found a weak association of A141S with AD, but not with PD. In conclusion, our genetic, histological, and biochemical findings give further support to an involvement of OMI/HTRA2 in the pathology of AD; however, further studies are needed to clarify the role of this gene in neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2056744621,"The nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1, NR5A1) is a key regulator of adrenal and gonadal biology. Disruption of SF-1 can lead to disorders of adrenal development, while increased SF-1 dosage has been associated with adrenocortical tumorigenesis. We aimed to identify a novel subset of SF-1 target genes in the adrenal by using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) microarrays (ChIP-on-chip) combined with systems analysis. SF-1 ChIP-on-chip was performed in NCI-H295R human adrenocortical cells using promoter tiling arrays, leading to the identification of 445 gene loci where SF-1-binding regions were located from 10 kb upstream to 3 kb downstream of a transcriptional start. Network analysis of genes identified as putative SF-1 targets revealed enrichment for angiogenic process networks. A 1.1-kb SF-1-binding region was identified in the angiopoietin 2 (Ang2, ANGPT2) promoter in a highly repetitive region, and SF-1-dependent activation was confirmed in luciferase assays. Angiogenesis is paramount in adrenal development and tumorigenesis, but until now a direct link between SF-1 and vascular remodeling has not been established. We have identified Ang2 as a potentially important novel target of SF-1 in the adrenal gland, indicating that regulation of angiogenesis might be an important additional mechanism by which SF-1 exerts its actions in the adrenal gland."

https://openalex.org/W1964496833,"Mammalian pre-mRNA alternative splicing mechanisms are typically studied using artificial minigenes in cultured cells, conditions that may not accurately reflect the physiological context of either the pre-mRNA or the splicing machinery. Here, we describe a strategy to investigate splicing of normal endogenous full-length pre-mRNAs under physiological conditions in live mice. This approach employs antisense vivo-morpholinos (vMOs) to mask cis-regulatory sequences or to disrupt splicing factor expression, allowing functional evaluation of splicing regulation in vivo. We applied this strategy to gain mechanistic insight into alternative splicing events involving exons 2 and 16 (E2 and E16) that control the structure and function of cytoskeletal protein 4.1R. In several mouse tissues, inclusion of E16 was substantially inhibited by interfering with a splicing enhancer mechanism using a target protector morpholino that blocked Fox2-dependent splicing enhancers in intron 16 or a splice-blocking morpholino that disrupted Fox2 expression directly. For E2, alternative 3'-splice site choice is coordinated with upstream promoter use across a long 5'-intron such that E1A splices almost exclusively to the distal acceptor (E2dis). vMOs were used to test the in vivo relevance of a deep intron element previously proposed to determine use of E2dis via a two-step intrasplicing model. Two independent vMOs designed against this intronic regulatory element inhibited intrasplicing, robustly switching E1A splicing to the proximal acceptor (E2prox). This finding strongly supports the in vivo physiological relevance of intrasplicing. vMOs represent a powerful tool for alternative splicing studies in vivo and may facilitate exploration of alternative splicing networks in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2009707610,"C to T mutation hotspots in skin cancers occur primarily at methylated CpG sites that coincide with sites of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) formation. These mutations are proposed to arise from the insertion of A by DNA polymerase η opposite the T that results from deamination of the methylC ((m)C) within the CPD. Although the frequency of CPD formation and repair is modestly modulated by its rotational position within a nucleosome, the effect of position on the rate of (m)C deamination in a CPD has not been previously studied. We now report that deamination of a T(m)C CPD whose sugar phosphate backbone is positioned against the histone core surface decreases by a factor of 4.7, whereas that of a T(m)C CPD positioned away from the surface increases by a factor of 8.9 when compared with unbound DNA. Because the (m)Cs undergoing deamination are in similar steric environments, the difference in rate appears to be a consequence of a difference in the flexibility and compression of the two sites due to DNA bending. Considering that formation of the CPD positioned away from the surface is also enhanced by a factor of two, a T(m)CG site in this position might be expected to have up to an 84-fold higher probability of resulting in a UV-induced (m)C to T mutation than one positioned against the surface. These results indicate that rotational position may play an important role in the formation of UV-induced C to T mutation hotspots, as well as in the mutagenic mechanism of other DNA lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2077828343,"GluA1 (formerly GluR1) AMPA receptor subunit phosphorylation at Ser-831 is an early biochemical marker for long-term potentiation and learning. This site is a substrate for Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase C (PKC). By directing PKC to GluA1, A-kinase anchoring protein 79 (AKAP79) facilitates Ser-831 phosphorylation and makes PKC a more potent regulator of GluA1 than CaMKII. PKC and CaM bind to residues 31–52 of AKAP79 in a competitive manner. Here, we demonstrate that common CaMKII inhibitors alter PKC and CaM interactions with AKAP79(31–52). Most notably, the classical CaMKII inhibitors KN-93 and KN-62 potently enhanced the association of CaM to AKAP79(31–52) in the absence (apoCaM) but not the presence of Ca2+. In contrast, apoCaM association to AKAP79(31–52) was unaffected by the control compound KN-92 or a mechanistically distinct CaMKII inhibitor (CaMKIINtide). In vitro studies demonstrated that KN-62 and KN-93, but not the other compounds, led to apoCaM-dependent displacement of PKC from AKAP79(31–52). In the absence of CaMKII activation, complementary cellular studies revealed that KN-62 and KN-93, but not KN-92 or CaMKIINtide, inhibited PKC-mediated phosphorylation of GluA1 in hippocampal neurons as well as AKAP79-dependent PKC-mediated augmentation of recombinant GluA1 currents. Buffering cellular CaM attenuated the ability of KN-62 and KN-93 to inhibit AKAP79-anchored PKC regulation of GluA1. Therefore, by favoring apoCaM binding to AKAP79, KN-62 and KN-93 derail the ability of AKAP79 to efficiently recruit PKC for regulation of GluA1.

https://openalex.org/W2027633770,"Background The non-receptor tyrosine kinases c-Abl and c-Src are overexpressed in various solid human tumours. Inhibition of their hyperactivity represents a molecular rationale in the combat of cancerous diseases. Here we examined the effects of a new family of pyrazolo [3,4-d] pyrimidines on a panel of 11 different murine lung tumour progenitor cell lines, that express stem cell markers, as well as on the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 and the human colon cancer cell line CaCo2 to obtain insight into the mode of action of these experimental drugs. Methodology/Principal Findings Treatment with the dual kinase inhibitors blocked c-Abl and c-Src kinase activity efficiently in the nanomolar range, induced apoptosis, reduced cell viability and caused cell cycle arrest predominantly at G0/G1 phase while western blot analysis confirmed repressed protein expression of c-Abl and c-Src as well as the interacting partners p38 mitogen activated protein kinase, heterogenous ribonucleoprotein K, cyclin dependent kinase 1 and further proteins that are crucial for tumour progression. Importantly, a significant repression of the epidermal growth factor receptor was observed while whole genome gene expression analysis evidenced regulation of many cell cycle regulated genes as well integrin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signalling to impact cytoskeleton dynamics, migration, invasion and metastasis. Conclusions/Significance Our experiments and recently published in vivo engraftment studies with various tumour cell lines revealed the dual kinase inhibitors to be efficient in their antitumour activity."
https://openalex.org/W2038046746,"Myf5 is a myogenic regulatory factor that functions in myogenesis. An intronic microRNA, miR-In300, located within zebrafish myf5 intron I, has been reported to silence myf5 through the targeting of dickkopf-3-related gene (dkk3r). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the control of myf5 expression by dkk3r is unknown. By injecting dkk3r-specific morpholino-oligonucleotide (dkk3r-MO) to knock down Dkk3r, we found that the phosphorylated p38a protein was reduced. Knockdown of p38a resulted in malformed somites and reduced myf5 transcripts, which photocopied the defects induced by injection of dkk3r-MO. To block the MAPK pathway, phosphorylation of p38 was inhibited by introduction of SB203580, which caused the down-regulation of myf5 expression. The GFP signal was dramatically decreased in somites when we injected p38a-MO into embryos derived from transgenic line Tg(myf5(80K):GFP), in which the GFP was driven by the myf5 promoter. Although these p38a-MO-induced defects were rescued by co-injection with p38a mRNA, they were not rescued with p38a mRNA containing a mutation at the phosphorylation domain. Moreover, overexpression of Smad2 or Smad3a enhanced myf5 expression, but the defects induced by the dominant negative form of either Smad2 or Smad3a equaled those of embryos injected with either dkk3r-MO or p38a-MO. These results support the involvement of Smad2·Smad3a in p38a mediation. Overexpression of Smad4 enabled the rescue of myf5 defects in the dkk3r-MO-injected embryos, but knockdown of either dkk3r or p38a caused Smad4 protein to lose stability. Therefore, we concluded that Dkk3r regulates p38a phosphorylation to maintain Smad4 stability, in turn enabling the Smad2·Smad3a·Smad4 complex to form and activate the myf5 promoter.

In vertebrates, the determination and differentiation of trunk skeletal muscle is controlled by the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors, such as Myf5, Myod, myogenin, and MRF4 (1Pownall M.E. Gustafsson M.K. Emerson Jr., C.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 747-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Myf5 is the first myogenic regulatory factor expressed in mammals (2Buckingham M. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 144-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), birds (3Hacker A.

Genesis. 2001; 29: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) during early embryogenesis in a somite- and stage-specific manner. In zebrafish, myf5 is primarily detectable in the somites and segmental plates (5Chen Y.H. Lee W.C. Liu C.F. Tsai H.J. Genesis. 2001; 29: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 6Coutelle O. Blagden C.S. Hampson R. Halai C. Rigby P.W. Hughes S.M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The transcription level of myf5 elevates substantially until 16 hpf, 2The abbreviations used are hpf, hours postfertilization; MO, morpholino-oligonucleotide; DN, dominant negative; PSM, presomitic mesoderm; WISH, whole mount in situ hybridization. gradually declines to undetectable levels by 33 hpf, and is strictly repressed after somitogenesis (5Chen Y.H. Lee W.C. Liu C.F. Tsai H.J. Genesis. 2001; 29: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Lin et al. (7Lin C.Y. Chen Y.H. Lee H.C. Tsai H.J. Gene. 2004; 334: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) had previously reported a strong, negative regulatory motif located at +502/+835 (I300) within the first intron of zebrafish myf5, having an orientation-dependent function. However, after further investigation, Hsu et al. (8Hsu R.J. Lin C.Y. Hoi H.S. Zheng S.K. Lin C.C. Tsai H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 4384-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) discovered a novel microRNA, named miR-In300, located at +609/+622, which binds to the 3′-UTR of the mRNA of the long isoform dickkopf-3 (dkk3), also named dickkopf-3-related gene (dkk3r). Knockdown of dkk3r with dkk3r-specific morpholino-oligonucleotide (dkk3r-MO) resulted in the down-regulation of myf5 expression, suggesting that Dkk3r is involved in the upstream positive regulation of myf5. Therefore, miR-In300 inhibits the translation of dkk3r mRNA, which, in turn, suppresses myf5 expression. To advance these findings in this study, we asked what molecular mechanism(s) might underlie the modulation of myf5 expression by dkk3r. Dkk is a secretory protein encompassing two conserved cysteine-rich regions, Cys-1 and Cys-2, located at the C and N terminus, respectively, but gapped by non-conserved linkers of various lengths (9Glinka A. Wu W. Delius H. Monaghan A.P. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Nature. 1998; 391: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar, 10Krupnik V.E. Sharp J.D. Jiang C. Robison K. Chickering T.W. Amaravadi L. Brown D.E. Guyot D. Mays G. Leiby K. Chang B. Duong T. Goodearl A.D. Gearing D.P. Sokol S.Y. McCarthy S.A. Gene. 1999; 238: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, the Dkk family is categorized as Dkk1 (AF116852), Dkk2, Dkk3 (NM_001089545.1), and Dkk3r (also named long isoform Dkk3; NM_001159283.1). The activation of myf5 gene expression by a secretory protein, such as Dkk3r, depends on intermediate molecules to transduce the signals. It has been reported that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is the most likely regulatory pathway involved in muscular development (11Keren A. Tamir Y. Bengal E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 252: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). There are two forms of p38 MAPK (p38) in zebrafish: p38a and p38b (12Krens S.F. He S. Spaink H.P. Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2006; 6: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Analysis of amino acid sequences showed that zebrafish p38a and p38b share identity with human and mouse/rat p38α of 86 and 84%, respectively, compared with identity of 69 and 66% in the sequences of p38β. This fact indicates that zebrafish p38a and p38b are two isoforms of p38α. Knock-out of p38α, -β, -γ, and -δ in mouse studies showed that only p38α knock-out resulted in myogenesis defects (13Perdiguero E. Ruiz-Bonilla V. Gresh L. Hui L. Ballestar E. Sousa-Victor P. Baeza-Raja B. Jardí M. Bosch-Comas A. Esteller M. Caelles C. Serrano A.L. Wagner E.F. Muñoz-Cánoves P. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The results indicate that p38α may play its most important role in the regulation of myogenesis. This is important in the context of the present study because zebrafish p38a and p38b may conserve the biological function of mouse p38α. Therefore, to understand how dkk3r controls myf5 expression in zebrafish, the p38a pathway was first examined in this study because the temporospatial expression of the p38a isoform, not the p38b isoform, totally corresponds with muscle development. Members of the TGF-β superfamily play a conserved function from Drosophila to higher mammals during embryogenesis. Mothers against Decapentaplegic (Mad)-related proteins (Smads) have been reported to play a role as cytoplasmic transducers in TGF-β signaling (14Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar, 15Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar, 16Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kretzschmar M. Massagué J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The activated receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), such as Smad1, -2, -3, -5, and -8, enter into nuclei to initiate the transcription of downstream genes (19Descargues P. Sil A.K. Sano Y. Korchynskyi O. Han G. Owens P. Wang X.J. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 2487-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Levy L. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8108-8825Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). R-Smads are required to form a complex with co-mediator Smads (Co-Smads), such as Smad4, which carries the activated R-Smads to nuclei. The binding of Co-Smad·R-Smads to promoters activates the expression of downstream genes. Smad complexes enter the nucleus to mediate TGF-β signal transduction, and the interaction between p38a and Smads has been reported in many cell lines (21Dziembowska M. Danilkiewicz M. Wesolowska A. Zupanska A. Chouaib S. Kaminska B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Watanabe H. de Caestecker M.P. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14466-14473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In addition, because Dkk3 is required for TGF-β signaling in Xenopus mesoderm induction (23Pinho S. Niehrs C. Differentiation. 2007; 75: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and because TGF-β family members are known to regulate myogenesis (24Meriane M. Charrasse S. Comunale F. Gauthier-Rouvière C. Biol. Cell. 2002; 94: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we examined the role of Smads in Dkk3 regulation of Myf5, taking the position that Dkk3r may activate the myf5 promoter through the signal transduction of p38 and the cytoplasmic transducer Smads. The following procedures were performed according to Lin et al. (25Lin C.Y. Chen W.T. Lee H.C. Yang P.H. Yang H.J. Tsai H.J. Dev. Biol. 2009; 331: 152-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar): the synthesis of capped mRNAs, the labeling of probes for WISH, and the observation of embryos under fluorescent microscopy. The following procedures were performed according to Hsu et al. (8Hsu R.J. Lin C.Y. Hoi H.S. Zheng S.K. Lin C.C. Tsai H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 4384-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar): the analysis of total proteins from embryos, Western blotting, and the quantitative measurement of luciferase activity. Embryos were placed in a 50-ml tube for 4.5 h prior to the subject stages. The tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min for heat induction. After embryos were removed from Embryo Medium (Zebrafish Book protocol) kept at room temperature, we placed the embryos at 28 °C and incubated them for 4 h. Finally, embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight, and chorions were removed. The ChIP assay was performed in vivo according to the protocols described by Lindeman et al. (26Lindeman L.C. Vogt-Kielland L.T. Aleström P. Collas P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 567: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), using the ExactaCruzTM IP/WB Reagents kit (Santa Cruz), except that (a) zebrafish embryos were injected with His-tagged expression plasmid, such as pHis-smad2, pHis-smad3a, or pHis-smad4; (b) A-agarose beads blocked with sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Upstate Biotechnology) were used; (c) the chromatin solution was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-His antibody; and (d) PCR primers specific for detection of myf5 promoter were used. Wobble p38a (wp38a) forward primer (CATGTCACAAAAGGAGAGGCCTACCTTCTA) and p38a reverse primer (GTGGATGAAATGGAGTCTTGA) were used to amplify a wp38a, which is not bound by p38a-MO, from zebrafish 16 hpf cDNA. The fragment of wp38a was ligated to the pGEM-T (Promega) and then ligated to EcoRI-cut pCS2 to generate pCS2-wp38a. The wp38a mRNA was synthesized with the SP6 promoter. To mutate the p38a phosphorylation site from Thr-Gly-Tyr (TGY) to Asn-Gly-Phe (NGF), we used a set of forward primer (GGATTCATGTCGCAGAAAGAA) and reverse mutated primer (GTGGCCACAA- ACCCATTCATCTCATC) as well as a set of forward mutated primer (GATGAGAT- GAATGGGTTTGTGGCCAC) and reverse primer (GTGGATGAAATGGAGTCTTGA) to amplify the mutated phosphorylation site of p38a (DN-p38a). The amplified product was ligated to pGEM-T and then ligated to EcoRI-cut pCS2. Primer sets of XhoI-smad2 forward primer (CTCGAGATGTCCTCCATCTTGCCTTTC) and Smad2 reverse primer (TTAGGACATACTGGAGCAGCG); XhoI-Smad3a forward primer (CTCGAGATGTCAATTTTACCTTTCACTC) and Smad3a reverse primer (CTATGACACACTGGAGCAGCG); XhoI-Smad3b forward primer (CTCGAGATGTCTATATTGCCTTTCACG) and Smad3b reverse primer (CTATGACACGCTGGAGCAGCG); and XhoI-Smad4 forward primer (CTCGAGATGTCCATCACAAACACTCCCA) and Smad4 reverse primer (TCAGTCTAACGGTGTGGGGTCT) were used to amplify the PCR products of Smad2, Smad3a, Smad3b, and Smad4, respectively, from zebrafish 16 hpf cDNA. With XhoI-smad2 or XhoI-smad3a forward primer and reverse primer, smad2 or -3a was amplified with PCR and ligated into pGEM-T. With XhoI and EcoRI, smad2 or smad3a was cut out and ligated to pRSETa. pRSETa-smad2 or -smad3a was transformed to BL-21 for the expression of His tag-Smad2 or His tag-Smad3 recombinant protein. From constructed pCS2-DN-p38a, the kdnp38a sequence was amplified with SalI-Kozak p38 forward primer (GTCGACGCCACCATGTCGCAGAAAGAAA) and p38a reverse primer using PCR. The amplified products were ligated to pGEM-T. The kdnp38a sequence, which was cut out with SalI and NotI, was ligated to SalI/NotI-treated pHSP70/4-EGFP to generate plasmid pHSP70/4-dnp38a. With pXT7-dnsmad2, -dnsmad3a, and -dnsmad3b (32Jia S. Ren Z. Li X. Zheng Y. Meng A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2418-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as templates, respectively, SalI-Kozak smad2 forward primer (GTCGACGCCACCATGTCCTCCATCTTGCC) and NotI-dnsmad2 reverse primer (CGCCGGCGTTAGGCCATAGCGGAGCAGCG); SalI-Kozak smad3a forward primer (GTCGACGCCACCATGTCAATTTTACCTTTC) and NotI-dnsmad3a reverse primer (CGCCGGCGCTATGCCACAGCGGAGCAGCG); and SalI-Kozak smad3b forward primer (GTCGACGCCACCATGTCTATATTGCCTTTC) and NotI- dnsmad3b reverse primer (GCCGGCGCTATGCCACGGCGGAGCAGCG) were used for PCR amplification of SalI-Kozak dnsmad-NotI. The amplified products were ligated to pGEM-T, and the kdnp38a was cut with SalI and NotI. The cut-out kdnsmad2/3a/3b fragments were ligated to SalI/NotI-treated pHSP70/4-EGFP to generate pHSP70/4-dnsmad2/3a/3b. dkk3r-MO was microinjected into one-cell stage zebrafish embryos, which were developed to 16 hpf and collected. Total protein of these embryos was extracted to perform Western blotting, and the amount of p38a protein level was detected. Compared with the protein level extracted from the control MO-injected embryos (Fig. 1C), the amount of p38a protein remained unchanged in the dkk3r-MO-injected embryos, but the amount of the phosphorylated p38a was reduced (Fig. 1C). Meanwhile, both the amount of p38a and the amount of phosphorylated p38a were reduced in the p38a-MO-injected embryos (Fig. 1C). To investigate whether the other ERK MAPK is involved, we injected dkk3r-MO to observe the amount of phosphorylated ERK protein. The results showed that inhibition of Dkk3r did not affect the phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 1D). This ruled out the involvement of Dkk3r in the ERK MAPK regulatory pathway. However, because the Dkk family is known to be the downstream regulator in Wnt signal transduction, we further tested for the involvement of zebrafish development through Wnt signal transduction. After injection of dkk3r-MO, the protein amounts of Wnt downstream phospho-ERK, β-catenin, and c-Myc were subjected to examination, and results showed that Dkk3r knockdown had no effect on either p-ERK, β-catenin, or Myc proteins (Fig. 1D), indicating that Dkk3r did not regulate muscle development through Wnt signal transduction. Thus, we suggested that Dkk3r might activate the phosphorylation of p38a to regulate myf5 gene expression, which, in turn, might affect muscle development. RT-PCR was performed to observe the temporal expression of p38a mRNA. At various developmental stages, p38a mRNA was expressed consistently from one-cell stage to the completion of muscle development at 30 hpf (supplemental Fig. S1A). WISH was performed to observe the temporospatial expression of p38a mRNA. At 7 hpf, p38a transcript was uniformly expressed in the whole embryonic body (supplemental Fig. S1B). At 18 hpf, p38a mRNA was expressed in eye, brain, and somites (supplemental Fig. S1C), and p38a was continuously expressed in somites at 24 hpf (supplemental Fig. S1D). At 36 hpf, when trunk muscle development was completed, the expression of p38a was reduced (supplemental Fig. S1E). These results showed that the temporospatial expression of p38a mRNA corresponded to trunk muscle development. To observe the effect of p38a on muscle development, p38a-MO was injected into one-celled fertilized eggs derived from the transgenic line Tg(α-actin:RFP), a muscle-specific red fluorescent transgenic line, and we found that the body axis of embryos changed from straight line (supplemental Fig. S2A) to tail-crooked (supplemental Fig. S2B). Observation of red fluorescence showed that somites did not present a normal V-shape (supplemental Fig. S2A′). Instead, somites presented an abnormal U-shape (supplemental Fig. S2B′), suggesting that p38a affects muscle development in zebrafish embryos. To investigate whether p38a is involved in the regulation of somitic myf5 expression, we injected embryos with p38a-MO to specifically inhibit the translation of p38a. These embryos were then subjected to WISH to examine the expression of myf5 at 16 hpf. In the wild-type (WT) embryos, myf5 was expressed in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and five somites from −II, −I, 0, 1, to 2, among which −II, −I, and 0 somites showed a more intensive signal. Although myf5 was more strongly expressed in the forming somites, its intensity decreased toward the anterior (Fig. 2A). However, in the p38a-MO-injected embryos, myf5 was expressed normally in PSM, but the expressional intensity decreased in somites. In −II forming somites, which typically had the strongest expression in WT, only low myf5 expression was shown in the p38a-MO-injected embryos (Fig. 2B). In addition, the somites in the p38a-MO-injected embryos became abnormally straight (Fig. 2B). All of the somites expressed myod in WT embryos (Fig. 2E) and p38a-MO-injected embryos (Fig. 2F). Moreover, neither the WT embryos nor the p38a-MO-injected embryos showed much difference in myogenin expression (Fig. 2, I and J). When p38a mRNA was synthesized and injected into zebrafish embryos to perform the rescue experiment, mRNA bound with p38a-MO and diluted the efficiency of p38a-MO because unmodified p38a was used. Therefore, we designed a wobble p38a (wp38a) mRNA, in which 7 nucleotides were mismatched to p38a-MO (supplemental Fig. S3). This allowed the rescue experiment to be performed without the translational inhibition effect of p38a-MO binding to wp38a mRNA, finally resulting in the down-regulation of myf5 expression. We also noticed that somites were normally formed on the basis of myod expression pattern (Fig. 2, E and F). This line of evidence showed that the effect of p38a-MO on myf5 mRNA expression was specific, not an off-target effect. To investigate the possible effect of p38a phosphorylation on the activation of myf5 expression, the p38a phosphorylation domain TGY was mutated to NGF, a domain that could not be phosphorylated. This dominant negative form, wobble p38a (DN-p38a), competed with normal p38a to block the signal transduction of p38a phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. S3). The injection of DN-wp38a mRNA with p38a-MO showed that the mutation of the p38a phosphorylation domain did not rescue myf5 (Fig. 2D) expressional defects in somites induced by p38a-MO (Fig. 2B). Specifically, myf5 expression decreased, the expression location was disordered, and myf5 expression in PSM was decreased (Fig. 2D). However, somites were normally formed on the basis of myod expression pattern (Fig. 2, G and H). Compared with the uninjected embryos derived from the transgenic line Tg(myf5(80K):GFP) in which GFP was driven by an upstream 80-kb segment of zebrafish myf5 (27Chen Y.H. Wang Y.H. Chang M.Y. Lin C.Y. Weng C.W. Westerfield M. Tsai H.J. BMC Dev. Biol. 2007; 7: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), embryos with p38a-MO injection showed a great decrease in GFP expression. On the other hand, co-injection of p38a-MO with wp38a mRNA restored GFP expression to a level similar to the control group (data not shown). When p38a-MO and DN-wp38a mRNA were co-injected into Tg(myf5(80K):GFP) embryos, DN-p38a mRNA did not rescue the GFP decrease caused by p38a-MO (data not shown). These results suggest that the phosphorylation of p38a may play an important role in myf5 expression. To further confirm the effects of p38a phosphorylation on myf5 expression, SB203580 was used to inhibit p38a phosphorylation and block the MAPK pathway (28Gum R.J. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Wang Z.

With 250–300 μm SB203580, somitic myf5 expression was decreased, but with 400–500 μm SB203580, 60–70% of embryos showed complete suppression of myf5 expression (supplemental Fig. S4). To further understand the relationship between Smads and the downstream activation of the zebrafish myf5 promoter, we performed WISH on 16-hpf embryos to observe the spatial relationship between smad mRNA and myf5 mRNA expressions. At 16 hpf, myf5 was expressed in tail PSM and six somites from −II to 3 in WT (supplemental Fig. S5A). smad2 was expressed in the whole embryonic body, with stronger expression in eyes, brain, and tail (supplemental Fig. S5B). smad3a was expressed weakly in the whole embryonic body, but smad3a was noticeably expressed in eyes, tail epithelium, new somites, and PSM (supplemental Fig. S5C). smad3b expressed in the whole embryonic body but with stronger expression in eyes and tail (supplemental Fig. S5D). smad4 was also expressed in the whole embryonic body but more strongly in eyes, brain, and tail somites (supplemental Fig. S5E).

The SXS motif at the C terminus of Smad2·Smad3 is mutated to AXA; therefore, neither Smad2 nor Smad3 is able to bind to TGF-β type I receptor (28Gum R.J. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Wang Z. Bower M.J.

In this study, we generated dominant negative forms of Smad2 (DN-Smad2), Smad3a (DN-Smad3a), and Smad3b (DN- Smad3b), which were mutated at P445H, S465A, and S467A (32Jia S. Ren Z. Li X. Zheng Y. Meng A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2418-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), respectively, from inducible plasmids pHSP70/4-dnsmad2, pHSP70/4-dnsmad3a, and pHSP70/4-dnsmad3b, respectively, after heat shock induction. In addition, because the Pro445 of Smad2·Smad3 was mutated to His445, Smad2·Smad3 was not able to attract Smad4 for the formation of a complex (33Hoodless P.A. Tsukazaki T. Nishimatsu S. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 364-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These three plasmids were injected into zebrafish embryos, and the embryos were heat-induced at 12.5 hpf for 30 min to produce DN-Smad2, DN-Smad3a, and DN-Smad3b. Embryos were then collected at 16 hpf for WISH experiments with myf5 and myod riboprobes. At 16 hpf, myf5 was expressed at 5 somites from −II to 2, with stronger expression at −II, −I, and 0 somites (Fig. 3B). With DN-Smad2 (Fig. 3D), DN-Smad3a (Fig. 3E), and DN-Smad3b (Fig. 3F) competing with endogenous corresponding Smads, 36, 44, and 18%, respectively, of embryos showed a decrease in myf5 expression, with three weak signals. Based on the myod expression pattern, we determined that somites were normally formed. Furthermore, we also injected another inducible plasmid, pHSP70/4-dnp38a, into embryos, and we obtained results similar to those based on the injection of pHSP70/4-dnsmad2/3a/3b, except that 74% of embryos exhibited a decrease in myf5 expression after competition between DN-p38a and endogenous p38a (Fig. 3C). Therefore, we concluded that overexpression of DN-Smads causes the down-regulation of myf5, a finding that further motivated us to ask whether Smad2·Smad3a can directly bind to the upstream region of myf5 to activate its promoter activity. To further study the effect of Smad2, Smad3a, and Smad3b on myf5 promoter activity, we co-injected either smad2 or smad3 mRNA with pZMYF6.3R, an upstream 6.3-kb segment of myf5 fused with the Renilla luciferase gene, into zebrafish embryos to measure the ability of Smad2 and Smad3 to activate the myf5 promoter. Compared with the luciferase activity driven by pZMYF6.3R, results showed that the addition of 350 pg of smad2 mRNA increased myf5 promoter activity 3-fold (supplemental Fig. S6). Because the -fold increase in activity rose when the concentration of smad2 mRNA increased, we concluded that the activation effect of Smad2 on the myf5 promoter was dosage-dependent (supplemental Fig. S6). Although the addition of 50 pg of smad3a mRNA increased myf5 promoter activity 2-fold (supplemental Fig. S6), the addition of either 50 pg of smad3b mRNA or 300 pg of smad4 mRNA did not elevate the activity of the myf5 promoter (supplemental Fig. S6). Simultaneously adding 30 pg of smad2, 20 pg of smad3a, and 100 pg of smad4 mRNA increased myf5 promoter activity 2.5-fold (supplemental Fig. S6). This evidence indicated that the activation of myf5 promoter by Smad2 and Smad3a required the recruitment of Smad4. To further investigate whether the effects of Smad2, Smad3a, and Smad4 are directly or indirectly involved in myf5 promoter activity, we employed the PROMO software (21Dziembowska M. Danilkiewicz M. Wesolowska A. Zupanska A. Chouaib S. Kaminska B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) to search for the potential binding sites in the upstream 3-kb segment of zebrafish myf5 gene (supplemental Fig. S7). The results showed that there were two potential Smad-binding elements (SBEs), which are known to be Smad3/4 binding sites, located at −1156/−1146 (SBE1) and −258/−248 (SBE2). Adjacent to these sites, there were also binding sites for potential Smad cofactors, such as PEBP2, AP-1, and CAATT-binding factor (supplemental Fig. S7) (22Watanabe H. de Caestecker M.P. Yamada Y.

https://openalex.org/W2045266743,"Geographic range limits and the factors structuring them are of great interest to biologists, in part because of concerns about how global change may shift range boundaries. However, scientists lack strong mechanistic understanding of the factors that set geographic range limits in empirical systems, especially in animals.Across dozens of populations spread over six degrees of latitude in the American Midwest, female mating success of the evergreen bagworm Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis (Lepidoptera: Psychidae) declines from ∼100% to ∼0% near the edge of the species range. When coupled with additional latitudinal declines in fecundity and in egg and pupal survivorship, a spatial gradient of bagworm reproductive success emerges. This gradient is associated with a progressive decline in local abundance and an increased risk of local population extinction, up to a latitudinal threshold where extremely low female fitness meshes spatially with the species' geographic range boundary.The reduction in fitness of female bagworms near the geographic range limit, which concords with the abundant centre hypothesis from biogeography, provides a concrete, empirical example of how an Allee effect (increased pre-reproductive mortality of females in sparsely populated areas) may interact with other demographic factors to induce a geographic range limit."
https://openalex.org/W2136529945,"Sca-1 (stem cell antigen-1) is a member of the Ly-6 family of proteins and regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and self-renewal in multiple tissues. In skeletal muscle, Sca-1 inhibits both proliferation and differentiation of myogenic cells. Sca-1 expression is dynamically regulated during muscle regeneration, and mice lacking Sca-1 display increased fibrosis following muscle injury. Here, we show that Sca-1 expression is negatively regulated by TGF-β1 and that this inhibition is dependent on Smad3. We demonstrate that levels of TGF-β1 in skeletal muscle rapidly increase on injury and that the majority of this TGFβ1 is produced by infiltrating macrophages. Sca-1 is expressed in multiple cell types, and we demonstrate that TGF-β1 represses Sca-1 expression in T cells and other immune cell populations derived from the spleen, indicating that regulation byTGF-β1 is a general feature of Sca-1 expression in multiple cell types. Elucidation of the mechanisms by which Sca-1 expression is regulated may aid in the understanding of muscle homeostasis, potentially identifying novel therapeutic targets for muscle diseases.—Long, K., Montano, M., Pavlath, G.

https://openalex.org/W2019691875,"Given the importance of G-protein-coupled receptors as pharmacological targets in medicine, efforts directed at understanding the molecular mechanism by which pharmacological compounds regulate their presence at the cell surface is of paramount importance. In this context, using confocal microscopy and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, we have investigated internalization and intracellular trafficking of the cholecystokinin-2 receptor (CCK2R) in response to both natural and synthetic ligands with different pharmacological features. We found that CCK and gastrin, which are full agonists on CCK2R-induced inositol phosphate production, rapidly and abundantly stimulate internalization. Internalized CCK2R did not rapidly recycle to plasma membrane but instead was directed to late endosomes/lysosomes. CCK2R endocytosis involves clathrin-coated pits and dynamin and high affinity and prolonged binding of β-arrestin1 or -2. Partial agonists and antagonists on CCK2R-induced inositol phosphate formation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation did not stimulate CCK2R internalization or β-arrestin recruitment to the CCK2R but blocked full agonist-induced internalization and β-arrestin recruitment. The extreme C-terminal region of the CCK2R (and more precisely phosphorylatable residues Ser437-Xaa438-Thr439-Thr440-Xaa441-Ser442-Thr443) were critical for β-arrestin recruitment. However, this region and β-arrestins were dispensable for CCK2R internalization.

As a general hallmark, GPCRs 3The abbreviations used are GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; CCK, cholecystokinin; CCK1R and CCK2R, cholecystokinin-1 and -2 receptor, respectively; Nle, norleucine; Rluc, Renilla luciferase; FRT, Flp recombination target; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; DN, dominant negative; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast. are tightly regulated at the cell surface both acutely and over a long time period. This regulation is thought to be critical to the physiological homeostasis of GPCR signaling, which can be disrupted in pathological states and is strongly affected by acute or repeated administration of clinically relevant drugs. Ligand-induced endocytosis is a general and important mechanism contributing to such GPCR regulation (1Hanyaloglu A.C. von Zastrow M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 537-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). For many GPCRs, the initial step of ligand-induced internalization, also named “desensitization,” involves receptor phosphorylation by GPCR kinases that selectively phosphorylate agonist-activated receptors. Phosphorylation of the receptor and subsequent binding of nonvisual arrestins prevent subsequent interaction of receptors with G-proteins, thus terminating the G-protein-mediated signal. Arrestin-bound receptors are rapidly targeted to the clathrin-coated pits, thereby promoting internalization of receptors (1Hanyaloglu A.C. von Zastrow M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 537-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 2Traub L.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 583-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 3Marchese A. Paing M.M.

Alternative mechanisms to those involving recruitment of β-arrestin adaptor and receptor targeting to clathrin-coated pits have been shown to govern internalization of some GPCRs (4Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mayor S. Pagano R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Following internalization, receptors may be sorted to different vesicular traffic routes, such as, for example, rapid recycling to the cell plasma membrane or slow recycling and degradation into lysosomes. Recently, it has been recognized that, in addition to its role in down-regulation of G-protein-mediated signal and cell responsiveness, internalization through β-arrestin recruitment represents a means for GPCRs to trigger signaling pathways independently of G-protein coupling (6von Zastrow M. Sorkin A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 7Sorkin A. Von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 600-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Importantly, pharmacological agents, named “biased ligands” or “functionally selective ligands,” have been discovered, which activate differentially G-protein-dependent and arrestin-dependent signaling pathways (8Rajagopal S. Rajagopal K. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The cholecystokinin-2 receptor (CCK2R), previously named the CCKB/gastrin receptor, belongs to family I of GPCRs, which includes rhodopsin (9Wank S.A. Pisegna J.R. de Weerth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Its natural ligands are cholecystokinin and gastrin, two structurally related neuropeptides, which bind the CCK2R with the same high affinity. The CCK2R is expressed in the central nervous system and in the gut, where it represents the predominant CCK receptor subtype. The CCK2R mediates a wide spectrum of agonist-induced biological effects, including anxiety, pain perception, gastric acid secretion, and growth and differentiation of the gastric mucosa (10Dufresne M. Seva C. Fourmy D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 805-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 12Noble F. Wank S.A. Crawley J.N. Bradwejn J. Seroogy K.B. Hamon M. Roques B.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 745-781PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of wild-type CCK2R and/or expression of a constitutively active variant may contribute to human diseases (10Dufresne M. Seva C. Fourmy D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 805-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). These findings have stimulated interest in the identification of antagonists of CCK2R. To date, a large panel of chemically distinct CCK2R antagonists have been discovered and used to assess the functions mediated by CCK2R in animals and humans (13Herranz R. Med. Res. Rev. 2003; 23: 559-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several of these compounds have reached clinical evaluation stages for indications such as anxiety and panic disorders, sleep disorders, drug dependence, pain, gastroesophagus reflux, and gastric secretion disorders (13Herranz R. Med. Res. Rev. 2003; 23: 559-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, some reference molecules believed to be pure antagonists turned out to be endowed with some agonist activity in the stomach and pancreas as well as cells expressing CCK1R or CCK2R (14Foucaud M.

In previous works, we investigated the intrinsic activation mechanism of the CCK2R and the regulation of this activity by different ligands (15Marco E. Foucaud M. Langer I. Escrieut C. Tikhonova I.G.

Moreover, we delineated the role and mechanism of action of RGS-2 (regulator of G-protein signaling-2) in CCK2R-induced inositol phosphate production (17Langer I. Tikhonova I.G. Boulègue C. Estève J.P. Vatinel S. Ferrand A. Moroder L. Robberecht P. Fourmy D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism and consequences of CCK2R regulation at the cell surface by its natural ligands or by synthetic ligands are not yet precisely known (18Pohl M. Silvente-Poirot S. Pisegna J.R.

In the current study, given the importance of cell surface regulation of GPCR by pharmacological agents, we investigated the mechanisms whereby the CCK2R is regulated after stimulation by its natural agonist ligand CCK or after exposure to several synthetic ligands displaying distinct pharmacological activity with respect to CCK2R-mediated production of inositol phosphates. Results from this study led us to classify the CCK2R as a member of the class B GPCRs with respect to its endocytosis features. Furthermore, this study led to identification of biased agonists that are partial agonists on CCK2R-induced inositol phosphate production and antagonists on β-arrestin recruitment and subsequent receptor endocytosis. The C-terminal region of the CCK2R and more precisely phosphorylatable motif Ser437-Xaa438-Thr439-Thr440-Xaa441-Ser442-Thr443 were identified as critical determinants for β-arrestin recruitment. However, this motif and β-arrestins were dispensable for CCK2R internalization. By providing new important insights into the regulation mechanism of the CCK2R by natural agonists and pharmacological agents, this study represents a solid basis to investigate the contribution of internalized CCK2R·β-arrestin complexes to CCK2R-induced intracellular signaling in cancer cells that endogenously express this receptor. It will also allow us to develop new diagnosis and therapeutic strategies based on the targeting of the CCK2R.

A specific inhibitor of dynamin, dynasore (Calbiochem); an inhibitor of clathrin-dependent uptake, chlorpromazine (Sigma-Aldrich); and an inhibitor of recycling, monensin (Sigma-Aldrich) were also used. The cDNAs encoding CCK2R, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged CCK2R, and Renilla luciferase (Rluc)-fused CCK2R were generated by subcloning the CCK2R cDNA in pcDNA5/FTR (Invitrogen), pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences Clontech), and pRluc-N1(h) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), respectively. DsRed-tagged Rab5, DsRed-tagged Rab11, and DsRed-tagged Rab7 were obtained from Addgene. GFP-tagged β-arrestin1, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged β-arrestin1, and YFP-tagged β-arrestin2 were generous gifts from Marc Caron (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). GFP-tagged β-arrestin2, kindly provided by Robert Lefkowitz (Duke University Medical Center), was subsequently subcloned in pcDNA5/Flp recombination target (FRT). All mutant receptor cDNAs and the GFP-tagged dominant negative V53D-β-arrestin1 and V54D-β-arrestin2 were constructed by an oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) using human CCK2R cDNAs cloned in the pcDNA5/FRT vector and GFP-tagged β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 as templates, respectively. HEK 293 cells stably expressing the CCK2R (Flp-InTM CCK2R-293) and β-arrestin2-GFP (Flp-InTM β-arrestin2-GFP-293) were obtained using the Flp-InTM system (Invitrogen). Flp-InTM 293 cells containing an FRT in their genome were purchased from Invitrogen and cotransfected with pcDNA5/FRT vector carrying CCK2R or β-arrestin2-GFP and the Flp recombinase expression vector pOG44 that mediates integration of the CCK2R-pcDNA5/FRT vector into the genome via FRT sites. Cells that acquired the CCK2R-pcDNA5/FRT vector or β-arrestin2-GFP-pcDNA5/FRT vector were selected using hygromycin B (100 μg/ml; Sigma). MEF cells, wild type and double knock-out for β-arrestins, were generous gifts from Robert Lefkowitz (Duke University Medical Center). Flp-InTM 293 cells, HEK 293 T cells, MEF cells, Flp-InTM β-arrestin2-GFP-293, and Flp-InTM CCK2R-293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, in a humidified atmosphere at 95% air and 5% CO2. Replication-defective, self-inactivating lentiviral vectors were generated in a BSL-3 facility (BiviC core vector production, IFR 150, Toulouse, France) through transient transfection of HEK 293FT cells with packaging and lentiviral vector plasmids using polyethyleneimine. Lentiviral vectors were concentrated by centrifugation using Vivaspin columns and stored at −80 °C. All batches were checked to be replicative virus-free. The viral titers were determined on HT1080 cells and expressed in transduction units/ml. In addition, vector concentrations were quantified by a p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Innotest, Ingen, Paris). To generate MEF cells expressing the CCK2R, cells were incubated with the lentiviral vectors (multiplicity of infection = 1) for 24 h and subsequently selected with Zeocin® (Invivogen, Toulouse, France) at 25 μg/ml for 2 weeks. Efficiency of viral transduction and selection was estimated by measuring the percentage of cells expressing GFP by flow cytometry analysis. Expression of CCK2R was assessed by binding Alexa F 647-CCK. Cells were washed with ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm orthovanadate, pH 7.5) and homogenized in 200 μl of lysis buffer (buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 100 IU/ml Trasylol) for 15 min at 4 °C. The solutes were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The samples were then washed twice with 30 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 30 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore). Membranes were blocked with saline buffer (1 mm Tris, 14 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 5% nonfat dried milk and incubated overnight with the phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (1:500, Cell Signaling, catalog no. 9106) or β-arrestin antibody (1:300, BD Biosciences, catalog no. 610550). Membranes were washed three times with saline buffer containing 5% nonfat dried milk and incubated with secondary antibody anti-mouse (1:5000 dilution) for 3 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times with saline buffer containing 5% nonfat dried milk and incubated with a chemoluminescence HRP Western blotting kit substrate (SuperSignal West Pico Substrate, Pierce, catalog no. 34079) for 5 min before the membrane was unveiled. Cells were plated onto 10-cm culture dishes and grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After overnight incubation, cells were transfected with 1 μg/plate (excepted when mentioned) of pcDNA5/FRT, pEGFP-N1, and pRluc-N1(h) vectors containing the cDNA for the wild-type or mutated CCK2Rs using a Fugene® 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were transferred to 24-well plates 24 h after transfection. HEK 293 cells stably expressing CCK2R (Flp-InTM CCK2R-293) were directly plated onto 24-well plates. Approximately 24 h after transfer to 24-well plates, binding assays were performed using 125I-CCK according to the protocol previously described in detail (16Foucaud M. Marco E. Escrieut C. Low C. Kalindjian B. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35860-35868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Receptor density (Bmax) and Kd were calculated from homologous 125I-CCK competition binding experiments using Ligand software (Kell, Cambridge, UK). Ki values for competitors were calculated using the non-linear curve fitting software GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Cells were plated onto 10-cm culture dishes and grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After overnight incubation, cells were transfected with 1 μg/plate (except when mentioned) of pcDNA5/FRT, pEGFP-N1, and pRluc-N1(h) vectors containing the cDNA for the wild-type and mutated CCK2 receptors or β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 using a Fugene® 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were transferred to 24-well plates 24 h after transfection. HEK 293 cells stably expressing CCK2R (Flp-InTM CCK2R-293) were directly plated onto 24-well plates. Approximately 24 h after transfer to 24-well plates and after overnight incubation in DMEM containing 2 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol (specific activity, 10–25 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), inositol phosphate production was determined as described previously (16Foucaud M. Marco E. Escrieut C. Low C. Kalindjian B. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35860-35868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Flp-InTM CCK2R-293, Flp-InTM β-arrestin2-GFP-293, and Flp-InTM 293 cells were plated onto a poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated four-well Lab-Tek chambered coverglass (catalog no. 155383, Nunc) and grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After overnight incubation, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg/well pcDNA5/FRT containing cDNA encoding GFP-tagged CCK2R, mutated CCK2R, β-arrestin1-GFP, β-arrestin2-GFP, K44A dynamin, V53D dominant negative β-arrestin1-GFP, and V54D dominant negative β-arrestin-GFP using a Fugene® 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). For colocalization experiments, vectors containing cDNA encoding GFP-tagged CCK2R and Rab5-DsRed or Rab11-DsRed or Rab7-DsRed were cotransfected using the same method with 0.5 μg/well for GFP-tagged CCK2R and 1 μg/well for Rabs-DsRed proteins. 24 h after transfection, the DMEM was replaced by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) calcium- and magnesium-free prior to stimulation. Cells were stimulated with appropriate ligand, and images of GFP, DsRed, or Alexa Fluor 647 fluorescence were collected by using single- or double-line excitation (488, 54, or 633 nm, respectively) on a Zeiss laser-scanning microscope (LSM-510). For β-arrestin1-GFP and β-arrestin2-GFP membrane recruitment experiments, time series over a 5-min period were performed (pictures were taken every 30 s), and the decrease of cytoplasmic fluorescence was measured using the region of interest (ROI) function of LSM-510 software. Flp-InTM CCK2R-293 cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated 6-well plates and grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After overnight incubation, cells were treated with CCK (0.1 μm) or synthetic ligands (1 μm) in DMEM containing HEPES (20 mm) at various times. Following stimulation, bound ligand was dissociated from the cells three times with DMEM/HEPES (20 mm), and the remaining receptors at the cell membrane were labeled using a saturating concentration of Alexa F 647-CCK (1 μm) for 2.5 h on ice. Cells were washed twice with PBS, 0.1% BSA. Cells were detached from 6-well plates and transferred to FACS tubes. Cell-associated fluorescence was determined using a BD FACSCaliburTM flow cytometer, with Flp-InTM 293 cells that do not express CCK2R as a negative control. Flp-InTM CCK2R-293 cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated 6-well plates and grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After overnight incubation, cells were treated with 0.1 μm CCK in DMEM/HEPES (20 mm) for 1 h at 37 °C. Following stimulation, cells were washed three times with DMEM/HEPES. The receptors at the cell surface were labeled using Alexa F 647-CCK (1 μm) for 45 min at 37 °C at various times (1, 2, and 3 h) after the end of the CCK stimulation. Binding of Alexa F 647-CCK was carried out in the presence of dynasore (80 μm) in order to block internalization and possible fast recycling during this step of receptor quantification. HEK 293 T or Flp-InTM 293 cells were plated onto 10-cm culture dishes and grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After overnight incubation, cells were transfected with 0.2 μg of Rluc-tagged CCK2R (wild type or mutants) and 10 μg of either β-arrestin1-YFP or β-arrestin2 using polyethyleneimine transfection reagent (Polyplus) or Fugene® 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 24 h after transfection, cells were plated in 96-well clear bottom plates (Corning Glass) at a density of 100,000 cells/well in phenol red-free DMEM. After overnight incubation, the phenol red-free medium was removed from HEK293T cells and replaced by PBS. The BRET assay was initiated by adding 10 μl of the cell-permeant substrate specific for Renilla luciferase, coelenterazine H, to the well to yield a final concentration of 5 μm. The agonist/antagonist activity of the compounds was measured by adding them to the well 5 min after the Rluc substrate. Readings started 10 min after the addition of Rluc substrate. BRET experiments were performed at room temperature in a Mithras LB940 instrument (Berthold) that allows the sequential integration of the signals detected in the 465–505 nm and 515–555 nm windows using filters with the appropriate band pass and by using MicroWin 2000 software. For titration experiments, the acceptor/donor ratio was calculated as described previously (25Masri B. Salahpour A. Didriksen M. Ghisi V. Beaulieu J.M. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). For time course analysis of the interactions between CCK2R and β-arrestin1/2 interactions, coelenterazine H was added 10 min before the addition of PBS, CCK, or compounds. Readings were then collected at 12.5-s intervals for the next 20 min. To investigate the regulation of the CCK2R at the cell surface, we established a HEK 293 cell line that permanently expressed the human CCK2R and was named Flp-InTM CCK2R-293. Homologous competition binding studies with these cells indicated that expressed CCK2R bound 125I-CCK with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 4.8 ± 1.0 nm and a maximum binding capacity of 1.98 ± 0.18 pmol/106 cells. The CCK2R displayed a typical CCK2R-like pharmacology, as shown by the high inhibition constant of selective CCK2R ligands (Ki values as follows: gastrin, 13.2 ± 1.5 nm; JB93,242, 40.6 ± 4.7 nm; JB93,182, 4.2 ± 0.3 nm; PD135,158, 11.7 ± 0.8 nm) and the low inhibition constant of the specific CCK1R antagonist SR27,897 (Ki ≥ 10 μm) (Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, the CCK2R efficiently coupled with phospholipase C as shown by the dose-response curve for CCK-induced inositol phosphate production (EC50 of 4.0 ± 0.4 nm, maximal production ∼50-fold basal level after 1 h of stimulation). In agreement with our previous results (14Foucaud M. Tikhonova I.G. Langer I. Escrieut C. Dufresne M. Seva C. Maigret B. Fourmy D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 680-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16Foucaud M. Marco E. Escrieut C. Low C. Kalindjian B. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35860-35868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), JB93,242 and PD135,158 behaved as partial agonists with respect to inositol phosphate turnover. These two compounds showed efficacies that represented 22 and 42% of that of the full agonists CCK and gastrin (Fig. 1C). However, JB93,182, which acted as a partial inverse agonist on COS-7 cells overexpressing the CCK2R, did not exhibit this activity in Flp-InTM CCK2R-293 due to the lack of detectable basal constitutive activity of the CCK2R in HEK cells (14Foucaud M. Tikhonova I.G. Langer I. Escrieut C. Dufresne M. Seva C. Maigret B. Fourmy D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 680-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Finally, the effect of nonpeptide ligands on ERK1/2 phosphorylation was evaluated because the activation of the CCK2R is recognized to trigger this signaling pathway (10Dufresne M. Seva C. Fourmy D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 805-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, CCK-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was rapid and sustained over time. JB93,182, JB93,242, and PD135,158 also stimulated phosphorylation. Autoradiography scanning indicated that maximal ERK1/2 phosphorylation achieved with JB93,182, JB93,242, and PD135,158 represented ∼15, 30, and 60–70% of the maximum achieved with CCK, respectively (not shown). Endocytosis and trafficking of the CCK2R were traced using fluorescent CCK2R (CCK2R-GFP) and fluorescent CCK (Alexa F 647-CCK). Prior to the use of these tools, biological experiments were carried out in order to check their pharmacological features (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). When transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells, CCK2R-GFP bound 125I-CCK with a dissociation constant of 1.15 ± 0.20 nm (versus 1.17 ± 0.25 nm for CCK2R) and efficiently stimulated production of inositol phosphates after CCK stimulation (EC50 of 2.00 ± 0.23 nm versus 0.53 ± 0.04 nm for CCK2R). Furthermore, Alexa F 647-CCK competed with 125I-CCK to CCK2R similarly to unmodified CCK (Ki = 2.4 ± 0.1 nm for Alexa F 647-CCK inhibited 1251-CCK binding to CCK2R with the same potency as native CCK. Confocal microscopy observation of living HEK 293 cells transiently expressing CCK2R-GFP showed that CCK2R was expressed uniformly at the cell surface as the unmodified CCK2R immediately after its labeling by Alexa F 647-CCK (Fig. 2). However, soon after the addition of CCK or Alexa F 647-CCK, the membrane fluorescence was relocated in numerous membrane clusters and progressively entered the interior of the cells in punctuate peripheral vesicles. The number of these fluorescent ve"
https://openalex.org/W2002659602,"Although bovine pancreatic RNase is one of the best characterized proteins in respect to structure and in vitro refolding, little is known about its synthesis and maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of live cells. We expressed the RNase in live cells and analyzed its folding, quality control, and secretion using pulse-chase analysis and other cell biological techniques. In contrast to the slow in vitro refolding, the protein folded almost instantly after translation and translocation into the ER lumen (t(½) < 3 min). Despite high stability of the native protein, only about half of the RNase reached a secretion competent, monomeric form and was rapidly transported from the rough ER via the Golgi complex (t(½) = 16 min) to the extracellular space (t(½) = 35 min). The rest remained in the ER mainly in the form of dimers and was slowly degraded. The dimers were most likely formed by C-terminal domain swapping since mutation of Asn(113), a residue that stabilizes such dimers, to Ser increased the efficiency of secretion from 59 to 75%. Consistent with stringent ER quality control in vivo, the secreted RNase in the bovine pancreas was mainly monomeric, whereas the enzyme present in the cells also contained 20% dimers. These results suggest that the efficiency of secretion is not only determined by the stability of the native protein but by multiple factors including the stability of secretion-incompetent side products of folding. The presence of N-glycans had little effect on the folding and secretion process."
https://openalex.org/W2030511265,"Background Although Dengue virus (DENV) circulation had been documented in neighbouring South-western Indian Ocean Islands, its presence in Mayotte is poorly characterised. To address this issue, we aimed to assess the seroprevalence of dengue IgG antibodies (DENV-IgG Ab) among the population and to investigate potential associations with individual and household characteristics. Methods/Principal Findings In November–December 2006 we conducted a cross-sectional serologic survey in Mayotte among 1,154 inhabitants aged ≥2 years by using a multistage cluster random sampling method. The overall prevalence of DENV-specific IgG antibodies (ELISA) was 22.73% (95% CI, 18.16–27.31). The age-specific seroprevalence increased with age (χ2 for trend = 11.86, P<0.0006), and was linked with previous known outbreaks in this region. In multivariate analysis, older age, being born in the Comoros and living in a household with a low socioeconomic index were positively associated with DENV IgG antibody positivity. Conclusions These findings document substantial prior exposure of the population of Mayotte to DENV and highlight the risk of severe illness due to the possibility of sequential DENV infections. Further investigations characterizing current DENV circulation patterns and associated serotypes are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2039903339,"NafY participates in the final steps of nitrogenase maturation, having a dual role as iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co) carrier and as chaperone to the FeMo-co-deficient apo-NifDK (apo-dinitrogenase). NafY contains an N-terminal domain of unknown function (n-NafY) and a C-terminal domain (core-NafY) necessary for FeMo-co binding. We show here that n-NafY and core-NafY have very weak interactions in intact NafY. The NMR structure of n-NafY reveals that it belongs to the sterile α-motif (SAM) family of domains, which are frequently involved in protein-protein interactions. The presence of a SAM domain in NafY was unexpected and could not be inferred from its amino acid sequence. Although SAM domains are very commonly found in eukaryotic proteins, they have rarely been identified in prokaryotes. The n-NafY SAM domain binds apo-NifDK. As opposed to full-length NafY, n-NafY impaired FeMo-co insertion when present in molar excess relative to FeMo-co and apo-NifDK. The implications of these observations are discussed to offer a plausible mechanism of FeMo-co insertion. NafY domain structure, molecular tumbling, and interdomain motion, as well as NafY interaction with apo-NifDK are consistent with the function of NafY in FeMo-co delivery to apo-NifDK."
https://openalex.org/W2037155943,"To understand how symmetric structures of many proteins are formed from asymmetric sequences, the proteins with two repeated beta-trefoil domains in Plant Cytotoxin B-chain family and all presently known beta-trefoil proteins are analyzed by structure-based multi-sequence alignments. The results show that all these proteins have similar key structural residues that are distributed symmetrically in their structures. These symmetric key structural residues are further analyzed in terms of inter-residues interaction numbers and B-factors. It is found that they can be distinguished from other residues and have significant propensities for structural framework. This indicates that these key structural residues may conduct the formation of symmetric structures although the sequences are asymmetric."
https://openalex.org/W2060599552,"We demonstrate that the levels of native as well as transfected prion protein (PrP) are lowered in various cell lines exposed to phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (PS-DNA) and can be rapidly reverted to their normal amounts by removal of PS-DNA. This transient modulation was independent of the glycosylation state of PrP, and in addition, all three PrP glycoforms were susceptible to PS-DNA treatment. Deletion of the N-terminal domain (amino acids 23-99), but not of the other domains of PrP, abrogated its PS-DNA-mediated down-regulation. PrP versions localized in the mitochondria, cytoplasm, or nucleus were not modulated by PS-DNA, indicating that PrP surface exposure is required for executing this effect. Proteins that in their native forms were not responsive to PS-DNA, such as thymocyte antigen 1 (Thy1), Doppel protein (Dpl), green fluorescent protein (GFP), and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), became susceptible to PS-DNA-mediated down-regulation following introduction of the N terminus of PrP into their sequence. These observations demonstrate the essential role of the N-terminal domain for promoting oligonucleotide-mediated reduction of the PrP level and suggest that transient treatment of cultured cells with PS-DNA may provide a general method for targeted modulation of the levels of desired surface proteins in a conditional and reversible manner."
https://openalex.org/W1990018400,"Background Detailed analysis of the dynamic interactions among biological, environmental, social, and economic factors that favour the spread of certain diseases is extremely useful for designing effective control strategies. Diseases like tuberculosis that kills somebody every 15 seconds in the world, require methods that take into account the disease dynamics to design truly efficient control and surveillance strategies. The usual and well established statistical approaches provide insights into the cause-effect relationships that favour disease transmission but they only estimate risk areas, spatial or temporal trends. Here we introduce a novel approach that allows figuring out the dynamical behaviour of the disease spreading. This information can subsequently be used to validate mathematical models of the dissemination process from which the underlying mechanisms that are responsible for this spreading could be inferred. Methodology/Principal Findings The method presented here is based on the analysis of the spread of tuberculosis in a Brazilian endemic city during five consecutive years. The detailed analysis of the spatio-temporal correlation of the yearly geo-referenced data, using different characteristic times of the disease evolution, allowed us to trace the temporal path of the aetiological agent, to locate the sources of infection, and to characterize the dynamics of disease spreading. Consequently, the method also allowed for the identification of socio-economic factors that influence the process. Conclusions/Significance The information obtained can contribute to more effective budget allocation, drug distribution and recruitment of human skilled resources, as well as guiding the design of vaccination programs. We propose that this novel strategy can also be applied to the evaluation of other diseases as well as other social processes."
https://openalex.org/W2072570941,"Ccc2, the yeast copper-transporting ATPase, pumps copper from the cytosol to the Golgi lumen. During its catalytic cycle, Ccc2 undergoes auto-phosphorylation on Asp627 and uses the energy gained to transport copper across the cell membrane. We previously demonstrated that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) controls the energy interconversion CuE∼P → E-P + Cu when Ser258 is phosphorylated. We now demonstrate that Ser258 is essential in vivo for copper homeostasis in extremely low copper and iron concentrations. The S258A mutation abrogates all PKA-mediated phosphorylations of Ccc2, whereas the S971A mutation leads to a 100% increase in its global regulatory phosphorylation. With S258A, the first-order rate constant of catalytic phosphorylation by ATP decreases from 0.057 to 0.030 s−1, with an 8-fold decrease in the burst of initial phosphorylation. With the S971A mutant, the rate constant decreases to 0.007 s−1. PKAi5–24 decreases the amount of the aspartylphosphate intermediate (EP) in Ccc2 wt by 50% within 1 min, but not in S258A, S971A, or S258A/S971A. The increase of the initial burst and the extremely slow phosphorylation when the “phosphomimetic” mutant S258D was assayed (k = 0.0036 s−1), indicate that electrostatic and conformational (non-electrostatic) mechanisms are involved in the regulatory role of Ser258. Accumulation of an ADP-insensitive form in S971A demonstrates that Ser971 is required to accelerate the hydrolysis of the E-P form during turnover.

IntroductionCopper plays an essential role in all known organisms. Transition metal properties give it the capacity to accept and donate electrons, and therefore to act as a cofactor in a broad diversity of enzymes that catalyze a great variety of reactions (1Lutsenko S. Barnes N.L. Bartee M.Y. Dmitriev O.Y. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1011-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Different active copper transporters (Cu(I)-ATPases) present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1Lutsenko S. Barnes N.L. Bartee M.Y. Dmitriev O.Y. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1011-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 2Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 2009; 284: 25461-25465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) play a pivotal role in the homeostatic control of intracellular metal concentration. Active copper transport in mammals is mediated by two different ATPases: ATP7A (the Menkes ATPase) and ATP7B (the Wilson ATPase). Whereas ATP7A is ubiquitous, ATP7B is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes and in distinct scattered cell types in the central nervous system, kidney, placenta, and mammary glands (5Bull P.C. Thomas G.R. Rommens J.M. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). In humans, impaired copper delivery to the secretory/biosynthetic pathway and the circulatory system leads to severe conditions such as Wilson and Menkes diseases.Just as mammalian cells have machinery for copper homeostasis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains homologous proteins for each corresponding function, physiologically coupling copper capture, intracellular trafficking, and delivery to a variety of acceptors. The yeast Cu(I)-ATPase, known as Ccc2, transports copper to protein acceptors in the lumen of the Golgi complex (6Fu D. Beeler T.J. Dunn T.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Copper delivery to the trans Golgi network (TGN) 4The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans Golgi network; E∼P, high-energy phosphoenzyme; E-P, low-energy phosphoenzyme; PKAi5–24, PKA inhibitor peptide 5–24; pkaPS, PKA prediction sites. lumen is essential for iron metabolism in yeast, as the iron transporter Ftr1p must be activated by Fet3p in the TGN, which requires copper as a cofactor (7Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of Ccc2 in iron metabolism in yeast is similar to that in mammalian ATP7B with respect to ceruloplasmin, a protein synthesized in the hepatocyte TGN (8Terada K. Nakako T.

For this reason, S. cerevisiae is a valuable model for studying copper homeostasis.Considerable progress has been made toward elucidating catalytic phosphorylation by Cu(I)-ATPases (4Kaplan J.H.

However, few reports have addressed the role of their kinase-mediated regulatory phosphorylation in the subcellular trafficking and localization of the copper pumps, particularly in response to copper levels (12Vanderwerf S.M.

Valova V.A. Gaeth A.P. Palstra N. Hannan K.M. Michell B.J. Kelly L.E. Jennings I. Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Robinson P.J. Camakaris J. Int. J. Biochem.

The importance of regulatory phosphorylation for the catalytic cycle was recently demonstrated for ATP7B (16Pilankatta R. Lewis D. Adams C.M. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21307-21316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Our group has demonstrated that Ser258 of Ccc2 is the target for copper-dependent PKA-mediated phosphorylation, which is crucial for correct energy interconversion at the E∼P → E-P step of the catalytic cycle (17Valverde R.H. Morin I. Lowe J. Mintz E. Cuillel M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of this serine is evident; its mutation to Ala leads to the progressive accumulation of the CuE∼P form as long as Ccc2 undergoes turnover. This serine residue, which has the highest score for PKA phosphorylation in Ccc2 (17Valverde R.H. Morin I. Lowe J. Mintz E. Cuillel M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), is located at the boundary between the N-terminal domain and the ATPase core. Because the N-terminal domain acts as a copper sensor for catalysis in Cu(I)-ATPases (15Bartee M.Y. Ralle M. Lutsenko S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 5573-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Pilankatta R. Lewis D. Adams C.M. Inesi G. J. Biol.

FEBS J. 2009; 276: 4483-4495Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we investigated whether copper-dependent PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Ser258 modulates the early steps of the catalytic cycle that involve copper handling: the transition Cu(I) + E → CuE and the subsequent phosphoryl transfer ATP + CuE → CuE∼P + ADP (Fig. 1B) (10Lowe J. Vieyra A. Catty P. Guillain F. Mintz E. Cuillel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25986-25994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), where Asp627 in the active site is the acceptor of the γ-phosphoryl group. In addition, we investigated the possible regulatory role of another serine residue with a high score for PKA recognition and phosphorylation, i.e. Ser971 (17Valverde R.H. Morin I. Lowe J. Mintz E. Cuillel M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which is located at the end of Ccc2 C terminus.DISCUSSIONHaving previously demonstrated that Ccc2, the yeast homologue of mammalian Cu(I)-ATPases, is phosphorylated by kinases, and that PKA, acting on a serine residue (Ser258) with the highest predicted score for phosphorylation, is a pivotal modulator of the key step during catalysis (energy interconversion and copper translocation (17Valverde R.H. Morin I. Lowe J. Mintz E. Cuillel M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)), we now demonstrate that: (i) Ser258 is essential for in vivo copper homeostasis when copper and iron in the medium are limiting; (ii) Ser258 and Ser971 influence other regulatory sites; (iii) there is interplay between Ser258 and Ser971; (iv) these regulatory sites play specific roles in distinct and key steps during the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis and active copper transport mediated by Ccc2. Therefore, the long-range intramolecular communications between these two serines ensure an appropriate sequence of events through the catalytic cycle.Sf9 cells used to express Ccc2 and its variants have abundant and equivalent amounts of PKA associated with the cell membranes, as demonstrated by immunoanalysis in Fig. 3A. We exploited this fact in evaluating the PKAi5–24-sensitive kinase activity of the membranes (Fig. 3B). The high endogenous kinase activity in Sf9 membranes is partially (∼50%) due to the action of PKA, because it is inhibited to the same extent by the PKAi5–24 peptide (Fig. 3B). This PKA-mediated phosphorylation is responsible for 30–40% of the total kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Ccc2 (Fig. 4). Remarkably, PKA-mediated regulatory phosphorylation of the copper pump is no longer evident when Ser258 is replaced by Ala (Fig. 4), though there are other serine residues with high scores for PKA-mediated phosphorylation (e.g. Ser971) in the primary structure of Ccc2 (17Valverde R.H. Morin I. Lowe J. Mintz E. Cuillel M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that Ser971 exerts negative control on other residues in Ccc2 that are targets for PKA and other kinases (Fig. 4). For example, phosphosites targeted by casein kinases have been proposed in ATP7B (12Vanderwerf S.M. Cooper M.J. Stetsenko I.V. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36289-36294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and several of them can be detected in the primary structure of Ccc2 with the use of NetPhosK 1.0. Furthermore, we can predict a threonine residue in Ccc2 (Thr894) located in the large cytosolic loop after the nucleotide binding site that is highly scored for PKC phosphorylation (0.95). Several of these uncharacterized phosphosites could be copper-sensitive, as is the case in human Cu(I)-ATPases (14Veldhuis N.A. Valova V.A. Gaeth A.P. Palstra N. Hannan K.M. Michell B.J. Kelly L.E. Jennings I. Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Robinson P.J. Camakaris J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41: 2403-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Bartee M.Y. Ralle M. Lutsenko S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 5573-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Pilankatta R. Lewis D. Adams C.M. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21307-21316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). If so, this would be physiologically important in regulating copper pumping activity under the control of Ser258 and Ser971.If there are other PKA-phosphosites in Ccc2 besides Ser258, then why are these sites unphosphorylated when Ser258 phosphorylation is prevented by substitution with Ala? The fact that mutation of Ser258 to Ala strongly diminishes (by 50%) the overall regulatory phosphosignal, abolishes the PKAi5–24 effect (Fig. 4) and prevents the regulatory hyperphosphorylation seen after addition of purified PKA α-catalytic subunit (17Valverde R.H. Morin I. Lowe J. Mintz E. Cuillel M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), suggests that Ser258 is a coordinating switch for phosphorylation of other residues. The assumption is therefore that Ser258 phosphorylation enables access to other phosphosites. Analogous to the regulatory phosphorylation of Ccc2 described here, a controller regulatory phosphosite has been implicated in the concerted regulation by kinases of two very different processes of electrophysiological and metabolic significance. Gating of neuronal Na+-channels in response to membrane depolarization (30Li M. West J.W. Numann R. Murphy B.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1439-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and perilipin facilitation of lipolitic cleavage of fat droplets (31Miyoshi H. Perfield 2nd, J.W. Souza S.C. Shen W.J. Zhang H.H. Stancheva Z.S. Kraemer F.B. Obin M.S. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 996-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) are examples demonstrating that obligatory phosphorylation of a key residue allows convergent and synergistic kinase-mediated processes to occur.Possibly because of its central role as a controller of a complex kinase-mediated network in Ccc2, Ser258 has a pronounced effect on the catalytic cycle that extends beyond that previously described for the E∼P → E-P transition (17Valverde R.H. Morin I. Lowe J. Mintz E. Cuillel M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The fact that inhibition of aspartylphosphate formation by PKAi5–24 occurs with the wild type Ccc2 (Fig. 7, left panels) whereas the response to PKAi5–24 is completely lost in S258A (Fig. 7, right panels), indicates that Ser258 simultaneously controls kinase-mediated phosphorylating cascades acting on Ccc2 (Fig. 4) and the phosphoryl transfer from ATP to Asp627 at the catalytic site (Fig. 7, step 2 in the scheme depicted in Fig. 1B), together with the previously described conversion of the high- to the low-energy aspartylphosphate intermediate (17Valverde R.H. Morin I. Lowe J. Mintz E. Cuillel M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The higher level of aspartylphosphate in this mutant at 1 min (Fig. 5), and the lower rate constant of aspartylphosphate formation (Table 1) are indicative that Ser258 phosphorylation modulates the rate of phosphoryl transfer from ATP to Asp627 (step 2 in Fig. 1B), supporting the idea that it could influence the coupling between ATP utilization and copper transport. In addition, the 8-fold decrease in the size of the phosphorylation burst evident with S258A (Table 1) indicates that, besides its previously demonstrated influence on the CuE∼P → E-P + Culum transition (17Valverde R.H. Morin I. Lowe J. Mintz E. Cuillel M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and on the rate of aspartylphosphate formation (Fig. 6), a serine residue that can undergo PKA-mediated phosphorylation with a high score also influences the Cu + E → CuE transition at the beginning of the cycle. The insensitivity to PKAi5–24 of the S258A mutant (Fig. 8) does not appear to be related to abrogated PKA-mediated phosphorylation at Ser258 (Fig. 4) since the S258A mutation resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in aspartylphosphate levels at 1 min (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 8) rather than an inhibition. On the contrary, catalytic phosphorylation of the S971A mutant at 1 min was similar to that of Ccc2 in the presence of PKAi5–24 (Fig. 10C), suggesting that PKA-mediated phosphorylation at Ser971 also regulates Ccc2 wt turnover.Catalytic phosphorylation of S971A is insensitive to PKAi5–24, as in the case with S258A (FIGURE 8, FIGURE 10C). Therefore, Ser971 and Ser258 appear to be under long range intramolecular and reciprocal control. Thus, the aforementioned results support the idea that a PKA-mediated regulatory network exerts delicate control over phosphoryl transfer to Asp627 at the catalytic site. Ser258 and Ser971 appear to have concerted but selective roles in the evolution of the phosphorylated intermediate during catalysis. Whereas regulatory phosphorylation of Ser258 is required for the CuE∼P → E-P + Cu conversion (and copper dissociation) (17Valverde R.H. Morin I. Lowe J. Mintz E. Cuillel M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of Ser971 is critical for the breakdown of the ADP-insensitive, low-energy phosphorylated intermediate (Fig. 10B), as well as influencing the beginning of the cycle (Fig. 10A). It is likely that Ser971 exerts its influence, at least in part, by acting as a switch that controls kinase-mediated phosphorylation of other residues, as revealed by the observations depicted in Fig. 4 concerning S971A and S258A/S971A.The mutant S258D sheds some light on the mechanism by which Ser258 participates in the regulation of the Ccc2 catalytic cycle (Fig. 7, Table 1). Introduction of a permanent negative charge in this position increased the phosphorylation burst, which was followed by an extremely slow phosphorylation. They probably represent a rapid formation of CuE∼P from initially available CuE and a slower one after the E + Cu → CuE transition (Fig. 1B). The increased burst and the very slow phosphoryl transfer with accumulation of E-P, together with the lower k measured with the S258A mutant, support the view that the presence of a stable “phosphomimetic” atmosphere in this region: (i) accelerates phosphoryl transfer, (ii) decreases the E + Cu → CuE conversion, and (iii) impairs hydrolysis of the phosphorylated intermediate during turnover (Fig. 1B). Because regulatory phosphorylation decreased in S258A, these combined results are compatible with a combination of electrostatic and non-electrostatic influences of Ser258 as demonstrated in other processes where phosphorylatable serines are involved (31Miyoshi H. Perfield 2nd, J.W. Souza S.C. Shen W.J. Zhang H.H. Stancheva Z.S. Kraemer F.B. Obin M.S. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 996-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 32Arokium H. Ouerfelli H. Velours G. Camougrand N. Vallette F.M. Manon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35104-35112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they support the view of alternating regulatory phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events catalyzed by kinases and phosphatases, as early suggested for ATP7B (33Vanderwerf S.M. Lutsenko S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 739-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).To investigate whether there is a true sequential influence of both serines on the catalytic cycle and if Ser258 behaves as a switch that dictates the proper order of events during catalysis (i.e. the sequential formation of high- and low-energy phosphorylated intermediate) the double mutant S258A/S971A was created to examine whether a progressive increase in ADP-sensitivity can be recovered. Fig. 11 demonstrates this to be the case: a gradual accumulation of the ADP-sensitive aspartylphosphate revealed that the profile governed by the absence of Ser258 was encountered again, i.e. E∼P → E-P was impaired. The percent levels of ADP-sensitive aspartylphosphate, although they increase with time, are not as great as those found with the S258A mutant. This is certainly because the mutation of Ser971 in the double mutant also impairs the breakdown of the ADP-insensitive intermediate.Apart from the well-known role of copper pumps in regulating the subcellular location and trafficking of copper (12Vanderwerf S.M.

Pearson R.B. Robinson P.J. Camakaris J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41: 2403-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), our previous work (17Valverde R.H. Morin I. Lowe J. Mintz E. Cuillel M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in conjunction with the present study points to the significance of kinase-mediated phosphorylation during the most important steps of the Ccc2 catalytic cycle and the central role of Ser258 in this process. It is possible that the conserved serine in a topologically equivalent region of the polypeptide chain, i.e. in the short sequence of the N-terminal domain close to the first transmembrane domain, plays a similar pivotal regulatory role in other copper ATPases such as human ATP7A and ATP7B. The recently-developed prediction tool pkaPS (28Neuberger G. Schneider G. Eisenhaber F. Biol. Direct. 2007; 2: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) demonstrates that, as with Ser258 in Ccc2, a phosphorylatable Ser653 in human ATP7A and ATP7B is located in a conserved motif at the hinge region connecting the N-terminal domain to the core of the copper pump (Fig. 12). Therefore, this conserved serine may have an important role in PKA-mediated regulation of the human Cu(I)-ATPases, as the alignment demonstrates that Ser653 lies in a PKA recognition consensus sequence (27Shabb J.B. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2381-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).Ser653 exhibited a relatively low profile as a target for PKA in ATP7B using pkaPS and its phosphorylation was not detected by mass spectrometry (16Pilankatta R. Lewis D. Adams C.M. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21307-21316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but its physiological relevance is unambiguous as mutating it to Tyr leads to one of the most severe and early clinical alterations in copper metabolism (34Gromadzka G. Schmidt H.H. Genschel J. Bochow B. Rodo M. Tarnacka B. Litwin T. Chabik G. Czlonkowska A. Clin. Genet. 2005; 68: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is interesting that a phosphorylatable serine residue at the entrance to the first transmembrane domain has also been found in the α-catalytic subunit of the (Na++K+) ATPase (35Sweadner K.J. Feschenko M.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1017-C1026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and furthermore its accessibility to the kinase increases in the NaE rather than in the KE form. By analogy, the presence of copper, and therefore of CuE, may favor the exposure of Ser258, thus explaining the copper dependence of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Ccc2. IntroductionCopper plays an essential role in all known organisms. Transition metal properties give it the capacity to accept and donate electrons, and therefore to act as a cofactor in a broad diversity of enzymes that catalyze a great variety of reactions (1Lutsenko S. Barnes N.L. Bartee M.Y. Dmitriev O.Y. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1011-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Different active copper transporters (Cu(I)-ATPases) present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1Lutsenko S. Barnes N.L. Bartee M.Y. Dmitriev O.Y. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1011-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 2Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 3Rosen B.P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr.

Chem. 2009; 284: 25461-25465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) play a pivotal role in the homeostatic control of intracellular metal concentration. Active copper transport in mammals is mediated by two different ATPases: ATP7A (the Menkes ATPase) and ATP7B (the Wilson ATPase). Whereas ATP7A is ubiquitous, ATP7B is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes and in distinct scattered cell types in the central nervous system, kidney, placenta, and mammary glands (5Bull P.C. Thomas G.R. Rommens J.M. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). In humans, impaired copper delivery to the secretory/biosynthetic pathway and the circulatory system leads to severe conditions such as Wilson and Menkes diseases.Just as mammalian cells have machinery for copper homeostasis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains homologous proteins for each corresponding function, physiologically coupling copper capture, intracellular trafficking, and delivery to a variety of acceptors. The yeast Cu(I)-ATPase, known as Ccc2, transports copper to protein acceptors in the lumen of the Golgi complex (6Fu D. Beeler T.J. Dunn T.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Copper delivery to the trans Golgi network (TGN) 4The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans Golgi network; E∼P, high-energy phosphoenzyme; E-P, low-energy phosphoenzyme; PKAi5–24, PKA inhibitor peptide 5–24; pkaPS, PKA prediction sites. lumen is essential for iron metabolism in yeast, as the iron transporter Ftr1p must be activated by Fet3p in the TGN, which requires copper as a cofactor (7Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of Ccc2 in iron metabolism in yeast is similar to that in mammalian ATP7B with respect to ceruloplasmin, a protein synthesized in the hepatocyte TGN (8Terada K. Nakako T. Yang X.L. Iida M. Aiba N. Minamiya Y. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Miura N. Sugiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1815-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For this reason, S. cerevisiae is a valuable model for studying copper homeostasis.Considerable progress has been made toward elucidating catalytic phosphorylation by Cu(I)-ATPases (4Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25461-25465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 9Lutsenko S. Efremov R.G. Tsivkovskii R. Walker J.M. J. Bioenerg.

Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2007; 39: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). However, few reports have addressed the role of their kinase-mediated regulatory phosphorylation in the subcellular trafficking and localization of the copper pumps, particularly in response to copper levels (12Vanderwerf S.M.

The involvement of a cyclic AMP-dependent kinase (PKA) in the intracellular movement of ATP7A in response to increased intracellular copper concentration was demonstrated by Cobbold et al. (13Cobbold C. Ponnambalam S. Francis M.J. Monaco A.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2855-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and more recent studies point to the occurrence of kinase-mediated phosphorylation in different domains of both the human Cu(I)-ATPases (14Veldhuis N.A.

The importance of regulatory phosphorylation for the catalytic cycle was recently demonstrated for ATP7B (16Pilankatta R. Lewis D. Adams C.M. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21307-21316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Our group has demonstrated that Ser258 of Ccc2 is the target for copper-dependent PKA-mediated phosphorylation, which is crucial for correct energy interconversion at the E∼P → E-P step of the catalytic cycle (17Valverde R.H. Morin I. Lowe J. Mintz E. Cuillel M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of this serine is evident; its mutation to Ala leads to the progressive accumulation of the CuE∼P form as long as Ccc2 undergoes turnover. This serine residue, which has the highest score for PKA phosphorylation in Ccc2 (17Valverde R.H. Morin I. Lowe J. Mintz E. Cuillel M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), is located at the boundary between the N-terminal domain and the ATPase core. Because the N-terminal domain acts as a copper sensor for catalysis in Cu(I)-ATPases (15Bartee M.Y. Ralle M. Lutsenko S.
