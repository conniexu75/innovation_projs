https://openalex.org/W4291792037,"Ethanol and lactate are typical waste products of glucose fermentation. In mammals, glucose is catabolized by glycolysis into circulating lactate, which is broadly used throughout the body as a carbohydrate fuel. Individual cells can both uptake and excrete lactate, uncoupling glycolysis from glucose oxidation. Here we show that similar uncoupling occurs in budding yeast batch cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Issatchenkia orientalis. Even in fermenting S. cerevisiae that is net releasing ethanol, media 13C-ethanol rapidly enters and is oxidized to acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA. This is evident in exogenous ethanol being a major source of both cytosolic and mitochondrial acetyl units. 2H-tracing reveals that ethanol is also a major source of both NADH and NADPH high-energy electrons, and this role is augmented under oxidative stress conditions. Thus, uncoupling of glycolysis from the oxidation of glucose-derived carbon via rapidly reversible reactions is a conserved feature of eukaryotic metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4293064448,"Raising environmental awareness and product development are two separate and costly investments that many small and medium-sized fashion businesses cannot afford to achieve sustainability. Therefore, there is a need to determine which factors exert a more significant impact on consumer loyalty and purchase intention toward eco-friendly fashions. Thus, this study employs a mixed-methods approach with thematic analysis and the SEM-PLS technique to research how Vietnamese Gen Z's perceptions of product-service quality, environmental awareness, and pro-environmental behavior influence their purchase intention and loyalty toward eco-friendly fashion products. Most interviewees acknowledged that they primarily gained knowledge about eco-friendly fashion through social media platforms. The qualitative results further showed that their knowledge of and attitudes toward eco-friendly fashion practices were insufficient to convince young customers to afford eco-friendly fashion products. The SEM-PLS results of 313 participants show that while customers' perceived behavioral control plays a more significant role in stimulating purchase intention, only product-service quality factors impact loyalty. Hence, this study suggests that businesses should prioritize improving service and product quality rather than funding green marketing when targeting Vietnamese Gen Z in case of financial constraints. Government should prioritize financial and technological support for fashion firms to develop high-quality eco-friendly fashion to ensure the product availability."
https://openalex.org/W4292058583,"The hallmark feature of Diabetes mellitus (DM) is hyperglycemia which can lead to excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the myocardium, contributing to diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor2 (Nrf2), a transcriptional activator, enhances its ability to resist oxidative stress by activating multiple downstream anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatory proteins, and detoxifying enzymes. However, the mechanism of Nrf2 signaling in HG-induced DCM is unclear. In this study, we used HG pretreated H9c2 cells as the experimental basis in vitro, and established a high fat-diet, streptozotocin (STZ) induced Type 2 diabetic rat model in vivo. Meanwhile, we used shRNA-Nrf2 and curcumin (CUR) (as an activator) to affect H9c2 cells, to verify the role of the Nrf2 signaling pathway in DCM. The results showed that the excessive production of ROS caused by HG, which could inhibit the activation of Nrf2-related signaling, resulting in a decrease in cell energy metabolism and an increase in cell apoptosis. Surprisingly, we found that the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway significantly increased cardiomyocyte viability, reduced ROS formation, increased antioxidant enzyme activity, and inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In conclusion, these findings conclusively infer that CUR activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway exerts myocardial protection by reducing ROS formation."
https://openalex.org/W4292184413,"Factors influencing inter-individual variability of responses to resistance training (RT) remain to be fully elucidated. We have proposed the importance of capillarization in skeletal muscle for the satellite cell (SC) response to RT-induced muscle hypertrophy, and hypothesized that aerobic conditioning (AC) would augment RT-induced adaptations. Fourteen healthy young (22 ± 2 years) men and women underwent AC via 6 weeks of unilateral cycling followed by 10 weeks of bilateral RT to investigate how AC alters SC content, activity, and muscle hypertrophy following RT. Muscle biopsies were taken at baseline (unilateral), post AC (bilateral), and post RT (bilateral) in the aerobically conditioned (AC + RT) and unconditioned (RT) legs. Immunofluorescence was used to determine muscle capillarization, fiber size, SC content, and activity. Type I and type II fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) increased following RT, and when legs were analyzed independently, AC + RT increased type I, type II, and mixed-fiber CSA, where the RT leg tended to increase type II (p = .05), but not type I or mixed-fiber CSA. SC content, activation, and differentiation increased with RT, where type I total and quiescent SC content was greater in AC + RT compared to the RT leg. Those with the greatest capillary-to-fiber perimeter exchange index before RT had the greatest change in CSA following RT and a significant relationship was observed between type II fiber capillarization and the change in type II-fiber CSA with RT (r = 0.35). This study demonstrates that AC prior to RT can augment RT-induced muscle adaptions and that these differences are associated with increases in capillarization."
https://openalex.org/W4293063320,"With the recent advances in the field of alternate agriculture, there has been an ever-growing demand for aquaponics as a potential substitute for traditional agricultural techniques for improving sustainable food production. However, the lack of data-driven methods and approaches for aquaponic cultivation remains a challenge. The objective of this research is to investigate statistical methods to make inferences using small datasets for nutrient control in aquaponics to optimize yield. In this work, we employed the Density-Based Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (DB-SMOTE) to address dataset imbalance, and ExtraTreesClassifer and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to choose the relevant features. Synthetic data generation techniques such as the Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling techniques were used to generate enough data points and different feature engineering techniques were used on the predictors before evaluating the performance of kernel-based classifiers with the goal of controlling nutrients in the aquaponic solution for optimal growth.[27–35]"
https://openalex.org/W4291993891,"This study evaluated the effects of maternal fish oil supplementation rich in n-3 PUFA on the performance and bone health of offspring broilers at embryonic development stage and at market age. Ross 708 broiler breeder hens were fed standard diets containing either 2.3% soybean oil (SO) or fish oil (FO) for 28 days. Their fertilized eggs were collected and hatched. For a pre-hatch study, left tibia samples were collected at 18 days of incubation. For a post-hatch study, a total of 240 male chicks from each maternal treatment were randomly selected and assigned to 12 floor pens and provided with the same broiler diets. At 42 days of age, growth performance, body composition, bone microstructure, and expression of key bone marrow osteogenic and adipogenic genes were evaluated. One-way ANOVA was performed, and means were compared by student's t-test. Maternal use of FO in breeder hen diet increased bone mineral content (p < 0.01), bone tissue volume (p < 0.05), and bone surface area (p < 0.05), but decreased total porosity volume (p < 0.01) during the embryonic development period. The FO group showed higher body weight gain and feed intake at the finisher stage than the SO group. Body composition analyses by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry showed that the FO group had higher fat percentage and higher fat mass at day 1, but higher lean mass and total body mass at market age. The decreased expression of key adipogenic genes in the FO group suggested that prenatal FO supplementation in breeder hen diet suppressed adipogenesis in offspring bone marrow. Furthermore, no major differences were observed in expression of osteogenesis marker genes, microstructure change in trabecular bone, or bone mineral density. However, a significant higher close pores/open pores ratio suggested an improvement on bone health of the FO group. Thus, this study indicates that maternal fish oil diet rich in n-3 PUFA could have a favorable impact on fat mass and skeletal integrity in broiler offspring."
https://openalex.org/W4291227549,"Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2) regulates metabolism, cell proliferation, and cell survival. mTORC2 activity is stimulated by growth factors, and it phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif site of the AGC kinases AKT, SGK, and PKC. However, the proteins that interact with mTORC2 to control its activity and localization remain poorly defined. To identify mTORC2-interacting proteins in living cells, we tagged endogenous RICTOR, an essential mTORC2 subunit, with the modified BirA biotin ligase BioID2 and performed live-cell proximity labeling. We identified 215 RICTOR-proximal proteins, including proteins with known mTORC2 pathway interactions, and 135 proteins (63%) not previously linked to mTORC2 signaling, including nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Our imaging and cell fractionation experiments suggest nearly 30% of RICTOR is in the nucleus, hinting at potential nuclear functions. We also identified 29 interactors containing RICTOR-dependent, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation sites, thus providing insight into mTORC2-dependent insulin signaling dynamics. Finally, we identify the endogenous ADP ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) GTPase as an mTORC2-interacting protein. Through gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies, we provide functional evidence that ARF1 may negatively regulate mTORC2. In summary, we present a new method of studying endogenous mTORC2, a resource of RICTOR/mTORC2 protein interactions in living cells, and a potential mechanism of mTORC2 regulation by the ARF1 GTPase."
https://openalex.org/W4291926392,"Macrophage infiltration plays an important role in the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Previously, we demonstrated that highglucose-stimulated macrophage-derived exosomes (HG-exo) induces proliferation and extracellular matrix accumulation in glomerular mesangial cells, but its effect on tubular cells is unclear. This study aimed to explore the role of HG-exo on renal tubular injury in DN. The results show that HG-exo could induce dysfunction, autophagy inhibition, and inflammation in mouse tubular epithelial cell (mTEC) and C57 mouse kidney. Moreover, miR-7002-5p was differentially expressed in HG-exo based on miRNAs sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. A dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that Atg9b was the direct target gene of miR-7002-5p. Further experimentation showed that miR-7002-5p inhibition in vivo and vitro reserves HG-exo effects. These results demonstrated that HG-exo carries excessive miR-7002-5p and inhibits autophagy through targeting Atg9b; this process then induces renal tubular dysfunction and inflammation. In conclusion, our study clarifies the important role of macrophage-derived exosomes in DN and is expected to provide new insight on DN prevention and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4293063630,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are known as molecular carriers involved in cell communication and the regulation of (patho)physiological processes. miRNAs and growth factors are the main contents of EVs which make them a good candidate for the treatment of diseases caused by ischemia, but the low production of EVs by a cell producer and a significant variation of the molecular contents in EVs according to the cell source are the main limitations of their widespread use. Here, we show how to improve the therapeutic properties of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-derived EVs (MSC-EVs) by modifying MSCs to enrich these EVs with specific angiomiRs (miR-135b or miR-210) using lentiviral vectors carrying miR-135b or miR-210. MSCs were obtained from the mouse bone marrow and transduced with a corresponding lentivector to overexpress miR-135b or miR-210. The EVs were then isolated by ultracentrifugation and characterized using a flow cytometer and a nanoparticle tracking analyzer. The levels of 20 genes in the MSCs and 12 microRNAs in both MSCs and EVs were assessed by RT‒qPCR. The proangiogenic activity of EVs was subsequently assessed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The results confirmed the overexpression of the respective microRNA in modified MSCs. Moreover, miR-135b overexpression upregulated miR-210-5p and follistatin, whereas the overexpression of miR-210 downregulated miR-221 and upregulated miR-296. The tube formation assay showed that EVs from MSCs overexpressing miR-210-5p (EVmiR210) significantly promoted tubular structure formation in HUVECs. A significant increase in angiogenic proteins (PGF, endothelin 1, and artemin) and genes (VEGF, activin A, and IGFBP1) in HUVECs treated with VEmiR210 justifies the better tubular structure formation of these cells compared with that of EVmiR135b-treated HUVECs, which showed upregulated expression of only artemin. Collectively, our results show that the EV cargo can be modified by lentiviral vectors to enrich specific miRNAs to achieve a specific angiogenic potential."
https://openalex.org/W3085229103,"Data used to train supervised machine learning models are commonly split into independent training, validation, and test sets. This paper illustrates that complex data leakage cases have occurred in the no-reference image and video quality assessment literature. Recently, papers in several journals reported performance results well above the best in the field. However, our analysis shows that information from the test set was inappropriately used in the training process in different ways and that the claimed performance results cannot be achieved. When correcting for the data leakage, the performances of the approaches drop even below the state-of-the-art by a large margin. Additionally, we investigate end-to-end variations to the discussed approaches, which do not improve upon the original."

https://openalex.org/W4293063230,"Perinatal asphyxia (PA) still occurs in about three to five per 1,000 deliveries in developed countries; 20% of these infants show hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of our study was to apply metabolomic analysis to newborns undergoing therapeutic hypothermia (TH) after PA to identify a distinct metabotype associated with the development of HIE on brain MRI. We enrolled 53 infants born at >35 weeks of gestation with PA: 21 of them showed HIE on brain MRI (the ""HIE"" group), and 32 did not (the ""no HIE"" group). Urine samples were collected at 24, 48 and 72 hours of TH. Metabolomic data were acquired using high-resolution mass spectrometry and analyzed with univariate and multivariate methods. Considering the first urines collected during TH, untargeted analysis found 111 relevant predictors capable of discriminating between the two groups. Of 35 metabolites showing independent discriminatory power, four have been well characterized: L-alanine, Creatine, L-3-methylhistidine, and L-lysine. The first three relate to cellular energy metabolism; their involvement suggests a multimodal derangement of cellular energy metabolism during PA/HIE. In addition, seven other metabolites with a lower annotation level (proline betaine, L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine, 2-methyl-dodecanedioic acid, S-(2-methylpropionyl)-dihydrolipoamide-E, 2,6 dimethylheptanoyl carnitine, Octanoylglucuronide, 19-hydroxyandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione) showed biological consistency with the clinical picture of PA. Moreover, 4 annotated metabolites (L-lysine, L-3-methylhistidine, 2-methyl-dodecanedioic acid, S-(2-methylpropionyl)-dihydrolipoamide-E) retained a significant difference between the ""HIE"" and ""no HIE"" groups during all the TH treatment. Our analysis identified a distinct urinary metabotype associated with pathological findings on MRI, and discovered 2 putative markers (L-lysine, L-3-methylhistidine) which may be useful for identifying neonates at risk of developing HIE after PA."
https://openalex.org/W4291993863,"Objective Inflammation of brain structures, in particular the hippocampal formation, can induce neuronal degeneration and be associated with increased excitability manifesting as propensity for repetitive seizures. An increase in the abundance of individual proinflammatory molecules including interleukin 1 beta has been observed in brain tissue samples of patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and corresponding animal models. The NLRP3-inflammasome, a cytosolic protein complex, acts as a key regulator in proinflammatory innate immune signalling. Upon activation, it leads to the release of interleukin 1 beta and inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration. Transient brain insults, like status epilepticus (SE), can render hippocampi chronically hyperexcitable and induce segmental neurodegeneration. The underlying mechanisms are referred to as epileptogenesis. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that distinct NLRP3-dependent transcript and protein signalling dynamics are induced by SE and whether they differ between two classical SE models. We further correlated the association of NLRP3-related transcript abundance with convulsive activity in human TLE hippocampi of patients with and without associated neurodegenerative damage. Methods Hippocampal mRNA- and protein-expression of NLRP3 and associated signalling molecules were analysed longitudinally in pilocarpine- and kainic acid-induced SE TLE mouse models. Complementarily, we studied NLRP3 inflammasome-associated transcript patterns in epileptogenic hippocampi with different damage patterns of pharmacoresistant TLE patients that had undergone epilepsy surgery for seizure relief. Results Pilocarpine- and kainic acid-induced SE elicit distinct hippocampal Nlrp3 -associated molecular signalling. Transcriptional activation of NLRP3 pathway elements is associated with seizure activity but independent of the particular neuronal damage phenotype in KA-induced and in human TLE hippocampi. Significance These data suggest highly dynamic inflammasome signalling in SE-induced TLE and highlight a vicious cycle associated with seizure activity. Our results provide promising perspectives for the inflammasome signalling pathway as a target for anti-epileptogenic and -convulsive therapeutic strategies. The latter may even applicable to a particularly broad spectrum of TLE patients with currently pharmacoresistant disease."
https://openalex.org/W4293064086,"Hydrodynamics on coral reefs vary with depth, reef morphology and seascape position. Differences in hydrodynamic regimes strongly influence the structure and function of coral reef ecosystems. Submerged coral reefs on steep-sided, conical bathymetric features like seamounts experience enhanced water circulation as a result of interactions between currents and the abrupt physical structure. There may also be similar interactions between smaller pinnacles and regional water currents in offshore locations (crests &gt; 10 m), while shallow reefs (crests &lt;10 m) may be more subject to surface currents driven by wind, waves and tide. Here we tested whether coral pinnacles experienced stronger and more variable currents compared to emergent reefs at the same depth in both nearshore and offshore positions. Current speeds and temperature were monitored for 12 months at 11 reefs, representing the three different reef categories: submerged offshore pinnacles, emergent offshore reefs and emergent nearshore reefs. We found different patterns in current speeds and temperature among reef types throughout the year and between seasons. Submerged pinnacles exhibited stronger, more variable current speeds compared to both near and offshore emergent reefs. We found seasonal changes in current speeds for pinnacle and nearshore reefs but no variation in current strength on offshore reefs. Whilst instantaneous current directions did reflect the seascape position of individual sites, there was no difference in the directional variability of current speeds between reef types. Annual daily average temperatures at all reef types were not strongly seasonal, changing by less than 2 °C throughout the year. Daily temperature ranges at specific sites however, exhibited considerable variability (annual range of up to 6.5 °C), particularly amongst offshore emergent reefs which experienced the highest temperatures despite greater exposure to regional-scale circulation patterns. Additionally, we found a consistent mismatch between satellite sea surface temperatures and in-situ temperature data, which was on average 2 °C cooler throughout the annual study period. Our results suggest that distinct hydrodynamic processes occur on smaller submerged structures that are physically analogous to seamounts. Our findings highlight important nuances in environmental processes that occur on morphologically distinct coral reef habitats and these are likely to be important drivers for the community dynamics of organisms that inhabit these reefs."
https://openalex.org/W4291227584,"Class A tick evasins are natural chemokine-binding proteins that block the signaling of multiple chemokines from the CC subfamily through their cognate receptors, thus suppressing leukocyte recruitment and inflammation. Development of tick evasins as chemokine-targeted anti-inflammatory therapeutics requires an understanding of the factors controlling their chemokine recognition and selectivity. To investigate the role of the evasin N-terminal region for chemokine recognition, we prepared chimeric evasins by interchanging the N-terminal regions of four class A evasins, including a newly identified evasin, EVA-RPU02. We show through chemokine binding analysis of the parental and chimeric evasins that the N-terminal region is critical for chemokine binding affinity and selectivity. Notably, we found some chimeras were unable to bind certain cognate chemokine ligands of both parental evasins. Moreover, unlike any natural evasins characterized to date, some chimeras exhibited specific binding to a single chemokine. These results indicate that the evasin N terminus interacts cooperatively with the ""body"" of the evasin to enable optimum chemokine recognition. Furthermore, the altered chemokine selectivity of the chimeras validates the approach of engineering the N termini of evasins to yield unique chemokine recognition profiles."

https://openalex.org/W4291993569,"Near-surface air temperature (Ta) is an important parameter in agricultural production and climate change. Satellite remote sensing data provide an effective way to estimate regional-scale air temperature. Therefore, taking Gansu section of the upper Weihe River Basin as the study area, using the filtered reconstructed high-quality long-time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), interpolated reconstructed land surface temperature (LST), surface albedo, and digital elevation model (DEM) as the input data, the back-propagation artificial neural network algorithm (BP-ANN) was combined with a multiple linear regression method to estimate regional air temperature, and the influencing factors of air temperature estimation were analyzed. This method effectively compensates for the fact that air temperature data provided by a single station cannot represent regional air temperature information. The result shows that the temperature estimation accuracy is high. In terms of interannual variation, the air temperature in the study area showed a slightly increasing trend, with an average annual increase of 0.047°C. The calculation results of the interannual variation rate of temperature showed that the area with increased air temperature accounted for 75.8% of the total area. In terms of seasonal variation, compared with that in summer and winter, the air temperature rising trend in autumn was obvious, and the air temperature in the middle of the study area decreased in spring, which is prone to frost disasters. LST and NDVI in the study area were positively correlated with air temperature, and their positive correlation distribution areas accounted for 93.62% and 94.34% of the total study area, respectively. NDVI, LST and DEM influence the temperature change in the study area. The results show that there is a significant positive correlation between NDVI and air temperature, and the change of NDVI has a positive effect on the spatiotemporal variation of air temperature. The correlation coefficient between LST and air temperature in the southeast of the study area is negative, and there is a difference. In addition, the correlation coefficient between LST and air temperature in other areas of the study area is positive. The air temperature decreased with elevation, air temperature decreases by 0.27°C every hundred meters."
https://openalex.org/W4291993731,"eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a new trend of machine learning. Machine learning models are used to predict or decide something, and they derive output based on a large volume of data set. Here, the problem is that it is hard to know why such prediction was derived, especially when using deep learning models. It makes the models unreliable in the case of reliability-critical applications. So, it is required to explain how they derived such output. It is a reliability-critical application for self-driving cars because the mistakes made by the computers inside them can lead to critical accidents. So, it is necessary to adopt XAI models in this field. In this paper, we propose an XAI method based on computing and explaining the difference of the output values of the neurons in the last hidden layer of convolutional neural networks. First, we input the original image and some modified images of it. Then we derive output values for each image and compare these values. Then, we introduce the Sensitivity Analysis technique to explain which parts of the original image are needed to distinguish the category. In detail, we divide the image into several parts and fill these parts with shades. First, we compute the influence value on the vector indicating the last hidden layer of the model for each of these parts. Then we draw shades whose darkness is in proportion to the influence values. The experimental results show that our approach for XAI in self-driving cars finds the parts needed to distinguish the category of these images accurately."
https://openalex.org/W4291994002,"Background The role of the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is mostly unknown, despite increasing evidence that lncRNAs extensively participate in physiological and pathological conditions. Aim To detect the level of lncRNA-Cox2, HOTAIR, IL-6, and MMP-9 in the serum of SLE patients and to correlate these levels with disease activity and patients’ clinical and laboratory data to evaluate the value of these biomarkers for SLE diagnosis and assessment of disease activity. Methods Blood samples from 58 SLE patients, and 60 healthy controls (HCs) were used for detection of lncRNAs-Cox2 and HOTAIR expression levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Both IL-6 and MMP-9 serum levels were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Lupus activity was assessed with the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). Results The serum expression levels of lncRNA-Cox2 and HOTAIR were significantly up-regulated in SLE patients vs HCs (fold change [median (IQR) was 1.29(0.81–1.71, P &lt;0.0001) and 2.68(0.95–3.67), P = 0.038) for lncRNA-Cox2 and HOTAIR, respectively. Serum levels of both IL-6 and MMP-9 were significantly high in SLE patients compared with HCs ( P≤ 0.001 for each). The up-regulated lncRNA-Cox2 was positively associated with the presence of neurological manifestations in SLE patients ( P = 0.007). Furthermore, HOTAIR expression level had significantly positive correlation with IL-6 ( r = 0.578, P &lt;0.0001), MMP-9 level (r = 0.762, P &lt;0.0001), nephritis grades ( r = 0.296, P = 0.024) and proteinuria ( r = 0.287, P = 0.035). LncRNA-Cox2 showed sensitivity and specificity 72.4%, and 100.0% respectively. HOTAIR sensitivity was 60.3%, and specificity was 100.0%. By multiple logistic regression analysis, lncRNA-Cox2 and HOTAIR were found as SLE independent predictors. Conclusion LncRNA-COX2 and HOTAIR can be used as new non-invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis of SLE."

https://openalex.org/W4292182459,"In the context of economic games, adults sacrifice money to avoid unequal outcomes, showing so-called inequity aversion. Child-friendly adaptations of these games have shown that children, too, show inequity aversion. Moreover, inequity aversion shows a clear developmental trajectory, with young children rejecting only disadvantageously unequal distributions and older children rejecting both disadvantageously and advantageously unequal distributions. However, based on existing work, it is difficult to compare adult and child responses to inequity because (1) adapting economic games to make them child-friendly may importantly alter the dynamics of the fairness interaction and (2) adult work typically uses abstract rewards such as money while work with children typically uses more concrete rewards like candy, stickers or toys. Here we adapted the Inequity Game-a paradigm designed to study children's responses to inequality in isolation from other concerns-to test inequity aversion in adults (N = 104 pairs). We manipulated whether participants made decisions about concrete rewards (candy) or abstract rewards (tokens that could be traded in for money). We found that, like children, adults rejected unequal payoffs in this task. Additionally, we found that reward type mattered: adults rejected disadvantageous-but not advantageous-monetary distributions, yet rejected both disadvantageous and advantageous candy distributions. These findings allow us to draw clearer comparisons across child and adult responses to unfairness and help paint a fuller picture of inequity aversion in humans."

The collection of data was through a cross-section design and survey questionnaires as the tool for data collection among 259 participants from 15 healthcare facilities in Dubai. The study further utilised the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithm and the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) in the analysis of the data collected. The study's data proved that the intention of using an EMR system was the most influential and predictor of the actual use of the system. It was also found that TAM construct was directly influenced by anxiety, innovativeness, self-efficacy, and trust. The behavioural intention of an individual regarding EMR was also proved to positively influence the use of an EMR system. This study proves to be useful practically by providing healthcare decision-makers with a guide on factors to consider and what to avoid when implementing strategies and policies."

EVOO, enriched in polyphenols and other minority components, exerts a distinct effect on health. Using next generation sequencing, we have studied early and long-term effects of both types of fats on the intestinal microbiota of mice, finding significant differences between the two diets in the percentage of certain bacterial taxa, correlating with hormonal, physiological and metabolic parameters in the host. These correlations are not only concomitant, but most noticeably some of the changes detected in the microbial percentages at six weeks are correlating with changes in physiological values detected later, at twelve weeks. Desulfovibrionaceae/Desulfovibrio/D. sulfuricans stand out by presenting at six weeks a statistically significant higher percentage in the butter-fed mice with respect to the EVOO group, correlating with systolic blood pressure, food intake, water intake and insulin at twelve weeks. This not only suggests an early implication in the probability of developing altered physiological and biochemical responses later on in the host lifespan, but also opens the possibility of using this genus as a marker in the risk of suffering different pathologies in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4293063881,"In an era of growing international competition in modern viticulture, the study and implementation of innovative technologies to increase the production of high-quality grapes and wines are of critical importance. In this study, the non-destructive portable sensor Multiplex, based on fluorescence sensing technique, was applied to evaluate grape maturity parameters and flavonol content of the understudied Pinot blanc variety. The effects of environmental and agronomical factors on flavonol content of Pinot blanc grapes were investigated in eight vineyards characterised by different microclimatic and agronomic conditions. Furthermore, the direct impact of canopy management treatment on the flavonol dynamics of the grapes oriented in the four cardinal directions was assessed. Results highlight the positive role of moderate temperatures and direct sunlight exposure on Pinot blanc flavonol content; however, no direct vineyard-elevation effect was observed. The ability to modulate and evaluate the flavonol content in field represent crucial factors because of their potential effect on flavonoids-dependent wine characteristics, such as stability and ageing. In the present study, for the first time, two calibration curves were reported for pre- and post-veraison periods between flavonol indices and the berry skin flavonol content and a good correlation was observed between Multiplex measurement and the total polyphenolic content of grape juice. Moreover, the strong correlation between the chlorophyll index with grape juice sugar content and titratable acidity revealed the practical application of non-destructive sensors to predict the optimal harvest time for Pinot blanc grapes. In conclusion, the non-destructive fluorescence sensor Multiplex is a high-potential tool for innovative viticulture, for evaluating grape skin composition variables in white grape varieties."

Mill mud is enriched with organic carbon, nitrogen, and nutrient minerals; no prior report utilized 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the microbial composition. Mill mud could be applied to agricultural fields as biofertilizer to replace or supplement chemical fertilizers, and as bio-stimulant to replenish microorganisms and organic carbon depleted by erosion and post-harvest field burning. However, mill mud has historically caused waste management challenges in the United States. This study reports on the chemical and microbial (16S rRNA) characteristics for mill muds of diverse origin and ages. Chemical signature (high phosphorus) distinguished mill mud from bagasse (high carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio) and soil (high pH) samples of diverse geographical/environmental origins. Bacterial alpha diversity of all sample types (mill mud, bagasse, and soil) was inversely correlated with C/N. Firmicutes dominated the microbial composition of fresh byproducts (mill mud and bagasse) as-produced within the operating factory. Upon aging and environmental exposure, the microbial community of the byproducts diversified to resemble that of soils, and became dominated by varying proportions of other phyla such as Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Planctomyces. In summary, chemical properties allowed grouping of sample types (mill mud, bagasse, and soil-like), and microbial diversity analyses visualized aging caused by outdoor exposures including soil amendment and composting. Results suggest that a transient turnover of microbiome by amendments shifts towards more resilient population governed by the chemistry of bulk soil."
https://openalex.org/W4291993564,"Objective To prospectively establish an early diagnosis model of acute colon cancerous bowel obstruction by applying nuclear magnetic resonance hydrogen spectroscopy(1H NMR) technology based metabolomics methods, combined with machine learning. Methods In this study, serum samples of 71 patients with acute bowel obstruction requiring emergency surgery who were admitted to the Emergency Department of Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital from December 2018 to November 2020 were collected within 2 hours after admission, and NMR spectroscopy data was taken after pretreatment. After postoperative pathological confirmation, they were divided into colon cancerous bowel obstruction (CBO) group and adhesive bowel obstruction (ABO) control group. Used MestReNova software to extract the two sets of spectra bins, and used the MetaboAnalyst5.0 website to perform partial least square discrimination (PLS-DA), combining the human metabolome database (HMDB) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) to find possible different Metabolites and related metabolic pathways. Results 22 patients were classified as CBO group and 30 were classified as ABO control group. Compared with ABO group, the level of Xanthurenic acid, 3-Hydroxyanthranilic acid, Gentisic acid, Salicyluric acid, Ferulic acid, Kynurenic acid, CDP, Mandelic acid, NADPH, FAD, Phenylpyruvate, Allyl isothiocyanate, and Vanillylmandelic acid increased in the CBO group; while the lecel of L-Tryptophan and Bilirubin decreased. There were significant differences between two groups in the tryptophan metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism and synthesis pathways of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan (all P&lt;0.05). Tryptophan metabolism pathway had the greatest impact (Impact = 0.19). The early diagnosis model of colon cancerous bowel was established based on the levels of six metabolites: Xanthurenic acid, 3-Hydroxyanthranilic acid, Gentisic acid, Salicylic acid, Ferulic acid and Kynurenic acid (R2 = 0.995, Q2 = 0.931, RMSE = 0.239, AUC = 0.962). Conclusion This study firstly used serum to determine the difference in metabolome between patients with colon cancerous bowel obstruction and those with adhesive bowel obstruction. The study found that the metabolic information carried by the serum was sufficient to discriminate the two groups of patients and provided the theoretical supporting for the future using of the more convenient sample for the differential diagnosis of patients with colon cancerous bowel obstruction. Quantitative experiments on a large number of samples were still needed in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4291993665,"The propensity to have children, which, according to the view accepted in the literature, is a good predictor of actual childbearing, is of particular importance in countries with low fertility rates and economic prosperity. In this paper, we report the results of a representative survey of 15,700 respondents in 2021 of university students in an emerging market economy in Central Europe, mapping their intentions to have children. The PLS-SEM data analysis method was used to test our hypotheses on the relationships between social, economic, and environmental variables of childbearing. Our results confirm the dominant role of socio-cultural inclusiveness in childbearing, over socio-economic and environmental-economic factors. The novelty of our research lies in the impact analysis of family policy incentives; however, our results are consistent with those documented in the literature, namely, the primacy of socio-cultural factors in the willingness of childbearing."
https://openalex.org/W4291993892,"Background Globally, socioeconomic status (SES) is an important health determinant across a range of health conditions and diseases. However, measuring SES within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) can be particularly challenging given the variation and diversity of LMIC populations. Objective The current study investigates whether maternal SES as assessed by the newly developed Global Network-SES Index is associated with pregnancy outcomes (stillbirths, perinatal mortality, and neonatal mortality) in six LMICs: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guatemala, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Zambia. Methods The analysis included data from 87,923 women enrolled in the Maternal and Newborn Health Registry of the NICHD-funded Global Network for Women’s and Children’s Health Research. Generalized estimating equations models were computed for each outcome by SES level (high, moderate, or low) and controlling for site, maternal age, parity, years of schooling, body mass index, and facility birth, including sampling cluster as a random effect. Results Women with low SES had significantly higher risks for stillbirth (p &lt; 0.001), perinatal mortality (p = 0.001), and neonatal mortality (p = 0.005) than women with high SES. In addition, those with moderate SES had significantly higher risks of stillbirth (p = 0.003) and perinatal mortality (p = 0.008) in comparison to those with high SES. Conclusion The SES categories were associated with pregnancy outcomes, supporting the validity of the index as a non–income-based measure of SES for use in studies of pregnancy outcomes in LMICs."

Using tourist flows data between 221 countries/regions over 1995-2018, we investigate the nature and development patterns of structural properties of global network as well as factors influencing its formation. The descriptive analysis indicates that global tourist network was a sparse network with small world network characteristics. According to centrality characteristics, China showed the most influence in the BRI group, while Germany and the United States possessed key roles among non-BRI countries/regions. Exploratory analysis demonstrated significant influence of gravity variables in global, BRI and non-BRI tourist networks. This research advances existing tourism theory and provides practical implications for policymakers."
https://openalex.org/W4291993998,"The damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is closely related to high mortality in critically ill patients, which is attributable, in part, to the lack of an early method of diagnosis to show the degree of ischemia-induced injury in this type of patients. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) has been shown to be a tool to early diagnose gastric mucosal damage induced by ischemia. A therapeutic alternative to reduce this type of injury is melatonin (MT), which has gastroprotective effects in I/R models. In this work, the effect of treatment with MT on the electrical properties of gastric tissue, biomarkers of inflammatory (iNOS and COX-2), proliferation, and apoptotic process under I/R conditions in male Wistar rats was evaluated through EIS, histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Treatment with MT prevents gastric mucosa damage, causing a decrease in gastric impedance parameters related to the inflammatory process and cellular damage. This suggests that EIS could be used as a tool to diagnose and monitor the evolution of gastric mucosal injury, as well as in the recovery process in critically ill patients."

https://openalex.org/W4293064130,"Previous research found that conspiracy beliefs were usually activated when individuals faced different types of psychological threats and that they led mainly to maladaptive individual and societal outcomes. In this research, we assumed that potential harmfulness of conspiracy beliefs may depend on the context, and we focused on the link between food industry conspiracy beliefs and conscious food choices. We hypothesized that food industry conspiracy beliefs may allow for a constructive attempt to protect oneself against real or imagined enemies (i.e., food industry companies) by conscious food choices (e.g., paying attention to how much the food products are processed). We tested this hypothesis among Polish participants (Study 1; N = 608; cross-sectional and Study 2; N = 790; experimental). Study 1 confirmed that context-specific conspiracy beliefs (but not general notions of conspiracy) are associated with adaptive consumer behaviors. Study 2 showed that inducing feelings of threat related to the possibility of purchasing food contaminated by a harmful bacteria (vs. control condition) increased food industry conspiracy beliefs, which were further positively linked to conscious food choices. We discuss the role of threat and conspiracy beliefs in adaptive consumer behaviors related to food choices."
https://openalex.org/W4291432436,"Conformational conversion of the cellular prion protein, PrPC, into the amyloidogenic isoform, PrPSc, is a key pathogenic event in prion diseases. However, the conversion mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we generated Tg(PrPΔ91-106)-8545/Prnp0/0 mice, which overexpress mouse PrP lacking residues 91-106. We showed that none of the mice became sick after intracerebral inoculation with RML, 22L, and FK-1 prion strains nor accumulated PrPScΔ91-106 in their brains except for a small amount of PrPScΔ91-106 detected in one 22L-inoculated mouse. However, they developed disease around 85 days after inoculation with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) prions with PrPScΔ91-106 in their brains. These results suggest that residues 91-106 are important for PrPC conversion into PrPSc in infection with RML, 22L, and FK-1 prions but not BSE prions. We then narrowed down the residues 91-106 by transducing various PrP deletional mutants into RML- and 22L-infected cells and identified that PrP mutants lacking residues 97-99 failed to convert into PrPSc in these cells. Our in vitro conversion assay also showed that RML, 22L, and FK-1 prions did not convert PrPΔ97-99 into PrPScΔ97-99, but BSE prions did. We further found that PrP mutants with proline residues at positions 97 to 99 or charged residues at positions 97 and 99 completely or almost completely lost their converting activity into PrPSc in RML- and 22L-infected cells. These results suggest that the structurally flexible and noncharged residues 97-99 could be important for PrPC conversion into PrPSc following infection with RML, 22L, and FK-1 prions but not BSE prions."
https://openalex.org/W4291993625,"Aims The Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) shock stages have been applied and validated in high-income countries with access to advanced therapies. We applied the SCAI scheme at the time of admission in order to improve the risk stratification for 30-day mortality in a retrospective cohort of patients with STEMI in a middle-income country hospital at admission. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study, we analyzed 7,143 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. At admission, patients were stratified by the SCAI shock stages. Multivariate analysis was used to assess the association between SCAI shock stages to 30-day mortality. Results The distribution of the patients across SCAI shock stages was 82.2%, 9.3%, 1.2%, 1.5%, and 0.8% to A, B, C, D, and E, respectively. Patients with SCAI stages C, D, and E were more likely to have high-risk features. There was a stepwise significant increase in unadjusted 30-day mortality across the SCAI shock stages (6.3%, 8.4%, 62.4%, 75.2% and 88.3% for A, B, C, D and E, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001, C-statistic, 0.64). A trend toward a lower 30-day survival probability was observed in the patients with advanced CS (30.3, 15.4%, and 8.3%, SCAI shock stages C, D, and E, respectively, Log-rank P-value &lt;0.0001). After multivariable adjustment, SCAI shock stages C, D, and E were independently associated with an increased risk of 30-day death (hazard ratio 1.42 [P = 0.02], 2.30 [P&lt;0.0001], and 3.44 [P&lt;0.0001], respectively). Conclusion The SCAI shock stages applied in patients con STEMI at the time of admission, is a useful tool for risk stratification in patients across the full spectrum of CS and is a predictor of 30-day mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4291993657,"Pixel Value Ordering (PVO) holds an impressive property for high fidelity Reversible Data Hiding (RDH). In this paper, we introduce a dual PVO (dPVO) for Prediction Error Expansion (PEE), and thereby develop a new RDH scheme to offer a better rate-distortion performance. Particularly, we propose to embed in two phases: forward and backward . In the forward phase, PVO with classic PEE is applied to every non-overlapping image block of size 1 × 3. In the backward phase, minimum-set and maximum-set of pixels are determined from the pixels predicted in the forward phase. The minimum set only contains the lowest predicted pixels and the maximum set contains the largest predicted pixels of each image block. Proposed dPVO with PEE is then applied to both sets, so that the pixel values of minimum set are increased and that of the maximum set are decreased by a unit value. Thereby, the pixels predicted in the forward embedding can partially be restored to their original values resulting in both a better embedded image quality and a higher embedding rate. Experimental results have recorded a promising rate-distortion performance of our scheme with a significant improvement of embedded image quality at higher embedding rates compared to the popular and state-of-the-art PVO-based RDH schemes."
https://openalex.org/W4291993674,"The hypothalamus is implicated in controlling feeding and adiposity, besides many other physiological functions, and thus can be of great importance in explaining productive differences between lean and fatty pig breeds. The present study aimed to evaluate the hypothalamic transcriptome of pure Iberian (IBxIB) and Large White x Iberian crossbreds (IBxLW) at 60 days-old, produced in a single maternal environment. Results showed the implication of gender and genotype in the hypothalamic transcriptome, with 51 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between genotypes and 10 DEGs between genders. Fourteen genotype by sex interactions were found, due to a higher genotype effect on transcriptome found in males. In fact, just 31 DEGs were identified when using only females but 158 using only males. A higher expression of genes related to mitochondrial activity in IBxIB male animals (ND3, ND4, ND5, UQCRC2 and ATP6) was found, which was related to a higher oxidative phosphorylation and greater reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide production. IBxLW male animals showed higher expression of SIRT3 regulator, also related to mitochondrial function. When females were analysed, such differences were not found, since only some differences in genes related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Thus, the results indicate a significant effect and interaction of the breed and the sex on the hypothalamic transcriptome at this early age."

This information will provide insights into the antibody kinetics over a relatively long period as well as transmission risk factors in the community. We aim to prospectively observe and determine the kinetics of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody for 2 years after infection in relation to disease severity and to determine the risk and protective factors of SARS CoV-2 infections in the community. A cohort of RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (case) will be prospectively followed for 2 years and will be compared to a control population. The control group comprises SARS-CoV-2 non-infected people who live within a one-kilometer radius from the corresponding case (location matching). This study will recruit at least 165 patients and 495 controls. Demographics, community variables, behavioral characteristics, and relevant clinical data will be collected. Serum samples taken at various time points will be tested for IgM anti-Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and IgG anti-Spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 by using Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA) method. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to calculate cumulative seroconversion rates, and their association with disease severity will be estimated by logistic regression. The risk and protective factors associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection will be determined using conditional (matched) logistic regression and presented as an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval."

The main purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) and hemorrhagic complications in patients after operative treatment of intracranial meningiomas and to identify the risk factors in this patient subgroup. Of 106 patients undergoing elective craniotomy for meningioma overall incidence of symptomatic VTE was noted in 5.7% (six patients). For the risk-factor analysis older age (57.20 ± 11.60 vs. 71.00 ± 0.90 years, p < 0.001), higher body mass index (27.60 ± 4.80 vs. 33.16 ± 0.60 kg/m2, p < 0.001), WHO grade II (3.00% vs. 33.33%, p = 0.02), lower intraoperative blood loss (466.00 ± 383.70 vs. 216.70 ± 68.30 mL, p < 0.001), bedridden status and neurologic deficit (0.00% vs. 33.33%, p = 0.003 and 38.00% vs. 100.00%, p = 0.004) were associated with greater VTE risk. No risk factors for hemorrhagic complications were identified on univariate analysis. In conclusion, the incidence of VTE in meningioma patients is not negligible. Identified risk factors should be taken into account in the decision-making process for chemoprophylaxis when the risk of bleeding decreases."
https://openalex.org/W4291993886,"Background Despite the emphasis placed on Community Based Tuberculosis Care (CBTC) implementation by Health Extension Workers (HEWs) within the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) in Ethiopia, there is little evidence on contribution of HEWs on TB case notification. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the contribution of HEWs on TB case notification and its associated factors in Tigray region, Northern Ethiopia. Methods A concurrent mixed method (quantitative and qualitative) cross-sectional study design was conducted in three randomly selected districts in Tigray region, Northern Ethiopia. Quantitative data were collected using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire. Qualitative data were collected using Focused Group Discussions (FGDs) and Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) to further describe the community participation and presumptive TB identification and referral system. For the quantitative data, binary logistic regression analysis was done and all variables with P-value of &lt; 0.25 in bivariate analysis were included in the multi-variable model to see predictors of HEWs contribution to TB notification. The qualitative data were thematically analyzed using Atlas.ti version 7. Results In this study, a total of 68 HEWs were included. From March 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018, a total of 427 TB cases notified in the study areas and one-third (34%) of them were notified by the HEWs referral. Provision of Community Based-Directly Observed Treatment Short course (CB–DOTS) (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 3.63, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.18–11.19) and involvement of community volunteers on CBTC (AOR = 3.31, 95% CI = 1.10–10.09) were significantly associated with the contribution of HEWs on TB case notification. The qualitative findings indicated that high workload of HEWs, inaccessibility of TB diagnostic services at nearby health facilities, and transportation and investigation costs were identified as factors affecting for presumptive TB referral by HEWs. Conclusions Provision of CB-DOTS and involvement of community volunteers in CBTC activities should be strengthened to improve the HEWs contribution on TB case notification. Additionally, HEWs should be empowered and further interventions of TB diagnostic services at diagnostic health facilities are needed to improve presumptive TB referral by HEWs."

Mazao Tickoff is a novel bioacaricide developed for tick control and is based on the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae sensu lato (s.l.) isolate ICIPE 7. To date, no randomized controlled study has been undertaken to demonstrate the efficacy of this bioacaricide in reducing natural tick infestation on cattle. To this end, this field trial is designed to evaluate the anti-tick efficacy of Mazao Tickoff on cattle in coastal Kenya compared to a standard chemical tick control protocol. In this prospective, multi-center randomized controlled trial, eligible herds will be randomized by the herd size to the intervention arm in a 1:1:1 ratio to either Triatix ® (active ingredient: amitraz); Mazao Tickoff (active ingredient: M . anisopliae ICIPE 7); or placebo (excipients of the Mazao Tickoff), with a total enrollment target of 1,077 cattle. Treatments will be dispensed on Day 0 (defined individually as the day each animal receives the first treatment) and thereafter every two weeks until Day 182. Ticks will be counted on every animal in each herd (herds to be included have at least one animal bearing at least one tick on Day 0), and thereafter on bi-weekly intervals until Day 182. The primary efficacy assessments of Mazao Tickoff will be based on the mean percentage reduction in tick counts at each post-treatment follow-up visit compared to the placebo group and the Triatix ® arm. Further, the effect of Mazao Tickoff on the prevalence of common cattle pathogens, Anaplasma marginale and Theileria parva , will be determined by assessing incidence and seroprevalence at four different time points. This protocol describes the first rigorous evaluation of the efficacy of Mazao Tickoff and its potential as a viable alternative non-chemical acaricide tool for tick control in Kenya and elsewhere."

Instead of the cord, breast-mouth connection will be the next route in the extra uterine life. Nevertheless, limited data in our locality show the duration for how long immediate newborns are fasting. Objective This study aimed to assess time to initiation of breastfeeding and its predictors among postnatal mothers within 12 hours of birth in Debre Markos Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, North West Ethiopia, 2020. Methods A Facility based prospective follow-up study was conducted among 475 participants who were selected using systematic random sampling techniques. To collect the data, techniques including interview, chart review and observation were used. Data was entered to Epi-data version 3.1 and analyzed by STATA 14 software. A cox proportional hazards regression model was fitted to identify predictors for survival time. Results of the final model were expressed in terms of adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) with 95% confidence interval, statistical significance was declared with P-value is less than 0.05. Results Newborns were fasting breast-milk for the median time of 2 hours. In this study, 25% of participants initiated breastfeeding within 1 hour, pre-lacteal while 75% initiated within 3 hours. Gave birth to multiple babies (AHR 0.37, 95% CI (0.19, 0.69)), operative delivery (AHR 0.77, 95% CI (0.62, 0.96)), got advice on timely initiation of breastfeeding immediately after delivery (AHR 0.79, 95% CI (0.63, 0.97)), pre-lacteal feeding initiation (AHR 10.41, 95% CI (2.82, 38.47)) and neonatal sickness (AHR 0.08, 95% CI (0.03–0.19)) were statistically significant predictors for time to initiation of breastfeeding. Conclusion Fifty percent of mothers initiated breastfeeding within 2 hours. Most of them didn’t initiate breastfeeding based on world health organization’s recommendation, within one hour after delivery. Multiple birth, operative delivery, getting advice on timely initiation of breastfeeding immediately after delivery, giving pre-lacteal feeding and neonatal sickness were found to be predictors of time to initiation of breastfeeding."

Evaluation of HIV-specific T cell responses is of importance to study natural infection, and therapeutic and vaccine interventions. Experimentally derived CD4 + and CD8 + HIV epitopes from the HIV molecular immunology database were developed into Class I and Class II HIV megapools (MPs). We assessed HIV responses in persons with HIV pre antiretroviral therapy (ART) (n = 17) and post-ART (n = 18) and compared these responses to 15 controls without HIV (matched by sex at birth, age, and ethnicity). Using the Activation Induced Marker (AIM) assay, we quantified HIV-specific total CD4 + , memory CD4 + , circulating T follicular helper, total CD8 + and memory CD8 + T cells. We also compared the Class I and Class II HIV MPs to commercially available HIV gag peptide pools. Overall, HIV Class II MP detected HIV-specific CD4 + T cells in 21/35 (60%) HIV positive samples and 0/15 HIV negative samples. HIV Class I MP detected an HIV-specific CD8 + T cells in 17/35 (48.6%) HIV positive samples and 0/15 HIV negative samples.

The study of the later stages of the reduction sequence is fundamental to understanding the techno-functional features of any toolkit. In Australia, a gap exists in the study of the chaîne opératoire of lithic tools shaped or re-shaped through percussion retouching. In our previous works (Martellotta EF., 2021, Martellotta EF., 2022), we have presented evidence for the use of hardwood boomerangs for retouching purposes in Australian Aboriginal communities. Through a detailed experimental protocol, the present study demonstrates how boomerangs can function as retouchers. We found that the use-wear generated on the boomerang’s surface during retouch activity is comparable to retouch-induced impact traces observed on Palaeolithic bone retouchers, as well as to experimental bone retouchers generated in our replication experiments. Finally, we explore the role that microscopic lithic chips embedded in the retouchers’ surface play in the formation process of retouching marks. Our results address the need for a deeper investigation of percussion retouching techniques in Australian contexts, opening the possibility that uncommon objects—such as boomerangs—could be used for this task. This concept also highlights the broader topic of the highly diverse multipurpose application of many Indigenous tools throughout Australia. At the same time, the study reveals a deep functional connection between osseous and wooden objects—a topic rarely investigated in archaeological contexts."
https://openalex.org/W4291993980,"Managing indoor ozone levels is important because ozone is a hazardous pollutant that has adverse effects on human health. Coffee is a popular daily beverage, and thus, coffee beans and spent coffee grounds are common in many places such as offices, homes, aircraft, cafeterias, and such. The most common material used to remove ozone is activated carbon which can be made from coffee beans or spent coffee grounds with proper activation processes. This paper presents a novel idea: to remove ozone at the level of an indoor environment using unactivated coffee products. This paper examines the ozone removal efficiency and the ozone deposition velocity at 130 ppb ozone for two types of coffee: solid coffee (powder) and liquid coffee (beverage). The activated carbon, the deionized water, and the seawater are also included for comparison and validation purposes. The tests show that the fine coffee powder has a removal efficiency of 58.5% and a deposition velocity of 0.62 cm/s. The liquid coffee has a removal efficiency of 34.4% and a deposition velocity of 0.23 cm/s. The chemical inspections indicate that the oxidation reactions with the carbohydrates in solid coffee and the metal/mineral elements in liquid coffee are responsible for ozone removal. These results have confirmed that ozone removal via coffee is effective, controlling indoor air quality by coffee products is thus becoming possible."
https://openalex.org/W4292024575,"Background The Global Trigger Tool (GTT) has become a worldwide used method for estimating adverse events through a retrospective patient record review. However, little is known about the facilitators and the challenges in the GTT-implementation process. Thus, this study followed two aims: First, to apply a comprehensive set of feasibility criteria to qualitatively and systematically assess the GTT-implementation process in three departments of German university hospitals. Second, to identify the facilitators and the obstacles met in the GTT-implementation process and to derive recommendations for supporting other hospitals in implementing the GTT in clinical practice. Methods The study used a qualitative documentary method based on process documentation, with written and verbal feedback from the reviewer, as well as evaluating the study sites during the implementation process. The study was conducted in three departments, each in a different German university hospital. The authors applied a comprehensive set of 22 feasibility criteria assessing the level of challenge in GTT implementation. The results were synthesized and they focused on the facilitators and the challenges. Results Of these 22 feasibility criteria, nine were assessed as a low-level challenge, eleven regarded as a moderate-level challenge, and two with a problematic level of challenge. In particular, the lack of time and staff resources, the quality of the information in the patient records, organizational procedures, and local issues, posed major challenges in the implementation process. By contrast, the use of local coordinators and an external expert made important contributions to the GTT implementation. Conclusions Considering the facilitators and the obstacles beforehand may help with the implementation of the GTT in routine practice. In particular, early and effective planning can reduce or prevent critical challenges in terms of time, staff resources, and organizational aspects."
https://openalex.org/W4292112357,"Although the role of serine racemase (SR) in neuropsychiatric disorders has been extensively studied, its role in cell proliferation and differentiation remains unclear. Deletion of Srr, the encoding gene for SR, has been shown to reduce dendritic arborization and dendritic spine density in the brains of adult mice, whereas increased SR levels have been associated with differentiation in cell cultures. Previously, we demonstrated that valproic acid induces differentiation in the N2A neuroblastoma cell line, and that this differentiation is associated with increased SR expression. These observations suggest that SR may have a role in cell proliferation and differentiation. We herein found that both valproic acid and all-trans retinoic acid induced N2A differentiation. In contrast, knockdown of SR reduced levels of differentiation, increased N2A proliferation, promoted cell cycle entry, and modulated expression of cell cycle-related proteins. To further evaluate the effects of SR expression on cell proliferation and differentiation, we used an in vivo model of neuroblastoma in nude mice. N2A cells stably expressing scramble shRNA (Srrwt -N2A) or specific Srr shRNA (Srrkd -N2A) were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. The weights and volumes of Srrwt -N2A-derived tumors were lower than Srrkd -N2A-derived tumors. Furthermore, Srrwt -N2A-derived tumors were significantly mitigated by intraperitoneal injection of valproic acid, whereas Srrkd -N2A-derived tumors were unaffected. Taken together, our findings demonstrate for the first time that alterations in SR expression determine the transition between proliferation and differentiation in neural progenitor cells. Thus, in addition to its well-established roles in neuropsychiatric disorders, our study has highlighted a novel role for SR in cell proliferation and differentiation."

Recombinant HGF reduced MCAo-induced TNFα and IL1β expression, and alleviated perilesional reactivation of microglia and astrocyte. All of the aforementioned beneficial effects of HGF were antagonized by an inhibitor to the type II transmembrane serine protease matriptase (MTP). MCAo upregulated MTP mRNA and protein in the lesioned cortex. MTP protein, not the mRNA, was increased further by recombinant HGF but reduced when MTP inhibitor (MTPi) was added to the treatment. Changes of the endogenous active HGF by MCAo, HGF or MTPi paralleled with the changes of MTP protein under the same conditions whilst neither HGF mRNA nor the total endogenous HGF protein were altered. These data showed that the therapeutic effects of HGF in stroke brain is attributed to its proteolytic activation and that MTP is a main protease of the event. MCAo enhanced MTP mRNA and thus protein expression; the initial use of the recombinant active HGF stabilized MCAo-induced MTP protein and subsequent activation of endogenous latent HGF which in turn stabilized further MTP protein. A reciprocal regulation between MTP and HGF appears to be present where MTP promotes HGF activation and the active HGF prevents MTP protein turnover. This study, for the first time, shows that MTP can participate in neural protection in stroke brain through activation of HGF. The cycles of HGF-MTP regulation achieved preservation of the neurological activity."

The influence of rGO addition on kerf width is analysed in detail along with Pump pressure (bar), Transverse speed (mm/min) and Standoff distance(mm). The experiments are designed based on Taguchi’s orthogonal array techniques in which L27 is adopted for three input parameters at three levels. The influence of each factor is used to identify the significance of selected parameters over kerf width, and it was found that stand of distance has a major effect over kerf width irrespective of rGO %. The addition of rGO filler has a significant effect on kerf width, which decreases with the addition of rGO up to 0.2% and kerf width increases for further addition of rGO."
https://openalex.org/W4293063722,"Signed languages such as American Sign Language (ASL) rely on visuospatial information that combines hand and bodily movements, facial expressions, and fingerspelling. Signers communicate in a wide array of sub-optimal environments, such as in dim lighting or from a distance. While fingerspelling is a common and essential part of signed languages, the perception of fingerspelling in difficult visual environments is not well understood. The movement and spatial patterns of ASL are well-suited to representation by dynamic Point Light Display (PLD) stimuli in which human movement is shown as an array of moving dots affixed to joints on the body. We created PLD videos of fingerspelled location names. The location names were either Real (e.g., KUWAIT) or Pseudo-names (e.g., CLARTAND), and the PLDs showed either a High or a Low number of markers. In an online study, Deaf and Hearing ASL users (total N = 283) watched 27 PLD stimulus videos that varied by Word Type and Number of Markers. Participants watched the videos and typed the names they saw, along with how confident they were in their response. We predicted that when signers see ASL fingerspelling PLDs, language experience in ASL will be positively correlated with accuracy and self-rated confidence scores. We also predicted that Real location names would be understood better than Pseudo names. Our findings supported those predictions. We also discovered a significant interaction between Age and Word Type, which suggests that as people age, they use outside world knowledge to inform their fingerspelling success. Finally, we examined the accuracy and confidence in fingerspelling perception in early ASL users. Studying the relationship between language experience with PLD fingerspelling perception allows us to explore how hearing status, ASL fluency levels, and age of language acquisition affect the core abilities of understanding fingerspelling."

A standardized bioactive subfraction of the Malaysian herb, Strobilanthes crispus (L.) Blume ( S . crispus ) termed F3, demonstrates strong anticancer effects in both in vitro and in vivo models. The anticancer effects might be attributable to its immunomodulatory properties as S . crispus has been traditionally used to enhance the immune system. The current study examined whether F3 could stimulate anti-tumorigenic immunogenicity against 4T1 cells in vitro and in 4T1 cell-induced mammary carcinoma mouse model. We observed that F3 induced significant increase in MHC class I and class II molecules. CD4 + , CD8 + and IL-2 + ( p &lt;0.05 for all) cells infiltration was also significantly increased in the breast tumor microenvironment of F3-treated mice compared with the tumors of untreated mice. The number of CD68 + macrophages was significantly lower in F3-treated mice. We conclude that the antitumor and antimetastatic effects of S . crispus involve strong infiltration of T cells in breast cancer potentially through increased tumor antigen presentation via MHC proteins, as well as reduction of infiltrating tumor-associated macrophages."
