https://openalex.org/W1581717960,"This paper reports an investigation on the modulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MTP) by the membrane potential. Energized rat liver mitochondria loaded with a small Ca2+ pulse in sucrose medium supplemented with phosphate favor a high MTP closed probability because of the high membrane potential and therefore maintain a low permeability to sucrose. Upon depolarization by the addition of fully uncoupling concentrations of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) mitochondria favor a high MTP probability and rapidly undergo a process of osmotic swelling following sucrose diffusion toward the matrix. A titration with FCCP reveals that discrete subpopulations of mitochondria with different gating potentials for MTP opening may exist, since increasing concentrations of FCCP increase the fraction of mitochondria undergoing osmotic swelling. We show that physiological effectors (Ca2+, Mg2+, ADP, palmitate) modify pore opening in a mitochondrial population by shifting the fraction of mitochondria with a functionally open pore at any given membrane potential. Many inducers and inhibitors may therefore affect the pore directly through an effect on the MTP voltage sensing rather than indirectly through an effect on the membrane potential. Thus, many effectors may induce pore opening by shifting the MTP gating potential to higher levels, whereas many inhibitors may induce pore closure by shifting the MTP gating potential to lower levels."

https://openalex.org/W1480527955,"The promoter of the rat prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 (PGS-2) gene has recently been shown to confer gonadotropic hormone (follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), cAMP) inducibility when ligated to a CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) reporter gene and transfected into primary cultures of differentiated granulosa cells. To delineate cis-acting elements and trans-activating factors mediating this response, deletions of the active promoter region (-192/-53 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site) were tested for their ability to bind protein of granulosa cell nuclear extracts and activate reporter gene activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that the DNA subregion -142/-120 inhibited protein/DNA binding observed between granulosa cell nuclear extracts and the labeled PGS-2 fragment -192/-53. The subregion -142/-120 acting element C/EBP beta, 5‘-TTATGCAAT-3‘. Point mutations within the C/EBP beta element abolished protein/DNA binding and resulted in a 50% loss of forskolin/LH/FSH inducibility of reporter gene activity. C/EBP beta mRNA and protein were induced rapidly in granulosa cells in vivo by an ovulatory dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Collectively, these results indicate that C/EPB beta appears to play a key role in regulating induction of the PGS-2 gene in granulosa cells prior to ovulation."
https://openalex.org/W1519015673,"Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with bombesin caused a striking increase (21-fold) in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoskeleton-associated protein paxillin, as judged by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blots of anti-paxillin immunoprecipitates. Vasopressin and endothelin also stimulated paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation. Bombesin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was detectable within 1 min and was concentration-dependent (half-maximum effect at 0.09 nM). Bombesin stimulation of paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation could be dissociated from both protein kinase C (PKC) activation and the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Activation of PKC in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells using the tumor promoter phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in a time-dependent manner but was less effective than bombesin and stimulated detectable phosphorylation only within 5 min, considerably slower than bombesin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. Furthermore, the selective PKC inhibitor, GF109203X, or down-regulation of PKC using prolonged treatment with PDB markedly inhibited the stimulation of paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation by PDB but had little effect on the response to bombesin. In contrast, cytochalasin D, an agent that selectively disrupts the network of actin microfilaments, completely inhibited bombesin- and PDB-induced paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation. This is the first report to identify paxillin as a substrate for neuropeptide-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1536705765,"A growing body of evidence suggests that a variety of chronic diseases, including cancer and diabetes, are associated with damage to mitochondrial DNA. Since mitochondria are constantly exposed to high levels of reactive oxygen species, it is likely that oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA may be responsible for some of these maladies. To determine whether mitochondria can repair this damage, a quantitative Southern blot technique was utilized to identify repair in specific DNA fragments. A 10.8-kilobase mitochondrial restriction fragment was studied employing a probe containing the entire mouse mitochondrial genome. Alloxan was employed to generate oxygen radicals. Insulinoma cells were exposed to alloxan for 1 h, and total cellular DNA was isolated immediately or after intervals of up to 8 h. Alkali treatment was used to identify abasic sites and sugar lesions, endonuclease III was used to identify lesions associated with thymine and cytosine damage, and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase was employed to recognize formamidopyrimidines and 8-oxoguanines in DNA. The results showed that all forms of damage studied were repaired by 4 h, indicating that mitochondria are able to efficiently repair damage to their DNA caused by reactive oxygen species."

https://openalex.org/W1598208661,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae normally requires sphingolipid biosynthesis for growth; however, mutant strains lacking sphingolipids have been isolated by suppression of a genetic defect in sphingolipid long chain base biosynthesis. To begin to understand the nature of the suppressor(s) we isolated and characterized a suppressor gene, SLC1 (sphingolipid compensation). DNA sequence analysis showed that the wild type SLC1 allele differs from the suppressor allele by a single nucleotide which changes Gln-44 in the predicted wild type protein to Leu4-4 in the predicted SLC1-1 suppressor protein. The predicted SLC1 protein sequence is homologous to the 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase of Escherichia coli encoded by the plsC gene. The homology extends to function as well since the SLC1 gene complements the growth defect in an E. coli strain mutated in plsC. These results suggest that the SLC1 protein has a fatty acyltransferase activity. SLC1 thus may be the first eucaryotic sn2-acylglyceride fatty acyltransferase gene to be cloned. SLC strains grown in the absence of long chain base make novel phosphatidylinositol derivatives (Lester, R. L., Wells, G. B., Oxford, G., and Dickson, R. C. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 845-856) having a C26 fatty acid at the sn-2 position and the same polar head groups as normal sphingolipids. We postulate that the SLC1 suppressor allele encodes a variant enzyme with an altered substrate specificity that enables it to use a C26 in place of a C16/18 fatty acid precursor to acylate the sn-2 position of inositol-containing glycerolipids."
https://openalex.org/W1577941646,"Recent studies have suggested that the signal peptide-less cytokine, interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, may play a role as an intracellular regulator of human endothelial cell proliferation in vitro (Garfinkel, S., Haines, D. S., Brown, S., Wessendorf, J., Gillespie, D. H., and Maciag, T. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 24375-24378). In order to determine the intracellular locale of the IL-1 alpha precursor, we fused the open reading frame of the IL-1 alpha precursor to the reporter gene beta-galactosidase (Gal) and studied the cellular distribution of the chimera in NIH 3T3 cells after transfection. Immunological and enzymatic analysis demonstrated that the IL-1 alpha:beta-Gal fusion protein was associated with the nucleus. To further define the region responsible for this activity, we ligated the mature form of IL-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha 113-271) and the IL-1 alpha precursor domain (IL-1 alpha 1-112) to beta-Gal. Analysis of the intracellular distribution of these chimeric polypeptides following transfection demonstrated a differential distribution of IL-1 alpha 1-112:beta-Gal in the nucleus and IL-1 alpha 113-271:beta-Gal in the cytosol. Because the IL-1 alpha precursor domain contains a sequence that resembles a nuclear translocation signal (KVLKKRRL, residues 79-86), we prepared an IL-1 alpha precursor point mutant in which Lys82 was replaced by Glu. Transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with the IL-1 alpha precursor point mutant (IL-1 alpha 1-271 Glu82:beta-Gal) resulted in a significant reduction in the ability of the IL-1 alpha precursor to associate with the nucleus and similar data were obtained as a result of Lys82 mutagenesis in the IL-1 alpha precursor domain (IL-1 alpha 1-112 Glu82:beta-Gal). These data suggest that the IL-1 alpha precursor contains a functional nuclear localization sequence within the structure of the precursor domain and Lys82 is critical for its function."
https://openalex.org/W1546958121,"Proteins and RNAs homologous to components of the eukaryotic signal recognition particle (SRP) have been identified in a number of prokaryotic organisms. Here we report the isolation of an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA, FFC (fifty-four chloroplast homologue), that encodes a chloroplast protein (54CP) homologous to the 54-kDa subunit of the signal recognition particle. 54CP shares 27% identity with mammalian SRP54 and 44% identity with the Escherichia coli ffh gene product suggesting a prokaryotic origin for this gene. FFC is a nuclear gene encoding a 62-kDa cytoplasmically synthesized precursor that is capable of being imported into isolated chloroplasts and processed to a 53-kDa stromal polypeptide. Antibodies generated against a portion of 54CP recognize an endogenous 53-kDa chloroplast protein that sediments at 4 S and 70 S, the latter form may be associated with ribosomes. The FFC transcript is most abundant in green shoot tissue whereas etiolated buds and roots have transcript levels about 30 and 10%, respectively, relative to light grown green shoots. By analogy with the eukaryotic signal recognition particle which targets secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, it is speculated that 54CP may target chloroplast proteins to either the thylakoid or envelope membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1592650154,"The AH receptor is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates the biological effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. The AH receptor has primary sequence homology to its dimerization partner the AH receptor nuclear translocator, and to the Drosophila proteins Sim and Per. Characterization of the gene encoding the murine AH receptor (Ahr gene) reveals that its structural organization is also conserved with respect to the sim gene, since 6 of 11 Ahr exons are spliced at homologous sites. Interestingly, little splicing homology was observed between the Ahr and per genes. The promoter of the Ahr gene is GC-rich and contains no TATA or CCAAT boxes; however, sequence analysis has shown several binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 (GC boxes). Additionally we have identified a potential cAMP response element, AP-1 and E box sites, and two elements demonstrated in other genes to confer placenta-specific expression. Using a restriction fragment length polymorphism in exon 7 and recombinant inbred mouse lines, the Ahr gene was found to be concordant with the phenotypically defined Ahr locus, supporting the identity of these two genetic elements."

https://openalex.org/W1491482735,"Apolipoprotein (class A) amphipathic helixes are postulated to act as detergents by virtue of their cross-section being wedge-shaped. Using computer analysis of naturally occurring class A and lytic (class L) amphipathic helixes, we designed two archetypical model peptides. Analogs of these two peptides, incorporating substitutions or modifications of interfacial or basic residues, had the following effects. Class A peptides stabilized bilayer structure, reduced leakage from large unilamellar vesicles and erythrocytes, and inhibited lysis induced by class L peptides. Class L peptides destabilized bilayer structure in model membranes and increased binding of class A peptides to erythrocytes. The ability of class L analogs to lyse membranes and induce inverted lipid phases was reduced by either decreasing the bulk of an interfacial residue, increasing the angle subtended by the polar face, or increasing the bulk of the basic residues. The ability of the class A analog to stabilize bilayer structure and inhibit erythrocyte lysis by class L peptides was enhanced by methylating the Lys residues. These results can be explained by a model that we term the reciprocal wedge hypothesis. By analogy to the reciprocal effects of phospholipid shapes on membrane structure, we propose that the wedge shape of class A helixes stabilizes membrane bilayers, whereas the inverted wedge shape of class L helixes destabilizes membrane bilayers, and, thus, one class will neutralize the effect of the other class on membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1631575592,"We have shown that culturing HepG2 cells in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with calf serum, dexamethasone, and triiodothyronine causes an increase in the insulin sensitivity and responsiveness for glucose incorporation into glycogen. This correlates with increased expression of the mRNA encoding the B isoform of the insulin receptor. Of all the components in the medium, we found that dexamethasone exerted the greatest effect. Dexamethasone alone could cause both a switch in expression from the A to the B isoform of the insulin receptor and also an increase in insulin sensitivity for both glucose incorporation into glycogen and 2-deoxyglucose transport. In addition, we found that expression of the B isoform of the insulin receptor is developmentally regulated in the 3T3-L1 adipocyte leading to the suggestion that the alternatively spliced B isoform of the insulin receptor may play an important role in signal transduction in insulin target tissues such as liver, fat, and muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1573350038,"The purpose of this study was to determine if the alpha 3 beta 1 integrin could interact in a homophilic manner. Several earlier reports have shown that certain integrin adhesion receptors, namely alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 3 beta 1, and alpha 6 beta 4 localize to intercellular adhesion structures and, therefore, may participate in cell-cell interactions (Carter, W. G., Wayner, E. A., Bouchard, T. S., and Kaur, P. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 110, 1387-1404; Kaufmann, R., Frosch, D., Westphal, C., Weber, L., and Klein, C. E. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 109, 1807-1815; Hynes, R. O. (1987) Cell 48, 549-554; Symington, B. E., Takada, Y., and Carter, W. G. (1993) J. Cell Biol. 120, 523-535). We present data herein suggesting that the integrin alpha 3 beta 1 may interact homophilically in such cell-cell adhesion structures which contain this specific receptor or, alternatively, in receptor aggregates found in focal adhesions. The alpha 3 beta 1 receptor was purified by affinity chromatography on either human laminin or peptide GD-6-Sepharose and subsequently used as a substrate in cell adhesion assays. The immobilized alpha 3 beta 1 supported the adhesion of cells containing alpha 3 beta 1, and this attachment was specifically inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to both beta 1 and alpha 3 subunits. In addition, an affinity matrix containing purified alpha 3 beta 1 showed specific binding of only alpha 3 beta 1 from detergent extracts of cell surface proteins and such binding was cation-dependent. Finally, using biosensor technology involving the principle of surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore, Pharmacia Biosensor), alpha 3 beta 1, when bound to a carboxymethyl dextran-modified gold surface, was found to bind only other soluble alpha 3 beta 1 receptors and did not bind other purified integrins, including alpha 5 beta 1 and alpha v beta 3. These data strongly suggest that alpha 3 beta 1 likely interacts in a homophilic manner under our experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1519774322,"Chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase, which transfers sulfate from 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate to position 6 of N-acetylgalactosamine in chondroitin, was purified 1,430-fold to apparent homogeneity with a 22% yield from the serum-free culture medium of chick embryo chondrocytes by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, wheat germ agglutinin-agarose, and 3',5'-ADP-agarose. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme showed a single broad protein band with an apparent molecular weight of 75,000. Since the purified enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of 160,000 as judged by gel chromatography on Superose 12, the active form of chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase may be a dimer. The purified enzyme transferred sulfate to chondroitin, chondroitin sulfate, and corneal keratan sulfate. Chondroitin sulfate E from squid cartilage, dermatan, sulfate, and heparan sulfate hardly served as acceptors of the sulfotransferase. The sulfated product derived from keratan sulfate was degraded by keratanase but not by chondroitinase ABC."
https://openalex.org/W1673043020,"A calcium-dependent ceramide (Cer) kinase was recently detected in human leukemia (HL-60) cells (Kolesnick, R.N., and Hemer, M.R. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 18803-18808) where it may function in terminating the regulatory effects of Cer, and in synaptic vesicles (Bajjalieh, S. M., Martin, T. F. J., and Floor, E. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 14354-14360). We now demonstrate that the addition of both Cer-1-phosphate (Cer-1-P) and a short-acyl chain analog of Cer-1-P,N-hexanoylsphingosine-1-phosphate (C6-Cer-1-P) to cultured cells and a variety of subcellular fractions results in rapid degradation to Cer and C6-Cer, respectively. The Cer-1-P phosphatase activity is enriched in a rat liver plasma membrane fraction and appears to be distinct from the phosphatase that hydrolyzes phosphatidic acid (PA), PA phosphohydrolase, as shown by the difference in sensitivity of Cer-1-P and PA hydrolysis to propranolol, detergent, and heat treatment. Moreover, the Km of Cer-1-P hydrolysis is 10-fold lower than the Km of PA hydrolysis in plasma membrane. PA is a noncompetitive inhibitor of Cer-1-P hydrolysis, with an inhibition constant 1-1.5-fold higher than the Km of Cer-1-P hydrolysis. In contrast, Cer-1-P does not inhibit PA hydrolysis. Finally, we describe the synthesis of a novel analog of Cer-1-P which is not hydrolyzed in vitro and in vivo and is internalized in cultured cells by endocytosis. These results are discussed in relation to the possible roles of Cer-1-P in regulating intracellular levels of Cer."
https://openalex.org/W1510812989,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident protein, ER60, is a member of the protein disulfide-isomerase family and contains two copies of the internal thioredoxin motif, CGHC. Previously, ER60 was identified as a cysteine protease and named ER-60 protease (Urade, R., Nasu, M., Moriyama, T., Wada, K., and Kito, M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 15152-15159; Urade, R., and Kito, M. (1992) FEBS Lett. 312, 83-86). Here, ERp72, the other member of the protein disulfide-isomerase family containing three CGHC motifs, was isolated from ER of rat and mouse livers through four sequential chromatographies on DEAE-Toyopearl 650, AF-heparin Toyopearl 650M, and TSK gel G3000SW twice. The purified rat protein was found to be homogeneous on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, not being contaminated by ER-60 protease, as judged on immunoblot analysis using an anti-ER-60 protease antibody. The partial amino acid sequence of rat ERp72 was 93% homologous to that of mouse ERp72. The purified rat ERp72 degraded other ER resident proteins such as protein disulfide-isomerase and calreticulin. The purified mouse ERp72 also degraded those proteins. Though rat ERp72 did not basically require Ca2+ for the reaction, the degradation of protein disulfide-isomerase was enhanced, but the degradation of calreticulin was inhibited in the presence of Ca2+. The proteolytic activity of rat ERp72 was inhibited by cysteine protease inhibitors. Its sensitivity to protease inhibitors was the same as that of ER-60 protease. In addition, the proteolytic activity of rat ERp72 was inhibited by acidic phospholipids, also similar to ER-60 protease. Therefore, we propose that ERp72 be named ER-72 protease."
https://openalex.org/W1589976671,"The activity and the complete primary structure of gilatoxin, a glycoprotein component from the venom of the Mexican beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum horridum) has been elucidated. Gilatoxin, a serine protease, showed kallikrein-like activity, releasing bradykinin from kininogen; toxin-treated kininogen also produced lowered blood pressure in rats and contraction of isolated rat uterus smooth muscle. Gilatoxin catalyzed the hydrolysis of various arginine ester substrates for trypsin and thrombin and degraded both angiotensin I and II by cleavage of the dipeptide Asp-Arg from the NH2-terminal end. Fibrinogen was degraded but a fibrin clot was not produced, indicating that gilatoxin has specificities different from thrombin and snake venom thrombin-like proteases. The complete amino acid sequence of gilatoxin (245 residues) was deduced from NH2-terminal sequencing of overlapping peptide fragments cleaved from the reduced and alkylated toxin by enzymatic and chemical methods. The toxin is extensively glycosylated, containing approximately 8 mol of monosaccharide/mol of toxin, but appears to lack O-glycosylation sites. Amino acid sequence alignment of gilatoxin with batroxobin, crotalase, kallikrein, thrombin, trypsin, and several partial sequences of other Heloderma toxins reveals that there is considerable homology between these enzymes, particularly in the regions of the presumed catalytic site. Gilatoxin contains an additional 7 residues in the highly conserved catalytic region of serine proteases (including Asp-96, in the basic specificity pocket of thrombin) which may contribute to the unusual substrate specificity of the toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1547138024,"The roles of the glucose transporter isoforms, GLUT1 and GLUT4, in mediating insulin-stimulated glucose transport were investigated by stably overexpressing the transporters in L6 myoblasts. Levels of GLUT1 and GLUT4 in myoblasts from the cell lines having the highest content of these transporters were approximately 16- and 30-fold higher, respectively, than levels in nontransfected cells. The basal rate of 2-deoxy[3H]glucose uptake was severalfold higher in cells overexpressing GLUT1 than in the parent L6 myoblasts or in control cell lines that were generated by transfecting cells with expression vectors lacking transporter insert. The basal rate was not elevated in any of the lines expressing GLUT4. The net increase in 2-deoxy[3H]glucose uptake produced by insulin was larger in both the GLUT1 and GLUT4 cells than in the control cells. Insulin increased uptake in GLUT4 cells by as much as 6-fold; whereas, the fold increase over basal uptake produced by insulin in GLUT1 cells was comparable to that (2-fold) observed in the control myocytes. Thus, both GLUT1 and GLUT4 can mediate insulin-stimulated glucose transport in L6 myoblasts, although GLUT4 is needed to observe large percentage increases comparable to those observed in skeletal muscle fibers in vivo. In contrast to insulin, the protein phosphatase inhibitors, okadaic acid and calyculin A, inhibited glucose transport in cells expressing either GLUT1 or GLUT4. Calyculin A, which produced a half-maximum effect at 10 nM, was approximately 100 times more potent than okadaic acid in decreasing both basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Inhibition of uptake by calyculin A was associated with a decrease in the cell surface concentration of both GLUT1 and GLUT4. These results indicate that increased protein phosphorylation can lead to inhibition of transport mediated by both GLUT1 and GLUT4."
https://openalex.org/W1537465580,"The human alpha 1 glycine receptor (GlyR) was expressed in Sf9 insect cells infected with a recombinant Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis baculovirus. Previous studies had indicated that transient expression of this subunit in Xenopus oocytes or human kidney cell lines is sufficient to form active agonist-gated chloride channels. Expression of the alpha 1 GlyR protein resulted in functional channels present on the cell surface of infected Sf9 cells as evidenced by whole-cell patch-clamping and single-channel recordings. These channels were gated by glycine, but not in the presence of strychnine. An immunoreactive 48-kDa protein could be easily visualized on Coomassie-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of whole-cell lysates with maximal expression 3 days postinfection. The alpha 1 GlyR protein was solubilized from a membrane fraction of infected Sf9 cells in 1% digitonin and 0.1% deoxycholate and purified by affinity chromatography using aminostrychnine agarose, yielding 0.33 mg/liter of cells. Given the low natural abundance of the native channel, the development of this expression system now provides sufficient purified channel protein for future biochemical and biophysical characterization. Since the glycine receptor shares sequence and structural homology with other members of a ligand-gated channel superfamily, further characterization may establish general rules governing the structure and mechanism of these membrane protein channels."
https://openalex.org/W1491227978,"The murine macrophage cell line, P388D1, was transfected with expression plasmids containing a cDNA for the precursor or mature form of human interleukin (IL)-1 alpha or -1 beta, and the extent of IL-1 protein secretion was analyzed. The secretion of IL-1 beta from cells transfected with a cDNA encoding the mature IL-1 beta was approximately 15-fold greater than from cells transfected with a precursor IL-1 beta cDNA. Although P388D1 cells transfected with precursor and mature IL-1 alpha cDNAs exhibited similar levels of secretion, the precursor IL-1 alpha cDNA-transfected cells secreted only the mature form of IL-1 alpha. Relatively high levels of IL-1 secretion were also observed in cultures of HeLa cells and the murine EL 4 and human Jurkat T cell lines that were transfected with a mature IL-1 alpha or -beta expression plasmid. Secretion was not observed when these cell lines were transfected with precursor IL-1 alpha or -beta expression plasmids. Secretion was also minimal when P388D1 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding mature IL-1 beta proteins lacking the NH2- or COOH-terminal 20 amino acids. These results indicate that the mature forms of IL-1 proteins are the preferred substrates for secretion and that the maintenance of a specific conformation of these proteins may be required for optimal secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1495452640,"The high affinity IgE Fc receptor (Fc epsilon RI), found on mast cells and basophils, is a tetrameric receptor complex. The extracellular portion of the Fc epsilon RI alpha subunit consists of two immunoglobulin-like domains and binds IgE in the absence of the other subunits. To localize the high affinity IgE binding site within the Fc epsilon RI alpha subunit, we generated a series of chimeric receptor constructs where one of the two immunoglobulin-like domains was either deleted or substituted with those from the human Fc gamma RIIIA alpha or the rat Fc epsilon RI alpha subunit. The chimeric receptors were monitored for their capacity to bind human and rat IgE, and their reactivity with different antireceptor antibodies. Domain I substitutions maintained high affinity human IgE binding. Domain II substitutions resulted in a total loss of both human and rat IgE binding. Single-domain alpha subunits could not bind IgE, suggesting that both extracellular domains are required for proper protein folding or IgE binding. To further localize the IgE binding sites, homolog-scanning mutagenesis was performed. At least three independent regions of domain II encompassing residues 118-129, 136-150, and 148-162 were required for IgE binding. Our results suggest that domain II of the human Fc epsilon RI alpha confers most of the important contributions to the binding of the human IgE Fc molecule, whereas domain I of the rat Fc epsilon RI alpha makes important contributions to the binding of rat IgE."
https://openalex.org/W1494698999,"In order to investigate the relationships between the three-dimensional structure and the enzymic activity of E. coli RNase HI, three mutant proteins, which were completely inactivated by the replacements of three functional residues, Asp10 by Asn (D10N), Glu48 by Gln (E48Q), and Asp70 by Asn (D70N), were crystallized. Their three-dimensional structures were determined by x-ray crystallography. Although the entire backbone structures of these mutants were not affected by the replacements, very localized conformational changes were observed around the Mg(2+)-binding site. The substitution of an amide group for a negatively charged carboxyl group in common induces the formation of new hydrogen bond networks, presumably due to the cancellation of repulsive forces between carboxyl side chains with negative charges. These conformational changes can account for the loss of the enzymic activity in the mutants, and suggest a possible role for Mg2+ in the hydrolysis. Since the 3 replaced acidic residues are completely conserved in sequences of reverse transcriptases from retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, the concepts of the catalytic mechanism deduced from this structural analysis can also be applied to RNase H activity in reverse transcriptases."
https://openalex.org/W1495106960,"We found that a rat testis cDNA library contained two types of proenkephalin cDNA, corresponding to somatic and germ cell-specific transcripts. The somatic form is identical in primary sequence to previously characterized transcripts from rat brain and heart. The longer germ cell-specific cDNA contains a novel 5' terminus derived from the somatic intron A. We found that germ cell-specific transcripts translate in vitro with significantly lower efficiency than do somatic-type transcripts. Deletion analysis indicated that translational inefficiency is mediated primarily by the presence of four upstream AUG codons followed by short open reading frames within the leader sequence. Secondary structure in the form of a stem-and-loop upstream of the initiator codon for proenkephalin was found to have a slightly inhibitory effect on translation. These results, coupled with the very low abundance of the somatic transcript, provide a possible explanation for the low levels of opioid peptides found in adult rat testis in spite of the abundant quantity of germ cell-specific proenkephalin transcript."
https://openalex.org/W1593708032,"The importance of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and its five autophosphorylation sites in the in vivo interaction and tyrosine phosphorylation of the ras GTPase-activating protein (rasGAP) has been investigated, using NIH 3T3 cells transfected with mutant EGF receptors. Phosphorylation of rasGAP by EGF receptor mutants, in which one to four autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1173, -1148, -1086, and -1068) were mutated to phenylalanine, was reduced by 50-60% compared to the wild-type receptor. Elimination of these four autophosphorylation sites by truncation of 123 carboxyl-terminal residues of the EGF receptor paralleled results obtained with point mutants. Substantial inhibition (about 90%) of rasGAP tyrosine phosphorylation by the EGF receptor occurred only when the remaining autophosphorylation site (Tyr-992) was mutated, in the context of this truncated receptor or in the full-length receptor mutated at all four other autophosphorylation sites. However, a point mutation of only Tyr-992 in the full-length receptor suppressed tyrosine phosphorylation of rasGAP only by 50%. In contrast, an EGF receptor lacking the last 214 amino acid residues (Dc214), which encompasses all five autophosphorylation sites, phosphorylated rasGAP to the same extent as the wild-type receptor. However, this truncated receptor was significantly impaired in its capacity to phosphorylate phospholipase C-gamma 1. Interestingly, while EGF receptor autophosphorylation sites are required for EGF-induced rasGAP association with the receptor, maximal phosphorylation of rasGAP by the truncated receptor Dc214 occurred without detectable formation of receptor-rasGAP complexes. Furthermore, the capacity of mutated EGF receptors to bring about focal transformation was correlated with their capacity to phosphorylate rasGAP."
https://openalex.org/W1487304679,"In cultured hepatoma HepG2 cells, serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) is secreted more rapidly in the presence of retinol than in its absence (Tosetti, F., Ferrari, N., Pfeffer, U., Brigati, C., and Vidali, G. (1992) Exp. Cell Res. 200, 467-472). In the presence of millimolar concentration of DTT, HepG2 cells synthesize fully reduced RBP within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which, upon removal of DTT, forms disulfide bonds post-translationally. Secretion of this post-translationally folded RBP is also dependent on the presence of retinol. Using nonreducing gel electrophoresis, we resolved disulfide-bonded RBP folding intermediates. In addition, two other intracellular folding intermediates, compact I and II, which co-migrate with mature RBP were resolved by their different sensitivity to DTT-induced unfolding. Retinol, as well as retinoic acid, stabilized both compact I and II RBP intermediates to DTT-induced unfolding, suggesting that RBP assumes different conformations in the ER in the presence and absence of a ligand. However, only RBP synthesized in the presence of retinol is rapidly secreted, indicating that the ER export quality control system recognizes RBP containing retinol, but not retinoic acid, as fully folded and competent for export. Folding of RBP so that it is stabilized to DTT reduction is not a sufficient condition for ER exit."
https://openalex.org/W1527184329,"We have used enzymic cleavage by trypsin in conjunction with glycosidase digestion to probe the transmembrane topologies and molecular structures of mammalian equilibrative, nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR)-sensitive, nucleoside transport systems. Transporters from four species (human, pig, guinea pig, and rat) and three tissues (erythrocyte, liver, and lung), which differ from each other in size and in their sensitivity to inhibition by the vasodilator dipyridamole, were investigated. Broadly equivalent sites of [3H]NBMPR photolabeling, carbohydrate attachment, and trypsin cleavage were observed for all systems. Results from these experiments demonstrate that molecular weight differences between rat transporters and those from two other species (human and guinea pig) are due largely to oligosaccharide heterogeneity and that the low dipyridamole sensitivity of rat nucleoside transporters is probably a consequence of relatively minor differences in molecular structure. In marked contrast, carbohydrate removal increases the molecular weight difference between the pig erythrocyte transporter and, for example, that in human erythrocytes. This polypeptide difference is limited largely, if not completely, to one tryptic fragment of the protein. In the case of the human erythrocyte transporter, the site of N-linked glycosylation has been located very close to one end of the protein, and the site of NBMPR photolabeling to within 16 kDa of that site. Trypsin cleavage occurs endofacially. Our results provide evidence of substantial structural conservation among mammalian NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transporters."
https://openalex.org/W1493462141,"Cassette mutagenesis was used to analyze the effects of mutations at amino acid positions 107-120 in cytochrome P450 2C2 which are part of a predicted substrate recognition site, SRS-1 (Gotoh, O. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 83-90), and terminate with a highly conserved tryptophan. All the mutant enzymes were expressed in COS1 cells at approximately the same level as wild type as determined by immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled products. Substitutions of amino acids from 107 to 110 and from 116 to 119 resulted in mutant enzymes that retained substantial lauric acid hydroxylase activity suggesting that these residues are not critical determinants of substrate specificity. In contrast, amino acids 112-115 were characterized by strong decreases in activity in at least one mutation tested. A substitution of phenylalanine for valine 112 reduced activity about 3-fold. At position 113, substitution of leucine for isoleucine had little effect, but activity was reduced 15-fold by substitution with cysteine. A conservative mutation at position 114 reduced activity 5-fold, a nonconservative mutation at position 115 resulted in a 30-fold reduction of lauric acid hydroxylation. Substitution of glutamic acid for glycine at position 109 had little effect on activity, while more conservative substitutions of valine for glycines at positions 111 and 117 resulted in about 50- and 7-fold reductions of activity, respectively. Substitution of leucine for tryptophan 120 resulted in a 7-fold reduction of activity indicating that tryptophan at this position contributes to, but is not essential for, enzymatic activity in spite of its presence in nearly all eukaryotic cytochromes P450. The results are consistent with a model in which amino acids 112-114, and possibly 115, align with a loop of bacterial P450cam sequence containing substrate contacting amino acids, tyrosine 96 and phenylalanine 98. Glycines at either end of the loop in cytochrome P450 2C2 appear to be critical for activity."
https://openalex.org/W1548138800,"Three forms of interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been constructed and stably transfected into human hepatoma cells (HepG2). Wild type IL-6 containing a signal peptide was rapidly secreted as a biologically active protein. IL-6 lacking the signal peptide accumulated within the cytoplasm of transfected cells. Surprisingly, IL-6 carrying a COOH-terminal extension of the amino acids Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) was not completely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Complete retention in the ER was achieved when the 14 COOH-terminal amino acids of protein disulfide isomerase which include the KDEL signal were added to the COOH terminus of IL-6. This finding clearly demonstrates that the addition of the protein sorting signal KDEL alone is not sufficient for full retention of IL-6 in the ER. IL-6 accumulated in the cytoplasm and IL-6 retained in the ER failed to induce liver-specific acute-phase protein synthesis in the host cells, indicating that there is no intracellular role for IL-6 in signal transduction. Retention of IL-6 in the ER led to the prevention of surface expression of the IL-6 receptor protein gp80, making these cells unresponsive to IL-6. This phenomenon can be exploited in the future to generate transgenic animals which will become completely cytokine unresponsive in the tissues in which they express an ER retained cytokine."
https://openalex.org/W1573797395,"We investigated the process interrupting the production of a temperature-sensitive mutant strain of Sendai virus, Cl.151, at the nonpermissive temperature (38 degrees C). The amount of virus M protein increased up to 6-fold when the cells persistently infected with Cl.151 strain at 38 degrees C are transferred to 32 degrees C, while the amount of nucleocapsid proteins did not alter. Cl.151 strain could restore virus production at 38 degrees C not only by the supplementation of M protein of wild type (Z) strain but also by the supplementation of M protein of Cl.151 strain. Neither the amount of M mRNA nor the rate of synthesis of M protein was altered by temperature in cells infected with the Cl.151 strain. However, we found that M protein of Cl.151 virus, which has 3-amino acid alterations from the wild type, was highly unstable at 38 degrees C when expressed under the control of an actin promoter. These results clearly show that Sendai virus M protein has a critical role in the production of virus particles without affecting virus gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1515796377,"Abstract Poly-N-acetyllactosamine (PL) sequences (repeating (3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1)n) in complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides often occur in branched tri- and tetraantennary chains containing alpha-linked mannosyl residues disubstituted by N-acetyllactosaminyl units at C-2 and C-6 (2,6-branched mannose). We report here our studies on the factors affecting PL biosynthesis and the branching of N-linked oligosaccharides in glycoproteins from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. For our studies, we utilized a mutant CHO cell line designated Lec8 CHO, which lacks the ability to galactosylate its glycoproteins and consequently synthesizes glycoproteins containing terminal GlcNAc residues and lacking poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine and sialic acid. Glycoproteins in extracts of [3H]glucosamine- or [3H]mannose-labeled Lec8 CHO cells were galactosylated by exogenous beta 1-4-galactosyltransferase and analyzed by chromatography on leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin-Sepharose, a lectin reactive with glycoproteins containing 2,6-branched mannosyl residues. Approximately 10% of the radiolabeled glycoproteins were bound, and these were primarily of high molecular mass. Structural analyses of the bound glycoproteins demonstrated that they quantitatively contained 2,6-branched mannose. We then determined whether the small i N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase (iGNT), which initiates PL biosynthesis, could specifically recognize glycoproteins in vitro and whether recognition was dependent on the presence of 2,6-branched mannose. When the galactosylated glycoproteins in extracts of Lec8 CHO cells were incubated with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, the endogenous iGNT quantitatively added GlcNAc in beta 1-3-linkage to terminal galactosyl residues in the leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin-bound glycoproteins. These results demonstrate for the first time that 2,6-branched mannosyl residues are restricted to a subset of CHO glycoproteins and that the iGNT in vitro preferentially recognizes glycoproteins containing the 2,6-branched mannose determinant."

https://openalex.org/W2098210746,"To identify inducible protein kinases localized exclusively in the nucleus, nuclear and cytosolic extracts were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted to an Immobilon-P membranes were incubated in phosphorylation buffer containing [gamma-32P]ATP. Autoradiographs of the membranes revealed an 85-kDa 32P-labeled band; the intensity of this band was transiently increased in nuclear but not in cytosolic extracts from interleukin-1 alpha-treated cells. Incorporation of 32P label into a blotted protein band suggested the presence of an interleukin-1 alpha-responsive 85-kDa nuclear protein kinase. Fractionation of nuclear extracts by Mono Q failed to separate the kinase activity from the substrate, indicating that the 85-kDa band identified on the Immobilon-P membrane represents a protein kinase that undergoes autophosphorylation. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the 85-kDa band showed that this enzyme is a serine/threonine kinase. Purified pp90RSK could not be identified by the denaturation-renaturation method, indicating that the 85-kDa kinase identified here is not pp90RSK. This observation, nuclear but not cytoplasmic localization, and the fact that antibodies to known protein kinases kinase failed to recognize it suggest that the enzyme identified here is a novel protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1604325815,"HepG2 cells in the presence of DTT synthesize fully reduced serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Upon removal of DTT, RBP forms disulfide bonds and a folding intermediate, compact II, accumulates within the ER. Compact II RBP co-migrates on nonreducing gel electrophoresis with the secreted form of RBP but is differentiated from secreted RBP by its sensitivity to DTT-induced unfolding (see accompanying article; Kaji, E. H., and Lodish, H. F. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22188-22194). Here, we have reconstituted DTT-induced unfolding of compact II RBP in a broken cell system and demonstrate that ER-associated factors enhance the unfolding of RBP by DTT. Protein disulfide isomerase is likely to be one such factor since it enhances the rate of RBP unfolding by DTT in vitro; protein disulfide isomerase-induced unfolding requires the absence of retinoids, similar to the DTT-induced unfolding in vivo. ATP enhances the unfolding of RBP in the absence but not in the presence of retinol, both in intact and broken cells. Thus, protein disulfide isomerase and other ATP-dependent factors can unfold partly folded (or misfolded) RBP in the ER, suggesting how improperly folded proteins might be correctly refolded in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1498176601,"Binding sites for SL3-3 enhancer factor 1 (SEF1) are important for the transcriptional activity in T lymphocytes and the tumorigenicity of SL3-3 murine leukemia virus. SEF1 is also implicated in the activity of many other leukemia, lymphoma, and sarcoma virus enhancers, and enhancers of genes for T cell receptor-CD3 subunits. We have purified several proteins binding to SEF1 sites from bovine thymus using a five-step purification procedure. The proteins migrated as 19 distinct bands representing molecular masses from 23 kDa to about 200 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Ten DNA binding proteins, with molecular masses between 23 and 67 kDa, could be isolated after separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The DNA binding specificities of these proteins were similar and corresponded to that of the SEF1 binding activity in nuclear extracts. Each of these isolated SEF1 proteins also bound to the essential delta-E3 element of the human T cell receptor delta enhancer. Antibodies against one SEF1 protein only reacted with the protein used for immunization, which indicates a limited homology between at least some SEF1 proteins. We also present data suggesting that SEF1 proteins exist in multiple forms with differences in their DNA binding specificity, and that high affinity DNA binding of the SEF1 proteins requires protein phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1492833585,"The magnesium ion in bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase can be depleted up to 75% by heat treatment of the enzyme at 43 degrees C followed by dialysis against EDTA buffer solution. The magnesium-depleted enzyme so obtained retains 40% of the activity of the native enzyme. This is the first attempt to deplete magnesium ion from bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase without denaturation of the protein. Magnesium depletion exposes at least one carboxyl group on subunit IV for labeling by N-cyclohexyl-N'-(4-dimethylaminonaphthyl)carbodiimide (NCD-4). The NCD-4 labeling of subunit IV of the magnesium-depleted enzyme is significantly enhanced relative to what is observed for the native and heat-treated oxidase, suggesting that the magnesium ion is located in subunit IV with at least one carboxyl ligand. By comparing the activity of the magnesium-depleted enzyme with that of a control sample of heat-treated oxidase, the influence of divalent magnesium on the activity of the enzyme is assessed."
https://openalex.org/W1579447040,"Saturation mutagenesis of the mature human interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) gene has been performed. Following expression in Escherichia coli, the biological and receptor binding activities of the mutant proteins were examined. Most of the molecule could be altered with little effect on either function. More than 3,500 mutants were examined, and only 23 unique amino acid sequences were identified which resulted in an altered ratio of biological to binding activity when compared with wild-type IL-1 alpha. These proteins possessed mutations at 38 of the 159 amino acid residues in IL-1 alpha. Random mutagenesis at several of these positions identified further substitutions that affected activity. Examination of a model for IL-1 alpha localized most of the residues which altered activity along one face of the molecule. This region appears to be distinct from areas of IL-1 which have been postulated to make contact with IL-1 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1517908976,"The pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs), which are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, are the major pregnancy-associated proteins synthesized by the human placenta. Thirty or more PSG members have been identified which are encoded by at least 11 linked genes. The PSG proteins share 85-95% sequence homology in the coding region, but show variability at the carboxyl-terminal (COOH) domains. In the present study, we examined the effects of PSG COOH domains on protein secretion and stability. Using PSGs containing short (11-12 residues) hydrophilic (PSG1e, PSG11s, and PSG16a), short (22 residues) hydrophobic (PSG6r), and long (81 residues) hydrophobic (PSG11w) COOH domains, we showed that most PSG members were secretory proteins except PSG11w which was largely retained in cells. When the PSG11w COOH domain was replaced with a short COOH domain of PSG1e, the resulting PSG-N11w/C1e chimera became secreted into the medium. On the other hand, chimeras that harbored the PSG11w COOH domain, PSG-N1e/C11w and PSG-N16a/C11w, remained in cells, demonstrating that the COOH domain of PSG11w confers intracellular retention. Deletion analysis showed that mutant (PSG11w-C2) that contained the first 21 amino acids of PSG11w COOH domain or mutant (PSG11w-C3) that contained a deletion of hydrophobic residues 372-392 in the PSG11w COOH domain remained largely in cells. In contrast, the PSG11w-C1 mutant which contained the first 12 residues of the PSG11w COOH domain became a secretory protein. Studies of PSG synthesis and processing in the presence of Brefeldin A, a drug that impedes protein transport from endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi system, showed that PSG11w resided and degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum localization of PSG11w and the cell-associated mutant PSGs was further demonstrated by their sensitivity to endoglycosidase H and indirect immunofluorescence analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1554160025,"Transcription complexes of simian virus 40 can be isolated from cells late in infection in a form that retains the ability to continue transcription in vitro. These complexes have been investigated previously to gain information about the nucleoprotein structure of a transcribing gene. However, several studies have reported that the RNA polymerase molecules in such complexes are located almost entirely at the 5' end of the transcription unit. This would indicate that these complexes cannot be those which were in the process of transcribing mRNA in the cell, because the transcribing complexes would be expected to contain polymerase that were distributed throughout the transcription unit at the time of extraction. Since this issue is important to the interpretation of studies which characterize the extracted complexes, we have determined the polymerase locations using two new approaches. The first employs a new application of a procedure in which the transcription complex DNA is radioactively tagged by transcription in vitro. The second is a new method, which analyzes run-off transcripts generated in vitro. Both methods demonstrate that the polymerases are distributed throughout the genome in the transcription complexes. This result indicates that these complexes were in the process of transcribing mRNA at the time of cell lysis."
https://openalex.org/W1532508263,"To investigate the mechanism by which a 5' splice site (D1) is selected, while a nearby potentially functional site (Dcr1) is silenced, we have studied the importance of the 9-nucleotide sequence of these 5' splice sites for their respective usage. Our model system uses a transcript derived from the early transcription unit 3 of adenovirus-2. Transcripts, harboring an exonic element previously shown to be required for the selection of D1 in the presence of Dcr1, were mutated in the D1 and Dcr1 sequences and assayed for splicing in vitro. We first show that an increased ability of D1 to pair with U1 small nuclear (sn) RNA correlates with an increased accumulation of splicing intermediates, independently of the presence of Dcr1. This variation of efficiency of the first splicing reaction does not significantly affect the overall splicing efficiency except when the potential D1-U1 snRNA hybrid is less than 6 base pairs. Equally, the selector activity of the upstream exon element requires a D1 sequence that is able to form hybrids of 6 base pairs or more with U1 snRNA. This indicates that the cis-acting selector of D1 includes the exonic element (a potential stem-loop structure) and a D1 sequence of sufficient strength."
