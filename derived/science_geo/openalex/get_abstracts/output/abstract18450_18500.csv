https://openalex.org/W2038574124,"There are three possible outcomes when a T cell recognizes a cell bearing a self or foreign antigen. (i) The T cell is not sufficiently signaled and is unaffected. (ii) The T cell is activated. (iii) The T cell is turned off. The differentiation state of the T cell is critical to the outcome. Although both virgin and memory T cells can be activated by antigens presented by ""professional"" antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, they differ in their responses to B cells. Experienced T cells respond to antigen presented by B cells, whereas virgin T cells are rendered tolerant. These findings may relate to the phenomena of low- and high-zone tolerance, neonatal tolerance, and the beneficial effect of blood transfusions on allograft survival."
https://openalex.org/W2088831705,"Linkage analysis of ten Utah kindreds and one Texas kindred with multiple cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) provided evidence that a locus for familial melanoma susceptibility is in the chromosomal region 9p13-p22. The genetic markers analyzed reside in a candidate region on chromosome 9p21, previously implicated by the presence of homozygous deletions in melanoma tumors and by the presence of a germline deletion in an individual with eight independent melanomas. Multipoint linkage analysis was performed between the familial melanoma susceptibility locus (MLM) and two short tandem repeat markers, D9S126 and the interferon-alpha (IFNA) gene, which reside in the region of somatic loss in melanoma tumors. An analysis incorporating a partially penetrant dominant melanoma susceptibility locus places MLM near IFNA and D9S126 with a maximum location score of 12.71. Therefore, the region frequently deleted in melanoma tumors on 9p21 presumably contains a locus that plays a critical role in predisposition to familial melanoma."

https://openalex.org/W2120949451,"Fibrin structure contributes to the regulation of the fibrinolytic rate. As the fibrin fiber size is decreased, the fibrinolytic rate also decreases. Fibrin structure was altered by either changing the ratio of thrombin to fibrinogen, i.e. altering the assembly rate or by adding a fibrin assembly inhibitor, iopamidol. Changes in the fibrinolytic rate were followed by measuring the time dependence of the decrease in the fiber mass/length ratio during fibrinolysis. A measure of the overall fibrinolytic rate was determined from the decrease in the mass/length ratio versus time. An 8-fold reduction in the fibrinolytic rate was seen on decreasing the mass/length ratio from 2.7 x 10(12) daltons/cm to 0.5 x 10(12) daltons/cm. It is shown that thin fibrin fibers have a decreased rate of conversion of plasminogen to plasmin by tissue plasminogen activator and that thin fibrin fibers are lysed more slowly than thick fibrin fibers."
https://openalex.org/W1541935925,"Calcium binding properties of bone acidic glycoprotein-75, osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein were determined in 10 mM imidazole buffer (pH 6.8), containing either 60 mM KCl or 150 mM NaCl. Proteins assayed were first bound to nitrocellulose to mimic substrate-bound forms in vivo; retention of phosphoproteins was determined through use of radioiodinated tracers. Binding studies were carried out both as a function of calcium concentration and the amount of phosphoprotein. In the presence of 60 mM KCl, bone acidic glycoprotein-75 exhibited the largest calcium binding capacity (139 atoms/molecule at saturation), with bone sialoprotein intermediary (83 atoms/molecule) and osteopontin lowest (50 atoms/molecule). Sites detected for each phosphoprotein exhibited overall binding constants in the 0.5-1.0 mM extracellular range. In 150 mM NaCl and 1-2 mM total calcium, phosphoproteins bound between 72 and 19 mol of calcium/mol with the same relative order. Binding was proportional to amount of phosphoprotein in either salt condition. The presence of 5 mM calcium had a different effect on concentration-dependent binding to type I collagen for each phosphoprotein. Bone acidic glycoprotein-75 alone was found to undergo an unusual calcium-enhanced polymerization reaction, confirmed by light scattering measurements, wherein collagen binding was greatest with polymeric forms. These findings demonstrate that acidic phosphoproteins from bone bind calcium atoms with a range of capacities. Calcium appears to induce conformational changes in bone acidic glycoprotein-75 which influences its self-association and binding to different substrata."

https://openalex.org/W1492512703,"Poly-N-acetyllactosamine extension has been found in O-glycans in addition to N-glycans and glycosphingolipids. Attempts were made in HL-60 and K562 cells to determine the amount of poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl O-glycans in the major sialoglycoprotein, leukosialin. Leukosialin was immunoprecipitated from [3H]glucosamine-labeled HL-60 and K562 cells. Glycopeptides were prepared by Pronase digestion, and O-glycan-containing glycopeptides were isolated by affinity chromatography using Jacalin-agarose. The glycopeptides bound to Jacalin-agarose and those unbound were treated with alkaline borohydride, and the released O-glycans were fractionated by Bio-Gel P-4 filtration. Sequential glycosidase digestion of the O-glycans, with or without pretreatment by fucosidase or neuraminidase, revealed the following conclusions. 1) Leukosialin from HL-60 cells contains about 1-2 poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl O-glycan chains/molecule. 2) About 50% of these poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl O-glycans contain sialyl Le(x) termini, NeuNAc alpha 2-->3Gal beta 1-->4 (Fuc alpha 1-->3)GlcNAc beta 1-->R. The amount of sialyl Le(x) structure in leukosialin is roughly equivalent to that on cell surfaces of HL-60 cells. 3) Leukosialin from K562 cells, on the other hand, contains no detectable amount of poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl O-glycans. 4) The presence of poly-N-acetyllactosamine in O-glycans is dependent on the core 2 beta 1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase. 5) Jacalin-agarose binds to sialylated small oligosaccharides such as NeuNAc alpha 2-->3Gal beta 1-->3(NeuNAc alpha 2-->6) GalNAc but not the hexasaccharide NeuNAc alpha 2-->3Gal beta 1-->3(NeuNAc alpha 2-->3Gal beta 1-->4GlcNAc beta 1-->6) GalNAc. These results indicate that the formation of polylactosaminyl O-glycans and sialyl Le(x) structure in O-glycans is dependent on the core 2 formation."
https://openalex.org/W1575436886,"Albumin binding to the endothelial surface apparently initiates its transcytosis via plasmalemmal vesicles and also increases capillary permselectivity. Several albumin-binding proteins, which, we call gp60, gp30, and gp18, have been identified; however, their functional relationship to each other is unclear. In this study, we show that gp30 and gp18 are both variably expressed by cultured rat fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells and are present in all tissues examined (heart, lung, skeletal muscle, diaphragm, duodenum, kidney, fat, brain, adrenal, pancreas, and liver). The binding of albumin-gold complexes (A-Au) to gp30 and gp18 was compared with that of native and modified albumins. Monomeric native bovine serum albumin (BSA) interacted much less avidly than A-Au and BSA that was chemically modified by formaldehyde (Fm-BSA) or maleic anhydride (Mal-BSA). Mal-BSA and A-Au have similar affinity constants for gp30 and gp18 (KD approximately 3-7 micrograms/ml (50-100 nM)), which is 1000-fold greater than BSA. These interactions were Ca(2+)-independent but sensitive to pH ( or = 1.0 M). Comparative biochemical characterization provided evidence of conformational changes for Mal-BSA, Fm-BSA, and A-Au. Anti-native BSA serum recognizes BSA much more avidly than modified BSA. Mal-BSA, Fm-BSA, and A-Au are much more sensitive to trypsin digestion than BSA. Cellular processing was also examined. A-Au and Mal-BSA bound at the endothelial cell surface were degraded, whereas BSA was not. Our results indicate that: (i) gp30 and gp18, unlike gp60, are expressed in all tissues tested regardless of the type of endothelia lining the microvasculature and the local mechanism of transendothelial albumin transport; (ii) BSA conformationally modified by either surface adsorption or chemical means not only interacts more avidly with gp30 and gp18 than native albumin but also is preferentially degraded by the cells; (iii) A-Au and native albumin are not equivalent probes for detecting albumin interaction sites; and (iv) gp30 and gp18 exhibit binding behavior resembling scavenger receptors. The possible roles of gp30 and gp18 in albumin binding, transcytosis, endocytosis, and even protein catabolism are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1579256405,"2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a potent modulator of epithelial cell growth and differentiation, has been shown to induce transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha in cultures of human keratinocytes and in the human keratinocyte cell line, SCC-12F. In this report, we investigated the mechanisms by which TCDD alters TGF-alpha expression. In addition, we studied the actions of TCDD on TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 expression. Treatment of SCC-12F cells with TCDD resulted in an increase in TGF-alpha and a reduction in TGF-beta 2 mRNA levels while mRNA levels for TGF-beta 1 were unchanged. Changes in TGF-alpha and TGF-beta 2 expression were maximal by 24 h. No change in the rate of transcription of TGF-alpha was detected following treatment with TCDD as determined by nuclear run-off analysis. TCDD treatment resulted in a stabilization of TGF-alpha mRNA as judged by an approximately 2-fold higher level of TGF-alpha mRNA in treated versus control cells in the presence of actinomycin D. In contrast to TGF-alpha, the rate of transcription of TGF-beta 2 was significantly reduced following TCDD treatment. These findings demonstrate that the induction of TGF-alpha expression in SCC-12F cells by TCDD occurs post-transcriptionally, primarily by mRNA stabilization, while TGF-beta 2 expression is reduced due to a decrease in the rate of TGF-beta 2 gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1484205189,"We showed previously that the DNA-binding capacity of the helix-loop-helix/leucine repeat transcription factor USF43 is lowered dramatically under nonreducing conditions. This report defines the molecular basis of this effect by showing (i) that the only two USF43 cysteine residues, both present within the helix-loop-helix protein-protein interface domain, are required for this regulation, (ii) that the sulfhydryl groups of these cysteine residues are the actual targets of this regulation, (iii) that oxidation of these groups results in both intra- and intermolecular nonrandom covalent links, (iv) that this redox modulation of USF43 DNA-binding potential can translate in vitro into a specific modulation of its ability to activate transcription from a USF-responsive promoter. The implications of these modulations of USF43 function in response to redox changes are discussed with regard to the apparent paradox of USF strong activation potential and its ubiquitous distribution in all cell types tested."
https://openalex.org/W2097574172,"Pancreatic carboxylester lipase catalyzes the exchange of 18O between water and 13,16-cis,cis-doco-sadienoic acid (DA) in monolayers at the argon-buffer interface (Muderhwa, J.M., Schmid, P.C., and Brockman, H.L. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 141). In mixed monolayers of 18O, 18O-DA and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), both the extent and mechanism of 18O exchange show characteristics of a critical transition in the range of 0.5-0.6 mol fraction of DA (Muderhwa, J.M., and Brockman, H. L. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 149). To determine if the regulatory behavior exhibited on this type of surface is limited to members of the carboxylester lipase gene family (cholinesterases), comparable experiments were performed with a genetically and functionally unrelated lipase, pancreatic colipase-dependent lipase (PL). PL readily catalyzed the exchange of 18O between water and the carboxyl group of DA with enzyme at either monolayer or catalytic levels in the fatty acid-buffer interface. The oxygen exchange reaction obeyed a random, sequential mechanism, indicating that the dissociation of the enzyme.DA complex is much faster than the rate-limiting step in the overall exchange process. Kinetic analysis of oxygen exchange in pure DA monolayers showed a first-order dependence on interfacial PL and DA concentrations from which kcat/Km values were calculated. The oxygen exchange reaction proceeded with a rate constant of 16 x 10(-2) cm2 pmol-1 s-1, a value comparable to that for hydrolysis of the ester substrate, 1,3-dioleoylglycerol. With a monolayer of PL adsorbed to the interfacial phase, kcat/Km for oxygen exchange was about 600-fold lower than the value obtained with catalytic levels of adsorbed enzyme, indicating a possible restriction of substrate diffusion in the protein-covered fatty acid monolayer. With constant bulk PL concentration and mixed lipid monolayers containing DA and the non-substrate lipid, POPC, the extent of oxygen exchange increased abruptly as the abundance of DA in the interface was increased from 0.5 to 0.6 mol fraction. Concomitant with this critical transition was a change in the apparent mechanism of oxygen exchange from coupled to random, sequential. For both the extent of oxygen exchange and its mechanism shift, the critical transition was independent of the lipid packing density, i.e. surface pressure, of the interface. These results show that PL responds similarly to carboxylester lipase with respect to changes in interfacial lipid mole fraction in DA-POPC surfaces.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1580000847,"UDP-GlcNAc:alpha 3-D-mannoside beta 1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnTI) is an N(in)/C(out) (type II) membrane protein, localized in the medial-Golgi, that initiates the conversion of high mannose N-glycans to complex N-glycans. Anti-rabbit GnTI antibodies were generated using a purified, enzymatically active, bacterial recombinant fusion protein as immunogen. Rabbit GnTI was effectively retained in the Golgi complex of transfected COS-1 cells and murine L cells, as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence using the species-specific anti-GnTI antibodies; no surface expression of rabbit GnTI could be detected in the transfected cells. Rabbit GnTI, stably expressed in murine L cells, was localized by immunoperoxidase electron microscopy to the medial-cisternae of the Golgi stack. The role of the transmembrane domain of GnTI in Golgi localization was examined by generation of a hybrid construct containing the amino-terminal 31 amino acids of GnTI, corresponding to the 25-residue transmembrane (signal/anchor) domain and flanking hydrophilic sequences, fused with ovalbumin; this ovalbumin/GnTI hybrid molecule was retained in the Golgi complex of transfected COS cells and stably transfected murine L cells. No surface expression of ovalbumin/GnTI was detected. In contrast, ovalbumin fused to the equivalent domains of the human transferrin receptor, a type II cell-surface protein, was efficiently expressed on the cell surface of transfected cells. The ovalbumin/GnTI hybrid molecules in the transfected L cells were N-glycosylated, indicating an N(in)/C(out) membrane orientation, and were localized by immunoperoxidase electron microscopy to one or two cisternae of the medial-Golgi (90% of stained Golgi profiles showed medial-cisternae staining). These results show that a signal contained within the transmembrane domain and flanking residues of GnTI specifies medial-Golgi localization."
https://openalex.org/W2024787355,"During differentiation in the thymus, immature T cells progress through an ordered sequence of developmental stages that are best characterized by variable expression of the co-receptor molecules CD4 and CD8. Crosslinking of T cell receptor (TCR) molecules on precursor thymocytes was found to block their differentiation into CD4+CD8+ cells by eliminating messenger RNA's encoding two families of developmentally important molecules: the co-receptor molecules CD4 and CD8 and the recombination activating genes 1 and 2. TCR-induced post-transcriptional regulation in early thymocytes was specific for selective messenger RNA's, required protein synthesis, and was itself developmentally regulated. These data identify a post-transcriptional mechanism that is influenced by TCR signals and that regulates early thymocyte development."
https://openalex.org/W1493219418,"Biosynthetic intermediates for the mammalian glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor have been described. The earliest GPI anchor precursor is N-acetylglucosaminylphosphatidylinositol, which is deacetylated to give glucosaminylphosphatidylinositol. This is followed by fatty acylation of the inositol ring, sequential addition of mannose residues donated by dolichyl mannosyl phosphate, and finally addition of ethanolamine phosphate. Here, we show that the final steps of GPI anchor biosynthesis are more complex than we have previously reported. Six distinct GPI anchor precursors were found to contain at least 1 ethanolamine phosphate residue. The headgroups of these glycolipids were purified and analyzed by a combination of Bio-Gel P4 chromatography and high resolution thin-layer chromatography. The sizes of neutral glycans were determined following HF dephosphorylation. The position of the ethanolamine phosphate residue was inferred from results of alpha-mannosidase treatment. Finally, the number of negative charges on the headgroups were determined by Mono Q chromatography. Our results show that the addition of ethanolamine phosphate is controlled by at least two different genes. Thus, the class F mutant, though unable to add ethanolamine phosphate to the third mannose residue, does incorporate ethanolamine phosphate into the first and second mannose residues. Only the wild type cells are capable of incorporating ethanolamine phosphate into the third mannose residue. Furthermore, the GPI core contains up to 3 ethanolamine phosphate residues. These results should facilitate the elucidation of the biochemical defects in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria."
https://openalex.org/W1493983280,"The present study was designed to investigate the effects of aging on preferential sites of glucose adduct formation on type I collagen chains. Two CNBr peptides, one from each type of chain in the type I tropocollagen molecule, were investigated in detail: alpha 1(I)CB3 and alpha 2CB3-5. Together these peptides comprise approximately 25% of the total tropocollagen molecule. The CNBr peptides were purified from rat tail tendon, obtained from animals aged 6, 18, and 36 months, by ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Sugar adducts were radiolabeled by reduction with NaB3H4. Glycated tryptic peptides were prepared from tryptic digests of alpha 2CB3-5 and alpha 1(I)CB3 by boronate affinity chromatography and HPLC. Peptides were identified by sequencing and by compositional analysis. Preferential sites of glycation were observed in both CB3 and alpha 2CB3-5. Of the 5 lysine residues in CB3, Lys-434 was the favored glycation site. Of the 18 lysine residues and 1 hydroxylysine residue in alpha 2CB3-5, 3 residues (Lys-453, Lys-479, and Lys-924) contained more than 80% of the glucose adducts on the peptide. Preferential glycation sites were highly conserved with aging. In collagen that had been glycated in vitro, the relative distribution of glucose adducts in old animals differed from that of young animals. In vitro experiments suggest that primary structure is the major determinant of preferential glycation sites but that higher order structure may influence the relative distribution of glucose adducts among these preferred sites."
https://openalex.org/W2437544824,"The iron-responsive element binding protein (IRE-BP) interacts with specific sequence/structure motifs (iron-responsive elements) within the mRNAs encoding ferritin and the transferrin receptor and thereby post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of these two proteins involved in cellular iron homeostasis. The activity of the IRE-BP is itself regulated by iron such that when cells are treated with an iron source, the RNA binding activity is decreased. The expression of recombinant human IRE-BP in murine cells has been examined as have the expressions of the endogenous IRE-BP of both human and rabbit cells. In all cases, iron down-modulated the RNA binding activity of the IRE-BP, but in no instance was this decrease in activity accompanied by a decrease in the level of the protein as judged by quantitative Western blots. Moreover, the rate of synthesis of the IRE-BP and its rate of degradation have been found to be unaltered by iron manipulation of cells in culture. Consistent with IRE-BP regulation occurring post-translationally, the iron regulation of its activity was found to be unaffected by cycloheximide. These data are discussed in terms of a model of IRE-BP regulation involving the modification of the protein's iron-sulfur center."
https://openalex.org/W1482911857,"Vertebrate retinal cones play a major role in both photopic vision and color perception. Although the molecular mechanism of visual excitation in the cone is not as well understood as in the rod, it is generally thought to involve a cone-specific G protein (cone transducin) that couples the cone visual pigment to a cGMP phosphodiesterase. Like all other G proteins, cone transducin is most likely a heterotrimer consisting of G alpha, G beta, and G gamma subunits. A G alpha subunit of cone transducin has been localized to the outer segment of bovine cones, but its associated G beta and G gamma subunits are unknown. To identify the G beta subunit involved in the phototransduction process of cones, we have developed a panel of antipeptide antisera against the most diverse region of the amino acid sequences encoded by G beta 1, G beta 2, and G beta 3 cDNAs and used them to determine the distribution of the G beta isoforms in different retinal preparations. We found that the G beta 3 subunit is present in bovine retinal transducin and phosducin-T beta gamma complex preparations which were previously thought to contain only G beta 1. Analysis of its subcellular distribution indicated that G beta 3 is predominantly cytoplasmic. Immunocytochemical staining of bovine retinal sections with the anti-G beta 3 antiserum further revealed a specific localization of G beta 3 in cones but not in rods. In contrast, anti-G beta 1 antiserum stained only the rods. These results suggest that G beta 3 is the G beta subunit of cone transducin and confirms the proposition that rods and cones utilize distinct signaling proteins for phototransduction."
https://openalex.org/W1502608485,"Type IV collagen, which has long been assumed to contain two alpha 1(IV) and one alpha 2(IV) chains, also contains alpha 3(IV), alpha 4(IV), and alpha 5(IV) chains. Stoichiometry of collagenous alpha(IV) chains differs among tissues, suggesting the existence of subclasses of type IV collagen, each with a unique chain composition. This study seeks to define, by characterization of subunit compositions of NC1 domain populations, the structural organization of type IV collagen from bovine glomerular basement membrane. NC1 hexamers from type IV collagen were separated on two affinity chromatography columns, one containing monoclonal antibodies to the alpha 3 chain, and another, to the alpha 1 chain. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay identified three NC1 hexamer populations: 1) a hexamer composed of (alpha 1)2 and (alpha 2)2 homodimers; 2) a hexamer composed of (alpha 3)2 and (alpha 4)2 homodimers; 3) a hexamer containing all four alpha chains connected in heterodimers, alpha 1-alpha 3 and alpha 2-alpha 4. Results suggest that there are two distinct type IV collagen molecules, one composed of alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) chains and another composed of alpha 3(IV) and alpha 4(IV) chains. Furthermore, polymerization occurs between molecules with the same chain composition and between molecules with different chain composition. Moreover, crosslinking between different alpha chains is restricted, thus limiting the number of possible macromolecular structures."
https://openalex.org/W160942670,"Fluorescent analogs of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) labeled with diphenylhexatrienylpropionic acid (DPH) were prepared and incorporated into the surface layer of human low density lipoprotein (LDL) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)). Fluorescence anisotropy measurements of DPH-PC and DPH-SM in both lipoprotein classes were carried out at different temperatures ranging from 20 to 37 degrees C. DPH-PC as well as DPH-SM were shown to reside in more rigid domains in Lp(a) than in LDL according to higher anisotropy values in Lp(a). In both LDL and Lp(a), DPH-PC experienced a more rigid environment than DPH-SM, suggesting different environments of PC and SM in the surface shell of the lipoproteins. Fluorescence lifetimes of the labeled lipoproteins were determined by phase and modulation fluorometry. We found bimodal Lorentzian distributions for the decay times of DPH-PC and DPH-SM in LDL and Lp(a). Lifetime distribution centers for labeled lipids were very similar except for DPH-PC in Lp(a) which was shifted to longer lifetimes, suggesting a less polar environment of PC in Lp(a) than in LDL. The distributional width of DPH-PC in Lp(a) was broader than in LDL. Accordingly, phosphatidylcholine must be localized in a more homogeneous environment in LDL as compared with Lp(a). On the other hand, no difference in distributional widths was observed for DPH-SM in both lipoproteins, showing that SM organization in Lp(a) is unaffected by apo(a). From the obtained fluorescence data we propose that apoproteins discriminate between the choline phospholipids and preferentially associate with phosphatidylcholine. This effect is enhanced in Lp(a) due to the presence of apolipoprotein(a)."
https://openalex.org/W6357302,"Mitotic and interphase HeLa cells were labeled with [3H]serine. Ceramide and its derivatives, lactosylceramide and sphingomyelin, were biosynthetically labeled under both conditions. Only in the absence of nocodazole, as the cells entered telophase, was an additional glycosphingolipid synthesized which was identified as GA2 (GalNAc(beta 1,4)Gal(beta 1,4)Glc(beta 1,1)Cer). Ceramide, the basic sphingolipid precursor, is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas its immediate derivatives are synthesized in early Golgi compartments. Transport of newly synthesized proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi is inhibited in mitotic cells while ceramide acquires early Golgi modifications under the same conditions, suggesting that ceramide can be delivered to the Golgi by a different route. Since GA2 is synthesized in late Golgi, its absence in mitotic cells strongly argues for an in vivo inhibition of intra-Golgi transport, an observation with important implications for the mechanism of Golgi division."
https://openalex.org/W1604210437,"The C3b/C4b receptor, also known as complement receptor type 1 (CR1, CD35), is a single chain glycoprotein consisting of 30 repeating homologous protein domains known as short consensus repeats (SCR) followed by transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. A series of recombinant proteins derived from CR1 has been prepared and assessed for the capacity to inhibit complement lysis of the host Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The full-length recombinant CR1 inhibited human complement-mediated CHO cell lysis, and the efficiency of inhibition was directly proportional to the number of receptors/cell. The SCR 15-18 of CR1, but not SCR 15-16, inhibited complement lysis of the host CHO cell, bound monomeric C3b (Kd,app = 6.5 x 10(-7) M), and dimeric C3b (Kd = 1.8 x 10(-8) M), and served as a cofactor in the proteolysis of C3b by factor I, confirming and extending the observations of Fearon and colleagues (Kalli, K. R., Hsu, P., Bartow, T. J., Ahearn, J. M., Matsumoto, A. K., Klickstein, L. B., and Fearon, D. T. (1991) J. Exp. Med. 174, 1451-1460). The SCR 1-4 of CR1, but not SCR 1-2, also inhibited complement lysis of the host CHO cell, indicating that more than two SCR are necessary and that four SCR are sufficient for optimal C4b binding to CR1. Thus, the structural requirements for C4b binding are analogous to those for C3b binding, namely, four SCR of CR1 form the binding sites for each of these proteins. CR1 has long been recognized to regulate extrinsic complement activation, that is, to bind to and promote the degradation of fluid phase C3b and of C3b attached to immune complex. These results demonstrate that CR1 is also an intrinsic regulator of complement activation in that, under appropriate conditions, CR1 inhibits complement-mediated lysis of the cell on which it is expressed."

With the aid of cDNA probes for the enzyme, we isolated overlapping lambda clones encompassing the human 12-lipoxygenase gene and flanking regions from a human genomic library. The gene consists of 14 exons with 13 introns and spans approximately 15 kilobases of DNA. All the exon-intron junctions conform to the GT/AG rule. Neither a typical TATA box nor a CAAT box was found in approximately 1-kb sequence of 5'-upstream region of the translation initiation site. However, this region contains several regulatory elements including four GC boxes, two CACCC boxes, three AP-2 binding sequences, and a glucocorticoid-responsive element. The major transcription initiation site was determined by primer-extension analysis as an adenosine residue at 306 bases upstream from the translation initiation codon. The chromosomal localization of the human 12-lipoxygenase gene was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and the gene was assigned to the sub-band p13.1 of chromosome 17."
https://openalex.org/W1658890500,"The high resolution crystal structures of two interacting proteins from the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (HPr) and the IIA domain of glucose permease (IIA(Glc)) from Bacillus subtilis, provide the basis for modeling the transient binary complex formed during the phosphoryl group transfer. The complementarity of the interacting surfaces implies that no major conformational transition is required. The negatively charged phosphoryl group is buried in the interface, suggesting a key role for electrostatic interactions. It is proposed that the phosphoryl transfer is triggered by a switch between two salt bridges involving Arg-17 of the HPr. The first, prior to phosphoryl group transfer, is intramolecular, with the phosphorylated His-15. The second, during the transfer, is intermolecular, with 2 aspartate residues associated with the active site of IIA(Glc). Such alternating ion pairs may be mechanistically important in other protein-protein phosphotransfer reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1508720196,"The membrane insertion of the mannitol permease (MtlA protein) of Escherichia coli, a polytopic cytoplasmic membrane protein possessing an uncleaved amphiphilic signal sequence, was studied using a cell-free protein synthesis system. The MtlA protein synthesized in the presence of inside-out cytoplasmic membrane vesicles was shown to insert into the membranes based on the following criteria: (a) co-sedimentation of the majority of the MtlA protein with the vesicles; (b) selective extraction of the membrane-associated MtlA by doxycholate but not by urea treatment; and (c) protease resistance of a defined MtlA fragment observed exclusively in the presence of membranes. Post-translational addition of membrane vesicles allowed membrane association of MtlA but did not allow efficient integration. In cell-free systems having reduced levels of the export factors SecA and SecB and exhibiting defective translocation of preOmpA and preLamB, insertion of the in vitro synthesized MtlA apparently occurred normally. In contrast, when membranes from the secY24ts mutant or trypsin-treated membranes were used, insertion of MtlA was reduced. In vivo experiments monitoring the permease activity of MtlA in the secA and secY mutants supported the conclusions of the in vitro results. Thus, the insertion of MtlA is essentially SecA- and SecB-independent but may be dependent on SecY and/or an as yet unidentified membrane protein. The requirements for the insertion of the mannitol permease are therefore clearly different from those for the translocation of most proteins having a cleavable hydrophobic signal sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1522864419,"The cytotoxicity of nephrotoxic cysteine conjugates (NCC) in the renal epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1, is due to the covalent binding of a reactive electrophilic metabolite produced from NCC metabolism by cysteine conjugate beta-lyase. Covalent binding of NCC-derived reactive metabolites leads to a cascade of events including depletion of cellular non-protein sulfhydryls, increased cytosolic free calcium, and lipid peroxidation, which is ultimately responsible for cell death. We have used this model to investigate the signalling mechanism(s) through which reactive electrophiles increase synthesis of the 70-kD heat shock protein (HSP70). NCC treatment resulted in increased HSP70 synthesis as well as time- and dose-dependent increases in hsp70 mRNA in LLC-PK1 cells. The induction of hsp70 mRNA was blocked by actinomycin D, and nuclear run-on experiments showed that the hsp70 gene was transcriptionally activated. Inhibition of protein synthesis did not block the increase in hsp70 mRNA or transcriptional activation of the hsp70 gene suggesting that induction occurs due to activation of existing transcription factors. Inhibiting the covalent binding with a beta-lyase inhibitor, aminooxyacetic acid, blocked the increase in hsp70 mRNA. Agents which do not alter binding but do prevent toxicity by blocking the rise in cytosolic free calcium and lipid peroxidation were not effective inhibitors of hsp70 mRNA accumulation. However, the thiol reducing agent, dithiothreitol, inhibited induction of hsp70 mRNA by NCC. The data suggest that covalent binding and alterations in cellular non-protein thiols serve as signals for activation of pre-existing transcription factors which increase hsp70 gene expression. It is proposed that reactive electrophiles may have a primary effect on protein conformation resulting in activation of the hsp70 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1561528729,"ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that stimulate the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of cholera toxin in vitro. ARFs are highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells and appear to be involved in vesicular protein transport. The two yeast ARFs are > 60% identical to mammalian ARFs and are essential for cell viability (Stearns, T., Kahn, R. A., Botstein, D., and Hoyt, M. A. (1990) Mol. Cell. Biol. 10, 6690-6699). Although the two yeast ARF proteins are 96% identical in amino acid sequence, the yeast ARF1 gene is constitutively expressed, whereas the ARF2 gene is repressed by glucose. Human ARF5 and ARF6 and a Giardia ARF differ substantially in size and amino acid identity from other mammalian and eukaryotic ARFs but will, as befits their designation, activate cholera toxin. Expression of human ARF5, ARF6, or Giardia ARF cDNA rescued the lethal yeast ARF double mutant (arf1, arf2). Strains rescued by human ARF5, ARF6, or Giardia ARF grew much more slowly than wild-type yeast or strains rescued with yeast ARF1. We infer from the impaired growth of these rescued strains that the homologous ARFs may have specific targeting information that does not interact effectively or efficiently with the yeast protein membrane trafficking system."
https://openalex.org/W1601665115,"Abstract Porcine ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) contains 30 1/2-cystinyl residues, all of which occur in the reduced form. Reaction of the native protein with 5,5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) resulted in the release of 30 mol of the product 5-mercapto-2-nitrobenzoate, and the loss of the RNase inhibitory activity. A linear relationship between the degree of modification and inactivation was observed. The rate of modification was greatly increased in the presence of 6 M guanidinium HCl. Reaction with substoichiometric amounts of 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) was found to yield a mixture of fully reduced active molecules, and fully oxidized inactive ones, but no partially oxidized forms were detected. This suggests that an all-or-none type of modification and inactivation took place. All 1/2-cystinyl residues in the inactive, monomeric inhibitor had formed disulfide bridges, judged by the absence of either free thiol groups or mixed disulfides with 5-mercapto-2-nitrobenzoate. This fully disulfide-cross-linked molecule had an open conformation compared to the native one, as shown by gel filtration and limited proteolysis. Reaction of phenylarsinoxide with vicinal dithiols yields products that are much more stable than those with monothiols. Titration of RI with this reagent yielded complete inactivation at a reagent/thiol ratio of 0.5. Taken together, these observations suggest that the thiol groups in RI have a diminished reactivity due to three-dimensional constraints. After the initial modification of a small number of thiol groups, a conformational change occurs which causes an increase in reactivity of the remaining thiols. The thiol groups are situated close enough together to permit the formation of 15 disulfide bridges in the inactive molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2154784388,"Amplification of a COL1-encoding region of alpha 1 (XIII) collagen transcripts of HT-1080 cell RNA suggested that exon 3 of the alpha 1 (XIII) collagen gene, which was previously deduced to be of 35 base pairs (bp) may consist of a constitutive 8-bp exon and an alternatively spliced 27-bp exon, termed here exons 3A and 3B, respectively. Furthermore, a previously unidentified alternatively spliced Gly-Xaa-Yaa-encoding exon designated as 4B was found between the sequences encoded by exons 4, redesignated here as 4A and 5. Six of the 16 potential combinations of the four consecutive alternatively spliced exons 3B, 4A, 4B, and 5 were found to exist in mRNAs, and as a result, the length of the COL1 domain may vary between 57 and 104 amino acid residues. Most of the NC2 domain is encoded by the alternatively spliced exons 12 and 13. Where previous analysis of cDNAs indicated that mRNA variants exist that contain either exon 12 or 13 sequences, amplification studies indicated here that there are also variants that lack both exons 12 and 13 but none that contain both exons simultaneously. Thus, the predicted length of this domain is either 12, 31, or 34 residues. Analyses covering both the COL1 and NC2 domains demonstrate that at least 12 mRNA species exist through the alternations of exons 3B-5, 12, and 13."
https://openalex.org/W1588484335,"Aqueous phenol extraction of the lower trypanosomatid Leptomonas samueli released into the aqueous layer a chloroform/methanol/water-soluble glycophosphosphingolipid fraction. Alkaline degradation and purification by gel filtration chromatography resulted in a tetrasaccharide (phosphatidylinositol (PI)-oligosaccharide A), and a pentasaccharide (PI-oligosaccharide B), each containing 2 mol of 2-aminoethylphosphonate and 1 mol of phosphate. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry suggested that the structure of PI-oligosaccharide A is [formula: see text] and that of PI-oligosaccharide B is as shown. [formula: see text] Both compounds contain an inositol unit linked to ceramide via a phosphodiester bridge. The major aliphatic components of the ceramide portion are stearic acid, lignoceric acid, and C20-phytosphingosine. These novel glycolipids fall within the glycosylated phosphatidylinositol (GPI) family, since they contain the core structure Man alpha (1-->4)GlcNH2 alpha (1-->6)myo-inositol-1-PO4, which is also found in the glycoinositolphospholipids and lipophosphoglycan of Leishmania spp., the L. major promastigote surface protease, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor of Trypanosoma brucei variant surface glycoprotein, and the lipopeptidophosphoglycan of Trypanosoma cruzi. The glycophosphosphingolipids of Leptomonas have features in common with the glycolipids of both Leishmania and T. cruzi, resembling the former by the alpha (1-->3) linkage of mannose to the GPI core, while the 2-aminoethylphosphonate substituent on O-6 of glucosamine and the presence of ceramide in place of glycerol lipids is more reminiscent of T. cruzi. Thus these data lend some support to the hypothesis that both T. cruzi and Leishmania evolved from a Leptomonas-like ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W1875182270,"Aldose reductase is an NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase that catalyzes the reduction of a broad range of aldehydes, including glucose. Since aldose reductase has been strongly implicated in the development of the chronic complications of diabetes mellitus, much effort has been devoted to understanding the structure and mechanism of this enzyme, and many aldose reductase inhibitors have been developed as potential drugs for the treatment of these complications. We describe here the 2.75 A crystal structure of recombinant human aldose reductase (Cys-298 to Ser mutant) complexed with NADPH. This mutant displays unusual kinetic behavior characterized by high Km/high Vmax substrate kinetics and reduced sensitivity to certain aldose reductase inhibitors. The crystal structure revealed that the enzyme is a beta/alpha-barrel with the coenzyme-binding domain located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the parallel strands of the barrel. The enzyme undergoes a large conformational change upon binding NADPH which involves the reorientation of loop 7 to a position which appears to lock the coenzyme into place. NADPH is bound to aldose reductase in an unusual manner, more similar to FAD- rather than NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductases. No disulfide bridges were observed in the crystal structure."
https://openalex.org/W1545028343,"The effects of exogenous GM1 ganglioside on depolarization and ligand-induced Ca2+ signaling were investigated in PC12 cells. Cellular responses to K+ depolarization and bradykinin application in control and GM1-treated cells were examined with respect to: 1) changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) measured using fura-2 fluorescence in single cells, and 2) changes in Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase activity as assayed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis of the site-specific phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase. Pretreatment of cells with GM1 (10 or 100 microM) enhanced K+ depolarization-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i and in 32PO4 incorporation into tyrosine hydroxylase phosphopeptide T2, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II substrate. In contrast, GM1 treatment had no effect on the transient increases in [Ca2+]i evoked by bradykinin or on bradykinin-induced increases in the site-specific phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase. The depolarization-induced and GM1-enhanced increases in [Ca2+]i and T2 phosphorylation were prevented by removal of external Ca2+ or pretreatment with 1 microM nitrendipine, suggesting that these increases result from Ca2+ entry through dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels. The ability of exogenous gangliosides to potentiate increases in [Ca2+]i may underlie their diverse neuritogenic and neurotrophic actions in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1576686733,"Ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1, is the first enzyme in the pathway leading to formation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates and represents a potential target for regulation in the metabolic control of the conjugation reaction. Antiserum raised against human E1 recognizes two immunoreactive proteins in extracts from several human cell lines and animal tissues. We have characterized these two immunoreactive proteins in HeLa cells and present evidence that they are isoforms of E1. We have designated these isoforms as E1(110 kDa) and E1(117 kDa) to reflect their apparent molecular masses determined from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These two immunoreactive proteins are immunologically similar, have nearly identical peptide maps, and comigrate with enzymatic activity characteristic of E1 in native polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic separations. Pulse-labeling experiments reveal that both isoforms are long-lived in vivo with degradation rates which are inconsistent with a proenzyme/enzyme model. Furthermore, their rates of degradation, which vary depending on the cell line studied, are kinetically distinguishable in contact-inhibited human lung fibroblasts. This work represents the first demonstration of E1 isoforms in a non-plant species and carries important implications for studies of the regulatory mechanisms controlling ubiquitin conjugation."
https://openalex.org/W1576276646,"The antiproliferative effect of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) on human tumor and normal cells has been well established. However, the genes involved in the dsRNA-induced antiproliferative response and the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs remain less well defined. We have studied the ability of synthetic dsRNA, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I.C)) to modify human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) growth and report that poly(I.C) induces a dose-dependent inhibition of HUVEC proliferation in vitro. In addition, the mRNA levels for the cytokines interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and interferon-beta 1 are induced in poly(I.C)-treated cells. Moreover, the growth inhibitory effects of poly(I.C) are relieved when cells are grown in the presence of an IL-1 alpha antisense oligonucleotide to the human IL-1 alpha transcript. Thus, the effects of poly(I.C) appear to be mediated, in part, through the function of IL-1 alpha, suggesting an alternative pathway for dsRNA-mediated inhibition of human endothelial cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1612570252,"GDP-dissociation stimulators (GDSs) are the key element for the regeneration of the active state of ras proteins, but despite intensive investigations, little is so far known about their functional and structural properties, particularly in mammals. A growing number of genes from various organisms have been postulated to encode GDSs on the basis of sequence similarity with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC25 gene, whose product acts as a GDS of RAS proteins. However, except for CDC25 and the related SDC25 C-domain, no biochemical evidence of ras GDS activity for these CDC25-like proteins has yet been available. We show that the product of a recently isolated mouse CDC25-like gene (CDC25Mm) can strongly enhance (more than 1000 times) the GDP release from both human c-Ha-ras p21 and yeast RAS2 in vitro. As a consequence, the CDC25Mm induces a rapid formation of the biologically active Ras.GTP complex. This GDS is much more active on the GDP than on the GTP complex and has a narrow substrate specificity, since it was found to be inactive on several ras-like proteins. The mouse GDS can efficiently substitute for yeast CDC25 in an in vitro adenylylcyclase assay on RAS2 cdc25 yeast membranes. Our results show that a cloned GDP to GTP exchange factor of mammalian ras belongs to the novel family of CDC25-like proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2125546818,"We have used circular dichroism and structure-directed drugs to identify the role of structural features, wide and narrow grooves in particular, required for the cooperative polymerization, recognition of homologous sequences, and the formation of joint molecules promoted by recA protein. The path of cooperative polymerization of recA protein was deduced by its ability to cause quantitative displacement of distamycin from the narrow groove of duplex DNA. By contrast, methyl green bound to the wide groove was retained by the nucleoprotein filaments comprised of recA protein-DNA. Further, the mode of binding of these ligands and recA protein to DNA was confirmed by DNaseI digestion. More importantly, the formation of joint molecules was prevented by distamycin in the narrow groove while methyl green in the wide groove had no adverse effect. Intriguingly, distamycin interfered with the production of coaggregates between nucleoprotein filaments of recA protein-M13 ssDNA and naked linear M13 duplex DNA, but not with linear phi X174 duplex DNA. Thus, these data, in conjunction with molecular modeling, suggest that the narrow grooves of duplex DNA provide the fundamental framework required for the cooperative polymerization of recA protein and alignment of homologous sequences. These findings and their significance are discussed in relation to models of homologous pairing between two intertwined DNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1554400716,"A recombinant baculovirus encoding a single-chain murine major histocompatibility complex class I molecule in which the first three domains of H-2Kd are fused to beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m) via a 15-amino acid linker has been isolated and used to infect lepidopteran cells. A soluble, 391-amino acid single-chain H-2Kd (SC-Kd) molecule of 48 kDa was synthesized and glycosylated in insect cells and could be purified in the absence of detergents by affinity chromatography using the anti-H-2Kd monoclonal antibody SF1.1.1.1. We tested the ability of SC-Kd to bind antigenic peptides using a direct binding assay based on photoaffinity labeling. The photoreactive derivative was prepared from the H-2Kd-restricted Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein (P.b. CS) peptide 253-260 (YIPSAEKI), a probe that we had previously shown to be unable to bind to the H-2Kd heavy chain in infected cells in the absence of co-expressed beta 2-microglobulin. SC-Kd expressed in insect cells did not require additional mouse beta 2-m to bind the photoprobe, indicating that the covalently attached beta 2-m could substitute for the free molecule. Similarly, binding of the P.b. CS photoaffinity probe to the purified SC-Kd molecule was unaffected by the addition of exogenous beta 2-m. This is in contrast to H-2KdQ10, a soluble H-2Kd molecule in which beta 2-m is noncovalently bound to the soluble heavy chain, whose ability to bind the photoaffinity probe is greatly enhanced in the presence of an excess of exogenous beta 2-m. The binding of the probe to SC-Kd was allele-specific, since labeling was selectively inhibited only by antigenic peptides known to be presented by the H-2Kd molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1506446844,"B lymphocytes express on their surface a membrane form of IgM (mIgM), and synthesize but fail to secrete a secretory form of IgM (sIgM). Plasma cells shift to the exclusive synthesis and efficient secretion of sIgM. The sIgM in B cells differs from that in plasma cells in its pattern of assembly: in plasma cells, monomers of sIgM are assembled into polymers and only polymers are secreted; in B lymphocytes, monomeric sIgM is neither polymerized nor secreted and is degraded intracellularly. In this article we blocked the export of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum at low temperatures or with energy poisons or brefeldin A, and localized the different assembly steps of mIgM and sIgM in the 38C B lymphocytes and of sIgM in the 38C-derived sIgM-secreting D2 hybridoma. In both cell lines, sIgM assembly into monomers was not affected, whereas polymerization of sIgM in D2 cells and monomer formation of mIgM in 38C cells were strongly inhibited. Moreover, probing with specific lectins revealed galactosylated monomers and polymers in D2 cells and galactosylated hemimer and monomers only of mIgM in 38C cells. In addition, when Golgi functions were hampered with Tris base, monomerization of mIgM and polymerization of sIgM were attenuated. These results indicate that polymerization of sIgM in D2 cells and monomerization of mIgM in 38C cells are post-endoplasmic reticulum events, occurring in or beyond the trans-Golgi galactosylation compartment. Since only polymers are secreted from D2 cells and only monomeric mIgM is displayed on the surface of 38C cells, partially assembled molecules may traverse the secretory pathway yet are restricted from the cell surface. Furthermore, monomeric sIgM in 38C cells is never galactosylated, thus it is degraded prior to the galactosylation compartment. We conclude that targeting of sIgM to degradation in 38C cells precedes its assembly site into polymers in D2 cells. This implies that degradation of sIgM does not result from the incompetence of 38C cells to polymerize. Rather, assembly of sIgM into polymers and their subsequent secretion are prevented in B lymphocytes by preceding targeting of monomeric sIgM to degradation."

https://openalex.org/W1567928670,"This study examines mechanisms that regulate the activation of blood coagulation proteases on intact cell membranes. The activation of factor X by factors IXa and VIIIa assembled on viable monocytes is presented as a biologically relevant model for membrane-dependent proteolysis of coagulation zymogens. The hypothesis that this reaction is limited by diffusion was tested by comparing predicted with observed concentration dependence, temperature dependence, and effective rate coefficient. Rates of factor X catalysis were measured using a chromogenic substrate specific for the product, factor Xa. The value of KR and of K1/2, i.e. concentrations giving half-maximal rates in reciprocal functional titrations with substrate and enzyme, respectively, were directly correlated with the concentration of the titrated component. Arrhenius plots constructed over temperatures encompassing 10-35 degrees C were biphasic with downward concavity. Apparent activation energies were 6.01 +/- 0.93 and 35.84 +/- 8.9 kcal/mol for the interval above and below the inflection point, respectively. The effective rate coefficient calculated from apparent kinetic parameters was 3.58 +/- 0.1 x 10(12) M-1 s-1. This rate is similar to the maximal rate of collision between factor X molecules and the monocyte, i.e. 2.9 x 10(12) M-1 s-1 estimated from the steady-state von Smoluchowski equation for uniformly reacting spherical particles. The observed agreement between predicted and experimental results indicates that under biologically relevant conditions, the rate of factor X activation by the intrinsic protease is controlled by diffusion of factor X toward the catalytic site."

https://openalex.org/W1487233829,"Microsomal forms of eukaryotic cytochrome P450 proteins are integral membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane which are targeted to the ER via the signal recognition particle pathway. A hydrophobic amino terminus serves as a combined signal sequence and major membrane anchor (signal-anchor sequence) for the microsomal P450s. We have examined the insertion of bovine 17 alpha-hydroxylase (P45017 alpha) into the ER of COS 1 cells in order to evaluate the role of membrane insertion of the amino-terminal signal-anchor of microsomal P450s as a functional determinant for these enzymes. Previously, we have shown that deletion of the hydrophobic amino terminus from P45017 alpha reduced membrane targeting and insertion by 5-fold compared with the wild-type protein, abolished enzymatic activity, and resulted in an aberrant CO difference spectrum. In the present study we have replaced the amino terminus of P45017 alpha with two heterologous signal-anchor sequences, one that is similar and one that is very different from the P45017 alpha sequence. The chimeric proteins were expressed in COS 1 cells. Immunoblot analysis of isolated microsomal membranes show that the heterologous signal-anchor sequences functioned to target the P45017 alpha protein to the ER. Enzymatic assays in intact COS 1 cells indicate that both the chimeric proteins are efficient 17 alpha-hydroxylase enzymes. The amino terminus of P45017 alpha was also replaced with a sequence that is not a signal-anchor, and the expressed protein was neither targeted to the ER nor was functional in COS 1 cells. In conclusion, both the structure and catalytic activity of P45017 alpha in COS 1 cells is dependent upon an amino-terminal sequence that functions as a signal-anchor sequence and not upon the precise sequence of the amino terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1668606360,"Heparin, in Langmuirian fashion, binds stoichiometrically with high affinity, Kd approximately 100 nM, to both fibrinogen and fibrin adsorbed as monomolecular films to lecithin-coated, microscopic, polystyrene-divinylbenzene beads. Complex formation inhibits aggregation of fibrin-coated beads, and it also results in dissociation of preformed aggregates of fibrin-coated beads. These phenomena are not caused by desorption of fibrin(ogen), indirect inhibition of thrombin activity, or mere electrostatic repulsion of charged particles. Instead, these data are consistent with the proposal that the complexed heparin interferes directly with dimer formation between fibrin molecules adsorbed to colliding beads. We describe these phenomena and their application to the development of sensitive analytical methods for quantitating heparin. Based on these observations, we also propose a role for endogenous heparin in the physiologic regulation of fibrin-mediated adhesion of surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1627538739,"Escherichia coli integration host factor (IHF) contributes to the regulation of R6K plasmid copy number by counteracting the inhibitory activity of the plasmid-encoded replication protein pi. Two IHF-binding sites (ihf1 and ihf2) flank seven iterons in the origin which bind pi protein. As previously shown by electron microscopy, IHF can compact a large segment of the R6K gamma origin DNA, encompassing site ihf1, an AT-rich domain containing ihf1, and some of the seven iterons located downstream of ihf1. We termed this phenomenon IHF-mediated DNA folding. This folding requires a high IHF concentration, and the region of the origin (replication enhancer) located to the left of the AT-rich domain. However, site ihf2 is not necessary in forming the folded structure. As reported here, IHF binding to ihf2 can be detected in gel mobility shift assays only if the leftmost enhancer region is absent. Sites ihf1 and ihf2 each contain two consensus IHF sequences. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to determine which sequences are recognized by IHF protein and which sites are involved in forming the various gamma origin-IHF complexes. Finally, we define the boundaries of protection from DNaseI digestion when IHF is bound to ihf2. We propose a model in which IHF protein bound to ihf1, in the absence of the enhancer region, facilitates IHF binding to ihf2."
