https://openalex.org/W2056986410,"We describe here a signal transduction pathway controlling the establishment of mammalian cell polarity. Scratching a confluent monolayer of primary rat astrocytes leads to polarization of cells at the leading edge. The microtubule organizing center, the microtubule cytoskeleton, and the Golgi reorganize to face the new free space, and directed cell protrusion and migration specifically occur perpendicularly to the scratch. We show here that the interaction of integrins with extracellular matrix at the newly formed cell front leads to the activation and polarized recruitment of Cdc42, which in turn recruits and activates a cytoplasmic mPar6/PKCzeta complex. Localized PKCzeta activity, acting through the microtubule motor protein dynein, is required for all aspects of induced polarity in these cells."

https://openalex.org/W2169062325,"Neural precursors often generate distinct cell types in a specific order, but the intrinsic or extrinsic cues regulating the timing of cell fate specification are poorly understood. Here we show that Drosophila neural precursors (neuroblasts) sequentially express the transcription factors Hunchback --> Krüppel --> Pdm --> Castor, with differentiated progeny maintaining the transcription factor profile present at their birth. Hunchback is necessary and sufficient for first-born cell fates, whereas Krüppel is necessary and sufficient for second-born cell fates; this is observed in multiple lineages and is independent of the cell type involved. We propose that Hunchback and Krüppel control early-born temporal identity in neuroblast cell lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2041676007,"How do cells discriminate between selectively edited mRNAs that encode new protein isoforms, and dsRNA-induced, promiscuously edited RNAs that encode nonfunctional, mutant proteins? We have developed a Xenopus oocyte model system which shows that a variety of hyperedited, inosine-containing RNAs are specifically retained in the nucleus. To uncover the mechanism of inosine-induced retention, HeLa cell nuclear extracts were used to isolate a multiprotein complex that binds specifically and cooperatively to inosine-containing RNAs. This complex contains the inosine-specific RNA binding protein p54nrb, the splicing factor PSF, and the inner nuclear matrix structural protein matrin 3. We provide evidence that one function of the complex identified here is to anchor hyperedited RNAs to the nuclear matrix, while allowing selectively edited mRNAs to be exported."
https://openalex.org/W2044630463,"The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates important stress and developmental responses. We have isolated a recessive ABA hypersensitive mutant, abh1, that shows hormone specificity to ABA. ABH1 encodes the Arabidopsis homolog of a nuclear mRNA cap binding protein and functions in a heterodimeric complex to bind the mRNA cap structure. DNA chip analyses show that only a few transcripts are down-regulated in abh1, several of which are implicated in ABA signaling. Consistent with these results, abh1 plants show ABA-hypersensitive stomatal closing and reduced wilting during drought. Interestingly, ABA-hypersensitive cytosolic calcium increases in abh1 guard cells demonstrate amplification of early ABA signaling. Thus, ABH1 represents a modulator of ABA signaling proposed to function by transcript alteration of early ABA signaling elements."
https://openalex.org/W2069225280,"We present evidence that regulation of dense-core secretory granule biogenesis and hormone secretion in endocrine cells is dependent on chromogranin A (CGA). Downregulation of CGA expression in a neuroendocrine cell line, PC12, by antisense RNAs led to profound loss of dense-core secretory granules, impairment of regulated secretion of a transfected prohormone, and reduction of secretory granule proteins. Transfection of bovine CGA into a CGA-deficient PC12 clone rescued the regulated secretory phenotype. Stable transfection of CGA into a CGA-deficient pituitary cell line, 6T3, lacking a regulated secretory pathway, restored regulated secretion. Overexpression of CGA induced dense-core granules, immunoreactive for CGA, in nonendocrine fibroblast CV-1 cells. We conclude that CGA is an “on/off” switch that alone is sufficient to drive dense-core secretory granule biogenesis and hormone sequestration in endocrine cells."
https://openalex.org/W2015032724,"To examine the role of the mitochondrial polymerase (Pol γ) in clinically observed toxicity of nucleoside analogs used to treat AIDS, we examined the kinetics of incorporation catalyzed by Pol γ for each Food and Drug Administration-approved analog plus 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil (FIAU), β-L-(−)-2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (−)3TC, and (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine (PMPA). We used recombinant exonuclease-deficient (E200A), reconstituted human Pol γ holoenzyme in single turnover kinetic studies to measureKd (Km) andkpol (kcat) to estimate the specificity constant (kcat/Km) for each nucleoside analog triphosphate. The specificity constants vary more than 500,000-fold for the series ddC > ddA (ddI) > 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (d4T) ≫ (+)3TC ≫ (−)3TC > PMPA > azidothymidine (AZT) ≫ Carbovir (CBV). Abacavir (prodrug of CBV) and PMPA are two new drugs that are expected to be least toxic. Notably, the higher toxicities of d4T, ddC, and ddA arose from their 13–36-fold tighter binding relative to the normal dNTP even though their rates of incorporation were comparable with PMPA and AZT. We also examined the rate of exonuclease removal of each analog after incorporation. The rates varied from 0.06 to 0.0004 s−1 for the series FIAU > (+)3TC ∼ (−)3TC > CBV > AZT > PMPA ∼ d4T ≫ ddA (ddI) ≫ ddC. Removal of ddC was too slow to measure (<0.00002 s−1). The high toxicity of dideoxy compounds, ddC and ddI (metabolized to ddA), may be a combination of high rates of incorporation and ineffective exonuclease removal. Conversely, the more effective excision of (−)3TC, CBV, and AZT may contribute to lower toxicity. FIAU is readily extended by the next correct base pair (0.13 s−1) faster than it is removed (0.06 s−1) and, therefore, is stably incorporated and highly mutagenic. We define a toxicity index for chain terminators to account for relative rates of incorporation versus removal. These results provide a method to rapidly screen new analogs for potential toxicity.

Treatment with this mixture allows patients to coexist with a low level of virus for years, but treatments are limited by the development of resistance of HIV to the drugs on the one hand and toxicity of nucleoside analogs on the other. Toxicity of nucleoside analogs is particularly troublesome for the long term management of the viral infection. Nucleoside analogs function as chain terminators to suppress viral replication by HIV-1 RT, and because HIV RT lacks a proofreading exonuclease, the specificity of nucleoside analogs toward HIV RT results from selective discrimination during incorporation and/or from removal by the proofreading exonuclease of the host DNA polymerase. Six nucleoside analogs have received Food and Drug Administration approval for treatment of HIV, and these analogs are illustrated with others in Fig. 1. All of these analogs act to halt viral replication by chain termination since they each lack a 3′-OH. There is growing evidence that these analogs also act as substrates for human mitochondrial DNA polymerase (Pol γ), resulting in inhibition of mitochondrial replication (1Martin J.L. Brown C.E.

Patients experience side effects due to toxicity of these drugs, which are, in part, caused by interaction with Pol γ (2Parker W.B. Cheng Y.C. J. NIH Res. 1994; 6: 57-61Google Scholar, 6Horn D.M. Neeb L.A. Colacino J.M. Richardson F.C. Antiviral Res. 1997; 34: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The differences in analog toxicity may result from a combination of cellular uptake (7Chang C.N. Skalski V. Zhou J.H. Cheng Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22414-22420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), organellar transport (2Parker W.B. Cheng Y.C. J. NIH Res. 1994; 6: 57-61Google Scholar), metabolic activation (7Chang C.N.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22414-22420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and removal or degradation from the system (2Parker W.B. Cheng Y.C. J. NIH Res. 1994; 6: 57-61Google Scholar). Generally, the individual contributions of these factors to analog toxicity is unknown. General symptoms of nucleoside analog toxicity include peripheral neuropathy (seen with 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (d4T), ddI, and ddC), myopathy, and bone marrow suppression (seen with 3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (AZT)), and pancreatitis (seen with ddI) (8Skowron G. Merigan T.C. Am. J. Med. 1990; 88, (5B): 20S-23SAbstract Full Text PDF Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Many of the side effects resulting from nucleoside analog treatment mimic the symptoms of mitochondrial diseases caused by genetic defects (4Lewis W. Dalakas M.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Moreover, loss of mitochondrial DNA and changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure have been observed in cell culture studies after treatment with nucleoside analogs (9Arnaudo E. Dalakas M. Shanske S.

With the exception of 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil (FIAU), which is not a chain terminator, these side effects are reversible upon withdrawal of drug treatment, suggesting removal of the chain terminators from the mitochondrial DNA and restoration of normal rates of replication.Table ISymptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction and toxicity of antiviral nucleoside analog treatmentSystem affectedSymptomNucleoside analogNeuromuscularSensorineural deafnessddCMyopathyAZTPeripheral neuropathyd4T, ddI, ddCCardiacHypertrophic cardiomyopathyAZT, ddI, ddCEndocrineDiabetes mellitusddIHematologicalSideroblastic anemia, pancytopeniaAZTPancreas and liverPancreatitisd4T, ddIHepatocellular failure, lactic acidosisAZT, ddI, d4TData are summarized from Ref. 17Brinkman K.

Studies using cell lines with compartment-specific kinases showed that nucleoside analogs that were phosphorylated in the mitochondria became trapped in this compartment and that the location of phosphorylation was important in determining whether an analog was incorporated into mitochondrial or nuclear DNA (18Zhu C. Johansson M. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26727-26731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data are useful in analyzing overall drug toxicity, but the differences in nucleoside analog phosphorylation and the number of mitochondria per cell are based on the energetic requirements of each cell type, which can lead to a considerable variation of observed cell- and organ-specific toxicity. Structure/function studies with nucleoside analogs and Pol γ may provide useful insight for design of less toxic, viral polymerase-specific analogs. We have examined the interactions between human Pol γ and nucleoside analogs during in vitropolymerization to evaluate the possible mechanistic basis of nucleoside analog toxicity. To provide directly quantifiable data, we have performed transient kinetic studies to carefully examine the kinetics of incorporation of each of the nucleoside analog triphosphates by Pol γ and to compare with our previous analysis of HIV RT (19Suo Z. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27250-27258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Kerr S.G. Anderson K.S.

The nucleoside analogs in this study were the triphosphate forms of d4T (Stavudine); 2′,3′-dideoxyadenosine (active form of ddI, Didanosine); AZT (Zidovudine); FIAU; (−)-cis-2-amino-1,9-dihydro-9-(4-hydroxymethyl)-2-cyclopenten-1-yl)-6H-purine-6-one (Carbovir, CBV, active form of Abacavir); and (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine (PMPA, Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). ddATP was obtained from Sigma, whereas d4TTP and AZTTP were obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). PMPApp and CBVTP were kind gifts of Gilead Sciences (Foster City, CA) and Dr. William B. Parker (Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL), respectively. Overexpression and purification of recombinant human Pol γ were previously described (22Graves S.W. Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6050-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Holoenzyme was reconstituted at a 1:5 ratio of catalytic subunit to accessory subunit. All of the studies on the kinetics of incorporation of nucleoside analog triphosphates were conducted using an exonuclease-deficient mutant (E200A). This mutant was selected based upon studies showing that this single point mutation did not alter the kinetics of normal nucleotide incorporation (data not shown). All other studies were conducted using wild-type enzyme. A DNA primer/template of 25 and 45 nucleotides, respectively, was employed for all experiments except for CBV incorporation and excision. The primer sequence was 5′-GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA-3′, and the template sequence was 5′-GGACGGCATTGGATCGAGGTTGAGTTGGTTGGACGGCTGCGAGGC-3′. The template sequence opposite the 26th primer position was altered to allow correct base pairing for each analog incorporation reaction. The 30-mer primer utilized for CBVTP experiments was 5′- GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCAACCTC-3′, and the corresponding 45-mer template was used. Primers were 5′-32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction was terminated by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. Unincorporated nucleotide was removed using a Bio-Spin 6 column (Bio-Rad). Primer was annealed to 45-mer template by combining at an equimolar ratio, heating to 95 °C, and cooling to room temperature. Primers containing 3′-terminal nucleoside analog residues were created to examine excision of each analog. A polymerase reaction was performed using 1 µm polymerase, 3 µm duplex DNA (containing appropriate template base opposite 26th primer position), and 50 µm analog in standard reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2). Primer terminated with ddAMP, 2The suffixes -MP or -TP are added to the drug abbreviations to indicate their monophosphate or triphosphate forms, respectively. ddIMP, and FIAUMP were created using Pol γ, and HIV-1 RT was used for primers terminated in AZTMP, CBVMP, or d4TMP. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and then the products were gel-purified to obtain the analog-terminated primer. Primers were labeled, and DNA duplexes were annealed as described above. All polymerase assays were performed at 37 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2. The holoenzyme was reconstituted by incubating the two protein subunits for 20 min on ice in reaction buffer lacking magnesium. DNA was then added to the proteins, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 20 min on ice. Reactions were initiated by the addition of nucleotide and magnesium in the same reaction buffer at 37 °C and then quenched with 0.3 mEDTA. Alternatively, only magnesium was added to initiate excision reactions. All concentrations given are final reaction conditions. Polymerase and excision assay products were separated on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gels, imaged on a Storm 860, and quantified using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) or a Bio-Rad GS525 Imager using Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad). Single nucleotide incorporation assays were performed with various concentrations of nucleotide to examine the nucleotide concentration dependence of the incorporation rate. Single turnover conditions were employed where the concentration of enzyme is greater than the concentration of DNA. Specific reaction conditions are listed in each figure legend. A time course was performed for each concentration of dNTP. The concentration of extended product 26-mer or 31-mer (for CBVTP incorporation) DNA was plotted against time and fit to a single exponential ([product] =A*e−kt + C). The observed rates were then plotted against nucleotide concentrations, and the data were fit to a hyperbola (observed rate =kpol[dNTP]/(Kd + [dNTP]) to obtain the Kd and the maximum rate of polymerization, kpol, for each nucleoside analog. A quadratic equation was used to fit the rate data for d4TTP and ddCTP incorporation due to the tightness of nucleotide binding ([dNTP] = 0.5(Kd + [dNTP] +kpol) − [0.25(Kd + [dNTP] + kpol)2 − ([dNTP]kpol)]1/2). In each case, because of the established mechanism for the polymerase (24Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), the measured Kd and kpol define the Km and kcat for polymerization, respectively. However, our methods circumvent the numerous errors in attempting to measure steady state parameters for incorporation with defined oligonucleotides and a processive enzyme, where DNA release from the enzyme often limits the observed rate of polymerization. Wild-type polymerase holoenzyme (100 nm) was preincubated with 75 nm 26/45 or 31/45 DNA containing a 3′-terminal nucleoside analog, and MgCl2was added to initiate the hydrolysis reaction. The loss of full-length substrate was quantified and plotted against time. Data were fit to a single exponential, [primer] = A*e−kt+ C, where k represents the rate of excision (kexo) in a single turnover. Incorporation of nucleoside analogs into DNA by Pol γ was investigated to determine the kinetic parameters governing enzyme discrimination against incorporation of these substrates based upon the supposition that those most easily incorporated and most difficult to remove would be the most toxic. Single turnover conditions were employed in that the concentration of enzyme was in excess of the concentration of DNA. Kinetic studies on Pol γ and every other DNA polymerase examined with natural deoxynucleoside triphosphate substrates have shown that the pre-steady state burst of polymerization defines the rate of incorporation, whereas the slower steady state rate is limited by the rate of dissociation of DNA from the enzyme (23Johnson A.A.

By restricting our attention to the first turnover and examining the reaction on a millisecond time scale, we circumvent the slower reactions, limiting the steady state measurements on processive enzymes. For each analog, the concentration dependence of the rate of incorporation was obtained from a series of polymerization experiments performed at various nucleotide concentrations. The concentration dependence defines the Kd for ground state nucleotide binding and the maximum rate, kpol, for incorporation. Based upon knowledge of the mechanism of the reaction, these parameters define the Km andkcat, respectively, for incorporation and the ratio kpol/Kd =kcat/Km, the specificity constant, because nucleotide binding is a rapid equilibrium step and is followed by a single rate-limiting incorporation reaction (25Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The concentration dependence of d4TTP incorporation by Pol γ is illustrated in Fig. 2A. The rate of incorporation was established by a fit to a single exponential at each nucleotide concentration. The nucleotide concentration dependence of the rate (Fig. 2B) was fit to a quadratic equation to yield a Kd for ground state binding for d4TTP of 44.7 ± 7.5 nm and a maximum rate of polymerization of 0.24 ± 0.01 s−1 (Fig.2B). The data had to be fit to a quadratic equation rather than a hyperbola because the Kd was less than the concentration of enzyme-DNA used in the experiment. Importantly, the tight binding of d4TTP makes this analog highly competitive for incorporation by Pol γ as defined by the specificity constant (TableII) even though its rate of incorporation is not large.Table IIKinetic parameters for incorporation of nucleoside analogs by Pol γAnalogKdkpolSpecificityDiscrimination2-aDiscrimination = (kpol/Kd)correct/(kpol/Kd)analog, where values for natural nucleotide specificity are taken from Ref. 24.µms−1kpol/KdddCTP2-bRef. 36.0.041 ± 0.0070.66 ± 0.0216.12.9ddATP0.022 ± 0.0090.31 ± 0.0214.14.0d4TTP0.045 ± 0.0070.24 ± 0.015.47.4(+)3TCTP2-bRef. 36.1.5 ± 0.10.35 ± 0.010.23174ddITP6.3 ± 20.15 ± 0.010.0241,903(−)3TCTP2-bRef. 36.9.2 ± 0.90.125 ± 0.0050.0142,857PMPApp40.3 ± 5.70.21 ± 0.010.00511,400AZTTP187 ± 540.2 ± 0.042-cEstimated based upon the concentration dependence of the reaction amplitude rather than rate.0.00137,103CBVTP13 ± 1.50.0018 ± 0.00010.00014902,7772-dCalculated fromkpol = 175 ± 10 s−1 andKd = 1.4 ± 0.3 µm for dGTP incorporation with 30/45 DNA substrate.FIAUTP2.9 ± 0.724 ± 28.34.82-a Discrimination = (kpol/Kd)correct/(kpol/Kd)analog, where values for natural nucleotide specificity are taken from Ref. 24Johnson A.A.

Therefore, to examine the toxicity of ddI, we examined the kinetics of incorporation of ddATP. The ground state nucleotide binding and maximum polymerization rate for ddATP incorporation were 0.022 ± 0.009 µm and 0.31 ± 0.02 s−1, respectively (Fig.3, Table II).

It should be noted that under similar conditions, excision of CBVMP was found to be faster and comparable with the rate of 3TCMP removal. Open table in a new tab The active form of Abacavir is CBVTP. Incorporation of CBVTP occurred at a maximum polymerization rate of 0.0018 ± 0.0001 s−1, with a ground state nucleotide binding of 13 ± 1.5 µm (Fig. 4, Table II). The maximum rate of incorporation of CBVTP was the slowest we observed for the analogs in this study (Fig. 4, Table II). Pre-steady state burst experiments in which primer/template is in slight excess of enzyme were used to show that the rate-limiting step for CBVTP incorporation had changed from the release of product to catalysis (Fig. 4A) due to the lack of a burst. With DNA in excess, natural dNTPs and most nucleoside analog triphosphates show a pre-steady state burst under these conditions reflecting fast catalysis followed by slow release of product, as illustrated by the results of a similar experiment with dGTP (see inset to Fig.4A). The kinetics of AZTTP incorporation by Pol γ were unusual in that there was no dependence of the rate on nucleotide concentration. A plot of the rate of incorporation against nucleotide incorporation illustrates a higher degree of error when fitting data for lower concentrations of AZTTP (Fig.5B) due to the low amplitude of this reaction. Unlike all other nucleotides and analogs investigated, the amplitude of the AZT incorporation reaction was concentration-dependent (Fig. 5C). Fitting the concentration dependence of the amplitude provided an estimate of the ground state binding of the analog of 187.3 ± 53.9 µm. A maximal rate of incorporation of ∼0.2 s−1 was estimated from the rate data for determination of the specificity constant for AZTTP incorporation. However, because the kinetics of incorporation for AZTTP differ from other analogs, these numbers do not simply relate tokcat and Km to define discrimination as do the data for other analogs (see “Discussion”). PMPA is a drug that is currently in third-phase clinical trial by Gilead Sciences. The kinetics of incorporation of PMPApp are shown in Fig. 6. PMPApp was incorporated at a maximum rate of 0.21 ± 0.01 s−1, with a ground state binding of 40.3 ± 5.7 µm. FIAU was developed to treat hepatitis B infection, but the severe side effects led to the death of five patients in the initial clinical trial (33McKenzie R. Fried M.W. Sallie R. Conjeevaram H.

Toxic side effects of FIAU have been shown by extensive studies to be related to mitochondrial toxicity (34Honkoop P. Scholte H.R. de Man R.A. Schalm S.W. Drug Saf. 1997; 17: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We analyzed incorporation, extension, and removal of FIAUTP by Pol γ to establish the kinetic parameters underlying the severe toxicity of this compound. Incorporation of FIAUTP occurred at a rate of 24 ± 2 s−1, with ground state binding of 2.9 ± 0.7 µm (Fig. 7). The rate of incorporation of this analog was the same as incorporation of the natural substrate, dTTP, with 5-fold weaker binding of the analog (0.63 µm ground state binding for dTTP (24Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar)) so that overall discrimination was only 4.8. Additionally, FIAUTP contains a 3′ OH that allows internalization of the analog into the DNA after formation of the next base pair. Incorporation of dCTP onto a primer containing a 3′ FIAUMP occurred at a rate of 0.13 ± 0.01 s−1 with a ground state nucleotide binding of 0.83 ± 0.20 µm(Fig. 8). Incorporation of dCTP after a natural nucleotide by Pol γ occurred at a rate of 43 s−1, with a Kd of 0.91 µm(24Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of FIAUMP had no effect on next correct nucleotide binding, but the rate of polymerization was decreased 300-fold, which may allow time for the exonuclease removal depending upon the rate of excision versus extension (see discussion). The important conclusion is that FAIU can be extended so that it beco"

The mechanisms by which cancer cells survive and escape the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents are essentially unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells, ligation of beta1 integrins by their extracellular matrix ligands inhibits significantly apoptosis induced by paclitaxel and vincristine, two microtubule-directed chemotherapeutic agents that are widely used in the therapy of breast cancer. We show that beta1 integrin signaling inhibits drug-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria in response to drug treatment. Further, integrin-mediated protection from drug-induced apoptosis and inhibition of cytochrome c release are dependent on the activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Our results identify beta1 integrin signaling as an important survival pathway in drug-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells and suggest that activation of this pathway may contribute to the generation of drug resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2067400935,"The epithelium to mesenchyme transition is thought to play a fundamental role during embryonic development and tumor progression. Loss of cell-cell adhesion and modification of both cell morphology and gene expression are the main events associated with this transition. There is a large amount of evidence suggesting that growth factors can initiate these events. Yet, the connection from growth factor induction to changes in cell adhesion and morphology is largely unknown. To elucidate this connection, we have investigated the action of IGF-II on E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex-mediated cell-cell adhesion and on beta-catenin/TCF-3 mediated gene expression. We can show that (1) IGF-II induces a rapid epithelium to mesenchymal transition; (2) IGF1R, the receptor for IGF-II, belongs to the same membrane complex as E-cadherin and beta-catenin; (3) IGF-II induces a redistribution of beta-catenin from the plasma membrane to the nucleus and an intracellular sequestration and degradation of E-cadherin; (4) IGF-II induces the transcription of beta-catenin/TCF-3 target genes. Based on the given case of IGF-II and E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex, this study reveals the backbone of a cascade connecting growth factor signaling with cell-cell adhesion during EMT."

The crystal structure of a beta:delta complex shows that delta, which is structurally related to the delta' and gamma subunits of the gamma complex, is a molecular wrench that induces or traps a conformational change in beta such that one of its dimer interfaces is destabilized. Structural comparisons and molecular dynamics simulations suggest a spring-loaded mechanism in which the beta ring opens spontaneously once a dimer interface is perturbed by the delta wrench."
https://openalex.org/W2090499247,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 is an autosomal dominant tumor syndrome. Manifestations include neoplasms of the parathyroid glands, enteropancreatic neuroendocrine cells, and the anterior pituitary gland. The MEN1 tumor suppressor gene encodes menin, a 610 amino acid nuclear protein without sequence homology to other proteins. To elucidate menin function, we used immunoprecipitation to identify interacting proteins. The NF-κB proteins p50, p52 and p65 were found to interact specifically and directly with menin in vitro and in vivo. The region of NF-κB proteins sufficient for binding to menin is the N-terminus. Furthermore, amino acids 305–381 of menin are essential for this binding. Menin represses p65-mediated transcriptional activation on NF-κB sites in a dose-dependent and specific manner. Also, PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate)-stimulated NF-κB activation is suppressed by menin. These observations suggest that menin's ability to interact with NF-κB proteins and its modulation of NF-κB transactivation contribute to menin's tumor suppressor function."
https://openalex.org/W2019589453,"The O-fucose modification is found on epidermal growth factor-like repeats of a number of cell surface and secreted proteins. O-Fucose glycans play important roles in ligand-induced receptor signaling. For example, elongation of O-fucose on Notch by the β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase Fringe modulates the ability of Notch to respond to its ligands. The enzyme that addsO-fucose to epidermal growth factor-like repeats, GDP-fucose protein O-fucosyltransferase (O-FucT-1), was purified previously from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.

A probe deduced from N-terminal sequence analysis of purified CHOO-FucT-1 was used to screen a human heart cDNA library and expressed sequence tag and genomic data bases. The cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 388 amino acids with a predicted N-terminal transmembrane sequence typical of a type II membrane orientation. Likewise, the mouse homolog obtained from an expressed sequence tag and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends of a mouse liver cDNA library encodes a type II transmembrane protein of 393 amino acids with 90.4% identity to humanO-FucT-1.

Although historically a major focus has been on determining the structure and function of N-glycans attached to asparagine residues, our knowledge of the scope and variety of serine/threonine-linked O-glycans has expanded greatly in the last decade. In addition to the well known mucin-typeO-GalNAc and glycosaminoglycan O-xylose classes of glycans, several others have been described, includingO-GlcNAc modification of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins (1Comer F.I.

Several recent publications demonstrate that these novel forms of protein O-glycosylation play interesting and significant roles in the biological functions of the proteins they modify (4Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5735-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 5Moloney D.J. Panin V.M.

Fucose in O-linkage to serine or threonine was originally identified in amino acid fucosides isolated from human urine (6Hallgren P. Lundblad A. Svensson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5312-5314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first protein reported to bear an O-fucose modification on an EGF repeat was urinary-type plasminogen activator (uPA) (7Kentzer E.J. Buko A.M. Menon G. Sarin V.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Several other proteins were subsequently found to have O-fucose modifications, and comparison of the sequences surrounding modified serines or threonines led to the proposal of a consensus sequence forO-fucose modification: C2 XXGGS/TC3, where C2 and C3 are the second and third conserved cysteine residues of the EGF repeat, X is any amino acid, and S/T is the modified serine or threonine (3Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Many proteins containing this sequence in the context of an EGF repeat have been identified in data base searches, and several of these proteins have subsequently been demonstrated to contain O-fucose residues (8Harris R.J.

O-Fucose glycans exist on glycoproteins as either a monosaccharide (Fuc-O-Ser/Thr), a tetrasaccharide (NeuAcα2, 3/6Galβ1, 4GlcNAcβ1, 3Fuc-O-Ser/Thr), or a di- or trisaccharide intermediate in tetrasaccharide biosynthesis (3Harris R.J.

Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Recent work from several laboratories has demonstrated a functional role for O-fucose glycans on the Notch protein. Fringe, a modulator of Notch signaling (11Irvine K.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), is an O-fucose β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that extends theO-fucose moieties on Notch (5Moloney D.J. Panin V.M.

Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Elongation ofO-fucose residues on EGF repeats of Notch by Fringe modulates Notch activation by the ligands Delta and Serrate/Jagged. Fringe potentiates signaling from Delta but inhibits signaling from Serrate/Jagged (13Panin V.M. Papayannopoulos V. Wilson R. Irvine K.D.

How the elongation of O-fucose residues on Notch mediates altered signaling is not yet understood, but the β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity is essential for Fringe to exert its effects on Notch (5Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 12Bruckner K.

These results demonstrate that the O-fucose modification plays a key role in regulating an important signal transduction event: activation of the Notch receptor. Another signaling reaction influenced by O-fucose is that of uPA and its receptor (16Rabbani S.A. Mazar A.P. Bernier S.M. Haq M. Bolivar I. Henkin J. Goltzman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14151-14156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BecauseO-fucose exists on a number of other biologically important proteins, it may also influence their functions. The enzyme responsible for adding O-fucose to EGF repeats (GDP-fucose protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 orO-FucT-1) was originally identified and purified from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (17Wang Y. Lee G.F. Kelley R.F. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interestingly,O-FucT-1 does not fucosylate synthetic peptides containing the C2 XXGGS/TC3 consensus sequence, but it does require a properly folded EGF repeat with the consensus sequence as acceptor (18Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A significant fraction ofO-FucT-1 activity in CHO cells is soluble, but it appears to be a membrane-bound protein released by proteolysis as observed with many other Golgi glycosyltransferases (19Kleene R. Berger E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev. Biomembr. 1993; 1154: 283-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). As with most glycosyltransferases, O-FucT-1 is strongly activated by manganese. It was purified more than 5,000-fold using affinity chromatography on columns made with acceptor substrate (recombinant EGF repeat from factor VII) and donor substrate (GDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose) (18Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this paper we present the N-terminal sequence for the CHO O-FucT-1 and its use in identifying a cDNA for human O-FucT-1. Transcripts of the gene (HGNC-approved symbol: POFUT1) are expressed in all human tissues examined, and homologous genes exist in mice, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans. These results are consistent with the widespread occurrence of theO-fucose modification on proteins. CHO O-FucT-1 was purified as described (18Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and 2 µg of purified enzyme was subjected to N-terminal peptide sequence analysis using a Hewlett-Packard model G1000A protein sequencer. Based on the peptide sequence of CHO O-FucT-1, a blast search was performed in GenBank (Unigene), and a human cDNA sequence, KIAA0180 (accession number D80002) was obtained which contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 366 amino acids. PCR primers were designed based on sequences from KIAA0180: kiaa 16–55 (5′-CTTCTTGGGCTCTCTGGCATTTGCAAAGCTGCTAAACCGT-3′) and kiaa 1110–1071 (5′-GCCCTGGGATATGGAGCGTCTCCCTCCTTGAGGGGTCCCT-3′). Using a human heart cDNA library (CLONTECH) as template, a 1.1-kb PCR product was obtained. A radiolabeled probe was generated from the PCR product by random priming, and the probe was used to screen the human heart cDNA library according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant λ DNA from purified positive clones was digested with EcoRI and subjected to Southern analysis. The probe for the Southern analysis was made from two partially overlapping oligonucleotides from the 5′-end of the KIAA0180 sequence (kiaa 16–55, see above, and kiaa 80–41, 5′-CAATCCAAGGAGGGACAGCCAAGGTACGGTTTAGCAGCTT-3′). The probe was filled in using Klenow fragment and 32P-labeled dNTPs.EcoRI fragments reacting with the probe were purified on agarose gels and subcloned into pBluescript II SK+ plasmid (Stratagene), and the resulting plasmids were sequenced. A clone containing the coding region of the POFUT1 gene was used for all subsequent experiments (pBS-hOFT). Additional 3′- and 5′-untranslated regions were determined by assembling overlappingPOFUT1 ESTs from dbEST and from the human genomic DNA sequence (accession number AL121897). To obtain the mouse sequence, KIAA0180 was used to search the mouse EST data base, and one EST (accession number AI664300, 460 base pairs) was found. To obtain 5′ sequence two primers (PS513, 5′-CCGTCCTCACCATCTCATCTGA-3′; and PS511, 5′-ACATGTCTTCTTATCAGGACTTCG-3′) based on this EST were used with Marathon-ready cDNA (CLONTECH) from mouse liver. From a 0.5-kb 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends product and the EST a 760-base pair sequence was obtained. The 3′-region was derived from mouse genomic DNA sequence (accession number AC078911) and was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR using primers, PS598 (5′-GGGACCAGTTTCATGTGAGTTTCAATAAGTCAGA-3′) and PS599 (5′-CCACCTCTGGCAGAAAAGAAAAGGGATGTGTAAT-3′) with Marathon-ready cDNA from liver (CLONTECH) as the template. The POFUT1 coding sequence was excised from pBS-hOFT using EcoRI and labeled by random priming using the Ready-to-Go kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech according to the manufacturer's instructions to a specific activity of 1 × 109 cpm/µg. A human multitissue RNA blot was purchased from CLONTECH, probed, and washed under high stringency conditions according to the manufacturer's instruction for cDNA probes. Baculovirus-mediated insect cell expression was used to express a soluble form of human O-FucT-1 (amino acids 24–388) with an N-terminal His6 tag. A baculovirus transfer vector with a signal peptide was generated from pVL1392HAX (20Ruppert S. Wang E.H. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 362: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Two complementary oligonucleotides (RS1, 5′-CATGGCCAAGTTCCTGGTCAACGTGGCCCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGTCCGGAGCCTGGGCCCA-3′; and RS2, 5′-TATGGGCCCAGGCTCCGGACAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGGGCCACGTTGACCAGGAACTTGGC-3′) encoding the signal sequence from honeybee melittin were generated and subcloned into the NcoI/NdeI site of pVL1392HAX. The resulting transfer vector was called pbSP. The coding sequence for the luminal domain of human POFUT1 was excised from pBS-hOFT using SacII and XbaI. Two complementary oligonucleotides (YW1, 5′-TGGGCCCATATGAGATCCCATCACCATCACCATCACATGCCCGCGGGCTCC-3′; and YW2, 5′-GGAGCCCGCGGGCATGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGGATCTCATATGGGCCCA-3′) encoding NdeI and SacII sites and the His6 sequence was used as linker for the cDNA and vector. The baculovirus transfer vector (pbSP) was cut withNdeI and SpeI (compatible with XbaI). A triple ligation was performed with pbSP, the excised cDNA, and the His6-encoding linker, and the resulting plasmid was transfected into Sf9 cells using the BaculoGold expression kit (Pharmingen). Recombinant viral clones were plaque purified three times. Viral stocks of 108 plaque-forming units/ml were prepared by repeated amplification. The protein was expressed by infecting 2 × 107 Sf9 cells with 5 × 108 plaque-forming units of recombinant virus. Medium was collected 72 h after infection, clarified by centrifugation, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and loaded onto a 0.5-ml Ni2+-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen). The column was washed with 4 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5m NaCl and eluted sequentially with 2 ml of 25 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.0, 0.5 m NaCl followed by 3 ml of 0.5 m imidazole HCl, pH 7.0. Each fraction was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, stained with silver and assayed for enzyme activity. O-FucT-1 activity was assayed using GDP-[3H]fucose and recombinant His6-tagged factor VII EGF domain as described (17Wang Y. Lee G.F. Kelley R.F. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All assays were performed as duplicates. N-terminal sequence analysis was performed on the purified protein as described above. Product analysis (reverse phase HPLC, β-elimination ofO-linked sugars, gel filtration using a Superdex column, and high pH anion exchange chromatographic analysis on a Dionex MA1 column) of fucosylated EGF repeat was performed as described (10Moloney D.J.

O-FucT-1 was purified from CHO cells as described (18Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. The N-terminal peptide sequence of 61 amino acids was obtained: RLAGSWDLAGYLLYXPXMGRFGNQADHFLGSLAFAKLXVRTLAVPPWIEYQHHKPPFTNLH, where cycles that yielded uncertain residues are marked asX. Blast searches with the sequence above revealed a cDNA, KIAA0180 (accession number D80002), coding for a 366-amino acid protein of unknown function from the human myeloblast cell line KG-1. Mammalian glycosyltransferases are typically type II transmembrane proteins (19Kleene R. Berger E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev. Biomembr. 1993; 1154: 283-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 21Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but computer analysis failed to find a transmembrane domain near the N terminus of the predicted human protein. To obtain a clone with a complete open reading frame, a human heart cDNA library was screened. Initially, a PCR fragment was obtained from the library using kiaa 16–55 and kiaa 1110–1071 as primers, and a probe was made from the PCR fragment using the random priming method. The human heart cDNA library was screened using this probe, and a number of clones were identified. DNA sequencing confirmed that they contained the KIAA0180 sequence with varying 5′-extensions. One clone extended the open reading frame upstream to an “ATG” that results in a protein with a classic type II transmembrane domain (accession number for cDNA AF375884). This 5′-sequence is present in the human genomic DNA sequence (accession number AL121897). Additional cDNA sequence including 3′- and 5′-untranslated regions were determined by assembling overlappingPOFUT1 ESTs from dbEST and from the human genome sequence. The human POFUT1 cDNA encodes a protein of 388 amino acids with a predicted type II transmembrane organization (Fig.1, accession number AF375884). The N-terminal sequence obtained from CHO O-FucT-1 begins at the end of the predicted transmembrane domain, suggesting that during purification, CHO O-FucT-1 was proteolyzed, as is typical of many glycosyltransferases, and consistent with the solubility properties of CHO O-FucT-1 (17Wang Y. Lee G.F. Kelley R.F. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The cDNA also contains an extensive 3′-untranslated region, typical of many glycosyltransferases (22Breton C. Imberty A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Two potential polyadenylation signals were found, providing an explanation for the existence of a doublet by Northern analysis (see below). To obtain a mouse POFUT1 cDNA sequence, KIAA0180 was used to search the mouse EST data base, and one EST (accession numberAI664300, 460 base pairs) was found. Two primers based on this EST sequence, PS513 and PS511, were used to amplify the 5′-region with Marathon-ready cDNA from mouse liver. By assembling the 0.5-kb PCR product and the EST, a 760-base pair sequence that encodes the N-terminal region of a protein with a typical type II transmembrane domain was obtained. The remaining 3′-coding sequence of mousePOFUT1 was derived from mouse genomic DNA sequence (accession number AC078911) and was confirmed by PCR using PS598 and PS599 with Marathon-ready cDNA from mouse liver. 15 nucleotide discrepancies between the cDNA sequence and the genomic DNA sequence included 7 that give amino acid changes. All 7 amino acid residues in the mouse cDNA are identical to the equivalent residue in the human POFUT1 sequence. The mouse POFUT1cDNA encodes a protein of 393 amino acids with a type II transmembrane domain (accession number AF375885). The full-length amino acid sequence of human O-FucT-1 was used to search the Drosophila and C. elegans data bases, and a related gene is present in both organisms (accession number AAF58290.1 for Drosophila and T15511 for C. elegans). The C. elegans POFUT1 gene includes 109 extra amino acids at the N terminus, which derives from three 5′-exons predicted by computer algorithm. These 109 amino acids represent an unusually long cytoplasmic domain for a glycosyltransferase and may or may not be present in the C. elegans O-FucT-1. NoPOFUT1 gene homologs were found in yeast or prokaryotes. Human and mouse O-FucT-1 are both type II transmembrane proteins and share a high level of identity (90.4%) (Fig.2), whereas the Drosophila andC. elegans homologs show 41.2 and 29.4% identity with humanO-FucT-1, respectively. Six cysteines and one potentialN-glycan consensus site are conserved, as well as the majority of aromatic residues. The CHO O-FucT-1 is known to be N-glycosylated (18Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting that valine in the CHO sequence at the predicted N-glycosylation site (Fig. 2) is probably the result of a sequencing error. A conserved DXD-like motif (ERD, see Fig. 2), found in many classes of glycosyltransferase (23Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), is located near the C terminus. Comparison of the humanPOFUT1 cDNA coding sequence with the genomic DNA sequence (accession number AL121897) revealed that humanPOFUT1 is organized into 7 exons (Fig.3A). The boundary sequences of the six exon/intron junctions are shown in Fig. 3 B. Previous analysis of the KIAA0180 sequence mapped it to human chromosome 20 ((24Kikuno R. Nagase T. Suyama M. Waki M. Hirosawa M. Ohara O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 331-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), www.kazusa.or.jp/huge/gfpage/KIAA0180/), and analysis of the BAC clone RP11-392M18 (accession number AL121897) shows thatPOFUT1 lies between PLAGL2 and KIF3B, close to the centromere of chromosome 20 at 20q11. The mousePofut1 gene has the same exon/intron organization as the human gene (data not shown), whereas the Drosophila andC. elegans Pofut1-related genes are organized differently (data not shown). Analysis of the BAC clone RP23-111A22 (accession number AC078911) from mouse chromosome 2 reveals thatPofut1 lies adjacent to Plagl2 in a region homologous with human chromosome 20. The mouse BAC clone terminates before the Kif3B gene predicted to followPofut1. Northern analysis showed major transcripts from the POFUT1 gene of ∼5 kb expressed at high levels in all human tissues examined (Fig.4). Several other weaker bands also hybridized, suggesting that there may be other transcripts expressed in some tissues. Previous analysis of the expression pattern of KIAA0180 ((22), www.kazusa.or.jp/huge/gfpage/KIAA0180/) showed a similar pattern of expression in spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes. They also showed resolution of the major transcripts into two species of ∼4.8 and 5.4 kb, consistent with the sizes predicted from the cDNA sequence using the two polyadenylation signals identified in the 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1). To demonstrate that the cloned POFUT1 cDNA encodes a protein withO-FucT-1 activity, a partial POFUT1 cDNA encoding the predicted O-FucT-1 luminal domain (amino acids 24–388, lacking the transmembrane domain) was cloned into a baculoviral expression plasmid containing an N-terminal signal sequence and His6 tag for expression in insect cells (Fig.5A). Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant virus, and the His6-tagged humanO-FucT-1 was purified from the medium using Ni2+-NTA-agarose. Fractions from the purification were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5 B) and for O-FucT-1 enzymatic activity (Fig. 5 C). The activity bound to the Ni2+-NTA-agarose column and eluted with imidazole. A 43-kDa protein coeluted with the activity (Fig. 5 B), in agreement with the predicted size of truncatedO-FucT-1. Amino terminal sequence analysis of the purified protein gave:XXRSHHHHHHMPAGSWDPAGYLLYXPXMGR, confirming that the expressed protein was the His6-tagged recombinant human O-FucT-1. Product characterization demonstrated that the secretedO-fucosyltransferase generated the correct product. Reverse phase HPLC analysis of 3H-fucosylated product showed that the radioactivity migrated exclusively with the factor VII EGF repeat (Fig. 6A), demonstrating that the [3H]fucose was covalently associated with the EGF repeat. The [3H]fucose was released from the EGF repeat by alkali-induced β-elimination forming the monosaccharide [3H]fucitol (Fig. 6, B and C), the expected product from the β-elimination of O-fucose in the presence of sodium borohydride. These results demonstrate that recombinant O-FucT-1 adds O-fucose to factor VII EGF repeat. To compare recombinant human O-FucT-1 with the purified CHO O-FucT-1 further, the dependence of activity on protein and substrate concentrations was examined (Fig.7). The kinetic parameters of human O-FucT-1 for the substrates factor VII EGF repeat and GDP-fucose compare favorably with the published values for purified CHOO-FucT-1. The Km obtained for factor VII EGF was 6 µm compared with 11 µm for CHO O-FucT-1 (18Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and for GDP-fucose, theKm was 4 µm compared with 5.9–6.4 µm for CHO O-FucT-1 (18Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). TheV max for recombinant human O-FucT-1 was 3 µmol/min·mg compared with 2.5 µmol/min·mg for CHOO-FucT-1 (18Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As noted for purified CHO O-FucT-1 (18Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), high concentrations of EGF repeat caused inhibition of fucose transfer by human O-FucT-1 (data not shown). In addition, human O-FucT-1 was inhibited by EDTA (data not shown), consistent with the manganese requirement of CHO O-FucT-1 activity (18Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the clonedPOFUT1 cDNA encodes the O-FucT-1 glycosyltransferase. The O-fucose modification has been found on proteins from a wide variety of species, ranging from humans to fruit flies (3Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar,5Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), and a protein O-fucosyltransferase that generates the modification has been purified from CHO cells (18Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this paper we report the sequences of human and mouse cDNAs that encodeO-FucT-1 and the organization of the human POFUT1gene. The POFUT1 gene sequence is highly conserved in mammals and is also present in Drosophila and C. elegans. The gene is expressed in all mammalian tissues examined, suggesting that the O-fucose modification may play biological roles in different contexts. O-FucT-1 has a predicted type II transmembrane structure, consistent with the domain organization of nearly all known mammalian Golgi glycosyltransferases (19Kleene R. Berger E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev. Biomembr. 1993; 1154: 283-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 21Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the membrane association data of the enzyme (17Wang Y. Lee G.F. Kelley R.F. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).O-FucT-1 does not share any obvious sequence similarity with any other class of glycosyltransferases, including the α1,2, α1,3/4, or α1,6-fucosyltransferases (22Breton C. Imberty A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Six highly conserved cysteines are present in O-FucT-1 as well as a DXD-like motif (ERD), conserved in mammals,Drosophila, and C. elegans. Both features are characteristic of several glycosyltransferase families (22Breton C. Imberty A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 23Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Only one homologous gene has been identified for each species. The presence of O-fucose on EGF repeats is known to play a critical role in signal transduction through two distinct pathways. Binding of uPA to the uPA receptor is mediated through the EGF repeat of uPA (16Rabbani S.A. Mazar A.P. Bernier S.M. Haq M. Bolivar I. Henkin J. Goltzman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14151-14156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Appella E. Robinson E.A. Ullrich S.J. Stoppelli M.P. Corti A. Cassini G. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4437-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of O-fucose from the EGF repeat has no effect on binding to the uPA receptor, but bound, unfucosylated EGF repeat does not activate the receptor. Thus, the O-fucose modification is not required for binding, but it plays an essential role in activation of the uPA receptor. The details of howO-fucose mediates this effect are not understood, but it is known that the addition of O-fucose to an EGF repeat does not significantly alter the conformation of the polypeptide chain. Using NMR, Kao and co-workers (26Kao Y.-H. Lee G.F. Wang Y. Starovasnik M.A. Kelley R.F. Spellman M.W. Lerner L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7097-7110Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) examined the structure of the factor VII EGF repeat with and without an O-fucose. The presence of the O-fucose had very little effect on the tertiary structure of the EGF repeat, but it did form a significant knob-like feature on one face of the module. Thus, modification of the protein with O-fucose would not be predicted to cause a conformational change in the protein, but it could certainly affect the interactions of the EGF repeat with other molecules. In the Notch signaling pathway, O-fucose also plays a key role in receptor activation. O-Fucose serves as an acceptor for Fringe, a β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, resulting in the elongation of the O-fucose monosaccharide into a tetrasaccharide on EGF repeats of Notch (5Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 12Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). This alteration in the carbohydrate structure somehow modulates receptor activation. Interestingly, the activation of Notch can be either potentiated or inhibited, depending on the ligand (13Panin V.M. Papayannopoulos V. Wilson R. Irvine K.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 14Fleming R.J. Gu Y. Hukriede N.A. Development. 1997; 124: 2973-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Again, it is unlikely that the change in sugar structure alters the conformation of the individual EGF repeat, but such a change could certainly affect the ability of the modified EGF repeat to interact with ligands, other proteins, or even other portions of the Notch protein itself. Recently the presence of O-fucose in a different protein context was reported (27Hofsteenge J. Huwiler K.G. Macek B. Hess D. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Peter-Katalinic J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6485-6498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Hofsteenge and co-workers showed the presence of the disaccharide Glc-Fuc O-linked to serines and threonines within the three thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSR) of human thrombospondin-1. By comparing the sequence contexts surrounding the modified residues in each TSR they proposed the consensus sequence, CSX S/TCG, where S/T is the modified residue. AnO-linked Glcβ1,3Fuc modification of proteins in CHO cells has also been described (28Moloney D.J. Lin A.I. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19046-19050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), although CHO proteins with this modification were not identified. The results of Hofsteenge and co-workers suggest that two separate O-fucose pathways exist: one modifying EGF repeats, and the other modifying TSRs. Elongation of O-fucose occurs in both pathways, but the elongation does not appear to overlap. O-Fucose on EGF repeats can be modified by a β1,3-linked GlcNAc, catalyzed by Fringe (5Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 12Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), whereas O-fucose on TSRs appears to be elongated by a β1,3-linked Glc (27Hofsteenge J. Huwiler K.G. Macek B. Hess D. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Peter-Katalinic J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6485-6498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). An enzymatic activity capable of addition of Glc in a β1,3-linkage to fucose has been described (9Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the β1,3-glucosyltransferase would not useO-fucose attached to an EGF repeat as a substrate under various conditions tested, 2D. J. Moloney and R. S. Haltiwanger, unpublished observation.suggesting that the addition of the Glc to fucose occurs only when the fucose is in a particular protein context such as a TSR. The region of thrombospondin-1 modified with the Glc-Fuc disaccharide binds to heparin and appears to be involved in a number of biologically important interactions (29Adams J.C. Tucker R.P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), raising the interesting possibility that this class of O-fucose modifications may modulate biological events in a manner similar to O-fucose on the Notch receptor. The importance of fucose modifications on proteins has been highlighted recently by the description of the disease leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II (30Becker D.J. Lowe J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Patients with this disorder have reduced levels of fucose on proteins. The underfucosylation is caused by defects in the GDP-fucose transporter resulting in inefficient transport of GDP-fucose into the Golgi apparatus (31Lubke T. Marquardt T. von Figura K. Korner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25986-25989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 32Luhn K. Wild M.K. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Vestweber D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The patients suffer from a wide variety of developmental and pathological problems (30Becker D.J. Lowe J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As the name of the disorder implies, they have a defect in recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation, resulting in severe recurring bacterial infections. Leukocytes are recruited to sites of inflammation by recognition of specific fucose-containing oligosaccharide structures on their surfaces, and reduced levels of fucose impair efficient recruitment (33McEver R.P. Glycoconjugate J. 1997; 14: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In addition to recurrent infections, these patients suffer from developmental abnormalities. They are short in stature, have unusual facial and skeletal abnormalities, and are severely mentally retarded. Because Notch receptors play key roles in numerous developmental events (34Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4951) Google Scholar), it may be that several of the other features of leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II can be explained by defects in Notch function."

In humans and a variety of animal species Toxoplasma can cause severe infections, especially when the immune system is immature or compromised (1Frenkel J.K. Parasitol.

Toxoplasma is a member of a larger class of apicomplexan parasites, which also includes the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and has been found to be a suitable model system for the study of its other members. As it is an obligate intracellular parasite, it is necessary forToxoplasma to gain access to the inside of host cells. It does this by secreting one or more adhesin-like molecules that promote its binding to host cells (2Garcia-Reguet N. Lebrun M. Fourmaux M.N. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Mann T. Beckers C.J. Samyn B.

The ensuing invasion process is only poorly understood, other than that it requires an actin-based motility system (4Dobrowolski J.M. Sibley L.D.

Microbiol. 1997; 26: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and that it is active on the part of the parasite and does not involve host cell processes like endocytosis or phagocytosis (6Joiner K.A. Fuhrman S.A. Miettinen H.M. Kasper L.H. Mellman I. Science. 1990; 249: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Upon invading the host cell, Toxoplasma forms a vacuole inside the host cytoplasm that resides throughout its stay in the host cell. The origin of the lipids for the parasitophorous vacuole is unclear at this time, but it is known that host cell proteins are excluded and that a variety of parasite proteins are inserted into the membrane (6Joiner K.A. Fuhrman S.A. Miettinen H.M. Kasper L.H. Mellman I. Science. 1990; 249: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 7Mordue D.G. Desai N. Dustin M. Sibley L.D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The parasitophorous vacuole membrane is permeable to molecules with molecular weights less than 1500, giving the parasite access to the low molecular weight nutrients present in the host cytoplasm (8Schwab J.C. Beckers C.J.M. Joiner K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Little is also understood about the mechanism of Toxoplasmaegress from infected cells. It is quite evident that parasites such asToxoplasma must have the ability to sense that their host cell is dead or dying, to prevent themselves from either withering away inside a dead cell or being destroyed along with the dead cell by host macrophages. Thus far, the only clues to the mechanism used byToxoplasma to regulate its egress from infected cells have come from observations made with two compounds that induce this process artificially. Calcium ionophores, such as A23187, have been found to be effective inducers of Toxoplasma egress (9Endo T. Sethi K.K. Piekarski G. Exp. Parasitol. 1982; 53: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that alterations in the concentration of calcium in either the host cell or the parasite are involved in inducing parasite egress. Recently,Toxoplasma mutants have been isolated that display a delayed response to ionophore-induced parasite egress (10Black M.W. Arrizabalaga G. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9399-9408Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Similarly, the treatment of Toxoplasma-infected cells with the strong reducing agent DTT1 results in the rapid egress of the parasites (11Stommel E.W. Ely K.H. Schwartzman J.D. Kasper L.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of DTT is not clear but may involve the artificial activation of parasitic nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases (12Silverman J.A. Qi H. Riehl A. Beckers C. Nakaar V. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12352-123529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To circumvent questions about the physiological relevance of observations made during the artificial induction ofToxoplasma egress, we decided to monitor normal egress of the parasite from infected cells. We found that the plasma membrane of the host cell becomes permeable 2–3 min prior to actual parasite egress. Apparently, the change in ionic environment in the host cytoplasm that ensues is the trigger for parasite egress. We have analyzed the specific ion concentration sensed in this process and determined it to be the intracellular, extraparasitic [K+]. Fura-PE3/AM was obtained from TEFLABS (Austin, TX). Pluronic F127, gramicidin, and ethidium homodimer were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Saccharomyces aureusα-toxin, gramicidin, BAPTA/AM, U73122, U73343, and A23187 were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All other chemicals used were obtained from Fisher Scientific Co. (Pittsburgh, PA) or Sigma. The indicated pH values were obtained at 25 °C. Standard extracellular (EC) buffer consisted of 141.8 mm NaCl, 5.8 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2. Extracellular buffer lacking NaCl (EC-NaCl) was identical to EC buffer but with all NaCl replaced by choline-Cl. Extracellular buffer lacking CaCl2 (EC-Ca) was identical to EC buffer but contained 2 mm EGTA instead of the 1 mm CaCl2. Extracellular buffer lacking all chloride (EC-chloride) was identical to EC buffer but Na and K-glutamate replaced NaCl and KCl and MgSO4 replaced MgCl2. Standard intracellular (IC) buffer consisted of 5 mm NaCl, 142 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2. Intracellular buffer lacking all chloride (IC-Cl) was identical to IC buffer but Na- and K-glutamate replaced NaCl and KCl and MgSO4 replaced MgCl2. In experiments where the egress response to different [KCl] was determined the total concentration of monovalent cations in IC buffer was maintained at 140 mm by the addition of choline-Cl. Intracellular buffer lacking all K+ (IC-K) was identical to IC buffer but KCl was replaced by choline-Cl. In some experiments, EC and IC buffers were supplemented with essential and non-essential amino acids to concentrations normally found in α-minimal essential medium, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP or with 2 mm reduced glutathione. Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were grown in α-minimal essential medium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). The RH-ΔHX of T. gondii was obtained from Dr. David Roos. To construct the RH-EGFP strain, the EGFP open reading was amplified from pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by polymerase chain reaction and cloned between the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of theToxoplasma SAG1 gene. This construct was electroporated into the RH-ΔHX strain and transformants were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. All parasite strains were propagated in confluent monolayers of HFF cells as described. Chambers for monitoring parasite egress were prepared by cutting a 10-mm hole in the bottom of 30-mm tissue culture dishes (Corning) and covering these with 22-mm diameter glass coverslips using silicone glue. HFF cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 per cm2 onto these dishes. After 6–8 h, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of growth medium containing 105 freshly isolated parasites per ml. The cells and parasites were incubated for 30 h at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator with 5% CO2. At this time, there was little evidence of host cell lysis and there were few extracellular parasites. Approximately 50% of the host cells were infected and had between one and three parasitophorous vacuoles, each containing 16–32 parasites. Cells were washed three times in EC buffer and incubated 30 min at room temperature in EC buffer containing 5 µm of the ratiometric Ca2+-indicator fura-PE3/AM (Teflabs, Austin, TX). Cells were washed twice in EC buffer. Ratiometric [Ca2+]C measurements and time-lapse photography were performed as described before (13Manning Jr., T.J. Sontheimer H. GLIA. 1997; 20: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using a Nikon Diaphot 200 inverted epifluorescence microscope and ×20 or ×40 objectives. During observation, cells and solutions were maintained at 37 °C. Typically 2–3 egress events could be detected per ×20 field in the first 30 min. The number of events decreased sharply after that, possibly due to photodamage. Using intact host cells, we never observed accumulation of fura-PE3 in the parasites. This is not surprising as the fura-PE3/AM is hydrolyzed by esterases in the host cytoplasm to the membrane-impermeable fura-PE3, which is thereby prevented from crossing into the parasite. Parasites were isolated from infected HFF monolayers by scraping into IC buffer, passed once through a 21-gauge needle and filtered through a 3-µm Nucleopore filter (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA). The parasites were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 rpm and resuspended in IC buffer at a concentration of 0.5–1 × 109/ml. Fura-PE3/AM was added to a final concentration of 5 µmand the suspension incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The parasites were washed once by centrifugation as described above and resuspended in IC buffer at a final concentration of 1 × 108/ml. An 2-ml aliquot of parasites was placed in the cuvette of a fluorescence measurements were performed in fluorescence spectrophotometer (Photon Technologies Inc.,) with 2 ml of parasites in a cuvette in a temperature-controlled chamber equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The fluorescence intensity was measured at 510 nm with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm. [Ca2+]C was calculated as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (14Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar): [Ca2+]C =Kd × [R −Rmin]/[Rmax −R] ×Sf2/Sb2, whereKd is the fura dissociation constant for calcium (224 nm), R is the ratio of intensities at 340 and 380 nm, and Rmin andRmax are the R values 0 and saturating levels of calcium, respectively.Sf2/Sb2 is the ratio of the intensities at 380 nm excitation underRmin and Rmaxconditions. HFF cells were infected as described. After 30 h, infected cultures were transferred to room temperature and gently washed three times with IC buffer. An aliquot of S. aureus α-toxin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was rapidly thawed and diluted to 1 µg/ml in IC buffer. Immediately, the remaining buffer was aspirated carefully off the infected cells and a 1-ml aliquot of diluted α-toxin was placed on the cells. As judged by trypan blue and ethidium homodimer exclusion, host cells were permeabilized within 5 min after toxin addition. After 30 min incubation at room temperature, the α-toxin solution was aspirated and the cells washed three times in the buffer of choice. The α-toxin-treated cells were transferred for 30 min to 37 °C and egress was monitored by phase-contrast microscopy or by fluorescence microscopy when using EGFP-expressing parasites. The number of vacuoles containing 2 or more parasites per 10 fields at a ×400 magnification was counted prior to permeabilization and at the end of each stage. The percent egress was determined by dividing the number of vacuoles remaining at the end of each stage by the number found prior to permeabilization. Toxoplasma was not permeabilized by treatment with α-toxin as judged by exclusion of trypan blue and ethidium homodimer. Permeabilization of host cells with streptolysin O gave identical results during short-term incubations although cell integrity was affected to a larger extent after prolonged incubations. Attempts to use digitonin or saponin were not successful as no conditions could be identified that resulted reproducibly in the permeabilization of the host plasma membrane without affecting the parasite. Changes in cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]C) in the host cell have been implicated in the activation of Toxoplasma egress in a number of studies. It was found by Stommel et al. (11Stommel E.W. Ely K.H. Schwartzman J.D. Kasper L.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) that the artificial induction of Toxoplasma egress by DTT led to a transient increase in [Ca2+]C in the host cell prior to actual egress and Black et al. (10Black M.W. Arrizabalaga G. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9399-9408Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) described that Toxoplasma egress required an increased [Ca2+]C in the host cell. Endo et al. (9Endo T. Sethi K.K. Piekarski G. Exp. Parasitol. 1982; 53: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) found that treatment of Toxoplasma-infected host cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 results in a rapid induction of parasite egress. To establish whether increases in host cell [Ca2+]C were also involved in the normal, uninduced, egress process, we loadedToxoplasma-infected cells with the calcium indicator fura-PE3/AM. As the fura-PE3/AM is hydrolyzed to the membrane-impermeable fura-PE3 by esterases in the host cytoplasm, the dye is prevented from crossing into the intracellular parasites and thus allowing us to monitor [Ca2+]C changes solely in the host cell. Under our loading conditions, we never observed accumulation of this dye in the intracellular parasites themselves. Fura-PE3-loaded, Toxoplasma-infected cells were monitored simultaneously for changes in [Ca2+]C and parasite egress. Although we did detect an increase in host cell [Ca2+]C 2–3 min prior toToxoplasma egress (Fig.1A), apparently similar to what had been reported previously for DTT-induced parasite egress (11Stommel E.W. Ely K.H. Schwartzman J.D. Kasper L.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we do not believe this to be a specific signaling event. In quantitating changes in fura-PE3 fluorescence during this process, we noticed that concomitant with the transient increase in [Ca2+]C fura-PE3 fluorescence per se decreased rapidly (Fig. 1B), indicating that the fura-PE3 was leaking out of the cell. This suggests that the transient increase in host cell [Ca2+]C was in fact due to a non-selective increase in permeability of the host plasma membrane followed by an influx of Ca2+ from the medium. This was confirmed by repeating the experiment in the absence of extracellular calcium. Under these conditions, the transient increase in [Ca2+]C was not observed but the host cell plasma membrane still became permeable to fura-PE3 several minutes prior to parasite egress (data not shown). Based on these observations we conclude that the plasma membrane of the host cell becomes permeable to small molecules 2–3 min prior to Toxoplasma egress. Our attempts to determine whether the plasma membrane becomes permeable to protein-size molecules have been inconclusive thus far, probably in part due to their slower diffusion rates and possible interaction with other cytoplasmic components. The increase in non-selective permeability of the host cell plasma membrane should result in marked change in the intracellular environment with respect to all lowMr components. As the parasitophorous vacuole, the structure parasites reside in during their stay inside host cells, is permeable to molecules with a Mr up to about 150,000 (8Schwab J.C. Beckers C.J.M. Joiner K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), a change in small molecule composition of the host cell would result in the parasites' environment changing drastically as well. As changes in cytoplasmic conditions on this order of magnitude normally only accompany severe cell damage and cell death, we reasoned that it might in fact be the trigger parasites needed to initiate egress from the damaged cell. To test this hypothesis, we permeabilized the plasma membranes of Toxoplasma-infected cells artificially with S. aureus α-toxin, as this would allow us to manipulate the environment surrounding intracellular parasites with respect to small molecules. Under the conditions used, the plasma membrane of the parasite itself was intact. Based on the available data on the composition of mammalian cells and typical tissue culture media, we were able to devise a list of the intracellular changes expected to occur after permeabilization of the host cell. Increases were expected to occur in the concentration of sodium (from 5 to 140 mm), calcium (from 1 µm to 1 mm), and chloride (from 20 to 140 mm). Decreases were expected in the case of potassium (140 mm to 5 mm), ATP and GTP (1 to 0 mm). In addition, changes in the cytoplasmic concentration of numerous small molecules (amino acids, nucleotides, etc.) were also to be expected, as well as a change in redox potential. Initially we focused on changes that should occur in the major anions and cations of the cytoplasm. To test whether changes in any of these could trigger parasite egress, we artificially permeabilizedToxoplasma-infected cells with S. aureusα-toxin in isoosmotic buffers that varied only with respect to the concentrations of the different components listed above. When permeabilized, parasite-infected cells were incubated in a buffer that resembles the extracellular medium (EC buffer),Toxoplasma egressed rapidly from the cells, with only 3–12% of the vacuoles remaining after 10 min (Fig.2B). In contrast, when infected cells were permeabilized in a buffer with an ionic composition similar to the cytoplasm (IC buffer), no egress was observed over a period of several hours (Fig. 2F). This lack of egress is not due to toxicity of the buffer as parasites can be induced to egress, after a 2-h incubation in this buffer, by simply switching the cells to the extracellular buffer (results not shown). As the presence or absence of amino acids, nucleotides, and glutathione had no effect on parasite egress, we concluded that parasite egress is triggered by a change in concentration of one of the simple anions or cations present in the extracellular or intracellular environment. Based on the experiments shown in Fig. 2, B andF, Toxoplasma egress could be triggered by the changes of [Ca2+], [Na+], [Cl−], or [K+] from intracellular to extracellular levels that occur after host plasma membrane breakdown. To test whether a change in the concentration of a specific ion could trigger egress, we performed egress experiments in isoosmotic buffers in which the concentration of only a single ion was changed at a time. It is clear from comparing Fig. 2, B and C, that the presence or absence of Ca2+ in its surrounding medium has no effect on Toxoplasma egress. Similarly, when using buffers in which all Na+ was replaced by choline (EC-Na) (Fig. 2D), or all Cl − replaced by glutamate (EC-Cl) (Fig. 2E), egress was not affected. The only ion that appears to matter in this respect is K+. Irrespective of other ions present, if [K+] is similar to cytoplasmic levels egress does not occur, whereas at low [K+] or in its absence egress is very efficient. These data suggest that of all the changes that occur in the parasites' environment during the breakdown of the host cell, it is the reduction of [K+] that triggers actual egress. To determine if a threshold [K+] exists below which egress is triggered we incubated permeabilized,Toxoplasma-infected HFF cells in a series of buffers containing decreasing [K+] for 15 or 30 min. In these experiments, the total concentration of monovalent cations was maintained by the addition of choline-Cl. As can be seen in Fig.3, egress is negligible, even over extended incubation times, until the [K+] drops to below 100 mm. Whereas egress is detectable at that concentration, efficient egress does not occur until the [K+] drops to 80 mm, indicating the existence of a distinct threshold below which the [K+] needs to drop before the egress machinery of Toxoplasma is fully activated. One of the mechanisms in the parasite that needs to be activated in order for egress to occur is the motile apparatus. It has been shown by a number of investigators that an elevated [Ca2+]C in the parasite is required for this process. To test whether an increase in [Ca2+]C in the parasite is also required during egress, Toxoplasma-infected cells were permeabilized with α-toxin in intracellular buffer and subsequently incubated in the same buffer with or without the membrane-permeable calcium chelator BAPTA/AM. These cells were then transferred to extracellular buffer for 30 min and assayed for egress. As can be seen from comparing Fig.4, A and B, and Table I, loading the parasites with BAPTA/AM completely prevents Toxoplasma egress, indicating that Toxoplasma egress from infected cells indeed involves an increase in [Ca2+]C in the parasite.Table IThe effect of medium composition and pharmacological reagents on Toxoplasma egressIncubationsEgress (%)Stage 1Stage 2Stage 3Stage 1Stage 2Stage 3ICEC692NDICEC-Ca2+391NDICEC-Na+490NDICEC-Cl−488NDICICIC + A231876595IC + BAPTA/AMECEC + A231874931IC + U73122EC +U73122EC + U73122 + A231877992IC + U73343EC +U73343693NDIC + CytDEC + CytDEC + CytD +A23187444IC + FCEECEC + A231875911IC + KT5926EC + KT5926EC + KT5926 + A231874810IC + valinomycinEC + valinomycin91IC + gramicidinEC + gramicidin89 Open table in a new tab These data suggest that a drop in extraparasitic [K+] triggers the transient increase in [Ca2+]Cthat in turn activates the parasites' egress machinery. To determine whether egress is controlled in its entirety by [Ca2+]C or whether other essential regulatory pathways are activated as well, we asked whether the need for a drop in extracellular [K+] could be circumvented by treating permeabilized Toxoplasma-infected cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 while in intracellular buffer. As can be seen in Fig.4C and Table I, addition of the ionophore did indeed result in parasite egress, suggesting that the mechanism that detects the decrease in extracellular [K+] only activates egress through the regulation of [Ca2+]C. To further test this hypothesis we directly monitored changes in [Ca2+]C inToxoplasma during a decrease in extraparasitic [K+]. We first attempted to perform this experimentin situ in permeabilized infected cells. Due to the small size of the parasites and their rapid movement upon activation of egress, we were unable to obtain reliable information on changes in [Ca2+]C. To circumvent this problem, parasites were isolated from infected cells in IC buffer and loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fura-PE3/AM in the same buffer. As long as the parasites remained in the intracellular buffer, no changes were observed in [Ca2+]C in the parasites (Fig. 5). Immediately after diluting the parasites with an equal volume of IC buffer containing choline-Cl instead of KCl, which reduces the [K+] to below the threshold value for egress, a transient increase in the [Ca2+]C in the parasite from about 60 to ∼400 nm could be observed. This increase lasted for several minutes after which [Ca2+]C returned to normal. Dilution of the parasites in intracellular buffer did not result in a change in [Ca2+]C. The increase in [Ca2+]Ccan be a result of calcium influx into the cytoplasm from the extracellular environment or from stores located in the cytoplasm. Based on the experiment shown in Fig. 2, it is clear that extracellular calcium is not required for parasite egress and that the source for the calcium must lie within the parasite. It is not known, at this time, what the exact nature is of the intracellular calcium stores inToxoplasma and the mechanism of calcium release into the cytoplasm. In the related parasite P. falciparum the presence of an intracellular calcium store has been described that can release calcium in response to increases in levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, in a manner analogous to that found in many mammalian cells. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is normally generated by the action of activated phospholipase C on the membrane phospholipid phosphatidyl-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate. To test whether the elevation of [Ca2+]C that occurs inToxoplasma upon reduction of the extraparasitic [K+], we permeabilized Toxoplasma-infected cells in intracellular buffer and incubated them in the same buffer with the specific phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 (15Thompson A.K. Mostafapour S.P. Denlinger L.C. Bleasdale J.E. Fisher S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23856-23862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the cells were placed in extracellular buffer no egress was observed (Fig.4D, and Table I). The IC50 for the effect of this compound on parasite egress was found to be ∼1 µm(Table II), similar to that reported for known phospholipase C activities (15Thompson A.K. Mostafapour S.P. Denlinger L.C. Bleasdale J.E. Fisher S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23856-23862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation of the cells withU73343, an inactive homologue of U73122, had no effect on parasite egress (Table I). To test involvement of host cell phospholipase C in parasite egress, we added exogenous inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, a water soluble product generated upon activation of phospholipase C, or GTPγS, an activator of phospholipase C in permeabilized cells, to permeabilized host cells. As neither had an effect onToxoplasma egress (data not shown), we conclude that the effect of U73122 on Toxoplasma egress is due to inhibition of a phospholipase C activity in the parasite. To determine whether phospholipase C was involved, as expected, in the regulation of [Ca2+]C during egress or a downstream process, we incubated U73122-treated cells with the ionophore A32187 to raise [Ca2+]C artificially and independently of PLC. As can be seen in Fig. 4D and Table I, addition ofA23187 indeed overcomes the inhibition of parasite egress by the PLC inhibitor U73122 confirming that the increase in [Ca2+]C during parasite egress is regulated by a PLC activity in the parasite.Table IIC50 values of various compounds for Toxoplasma egressInhibitorIC50µmU731220.9U73343>20KT59260.12KN93>10Cyclosporin-A0.2Toxoplasma-infected cells were permeabilized with S. aureus α-toxin in IC buffer and incubated in different concentrations of the different inhibitors in IC buffer for 30 min at 37 °C.

This modification targets Mdm2 and p53 for degradation by the proteasome. The p14ARF tumour suppressor has been shown to inhibit degradation of p53 mediated by Mdm2. Several models have been proposed to explain this effect of p14ARF. Here we have compared the effects of p14ARF overexpression on the in vivo ubiquitination of p53 and Mdm2. We report that the inhibition of the Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53 by p14ARF is associated with a decrease in the proportion of ubiquitinated p53. The levels of polyubiquitinated p53 decreased preferentially compared to monoubiquitinated species. p14ARF overexpression increased the levels of Mdm2 but it did not reduce the overall levels of ubiquitinated Mdm2 in vivo. This is unexpected because p14ARF has been reported to inhibit the ubiquitination of Mdm2 in vitro. In addition we show that like p14ARF, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 can promote the accumulation of Mdm2 in the nucleolus and that this can occur in the absence of p14ARF expression. We also show that the mutation of the nucleolar localization signal of Mdm2 does not impair the overall ubiquitination of Mdm2 but is necessary for the effective polyubiquitination of p53. These studies reveal important differences in the regulation of the stability of p53 and of Mdm2."

Similarly, in vitro translated NCS-1, but not its myristoylation-defective mutant, was found associated with recombinant- or in vitro translated PI4Kβ in PI4Kβ-immunoprecipitates. When expressed in COS-7 cells, PI4Kβ and NCS-1 formed a complex that could be immunoprecipitated with antibodies against either proteins, and PI 4-kinase activity was present in anti-NCS-1 immunoprecipitates. Expressed NCS-1-YFP showed co-localization with endogenous PI4Kβ primarily in the Golgi, but it was also present in the walls of numerous large perinuclear vesicles. Co-expression of a catalytically inactive PI4Kβ inhibited the development of this vesicular phenotype. Transfection of PI4Kβ and NCS-1 had no effect on basal PIP synthesis in permeabilized COS-7 cells, but it increased the wortmannin-sensitive [32P]phosphate incorporation into phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate during Ca2+-induced phospholipase C activation.

When expressed in COS-7 cells, PI4Kβ and NCS-1 formed a complex that could be immunoprecipitated with antibodies against either proteins, and PI 4-kinase activity was present in anti-NCS-1 immunoprecipitates. Expressed NCS-1-YFP showed co-localization with endogenous PI4Kβ primarily in the Golgi, but it was also present in the walls of numerous large perinuclear vesicles. Co-expression of a catalytically inactive PI4Kβ inhibited the development of this vesicular phenotype. Transfection of PI4Kβ and NCS-1 had no effect on basal PIP synthesis in permeabilized COS-7 cells, but it increased the wortmannin-sensitive [32P]phosphate incorporation into phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate during Ca2+-induced phospholipase C activation. These results together indicate that NCS-1 is able to interact with PI4Kβ also in mammalian cells and may play a role in the regulation of this enzyme in specific cellular compartments affecting vesicular trafficking. phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate 5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase neuronal calcium sensor-1 gluthathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline green fluorescent protein Inositol lipid kinases are increasingly recognized as regulators of membrane remodeling events whether in Golgi-related transport, endocytosis, or exocytosis (1Martin T.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These enzymes catalyze the formation of specific inositol phospholipids, which, in turn, contributes to the membrane recruitment and stabilization of molecular complexes via interaction of inositides with protein motifs present in several regulatory proteins. Phosphatidylinositol (PI)1 4-kinases (PI4Ks) are the enzymes that catalyze the formation of PI(4)P, the main precursor of several other polyphosphoinositides with important regulatory functions. PI 4-kinase activities have been characterized some 15–20 years ago and have been classified as type II and type III enzymes, based on their catalytic properties (2Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11147-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Molecular identification of these proteins has been relatively slow, but two forms of type III PI4Ks have been cloned from various species. These enzymes, a larger (∼200 kDa) α, and a smaller (∼100 kDa) β form, are mammalian homologues of the yeast STT4 and PIK1 gene products, respectively, and are greatly conserved in all eukaryotes, including plants (3Fruman D.A.

Stt4 has been shown to participate in cell wall synthesis, while Pik1 is involved in Golgi-related trafficking (8Trotter P.J. Wu W.-I. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

In mammalian cells, PI4Kβ is primarily localized to the Golgi (11Wong K. Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

The function(s) and exact site(s) of PI4Kα action(s) still await clarification. Both of these enzymes can be inhibited in mammalian cells by micromolar concentrations of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, and at these higher concentrations, wortmannin completely inhibits the resynthesis of PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 in agonist-stimulated cells. This observation led to the assumption that hormone-sensitive inositide pools are also synthesized by type III PI 4-kinase(s) (13Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Both the α and β forms are present in high concentrations in the brain and may participate in the membrane recycling events that are associated with synaptic transmission, since phosphoinositides have also been implicated in this process (14Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A. McCormick D.A. De Camilli P. Cell. 1999; 99: 179-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar).Recently, it has been reported that the yeast homologue of the Ca2+-dependent regulatory protein, NCS-1, is able to stimulate PI 4-kinase activity of yeast homogenates apparently through interaction with the Pik1 protein (15Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). NCS-1 was first identified in Drososphila (where it was named frequenin) as an important determinant of synaptic plasticity and a regulator of synaptic development (16Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Engelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.-G. Koch K.W. Schwemer J. Rivosecchi R. Mallart A. Galceran J. Canal I. Barbas J.A. Ferrus A. Neuron. 1993; 11: 15-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Homologues of NCS-1 have been found inXenopus (17Olafsson P. Wang T. Lu B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 92: 8001-8005Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as well as in avian (18Nef S. Fiumelli H. de Castro E. Raes M.B. Nef P. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and mammalian tissues (19Martone M.E. Edelmann V.M. Ellisman M.H. Nef P. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 295: 395-407Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and together with recoverin/neurocalcin they form a group of small Ca2+-binding proteins distinct from calmodulin (20Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to investigate whether mammalian NCS-1 is able to interact and regulate PI4Kβ in mammalian cells. Our results indicate that the two proteins can directly interact in vitro and that NCS-1 exerts a moderate stimulatory effect on the lipid kinase activity of PI4Kβ. The present data also show that myristoylation of NCS-1 is critical for its ability to interact with PI4Kβ and that expressed NCS-1-YFP co-localizes with PI4Kβ in the Golgi and induces the appearance of multiple perinuclear vacuoles. Analysis of the synthesis of endogenous PI(4)P in permeabilized COS-7 cells indicate that although overexpression of PI4Kβ and NCS-1 has detectable effects on PI(4)P synthesis during Ca2+-activated PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis, these effects are relatively minor compared with the amounts of the expressed proteins. These data suggest that PI4Kβ interacts with NCS-1, but this complex probably requires additional factor(s) to access the endogenous substrate PI and, hence, regulate PI(4)P synthesis in a specific cellular compartment.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we provide evidence for the association and possible regulation of PI4Kβ activity by the Ca2+-binding regulatory protein, NCS-1, in mammalian cells. This regulation has been shown previously in Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on both genetic and biochemical evidence (15Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Our data using recombinant proteins indicate that PI4Kβ and NCS-1 can interact without any additional binding partner, although it cannot be ruled out that, in the intact cell, additional proteins or lipids may participate and modify the interaction between these two proteins. Our studies indicate that myristoylation of NCS-1 is critical for efficient interaction and stimulation of PI4Kβ, although in the yeast study a similar difference was not observed (15Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, in the same yeast study the myristoylation-defective mutant of yeast frequenin was found much less effective than wild type in suppressing a temperature-sensitivepik1 allele (15Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In the yeast, the N-terminal lipid kinase unique domain was found to be the site of NCS-1 binding to PIK1. The activity of GST-fused PI4Kβ was not affected by NCS-1 in our studies, also indicating the involvement of N-terminal sequences on PI4Kβ in the association. Although we found that Ca2+ can further stimulate the activity of the NCS-1-PI4Kβ complex, Ca2+was not essential for the association of the two proteins, and the presence or absence of Ca2+ did not make a noticeable difference in our immunoprecipitation experiments. Similarly, Ca2+ was found not to be required for the association of the two proteins in yeast (15Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).Overexpression of PI4Kβ with or without NCS-1 had little if any impact on the [32P]phosphate labeling of endogenous PI(4)P in permeabilized COS-7 cells under basal condition. However, the two proteins still exerted a small but significant effect on [32P]phosphate labeling of PI(4)P during Ca2+-induced phospholipase C activation, confirming the functional interaction between the two proteins. These results are consistent with our observation that recombinant PI4Kβ is not able to phosphorylate the endogenous PI of red blood cell membranes, 3T. Balla, unpublished results. indicating that a putative adapter molecule assists the kinase in its access to the membrane-bound substrate. These data, as well as those on the cellular localization of the two proteins (see below), also suggest that NCS-1 alone is not the adapter that determines the localization of the kinase and that NCS-1 stimulates the kinase only in a membrane subdomain, most likely related to the Golgi.Our studies on the localization of the two proteins expressed in COS-7 cells are consistent with the biochemical data showing interaction of the two proteins. Both proteins are localized to the Golgi, as are their endogenous forms as shown in a recent study (29Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, NCS-1-YFP is also found in certain membranes (plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, and vacuolar membranes) where the localization of PI4Kβ is less prominent or completely lacking. We found no indication that NCS-1 would change its localization in response to the Ca2+ionophore, ionomycin. This is in agreement with recent findings on the Ca2+ insensitivity of myristoylated NCS-1 binding to rat brain membranes (30McFerran B.W. Weiss J.L. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 30258-30265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The most prominent effect of the overexpression of NCS-1-YFP was the formation of large perinuclear vacuoles with NCS-1 present in their membranes in the majority of the cells expressing this protein. Although these structures did not show particular enrichment in PI4Kβ, the co-expression of a catalytically inactive mutant PI4Kβ, or its catalytically inactive GFP fusion form, was able to prevent the development of this characteristic vacuolar phenotype. These data strongly argue that PI4Kβ mediates the effects of NCS-1, leading to the development of the morphological changes. Intriguingly, in a recent report Weisz et al. (21Weisz O.A. Gibson G.A. Leung S.M. Roder J. Jeromin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24341-24347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have shown that overexpression of NCS-1 caused a defect in the apical transport of influenza hemagglutinin from the trans-Golgi network, without affecting early transport steps from the Golgi in MDCK cells. All these data together are consistent with an important role of Arf-1, NCS-1, and PI4Kβ in the Golgi (12Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Marra P. Di Tullio G. Iurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and subsequent vesicular trafficking steps, similarly to the role of PIK1 in yeast (9Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).The tissue distribution and reported effects of NCS-1 together suggest that the physiological function(s) of this protein is to regulate neuroendocrine secretion and transmitter release (31McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). While overexpression of NCS-1 significantly enhanced purinergic stimulation of secretion in adrenal chromaffin cells, it failed to affect Ca2+-induced secretion in the same permeabilized cell preparation (30McFerran B.W. Weiss J.L. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 30258-30265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that despite being a Ca2+-binding protein, NCS-1 may not serve at the Ca2+-dependent final step of exocytosis. A connection between the function(s) of NCS-1 and PI4Kβ in the secretory process and/or presynaptic events is quite feasible in light of several studies, indicating the importance of inositides in the exocytic fusion event (32Martin T.F.J. Loyet K.M. Barry V.A. Kowalchik J.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 1137-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) as well as in the process of neurotransmitter release (14Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A. McCormick D.A. De Camilli P. Cell. 1999; 99: 179-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositides, and the kinases and phosphatases that regulate their levels, are clearly emerging as critical players at many cellular processes involving membrane budding or fusion events. Therefore, while NCS-1 and PI4Kβ might act in concert in regulating Golgi-related vesicular transport steps in COS-7 cells, the association between the two proteins could affect additional membrane events in neurons or secretory cells. While the present study demonstrates that the two proteins can physically associate with functional consequences on PI4Kβ activity, it still remains to be determined in which membrane compartment they function together to control exocytosis and neurotransmitter release. Inositol lipid kinases are increasingly recognized as regulators of membrane remodeling events whether in Golgi-related transport, endocytosis, or exocytosis (1Martin T.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).

Chem. 2000; 275: 24341-24347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have shown that overexpression of NCS-1 caused a defect in the apical transport of influenza hemagglutinin from the trans-Golgi network, without affecting early transport steps from the Golgi in MDCK cells. All these data together are consistent with an important role of Arf-1, NCS-1, and PI4Kβ in the Golgi (12Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Marra P. Di Tullio G. Iurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and subsequent vesicular trafficking steps, similarly to the role of PIK1 in yeast (9Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).The tissue distribution and reported effects of NCS-1 together suggest that the physiological function(s) of this protein is to regulate neuroendocrine secretion and transmitter release (31McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). While overexpression of NCS-1 significantly enhanced purinergic stimulation of secretion in adrenal chromaffin cells, it failed to affect Ca2+-induced secretion in the same permeabilized cell preparation (30McFerran B.W. Weiss J.L. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 30258-30265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that despite being a Ca2+-binding protein, NCS-1 may not serve at the Ca2+-dependent final step of exocytosis. A connection between the function(s) of NCS-1 and PI4Kβ in the secretory process and/or presynaptic events is quite feasible in light of several studies, indicating the importance of inositides in the exocytic fusion event (32Martin T.F.J. Loyet K.M. Barry V.A. Kowalchik J.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 1137-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) as well as in the process of neurotransmitter release (14Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A. McCormick D.A. De Camilli P. Cell. 1999; 99: 179-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositides, and the kinases and phosphatases that regulate their levels, are clearly emerging as critical players at many cellular processes involving membrane budding or fusion events. Therefore, while NCS-1 and PI4Kβ might act in concert in regulating Golgi-related vesicular transport steps in COS-7 cells, the association between the two proteins could affect additional membrane events in neurons or secretory cells. While the present study demonstrates that the two proteins can physically associate with functional consequences on PI4Kβ activity, it still remains to be determined in which membrane compartment they function together to control exocytosis and neurotransmitter release. In the present study we provide evidence for the association and possible regulation of PI4Kβ activity by the Ca2+-binding regulatory protein, NCS-1, in mammalian cells. This regulation has been shown previously in Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on both genetic and biochemical evidence (15Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Our data using recombinant proteins indicate that PI4Kβ and NCS-1 can interact without any additional binding partner, although it cannot be ruled out that, in the intact cell, additional proteins or lipids may participate and modify the interaction between these two proteins. Our studies indicate that myristoylation of NCS-1 is critical for efficient interaction and stimulation of PI4Kβ, although in the yeast study a similar difference was not observed (15Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, in the same yeast study the myristoylation-defective mutant of yeast frequenin was found much less effective than wild type in suppressing a temperature-sensitivepik1 allele (15Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In the yeast, the N-terminal lipid kinase unique domain was found to be the site of NCS-1 binding to PIK1. The activity of GST-fused PI4Kβ was not affected by NCS-1 in our studies, also indicating the involvement of N-terminal sequences on PI4Kβ in the association. Although we found that Ca2+ can further stimulate the activity of the NCS-1-PI4Kβ complex, Ca2+was not essential for the association of the two proteins, and the presence or absence of Ca2+ did not make a noticeable difference in our immunoprecipitation experiments. Similarly, Ca2+ was found not to be required for the association of the two proteins in yeast (15Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PI4Kβ with or without NCS-1 had little if any impact on the [32P]phosphate labeling of endogenous PI(4)P in permeabilized COS-7 cells under basal condition. However, the two proteins still exerted a small but significant effect on [32P]phosphate labeling of PI(4)P during Ca2+-induced phospholipase C activation, confirming the functional interaction between the two proteins. These results are consistent with our observation that recombinant PI4Kβ is not able to phosphorylate the endogenous PI of red blood cell membranes, 3T. Balla, unpublished results. indicating that a putative adapter molecule assists the kinase in its access to the membrane-bound substrate. These data, as well as those on the cellular localization of the two proteins (see below), also suggest that NCS-1 alone is not the adapter that determines the localization of the kinase and that NCS-1 stimulates the kinase only in a membrane subdomain, most likely related to the Golgi. Our studies on the localization of the two proteins expressed in COS-7 cells are consistent with the biochemical data showing interaction of the two proteins. Both proteins are localized to the Golgi, as are their endogenous forms as shown in a recent study (29Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, NCS-1-YFP is also found in certain membranes (plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, and vacuolar membranes) where the localization of PI4Kβ is less prominent or completely lacking. We found no indication that NCS-1 would change its localization in response to the Ca2+ionophore, ionomycin. This is in agreement with recent findings on the Ca2+ insensitivity of myristoylated NCS-1 binding to rat brain membranes (30McFerran B.W. Weiss J.L. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 30258-30265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The most prominent effect of the overexpression of NCS-1-YFP was the formation of large perinuclear vacuoles with NCS-1 present in their membranes in the majority of the cells expressing this protein. Although these structures did not show particular enrichment in PI4Kβ, the co-expression of a catalytically inactive mutant PI4Kβ, or its catalytically inactive GFP fusion form, was able to prevent the development of this characteristic vacuolar phenotype. These data strongly argue that PI4Kβ mediates the effects of NCS-1, leading to the development of the morphological changes. Intriguingly, in a recent report Weisz et al. (21Weisz O.A. Gibson G.A.

Therefore, we renatured the enzyme after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and assayed slices of the gel for DNA N-glycosylase activity directed against 5hmUra. Maximum enzymatic activity was identified between molecular mass markers 30 and 34 kDa. Protein was extracted from gel slices and subjected to tryptic digestion and analysis by mass spectrometry. Analysis revealed the presence of 11 peptides that were homologous or identical to the sequence of the recently characterized human single-stranded monofunctional uracil DNA N-glycosylase (hSMUG1). The cDNA of hSMUG1 was isolated and expressed as a recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein that was shown to release 5hmUra with 20× the specific activity of the most purified bovine fraction.

Its formation has been posited to be caused by the indirect action of ionizing radiation under aerobic conditions via the hydroxyl radical-mediated abstraction of a hydrogen radical from the 5-methyl-moiety of thymine followed by oxidation via molecular oxygen (1Cerutti P.A. Wang S.Y. Photochemistry and Photobiology of Nucleic Acids. Academic Press, New York1976: 375-401Crossref Google Scholar). 5hmUra has also been identified in human urine and in the DNA of white cells, and the amount has been found to vary under differing conditions of oxidative stress (2Faure H. Mousseau M. Cadet J. Guimier C. Tripier M. Hida H. Favier A. Free Radic. Res. 1998; 28: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 3Pourcelot S. Faure H. Firoozi F. Ducros V. Tripier M.

Human autoantibodies directed against 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyuridine in DNA have been identified, and the titer has been correlated with relative risk for certain types of cancer (5Frenkel K. Karkoszka J. Glassman T. Dubin N. Toniolo P. Taioli E. Mooney L.A. Kato I. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev. 1998; 7: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). Despite identification as a radiation product nearly 20 years ago, the biological consequences of the formation of 5hmUra from thymine in DNA remain uncertain. 5hmUra is a normal constituent of SPO1 Bacillus subtilis phage DNA (6Kallen R.G. Simon M. Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1962; 5: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), functioning as a coding partner for adenine in place of thymine, and is present in large amounts in the DNA of dinoflagellates (7Herzog M. Soyer M.O. Daney de Marcillac G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 27: 151-155Google Scholar). Nonetheless, 5hmUra is a substrate for a DNA N-glycosylase activity, 5hmUra DNA N-glycosylase (HMUDG), which releases 5hmUra from the DNA backbone (8Hollstein M.C. Brooks P. Linn S. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4003-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 9Boorstein R.J. Levy D.D. Teebor G.W. Mutat. Res. 1987; 183: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Compared with most other DNA N-glycosylases, HMUDG activity is unusual in that no comparable activity has been detected in bacteria (10Friedberg E.C. Ganesan A.K. Minton K. J. Virol. 1975; 16: 315-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or yeast (9Boorstein R.J. Levy D.D. Teebor G.W. Mutat. Res. 1987; 183: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We undertook a study of the phylogenetic distribution of HMUDG activity (11Boorstein R.J. Chiu L.-N. Teebor G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7653-7661Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and our results indicate that the phylogenetic distribution of HMUDG was linked to the use by the organism of 5-methylcytosine (5meCyt) as a mediator of gene expression. We suggested that 5hmUra could be formed in DNA via two pathways. One pathway was the oxidation of the 5-methyl group of thymine yielding 5hmUra directly. Alternatively, 5hmUra may arise via oxidation of the 5-methyl group of 5meCyt yielding 5hmCyt followed by deamination of 5hmCyt to 5hmUra (12Cannon-Carlson S.V. Gokhale H. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13306-13312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The propensity of 5hmCyt residues to deaminate to 5hmUra has long ago been observed in the DNA of the Escherichia coli T-even phages. These phages utilize glucosylated 5hmCyt as a normal constituent of DNA and exhibit a very high rate of C to T transitions upon heating (13Baltz R.H. Bingham P.M. Drake J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, in cellular DNA the oxidation and subsequent deamination of 5meCyt, if left unrepaired, may result in a C to T transition in CpG islands. We previously reported the partial purification of HMUDG from calf thymus and demonstrated that HMUDG activity was distinct from the major uracil DNA N-glycosylase (UDG) activity of the cell (12Cannon-Carlson S.V. Gokhale H. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13306-13312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have been unable to achieve a degree of purification sufficient to identify the HMUDG protein species with certainty from examination of an SDS-PAGE analysis of our most purified calf thymus fraction. In this report we describe the methods by which we were able to unequivocally demonstrate that HMUDG is the recently characterized single-stranded monofunctional uracil DNA N-glycosylase (SMUG1) (14Haushalter K.A. Todd Stukenberg M.W. Kirschner M.W. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 174-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Fresh calf thymus obtained from local abattoirs, generally weighing between 1.2 and 2 kg, was trimmed of connective tissue. 600-g portions were homogenized in a Waring Blendor together with 3 volumes of Buffer A (25 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 7.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 100 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) per 1.0 liter of buffer). The total volume of homogenate from a typical preparation was between 5 and 7 liters. To this homogenate 5 m NaCl was added to a final concentration of 320 mm NaCl. The resulting gelatinous precipitate of nucleoprotein was removed by spooling onto a 10-ml glass pipette. The remaining liquid was filtered through cheesecloth followed by clearing via centrifugation in the GS-3 rotor of a Sorvall RC-5B centrifuge at 9000 rpm for 20 min to yield Fraction I (15Hilbert T.P. Boorstein R.J. Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2505-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Fraction I was precipitated with solid (NH4)2SO4 to a final concentration of 70%, the pH continually being adjusted with NH4OH to maintain pH 7.5. After centrifugation, the pellets were washed with 100% (NH4)2SO4 and stored at 4 °C in aliquots representing the pelleted material from 500 ml of the original 70% (NH4)2SO4suspension, yielding Fraction II. Fraction II was dialyzed overnight against Buffer A and applied to a 100-ml bed cation exchange resin in an XK 26/20 column (SP Fastflow,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Aliquots of Fraction II applied to the column averaged 3–4 g of protein/sample, which was half the maximal binding capacity of the resin. The column was washed with Buffer A until absorbance of the eluent at 280 nm was at a minimum. Protein was eluted with a 1-liter gradient of Buffer A increasing in NaCl concentration from 0 to 1 m at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Fractions were collected as 10-ml aliquots and were assayed for HMUDG activity as described below. Fractions containing HMUDG activity were pooled as Fraction III. Fraction III was adjusted to 70% (NH4)2SO4 by the addition of solid (NH4)2SO4 and then pelleted by centrifugation to make Fraction IV, which was stored in aliquots at 4 °C. Aliquots of Fraction IV, dissolved in Buffer A in 400 mmNaCl, were applied to a Hiload chromatography Superdex-75 preparative column that had been calibrated with the gel filtration low molecular weight calibration kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min using 400 mm NaCl Buffer A, and fractions were collected as 5-ml aliquots. Fifty microliters of each aliquot were assayed for HMUDG activity, and aliquots containing HMUDG activity were pooled as Fraction V. Fraction V was pooled and concentrated using a Mono-S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, HR10/10) equilibrated with Buffer A in 20 mm NaCl. The protein was eluted with a 20 mm to 1 m NaCl 100-ml gradient of Buffer A and collected as 1-ml aliquots. Aliquots containing HMUDG activity were pooled as Fraction VI. Fraction VI, which was ∼200 mm with respect to NaCl as determined by measurement of conductance, was diluted 10-fold to 20 mm NaCl with Buffer A and then applied to an 80-ml heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein was eluted with a 20 mm to 1 m NaCl 800-ml gradient of Buffer A at a flow rate of 2 ml/min and collected as 8-ml aliquots. Aliquots containing HMUDG activity were pooled as Fraction VII. Fraction VII was pooled and dialyzed in 20 mm NaCl Buffer A and applied to a 5-ml single-stranded DNA cellulose column (Sigma). The column was pre-equilibrated with dialysis buffer. Protein was eluted with a 20 mm to 1 m NaCl 50-ml gradient of Buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 1-ml aliquots were collected. Aliquots containing HMUDG activity were pooled as Fraction VIII. [3H]SPO1 phage DNA, prepared as described previously, was used as substrate (12Cannon-Carlson S.V. Gokhale H. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13306-13312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3 mCi of [5,6-3H]uridine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were added to a phage-infected 100-ml log phase bacterial culture. This yielded between 30 and 50 μg of phage DNA of a specific radioactivity of between 105 and 2 × 105 cpm/μg as measured by A260 (1 OD unit is 50 μg of double-stranded DNA). Enzymatic digestion of SPO1 DNA to 2′-deoxyribonucleosides followed by HPLC analysis attached to an on-line liquid scintillation counter revealed 65–70% of the radioactivity to be in Cyt moieties and 30–35% to be in 5hmUra moieties. Non-radioactive Cyt and 5hmUra (Sigma) were used as UV-absorbing migration standards (12Cannon-Carlson S.V. Gokhale H. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13306-13312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Frenkel K. Cummings A. Solomon J. Cadet J. Steinberg J.J. Teebor G.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4527-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Assays of HMUDG activity were performed in 200-μl volumes in Buffer A (12Cannon-Carlson S.V. Gokhale H. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13306-13312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated after 30 or 60 min, and the macromolecules were precipitated with 100 μl of BSA (50 mg/ml) and 5 ml of ice-cold acetone. After standing for 15 min at 4 °C the tubes were centrifuged in a Beckmann 6KR centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant acetone decanted. The acetone was evaporated under the hood, and the dried residue was redissolved in 500 μl of H2O. The radioactive content of the aqueous solution containing the redissolved residue was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. The specificity of the HMUDG reaction was confirmed by HPLC analysis coupled with an on-line liquid scintillation counter, of an aliquot of the aqueous supernatant using non-radioactive 5hmUra as a UV-absorbing migration standard (12Cannon-Carlson S.V. Gokhale H. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13306-13312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed according to the procedures of Hilbert et al. (15Hilbert T.P. Boorstein R.J. Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2505-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The protein sample to be analyzed was boiled for 10 min and then loaded and run on a 13% gel (5% stacking gel) with low range molecular size markers (Bio-Rad) at 80 mA. Samples were applied to duplicate lanes to allow one lane to be used for mass spectrometric analysis. After electrophoresis the gel was divided, and the portion to be used for molecular weight alignment was stained with Coomassie Blue. The unstained portion was kept in buffer. The marker gel was then destained and soaked in double-distilled H2O to allow it to expand to its original size. The stained and unstained gels were aligned on a sheet of parafilm. The unstained gel was cut into 0.4-cm slices. One-third of each slice was reserved for mass spectrometry, and the remainder of each slice was placed into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes with 400 μl of elution buffer (25 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml acetylated BSA). The following renaturation procedure was adopted from that of Neddermann et al. (21Neddermann P. Gallinari P. Lettieri T. Schmid D. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12767-12774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The slices were homogenized (using a microsample Teflon pestle (Scienceware) attached to a hand drill) until no large pieces of gel remained. The suspension was then vigorously shaken overnight at 37 °C. The gel suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C in the GS-3 rotor of a Sorvall RC-5B centrifuge. The supernatant was transferred to a 2-ml Eppendorf tube, and 1.6 ml of ice-cold acetone (4 volumes) were added. The samples were maintained in an ethanol/dry ice bath for 30 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed with 600 μl of 80% acetone, 20% dilution buffer (100 mm HEPES pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml BSA). The pellet was drained and dried at room temperature for 10 min followed by resuspension in 37.5 μl of guanidine buffer (dilution buffer plus 6 m guanidine HCl). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, 1.875 ml of dilution buffer was added, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight to permit renaturation. The samples were concentrated in Centricon-10 microconcentrators that had been washed with 0.5 ml of dilution buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml BSA by centrifugation at 4 °C at 6000 rpm for 45 min. The samples were then loaded onto the microconcentrators and centrifuged at 4 °C at 6,000 rpm for 1 h. The resulting retentate (generally 75–125 μl) was assayed for HMUDG activity. Six gel slices containing proteins of apparent molecular mass between 23 and 35 kDa were excised from an unstained SDS-PAGE gel under a tissue culture hood to minimize contamination. Two-thirds of each gel slice was assayed for HMUDG activity as described above. The remaining third was fixed in 50% methanol, 5% acetic acid in water for 20 min and then washed with 50% methanol and water to remove the remaining SDS and acetic acid. The gel slices were cut into 1 mm3 pieces, reduced, alkylated using iodoacetamide, and digested in-gel with trypsin (17Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). The peptides were extracted, dried under vacuum, and redissolved in 20 μl of 5% acetic acid. Samples were desalted and concentrated using Zip-TipTM C18 micro-columns (Millipore). Peptides were eluted with 2 μl of 70% acetonitrile. The final solution was adjusted to contain 50% acetonitrile, 1% acetic acid and then loaded into a gold-coated medium nanoelectrospray needle (Protana). MS and MS/MS spectra were acquired on a quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer equipped with a Z-spray nano-ESI ion source (Micromass, Manchester, UK). The instrument was calibrated in MS/MS mode using 1 pmol/μl [Glu1]-Fibrinopeptide B (Sigma) in 50% methanol/1% acetic acid. The capillary voltage used was 1400 V, and the cone voltage was set to 40 V. Tryptic peptide precursor ions (singly, doubly, or triply charged) were selected by the quadrupole mass filter (MS1) and induced to fragment by collision with Argon, and the resulting product ions were analyzed by the time-of-flight mass analyzer (MS2). The collision energy was varied between 15 and 45 V depending on the mass and charge-state of the peptides. The recorded MS/MS spectra were processed using MassLynx MaxEnt 3 (Micromass). The charged state deconvoluted MS/MS spectra were directly used to search the public data base using the Mascot search program (Matrix Science, UK). For peptides with no exact matches in the public data bases, the MS/MS spectra were sequenced de novo either manually or with the aid of the PepSeq program (Micromass). The amino acid sequences obtained in this way were searched against the NCBI nonredundant protein data base using the BLAST search program (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). The hSMUG1 coding sequence was polymerase chain reaction-amplified as a BamHI-XhoI fragment from a hSMUG1 cDNA clone (ATCC 294606) purchased from ATCC. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) so as to express the protein as an N-terminal GST fusion protein for purification on a glutathione column. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced in E. coli BL21-DE3 cells by the addition of isopropyl-β-d thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. A 1-liter bacterial culture at an A600 of 0.6 was induced at 30 °C for 5 h and harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C at 3200 ×g in a Beckman 6KR centrifuge. The recombinant protein was purified from the induced cell pellet using glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity medium (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per the manufacturer’s protocols for batch purification of fusion proteins. Following purification, the glutathione S-transferase moiety was removed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using Prescission Protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), leaving five amino acid residues remaining on the N terminus of the recombinant hSMUG1 (20Marenstein D.R. Ocampo M.T. Chan M.K. Altamirano A. Basu A.K. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J. Biol.

All 2′-deoxyribose oligonucleotides were deblocked, deprotected, and purified by 20% denaturing PAGE. A 26-mer uracil-containing 2′-deoxyribose oligonucleotide of the sequence d(CGCGAAACGCCTAGUGATTGGTAGGG) was labeled at the 5′-end using [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.). For assays involving DNA duplexes, the 5′-end-labeled 26-mer uracil-containing 2′-deoxyribose oligonucleotide was annealed to the corresponding complementary strand (containing either an A or G at position 12) in a 1:2 molar ratio. Assays were performed at 37 °C in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Enzyme, protein, and substrate were diluted to working conditions in assay buffer and equilibrated at 37 °C. Assays contained 2 μm32P-5′-end-labeled single-stranded or duplex 26-mer uracil-containing 2′-deoxyribose oligonucleotide and 20 nm hSMUG1 with or without 0.3 units of uracil DNA N-glycosylase inhibitor (New England Biolabs). The concentration of hSMUG1 was determined using the Bradford assay with albumin as standard and was assigned a molecular weight of 30,142.0 to the fusion protein. The control assays for effectiveness of the uracil DNA N-glycosylase inhibitor contained 0.3 units of uracil DNA N-glycosylase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The enzyme solutions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 min prior to the addition of substrate. The final volume was 10 μl. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and were terminated by snap-freezing in ethanol and dry ice and treated with 5 μl of 0.5 m putrescine, pH 8.0 (19Zharkov D.O. Rosenquist T.A. Gerchman S.E. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28607-28617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The treated reaction mixtures were then heated at 95 °C for 5 min followed by the addition of 15 μl of loading dye (95% deionized formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol). Samples were then heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and products were separated by 20% PAGE in 7 m urea and Tris borate/EDTA (TBE). Products were analyzed via phosphorimaging using a Molecular Imager FX System with Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad) (20Marenstein D.R. Ocampo M.T. Chan M.K. Altamirano A. Basu A.K. Boorstein R.J.

A mammalian protein with HMUDG activity was purified from fresh calf thymus on the basis of the ability to excise [3H]5hmUra from [3H]SPO1 DNA, as shown in TableI. Calf thymus was used as the source of enzyme because large amounts of fresh tissue are available, and our previous studies revealed that the specific HMUDG activity of thymus was higher than any other tissue except brain (12Cannon-Carlson S.V. Gokhale H. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13306-13312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purification scheme was similar to that used previously to purify human endonuclease III homologue 1 (15Hilbert T.P. Boorstein R.J. Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2505-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), with the addition of an (NH4)2SO4 concentration step. After the final purification step, the enzyme had been purified ∼500-fold, with a yield of 0.2%. This estimate of degree of purity was based on the specific activity of the HMUDG in the crude preparation after the addition of 5 m NaCl and spooling out of the gelatinous nucleoprotein precipitate resulting from the addition of NaCl. This step actually increased the specific activity of HMUDG by 3–5-fold from that of the crude homogenate, so the final degree of purification (as measured by an increase in specific enzyme activity) was somewhere between 1500- and 2500-fold.Table ISummary of purification of a 5-hydroxymethyluracil DNA N-glycosylase activity from calf thymusFractionaPurification steps and fractions are described in the text.VolumeTotal proteinSpecific activityPurificationYieldTotal unitsmlmgpmol/min/mgfold%× 106I450091,8000.8468II550079,2002.02.314.8704III250017,0007.38.87.050IV3502450NDbND, not determined.NDNDNDV23057528.2347.554VI14021031377.453VII1088.61611947.047VIII33.44004820.21.5a Purification steps and fractions are described in the text.b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The most purified fraction (Fraction VIII) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A). The HMUDG protein could not be definitively associated with a single Coomassie Blue-stained band on the gel. To identify the region of the gel that contained HMUDG, an identical gel lane was cut into fractions (as indicated in Fig. 1 A) and the proteins renatured. The renatured proteins were assayed for HMUDG activity. The greatest amount of HMUDG activity was present in slice 2 (Fig. 1 B). The activity of renatured protein corresponded to a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 34 kDa, reasonably consistent with the molecular radius of 29–30 kDa we observed for the native bovine protein on the Superdex-75 column (Fraction V). The nano-ESI mass spectrum (m/z range of 300–1600) of peptides from slice 2 that showed the highest HMUDG activity is shown in Fig. 2 A. In this complex spectrum, more than 150 singly, doubly, or triply charged tryptic peptides were observed, indicating that a mixture of proteins was present in this gel slice. In the MS survey, we found that the signals of a number of peptides observed in Fig. 2 A were significantly weaker or absent in the nano-ESI spectra of other gel slices (data not shown), indicating that these peptides correlated with HMUDG activity. Therefore, these peptides were further fragmented by collision-induced dissociation to generate sequences or sequence tags. The recorded MS/MS spectra were used for a data base search (see “Experimental Procedures”). To illustrate this identification process, the MS/MS spectrum of the doubly charged peptides at m/z696.36 is shown in Fig. 2 B. The complete y ion series (y1–y14) could be assigned, allowing the determination of the full peptide sequence as SLAEGFLQELR (low collision energy MS/MS analysis as used here cannot distinguish between the isobaric Ile and Leu amino acid residues). Direct data base searching with the uninterpreted MS/MS spectrum did not result in a positive protein identification. However, searching the NCBI protein data base using BLAST revealed that the bovine sequence nearly matched a peptide sequence from human SMUG1, a recently identified member of a family of uracil DNA N-glycosylases. Two changed amino acids were Ser→Gly(G) and Glu→Gln(Q). The probability that this identification was correct was high because a total of 13 peptide ions in Fig. 1 A, corresponding to 11 peptide sequences obtained by MS/MS (Table II), were found to match or nearly match sequences from hSMUG1. The alignment of these bovine sequences with the hSMUG1 sequence is shown in Fig. 3.Table IIPeptide sequences obtained by MS/MS and matched to SMUG1Peptide sequenceaC represents carboxyamidomethylcysteine.

Open table in a new tab The human SMUG1 cDNA was isolated and expressed as a GST fusion protein, which was purified and the GST moiety removed, leaving 5 amino acids on the N terminus of the recombinant hSMUG1. When analyzed by PAGE, the purified recombinant protein was visualized as a single band (Fig. 4) with an apparent molecular mass slightly larger than that of the region of the gel where the maximal activity of purified bovine HMUDG was recovered (Fig. 3). Purified expressed hSMUG1 was assayed for its ability to release [3H]5hmUra from [3H]SP01. At the concentrations assayed, there was a linear increase of release of 5hmUra with the increase in hSMUG1 concentration (Fig. 5). The identity of the released material was confirmed by HPLC. The specific activity of purified recombinant hSMUG1 was ∼20× greater than the most purified fraction (Fraction VIII) of bovine HMUDG. Recombinant hSMUG1 was analyzed for its ability to remove Ura from single- and double-stranded 2′-deoxyribose oligonucleotides containing a single Ura residue (Fig. 6). The recombinant protein showed maximal activity in a cleavage assay against single-stranded DNA. hSMUG1 also displayed activity against double-stranded DNA containing a single Ura residue. As reported by Haushalter et al. (14Haushalter K.A. Todd Stukenberg M.W. Kirschner M.W. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 174-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), hSMUG1 activity was greater against mismatches (U:G) than against matches (U:A). The activity of the recombinant hSMUG1 was distinct from UDG (in this case recombinant bacterial UDG). UDG had greater activity against double-stranded DNA containing U opposite A (Fig. 6, lane 7). Furthermore, UDG activity was suppressed by UGI in contrast to hSMUG1 activity, which was not (Fig. 6, lane 8). SMUG1 was identified by binding to synthetic uracil DNA N-glycosylase inhibitors and has been definitively shown to be distinct from the primary uracil DNA N-glycosylase UDG and a second protein, thymine DNA N-glycosylase (TDG) which preferentially repairs U:G and T:G mismatches (14Haushalter K.A. Todd Stukenberg M.W. Kirschner M.W. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 174-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In this study we have shown that a bovine protein with HMUDG activity, as defined previously by Hollstein et al. (8Hollstein M.C. Brooks P. Linn S. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4003-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and this group (9Boorstein R.J. Levy D.D. Teebor G.W. Mutat. Res. 1987; 183: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Cannon-Carlson S.V. Gokhale H. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13306-13312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has peptide sequences homologous to those of hSMUG1, whereas recombinant hSMUG1 is shown here for the first time to have HMUDG activity. Previous observations of HMUDG activity in cells and tissues can now be reevaluated in light of the determination of the identity of HMUDG as SMUG1. The HMUDG activity was first searched for in bacteria, where it could not be found (10Friedberg E.C. Ganesan A.K. Minton K. J. Virol. 1975; 16: 315-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it was subsequently shown to be absent in yeast but present in more complex multicellular organisms (11Boorstein R.J. Chiu L.-N. Teebor G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7653-7661Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This unique phylogenetic distribution has been confirmed for SMUG1 (14Haushalter K.A. Todd Stukenberg M.W. Kirschner M.W. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 174-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) in contrast to UDG, which is highly conserved throughout phylogeny. The uracil DNA N-glycosylase activity of SMUG1 is not inhibited by the phage UGI. Our most purified fractions of bovine HMUDG also displayed uracil DNA N-glycosylase activity that was not inhibited by UGI (data not shown), further confirming the identity of HMUDG as SMUG1. Additional support for the identity of HMUDG as SMUG1 comes from the finding that SMUG1 ESTs are present in a wide variety of tissues (14Haushalter K.A. Todd Stukenberg M.W. Kirschner M.W. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 174-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 22Nilsen H. Haushalter K.A. Robins P. Barnes D.B. Verdine G.L. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4278-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), consistent with our previous observation that HMUDG activity is present in all tissues, and is most abundant in brain and thymus (11Boorstein R.J. Chiu L.-N. Teebor G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7653-7661Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The biological role of HMUDG/SMUG1 is still uncertain. Haushalter and co-workers (14Haushalter K.A. Todd Stukenberg M.W. Kirschner M.W. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 174-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 22Nilsen H. Haushalter K.A. Robins P. Barnes D.B. Verdine G.L. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4278-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) speculated that SMUG1 might play a role in the repair of Ura residues resulting from deamination of Cyt residues in DNA that is transiently single-stranded during transcription, recombination, or replication. Recent work by the same group has suggested that SMUG1 functions as an antimutator, with preference for repair of Ura opposite guanine (22Nilsen H. Haushalter K.A. Robins P. Barnes D.B. Verdine G.L. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4278-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We previously proposed that HMUDG might repair 5hmUra residues arising from oxidation and deamination of 5meCyt residues in DNA that, if unrepaired, would be mutagenic. Such a hypothesis is supported by the common phylogenetic distributions of the use of 5meCyt as a regulatory element in transcription, HMUDG enzyme activity, and SMUG1 EST sequences. Recent evidence further supports this hypothesis. It was shown that 5hmUra, as part of 5hmUra:G mismatches, was repaired to a significantly greater extent than 5hmUra:A in identical sequences using partially purified HMUDG from Hela cells (23Rusmintratip V. Sowers L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14183-14187Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Regardless of which of the two putative functions is of greater significance to the maintenance of genomic integrity by HMUDG/SMUG1, it should be noted that a mutant Syrian hamster cell line (V79) deficient in HMUDG activity, which we developed, is viable and grows normally (24Boorstein R.J. Chiu L.N. Teebor G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5536-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although it seems evident that HMUDG/SMUG1 protects cells from mutations arising from conversion of 5meCyt to 5hmUra and deamination of Cyt to Ura, the possibility remains that HMUDG/SMUG1 is also involved in a sequence of controlled oxidation of 5meCyt followed by deamination and removal of 5hmUra as a mechanism of changing the methylation status of specific regions of DNA. Full understanding of the biological significance of HMUDG/SMUG1 will require an explanation of both its unique in vitro substrate specificities and its phylogenetic distribution. We thank Dr. Lawrence C. Sowers for valuable discussions and remarkable insight."
https://openalex.org/W2086394805,"The VHL gene product (pVHL) forms a multimeric complex with the elongin B and C, Cul2 and Rbx1 proteins (VCBCR complex), which is homologous to the SCF family of ubiquitin ligase complexes. The VCBCR complex binds HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha, transcription factors critically involved in cellular responses to hypoxia, and targets them for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Germline mutations in the VHL gene cause susceptibility to haemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), phaeochromocytoma and other tumours. In addition somatic inactivation of the VHL gene occurs in most sporadic clear cell RCC (CC-RCC). However, the absence of somatic VHL inactivation in 30-40% of CC-RCC implies the involvement of other gatekeeper genes in CC-RCC development. We reasoned that in CC-RCC without VHL inactivation, other pVHL-interacting proteins might be defective. To assess the role of elongin B/C, Rbx1 and HIF-1alpha in RCC tumorigenesis we (a) mapped the genes to chromosomes 8q(cen) (elongin C), 16p13.3 (elongin B) and 22q11.2 (Rbx1) by FISH, monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid panel screening and in silico GenBank homology searching; (b) determined the genomic organisation of elongin C (by direct sequencing of PAC clones), Rbx1 and elongin B (by GenBank homology searching); and (c) performed mutation analysis of exons comprising the coding regions of elongins B, C and Rbx1 and the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1alpha by SSCP screening and direct sequencing in 35 sporadic clear cell RCC samples without VHL gene inactivation and in 13 individuals with familial non-VHL clear cell RCC. No coding region sequence variations were detected for the elongin B, elongin C or Rbx1 genes. Two amino acid substitutions (Pro582Ser and Ala588Thr) were identified in the oxygen-dependent degradation/pVHL binding domain of HIF-1alpha, however neither substitution was observed exclusively in tumour samples. Association analysis in panels of CC-RCC and non-neoplastic samples using the RFLPs generated by each variant did not reveal allelic frequency differences between RCC patients and controls (P>0.32 by chi-squared analysis). Nevertheless, the significance of these variations and their potential for modulation of HIF-1alpha function merits further investigation in both other tumour types and in non-neoplastic disease. Taken together with our previous Cul2 mutation analysis these data suggest that development of sporadic and familial RCC is not commonly contributed to by genetic events altering the destruction domain of HIF-1alpha, or components of the HIF-alpha destruction complex other than VHL itself. Although (a) activation of HIF could occur through mutation of another region of HIF-a, and (b) epigenetic silencing of elongin B/C, Cul2 or Rbx1 cannot be excluded, these findings suggest that pVHL may represent the sole mutational target through which the VCBR complex is disrupted in CC-RCC. HIF response is activated in CC-RCC tumorigenesis."

Sci. 1999; 24: 17-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). According to their transport mechanism, they are described as Sec-dependent, ΔpH/TAT1 (twin arginine translocation)-dependent, SRP-dependent, and spontaneous pathway, respectively. Among these, the ΔpH/TAT pathway has received particular attention in the past few years because of its unique mechanism; it does not require soluble factors nor nucleoside triphosphates but depends solely on the transthylakoidal proton gradient (11Mould R.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12189-12193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1992; 18: 1031-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast to the other pathways, it is furthermore capable of translocating not only unfolded polypeptide chains but also folded protein domains across the membrane (14Creighton A.M. Hulford A. Mant A. Robinson D. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1663-1669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Clark S.A. Theg S.M. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34868-34874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In bacteria, a phylogenetically related protein transport pathway exists that shows a strikingly similar substrate specificity (17Mori H. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11405-11408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Wexler M. Bogsch E.G. Klösgen R.B. Palmer T. Robinson C. Berks B.C.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This pathway is responsible for the export of a group of periplasmic proteins carrying complex redox cofactors (20Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 21Weiner J.H. Bilous P.T. Shaw G.M. Lubitz S.P. Frost L. Thomas G.H. Cole J.A. Turner R.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Assembly of these cofactors takes place in the cytoplasm, i.e. the proteins must fold at least partially prior to membrane translocation (22Santini C-L. Ize B. Chanal A. Müller M. Giordano G. Wu L.-F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 23Blaudeck N. Sprenger G.A. Freudl R. Wiegert T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Since the thylakoidal Rieske protein also carries a redox cofactor in its native conformation, it is appealing to speculate that it likewise might be targeted in a folded conformation by the ΔpH/TAT-dependent pathway across the thylakoid membrane. However, the thylakoid transport signal of the Rieske protein does not resemble ΔpH/TAT-specific targeting signals. It is not a cleavable signal peptide but operates as a signal anchor domain (8Madueno F. Bradshaw S.A. Gray J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17458-17463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and furthermore, it lacks the indicative twin-R motif (24Chaddock A.M. Mant A. Karnauchov I. Brink S. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), which even accounts for the denomination of the entire pathway. Here we show that the Rieske protein of higher plant chloroplasts is transported with a mechanism that is unique among all thylakoid proteins characterized so far. Although specifically translocated by the ΔpH/TAT-dependent pathway across the thylakoid membrane, the targeting process is characterized by a number of unusual features including the involvement of components from the Sec-dependent protein transport route. This suggests that the Rieske protein might represent an ancient or intermediate state in the evolution of transport pathways at the thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts. Spinach (Spinacia oleracea var. Lina) was grown in hydroponic culture under constant temperature (18–22 °C) and light regime (8/16-h light/dark cycles) and harvested 2–3 months after sowing. Pea seedlings (Pisum sativum var. Feltham First) were grown for 8–10 days under a 16-h photoperiod. Precursor proteins were synthesized by in vitro transcription of the corresponding cDNA clones and subsequent in vitrotranslation in cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]methionine. Intact chloroplasts were isolated from pea or spinach leaves by Percoll gradient centrifugation essentially as described (25Bartlett S.G Grossman A.R. Chua N.-H. Edelmann M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.-H.

Competition experiments were performed with precursor proteins that were obtained by overexpression in Escherichia coli (28Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B.

The solubilized proteins were included in the import assays at concentrations up to 4 μm, taking care that the concentration of urea in the assays never exceeded 300 mm. Control assays contained the same amount of buffer lacking any such solubilized protein.

Stromal protein complexes were separated under nondenaturing conditions (34Reuter W. Nickel C. Wehrmeyer W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using a running buffer of 45 mm Tris and 45 mm boric acid. All other methods followed the protocols of Sambrook et al. (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A striking feature in the targeting process of the Rieske protein is the remarkably slow sorting of the protein within the chloroplast to its final destination, the thylakoid membrane system. In experiments with intact chloroplasts isolated from spinach, only about 30% of the Rieske protein that is imported into the organelle reaches the thylakoids during the incubation period of 20 min (Fig. 1). The majority of the protein accumulates in the stroma where it is processed to the mature polypeptide of ∼20 kDa. This behavior is even more pronounced if pea chloroplasts are used in the experiment. In this instance, usually more than 90% of the imported Rieske protein remains in the stroma during the incubation process (Fig. 1). Such retardation in the intraorganellar sorting and targeting process is unique among all thylakoid proteins analyzed so far. Usually, these proteins arrive at their target membrane almost quantitatively under these conditions (e.g. Ref. 27Clausmeyer S. Klösgen R.B. Herrmann R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the Rieske protein has reached the thylakoids, it is to a large extent protected against the activity of proteases that are added externally to reisolated thylakoid vesicles, which indicates that the COOH-terminal hydrophilic domain has been completely translocated into the lumenal space (Fig. 1). This fraction of the Rieske protein is furthermore correctly assembled into the cytochromeb 6 /f complex after import, as demonstrated by its co-migration with the native cytochrome complex during blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.2). Thus, whereas the protein is only slowly targeted to the thylakoid system after import into the organelle, its subsequent assembly into the cytochromeb 6 /f complex apparently is an efficient process. Similar to a few other proteins,e.g. PSI-F (36Karnauchov I. Cai D. Schmidt I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32871-32878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Mant A. Nielsen S.V. Knott T.G. Møller B.L. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27303-27309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Rieske protein depends on intact chloroplasts for its thylakoid transport and is not able to translocate into isolated thylakoid vesicles obtained after osmotic lysis of the organelles (data not shown). However, it is possible in experiments with intact organelles to demonstrate that the Rieske protein is targeted across the thylakoid membrane by the ΔpH-dependent TAT pathway. In the presence of nigericin, an ionophore that dissipates the transthylakoidal proton gradient, thylakoid translocation of the Rieske protein is almost abolished, and only minute amounts are found associated with the thylakoid membrane (Fig. 3). Transport inhibition cannot be cured by supplementing the assays with increased amounts of ATP, in contrast to the findings for Sec-dependent transport (38Mant A. Schmidt I. Herrmann R.G. Robinson C. Klösgen R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23275-23281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), proving that it is the proton gradient itself (rather than its influence on ATP synthesis) that is required for the translocation process. Transport of the Rieske protein is furthermore impaired by saturating amounts of TAT-specific competitor proteins such as the precursor of the 23-kDa subunit of the oxygen-evolving system. Raising the concentration of competitor in the assays decreases the thylakoid transport of the Rieske protein until at a competitor concentration of 0.5 μm, the protein accumulates almost quantitatively in the stromal space after import (Fig. 4). This demonstrates that the Rieske and the 23-kDa protein depend on the same translocation machinery for their transport across the thylakoid membrane. Sec-dependent protein transport (which was analyzed in parallel) is not affected under these conditions (Ref. 39Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Pakrasi H. Klösgen R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholarand data not shown), confirming that competition was pathway-specific. While the results so far clearly demonstrate transport of the Rieske protein by the ΔpH/TAT pathway, other features of the transport process suggest some deviation from this route. In the presence of sodium azide, a potent inhibitor of Sec-dependent protein transport in prokaryotes and chloroplasts (40Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 41Knott T. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7843-7846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Yuan J. Henry R. McCaffery M. Cline K. Science. 1994; 266: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), thylakoid transport of the Rieske protein is affected (Fig. 5 A). The inhibitory effect is moderate but still specific because transport of typical ΔpH/TAT substrates such as the 23-kDa subunit of the oxygen-evolving system is not disturbed by the antimetabolite (Fig.5 B). At first glance, this suggests the involvement of SecA in the transport process, the azide-sensitive translocation ATPase of the Sec pathway (40Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, it should be considered that sodium azide is not only an inhibitor of SecA function but is able to impair the activity of numerous other nucleotide-binding proteins (e.g. Ref. 43Muneyuki E. Makino M. Kamata H. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Hirata H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is particularly relevant here because spinach chloroplasts, which were used in our experiments, are known to harbor a SecA protein that is largely azide-resistant (44Berghöfer J. Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18341-18346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We therefore performed competition experiments as a complementary approach to examine the possible involvement of the Sec machinery in Rieske transport. In these experiments, the thylakoidal Sec pathway was saturated by excess amounts of the precursor of the 33-kDa subunit of the oxygen-evolving system, a well characterized substrate of this transport route (38Mant A. Schmidt I. Herrmann R.G. Robinson C. Klösgen R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23275-23281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 45Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 46Hulford A. Hazell L. Mould R.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3251-3256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Yuan J. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18463-18467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, this treatment led to a significant reduction of thylakoid transport of the Rieske protein (Fig. 6 A). However, as compared with saturating the ΔpH-dependent TAT pathway by the 23-kDa precursor protein, the degree of inhibition is far less pronounced. Even at a concentration of 4 μm Sec competitor in the assays, thylakoid transport of the Rieske protein takes place with a rate close to 50% of the control level, although as little as 0.5 μm TAT competitor is sufficient to block thylakoid transport of the protein completely (Fig. 4). Still, saturation of the Sec machinery causes a true competitive effect because the degree of inhibition varies with the concentration of the competitor in the assays (Fig. 6 A). The specificity of the reaction was confirmed in control experiments in which the 23- and 33-kDa subunits of the oxygen-evolving system were imported in the presence of the Sec competitor. As expected, only the Sec pathway is saturated under these conditions, as demonstrated by the appearance of the stromal intermediate of the 33-kDa protein (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, the ΔpH-dependent thylakoid transport route is not affected by the Sec competitor. Only transport of the 23-kDa protein across the chloroplast envelope is impaired by the competitor to a certain extent, which confirms that both proteins are imported by the same translocase into the organelle. These results strongly suggest that the Rieske protein, although translocated across the thylakoid membrane by the ΔpH/TAT translocase, depends for its correct targeting on the availability of components also involved in Sec-dependent protein targeting. However, it appears unlikely that the whole process of thylakoid targeting and translocation can be mediated solely by the Sec machinery because in this case, the complete block of Rieske transport in the presence of the 23-kDa TAT competitor protein could not be explained. As an initial step to identify the components involved in the intraorganellar targeting of the Rieske protein, we recovered the stromal fraction after the import experiment and analyzed it in nondenaturing gel systems. Unexpectedly, the Rieske protein was found in several distinct complexes in the chloroplast stroma ranging in size from ∼130 to more than 700 kDa (Fig.7). The size of the latter corresponds well with that of the stromal cpn60 complex (48Hemmingsen S.M. Woolford C. van der Vies S.M. Tilly K. Dennis D.T. Georgopoulos C.P. Hendrix R.W. Ellis R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 49Lubben T.H. Donaldson G.K. Viitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 1223-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation experiments could demonstrate that a substantial amount of the newly imported Rieske protein is associated with this chaperonine (Fig. 8), which corroborates earlier observations of Madueno et al. (50Madueno F. Napier J.A. Gray J.C. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1865-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is particularly remarkable that not only the processed, mature size Rieske protein but also its unprocessed precursor is found associated with this chaperonine. Actually, the Rieske precursor shows even a much higher affinity to cpn60 than the mature protein, which is co-immunoprecipitated by the antisera only to a minor extent (<10%; Fig. 8). These results suggest that the Rieske protein interacts with the cpn60 complex very early in the translocation process, even before the removal of the transit peptide by the stromal processing peptidase. This interaction might even be mediated by the protein transport machinery of the inner envelope membrane in chloroplasts because some cpn60 was found in close contact with the translocase (51Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).Figure 8The Rieske protein binds to the stromal cpn60 chaperonine complex immediately after import into the chloroplast.Stromal fraction recovered from spinach chloroplasts after the import of radiolabeled Rieske precursor (p) protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation for 1 h at 4 °C using antisera raised against Hsp60 from yeast mitochondria (B). Lane 1contains 10% of the stromal proteins that remained in the supernatant after immunoprecipitation. In lane 2, the whole pellet containing all proteins that were co-immunoprecipitated by the antibodies was loaded. For comparison, the autoradiograph of the import experiment used for immunoprecipitation is presented in A. For further details, see the legend for Fig. 1. m, mature polypeptide; t, translation assay; s, stroma.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cpn60 is probably not a binding partner for all the proteins imported into the chloroplast, however, because no interaction with the 33-kDa protein could be observed in import experiments, neither in native gel systems nor by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 7 and data not shown). Instead, the stromal intermediate of the 33-kDa polypeptide, which was obtained by supplementing the import assays with nigericin (38Mant A. Schmidt I. Herrmann R.G. Robinson C. Klösgen R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23275-23281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), accumulates in at least four distinct complexes of ∼150, 180, 200, and 220 kDa (Fig. 7). This multitude of stromal interactions was totally unexpected because so far, only an interaction with SecA was assumed (42Yuan J. Henry R. McCaffery M. Cline K. Science. 1994; 266: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the Rieske protein also accumulates, in addition to the cpn60 complex, in several complexes of a similar size range (∼120–250 kDa, Fig. 7). These complexes are not well resolved, however, suggesting a limited stability and/or variable composition. Although the overall pattern of stromal complexes formed by the Rieske protein and the 33-kDa protein is rather different, it appears possible that at least one of the components required for complex formation interacts with both thylakoid proteins during passage through the chloroplast stroma. This could then cause the competition observed between the Rieske protein and the 33-kDa protein, despite the fact that the two proteins finally utilize different transport machineries in the thylakoid system for their membrane translocation. The Rieske protein of the cytochromeb 6 /f complex in chloroplasts is transported to and across the thylakoid membrane with a mechanism that is unique among those of all chloroplast proteins analyzed so far. While the actual membrane transport is mediated by the ΔpH-dependent TAT translocase, the delivery of the protein to this translocase depends on components that are also involved in Sec-dependent protein transport. Thus, the Rieske protein represents the first link between the Sec- and the ΔpH-dependent transport routes in chloroplasts that so far were considered to operate completely independently from each other. The participation of both the ΔpH/TAT-dependent and part of the Sec-dependent transport machineries in Rieske transport becomes evident in competition experiments. Saturating the two pathways independently from each other by specific competitor proteins in each case affects the thylakoid transport of the Rieske protein, although to a different extent. In the presence of TAT competitor (23-kDa protein), transport of the Rieske protein is completely abolished (Fig. 4), demonstrating that a functional ΔpH/TAT pathway is essential for its membrane transport. Because the 23-kDa protein that was used as the competitor traverses the stromal space as a tightly folded monomer, probably without interacting with the stromal targeting and folding machinery (14Creighton A.M. Hulford A. Mant A. Robinson D. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1663-1669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it is likely that its competition with the Rieske protein occurs at the thylakoid membrane, presumably at the receptor or at the translocase itself. The inhibitory effect observed with the Sec competitor (33-kDa protein), on the other hand, requires a significantly higher concentration of competitor protein and still does not lead to a complete block of the thylakoid transport process (Fig. 6 A). This suggests that competition in this case is caused by saturating a relatively abundant targeting factor rather than the translocase at the membrane. There are numerous candidates for such targeting factors in the chloroplast stroma. As shown by native gel electrophoresis, both the Rieske protein and the 33-kDa polypeptide interact after import into the organelle with several stromal complexes of high molecular mass. It remains elusive, however, which of these complexes represents true transport intermediates and could thus be responsible for the observed competition. Because of the size difference of the two proteins analyzed, co-migration even of corresponding protein complexes cannot be expected, so this point remains unsolved at the moment. However, it is already remarkable that there is such a multitude of interactions for proteins passing through the chloroplast stroma on their way to the thylakoids. This suggests a much higher degree of complexity in the recruitment of targeting factors than anticipated so far. Apparently, stromal factors in addition to SecA are involved in Sec-dependent protein targeting of the 33-kDa protein. Even more striking, the Rieske protein is the first example of a protein transported by the ΔpH-dependent pathway in chloroplasts that shows interaction with, and probably requirement for, stromal components in the targeting process. Thus, protein transport by the ΔpH/TAT pathway can no longer be strictly distinguished by its independence of stromal factors. It will be interesting to examine whether the demand for stromal factors in the intraorganellar targeting of the Rieske protein is created by the transport signal or by its “passenger,”i.e. the hydrophilic domain that is translocated across the thylakoid membrane. Interaction of the hydrophilic domain with stromal components might, for example, be required for the assembly of the iron-sulfur cluster into the apoprotein if this process takes place in the chloroplast stroma. A precedent for such a scenario is found in yeast mitochondria, which house an essential part of the machinery for the biogenesis of Fe/S proteins in their matrix (52Lill R. Diekert K. Kaut A. Lange H. Pelzer W. Prohl C. Kispal G. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Stromal assembly of the Fe/S cluster and, consequently, at least partial folding of the Rieske protein prior to membrane transfer would also be in line with transport by the ΔpH/TAT translocase, which is capable of translocating folded protein domains across the membrane (15Clark S.A. Theg S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 923-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 16Hynds P.J. Robinson D. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34868-34874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It would furthermore explain why the Rieske protein but not the 33-kDa polypeptide interacts in the stroma with the cpn60 chaperonine (Fig.7), the chloroplast homolog of the hsp60 folding machinery of mitochondria and prokaryotes (48Hemmingsen S.M. Woolford C. van der Vies S.M. Tilly K. Dennis D.T. Georgopoulos C.P. Hendrix R.W. Ellis R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 53Goloubinoff P. Christeller J.T.

Nature. 1989; 341: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Sec-dependent targeting of the 33-kDa protein requires the unfolded polypeptide (55Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and any folding of the protein in the stroma would probably impair its membrane translocation. Stromal retardation of the Rieske protein to allow for cofactor assembly and folding might also be the cause for the exceptional structure of its thylakoid transport signal. Not only is it the first membrane anchor signal known for thylakoid proteins, but it furthermore lacks the twin-R motif, which is indicative for ΔpH/TAT-targeting signals. Instead, a KR-sequence is found at the corresponding position in all Rieske proteins from higher plant chloroplasts characterized to date, which should essentially prevent transport of the protein across the membrane (19Halbig D. Hou B. Freudl R. Sprenger G.A. Klösgen R.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Chaddock A.M. Mant A. Karnauchov I. Brink S. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cyanobacteria, which are the closest relatives to the endosymbiotic ancestors of chloroplasts known today, possess Rieske proteins with perfect twin-R motifs in their presumed targeting signals. It is therefore appealing to speculate that the thylakoid transport signal of the Rieske protein was modified after the phylogenetic transfer of the gene into the nucleus in order to slow down the passage of the protein through the stromal space to the thylakoid membrane, thereby providing sufficient time for the assembly of the Fe/S cluster. Taken together, the exceptional transport mechanism of the Rieske protein, which is the only chloroplast protein with cyanobacterial homologs known so far that is targeted by the thylakoidal ΔpH/TAT pathway, suggests that it is an ancient substrate of this pathway and thus can be considered as a missing link in the evolution of the protein transport pathways operating at the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts.

MAGI-2 is a multidomain scaffolding protein that contains nine potential protein-protein interaction modules, including 6 PDZ domains, 2 WW domains, and a guanylate kinase-like domain. The β1AR carboxyl terminus binds with high affinity to the first PDZ domain of MAGI-2, with the last few amino acids of the β1AR carboxyl terminus being the key determinants of the interaction. In cells, the association of full-length β1AR with MAGI-2 occurs constitutively and is enhanced by agonist stimulation of the receptor, as assessed by both co-immunoprecipitation experiments and immunofluorescence co-localization studies. Agonist-induced internalization of the β1AR is markedly increased by co-expression with MAGI-2. Strikingly, this result is the opposite of the effect of co-expression with PSD-95, a previously reported binding partner of the β1AR. Further cellular experiments revealed that MAGI-2 has no effect on β1AR oligomerization but does promote association of β1AR with the cytoplasmic signaling protein β-catenin, a known MAGI-2 binding partner. These data reveal that MAGI-2 is a specific β1AR binding partner that modulates β1AR function and facilitates the physical association of the β1AR with intracellular proteins involved in signal transduction and synaptic regulation.

For example, long-term potentiation of synaptic responses, a phenomenon believed to underlie some forms of long-lasting memory, is greatly promoted by noradrenergic stimulation in a number of brain regions (1Hopkins W.F.

The effects of norepinephrine on synaptic plasticity are mediated largely through activation of the β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR),1 since mice lacking β1AR fail to exhibit regulation of long-term potentiation by adrenergic stimulation (9Winder D.G.

Pharmacological blockade of brain β1-adrenergic receptors not only hinders the development of synaptic plasticity, it is also known to impair memory formation (12Flexner J.B. Flexner L.B. Church A.C.

The family of β-adrenergic receptors includes three subtypes, β1AR, β2AR, and β3AR, with β1AR and β2AR being the subtypes found most abundantly in the brain. β2-Adrenergic receptors in the central nervous system are expressed mainly in glia (18Cash R.

Raisman R. Lanfumey L. Ploska A. Agid Y. Brain Res. 1986; 370: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,19Waeber C. Rigo M. Chinaglia G. Probst A. Palacios J.

The synaptic localization of the β1AR in the brain is believed to be important for the aforementioned modulation of synaptic plasticity by β1-adrenergic receptors (1Hopkins W.F. Johnston D. J.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 570-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is therefore a point of major interest to understand the mechanisms controlling β1AR subcellular trafficking in neurons. Synaptic targeting of receptors and channels in the brain can often be promoted by association of the receptors and channels with specific scaffolding proteins (23Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that the β1AR can associate with the synaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 (24Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). PSD-95 contains three PDZ domains, which are conserved modules of ∼90 amino acids that mediate association with specific motifs on the carboxyl termini of target proteins (25Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). The third PDZ domain of PSD-95 specifically associates with the carboxyl terminus of the β1AR, and this interaction promotes the physical linkage of the β1AR to other PSD-95-associated synaptic proteins such as N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors and also regulates β1AR internalization (24Hu L.A.

While the interaction of β1AR and PSD-95 is likely to be physiological important for β1AR subcellular targetingin vivo, it should be noted that the distributions of β1AR (26Frielle T. Collins S.

There are a number of cellular populations where β1AR is known to be highly expressed but PSD-95 is not detectable. The potential determinants of β1AR targeting in neurons or other cells not expressing PSD-95 are unknown. We have identified another PDZ domain-containing scaffolding protein, MAGI-2 (membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted-2) (32Wood J.D. Yuan J. Margolis R.L. Colomer V. Duan K. Kushi J. Kaminsky Z. Kleiderlein J.J. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), a protein also known as S-SCAM (synaptic scaffoldingmolecule), as a high-affinity cellular binding partner of the β1AR. While MAGI-2 and PSD-95 are structurally related PDZ proteins, we have found that they exhibit diametrically opposed effects on β1AR internalization: MAGI-2 strongly promotes β1AR internalization, whereas PSD-95 markedly inhibits it. The studies reported here describe the interaction of β1AR with MAGI-2, and furthermore, describe the structural determinants of this interaction and its effects on β1AR function. Mammalian expression plasmids pcDNA3/Flag-β1AR and pcDNA3/Flag-β2AR were described before (24Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The mammalian expression plasmid for pCMV/HA-β1AR was kindly provided by Hitoshi Kurose (University of Tokyo). To express GST fusion proteins of receptor carboxyl termini, β1AR-CT (the carboxyl-terminal 100 amino acids of the human β1AR), β2AR-CT (the carboxyl-terminal 80 amino acids of the human β2AR), and α1AAR-CT (the carboxyl-terminal 136 amino acids of the human α1AAR, prepared from a cDNA provided by Kenneth Minneman, Emory University) were amplified by PCR and then subcloned into pGEX-4T1 using the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. Point mutations of the β1AR-CT were introduced by PCR and verified by ABI sequencing. The MAGI-2 PDZ1, PDZ2, PDZ3, PDZ4, and PDZ5 constructs were prepared via PCR from a human MAGI-2/AIP1 cDNA (32Wood J.D. Yuan J. Margolis R.L. Colomer V. Duan K. Kushi J. Kaminsky Z. Kleiderlein J.J. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The MAGI-2 PDZ1 (corresponding to amino acids 420 through 559 of human MAGI-2), PDZ2 (599), PDZ3 (772), PDZ4 (915–1049), and PDZ5 (1140–1265) were inserted into the pET30A vector (Novagen) at the EcoRI and XhoI sites. The PDZ1 domain of MAGI-1/AIP3 (32Wood J.D. Yuan J. Margolis R.L. Colomer V. Duan K. Kushi J. Kaminsky Z. Kleiderlein J.J. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (corresponding to amino acids 446–571 of human MAGI-1) was also prepared via PCR and inserted into pET30A for expression as a hexahistidine-tagged and S-tagged fusion protein. The PSD-95 “PDZ1+2” and “PDZ3” constructs were prepared via PCR from a rat PSD-95 cDNA kindly provided by Morgan Sheng (Harvard Medical School). The PDZ1+2 (corresponding to amino acids 59–303 of rat PSD-95) and PDZ3 (corresponding to amino acids 307–446) were inserted into pET30A using EcoRI and XhoI sites introduced during PCR. The nNOS PDZ domain (corresponding to amino acids 1–150, prepared from a rat nNOS cDNA kindly provided by Thomas Michel, Harvard Medical School) was also prepared via PCR and inserted into pET30A at the EcoRI and XhoI sites. The NHERF-1 PDZ domain constructs in pET30A have been described previously (33Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.-W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J.

Monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) 12CA5 antibody was fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-β-catenin antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-Flag M2 antibody and anti-Flag M2 affinity gel were from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All tissue culture media and related reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. HEK-293 cells were maintained in complete medium (minimal essential medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. For transient transfection, 2 µg of total DNA was mixed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and added to 5 ml of serum-free medium in 100-mm tissue culture plates containing HEK-293 cells at ∼50–80% confluency. Following a 3-h incubation, 6 ml of complete medium was added. Twenty-four hours later, the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24–48 h before harvesting. Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm benzamidine, 1% Triton X-100) on ice for 30 min. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 21,000 × gfor 12 min at 4 °C. The clarified supernatants were then used in all following in vitro GST pull-down or cellular co-immunoprecipitation experiments. 50 µl of such supernatant was diluted into equal amount 3 times sample buffer and served as whole cell extract. Samples (5–10 µg/lane) were run on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels (Novex, San Diego) for 1 h at 150 V and then transferred to pure nitrocellulose. The blots were blocked in a buffer consisting of 2% milk, 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS (“blot buffer”) for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated with primary antibody in blot buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed three times with blot buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in blot buffer. Following three final washes with blot buffer and one wash with PBS, bands were visualized via chemiluminescence with the ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose beads. Aliquots of the fusion protein/bead mixture in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes were blocked for 1 h with 1 ml of a 3% bovine serum albumin buffer (containing 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) on ice for 30 min. Equal concentrations of various His/S-tagged fusion proteins were then incubated with the beads in 1 ml of the 3% bovine serum albumin blocking buffer at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation for 1 h. The beads were washed five times with ice-cold 3% bovine serum albumin blocking buffer and washed once with harvest buffer (20 mmHEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmbenzamidine, 1% Triton X-100). The proteins were eluted from the beads with 1 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved via SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The His-tagged fusion proteins were detected via Western blotting with S-protein horseradish peroxidase conjugate from Novagen (1:4000), and bands were visualized via chemiluminescence. For experiments involving pull-downs from cell lysates, the procedure was the same except that pulled-down proteins were detected on the Western blot using appropriate antibodies (e.g. anti-β-catenin antibodies to detect pulled-down β-catenin). Cells were harvested and lysed in 500 µl of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.5% Triton X-100). The lysate was solubilized via end-over-end rotation at 4 °C for 30 min and clarified via centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. A small fraction of the supernatant was taken at this point and incubated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer in order to examine expression of proteins in the whole cell extract. The remaining supernatant was incubated with 30 µl of anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for 2 h with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C. After five washes with 1.0 ml of lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the beads with 1 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis with appropriate antibodies. The binding of receptor carboxyl terminus GST fusion proteins to His/S-tagged PDZ domain fusion proteins was assayed via a blot overlay technique. The His/S-tagged PDZ domains (2 µg/lane) were run on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels (Novex, San Diego), blotted, and overlaid with the receptor CT-GST fusion proteins (50 nm final concentration) in a buffer consisting of 2% milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (blot buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed three times with blot buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a monoclonal anti-GST antibody. The blots were then washed again three times with blot buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody in blot buffer. Following three final washes with blot buffer, the binding of the GST fusion proteins was visualized via chemiluminescence as described above. In the reverse experiments, the GST fusion proteins were run on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and then overlaid with the His/S-tagged PDZ domains in blot buffer. For these experiments, the bound His/S-tagged proteins were detected via incubation of the blots with S protein horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:4000) followed by chemiluminescence. Receptor internalization was assayed using a previously described method (35Hall R.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4135-4140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-293 cells in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with pcDNA3/Flag-β1AR in the absence and presence of pcDNA3/HA-MAGI-2. One day after transfection, cells were split into new dishes and grown overnight at 37 °C. On the second day, cells were treated with 50 µm isoproteronol for 10 min. Cells were then immediately washed with PBS twice, placed at 4 °C, and incubated with 1 mg/ml of the membrane-impermeable cross-linking reagent BS3 30 min. After washing the cells with PBS containing Tris (to quench any residual cross-linker), the cells were harvested in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm benzamidine, 1% Triton X-100). Cell lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE. Flag-tagged receptors were visualized via Western blot with an anti-Flag M2 Ab followed by an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG Ab as described above. Bands for cross-linked-β1AR (high-molecular band, representing surface receptor) and non-cross-linked-β1AR (56 kDa, representing receptor not on the surface) were visualized via chemiluminescence and quantified using a densitometer. Multiple control experiments revealed that intracellular proteins, such as actin and tubulin, were not cross-linked by the BS3 treatment, indicating that the BS3 was acting only on surface-expressed transmembrane proteins (actin and tubulin were both detected on the blots with antibodies from Sigma). Receptor internalization was defined as the percentage reduction in surface receptors following agonist stimulation, relative to matched control cells that were not stimulated with isoproterenol. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3/Flag-β1AR and/or pcDNA3/HA-MAGI-2. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's PBS and then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 50 µmisoproterenol. Following this incubation, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. To visualize the subcellular localization of β1AR and MAGI-2, cells were blocked and permeabilized with a buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.04% saponin (“saponin buffer”) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with anti-Flag M2 monoclonal Ab (Sigma) at a 1:500 dilution and/or a rabbit polyclonal anti-MAGI-2 Ab (36Wu X. Hepner K. Castelino-Prabhu S. Do D. Kaye M.B. Yuan X.J. Wood J. Ross C. Sawyers C.L. Whang Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4233-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) at a 1:500 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes (1 min) with saponin buffer, the cells were incubated with a Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG Ab (1:200) and/or a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes (1 min) with saponin buffer and one wash with PBS, coverslips were mounted and Texas Red-labeled receptors and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled MAGI-2 were visualized with a Zeiss LSM-410 laser confocal microscope. Multiple control experiments, utilizing either transfected cells in the absence of primary antibody or untransfected cells in the presence of primary antibody, revealed a very low level of background staining, indicating that the primary antibody-dependent immunostaining observed in the transfected cells was specific. In order to identify potential cytoplasmic binding partners of the β1-adrenergic receptor, the carboxyl terminus of the human β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR-CT) was prepared as a GST fusion protein and utilized in blot overlay studies of brain and heart tissue, two areas where β1AR is abundantly expressed. These studies were carried out in conjunction with yeast two-hybrid screens of a brain cDNA library utilizing the β1AR-CT as bait. The yeast two-hybrid screens, as previously described (24Hu L.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), yielded two interacting clones corresponding to overlapping regions of PSD-95, a brain-specific protein of 95 kDa. In contrast, the blot overlay studies with the β1AR-CT-GST revealed a single major interacting band at ∼170 kDa (Fig. 1). This band was detected in brain but not heart (Fig. 1C), and was not detected by overlays with GST alone (Fig. 1B). The GST moiety of the β1AR-CT-GST fusion protein bound nonspecifically to several bands in the heart and brain lysates, however, including a band in the range of 95–100 kDa. This nonspecific GST-binding band made it difficult to assess whether the β1AR-CT-GST might be associating with a 95-kDa species in the brain lysate corresponding to PSD-95. Nonetheless, the 170-kDa band detected specifically by the β1AR-CT-GST in the brain was clearly too large to correspond to PSD-95, and thus we set out to identify this protein. The β1AR-CT interacts with PSD-95 via the PDZ3 domain of PSD-95 (24Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Reasoning that the β1AR-CT interacting protein observed in our blot overlays might exhibit structural similarity to this domain, we performed BLAST searches with the protein sequence of PSD-95 PDZ3. These searches revealed a list of several dozen proteins exhibiting significant homology to PSD-95 PDZ3, but the vast majority of these matches were proteins of less than 100 kDa in size. The only protein on the list that matched the size of the β1AR-CT-interacting protein seen in our blot overlays was MAGI-2, a 170-kDa brain-specific protein that contains several PDZ domains with significant similarity to PSD-95 PDZ3. We therefore probed our samples of the heart and brain lysate with an anti-MAGI-2 antibody (36Wu X. Hepner K. Castelino-Prabhu S. Do D. Kaye M.B. Yuan X.J. Wood J. Ross C. Sawyers C.L. Whang Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4233-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and compared the results to those from the β1AR-CT-GST overlays. As shown in Fig. 1D, the anti-MAGI-2 antibody recognizes a major band of ∼170 kDa in the brain tissue, and this band matches up precisely in size with the β1AR-CT interacting protein observed in our overlay experiments. We next directly tested the potential interaction of MAGI-2 with the β1AR-CT using purified fusion proteins. His-tagged fusion proteins corresponding to PDZ1–5 of MAGI-2 were purified and examined in blot overlay experiments for binding to the β1AR-CT-GST. As shown in Fig.2A, the β1AR-CT-GST bound robustly to PDZ1 and weakly or not at all to the other four PDZ domains. When probed against a panel of various PDZ domains, the β1AR-CT-GST bound not only to the first PDZ domain of MAGI-2, but also to the first PDZ domain of a related protein, MAGI-1, and also to the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 (Fig. 2B, upper panel). The binding of the β1AR-CT-GST to the MAGI-2 PDZ1 domain was comparable to the binding of the β1AR-CT-GST to PSD-95 PDZ3. No binding of the β1AR-CT-GST was observed to PSD95 PDZ1+2, nor to the PDZ domains of NHERF-1 or nNOS, demonstrating the specificity of interaction between the β1AR-CT-GST and the MAGI PDZ1 and PSD-95 PDZ3 domains. In contrast to the β1AR-CT-GST, the β2AR-CT-GST did not bind at all to any of the MAGI or PSD-95 PDZ domains (Fig. 2B, lower panel), but rather bound specifically to PDZ1 of NHERF-1, as previously reported (33Hall R.A.

This equilibrium is maintained by the presence of inefficient splice sites. The A3 3′-splice site of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) is required for Tat mRNA production. The infrequent utilization of this splice site has been attributed to the presence of a suboptimal polypyrimidine tract and an exonic splicing silencer (ESS2) intat exon 2 ∼60 nucleotides downstream of 3′-splice site A3. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis followed by analysis of splicing in vitro and in HeLa cells, we show that the 5′ extremity of tat exon 2 contains a second exonic splicing silencer (ESS2p), which acts to repress splice site A3. The inhibitory property of this exonic silencer was active when inserted downstream of another HIV-1 3′-splice site (A2). Protein hnRNP H binds to this inhibitory element, and two U-to-C substitutions within the ESS2p element cause a decreased hnRNP H affinity with a concomitant increase in splicing efficiency at 3′-splice site A3. This suggests that hnRNP H is directly involved in splicing inhibition. We propose that hnRNP H binds to the HIV-1 ESS2p element and competes with U2AF35for binding to the exon sequence flanking 3′-splice site A3.

To ensure this equilibrium, retroviral RNAs generally have splice sites that are used with low efficiencies. In human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1), 3′-splice sites (3′ss)1 and several central 3′ss (A3, A4a, A4b, A4c, and A5) compete with each other (Fig.1A).

The affinity of factor U2AF for the PPT depends upon the presence of a long stretch of U residues (9Reed R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2113-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 16Roscigno R.F.

Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar).

Furthermore, suboptimal 3′ss are often the subject of positive or negative regulation by cis-regulatory elements, which are frequently located in the 3′ exon. Exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) increase the utilization of upstream 3′ss by binding of nuclear components that favor the association of spliceosomal components. Several identified ESEs were found to bind serine arginine-rich proteins (20Stark J.M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Herfort M. Roth M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One of the ESSs (ESS2) is located within tat exon 2 and regulates the utilization of the A3 3′ss (Fig. 1A) (14Si Z. Amendt B.A. Stoltzfus C.M.

Krainer A.R. Stoltzfus C.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8487-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). HnRNP A/B proteins were found to selectively bind both the HIV-1 ESS2 and ESSV elements, and this binding is necessary for the inhibitory properties of these ESS elements (33Bilodeau P.S. Domsic J.K.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4060-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The hnRNP proteins are a family of nuclear proteins that package nascent pre-messenger RNAs early after their transcription by RNA polymerase II (for review, see Ref. 35Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). HnRNPs are involved in several steps of mRNA production, including transcription regulation, modulation of alternative splicing, and mRNA stabilization and localization (for review, Ref. 35Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar).

Its involvement in inhibition of 3′ss utilization by binding to ESSs was found more recently, and, in this case, the mechanism of inhibition is still unknown. HnRNP H was found to bind both ESE (c-src ESE (41Chou M.Y. Rooke N. Turck C.W. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and ESS (26Chen C.D. Kobayashi R. Helfman D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar)) elements. We recently proposed a model for the secondary structure of the HIV-1 RNA region containing the five central 3′ss (A3, A4a, A4b, A4c, and A5) (42Jacquenet S. Ropers D. Damier L. Mougin A. Bilodeau P.S. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Splice site A3 is contained in the terminal loop of a conserved stem-loop structure (SLS2), and its suboptimal PPT is in the helix. To complete this previous study, we looked for the interdependence between sequence and secondary structure at site A3 and generated mutations in both the PPT and the opposite strand of SLS2. Analysis of these mutants revealed the presence of a second ESS element acting to repress splicing at 3′-splice site A3 (ESS2p). Demonstration of the presence of this ESS2p element and the possible involvement of protein hnRNP H as a mediator of its inhibitory property are presented in this report. Plasmid pBRU3 (43Charneau P. Alizon M. Clavel F. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the source of cDNA sequences from the HIV-1 BRU/LAI strain (GenBankTM accession number K02013). PCR amplifications were done according to Nour et al. (44Nour M. Naimi A. Beck G. Branlant C. Curr. Microbiol. 1995; 31: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Three DNA fragments, H1, H2, and H3, corresponding to the HIV-1/BRU cDNA regions 1–385, 5172–5408, and 5172–5637, respectively (numbering according to ref. 45Ratner L. Haseltine W. Patarca R.

All the constructs were made in plasmid pBluescriptKSII+ cleaved with the BamHI andPstI nucleases. PCR-amplified fragments were digested at restriction sites generated by the primers (see Table I). In plasmid pLD-C3, fragments H1 and H2 have been ligated together using theirBglII restriction sites. Similarly, in plasmid pLD-L3.U1, fragments H1 and H3 have been ligated together. Plasmid pLD-C2 contains the HIV-1/BRU RNA regions 1–385 and 4669–5053 (10Damier L. Domenjoud L. Branlant C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Plasmid pΔPSP, used for the transfection experiments, was constructed in the following way. Infectious HIV-1 plasmid pNL4-3 (GenBankTM accession number M19921) was cleaved with SpeI and BalI nucleases to generate an 11.9-kb fragment. This fragment was ligated together with oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGACGCGTTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAAACGCGT-3′, which had been previously annealed, to form a double-stranded linker. This created an HIV-1 plasmid deleted between nt 1511 and 4551.Table IThe oligonucleotides used in this studyPrimer numberSequence (5′ → 3′)Restriction siteHIV-1/BRU sequenceUtilizationGenerated variantO-605TATTCTGGATCCGGTCTCTCTGGTBamHI1–12 (i)PCRO-606TATTCTAGATCTCCCATCGATCTABglII373–385 (c)PCRO-567AGAAGACCAAGATCTAGAGGGAGCCABglII5155–5165 andPCR5172–5182 (i)O-608TATTCTCTGCAGTTGCTCTCCTCTPstI5397–5408 (c)PCRPrimer extensionO-755CACCTAGGGCTAACTATATG5001–5020 (c)PCRO-1114GCTTAAGGCTGCAGGTACTACTTACTGCTTTGATAGAGAAACTTGPstI5607–5637 (c)PCRO-1715CGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAATTGGGTGTCGACATAGC5359–5377 (i)PCRE2-C3-WT (T7)O-1734CGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAATaGGGaGTCGACATAGC5359–5377 (i)PCRE2-C3-A (T7)O-1738CGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAATcGGGcGTCGACATAGC5359–5377 (i)PCRE2-C3-C (T7)O-1987CGCGATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAGATTGGGTGTCTCTGCTATAAG4972–4984 (i)PCRE2-C2-ESS2p (SP6)O-1988CGCGATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAGACTCTGCTATAAGAAAGGC4972–4990 (i)PCRE2-C2-WT (SP6)O-1989CGCGATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAGATGTCGACATAGCAGAATAG5360–5384 (i)PCRE2-C3ΔESS2p (SP6)O-1990CGCGATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAGATcGGGcGTCGACATAGC5360–5377 (i)PCRE2-C3-C (SP6)O-1991CGCGATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAGATTGGGTGTCGACATAGC5360–5377 (i)PCRE2-C3-WT (SP6)O-1992CGCGATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAGATaGGGaGTCGACATAGC5360–5377 (i)PCRE2-C3-A (SP6)O-1227CAACTGCTGTTTtTCCtTTTCAGAATTGG5336–5364 (i)MutagenesispSJ-C3–1227O-1228CCtTTTCAGAATaGGGaGTCGACATAGC5350–5377 (i)MutagenesispSJ-C3–1228O-1284GCTATGTCGACTCCCTATTCTGAAAAGG5350–5377 (c)MutagenesispSJ-C3–1228O-1606TTTCAGAATcGGGcGTCGACATAG5353–5377 (i)MutagenesispSJ-C3–1606O-1607CTATGTCGACgCCCgATTCTGAAA5353–5377 (c)MutagenesispSJ-C3–1606O-1691TTTCAGAATaGGGTGTCGACATAG5353–5377 (i)MutagenesispSJ-C3–1691O-1692CTATGTCGACACCCtATTCTGAAA5353–5377 (c)MutagenesispSJ-C3–1691O-1693TTTCAGAATTGGGaGTCGACATAG5353–5377 (i)MutagenesispSJ-C3–1693O-1694CTATGTCGACtCCCAATTCTGAAA5353–5377 (c)MutagenesispSJ-C3–1693O-1695TTTCAGAATaGGGaGTCGACATAG5353–5377 (i)MutagenesispSJ-C3–1695O-1696CTATGTCGACtCCCtATTCTGAAA5353–5377 (c)MutagenesispSJ-C3–1695O-1697TTTCAGAATTaGGTGTCGACATAG5353–5377 (i)MutagenesispSJ-C3–1697O-1698CTATGTCGACACCtAATTCTGAAA5353–5377 (c)MutagenesispSJ-C3–1697O-1728CCATTTCAGAATCGACATAGCAG5350–5379 (i)MutagenesispSJ-C3ΔESS2pO-1729CTGCTATGTCGATTCTGAAATGG5350–5379 (c)MutagenesispSJ-C3ΔESS2pO-1730CTGTTTTTCAGAattgggtgtCTCTGCTATAAG4961–4984 (i)MutagenesispSJ-C2-ESS2pO-1731CTTATAGCAGAGacacccaatTCTGAAAAACAG4961–4984 (c)MutagenesispSJ-C2-ESS2pL3-senseAATTCTGCAACAACTGCTGTTTATCCATTTCAGAATaGGGaGEcoR I5326–5367 (i)MutagenesispΔPSP-1695L3-antisenseTCGACtCCCtATTCTGAAATGGATAAACAGCAGTTGTTGCAGSal I5330–5371 (c)MutagenesispΔPSP-1695The number, the sequence, and the utilization of each oligonucleotide are given.

To generate plasmid pSJ-C3-1227, the inserted BamHI-PstI fragment of plasmid pLD-C3 was cloned into phage M13mp9 and site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to Kramer et al. (46Kramer W. Drutsa V. Jansen H.W. Kramer B. Pflugfelder M. Fritz H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 9441-9456Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), using oligonucleotide O-1227 (see Table I). The mutagenizedBamHI-PstI DNA fragment was reinserted into plasmid pBluescriptKSII+. All other site-directed mutagenesis analyses were performed by the PCR method, using the Stratagene QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit. The resulting plasmids are shown in Table I. pΔPSP variants were constructed by replacement of the HIV-1/pNL4-3EcoRI-Bsu36I fragment (positions 5743–5955) by the corresponding HIV-1/BRU EcoRI-Bsu36I fragment (positions 5325–5537) from plasmids pLD-L3.U1, pSJ-L3.U1-1227, or pSJ-L3.U1-1228. To create the pΔPSP-1695 variant plasmid, pΔPSP was cleaved with EcoRI and SalI nucleases and ligated together with oligonucleotides L3A-sense and L3A-antisense (see TableI), which had been previously annealed, to form a double-stranded mutated linker with EcoRI and SalI sticky ends. To create variants pΔPSP-1691, pΔPSP-1693, and pΔPSP-1606, theEcoRI/XhoI fragment from pΔPSP WT was cloned in plasmid pBluescriptKSII+ cleaved by the same enzymes and the mutations were generated by the PCR method, using the appropriate primers (Table I). The EcoRI/BamHI fragments from these mutant constructs in pBluescriptKSII+ (nt 5743–8465) were ligated into pΔPSP, which was cleaved with EcoRI andBamHI. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm the expected base changes or deletion. The HIV-1/BRU cDNA regions encoding the WT or variant second exon of the C3 transcript, produced from plasmid pLD-C3, were PCR-amplified from plasmid pLD-C3 with the antisense primer O-608 (see Table I) and a sense primer generating a T7 RNA polymerase promoter (for gel shift experiments) or a SP6 RNA polymerase promoter (for immunoprecipitation assays). Sense primers O-1715 (T7) or O-1991 (SP6), O-1734 (T7) or O-1992 (SP6), and O-1738 (T7) or O-1990 (SP6) (Table I) were used to amplify fragments E2-C3-WT, E2-C3-A, and E2-C3-C, respectively. Similarly, sense primer O-1989 and antisense primer O-608 were used to amplify fragment E2-C3ΔESS2p. Finally, fragments E2-C2-WT and E2-C2ESS2p were PCR-amplified from plasmid pLD-C2 using the antisense primer O-755 and the sense primers O-1988 and O-1987, respectively, which generated an SP6 RNA polymerase promoter (Table I). Synthesis of non-radioactive transcripts for RNA secondary structure analysis and enzymatic digestions with V1 RNase and S1 nuclease were performed as previously described (42Jacquenet S. Ropers D. Damier L. Mougin A. Bilodeau P.S. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Positions of enzymatic cleavages were identified by primer extension analysis with the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Life Science) using primer O-608 (Table I). Oligonucleotide primers were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP 3000 Ci/mmol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Annealing of primers and primer extension was made as previously described (42Jacquenet S. Ropers D. Damier L. Mougin A. Bilodeau P.S. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Prior to transcription with T7 RNA polymerase, the pLD-C3 and pLD-L3.U1 constructs and all their derivatives were linearized with the PstI nuclease, whereas pLD-C2 construct and all its derivatives were linearized with theEcoRI nuclease. For splicing assays, uniformly labeled capped transcripts were synthesized and in vitro splicing assays were performed with HeLa cell nuclear extracts from the Computer Cell Culture Center S.A. (Belgium), using 100,000 Cerenkov cpm (∼40 fmol) of RNA transcript per assay (10Damier L. Domenjoud L. Branlant C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was prepared on ice and then incubated at 30 °C for 120 min. Spliced products were deproteinized with proteinase K, phenol-extracted, and analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Splicing efficiency was estimated by scanning the gel with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager using ImageQuaNT software, version 3.3. The M/P ratio (amount of mature RNA versus the amount of residual precursor) was determined for each transcript, taking into account the estimated radioactivity and the number of uracil residues per molecule. HeLa cells were transfected by the modified calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique with 12 µg of plasmid DNA as described above (47Bilodeau P.S. Domsic J.K. Stoltzfus C.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9764-9772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated from transfected HeLa cells 48 h post-transfection, and 3 µg of RNA was reversed-transcribed and PCR-amplified with forward oligonucleotide primer BSS (5′-GGCTTGCTGAAGCGCGCACGGCAAGAGG-3′; nt 700–727) and reverse primer SJ4.7A, which spans sites D4 and A7 (5′-TTGGGAGGTGGGTTGCTTTGATAGAG-3′; nt 8369–8381 and 6032–6044) (47Bilodeau P.S. Domsic J.K. Stoltzfus C.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9764-9772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After verification of the presence of amplified spliced products by PAGE, amplification products (100 ng) were radiolabeled by performing a single round of PCR with the addition of 10 µCi of [α-32P]dCTP, and the products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide 7 m urea gel. DNA matrices were produced by PCR amplification using adapted primers (Table I), one of them generating a T7 or an SP6 promoter. Transcriptions were carried out on 0.9 pmol of PCR product in a 10-µl reaction mixture containing 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 units of RNasin, 4 mm each rATP, rCTP, rGTP, 0.4 mm UTP, 8 µCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) (ICN), and 70 units of T7 RNA polymerase (USB Pharmacia Biotech). Transcripts were then treated as previously described (10Damier L. Domenjoud L. Branlant C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For RNP complex formation, the following RNA binding mixture was used: 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol, 1 µg/µl yeast tRNA, and 0.5–4 µl of HeLa cell nuclear extract (Computer Cell Culture Center S.A., Belgium) in a total volume of 10.5 µl. For competition experiments, the RNA binding mixture was preincubated for 15 min at 30 °C with 20–200 ng of unradiolabeled competitor RNA, synthesized from 1.8 pmol of PCR product with the T7-MEGAshortscript kit (Ambion). All EMSAs (with or without competitor RNA) were performed with 100,000 cpm (6 pmol) of 32P-labeled transcript added to the RNA binding mixture. Incubation was performed for 15 min at 30 °C, heparin (5 µg/µl) was then added as a nonspecific competitor, and the incubation was continued for 10 min at room temperature. To test for the effect of antibodies directed against individual hnRNP proteins on the stability and the electrophoretic mobility of the shifted RNA-protein complexes, before the heparin treatment, 1 µl of a polyclonal anti-hnRNP H antiserum directed against an hnRNP H peptide located at the C terminus of the molecule (a generous gift of D. Black, University of California) (41Chou M.Y. Rooke N. Turck C.W. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) or 1 µl of the anti-hnRNP A1 monoclonal antibody 4B10 (a generous gift of G. Dreyfuss, University of Pennsylvania) were added and incubation was continued for 15 min at 30 °C. RNP complexes were then fractionated onto a 6% polyacrylamide (38:2) gel with 5% (v/v) glycerol in 1 mmEDTA, 45 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), and free and bound RNAs were visualized by autoradiography. The amount of shiftedversus free RNA or shifted versus total RNA was evaluated with a PhosphorImager using the ImageQuaNT software. To test for the presence of protein hnRNP H or hnRNP A1 in the fractionated RNA-protein complexes, the gel slices containing the RNA-protein complexes were soaked in 10 µl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 1.5 h at 37 °C and boiled 5 min. Both the piece of gel and the eluate were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (thickness of 1.5 mm). After 2 h of electrophoresis at 20 V/cm, the fractionated proteins were transferred to a Hybond C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) used for immunoblotting. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 0.1% Tween 20 (48Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and probed with anti-hnRNP H or anti-hnRNP A1 antibodies. The bound antibodies were detected with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies, respectively, and visualized by the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL detection system. Radiolabeled RNAs were produced by SP6 transcription using the suitable PCR products as matrices (Table I). SP6 RNA transcripts were synthesized in a 15-µl reaction mixture containing 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 units of RNasin, 0.3 mm each rATP, rCTP, rUTP, 3 µm GTP, 30 µCi of [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol, ICN), and 40 units of SP6 RNA polymerase (USB Pharmacia Biotech). Incubation in nuclear extract was for 15 min at 30 °C as for EMSA, except that 500,000 cpm (50 fmol) of radiolabeled transcripts was used. Formation of RNP complexes was verified by EMSA. Reaction mixtures containing RNP complexes were transferred to 96-well plates for irradiation at 4 °C with 254-nm UV light 1 cm from the source for 10 min. RNA components were then directly digested in the 96-well plates by addition of 5"

Here we report on the structural consequences of such mutations introduced into the second Zn2+ site (Site II) of the BRCA1 RING domain and their effect on the interaction with the BARD1 RING domain. Each of the BRCA1 Site II mutants still interact and form a stable heterodimer with BARD1. Limited proteolysis of BRCA1/BARD1 complexes, monitored by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectrometry, show that the mutations cause a local structural perturbation that is primarily confined to the second Zn2+ binding loop of the BRCA1 subunit. These findings are consistent with the structure of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer, which shows this region is well removed from the helices required for dimerization with BARD1. Instead, the mutations alter a region of BRCA1 that appears to be required for interaction with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes.

Zn2+ is commonly used in this role and is found at the core of a number of domains including Zinc fingers, GATA domains, hormone receptors, PHD and Lim domains, and RING domains (1Schwabe J.W.R. Klug A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These domains generally utilize a characteristic combination of cysteine and histidine residues as metal ligands. Because of the central importance of Zn2+ as a structural component, missense mutations that target Zn2+-liganding residues can adversely affect protein structure with a concomitant impairment or loss of protein function. Often Zn2+-dependent domains are found as individual components of larger multi-domain proteins. The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 encodes an 1863-residue protein that contains a Zn2+-dependent RING motif (2Miki Y. et al.Science. 1994; 266: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (5304) Google Scholar). The functional importance of the RING domain is underscored by its high degree of sequence conservation among BRCA1 species and the existence of cancer-predisposing missense mutations that target Zn2+-liganding residues. The RING motif is characterized by a conserved pattern of seven cysteine and one histidine residues arranged in an interleaved fashion forming two distinct Zn2+-binding sites (termed Site I and Site II, Fig. 1) (3Borden K.L. B Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The key to structural characterization was the determination that the BRCA1 RING motif, which encompasses residues 24–64, is part of a larger domain (residues 1–109) that includes residues both N- and C-terminal to the core RING motif (4Brzovic P.S. Meza J. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7795-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This domain of BRCA1 preferentially forms a stable heterodimer complex with the RING domain of BARD1 (5Meza J.E. Brzovic P.S. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5659-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 6Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xie L.X. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), a protein that also binds to mRNA polyadenylation factor CtsF-50 to inhibit 3′ end processing of mRNA precursors (7Kleiman F.E. Manley J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 743-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). BRCA1 and BARD1 interact via an extensive anti-parallel 4-helix bundle interface formed by helices that flank the central RING motifs (Fig. 1). Although this arrangement positions the two central RING motifs of BRCA1 and BARD1 adjacent to each other, there are few direct interactions between them (8Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). BRCA1 and BARD1 have been shown to co-localize in vivo in a cell cycle-dependent manner and in response to DNA damage (9Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Linvingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). This association has received increased attention because recent studies have shown that the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer plays a functional role in facilitating ubiquitin transfer reactions (10Hasizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuke Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). A growing number of RING domains has been demonstrated to function as RING ubiquitin ligases that work in concert with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins (11Joazeiro C.A.P. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). By itself, the BRCA1 RING domain exhibits some activity as a RING E31 ubiquitin ligase (12Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). This activity increases dramatically upon formation of a BRCA1/BARD1 RING domain heterodimer (10Hasizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuke Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Cancer-predisposing mutations that target Zn2+-liganding residues abolish this activity. Undoubtedly, Zn2+ plays a critical role in stabilizing the BRCA1 RING domain, but the structural effects caused by mutation of Zn2+ ligands is not known. To investigate the consequences of cancer-predisposing mutations, we constructed a series of single-site mutations that alter Zn2+-liganding residues in Site II of the BRCA1 RING domain (Fig. 1). We found that Site II mutants not only fold and bind Zn2+ at Site I but also retain the ability to bind Zn2+ at Site II, albeit with reduced affinity. Furthermore, each of the BRCA1 mutants retain the ability to spontaneously form heterodimers with the RING domain of BARD1. Using limited proteolysis in conjunction with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that the structural effects of these BRCA1 Site II mutations are primarily localized to the second Zn2+ binding loop within the central RING motif of BRCA1, a region not involved in the BRCA1-BARD1 dimerization interface. Thus, BRCA1 Site II mutations cause a local structural perturbation and do not abolish one function of the BRCA1 RING domain, the ability to form a specific complex with BARD1. Instead, Site II cancer-predisposing mutations may alter a binding surface required for BRCA1 to interact with a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. 3,5-Dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid) and 2,2′:6′,2“ terpyridine were obtained from Aldrich and used without further purification. Limited proteolysis studies used sequencing grade endoproteinase Lys-C (Pierce). Bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, α-chymotrypsinogen, ribonuclease A, apo-equine myoglobin, and bovine insulin (as standards) were purchased from Sigma. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene. Wild-type BRCA1 and BARD1 N-terminal domain constructs were prepared as previously described (4Brzovic P.S. Meza J.

Single-site mutations were introduced into the wild-type BRCA1 plasmid using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. Expression, purification, and quantitation of wild-type and mutant BRCA1 and BARD1 constructs were as previously described (4Brzovic P.S. Meza J. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol.

Heterodimer samples purified by gel filtration chromatography in 25 mm Tris, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 7.6, were quantitated and used directly in limited proteolysis experiments. Proteolysis was performed under conditions designed to limit multiple cleavage events within a single polypeptide chain. Endoproteinase Lys-C was added to 8 µm heterodimer samples at a protein:protease ratio of either 4000:1 or 8000:1. These ratios were optimal for following the degradation and accumulation of protein fragments. Reaction aliquots (15 µl) were removed at 0, 3, 7, 15, 25, 45, 60, 90, and 130 min after the addition of protease, and the reaction was quenched by addition of 5 µl 3% trifluoroacetic acid solution. A saturated matrix solution was prepared by dissolving 35 mg of sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Matrix was mixed with sample in a ratio of 7:3 and spotted immediately on a MALDI sample plate in duplicate. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired and analyzed using a Bruker Daltronics Biflex-III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with delayed ion extraction. Identification of peptides resulting from proteolysis with Endo Lys-C was accomplished using the mass spectrometry analysis program PAWS (www.proteometrics.com). A cubic-spline base-line correction was applied to each spectra before the determination of peak intensities for all observable peptides. Proteolytic time courses were generated from the MALDI-TOF data by normalizing observed peak intensities. Peptide fragments were divided into two groups, either N-terminal or C-terminal peptides as shown in Table I. Normalized peak intensities were calculated by dividing the observed peak intensity for a peptide by the sum of all observed intensities for peaks within a group. Differentiating between N- and C-terminal peptides prevents a single cleavage event from being counted twice. Full-length BC-112 is considered to be either an N- or C-terminal peptide. Fragments ending at residue 109 were placed in the same group as the corresponding fragment terminating at residue 112.Table ICategorization of BRCA1 fragments observed during MALDI-TOF Wild-type and mutant heterodimer samples were prepared in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, by gel filtration chromatography. All samples were centrifuged before analysis. Nanospray ionization time-of-flight (ESI-TOF) spectra were acquired using a Mariner Biospectrometry work station (PerSeptive Biosystems) equipped with a syringe pump. Sample flow rate was between 0.5 and 1.0 µl/min. Spectra shown are the average of 25–100 scans/sample. Spectra were deconvoluted using the data explorer software provided with the system. Some of the most frequently reported cancer-predisposing missense mutations in BRCA1 target the Zn2+-liganding residues Cys-61 and Cys-64 within the second Zn2+-binding site (Site II) of the RING domain. To understand the structural consequences of these mutations in BRCA1, we constructed and purified BRCA1 Site II mutants in which each Zn2+-liganding residue (Cys-39, His-41, Cys-61, and Cys-64) was individually altered (TableII). As reported previously (4Brzovic P.S. Meza J. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7795-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Meza J.E. Brzovic P.S.

This behavior was demonstrated using gel filtration chromatography, fluorescence spectroscopy, and glutaraldehyde cross-linking techniques. We tested the ability of each BRCA1 Site II mutant to form heterodimers with BARD1 using the same experimental approaches. The elution profiles for all mutant BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimers constructs on an analytical gel-filtration column were essentially identical to the wild-type heterodimer complex (data not shown). Since gel filtration chromatography separates molecules based on their relative size, these results indicate that both wild-type and mutant species form well defined heterodimers with BARD1 with little predilection of the mutant complexes to form higher order aggregates at concentrations (µm) used in this work.Table IIList of BRCA1 and BARD1 constructsConstructProtein residues2-aEach construct has two extra residues at both the N-terminal (AS) and C-terminal (GK) ends, introduced as a result of the cloning procedures.MutationCalculated massBD-115BARD1 1–115None13121.1BC-112BRCA1 1–112None12960.3C39ABRCA1 1–112Cys-39 → Ala12928.3H41ABRCA1 1–112His-41 → Ala12894.3C61GBRCA1 1–112Cys-61 → Gly12914.2C61ABRCA1 1–112Cys-61 → Ala12928.3C64ABRCA1 1–112Cys-64 → Ala12928.32-a Each construct has two extra residues at both the N-terminal (AS) and C-terminal (GK) ends, introduced as a result of the cloning procedures. Open table in a new tab Fluorescence provides a useful means to follow BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer formation. The fluorescence spectrum of BD-115 (which contains two Trp residues, whereas BC-112 has none) undergoes a significant shift in emission wavelength and increase in fluorescence intensity upon heterodimer complex formation with BC-112 (5Meza J.E. Brzovic P.S. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5659-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Identical spectral shifts are observed for the complex with each of the BRCA1 Site II mutants and BARD1 (data not shown). The observation that the fluorescence spectrum of BARD1 is the same for each heterodimer complex suggests that the structure of BD-115 in the heterodimer, at least in the regions surrounding the tryptophan residues, is unaffected by mutations in the BRCA1 subunit of the heterodimer. Heterodimer formation between BRCA1 Site II mutants and BARD1 was also confirmed by glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments (data not shown). Introduction of BRCA1 Site II mutations has hampered detailed structural investigations as the concentrations required (∼mm) are difficult to obtain. Therefore, we used limited proteolysis in conjunction with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to investigate structural changes caused by BRCA1 Site II mutations. MALDI-TOF is particularly amenable to these studies given the ability of this technique to resolve and analyze mixtures of proteins and peptides from aqueous buffer solutions (14Cohen S.L. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Burley S.K. Chait B.T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1088-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For these studies, we relied primarily on the protease endoproteinase Lys-C based on the favorable distribution of lysine residues throughout the primary sequence of BRCA1 (Fig. 2E), although similar results are obtained using other proteases. Mass spectra collected on reaction samples quenched at various stages during limited proteolysis of wild-type and mutant BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimers are presented in Fig. 2. As shown for the wild-type complex, prior to addition of protease only full-length BRCA1 (BC-112) and BARD1 (BD-115) RING domain constructs are present (Fig.2A). Figs. 2, B–D, compare the proteolytic patterns observed for wild-type and mutant heterodimers 130 min after the addition of Endo Lys-C. The wild-type complex (Fig. 2B) is cleaved primarily at the extreme C-terminal ends of both the BRCA1 and BARD1 constructs to yield fragments of 109 (wt BC 1–109) and 105 (BD 1–105) residues in length, respectively. Although some minor cleavage is observed at residue 55 within BRCA1 to generate BC 1–55 and BC 56–109 fragments (right panel), BC 1–109 and BD 1–105 are relatively resistant to further proteolytic degradation and represent the extent of the BRCA1 and BARD1 N-terminal structural domains (5Meza J.E. Brzovic P.S. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5659-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The different BRCA1 Site II mutant heterodimers exhibit a variable degree of proteolytic susceptibility. Limited proteolysis of the H41A heterodimer gives a proteolytic profile that is essentially indistinguishable from that of the wild-type complex (data not shown), whereas the C39A, C61G, C61A, and C64A complexes display distinctly different proteolytic patterns (in our experiments the C61G, C61A, and C64A complexes yielded nearly identical patterns of proteolysis with Endo Lys-C; therefore, only the results observed with C64A are presented). The signal arising from the BC 1–55 fragment is substantially greater during proteolysis of the C39A, C61G, C61A, and C64A mutants relative to the wild-type complex. Secondly, alteration of individual cysteine residues in Site II unmasks cleavage sites at residues 65 and 70 in BRCA1 that are protected in the wild-type protein. These differences correspond to changes in proteolytic susceptibility within a 15-residue segment of BRCA1, a region within the second Zn2+ binding loop that includes the last pair of Zn2+-liganding residues that form Site II (see Fig.1). An additional fragment corresponding to cleavage at residue 38 is observed during proteolysis of the C39A mutant complex. Importantly, as is also observed for the wild-type heterodimer, no internal cleavage fragments of BARD1 are observed during proteolysis of any of the mutant heterodimer complexes. Thus, the BD 1–105 fragment rapidly accumulates in solution and remains resistant to further proteolytic degradation despite proteolysis within the BRCA1 subunit of the heterodimer. Although proteolysis of both the C39A and C64A (and C61G and C61A) heterodimers generates peptide fragments corresponding to cleavage at residues 55, 65, and 70 in the BRCA1 subunit, comparison of Figs.2, C and D, reveals that the intensity of signals arising from these fragments differs substantially. This reproducible pattern occurs despite the similarity of the mutations in which a Site II Cys Zn2+ ligand is replaced with Ala. Therefore, we sought to determine whether we could extend our analysis of limited proteolysis data to generate time courses from MALDI spectra and follow the accumulation and disappearance of species during the course of a reaction. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is not generally considered a quantitative technique. However, the reproducibility of our results and the similarity of all the proteins used in this study indicated that direct comparisons might be feasible (14Cohen S.L. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Burley S.K. Chait B.T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1088-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It was first necessary to establish how well the mass spectrometry data relate to well defined concentrations of reactants in solution. Fig.3A shows a plot of concentration versus intensity for a serial dilution of undigested wild-type heterodimer. Although the concentrations of BRCA1 and BARD1 in the heterodimer are equal, under our experimental conditions, the intensity of the peaks that correspond to the two polypeptides differ. However, the observed ratio of BARD1 to BRCA1 remains constant. Secondly, we reasoned that varying the concentration of protease should be reflected in the observed accumulation and degradation of species in the reaction mixture. This is demonstrated in the time courses for the conversion of BC-112 to BC 1–109 obtained for the wild-type heterodimer (Fig. 3B). Increasing the concentration of Endo Lys-C in the reaction mixture increases the observed rates for the disappearance of BC-112 and accumulation of BC-109. Similar responsiveness to protease concentration was observed for the disappearance and accumulation of all species monitored during proteolysis of both wild-type and mutant heterodimers (data not shown). Thus, by these criteria the technique is responsive to the relative concentration of peptides and reflects differences in the rates of formation and decay of species in solution. Time courses for N-terminal fragments observed during proteolysis of the wild-type and mutant BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer complexes with Endo Lys-C are shown in Fig. 4. As described above, wt BC-112 in the wild-type heterodimer is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage almost exclusively at the C-terminal end of the construct (Fig. 4A). As a result, wt BC 1–109 appears concomitantly with the disappearance of wt BC-112. The peptide wt BC 1–55 appears relatively late in the time course and with weak intensity. The reaction does not go to 100% completion probably due to loss of protease activity during the course of the reaction. Time courses generated from limited proteolysis of the H41A heterodimer are nearly indistinguishable from the wild-type profiles (data not shown). Fig. 4B shows time courses for fragments observed during the proteolytic digestion of the C39A heterodimer. In contrast to the wild-type reaction, loss of C39A BC-112 is accompanied by an accumulation of both C39A BC 1–109 and C39A BC 1–55 (generation of the BC 1–55 fragment can arise by cleavage of either BC 1–112 or BC 1–109). These data show that the BRCA1 subunit is rendered more susceptible to cleavage at residue 55 as a result of the C39A mutation. A fragment corresponding to residues BC 1–38 also accumulates in the reaction mixture (Figs. 2C, 4B). The slow, steady accumulation of C39A BC 1–38 relative to C39A BC 1–55 (Fig.4B) suggests this fragment represents a secondary cleavage event within the C39A BC 1–55 fragment rather than a primary cleavage event within either C39A BC 1–109 or 1–112. This is consistent with the absence of accumulation of a C39A BC 39–109 or 39–112 fragment in solution. BC 1–38 is only observed during proteolysis of the C39A mutant heterodimer, and the increased susceptibility at residue 38 is likely due to the mutation in the adjacent residue. Thus, the primary effect of the C39A mutation is increased proteolytic susceptibility at residue 55, relative to the wild-type complex. Inspection of Figs. 2, C and D, show that both the C39A and C64A heterodimers undergo proteolytic cleavage at residues 55, 65, and 70. However, examination of time courses for BC 1–55 and BC 71–112 (Figs. 5, A andB) reveal large differences in proteolytic susceptibility within this limited region of BRCA1. As shown in Fig. 5A, proteolysis at residue 55, which is only weakly susceptible in the wild-type heterodimer, readily occurs in both the C39A and C64A heterodimers, as shown by the rapid accumulation of the BC 1–55 fragment. Only modest differences are observed between the C64A and C39A BC 1–55 time courses. In marked contrast, the time course for C64A BC 71–112 C-terminal fragment reveals this species rapidly accumulates in solution immediately after the addition of protease, whereas there is a pronounced lag time of several minutes before detection of this species during proteolysis of the C39A heterodimer. In each case, the amount of the BC 71–112 fragment slowly declines as it is converted to BC 71–109, a limit peptide that cannot be further degraded. Close examination of Fig. 4C shows that fragments C64A BC 1–65 and C64A BC 1–70 also rapidly appear in solution after the addition of protease. These N-terminal peptides probably do not accumulate to significant levels relative to other species as they can be quickly degraded to C64A BC 1–55. These data show that the Cys-39 and Cys-64 mutations, both, result in increased proteolytic susceptibility at residue 55, whereas the C64A mutation (and C61A and C61G mutations, data not shown) results in increased susceptibility throughout the region of BRCA1 that includes residues 55, 65, and 70. Although the C39A, C61A, and C64A mutations each remove a cysteine ligand from Site II of BRCA1, the differences observed in the proteolytic profiles for these mutant complexes (Figs. 2, 4, and 5) prompted us to examine whether any of the mutant heterodimer species are still capable of binding Zn2+ at Site II. Procedures for collecting MALDI data, which include sample preparation in acidic matrix solutions and the process of laser desorption, disrupt most non-covalent and ionic interactions. Thus, MALDI spectra show only the individual peptide components. However, ESI of aqueous solutions at neutral pH may allow observation of non-covalent and ionic interactions, permitting characterization of protein tertiary and sometimes quaternary associations. This technique is particularly amenable to the study of Zn2+-protein complexes because metal-protein interactions are frequently preserved during ESI ionization (15Loo J.A. Mass. Spectrom. Rev. 1997; 16: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). ESI-TOF spectra for BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimers at neutral pH are shown in Fig. 6. Although each of the heterodimers is stable in solution under the experimental conditions (50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0) as judged by gel filtration chromatography (data not shown), the primary species observed is not the intact heterodimer complex but the separate BRCA1 and BARD1 subunits. However, as shown in Fig. 6A, the observed masses for the wild-type proteins correspond to the binding of two Zn2+ atoms per subunit, as expected for RING domains. With a mass of 65 a.m.u., the absence or presence of Zn2+is easily resolved. The presence of bound Zn2+ was verified by acidification of the sample with acetic acid (final solution pH < 4); lowering the pH denatures both the BRCA1 and BARD1 subunits with concomitant loss of bound Zn2+. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 6F for the C64A heterodimer complex. Under these solution conditions, the observed masses correspond to the proteins in the absence of Zn2+. Thus, information about protein-metal interactions are preserved in the ESI-TOF mass spectrometry experiment. The results for the mutant complexes are shown in Fig. 6,B-F. The H41A subunit is found exclusively in the two-Zn2+ form (data not shown), consistent with its similarity to the wild-type subunit in limited proteolysis experiments (see “Results”). Unexpectedly, a two-Zn2+species is also observed for both the C39A and C64A (and C61A) subunits. C39A (Fig. 6B) is almost exclusively in the two-Zn2+ form, whereas the C64A (Fig. 6C) and C61A (data not shown) subunits exist as a mixture of one-Zn2+ and two-Zn2+ species. All of the BRCA1 mutants bind at least one Zn2+ atom, almost certainly in Site I. This interpretation is consistent with our limited proteolysis studies (see “Results”) and reports of sequential metal binding to the BRCA1 RING domain with Site I of higher affinity (16Roehm P.C. Berg J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 33: 10240-12045Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In all cases the BARD1 subunit contains two bound Zn2+atoms. It is possible that the two-Zn2+ form observed for C64A represents a nonspecific protein-Zn2+ interaction. To test this, excess Zn2+ was added to each heterodimer samples. We did not observe Zn2+-protein complexes with a stoichiometry greater than two Zn2+ atoms/subunit, although large excess concentrations of Zn2+ eventually cause precipitation of the heterodimers. Interestingly, the addition of 40 µmZn2+ (0.5 eq/all Zn2+ sites) to the C64A heterodimer shifts C64A from a mixture of one-Zn2+ and two-Zn2+ species (Fig. 6C) to predominantly the two-Zn2+ form (Fig. 6D). Alternatively, the addition of EDTA, a metal chelating agent, yields primarily the one-Zn2+ species with nearly complete loss of the two-Zn2+ form (Fig. 6E). A small amount of the C64A subunit in the zero-Zn2+ form is also observed. The BARD1 subunit remains relatively unaffected by the addition of excess Zn2+ or EDTA. This is also true for both subunits of the wild-type heterodimer complex (data not shown). Thus, these experiments show that despite the loss of a metal ligand, the mutant heterodimers are still capable of binding Zn2+ at Site II of the BRCA1 subunit. The three-dimensional structure of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer complex (8Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) provides a framework for understanding the results of the limited proteolysis experiments (Fig. 7). BRCA1 and BARD1 interact by formation of an extensive 4-helix bundle formed by helices N- and C-terminal to the central RING motifs of both subunits. This arrangement juxtaposes the two central RING motifs next to each other, but there are few direct interactions between them. Residues that comprise Site II of BRCA1 are well removed from the dimerization interface. Thus, mutation of Site II Zn2+-liganding residues (i.e. Cys-39, Cys-61, or Cys-64) has a predominantly local structural effect that is reflected in the increased proteolytic susceptibility of the second Zn2+ binding loop of BRCA1. Other regions of the heterodimer are relatively unperturbed. Even excision of a 15-residue segment from the middle of the RING domain of BRCA1 (residues 56–70 in the C61A or C64A mutants) does not lead to perceptible dissociation of the heterodimer and further proteolytic degradation expected for the individual BRCA1 or BARD1 subunits (5Meza J.E. Brzovic P.S. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5659-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These results are indicative of the overall stability of the BARD1/BRCA1 heterodimer complex. The limited proteolysis studies revealed inherent differences between the various Site II mutants. Although H41A yields a protein that is indistinguishable from wild-type by our criteria, loss of a Site II cysteine ligand has a more pronounced effect that varies depending on the site of the mutation. The proteolytic susceptibility of the second Zn2+ loop is much more pronounced for the Cys-61 and Cys-64 mutants than for the C39A mutant (Figs. 2, 4, and 5). This difference is also reflected in the ESI-TOF data (Figs. 6, Band C). As the intrinsic binding affinity of individual thiolate ligands must be nearly identical, the overall protein structure must superimpose an important contextual effect. One clear distinction among the three Cys residues of Site II is the sequence context in which they are found. The ligands that comprise RING metal sites are arranged in pairs within the primary sequence (Fig. 1). Cys-39 is part of a Cys-X-His motif that constitutes the first pair of Site II ligands, and Cys-61 and Cys-64 are part of a Cys-X2-Cys motif that makes up the other half of the tetrahedral Zn2+-binding site. A prominent feature of the Cys-X2-Cys motif commonly observed in a number of Zn2+-binding proteins including the crystal structure of the RAG1 RING domain (17Bellon S.F. Rodgers K.K. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Steitz T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) is the presence of a hydrogen bond between the Sγ of the first Cys residue (i) and the backbone amide proton of the i+2 residue when the ligands are coordinated to Zn2+. NMR data suggest that this H-bonding pattern is present in the first and second Zn2+ binding loops of both BRCA1 and BARD1. 2P. S. Brzovic and R. E. Klevit, unpublished results. Thus, a Cys-X2-Cys motif may contribute more to the Zn2+ binding energy than a Cys-X-His due to enhanced structural stability afforded by its H-bonding capacity. Mutation of either Cys-61 or Cys-64 would not only alter the ability of the Cys-X2-Cys motif to bind Zn2+(Fig. 6C) but also disrupt this H-bonding interaction. It has been generally assumed that the cancer-predisposing mutations in Site II of BRCA1 yield a protein that is either misfolded or unfolded due to loss of Zn2+ binding at that site. This would surely disrupt the ability of the BRCA1 RING domain to form complexes with interacting proteins. We find instead that the Site II mutations cause local structural perturbations and do not abrogate the ability of the BRCA1 RING domain to interact with BARD1. This presents an apparent conflict with in vivo assays, which found that BRCA1 constructs encompassing the first 304 residues lost the ability to interact with BARD1, as judged by both two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays (6Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xie L.X. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). It is possible that the protein concentrations used for in vitro characterization (µm) mask biologically relevant alterations in the BRCA1/BARD1 dissociation constant (likely in the nm region) (5Meza J.E. Brzovic P.S. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5659-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the ability of Cys-61 or Cys-64 BRCA1 mutants to properly fold and bind BARD1 may be influenced by protein fusions required for two-hybrid analysis, the presence of regions outside the BRCA1 RING domain of unknown structural integrity, or aberrant interactions with other proteins present in the cellular milieu, all of which could lead to an apparent loss of function. In any case, thein vitro data demonstrate that the BRCA1 Site II mutants retain the requisite structural information for this domain to properly fold and dimerize with BARD1. If Site II mutations do not necessarily disrupt the interaction between BRCA1 and BARD1, are there other functional ramifications of mutations at Cys-39, Cys-61, and Cys-64 that predispose individuals to breast cancer? Recent studies show that the BRCA1 RING domain exhibits ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UbcH5) to protein targets (10Hasizume R.

Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5134-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Formation of a BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer greatly enhances this activity (10Hasizume R.

Although the original report utilized larger constructs of BRCA1 and BARD1, the wild-type heterodimer used in our studies behaves similarly in ubiquitination activity assays. 3P. S. Brzovic, R. E. Klevit, and T. Ohta, unpublished result. Of particular importance is the finding that mutations at Cys-39, Cys-61, and Cys-64 within Site II abolish the E3 activity of BRCA1 (10Hasizume R. Fukuda M.

Hemmati D. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5134-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It is likely that these mutations directly affect the BRCA1 RING(E3)-E2 binding interface. This postulate is based on the structure of another RING domain protein, cCbl, in complex with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7 (19Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffery P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). cCbl is a RING family E3 that promotes the ubiquitination of receptor tyrosine kinases. This activity is mediated via a direct interaction between the cCbl RING domain and an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Whereas the interface between BRCA1 and BARD1 is formed by helices that flank the central RING motif, the cCbl binding interface for UbcH7 is formed predominantly by the first Zn2+ loop, the central helix, and the second Zn2+ loop, regions that reside within the core RING motif of cCbl. The corresponding regions of BRCA1 are labeled in Fig. 7. It is the second Zn2+ loop, which forms a critical part of the RING(E3)-E2 interface of cCbl, that is perturbed by mutations within Site II of BRCA1. In addition to BARD1 and UbcH5c, the BRCA1 RING domain also interacts with BAP1, a de-ubiquitinating enzyme (13Jensen D.E. Proctor M. Marquis S.T. Gardner H.P. Ha S.I. Chodosh L.A. Ishov A.M. Tommerup N. Vissing H. Sekido Y. Minna J. Borodovsky A. Schultz D.C. Wilkinson K.D. Maul G.G. Barlev N. Berger S.L. Prendergast G.C. Raucher F.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined how BAP1 recognizes and binds to BRCA1, whether it interacts in a manner similar to BARD1 (8Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) or that proposed for UbcH5. The interplay of these proteins is consistent with important functions in protein regulation via ubiquitination. Accordingly, it has been suggested that missense mutations in the BRCA1 RING domain such as those described in Site II predispose to cancer by interfering with the ubiquitin-ligase activity of BRCA1 (10Hasizume R.

The relative amount of this population appears to depend on cellular growth and reaches its maximum during the stationary phase. The proportion of sigma(70)-retaining elongation complexes (EC-sigma(70)) is invariant with various promoters or distances from the transcription start site. EC-sigma(70) responds to pauses, intrinsic terminators, and the elongation factor NusA similarly to EC without sigma(70). However, EC-sigma(70) has a substantially higher ability to support multiple rounds of transcription at certain promoters, suggesting its profound role in gene expression and regulation in bacteria."

A comparable and highly conserved pattern of Aβ peptides, namely, 1–40/42 and carboxyl-terminal-truncated 1–37, 1–38, and 1–39, was found. Besides Aβ1–42, we also observed a consistent elevation of amino-terminal-truncated Aβ2–42 in a detergent-soluble pool in brains of subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Aβ2–42 was also specifically elevated in cerebrospinal fluid samples of Alzheimer's disease patients. To decipher the contribution of potential different γ-secretases (presenilins (PSs)) in generating the amino-terminal- and carboxyl-terminal-truncated Aβ peptides, we overexpressed β-amyloid precursor protein (APP)-trafficking mutants in PS1+/+ and PS1−/− neurons. As compared with APP-WT (primary neurons from control or PS1-deficient mice infected with Semliki Forest virus), PS1−/− neurons and PS1+/+ neurons overexpressing APP-Δct (a slow-internalizing mutant) show a decrease of all secreted Aβ peptide species, as expected, because this mutant is processed mainly by α-secretase. This drop is even more pronounced for the APP-KK construct (APP mutant carrying an endoplasmic reticulum retention motif). Surprisingly, Aβ2–42 is significantly less affected in PS1−/− neurons and in neurons transfected with the endocytosis-deficient APP-Δct construct.

The precise cleavage sites of the γ-secretase and hence the generation of the shorter or longer Aβ peptide are widely believed to have important pathological consequences. Disease-linked mutations in PS1, PS2, and APP result in an increase in production of Aβ1–42, which is the major component of the β-amyloid plaques deposited in the brains of AD patients (27Glenner G.G.

Mass spectroscopy has indicated the existence of additional Aβ peptide species besides Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 (41Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lee D. Keim P. Lieberburg I. Schenk D.B. J.

However, the absolute and relative quantities of these additional Aβ peptides are not known, nor has it been investigated whether they are regularly produced. We recently established one- and two-dimensional electrophoretic methods 2J. Wiltfang, H. Esselmann, M. Bibl, A. Smirnov, B. Schmidt, H. W. Klafki, M. Otto, M. Maler, T. Dyrks, M. Bienert, M.

Biochem. 1996; 237: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 45Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.W. Staufenbiel M. Huther G. Ruther E. Kornhuber J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) that are based on theN,N′-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-glycine/Tris urea separation gels of Wiltfang et al. (47Wiltfang J. Arold N. Neuhoff V. Electrophoresis. 1991; 12: 352-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The separation principle relies on conformational shifts of Aβ peptides in the presence of urea, which are specific for distinct Aβ peptide species (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, we observed a structure-function analogy in vivo and in vitro because the solubility of Aβ peptide species in vivo, e.g. increased aggregation of amino-terminal-truncated and carboxyl-terminal-elongated Aβ peptides, was closely and positively correlated with the electrophoretic mobility of Aβ peptide species in vitro. By using monoclonal antibody 1E8, which is specific for the first 2 amino acids of the Aβ peptide amino terminus (Fig. 1 A), we realized a detection sensitivity in the subpicogram range.2Here we combined immunoprecipitation (1E8) with the refined Aβ SDS-PAGE/immunoblot,2 which allowed us to study the secretion of Aβ peptides into the supernatants of neuronal cell cultures and a neuroglioma cell line. In addition, we studied the APP metabolite profile in brain homogenates and the CSF of patients with AD, patients with non-AD dementias (nADs), and patients with various nondementive neuropsychiatric diseases (ONDs). A comparable and highly conserved pattern of Aβ peptides, namely, Aβ1–40/Aβ1–42 and carboxyl-terminal-truncated Aβ1–37, Aβ1–38, and Aβ1–39, was found. Besides Aβ1–42, we also observed a striking and consistent elevation of amino-terminal-truncated Aβ2–42 in the brains of subjects with AD. Because Aβ2–42 was enriched in the detergent-soluble fraction of AD brain homogenates, it did not originate from β-amyloid plaque core. Aβ2–42 was also specifically elevated in CSF samples of AD patients. To decipher the contribution of potential different γ-secretases (presenilins) in generating the amino-terminal- and carboxyl-terminal-truncated Aβ peptides, we overexpressed APP-trafficking mutants in PS1+/+ and PS1−/− neurons. As compared with APP-WT (primary neurons from control or PS1-deficient mice infected with Semliki Forest virus), PS1−/− neurons and PS1+/+ neurons overexpressing APP-Δct (a slow-internalizing mutant) or APP-KK (APP mutant carrying an ER retention motif) show a decrease of all secreted Aβ peptide species. Surprisingly, Aβ2–42 is significantly less affected in PS1- and endocytosis-deficient (APP-Δct) neurons. Taken together, our results indicate that the amino-terminal-truncated and carboxyl-terminal-elongated Aβ2–42 was generated within a post-ER secretory pathway, where most of the Aβ2–42 is generated by a βAsp/Ala-secretase activity, possibly as alternative BACE activity. The data confirm that PS1 is an essential γ-secretase protein/cofactor responsible for the production of Aβ1–40/Aβ1–42 and the carboxyl-terminal-truncated Aβ1–37, Aβ1–38, and Aβ1–39, but not for the amino-terminal-truncated and carboxyl-terminal-elongated Aβ2–42. We investigated a total of 104 patients by Aβ SDS-PAGE/immunoblot. The dementia group included 51 patients with probable AD (average age, 70.9 ± 9.8 years) and 12 patients with dementia of other etiology (nAD group; average age, 53.9 ± 20.1 years). Moreover, we investigated 41 patients with various ONDs (average age, 42.5 ± 15.5 years). The patient groups nAD and OND can be summarized as neuropsychiatric disease controls (n = 53). Neuropsychiatric diagnosis was established by International Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD10) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) criteria (48American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 4th Ed. American Psychiatric Association, Washington, D. C.1994: 139-143Google Scholar). Patients with probable AD had to satisfy DSM-IV criteria for dementia of the Alzheimer's type and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA) criteria (49McKhann G. Drachman D. Folstein M. Katzman R. Price D. Stadlan E.M. Neurology. 1984; 34: 939-944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Brains were fixed in 10% formalin for at least 14 days for neuropathological studies. Representative blocks of cortex, cerebellum, and brainstem were cut and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections (4 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with Bielschowsky's silver impregnation methods. Immunohistochemistry was performed with monoclonal antibodies against β-amyloid (clone 6F/3D; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), phosphorylated tau (AT8; Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium), and α-synuclein (15G7; Connex, Munich, Germany) on paraffin-embedded sections (4 μm). Neuropathological diagnosis was performed using international criteria. AD-related pathology was classified using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) pathologic criteria based on semiquantitative analysis of neuritic plaques (Bielschowsky stain and βA4 immunostain) as well as the Braak and Braak classification based on the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads (Bielschowsky stain and AT8 immunostain) (50Braak H.

The number of LBs was counted in the brain regions determined in the protocol (α-synuclein immunostain) and converted into scores of A (no LBs), B (1–4 LBs), and C (>5 LBs) for each area. Based on the total score, dementia with LB cases were divided into three subtypes: brainstem dominant, limbic, and neocortical. Diagnosis of Pick disease and dementia lacking distinctive histopathology was made according to Cooper et al. (53Cooper P.N. Jackson M. Lennox G. Lowe J. Mann D.M. Arch. Neurol. 1995; 52: 1011-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Diagnosis of tangle predominant form of senile dementia was made according to Jellinger and Bancher (54Jellinger K.A.

Frozen brain tissue (frontal cortex and cerebellum) of the neuropathologically examined cases was used for immunoprecipitation with one- and two-dimensional Aβ SDS-PAGE/immunoblot. Generation of PS1 knockout mice has been described previously (16De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F.

Total brains were dissected and trypsinized. Cells were resuspended, plated on 95-cm2 tissue culture dishes (Nunc) precoated with 1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma), and finally incubated in minimum Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% horse serum medium (Perbio Sciences). After 4 h of culture, cells were incubated in neurobasal medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with the B27 complement mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 24 h before the addition of 5 μm cytosine arabinoside for inhibition of glial cell growth. A stably transfected H4 neuroglioma cell line expressing human mutant APP751swe (Swedish double mutation, K670N/M671L) was generously provided by T. Dyrks (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany). Cloning procedures, plasmid construction, transfection, and tissue culture were performed according to Urmoneit et al. (55Urmoneit B. Reinsch C. Turner J. Czech C. Beyreuther K. Dyrks T. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The cDNA coding for human APP695 and containing a Myc tag 3 amino acids after the signal sequence (inserted at the KpnI site) cloned in pSP65 was kindly provided by Drs. P. Tienari and K.

To obtain SFVs containing those sorting mutants, all constructs were moved to pSFV-1 vector (provided by Dr. C. Dotti, EMBL) and linearized with SpeI. mRNAs were produced using the SP6 polymerase run-off transcription, and a mixture of mRNA from APP constructs and from pSFV-helper were cotransfected in BHK cells by electroporation to obtain recombinant SFV. BHK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Perbio Sciences), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. The cell culture medium (7.5 ml) containing infective recombinant SFV was collected 24 h after transfection, spun at 3500 rpm for 15 min, aliquoted (500 μl), frozen directly in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until use. Each batch of virus preparation was analyzed for APP expression levels, and only batches that gave similar levels of expression were used in subsequent experiments. Mouse primary neuronal cultures were incubated in neurobasal medium containing SFV (100 μl of stock solution) expressing the pSFV-1 plasmid bearing APP-WT, APP-Δct, or APP-KK. After 1-h infection at 37 °C, cells were incubated in neurobasal medium without viruses for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were then metabolically labeled for 4 h at 37 °C by incubation in methionine-free minimum Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with the B27 complement mixture and containing 200 μCi of [35S]methionine (ICN). At the end of the incubation, culture media were recovered, and cells were washed once with PBS and finally lysed in DIP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). Cell extracts and media were spun for 10 min at 14,000 rpm in a microfuge (Eppendorf) to remove DNA and cell debris. Cells extracts and cell media (supernatants) were immunoprecipitated by mixing them with 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose and with an antibody against the APP ectodomain (diluted 200-fold; generously given by Dr. Greenberg, Cephalon Inc.). After an overnight incubation on a rotating wheel at 4 °C, immunoprecipitates were washed four times with DIP buffer and washed once with PBS/water (1:3). Samples were finally solubilized in 25 μl of Tris-tricine sample buffer (450 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.45, 12% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.0025% Coomassie Blue G, and 0.0025% phenol red) and boiled for 10 min before loading on gel. SDS-PAGE was performed on precasted 10–20% acrylamide Tris-tricine gels (Novex). At the end of the run, gels were fixed in methanol/water (1:1) for 2 h at room temperature and dried (Bio-Rad, type 583). Radiolabeled material was detected using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and quantification was performed by ImagQuaNT 4.1. After obtaining informed consent from patients and/or family members, CSF (3–10 ml) was drawn by lumbar puncture from patients and sampled in polypropylene vials. After centrifugation (1000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), CSF samples were processed within 12 h, and aliquots of 150 μl were stored at −80 °C for subsequent one- and two-dimensional Aβ SDS-PAGE/immunoblot. Cell culture media were removed after 24 h of incubation and analyzed by immunoprecipitation for Aβ peptides. For immunoprecipitation, 400 μl of media were added to 100 μl of 5-fold concentrated RIPA detergent buffer (5× RIPA = 2.5% Nonidet P-40, 1.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.25% SDS, 750 mm NaCl, 250 mmHEPES, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture CompleteTM Mini per 2 ml of 5× RIPA, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH) and 25 μl of magnetic microparticles (DynaBeads, Dynal, Germany) coated with monoclonal antibody 1E8 (1 μg of mAb 1E8/1.68 × 107 beads). The protease inhibitor mixture CompleteTM Mini was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and mAb 1E8 was provided by T. Dyrks. Samples were incubated under rotation for 15 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with PBS/0.1% bovine serum albumin and one time with 10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4.

In contrast, mice lacking the murine homologue Nkx2–5 are defective in cardiac looping but not in cardiac myocyte development. The lack of an essential role for Nkx2–5 in cardiomyogenesis in mammalian systems is most likely the result of genetic redundancy with family members. In this study, we used a dominant negative mutant of Nkx2–5, created by fusing the repressor domain of engrailed 2 to the Nkx2–5 homeodomain, termed Nkx/EnR. Expression of Nkx/EnR inhibited Me2SO-induced cardiomyogenesis in P19 cells but not skeletal myogenesis. Nkx/EnR inhibited expression of cardiomyoblast markers, such as GATA-4 and MEF2C, but not of mesoderm markers, such as Brachyury T and Wnt5b, or of skeletal lineage markers, such as MyoD and Mox1. To identify the minimal region of Nkx2–5 that can trigger cardiomyogenesis, we analyzed the activity of various Nkx2–5 deletion mutants. The C-terminal domain was not necessary for the ability of Nkx2–5 to induce cardiomyogenesis and loss of this domain did not enhance myogenesis. Therefore, Nkx2–5 function is essential for commitment of mesoderm into the cardiac muscle lineage, and the N-terminal region, together with the homeodomain, is sufficient for cardiomyogenesis in P19 cells.

In the fruit fly, tinman is expressed in the early mesoderm and the dorsal vessel and is essential for dorsal vessel formation (1Bodmer R. Development. 1993; 118: 719-729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Azpiazu N. Frasch M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1325-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). A vertebrate homologue of tinman, Nkx2–5 or Csx, is initially present in cardiac progenitors and the pharyngeal endoderm, as early as 7.5 days postcoitum (3Lints T.J. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P. Development. 1993; 119: 419-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for a null mutation in Nkx2–5 still form the heart tube and express most cardiac-specific genes (4Lyons I. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Li R. Andrews J.E. Robb L. Harvey R.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1654-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 5Biben C. Harvey R.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 6Zou Y.M. Evans S. Chen J. Kuo H.C. Harvey R.P. Chien K.R. Development. 1997; 124: 793-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The heart tube bends correctly but fails to undergo complete looping, possibly as a result of abnormal muscle growth. The finding that Nkx2–5 is not essential for the formation of cardiomyocytes in mice, but is essential in Drosophila, may be attributed to an overlapping of function between the family of Nkx2–5-related genes in vertebrates (7Newman C.S. Krieg P.A. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because characterization of the role of Nkx2–5 in vertebrate early heart formation has been complicated by a potential functional redundancy of the Nkx homologues, single knockouts have not been completely informative. To circumvent this problem, the genetic redundancy of Nkx and its requirement for cardiac specification and determination were investigated in a novel approach using dominantly acting repressor constructs specific for chosen Nkx homologues (8Fu Y. Yan W. Mohun T.J. Evans S.M. Development. 1998; 125: 4439-4449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Grow M.W. Krieg P.A. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These dominant repressors were made by fusion of the active repressor domain of the Drosophila engrailed homeodomain protein to the homeodomain of Xenopus Nkx family members (10Badiani P. Corbella P. Kioussis D. Marvel J. Weston K. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 770-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11Han K. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2723-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In this way, co-ectopic expression of the chimeric constructs for both XNkx2–3 and XNkx2–5 in developing Xenopus embryos was shown to be synergistic in completely blocking heart formation and cardiac gene expression such as XNkx2–5, Xenopus cardiac troponin I, and XMLC2. Therefore, these genes are required for the earliest stages of cardiac development in a functionally redundant manner. Nkx2–5 functions as a modest transcriptional activator in fibroblasts with promoters carrying multimerized NKE binding sites (12Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15628-15633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 13Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Optimal Nkx2–5 activity requires physical interactions with other cardiac-restricted factors, such as GATA-4 (13Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 14Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell.

Jobe S.M. Wiese R.J. Markham B.E. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3120-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and serum response factor (17Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the GATA factors may also antagonize Nkx2–5 transcription, restricting the domain of Nkx2–5 expression within the heart field (18Jiang Y. Drysdale T.A. Evans T. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, the MADS-box containing MEF2 proteins can interact and synergize with GATA factors, similar to the cooperative interaction between MEF2 proteins and the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix factors in skeletal muscle (19Morin S. Charron F. Robitaille L. Nemer M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Detailed structure/function studies have been performed on Nkx2–5 using transient transfection assays. In the homeodomain region, an amino acid substitution from a conserved asparagine to a glutamine at position 52 in helix 3 blocked DNA binding and reporter gene activation, demonstrating the importance of the homeodomain in binding specificity. Immediately N-terminal to the homeodomain is a putative activation domain, a region of high charge density with overlapping alanine- and proline-rich sequences. This domain appears to be masked by a C-terminal inhibitory region rich in alanine and proline (12Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15628-15633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 13Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Deletion of the C-terminal region domain causes a 50–300-fold enhancement of Nkx2–5 function, resulting in activity that is similar in strength to wild type Nkx2–5 in the presence of GATA-4. Consequently it has been proposed that the binding of GATA-4 to the homeodomain changes the protein conformation and relieves the inhibition by the C terminus. Embryonal carcinoma cells, such as the P19 cell line, are an attractive alternative to the embryo in the identification and analysis of components and events that comprise cardiomyogenesis. P19 cells are capable of differentiating into a variety of cell types representative of all three germ layers. Cellular aggregation in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) results in the development of cardiac muscle by day 6 of differentiation, whereas the development of skeletal muscle is not observed until day 9 of differentiation. On day 6 of differentiation, markers found in cardiac muscle, such as GATA-4, MEF2C, and cardiac α-actin, are observed, whereas skeletal muscle-specific markers, such as MyoD and myogenin, are absent. By day 9, markers for both cardiac and skeletal muscle are present (for review, see Ref. 20Skerjanc I.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The cardiac myocytes derived from P19 cells display the biochemical and physiological properties that occur during early embryonic development (21McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M. Edwards M.K. Anderson P.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 22McBurney M.W. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 37: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 19-49Google Scholar). Aggregated P19 cells provide the only environment identified to date that will support the induction of cardiomyogenesis by Nkx2–5, MEF2C, or GATA-4 (24Grepin C. Nemer G. Nemer M. Development. 1997; 124: 2387-2395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Skerjanc I.S. Petropoulos H. Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34904-34910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used a dominant negative approach to determine whether Nkx2–5 function is essential for cardiomyogenesis in P19 cells. Expression of the dominant negative Nkx2–5 protein completely abolished cardiomyogenesis but not skeletal myogenesis. Furthermore, the N-terminal domain and homeodomain define the minimal region of Nkx2–5 necessary for its function in P19 cells. Nkx2–5 full-length (Nkx2–5) cDNA was kindly provided by R. Harvey. The Nkx2–5 deletion mutants were constructed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)1 amplification with appropriate primers corresponding to the fragment end points. The cDNA fragment NkxΔN was constructed by PCR of the homeodomain and the C-terminal domain (aa 137–319) using the 5′-oligonucleotide (oligo) P7 (5′-CGC CAC CAT GCG ACG GAA GCC ACG CGT GCT CTT C-3′) and the 3′-oligo P8 (5′-ggatcc CTA CCA GGC ACG GAT GCC GTG CAG C-3′). The cDNA fragment NkxHD was constructed by PCR of the homeodomain (aa 137–197) using the 5′-oligo P7 and the 3′-oligo P6 (5′-ggatcc CTA CCG CTG TCG CTT GCA CTT GTA GCG-3′). The cDNA fragment NkxΔC contained the N-terminal domain and homeodomain of Nkx2–5 (aa 1–197) and was PCR-amplified using the 5′-oligo P5 (5′-C gagctc GCG CTG TGA AAC CTG CGT CGC CAC C-3′) and the 3′-oligo P6. Each of the deletion products (except those primed with P7) were designed to contain flanking SstI and BamHI (indicated above in lowercase) restriction enzyme sites to facilitate directional cloning into those two sites in the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) vector multiple cloning site. The DNA construct Nkx/EnR contains the 768-bp EN2-Nkx2–5HD fusion cDNA. The 196-aa N-terminal repression domain of the mouse engrailed-2 (EN2) protein was fused to the N terminus of the 60-aa Nkx2–5 homeodomain by PCR of EN2 using the 5′-oligo (5′-G gagctc GCC ACC ATG GAG GAG AAG GAT TCC-3′) and the 3′-oligo (5′-G ctcgag GGC TTT CTT GAT TTT GGC CCG CTT G-3′). Both SstI- and XhoI-flanking sites were engineered into the EN2 product to facilitate in-frame fusion with the homeodomain. All PCR reactions were performed using Qiagen Taq DNA polymerase using Q-Solution under the following conditions: initial cycle 6 min in duration at 94 °C; 25 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 55 °C, and extension for 1 min at 72 °C; and a final cycle for 6 min at 72 °C. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing (Robarts Research Institute Sequencing Facility) using a primer to the PGK promoter and the appropriate antisense primer crossing the putative deletion region. All expression vectors utilized the pgk-1 promoter to drive the expression of various cDNAs. The construct PGK-lacZ contains the gene encoding β-galactosidase, the construct PGK-puro contains the gene encoding puromycin resistance (26Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and B17 is a 17-kb BamHI fragment of the pgk-1 promoter (27McBurney M.W. Fournier S. Jardine K. Sutherland L. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 515-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). P19 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-1825) and were cultured in α-minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% (v/v) Cosmic Calf Serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (CanSera, Rexdale, Ontario, Canada) and 100 μg/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were plated at a density of 1×105 cells/ml of medium and subcultured every 2 days. Stable P19 cell lines expressing various cDNAs (P19[Nkx/EnR], P19[Nkx2–5], P19[NkxΔN], P19[NkxHD], and P19[NkxΔC]) were generated using either the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (28Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar) or FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were seeded at 0.75 × 106 cells in 5 ml of medium in a 60-mm culture dish 24 h before transfection. For each calcium phosphate cotransfection, a total of 12.5 μg of plasmid was used: 1 μg of PGK-lacZ, 1 μg of PGK-puro, 2.5 μg of B17, and 8 μg of the desired expression plasmid. After 9 h of transfection, the dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 24 h in growth medium before harvest. For each FuGENE 6 transfection, a total of 9 μg of plasmid was used: 0.5 μg of PGK-lacZ, 0.5 μg of PGK-puro, 2 μg of B17, and 6 μg of the desired expression plasmid. For P19 transfections using FuGENE 6 reagent, the optimal reagent (μl) to DNA (μg) ratio has been determined to be 6:3 for high transfection efficiencies. Transfected cells were harvested in 0.25 m Tris, pH 7.8, and β-galactosidase reporter gene assays performed to ensure high transfection efficiencies. The cells were then plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/150-mm culture dish and grown in medium under the selection of puromycin (2 μg/ml). Several high expressing clones were selected and transferred to 100-mm culture dishes. Once confluent, 1 × 106 cells were plated for a “day zero” harvest 48 h later, and 0.5 × 106 cells were plated for differentiation. Differentiation was induced as described previously (29Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) by aggregating 0.5 × 106 cells in 60-mm bacterial dishes with or without 0.8% Me2SO. The presence of Me2SO during the aggregation initiates cardiomyogenesis and cardiac muscle is observed after 6 days of culture, in the appropriate serum (30Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1999; 35: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Control cell lines aggregated in the absence of Me2SO did not undergo cardiomyogenesis. After 4 days of aggregation, cells were plated in 150-mm culture dishes and harvested for RNA on day 6, 2 days later. Cells were also plated onto 0.1% (w/v) gelatin-coated coverslips and fixed for immunofluorescence on day 6. To determine the hierarchy of gene expression in the Nkx2–5 cardiac pathway, an aggregation time course was carried out in the presence of 0.8% Me2SO with two of the P19[Nkx/EnR] cell lines isolated and P19[control] cells. Northern blots were performed as described previously (31Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from day 0 and day 6 P19 cell lines and control cells by the lithium chloride/urea extraction method (32Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). Separation of total RNA (6 μg) was performed on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel by electrophoresis at 24 V overnight. After RNA was transferred to Hybond-N (Amersham Canada, Ltd., Oakville, Canada) by capillary blotting overnight, it was cross-linked by UV irradiation. Hybridization was performed with DNA probes labeled to over 109 cpm/μg with [α-32P]dCTP using a Multiprime labeling kit (Amersham Canada, Ltd.). The probes were purified on a G-50 Sephadex spin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d’Urfé, Quebec, Canada), denatured by boiling, and then cooled on ice before use. After the blots were prehybridized for 3–4 h, they were hybridized to the labeled probe for 16 h at 42 °C in either NorthernMax (Ambion) or a standard hybridization buffer (5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt’s solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 50% deionized formamide). Blots were subsequently washed for 5×5 min at 42 °C in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and for 15 min at 65 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Hybridization was visualized by autoradiography and with a PhosphorImager SI from Molecular Dynamics. The probes used were: a 600-bp PstI fragment from the human cardiac α-actin last exon (33Rudnicki M.A. Jackowski G. Saggin L. McBurney M.W. Dev.

After a 5-min fixation in methanol at −20 °C, cells were rehydrated in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of 50 μl of a mouse anti-myosin heavy chain (MyHC) monoclonal antibody supernatant, MF20, in a humidified chamber (42Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19033-19039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). After three 5-min PBS washes, cells were similarly incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark in 50 μl of PBS with 1 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) Cy3-linked antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). After the cells were washed with PBS, coverslips were mounted in a solution of 50% glycerol, 40% PBS, 9.9% paraphenylene diamine, and 0.1% Hoechst stain onto glass slides. Immunofluorescence was visualized with a Zeiss Axioscope microscope; images were captured with a Sony 3CCD color video camera and processed using Northern Eclipse, Adobe Photoshop 5.5 and Canvas 7 (Deneba) software. Immunofluorescence experiments were carried out in duplicate. Because Nkx2–5 is sufficient to induce cardiomyogenesis in aggregated P19 cells (25Skerjanc I.S. Petropoulos H. Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34904-34910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we investigated whether it is also essential for early cardiomyogenesis by constructing a dominantly acting repressor protein. Previous studies have shown that Nkx2–5 is required for heart formation in Xenopus by using chimeric dominant repressors consisting of the Drosophila engrailed homeoprotein fused to the Nkx2–5 homeodomain (8Fu Y. Yan W. Mohun T.J. Evans S.M. Development. 1998; 125: 4439-4449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To create this dominant negative Nkx2–5 for our study, the active repression domain of mouse engrailed-2 was fused in-frame to the DNA-binding homeodomain region of mouse Nkx2–5 (Fig. 1, panel I), termed Nkx/EnR. To test whether the chimeric construct could act to dominantly repress transcription from Nkx2–5 target promoter sites, we stably expressed Nkx/EnR in P19 cells and independently isolated two P19[Nkx/EnR] cell lines. P19[control] and P19[Nkx/EnR] cells were differentiated for 6 and 9 days in the presence of Me2SO to induce endogenous cardiomyogenesis and skeletal myogenesis, respectively. Cultures were stained by immunofluorescence with the anti-MyHC antibody, MF20, which reacts with both cardiac and skeletal muscle. Cardiac and skeletal muscle exhibit distinct morphologies. Cardiomyocytes appear rounded and exhibit extensive cell-cell contacts, whereas skeletal myocytes are bipolar and mononucleate. Cardiac and skeletal myocytes are rarely found in the same field of view under the microscope. P19[control] cells efficiently differentiated into MyHC-positive cardiomyocytes and bipolar skeletal myocytes by day 6 (Fig. 1, panel II,F) and day 9 (Fig. 1, panel II, H), respectively. P19[Nkx/EnR] cell lines aggregated under identical conditions did not differentiate into cardiomyocytes on day 6 (Fig. 1,panel II, B) but did differentiate into bipolar skeletal myocytes on day 9 (Fig. 1, panel II, D). Therefore, Nkx2–5 function appears essential for cardiomyogenesis but not skeletal myogenesis in P19 cells. As a control, the engrailed-2 repressor domain was expressed stably in P19 cells, without fusion to any DNA binding domain. P19[EnR] cells differentiated efficiently into both cardiac and skeletal muscle, indicated by the formation of MyHC-positive muscle and the presence of the cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific transcripts, respectively (data not shown). To identify which cardiac-specific transcripts are regulated by Nkx2–5, Northern blots were examined. The expression profiles of two P19[Nkx/EnR] cell lines were compared with a P19[control] cell line (Fig. 2). Total RNA was isolated on days 0 and 6 of differentiation in the presence of Me2SO and subjected to Northern blot analysis. High levels of the transfected Nkx/EnR fusion construct were present on both day 0 and day 6 in P19[Nkx/EnR] cultures (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–4) but not in P19 control cultures (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and 6). The lack of cardiac muscle in P19[Nkx/EnR] cultures in comparison to control cultures was demonstrated by the lack of cardiac α-actin expression on day 6 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2and 4 compared with lane 6). To determine whether P19[Nkx/EnR] cultures contained cardiomyoblasts, the expression levels of GATA-4 and MEF2C were examined. GATA-4 and MEF2C transcript levels were absent in P19[Nkx/EnR] cultures on day 6 (Fig. 2, C and D, respectively; lanes 2 and 4) when compared with P19[control] cultures (Fig. 2, C and D, respectively; lane 6). Consequently, Nkx/EnR expression resulted in the inhibition of cardiomyoblast formation, as indicated by the loss of GATA-4 and MEF2C transcripts. To confirm the result shown by immunofluorescence experiments that skeletal myogenesis proceeded efficiently in P19[Nkx/EnR] cultures, the expression levels of the myogenic regulatory factors, MyoD and myogenin, were examined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3). On day 9 of differentiation, both P19[control] and P19[Nkx/EnR] cultures expressed MyoD and myogenin. Enhanced levels of myogenin were occasionally seen in P19[Nkx/EnR] cultures compared with P19[control] cultures, but this was not consistent. MyoD and myogenin transcripts were not observed in cultures prior to day 7 (data not shown). To determine the earliest stage that loss of gene expression could be detected in P19[Nkx/EnR] cultures, a time course was examined during P19[Nkx/EnR] and P19[control] cell differentiation from day 0 to day 4 in the presence of Me2SO. High levels of the transfected Nkx/EnR fusion construct were present in P19[Nkx/EnR] cultures but not in P19 control cultures (Fig. 4 A). The cardiomyoblast marker GATA-4 was expressed by day 2 in P19[control] cells but was not present at any time in P19[Nkx/EnR] cultures (Fig. 4 B). The expression of BMP4 was examined because BMP4 plays an integral role in early cardiomyogenesis and tissue that expresses BMP4 is in contact with pre-cardiac cells (43Schultheiss T.M. Burch J.B. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 44Monzen K. Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Akazawa H. Oka T. Takimoto E. Hayashi D. Hosoda T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ishii S. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). BMP4 expression was greatly reduced in P19[Nkx/EnR] cultures. Although BMP4 was present initially on day 4 in control cells, it was not observed at this time point in P19[Nkx/EnR] cultures (Fig. 4 C). BMP4 transcripts were present on day 6 in P19[Nkx/EnR] cultures ∼8-fold lower than in control cells (data not shown). Several factors are present during early P19 cell differentiation and in the primitive streak of the developing embryo, including Brachyury T, Wnt3a, and Wnt5b (31Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H.

The expression of these genes was relatively unaffected in P19[Nkx/EnR] cells compared with control cell lines (Fig. 4, D–F, respectively), indicating that mesoderm induction occurred normally. Furthermore, genes involved in commitment to the skeletal muscle lineage were examined. Expression of genes for Mox1 and Pax3 was not lost in P19[Nkx/EnR] cultures compared with control cultures (Fig. 4, G and H, respectively). Therefore, mesoderm induction and skeletal myogenesis were unaffected by the presence of Nkx/EnR. Previous studies have shown that Nkx2–5 can induce cardiomyogenesis in aggregated P19 cells (25Skerjanc I.S. Petropoulos H. Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34904-34910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Nkx2–5 mutants have been analyzed for their ability to transactivate exogenous promoters in transient transfection assays (13Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M.

However, a dissection of Nkx2–5 functional domains has not been performed on endogenous promoters. In an effort to identify the minimal region of Nkx2–5 that can activate endogenous cardiac muscle-specific gene expression, we analyzed the functional domains of Nkx2–5 in terms of their activity in P19 cells. PCR amplification was carried out on full-length Nkx2–5 to delete the N terminus, the C"

To evaluate the significance of epigenetic rather than genetic lesions in medulloblastomas and other primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) of the childhood CNS we performed a systematic analysis of gene specific and global methylation. Methylation-specific PCR detected no methylation for p15(INK4B), von Hippel Lindau and TP53 and only limited methylation for E-Cadherin and p16(INK4A) in tumors. The cell lines Daoy and MHH-PNET-5 in which the p16(INK4A) promoter was methylated did not express the gene, but demonstrated abnormalities by SSCP. Immunohistochemistry for p16 was negative in all examined normal cerebella and medulloblastomas. Using the technique of Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning we detected methylation affecting up to 1% of all CpG islands in primary MB/PNETs and 6% in MB cell lines. Methylation patterns differed between medulloblastomas and PNETs. Examination of several methylated sequences revealed homologies to known genes and expressed sequences. Analysis of survival data identified seven of 30 hypermethylated sequences significantly correlating with poor prognosis. We suggest that DNA hypermethylation has an outstanding potential for the identification of novel tumor suppressors as well as diagnostic and therapeutic targets in MBs and other PNETs of the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2006943116,"Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in organ development, synaptogenesis, and response to hypoxia in Drosophila. We cloned and analyzed the only gene in the fly genome that encodes Drosophila nitric-oxide synthase (dNOS). It consists of 19 exons and is dispersed over 34 kilobases of genomic DNA. Alternative transcription start sites and alternative splice sites are used to generate a remarkable variety of mRNAs from the dNOS gene. We identified eight new transcripts that are widely expressed throughout Drosophiladevelopment and encode a family of DNOS-related proteins. Alternative splicing affects both the 5′-untranslated region and the coding region of the dNOS primary transcript. Most of the splicing alterations in the coding region of the gene lead to premature termination of the open reading frame. As a result, none of the alternative transcripts encode an enzymatically active protein. However, some of these shorter DNOS protein products can effectively inhibit enzymatic activity of the full-length DNOS1 protein when co-expressed in mammalian cells, thus acting as dominant negative regulators of NO synthesis. Using immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that these short DNOS protein isoforms can form heterodimers with DNOS1, pointing to a physical basis for the dominant negative effect.

It is produced by a family of nitric-oxide synthases (NOS), which are encoded by three distinct genes in the mammalian genome. These genes are expressed throughout development as well as in the adult animal. Their transcriptional regulation is highly complex; a range of alternative promoters, splice sites, and polyadenylation signals is used to generate families of transcripts and proteins from each chromosomal gene (see Refs. 2Wang Y.

In Drosophila NO has been shown to be involved in imaginal disc development, synaptogenesis, formation of retinal projection pattern, response to hypoxia, and behavioral responses (see Ref. 5Enikolopov G. Banerji J. Kuzin B. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar for review). The gene for Drosophila NO synthase,dNOS, is located on the second chromosome at cytological position 32B (6Regulski M. Tully T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The major product of the gene, dNOS1, encodes a protein that bears a strong resemblance to all three NOS isoforms of mammals, with the highest homology to neuronal NOS (nNOS) (6Regulski M. Tully T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Several attempts to clone putative orthologs of mammalian endothelial or inducible forms of NOS (eNOS or iNOS) from various Drosophila cDNA or genomic libraries have not revealed any other NOS loci in the fruit fly's genome. 2Y. Stasiv, M. Regulski, and G. Enikolopov, unpublished information.2Y. Stasiv, M. Regulski, and G. Enikolopov, unpublished information. The recently released complete sequence of the Drosophila genome (7Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4744) Google Scholar) has further confirmed our conclusion that the dNOS locus represents the only gene for NO synthase in Drosophila. To explore the role of NO in fruit fly physiology and development, we sought to determine the structure of the Drosophila NOS gene to search for alternative transcripts and proteins and to investigate the role of possible DNOS isoform diversity in NO signaling. This paper analyzes the Drosophila NOS locus and identifies multiple transcripts that code for a family of DNOS proteins. dNOSmRNA isoforms are expressed throughout Drosophiladevelopment. We have found that some of these mRNAs encode truncated DNOS polypeptides, and we have gone on to show that these truncated DNOS proteins can form heterodimers with the full-length DNOS1 and strongly inhibit its enzymatic activity when co-expressed in cultured cells. Together, our observations suggest that the diversity of products encoded by the dNOS gene may have a direct impact on NOS activity and NO signaling in Drosophila. A Drosophila λDASH genomic library (5 × 104 plaques) was screened with probes corresponding to different regions of the dNOS1 cDNA (6Regulski M. Tully T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The four longest overlapping phage clones covering the entire dNOSgene were isolated and mapped using HindIII and EcoRI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs). Restriction fragments were subcloned into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) and sequenced by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory DNA sequencing facility. Phage purification, hybridization, and cloning steps were performed using the standard methods (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Drosophila embryos from 0 to 24 h after fertilization were collected together as described previously (9Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), dechorionated with 50% bleach, and subjected to total RNA isolation using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). Larvae enriched in 3rd instar were collected essentially as described (9Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA from larvae and adult flies was isolated with TRIzol. RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to remove traces of genomic DNA. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using oligo(dT)-cellulose columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 5′-untranslated exons of the dNOSgene were identified by the 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) technique (10Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The first strand of cDNA was synthesized by murine leukemia virus RT (Applied Biosystems) using an exon 2-specific antisense oligonucleotide 5′-AATATCGATGTGAAATGCTGCGACATC-3′ and 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from Drosophilalarvae. cDNA was polyguanylated at the 3′-end using terminal transferase (Promega). The 5′ regions of different transcripts were amplified by PCR using Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems), a poly(dC) sense oligonucleotide (5′-AGCTGGATCCCCCCCCCCCCC-3′) and an antisense oligonucleotide 5′-TTTCTGCGGCTCTCTTTTTCGG-3′ from exon 2 of the dNOS gene. PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. To increase the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR experiments, two rounds of amplification were usually performed. The initial PCR of 30–35 cycles using one pair of primers (first round) was followed by a subsequent amplification of a 1-μl aliquot from the first round for additional 20–25 cycles (second round) using another pair of primers (nested), which were located within the initial (first round) amplicon. To eliminate false positive amplification products, negative (RT minus) controls were amplified by PCR together with the experimental (RT plus) samples. In addition, before subcloning, all RT-PCR and PCR products were size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis and capillary transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After transfer, the membranes were hybridized with γ-[32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the amplified regions. The following sense oligonucleotides from the very 5′-ends of novel dNOS exons were used with the antisense primers from exon 2 (as above) in RT-PCR experiments to confirm the 5′-RACE data: 5′-CTGTCTCTCTATTGTATACCTG-3′ and 5′-CGAACTACAACTGCAACGAG-3′ (nested) for exon 1a; 5′-TCAACGCGCGGCGTTCGAGTTCTTT-3′ and 5′-GTCAGTGAAGTGACCGAAAGAAG-3′ (nested) for exon 1b; and 5′-TGACGAATCGCGGGAGCTTT-3′ and 5′-TCAACGCGCGGCGTTCGAGTTCTTT-3′ (nested) for exon 1c. The dNOS3 cDNA was isolated using PCR-based screening (11Israel D.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) of a Drosophila 5′-STRETCH larval cDNA library in the bacteriophage vector λgt10 (CLONTECH). The PCR amplicon for this screen extended from exon 2 (sense primer 5′-GAACCTGCGATTCGTGAC-3′) to exon 5 (antisense primer 5′-GTTTCCATCGCGTCTCGTG-3′). Three positive clones were isolated and sequenced. The dNOS4 transcript was found after RT-PCR of a total RNA from larvae using a pair of oligonucleotides from exons 13 (sense, 5′-CACCTTTGGCAACGGTGA-3′) and 15 (antisense, 5′-CGAAGGCGCAGAAATTTGG-3′). Two additional alternatively spliced transcripts, dNOS5 and dNOS6, were identified by RT-PCR using primers specific to exons 12 (sense, 5′-GGCAAATCGGAGCAGTATGC3-′) and 14a (antisense, 5′-TTTCGGGTCATTAGAAGGCG-3′) in all three examined RNAs (isolated from embryos, larvae, and adult flies). The dNOS7 splice variant was identified by RT-PCR of a larval RNA using a pair of primers from exons 1a (as above) and 14a (as above). The dNOS9 transcript was found in all examined RNAs after RT-PCR with oligonucleotides specific to exons 14a (sense, 5′-AAATGTGAACTTTAACTTTTCGCCC-3′) and 18 (antisense, 5′-CCGCAGTGTTAGCAAAAATGTC-3′). Similarly, isoform dNOS10 was found in all examined RNA samples using RT-PCR and primers from exons 12 (sense, 5′-TCCTAGGGCACGCATTCAAT-3′) and 18 (as above). Linearized plasmid (1 μg) bearing exon 16 of the dNOS gene was used as a template for synthesis of a labeled antisense RNA probe using T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the presence of digoxygenin-11 UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Sense digoxygenin-labeled RNA probe from exon 16 was used as a negative control (data not shown). Imaginal discs isolation, fixation, hybridization, post-hybridization washes, and immunostaining were performed essentially as described (9Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The amount of dNOS transcripts was quantified using the real-time RT-PCR method. cDNAs for quantitative analysis were generated by random hexamers (Applied Biosystems) and murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) from 1 μg of total RNA isolated from Drosophila embryos, larvae, or adult flies. An amount of cDNA corresponding to 50 ng of a total RNA taken for the RT was used in PCR. dNOS transcripts were amplified with isoform-specific primers in the presence of fluorescent dye SYBR Green I (Applied Biosystems) using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Primers for PCR were designed using ABI Prism Primer Express software (version 1.0, Applied Biosystems). The dNOS1 transcript was amplified using a pair of primers from exon 13 (sense, 5′-TTGTTGTGGCCTCCACCTTT-3′) and exon 14 (antisense, 5′-CAATCCATGCTCGGAAGACTC-3′). For the detection of the dNOS5transcript, a pair of primers from exon 12a (sense, 5′-ACTTGCCGTAAAGGCCAGC-3′ and antisense, 5′-ACGGAACCAACCGGACACT-3′) was used. A pair of primers from exon 12 (sense, 5′-GCGCCTTATCGAAACGCATA-3′ and antisense, 5′-TTGATGCGTGCCCTAGGAGT-3′) was used for non-selective amplification of all dNOS transcripts. Each cDNA sample was amplified for 40 cycles by denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s and annealing/synthesis at 60 °C for 1 min. Amplification data were analyzed using the ABI Prism sequence detection system software (version 1.7, Applied Biosystems). Standard curves for the 10-fold serial dilutions of each examined amplicon were obtained using the above quantitative PCR approach. The resulting experimental data for each transcript were plotted on a corresponding standard curve to determine the amount of the specific dNOS isoform in a given RNA sample. Expression constructs for enzymatic activity assays contained the protein-coding regions of different dNOS cDNAs, each fused in-frame at the 3′-ends to the sequence of either the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (dNOS1-HA and dNOS3-HA constructs) or the FLAG epitope (dNOS4-FLAG, dNOS5-FLAG, and dNOS6-FLAG constructs) followed by a stop codon. These were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCG, which uses a strong cytomegalovirus promoter to direct transcription of the transgene (12Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). 293 embryonic human kidney cells (293 cells) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Life Technologies) in the presence of 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin. For transient expression, 5 × 106 cells were mixed with a CsCl-purified plasmid DNA in a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) and electroporated at 200 V, 960 microfarads using Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). In all co-transfection experiments a 10-fold molar excess of a truncated dNOS construct (dNOS3-HA, dNOS4-FLAG,dNOS5-FLAG, or dNOS6-FLAG) over the full-length dNOS1-HA construct (2 μg/transfection) was used. The total amount of DNA used for each transfection was kept constant at 25 μg by the addition of vector DNA. Cells were collected 40 h after transfection, and protein extracts were prepared as follows. After harvesting, cells were washed with the phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), resuspended in the extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors leupeptin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and subjected to three rounds of freezing and thawing. After centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, the cleared extracts were used for the NOS activity assay as described (13Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3111) Google Scholar) with modifications. 3V. Scheinker, personal communication. A 150-μl reaction mixture containing 20 μl (20–50 μg) of a soluble protein extract, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2 mmCaCl2, 2.5 μml-arginine, 1 mm NADPH, 20 μmtetrahydro-l-biopterin, 10 μg/ml calmodulin (CaM), 2 μl of l-[3H]arginine (2.04 TBq/mmol, 55.0 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped and processed to determine the extent of conversion of [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline. Protein concentration in the extracts was determined using BCA reagent system (Pierce), and the results were used to normalize the assays. To compare the expression of the dNOS1-HA construct across the co-transfection experiments, equal amounts of protein extracts from the transfected cells were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting as described (14Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 488-501Google Scholar) using the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (15Field J. Nikawa J. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) against HA epitope at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. The same antibody was used to detect the expression of the dNOS3-HA construct. The M2 monoclonal antibody against FLAG epitope (Stratagene) was used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml to check the expression levels of dNOS4-FLAG,dNOS5-FLAG, and dNOS6-FLAG constructs. Immunoblots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 293 cells transfected with various dNOS constructs were harvested 40 h after transfection by scraping into phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and then resuspended in 10 volumes of the lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 μmtetrahydro-l-biopterin, 1 mml-arginine, and protease inhibitors (as above). Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g. Duplicate aliquots of the cleared supernatants (200 μg of total protein) were pre-incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After 1 h at room temperature, either 20 μl of the anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) or 25 μl of the protein G-Sepharose beads, which were pre-absorbed for 1 h with 10 μl of the HA polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), were added to the duplicate samples. After a further incubation for 3 h at room temperature, bound immune complexes were washed three times with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the agarose or Sepharose beads by boiling and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. We used the dNOS1 hybridization probe to isolate several overlapping bacteriophage clones from a Drosophila λDASH genomic library. These clones encompass a continuous 50-kilobase (kb) region of genomic DNA and contain the entire dNOS1 coding sequence (Fig. 1). Four overlapping genomic clones were mapped, and their restriction maps were found to correspond to the maps of the dNOS gene in the Drosophila genome as determined by probing Southern blots with dNOS1 cDNA fragments. Drosophila genomic blots were hybridized under both high and low stringency conditions, and no other NOS-like genes were revealed (data not shown). We searched for other NOS-related genes in Drosophila using PCR with degenerate primers corresponding to a variety of conserved regions of mammalian NOS cDNAs (data not shown). This search failed to identify novel NOS-related genes when tested on genomic DNA or cDNAs from various developmental stages. After we deposited the dNOS gene sequence into the GenBankTM data base, the total Drosophila genome sequence was released (7Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4744) Google Scholar), analysis of which confirmed our conclusion that there is only one chromosomal locus encoding dNOS. The major functional product of the dNOS gene, the full-length protein DNOS1, reveals structural motifs similar to those of mammalian NOS enzymes (6Regulski M. Tully T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It consists of an oxygenase domain at the amino terminus and a reductase domain at the carboxyl terminus, connected by a CaM binding region. We mapped the exons in genomic DNA and determined precise exon-intron boundaries by hybridization and sequencing of the overlapping genomic subclones using oligonucleotides from different parts of the dNOS1 cDNA. Introns were also sequenced in their entirety except for introns 1b, 3, 5–11, and 14. Our estimates of intron sizes (based on restriction mapping, Southern blot analysis, and PCR amplification of genomic DNA) (TableI) were confirmed by analysis of the complete Drosophila genome sequence (7Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4744) Google Scholar). The dNOSgene is composed of 19 exons dispersed over 34 kb of Drosophila genomic DNA. The location and size of exons and introns are shown in Fig. 1 and in Table I. Exons range in size from 67 to 1142 base pairs (bp), and introns range from 0.1 to 6.0 kb. The exon-intron boundaries of the dNOS gene are shown in TableII. All of them conform to the known GT/AG donor/acceptor rule (16Mount S.M. Burks C. Hertz G. Stormo G.D. White O. Fields C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4255-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Translation initiation and termination sites for the dNOS1 are located in exons 2 and 19, respectively. The potential polyadenylation signals AATAAA were found 148 nucleotides (nt) and 226 nt downstream of the stop codon TAA in exon 19. The distribution of the coding sequences among dNOSexons reveals a striking similarity with the human nNOS gene as well as with the mosquito Anopheles stephensi NOS(AsNOS) gene (17Hall A.V. Antoniou H. Wang Y. Cheung A.H. Arbus A.M. Olson S.L. Lu W.C. Kau C.L. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33082-33090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Luckhart S. Rosenberg R. Gene. 1999; 232: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Seven dNOS exons (exons 5–9 and 12–13) are identical in size to exons 6–10 and 14–15, respectively, of the human nNOS gene and are followed by introns of the same type (as determined by the position of a splice junction within a codon) (Table I). Similarly, seven dNOS exons (exons 4–7, 10, 12, and 13) have the same size as the homologous mosquito AsNOS exons (exons 2–5, 7, 10, and 11, respectively), with the intron type being conserved as well (Table I). Evolutionary conservation is found mainly in the region extending from the heme-binding site to beyond the CaM-binding site. This region in mammalian nNOS is responsible for homodimerization and for catalytic conversion of l-arginine intol-citrulline and NO (19Klatt P. Pfeiffer S. List B.M. Lehner D. Glatter O.

In contrast, much of the reductase domain of the Drosophila enzyme is encoded by a single 1142-nt-long exon 16 (Table I), whereas the homologous region in the human nNOS gene is dispersed among eight exons (exons 19–26).Table ILocation and size of exons/introns in the Drosophila NOS geneExonSizeAmino acidsFeaturesIntronSizeTypeHuman nNOSMosquito AsNOSExonIntronExonIntronntkb1a3435′-UTR, dNOS7 1a6.0 1b2325′-UTR, dNOS1, dNOS4- dNOS6 1b5.2 1c2545′-UTR, dNOS8 1c5.31d2985′-UTR, dNOS3—— 27712015′-UTR, poly(Gln) 20.6II 311538Spliced out in dNOS3 34.5O 413746 40.1II 2 (137)2 (II) 516354Heme 51.8O6 (163)6 (O) 3 (163)3 (O) 69231 60.7II7 (92)7 (II) 4 (92)4 (II) 714247 70.7O8 (142)8 (O) 5 (142)5 (O) 814047Spliced out in dNOS2 83.5II9 (140)9 (II) 917558Spliced out in dNOS2 91.3O10 (175)10 (O) 6 (315)6 (O)1018261100.7II 7 (182)7 (II)1121070CaM112.6II1214548CaM120.7O14 (145)14 (O)10 (145)10 (O)13a7324dNOS513b31546dNOS61310535130.1O15 (105)15 (O)11 (105)11 (O)14a10921dNOS4-dNOS7, dNOS9146823144.7II15334111FMN, spliced out in dNOS9 and dNOS10150.2O161142381FAD, NADPH-Rib, spliced out in dNOS9 and dNOS10160.2II1712642NADPH-Ade, spliced out in dNOS9 and dNOS10170.7II186722180.2O1935835NADPH, 3′-UTRIntron type O indicates a splice junction between codons, type I indicates a spice junction after the first nucleotide of a codon, and type II indicates a spice junction after the second nucleotide.

Homologous exons (exon number and size in bp) and intronic splice junction locations (intron number and phase) are shown for the human nNOS and for the mosquito AsNOS genes. Alternatively spliced exons not present in the dNOS1 mRNA are shown in italic. In the original report on the cloning of the dNOS cDNA, two transcripts, dNOS1 and dNOS2, were identified (6Regulski M. Tully T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). dNOS1 encodes a full-length protein, whereas dNOS2 has an in-frame deletion of 315 nt. To investigate the variety of alternative isoforms of dNOS mRNA, we screened cDNA libraries from Drosophila adult heads and larvae and performed 5′-RACE with RNA from embryos, larvae, and adult flies. This search resulted in identification of eight novel dNOS transcripts, which differ both in their 5′-untranslated regions (UTRs) and in their coding regions. We have termed these isoforms dNOS3-dNOS10. We observed four different 5′-ends of the dNOS transcripts (Fig. 2 A), designated as exons 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d. Each variant of exon 1 splices to the common exon 2, which contains the translation initiation codon ATG (preceded by stop codons in all three translation reading frames). None of these alternative exons contain the optimal consensus sequence for the initiation of translation, suggesting that all dNOS isoforms encode proteins with identical amino termini. Isoforms dNOS1, dNOS4, dNOS5, and dNOS6 start with 232-nt-long exon 1b. The dNOS8transcript starts 141 nt upstream of the exon 1b. It utilizes an alternative donor splice site within exon 1b (located 119 nt upstream of a donor splice site for exon 1b), thus generating a 254-nt-long exon 1c (Table II). Isoform dNOS7 starts with 343-nt-long exon 1a spliced to exon 2. Finally, the 5′-end of the dNOS3 isoform, which carries exon 1d, starts 298 nt upstream of exon 2 and continues without splicing into the common exon 2 (Fig. 2 B). All of the presumptive donor/acceptor splice sites conformed to the GT/AG consensus (Table II). Numerous attempts to extend the various cDNA sequences farther upstream using 5′-RACE with the series of primers specific to different variants of exon 1 did not identify any novel 5′-ends other than those described above. This indicates that these exons may represent true transcription initiation sites, suggesting that the dNOS gene may contain at least four alternative promoters. Importantly, the variations in exon 1 do not appear to affect the amino termini of the encoded proteins. Furthermore, alternative splicing of the primary transcript changes the coding capacity of several dNOS isoforms. These changes include single and multiple exon deletions, single and multiple exon insertions, and alternative usage of splicing sites within an exon (Fig. 3 B). Isoform dNOS3 was isolated from a Drosophila 3rd instar larvae cDNA library. It is an example of a single exon deletion within the protein-coding region; dNOS3 lacks the 115-nt-long exon 3 (Fig. 3 B). This creates a frameshift in the mRNA and introduces a stop codon TGA 40 nt downstream of the new splice junction between exons 2 and 4. The resulting open reading frame (ORF) is 642 nt long (each of three cDNA clones examined contained the entire ORF of dNOS3 plus the 5′- and 3′-UTRs) and codes for a"
https://openalex.org/W2321119724,"There is considerable evidence that ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapeutic drugs mediate apoptosis through the intrinsic death pathway via the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and activation of caspases -9 and -3. Here we show that MCF-7 cells that lack caspase-3 undergo a caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in the absence of DNA fragmentation and α-fodrin cleavage following treatment with etoposide or doxorubicin, but not after exposure to IR. Re-expression of caspase-3 restored DNA fragmentation and α-fodrin cleavage following drug treatment, but it did not alter the radiation-resistant phenotype of these cells. In contrast to the anticancer drugs, IR failed to induce the intrinsic death pathway in MCF-7/casp-3 cells, an event readily observed in IR-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells. Although IR-induced DNA double-strand breaks were repaired with similar efficiencies in all cell lines, cell cycle analyses revealed a persistent G2/M arrest in the two MCF-7 cell lines, but not in HeLa cells. Together, our data demonstrate that caspase-3 is required for DNA fragmentation and α-fodrin cleavage in drug-induced apoptosis and that the intrinsic death pathway is fully functional in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, they show that the radiation-resistant phenotype of MCF-7 cells is not due to the lack of caspase-3, but is caused by the failure of IR to activate the intrinsic death pathway. We propose (1) different signaling pathways are induced by anticancer drugs and IR, and (2) IR-induced G2/M arrest prevents the generation of an apoptotic signal required for the activation of the intrinsic death pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2334552535,"The potent growth-inhibitory activity of cytokines of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily and their widespread expression in epithelia suggest that they may play an important role in the maintenance of epithelial homeostasis. To analyse TGF-beta mediated tumor suppressor activity in the liver, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing a dominant negative type II TGF-beta receptor in hepatocytes under control of the regulatory elements of the human C-reactive protein gene promoter. Transgenic animals exhibited constitutive and liver-specific transgene expression. The functional inactivation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway in transgenic hepatocytes was shown by reduced TGF-beta induced inhibition of DNA synthesis in primary hepatocyte cultures. Liver morphology and spontaneous tumorigenesis were unchanged in transgenic mice suggesting that interruption of the signaling of all three isoforms of TGF-beta in hepatocytes does not disturb tissue homeostasis in the liver under physiological conditions. However, following initiation with the carcinogen diethylnitrosamine and tumor-promotion with phenobarbital transgenic mice exhibited a moderate albeit significant increase in the incidence, size and multiplicity of both preneoplastic tissue lesions in the liver and of hepatocellular carcinomas. These results give in vivo evidence for a tumor suppressor activity of the endogenous TGF-beta system in the liver during chemical hepatocarcinogenesis."

We tested whether the divergent aspartate residues of the EEDD locus of low voltage-activated (LVA or T-type) Ca2+ channels account for the distinctive permeation and selectivity features of these channels. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in the HEK293 expression system, we studied the properties of the α1G T-type, the α1CL-type Ca2+ channel subunits, and α1G pore mutants, containing aspartate-to-glutamate conversions in domain III, domain IV, or both. Three characteristic features of HVA Ca2+ channel permeation, i.e. (a) Ba2+ over Ca2+ permeability, (b) Ca2+/Ba2+ anomalous mole fraction effect (AMFE), and (c) high Cd2+ sensitivity, were conferred on the domain III mutant (EEED) of α1G. In contrast, the relative Ca2+/Ba2+ permeability and the lack of AMFE of the α1G wild type channel were retained in the domain IV mutant (EEDE). The double mutant (EEEE) displayed AMFE and a Cd2+ sensitivity similar to that of α1C, but currents were larger in Ca2+- than in Ba2+-containing solutions.

In addition, activation curves of all mutants were displaced to more positive voltages and had a larger slope factor than in α1G wild type. We conclude that the aspartate residues of the EEDD locus of the α1G Ca2+ channel subunit not only control its permeation properties, but also affect its activation curve.

The structural aspects of T-type Ca2+ channel permeation have been addressed in only one abstract so far (29Yang N. Perez-Reyes E. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: A259Google Scholar). These authors replaced L-type Ca2+ channel residues with divergent residues of LVA channels, i.e. phenylalanine-glutamate for lysine-aspartate and glutamate-alanine for aspartate-asparagine in the P-loop of domains III and IV, respectively. These modifications on and around the EEEE locus of the α1C channel subunit decreased the single channel conductance for Ba2+, mimicking the properties of LVA Ca2+ channels. In the present work we wanted to test the extent to which the divergent aspartate residues of the EEDD locus might be responsible for the distinctive permeation properties of the T-type Ca2+channel. To test this, we induced aspartate-glutamate conversions in the T-type Ca2+ channel α1G in, respectively, domain III (D1487E, EEED mutant), domain IV (D1810E, EEDE mutant), and in both domains simultaneously (D1487E and D1810E, EEEE mutant). By means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, we studied the properties of the α1G T-type, the α1CL-type Ca2+ channel subunits, and the constructed mutants after their transient expression in HEK293 cells. We were able to show that permeation properties of the α1G Ca2+channel subunit critically depend on the aspartate residues of its EEDD locus, and that the double mutation of the EEDD locus to EEEE only partially conferred HVA channel permeation properties to α1G Ca2+ channel subunit. The pore mutants were obtained using the standard polymerase chain reaction overlap extension technique with the mouse α1G cDNA, pc3LVA1, accession number AJ012569 (26Klugbauer N. Marais E. Lacinova L. Hofmann F. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 710-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), as template DNA. TheEcoRI-Acc65I fragment of α1G (1532 bp) was first subcloned in the pUC19 vector (New England Biolabs). Mutants were generated by replacing wild type fragments of this pUC19 subclone by the corresponding overlap polymerase chain reaction fragments using the following restriction enzymes: EEDE,Acc65I-BglII fragment (860 bp); EEED,AgeI-BglII fragment (577 bp). Finally, the mutantEcoRI-Acc65I fragment of the pUC19 subclone was used for replacing the corresponding fragment (1532 bp) in the full-length α1G cDNA clone pc3LVA1. To select transfected HEK293 cells prior to analysis, all constructs were finally cloned in the pCAGGS (30Wissenbach U. Bodding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar)-derived bicistronic green fluorescent protein expression vector pCAGGSM2, kindly provided by Prof. V. Flockerzi. Human embryonic kidney cells, HEK293, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) human serum, 2 mm l -glutamine, 2 units ml−1penicillin, and 2 mg ml−1 streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidity controlled incubator with 10% CO2. The cells were transiently transfected with the expression vectors using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The pc3LVA1 vector was used for expression of the wild type α1G channel in HEK293 cells. Before current recordings, cells were rinsed with Krebs solution, containing 150 mm NaCl, 6 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, titrated to pH 7.4 with 1 n NaOH. Basic test solutions contained CaCl2 or BaCl2 20 mm, 130 mm NMDG, 5 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm glucose, and were titrated to pH 7.4 with 1n HCl. In a recent paper (31Serrano J.R. Dashti S.R. Perez-Reyes E. Jones S.W. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 3052-3062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), it has been shown that Mg2+ differentially blocks Ba2+ and Ca2+ currents through the T-type channel α1G, obscuring the actual Ca2+/Ba2+ selectivity. To avoid any influence of extracellular Mg2+ block on the relative size of Ba2+ versus Ca2+currents, bath solutions were kept Mg2+-free. Nevertheless, in our conditions, application of 1 mm extracellular Mg2+ did not significantly affect the amplitude of the currents either carried by 20 mm extracellular Ca2+ or Ba2+ through the T-type channel α1G (data not shown). For mole fraction experiments, the total divalent cation concentration was kept equal at 20 mmwith Ca2+/Ba2+ ratios of 20/0, 15/5, 10/10, 5/15, and 0/20. In the proton block experiments, we substituted HEPES in the extracellular solution by a mixture of MES, HEPES, and TAPS (5 mm each) to extend the buffering range from pH 5.5 to 9.1. The intracellular (pipette) solution contained 102 mm CsCl, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na2-ATP, 10 mm TEA-Cl, 10 mm EGTA, titrated to pH 7.4 with 1 n CsOH. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Currents were recorded in the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique using an EPC-7 (List Electronics, Darmstadt, Germany) patch-clamp amplifier and filtered with an eight-pole Bessel filter (Kemo, Beckenham, United Kingdom). For control of voltage-clamp protocols and data acquisition, we used an IBM-compatible PC with a TL-1 DMA interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and the software pCLAMP 6 (Axon Instruments). Exchange of bath solution occurred via a multibarrelled pipette connected to solution reservoirs and was controlled by a set of magnetic valves. Patch pipettes (1.5–2.5 megohms) were pulled from Vitrex capillary tubes (Modulohm, Herlev, Denmark) using a DMZ-Universal puller (Zeitz Instruments, Augsburg, Germany). An Ag-AgCl wire was used as reference electrode. Membrane capacitative transients were electronically compensated to the maximum extent possible. Current traces were filtered at 2–5 kHz and digitized at 5–10 kHz. The experiments were performed at room temperature (20–25 °C). Electrophysiological data were analyzed and fitted using the WinASCD software package (G. Droogmans, Laboratory of Physiology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium).I-V relations obtained from peak current amplitudes were fitted to Equation 1, where I is the measured peak current,G max is the slope conductance, V is the test potential, V r is the apparent reversal potential, V 1/2 is the potential of half-maximal activation, and s act the slope parameter for activation.I=Gmax·(V−Vr)1+exp(−(V−V1/2)/sact)Equation 1 For statistical analysis and graphical presentation of the data, we used Origin version 5.0. Pooled data are given as mean ± S.E. of all the measurements. We used Student's t test, takingp < 0.05 or p < 0.01 as level of significance. Fig. 1 A shows the positions of the glutamate and aspartate residues that form the EEDD and EEEE pore locus of the α1G and the α1C Ca2+ channel subunits, respectively.Panels B–F show current traces recorded in 20 mm Ca2+ or Ba2+ for α1G, α1C, and the pore mutants, respectively. The insets of panels D–F depict the point mutations in domains III and IV of the α1GCa2+ channel subunit. Currents through α1Gand α1C subunits showed their characteristic patterns,i.e. larger Ca2+ than Ba2+ currents for α1G, but the opposite for α1C, which also showed a marked Ca2+-dependent inactivation. The domain III mutant of α1G (EEED) displayed larger Ba2+ than Ca2+ currents (α1C phenotype), but this was not the case for the domain IV mutant (EEDE) or for the double mutant (EEEE). This was confirmed by a more quantitative analysis of theI-V relations for α1G, α1C, and the mutants with either Ca2+ or Ba2+ as the charge carrier (Fig. 2). To account for the differences in current density between cells, which may partly reflect differences in expression efficiency for the various constructs, we have compared the slope conductance of Ca2+relative to that of Ba2+(G MaxCa/G MaxBa) for the various channels. The values of G MaxCa andG MaxBa were derived from the fits of the data points to equation (1McDonald T.F. Pelzer S. Trautwein W. Pelzer D.J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 365-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). From the pooled data in Fig. 2 F, it is obvious that this ratio is larger than 1 for α1G, the EEDE mutant, and the double mutant EEEE, but the opposite is true for the domain III mutant (EEED). Both mutants in which aspartate was exchanged for glutamate in domain III showed large outward currents (presumably carried by Cs+) (Fig. 2, C andE). In the EEEE mutant with Ba2+ as the charge carrier, this outward current shows prominent outward rectification and a less positive reversal potential, hindering the fitting of theI-V curve with Equation 1 over the entire voltage range studied (Fig. 2 E). Besides their effects on Ca2+/Ba2+ selectivity, these mutations also affected channel activation curves, as is evident from Fig. 3 (A andB). Indeed, the voltage of half-maximal activation was significantly displaced to more depolarized potentials and the slope factors were increased in the three mutants when compared with wild type α1G using either Ca2+ or Ba2+ as the charge carrier. The effects were more pronounced for the mutation in domain III (EEED and EEEE mutants) when Ca2+ was the charge carrier (Fig. 3, C andD). The anomalous mole fraction effect has been related to different ion-channel interactions of two permeating ions (7Almers W. McCleskey E.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 353: 585-608Crossref Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 9Hess P. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1984; 309: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 32Hille B. Schwarz W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1978; 72: 409-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). We therefore explored the properties of the currents through the α1G subunit at different Ca2+-Ba2+ mole fractions and tested if replacement of the T-type Ca2+ channel residues, which are divergent from those of the EEEE locus of HVA Ca2+channels, confers anomalous mole fraction behavior on the α1G channels. We therefore studied the effects of Ca2+/Ba2+ mixtures at millimolar concentration ratios of 20/0, 15/5, 10/10, 5/15, and 0/20 on the amplitude of the currents elicited by 200-ms voltage steps to 0 mV applied from a holding potential of −100 mV. Fig. 4shows representative current traces for α1G, α1C, and the pore mutants EEED, EEDE, and EEEE in different mixtures of Ca2+ and Ba2+. To account for differences in current amplitude between channels and cells, we have normalized the current amplitudes in each mixture to that in 20 mm Ba2+ in each cell. Averaged data for the wild types and mutant channels are shown in Fig. 4 F. α1G does not show the AMFE, because the current decreased monotonically if extracellular Ba2+ was substituted in equimolar fashion by increasing Ca2+ concentrations (Fig.4 A). It has been demonstrated that the AMFE depends on the total divalent cation concentration and on membrane potential (10Friel D.D. Tsien R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5207-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Yue D.T. Marban E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 911-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Campbell D.L. Rasmusson R.L. Strauss H.C. Biophys. J. 1988; 54: 945-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The lack of a prominent AMFE in α1C is therefore not surprising, but rather indicates that our experimental conditions might not be optimal for demonstrating the effect in this channel. On the other hand, our results are almost identical to those previously reported for α1C and α1A subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes (2Mangoni M.E. Cens T. Dalle C. Nargeot J. Charnet P. Receptors Channels. 1997; 5: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar). In any case, current traces of α1C show a similar fast Ca2+-dependent inactivation pattern in all Ca2+ containing ion mixtures (Fig. 4 B), which is a clear indication that Ca2+ binds preferentially over Ba2+ to the α1C channel. The EEED mutant, however, clearly showed AMFE because the amplitude of the current in the 10/10 mixture was significantly smaller than those recorded in 20 mm Ca2+ or Ba2+(Fig. 4 C). Mutation of the aspartate residue in domain IV did not alter the features of the α1G wild type, as the normalized current amplitudes of both channels are practically superimposed for all ion mixtures. The mutant EEEE showed a complex behavior; Ca2+ currents were ∼3.5 times larger than those in 20 mm Ba2+, but low Ca2+concentrations were able to block Ba2+ currents. EEEE, therefore, combines Ca2+ over Ba2+ permeability and AMFE shown for EEDE (or α1G) and EEED, respectively. The EEEE locus has been found to be the protonation site of the L-type Ca2+ channel pore (20Klockner U. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Varadi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22293-22296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33Chen X.H. Bezprozvanny I. Tsien R.W. J. Gen.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30002-30008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) showed that substitution of glutamate residues for aspartate in domains I and III destabilized the protonated state, whereas the same mutations in domains II and IV did not alter and stabilized protonation, respectively. By comparing the effects of extracellular pH on Ca2+ current amplitude through α1G and the pore mutants, we were able to study the effects of the opposite mutation, i.e. aspartate-to-glutamate, on the proton block pattern, but now using the α1G Ca2+ channel as a template. Reduction of extracellular pH from 9.1 to 7.4 did not provoke any changes in the amplitude of the Ca2+ current through α1G, whereas a further acidification to 5.5 produced a significant but incomplete block of the Ca2+ current (Fig.5 A). In contrast, the current was significantly reduced in all three pore mutants by decreasing extracellular pH from 9.1 to 7.4, and completely blocked at pH 5.5 (Fig. 5, B–D). Fig. 5 E shows the inhibition of the Ca2+ current through α1G and the three pore mutants as a function of extracellular pH. The percentage of current block at each pH was calculated as the percentage of current reduction with respect to the corresponding current in the same cell at pH 9.1. Experimental data were fitted to a Hill function of the form shown in Equation 2, wherepK a is the proton association constant andn is the Hill coefficient.%of block=1001+10(pH−pKa)·nEquation 2 For α1G, pK a was 6.05 ± 0.10 and n was 0.93 ± 0.13. Both single mutants showed a significantly higher sensitivity to proton block than the wild type channel, which was, however, not significantly different between both mutants. The fitted parameters for these mutant channels were pK a = 6.98 ± 0.07 and n = 0.67 ± 0.08 for EEED and pK a = 6.87 ± 0.10 and n = 0.76 ± 0.11 for EEDE. Interestingly, the pH dependence of the double mutant EEEE with a pK a = 7.04 ± 0.10 and n = 0.75 ± 0.11 did not significantly differ from that of the single mutants. High Cd2+ sensitivity is a particular feature of HVA Ca2+ channels (1McDonald T.F. Pelzer S. Trautwein W. Pelzer D.J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 365-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 6Huguenard J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 329-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 14Vassort G. Alvarez J. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1994; 5: 376-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The study of Cd2+ block on the Ca2+ currents through the α1G pore mutants EEED, EEDE, and EEEE enabled us to demonstrate that the aspartate residues of the EEDD locus of α1G are structural determinants for the low Cd2+ sensitivity of T-type Ca2+ channels. Fig. 6 shows examples of the effect of extracellular Cd2+ (100 and 300 μm) on the Ca2+ currents through α1G, α1C, and the pore mutants EEED, EEDE, and EEEE during 200-ms voltage steps to 0 mV from a holding potential of −100 mV. In contrast to α1G, Ca2+ currents through α1C were efficiently blocked by 100 μmCd2+ (Fig. 6, A and B). Both single mutants, EEED and EEDE, are more sensitive to Cd2+ block than wild type α1G (Fig. 6, C andD). The double mutant EEEE (Fig. 6 E) is almost as sensitive as wild type α1C to block by Cd2+. Fig. 6 F shows dose-response curves for Cd2+block of the various channels and their fit to Equation 3, whereKd is the dissociation constant and nis the Hill coefficient.%of block=1001+(Kd/[Cd2+])nEquation 3 Wild type α1G showed the lowest Cd2+sensitivity (Kd = 700 ± 50 μm, n = 0.78 ± 0.04). The single mutants EEED and EEDE showed a steeper concentration dependence and higher affinity of the block than α1G, but the corresponding values for Kd and n of 260 ± 50 μm, 1.18 ± 0.14 for EEED and 240 ± 15 μm, 1.03 ± 0.04 for EEDE were not significantly different from each other. The double mutant EEEE was nearly 5 times more sensitive to Cd2+ than the single mutants (Kd = 57 ± 6 μm,n = 1.34 ± 0.13) and slightly different from α1C (K d = 36 ± 3 μm, n = 1.5 ± 0.2). This study is the first structural approach of the permeation properties of T-type Ca2+ channels. The main conclusions are that the aspartate residues of the EEDD pore locus of the T-type Ca2+ channel subunit α1G determine the conduction properties of this channel, and that the exchange of divergent residues in the pore locus of α1G for the corresponding residues in α1C induces some, but not all typical permeation properties of HVA Ca2+ channels. To our knowledge, the only study addressing the structural determinants of the differences in permeation between T-type and HVA Ca2+ channels, using the L-type channel subunit α1C as template, has been published in abstract form (29Yang N. Perez-Reyes E. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: A259Google Scholar). These authors induced modifications in and around the EEEE locus of the α1C Ca2+ channel subunit to mimic the corresponding structure of T-type Ca2+ channels. They exchanged the phenylalanine-glutamate pair in domain III and the glutamate-alanine pair in domain IV of α1C for the lysine-aspartate and aspartate-asparagine pairs of α1G, respectively, and observed that the single-channel conductance for Ba2+ currents was reduced by a factor of 2 compared with that of α1C wild type. The authors concluded that these structural modifications conferred T-type permeation properties on α1C. In a recent paper, Feng et al. (23Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Doering C. Jarvis S.E. Bosey G.M. Bourinet E. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5726-5730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the disruption of a potential putative EF-hand motif, located outside the narrow region of the N-type Ca2+ channel α1B, increased the Ca2+ conductance while leaving the Ba2+ conductance unaltered. They suggested that selective Ca2+ binding to the putative EF-hand could result in a localized conformational change in the channel, resulting in a reduction of the Ca2+ conductance. Given that this EF-hand motif is highly conserved in HVA Ca2+ channels and not in T-type Ca2+ channels, they suggested that this could explain why these channels have different relative Ca2+/Ba2+ permeabilities. However, as pointed out by these authors, the putative EF-hand motif is conserved in R-type (α1E) Ca2+ channels, but they exhibit the same Ca2+ and Ba2+ permeabilities. In the present work, however, we unequivocally show that the transfer of a single amino acid residue of HVA Ca2+ channels (particularly mutation D1487E) to the α1G T-type Ca2+ channel subunit is sufficient to induce three characteristic features of HVA Ca2+ channel permeation: (a) Ba2+ over Ca2+ permeability, (b) Ca2+/Ba2+ anomalous mole fraction effect, and (c) high Cd2+sensitivity. Modification of the EEDD pore locus not only provoked changes in relative Ca2+/Ba2+ permeabilities of α1G, they also induced changes in the activation curves. All mutants displayed a more positive voltage for half-maximum activation and a larger slope factor than the α1G wild type. These effects were rather unexpected for mutations in the pore region. Delisle and Satin (35Delisle B.P. Satin J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1895-1905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed that external acidification from pH 8.2 to pH 5.5 induces a similar shift of the activation curve of the α1H T-type channel to more depolarized potentials and an increase of its slope factor. These effects were paralleled by an increase of outward current amplitudes and a shift of the reversal potential to more negative values. These authors suggested that channel protonation induces modifications in the gating properties and reduces Ca2+/monovalent ion relative permeability of the T-type Ca2+ channel α1H. The similarity with our findings suggests that the changes in activation curves induced by aspartate-to-glutamate mutations on the EEDD pore locus of α1G may be caused by the altered pattern of proton block in these mutants. This is strongly supported by the fact that all the mutants show higher sensitivity to the proton block than the α1G wild type. Whether proton-induced modifications of activation curves of α1G are due to modifications of channel gating (35Delisle B.P. Satin J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1895-1905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and/or to voltage-dependent proton block (36Woodhull A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 61: 687-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar) remains to be investigated. However, whatever the underlying mechanism, our data strongly suggest that the proton-binding site triggering these modifications is built in the EEDD pore locus. It is clear from our results that the aspartate of domain III in the EEDD locus has the largest influence on the overall conducting properties of the T-type Ca2+channel α1G. Inverted relative Ca2+/Ba2+ permeability, AMFE, and large outward monovalent fluxes are induced in the α1G Ca2+channel when the aspartate of domain III but not that of domain IV was mutated to a glutamate. This is in line with previous results, which indicate that the glutamate residues of domains I and III are the most critical for the ion conduction properties of HVA Ca2+channels (21Varadi G. Strobeck M. Koch S. Caglioti L. Zucchi C. Palyi G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 181-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the domain IV mutant (EEDE) retained the same relative Ca2+/Ba2+ permeability, the absence of AMFE, and the absence of monovalent cation outward fluxes of the α1G wild type channel. Still, it displayed the same qualitative changes in activation properties and in proton and Cd2+ sensitivity of the EEED mutant. The double mutant EEEE showed the most complex features. Its behavior was expected to be the closest to that of α1C, but, although it displayed the AMFE and the highest Cd2+sensitivity among the mutants, it showed large outward fluxes, Ca2+ currents that were much larger than Ba2+currents, and the same proton sensitivity as the single mutants. Although the binding of Ba2+ to the channel is weaker in this mutant, it still permeates at a lower rate than Ca2+. A possible explanation for this paradoxical result is that elongation of side chains by the mutation of both aspartate residues for glutamate may increase the sieving properties, as well as the proton affinity of the α1G channel. In this case, Ba2+ fluxes would be impaired because of its larger ionic radius and its smaller capability for competition with protons for binding sites of the channel. The presence of the AMFE in the EEED and the EEEE mutants and its absence in the EEDE mutant suggests that, independent of the changes induced on the Ca2+/Ba2+ relative permeability, substitution of the aspartate residue of domain III by glutamate consistently increases the binding affinity of the α1G channel subunit for Ca2+ over Ba2+. The experiments of H+ and Cd2+ block of Ca2+ currents gave additional information about the contribution of individual mutations. All mutants show the same increase in proton sensitivity of the Ca2+ current compared with the wild type, suggesting that both aspartates of domains III and IV contribute equally to the proton block in the α1GCa2+ channel and that the block is not further enhanced by the double mutation. Interestingly, glutamate-to-aspartate mutation in domain III of the L-type Ca2+ channel α1Creduced proton block of K+ currents by ∼50% compared with that in the wild type channel, whereas the same mutation but in the IV domain stabilized the protonated state (34Chen X.H. Tsien R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30002-30008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Regarding the Cd2+ block, both single mutants showed a nearly 3-fold increase in Cd2+ sensitivity when compared with the α1G wild type. In contrast, Ellinor etal. (37Ellinor P.T. Yang J. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1121-1132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mutations of the glutamate residue of domain III of the α1C Ca2+ channel subunit had a larger impact on the IC50 for the Cd2+ block of Ba2+ currents than mutations in domain IV. Interestingly, the double mutant showed a 5-fold increase of the Cd2+ sensitivity over that of the α1Gwild type, with a Kd very close to that obtained for L-type α1C. This indicates that, unlike the case of H+, Cd2+ affinity for the channel increases when the side chains are enlarged by substituting the aspartates in domains III and IV with glutamate. The simplest explanation for the incomplete transfer of permeation properties of HVA Ca2+ channels to α1G is that other structural elements besides the EEEE or EEDD locus of these channels contribute to the differences in selectivity and permeation properties between Ca2+ channels. Following the results of other authors, at least three possibilities can be outlined. First, lysine and asparagine residues are found close to the EEDD locus of α1G, but phenylalanine and alanine residues in the vicinity of the EEEE locus of all HVA Ca2+ channels (29Yang N. Perez-Reyes E. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: A259Google Scholar). The second structural candidate is the potential putative EF-hand motif located outside the narrow region of all HVA Ca2+ channels, which is absent in all three LVA Ca2+ channel α1 subunits (23Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Doering C. Jarvis S.E. Bosey G.M. Bourinet E. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5726-5730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Third, it might be possible, given the rather low sequence identity between the channels, that the backbone structures sustaining the selectivity filters (EEEE and EEDD locus) are not the same, which might result in a different spatial arrangement of the negative residues. Another corollary of this study is that not only the structural features of Ca2+ channels, but also intra- and extracellular ionic composition determine to a large extent relative Ca2+/Ba2+ permeability. In this sense, our results give further support to the view of ion conduction through Ca2+ channels as the complex compendium of multiple effects, namely ion-ion interactions, differential ion affinities for binding ligands, interactions between pore structures, and ionic sieving.

https://openalex.org/W2081994887,"Axin, an important regulator of beta-catenin, is frequently mutated in human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), and transduction of the wild-type Axin gene (AXIN1) induces apoptosis in HCC cells as well as in colon cancer cells. To investigate the detailed biological function of Axin, we searched on a cDNA microarray for genes whose expression was altered by transfer of wild-type AXIN1 into colon-cancer cell line LoVo. Among the genes showing altered expression, we focused on one, termed AXUD1 (AXIN1 up-regulated), that revealed enhanced expression in response to exogenously expressed AXIN1 but not to LacZ, a control gene. The AXUD1 gene consists of five exons and encodes a transcript with an open reading frame of 1767 bp. A 3.2-kb transcript of AXUD1 was expressed in all human tissues examined, most abundantly in lung, placenta, skeletal muscle, pancreas and leukocyte. By radiation-hybrid mapping we assigned its chromosomal location at 3p22, a region where frequent loss of heterozygosity has been reported in lung, renal, prostate, breast and cervical cancers. AXUD1 was frequently down-regulated in lung, kidney, liver and colon cancers compared with their corresponding normal tissues, suggesting that AXUD1 may have a tumor-suppressor function in those organs."
https://openalex.org/W2318196164,"The members of the Src kinase family are expressed in a wide variety of tissues, but some of them such as Blk, Hck, Fgr, Lck and Lyn are found primarily in hematopoietic cells. In the present study, we have undertaken experiments to test whether Src kinase cleavage and relocation is a general mechanism during induction of apoptosis. Our results indicate that Fyn and Lyn are efficiently cleaved in their unique region in hematopoietic cells undergoing apoptosis. Fyn cleavage occurred in Fas-stimulated Jurkat T cells but Fyn and Lyn were also processed in the SKW6.4 B cell line. Inhibition of caspases by Z-VAD-fmk or Ac-DEVD-CHO totally prevented Fyn and Lyn cleavage in both intact cells and in vitro. Fyn and Lyn but not Lck, Src and Hck were processed in vitro by human recombinant caspase 3 and by cellular extracts prepared from Fas-stimulated cells. Single mutation of Asp 19 or Asp 18 in the unique N-terminal domains of Fyn and Lyn respectively abolished their cleavage and relocation into the cytoplasm of apoptotic cells. When immunoprecipitated from COS cells N-terminal deleted Src kinases exhibited increased enzymatic kinase activity toward enolase. Thus, cleavage of Fyn and Lyn during induction of apoptosis represents a new mechanism for the regulation of Src kinases that may have important functional and physiological consequences."

Vac1p, and the related human protein EEA1, link PI3K signaling directly to SNARE-mediated vesicle trafficking within endosomal pathways by directly binding PtdIns(3)P, SNAREs, and other required factors such as the SEC1 family protein, Vps45p (8Peterson M.R.

In addition to this role in regulating fusion of post-Golgi membranes, Vps34p produces substrate for the Fab1 phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 5-kinase, which has been implicated in protein sorting within late endosomes and multivesicular body endosomes (10Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Besides these roles for PtdIns(3)P, other roles are likely to be discovered as more PtdIns(3)P-binding proteins are characterized. The downstream effects of PI3K signaling are, in many cases, mediated by proteins containing a PtdIns(3)P-binding protein module called a FYVE finger domain. FYVE domains comprise a subfamily of RING domains, identified by the spacing of cysteine and/or histidine residues which bind two atoms of zinc and are required for the overall structure of the domain (11Misra S. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 12Kutateladze T.G. Ogburn K.D. Watson W.T. de Beer T. Emr S.D. Burd C.G. Overduin M. Mol.

Cell. 2000; 100: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The hallmark of the FYVE finger subfamily is a patch of basic residues surrounding the third zinc-coordinating cysteine residue which forms, together with other conserved basic residues, the PtdIns(3)P binding pocket (14Kutateladze T. Overduin M. Science. 2001; 291: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The yeast genome encodes five FYVE domain-containing proteins, and three of these proteins, Vac1p, Vps27p, and Fab1p, regulate aspects of endosomal protein sorting. No functions have been described for the remaining two FYVE domain proteins, which we have named Pib1p and Pib2p (PtdIns (3Kihara A. Noda T. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar)P-binding). We have discovered that Pib1p, in addition to a FYVE domain, contains a second RING-related domain containing binding sites for two zinc atoms. Localization of Pib1p to endosomal and vacuolar membranes is mediated solely by the FYVE domain. We demonstrate that the RING domain exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, suggesting that Pib1p may function in ubiquitination of endosomal and vacuolar proteins. Standard media (YPD, SM dropout) were used for culturing S. cerevisiae strains (15Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence L.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar). All yeast strains were derivatives of SEY6210 (MATα,ura3–52, his3-Δ200, trp1-Δ901, lys2–801, suc2-Δ9, leu2–3, 11). Thepib1Δ::HIS3 deletion strain, CBY56, was constructed by transformation of SEY6210 with a DNA cassette generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify the HIS3 locus and were tailed with 40 bases of sequence identical to a region of thePIB1 locus immediately upstream of the start codon and immediately downstream of the stop codon (16Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The resultant transformants were screened by PCR to confirm that the PIB1locus was replaced with the HIS3 cassette and by immunoblotting with anti-Pib1p antibodies to confirm loss of Pib1 protein. Standard DNA cloning methods were used (17Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). For culturing Escherichia coli DH5α and BL21 strains, LB media containing selective antibiotics was used (17Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The cloned PIB1 gene was obtained by PCR using Taqpolymerase and oligonucleotide primers which were designed to amplifyPIB1 and 400 base pairs upstream and downstream of the start and stop codons. Nucleotides, Taq polymerase, EXPAND polymerase, and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, New England Biolabs, and Promega. PCR products were first cloned into pTOPO using a TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen), then moved into appropriate bacterial or yeast expression vectors (see below). Gene overlap extension PCR was used to construct the C23S and C225S pib1 point mutants (18Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). Primers were designed to change one base of the appropriate cysteine codon to a serine codon. The DNA sequences of all PCR-amplified DNAs were confirmed by sequencing. DNA fragments were purified using a Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Pib1p derivatives were expressed in E. coli as fusions to GST using pGEX-KG as vector, or with an amino-terminal fusion to a polyhistidine tag using pET28. Recombinant GST fusion protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and His-tagged protein on His-Bind resin (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eluted His-tagged protein was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline overnight. GST fusion proteins were eluted using 50 mm reduced glutathione, and elution buffer was immediately exchanged into storage buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol) using PD10 desalting columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST fusion proteins were stored at 4 or −80 °C in storage buffer diluted to 50% glycerol. The concentration of recombinant proteins was determined using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To calculate the concentration of GST-Pib1(RING) fusion proteins, a molecular weight of 49,600 was used. Zinc content of recombinant proteins was determined using a colorimetric assay (19Giedroc D.P. Keating K.M. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. Coleman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8452-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and compared to a standard curve generated using known amounts of ZnCl2. The standard curve was generated by determining the absorbance of 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol at 500 nm of 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 µM ZnCl2. Triplicate measurements were made and the average of the three measurements was used to generate the standard curve. The concentration of GST-Pib1(RING) in the analysis of bound zinc was 3.57 µmfor wild-type GST-Pib1(RING) and 22.2 µm for the C225S mutant GST-Pib1(RING). More mutant protein was used compared with wild-type protein so that an accurate value of bound zinc could be obtained. Zinc content of three aliquots of each protein was measured. The concentration of bound zinc was determined from the standard curve and used to calculate the mole ratio of released zinc to protein. The average and standard deviations of these values were plotted in Fig.1. Gene fusions to green fluorescent protein were constructed by cloning PCR-derived PIB1 DNAs into pGO-GFP (20Cowles C.R. Odorizzi G. Payne G.S. Emr S.D. Cell. 1997; 91: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The full-length GFP-Pib1p fusion vector has been described (6Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 157-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). To construct the GFP-Pib1(FYVE) fusion, the full-length GFP-Pib1p vector was cut withKpnI, and then resealed. This vector directed the expression of Pib1p amino acids 1–107. A GFP-Pib1(RING) vector was constructed as follows. A DraI, SspI fragment of PIB1(native PIB1 sites) was cloned into the SmaI site of pGO-GFP (20Cowles C.R. Odorizzi G. Payne G.S. Emr S.D. Cell. 1997; 91: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). This vector directed the expression of Pib1p amino acids 91–286 fused to GFP. A rabbit antiserum was raised against a His-tagged Pib1 fusion protein (amino acids 91–286) by Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). The GST-Pib1 fusion protein (amino acids 91–286) was used to affinity purify antibodies from 10 ml of sera. To do so, ∼3 mg of fusion protein was cross-linked to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antisera was collected from the beads by acid elution and immediately exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline by gel filtration on a PD10 column. Glycerol was added to 50% and the antisera was stored at −80 °C. The antisera was used at 75 pg/ml for immunoblotting. Detection was done using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antiserum (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and an ECL Plus kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subcellular fractionation was carried out as described in Burd et al. (4Burd C.G. Peterson M. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1089-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts used for immunoblotting were prepared as follows. Cultures were harvested at A600between 0.5 and 0.8, and sodium azide and sodium fluoride were added to 0.1 mm. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of a solution of 0.25 m NaOH, 0.14 mβ-mercaptoethanol, and incubated on ice for 30 min. One hundred microliters of trichloroacetic acid was added and the mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min. Precipitated material was collected by centrifugation, washed twice with 1 ml of acetone (−20 °C), then dried in a Speed-Vac. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to 0.025A600 equivalents per microliter. The pellets were resuspended, heated to 70 °C for 10 min, and 0.5A600 equivalents were loaded per lane on 10% acrylamide gels. Endocytic uptake of FM4-64 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) by wild-type cells expressing GFP-Pib1p was done as follows. FM4-64 was diluted from a Me2SO stock into YPD media to a concentration of 3.2 nm. Cells from a logarithmically growing culture (A600 ∼ 0.5) were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 30 s. Media was aspirated and the cells were resuspended in YPD + FM4-64 and immediately placed on ice for 10 min. Cells were then collected by centrifugation as described above and resuspended in 250 µl of ice-cold YPD without FM4-64. To initiate endocytosis of the dye, cells were placed at room temperature (22–23 °C) and aliquots were withdrawn and observed at 10-min intervals. Images were captured on Leica DM IRBE inverted microscope fitted with a ×63 plan-apo lens. GFP-Pib1p and FM4-64 signals were observed using a Chroma 41001 and Chroma 41004 filter sets. There was no interference of GFP and FM4-64 signals. Images were captured and processed using Openlab version 2.2.5 (Leica) Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Fluorescence microscopy of GFP-Pib1p constructs in Fig. 4was done using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope fitted with a cooled, high-resolution charge-coupled device camera (model C4742–95, Hammamatsu Photogenics, Bridegwater, NJ). Images were acquired using Phase 3 Imaging software (Phase 3 Imaging Systems, Glen, PA) and subsequently manipulated using Adobe PhotoShop version 5.0. Strains were grown in selective media overnight and the following morning a fresh culture was inoculated and grown at 26 °C until anA600 of ∼0.5. Approximately 3 µl of culture was mounted on a glass slide and visualized. E1 (rabbit) and E2 (human Ubc5a, yeast Ubc4p) enzymes were purchased from Affiniti Research Products Limited (Exeter, United Kingdom). Ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ubiquitination assays contained the following: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 nm E1, 2.5 µM GST-Ubc5a, 5 µM ubiquitin, and 5 µg of recombinant protein to be tested. Reactions were mixed on ice, incubated at room temperature for 2 h, then stopped by the addition of 5 reaction volumes of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Ubiquitin conjugates were detected after SDS-PAGE by immunoblotting with a rabbit anti-ubiquitin antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) used at a 1:1000 dilution. The amino-terminal region of Pib1p contains a FYVE domain which binds PtdIns(3)P (6Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 157-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The region of Pib1p following the FYVE domain is rich in cysteine and histidine residues (17 Cys/His residues within 196 amino acids), and the spacing of eight Cys and His residues in the last 61 amino acids conforms to a RING motif (21Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). If the carboxyl-terminal region of Pib1p contains a RING domain, it is predicted to bind 2 mol eq of zinc. To test this, a region of Pib1p containing the putative RING domain (amino acids 91–286) was expressed in bacteria as a fusion to GST, purified, and zinc content was determined using a colorimetric assay (Fig. 1). This region of Pib1p bound ∼2 mol eq of zinc (average of three determinations, 2.3 ± 0.14), consistent with the prediction that this region forms a RING structural domain. As a control, a mutation in the codon of a predicted zinc-coordinating residue in one of the zinc-binding pockets, C225S, was constructed and the zinc content of the mutant protein was determined. Based on analogous mutations in other RING domains (22Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), this mutation is predicted to reduce or completely abolish zinc binding. The mutant protein bound ∼0.24 ± 0.01 mol eq of zinc, suggesting that the global structure of this domain is dependent on zinc binding. Moreover, in multiple preparations this mutant fusion protein was partially degraded (data not shown), whereas the wild-type fusion protein was highly stable, consistent with this region forming a stable structure that is dependent on zinc binding. These results strongly suggest that Pib1p contains a carboxyl-terminal RING domain, in addition to the previously reported FYVE domain. To determine whether Pib1p is expressed in vegetative cells, we raised a polyclonal antiserum to a region of Pib1p encompassing amino acids 91–286 and affinity purified it on a GST-Pib1(RING) column. This antiserum specifically detected a protein of ∼43 kDa in wild-type cells that was absent in an extract prepared from cells deleted for thePIB1 gene and two prominent species at ∼48 and 60 kDa that are, however, present in the extract of pib1Δ cells (Fig.2). The relative molecular mass of native Pib1p (43 kDa) is substantially greater than predicted (32.5 kDa) and this is an intrinsic property of the RING-containing region because amino acids 91–286, when expressed in E. coli, migrated ∼11 kDa more slowly than predicted (data not shown). In cells overexpressing PIB1 from a multicopy 2-µm vector, a substantial increase in the amount of Pib1p was observed, as well as a band that migrated slightly more slowly (indicated with anarrow in Fig. 2). When expressed as a fusion to GFP, Pib1p appeared to be entirely associated with membranes (6Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 157-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The Pib1p antiserum was used to determine the proportion of Pib1p that is membrane associated using subcellular fractionation. Spheroplasts prepared from a wild-type strain were lysed and several particulate fractions and a soluble fraction were generated by successive centrifugations, and the proportion of Pib1p in various fractions was determined using anti-Pib1p immunoblotting (Fig. 2). Approximately equal proportions of Pib1p were present in the particulate (sum of all pellet fractions) and soluble fractions. Pib1p in the particulate fractions was distributed between the 300 × g, 13,000 × g, and 100,000 × g fractions (Fig. 2). We have shown previously that in living cells a GFP-Pib1p fusion protein localizes to punctate structures and to the vacuole membrane, which is similar to the localization of a GFP human EEA1 FYVE domain fusion protein (6Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 157-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The punctate structures decorated by GFP-EEA1(FYVE) are endosomes based on the observation that a fluorescent endocytic tracer, the lipophilic dye FM4-64, passes through the GFP-Pib1p-labeled structures during transport to the vacuole. Using this same experimental approach, we tested if GFP-Pib1p localizes to endosome membranes. Wild-type cells expressing GFP-Pib1p were incubated for 10 min on ice in media containing FM4-64 to label the plasma membrane (23Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). The cells were then collected by centrifugation, resuspended in ice-cold YPD (without FM4-64), and returned to ice. The culture was then transferred to ambient temperature (22 °C) to initiate a wave of endocytic uptake of FM4-64 and at 10-min intervals FM4-64 and GFP-Pib1p fluorescence were examined by fluorescence microscopy. No co-localization was observed between time 0 and 20 min (not shown), times when early endocytic intermediates are labeled by FM4-64 (23Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). At the 30-min time point, however, most GFP-Pib1p-labeled structures were also stained by FM4-64 (Fig.3), indicating that the puncta labeled by GFP-Pib1p are endosomes. Co-localization at this relatively late time point suggests that the puncta decorated with GFP-Pib1p are probably late endosomes. After 60 min, all FM4-64 had been delivered to the vacuole (data not shown). To investigate the importance of each of the Pib1p domains for intracellular localization, we constructed GFP fusion proteins with Pib1p point mutants in which zinc-coordinating cysteine residues of the FYVE domain (C23S) or the RING domain (C225S) had been changed. Each of these proteins was expressed in wild-type cells and localization determined by fluorescence microscopy (Fig.4). Full-length GFP-Pib1p localized to 1–5 small puncta per cell that correspond to endosomal compartments, and to the vacuole membrane as observed previously (6Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 157-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Note that in these micrographs the vacuole membrane signal is difficult to fully appreciate because of the intense fluorescence of the puncta. In contrast, the C23S FYVE domain mutant did not localize to endosomal/vacuole compartments, but rather, it was diffusely distributed throughout the cell. Surprisingly, in many cells GFP signal from this mutant protein was observed in the nucleus, but a GFP-Pib1p(RING) domain construct lacking the FYVE domain does not localize to the nucleus (see below), so the physiological significance of the localization of the C23S mutant protein is not apparent. Localization of the C225S RING mutant was indistinguishable from wild-type GFP-Pib1p. We next examined localization of individual domains of Pib1p as fusions to GFP in wild-type cells (Fig. 4). GFP-Pib1(FYVE) (amino acids 1–88) localized similarly to full-length GFP-Pib1p, but there was slightly more vacuole membrane signal with GFP-Pib1(FYVE). The complementary construct, containing the linker and RING domains, localized to the cytosol. Thus, localization of Pib1p in vivo requires an intact FYVE domain (Fig. 4) and active Vps34 PtdIns 3-kinase (6Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 157-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), leading us to conclude that the FYVE domain is necessary and sufficient for localization of Pib1p to endosome and vacuole membranes containing PtdIns(3)P. As an independent test of localization of these constructs, strains expressing each of these constructs were subjected to subcellular fractionation, however, we found that all GFP fusion constructs fractionated predominantly in the 300 × glow speed pellet, precluding us from confirming these observations using a second experimental approach. For all GFP-based constructs, only a small amount of free GFP was observed by immunoblotting after cell fractionation (data not shown), indicating that localization of the GFP-Pib1p constructs observed by fluorescence microscopy in vivo is due predominantly to Pib1p sequences. These results suggest that the FYVE domain of Pib1p is solely responsible for targeting Pib1p to endosomal and vacuolar membranes. Localization of GFP-Pib1(FYVE) to endosomes and the vacuole membrane indicates that the cytoplasmic leaflets of these membranes contain PtdIns(3)P. Steady state localization of PtdIns(3)P within the cell by immunoelectron microscopy, using a FYVE domain from the human EEA1 protein for PtdIns(3)P detection, indicated that the majority of PtdIns(3)P is localized to the internal membranes of late endosomes and the lumen of the vacuole/lysosome (24Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). In yeast, most PtdIns(3)P is turned over within the lumen of the vacuole (25Wurmser A.E. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4930-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and it is likely that PtdIns(3)P is internalized to the vacuole lumen first by incorporation into internal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes and then delivery to the vacuole. In addition, PtdIns(3)P may be internalized from the vacuole membrane by a microautophagocytosis process in which lipid rich, protein-depleted regions of the vacuole membrane are internalized (26Muller O. Sattler T. Flotenmeyer M. Schwarz H. Plattner H. Mayer A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Because GFP signal from GFP-Pib1p constructs (Fig. 3) and from GFP-EEA1(FYVE) (6Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 157-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) was not observed in the vacuole, a mechanism must exist to prevent PtdIns(3)P-binding proteins from internalization into internal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes and the vacuole lumen. Comparison of the sequence of the carboxyl-terminal RING domain of Pib1p to other RING domains revealed that it is highly similar to RING domains found in proteins recently shown to function as E3 ubiquitin ligases (Fig.1). Importantly, the sequence of Pib1p contains several key residues, including a tryptophan residue conserved with human cbl oncoprotein, required for ubiquitin ligase activity (27Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of substrate proteins requires that ubiquitin be activated through a cascade of covalent transfers from ubiquitin activating enzyme, E1, to any of multiple ubiquitin carrier proteins called UBCs or E2s. Finally ubiquitin is transferred to a substrate protein. The presumed role of E3 ubiquitin ligases is to bind substrate proteins to be ubiquitinated and to present them to activated E2-ubiquitin. Ubiquitin ligase activity can be assessed in vitro using purified components. In these assays, ubiquitin ligase activity is promiscuous in that ubiquitin can be transferred to non-native substrates such as GST or GST-RING fusion proteins, and ubiquitin conjugates can be detected by immunoblotting with antibodies to ubiquitin (28Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 29Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Pib1p RING domain has ubiquitin ligase activity, in vitro assays employing recombinant E1 and E2 proteins, native ubiquitin, and GST-Pib1(RING) were carried out. Recombinant GST fusion proteins containing the Pib1p RING domain (amino acids 91–286), or a mutant RING domain (C225S) were tested for E3 ligase activity. As shown in Fig.5, GST-Pib1p(RING) exhibited ubiquitin ligase activity, as evidenced by the ladder of anti-ubiquitin-reactive material present in lane 1. In contrast, the RING mutant exhibited little activity (Fig. 5, compare lanes 1 and2). In reactions in which one component was omitted from the reaction, ubiquitin ligase activity by the GST-Pib1(RING) fusion protein was found to require ATP, E1, and E2. These results indicate that the Pib1p RING domain has E2-dependent E3 activity. What might the function of Pib1p be? E3 ubiquitin ligases are thought to function as adapter molecules which bind a target substrate protein and present it to the ubiquitination machinery. The crystal structure of a Cbl·UbcH7·ZAP-70 ternary complex, containing the Cbl RING domain, the UbcH7 E2 ubiquitin carrier protein, and a substrate peptide derived from ZAP-70, has been interpreted in this perspective (30Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The surface of Cbl, including the RING domain, makes contacts with both the substrate and the E2 and is postulated to direct the substrate polypeptide via a putative substrate-binding “channel” leading directly to the E2 active site (30Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). We speculate that Pib1p may mediate ubiquitination of endosomal and vacuolar proteins by binding the target protein and recruiting an as yet unidentified E2 enzyme. It is not yet known with which E2(s) Pib1p functions in vivo, but the results of the in vitro ubiquitination assays clearly indicate that it can use yeast Ubc4p (data not shown) and human Ubc5 (Fig. 4). In yeast, it is well established that single ubiquitin chains (monoubiquitin) attached to membrane proteins can serve as a targeting signal to sort these proteins to the vacuole (31Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). In contrast, polyubiquitin chains usually target proteins for degradation by the proteasome, although recent evidence suggest that polyubiquitin may also target Gap1p to the vacuole (32Helliwell S.B. Losko S. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 649-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that Pib1p may function in ubiquitin-dependent sorting of proteins to the vacuole, and is consistent with the fact that three of the five FYVE domain proteins encoded in the yeast genome, Vac1/Pep7p, Vps27p, and Fab1p, function in vacuole protein sorting pathways. To determine whether Pib1p functions in one or more known protein sorting pathways to the vacuole, we examined localization of multiple vacuolar proteins in a pib1Δ null mutant using several different methods. By pulse-chase analysis, no defects in the biosynthetic pathways which mediate vacuolar localization of newly synthesized carboxypeptidase Y, carboxypeptidase S, proteinase A, proteinase B, alkaline phosphatase, or aminopeptidase I were observed (data not shown). Moreover, steady state localization of carboxypeptidase S and vacuolar alkaline phosphatase were determined using well characterized GFP-carboxypeptidase S and GFP-alkaline phosphatase fusion genes which are localized to the vacuole of wild-type cells (10Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 20Cowles C.R. Odorizzi G. Payne G.S. Emr S.D. Cell. 1997; 91: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In pib1Δ cells, GFP-alkaline phosphatase was localized exclusively to the vacuole membrane, and GFP-carboxypeptidase S was localized exclusively to the vacuole lumen, exactly as in wild-type cells (data not shown). We also tested for kinetic defects in endocytic targeting of proteins to the vacuole in pib1Δ cells by determining degradation kinetics of Ste2p, Ste3p, Ste6p, Tat2p, and Gap1p. Each of these proteins functions at the plasma membrane, but is degraded within the lumen of the vacuole, and a defect in vacuolar sorting would be predicted to increase the half-life of each protein. For all cases, degradation rates in pib1Δ cells were indistinguishable compared with wild-type strains (data not shown). Finally, we also examined uptake of FM4-64, a fluorescent lipophilic tracer for bulk membrane endocytosis and did not observe any differences (compared with wild-type cells) in either the kinetics of uptake, or in the overall morphology of endocytic intermediates stained with the dye (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that Pib1p does not perform an essential role in sorting or trafficking of proteins to the vacuole, at least for the indicated proteins and the conditions used for these experiments. Importantly, at least two other ubiquitin ligases, Rsp5p and Rcy1p, function in post-Golgi sorting of proteins to the vacuole, so it is possible that the function of Pib1p is partially redundant with these proteins. Another possibility is that Pib1p targets non-native (e.g. damaged) proteins in endosomal and vacuolar membranes for degradation via the proteasome or the vacuole, as a component of an endosomal quality control system. The identification of Pib1p as a ubiquitin ligase highlights the role of the FYVE domain in intracellular targeting and may provide a molecular link for understanding the diverse roles of effectors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Stemmer W.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar), vaccine development (2Patten P.A. Howard R.J. Stemmer W.P. Curr. Opin.

Prog. 2000; 16: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In general, it involves fast mutation of the target gene(s), followed by an efficient screening or selection system for a desirable trait. Products with improved functions or novel compounds were generated using this approach (5Schmidt-Dannert C. Umeno D. Arnold F.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Directed evolution can also be used to generate desirable mutants from which sequence alternation can be correlated with function. In this study, we demonstrate an example of directed evolution for the alteration of product specificity. Analysis of point mutations sheds light on the mechanism determining the product specificity. Phytoene desaturase in eubacteria (crtI gene product) (6Armstrong G.A. Hearst J.E. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) is an important enzyme in the carotenoid pathway. It catalyzes the desaturation of phytoene to either neurosporene or lycopene (see Fig.1). Lycopene is a red pigment and an antioxidant that has been shown to have preventive effects against certain cancers (7Giovannucci E. Ascherio A. Rimm E.B. Stampfer M.J. Colditz G.A. Willett W.C. J. Nat. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 1767-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). The yellow carotenoid neurosporene is structurally different from lycopene by one double bond with one-step earlier termination in the desaturation reaction (see Fig. 1). These compounds are metabolites downstream from geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP)1 in the isoprenoid pathway via phytoene synthase encoded by crtB. About 10% of analyzed phytoene desaturases produce neurosporene, such as the enzymes from Rhodobacter, whereas the rest produce lycopene, such as in Agrobacterium aurantiacum (8Misawa N. Satomi Y. Kondo K. Yokoyama A. Kajiwara S. Saito T. Ohtani T. Miki W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6575-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), Erwinia sp. (9Misawa N. Nakagawa M. Kobayashi K. Yamano S. Izawa Y. Nakamura K. Harashima K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6704-6712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and other photosynthetic bacteria (10GarciaAsua G. Lang H.P. Cogdell R.J. Hunter C.N. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 445-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar). At the DNA level, thecrtI gene encoding phytoene desaturase of theRhodobacter species is significantly different from the ones from other organisms. Between the crtI genes ofRhodobacter and others, the amino acid sequence similarity is below 60% although there are some conserved regions, especially in the C-terminal domain (11Armstrong G.A. Alberti M. Leach F. Hearst J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Because it is highly distinct between these two classes of phytoene desaturases, it would be relatively difficult to perform DNA family shuffling (12Stemmer W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar) or other in vitrorecombination methods. Because these two types of phytoene desaturases share relatively low nucleotide identity or amino acid sequence similarity (below 60%), it cannot be deduced from a sequence comparison which are the residues that determine product specificity. Recently, Schmidt-Dannert et al. (5Schmidt-Dannert C. Umeno D. Arnold F.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) mutated Erwinia phytoene desaturase to produce a more desaturated compound, 3,4,3′,4′-tetradehydrolycopene (see Fig.1). To determine the amino acid residue(s) important for controlling product specificity in phytoene desaturases, we used error-prone PCR mutagenesis to evolve Rhodobacter sphaeroides phytoene desaturase to produce lycopene. The mutated amino acids were individually tested by site-directed mutagenesis for their importance in determining product specificity. The crtI gene encoding phytoene desaturase was cloned from R. sphaeroides ATCC17025, according to the published crtIsequence of another R. sphaeroides NCIB 8253 (13Lang H.P. Cogdell R.J. Gardiner A.T. Hunter C.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3859-3869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 1.7-kb crtI fragment was amplified from the genomic DNA using PCR with a pair of designed degenerate primers (5′-TGGGGTACCTGCATGTCATTCCTC-3′ and 5′-TGCTCTAGATCATTCCGCGGCAAG-3′). The PCR product was ligated into the pCR2.1® vector (Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA) by the TA-cloning technique and cotransformed into competent TOP10 host (Invitrogen, Inc.) with plasmid pCW18, which overexpresses the necessary enzymes for producing the substrate, phytoene, in Escherichia coli (Fig.1). The plasmid pCW18 is spectinomycin-resistant and harbors the dxs gene encoding 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase from E. coli, gps encoding GGPP synthase fromArchaeoglobus fulgidus (14Wang C.W. Oh M.K. Liao J.C. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 62: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and crtB encoding phytoene synthase from Erwinia uredovora on the vector pCL1920 (15Lerner C.G. Inouye M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This plasmid was constructed by destroying thecrtI gene on pCW9 (containing dxs,gps, and crtBI from E. uredovora) (16Farmer W.R. Liao J.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) with BamHI and then filled in the overhang and self-ligated. Among the yellow transformants due to the activity of the R. sphaeroides crtI gene, one was picked, and the plasmid harboringcrtI was isolated, sequenced, and designated as pCW19. The sequence of our cloned gene is 87% identical to the published one forR. sphaeroides NCIB 8253 (13Lang H.P. Cogdell R.J. Gardiner A.T. Hunter C.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3859-3869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at the nucleotide level and around 93% similar at the amino acid level. The plasmid pCW19 was found to contain the crtI-lacZα fusion with 10 amino acids (32 nucleotides) of crtI truncated at the C terminus (see Fig. 3A). However, the yellow pigment was confirmed to be neurosporene by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurement. Random mutagenesis of theR. sphaeroides crtI gene on the plasmid pCW19 was performed using methods described previously (17Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1994; 3: S136-S140Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). A pair of primers (5′-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA-3′ and 5′-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′) flanking the crtI gene on the pCR2.1 vector was designed to amplify the 1.7-kb crtI fragment by PCR under mutagenic conditions. The PCR products were purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) followed by digestion with the restriction enzymes HindIII and EcoRV. The fragments were cloned into the corresponding sites of vector pCR2.1 and transformed into competent TOP10/pCW18 cells. The colonies were grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) plates containing ampicillin (200 µg/ml) and spectinomycin (50 µg/ml) at 30 °C in the dark for 24 h (or until color developed). The colonies were first screened visually on the plates, and the ones with (slight) color change were cultured in liquid LB medium supplemented with the same antibiotics. The fermentation products were analyzed further by HPLC. The wild-type plasmid pCW19 was used as the template in the first generation of random mutagenesis. The mutant plasmid pCW19 m1 generated from the first round of directed evolution was used as the template in the second generation of random mutagenesis. A QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) site-directed mutagenesis kit was used. Various mutagenic primers were designed individually according to the desired mutations. The cycling parameters for the mutagenesis reactions were chosen based on the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. After PCR amplification by PfuTurbo DNA polymerase, the reaction mixture was digested with 10 units of the restriction enzyme DpnI for 1 h. Transformation of 10 µl of DpnI-treated reaction mixture into the competent cells yielded hundreds of colonies with the desired mutations. After the cells were centrifuged, carotenoids were extracted from the pellets by 30:70 methanol-MTBE (methyltert-butylether). The extracts were filtered through Sep-Pak cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA), eluted with the same solvent and characterized using an Alliance HPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA) equipped with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. A 20-µl aliquot of extract was injected into the CarotenoidTM column (2.0 × 150 mm, 3 µm; YMC, Inc., Wilmington, NC), and eluted with methanol-MTBE (30:70, isocratic) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Similar to the two-plasmid system in our previous work (4Wang C. Oh M.K. Liao J.C. Biotechnol. Prog. 2000; 16: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we cloned the target crtI gene from R. sphaeroides ATCC17025 on one plasmid and the rest of the pathway genes (dxs, gps, and crtB) onto another compatible plasmid (pCW18). Random mutations were introduced to the crtI gene by PCR under mutagenic conditions. The 1.7-kb PCR fragment contains the upstream promoter region, the open reading frame of the crtI gene, and the downstream region. After mutation, restriction digestion, purification, and re-ligation, the plasmid DNA was transformed into the host strain TOP10 containing pCW18. The colonies were grown on plates to screen for different colors due to the accumulation of different carotenoids. Approximately 7,500 colonies were screened on the plates visually for the first generation of directed evolution. The E. coli cells expressing the wild-type R. sphaeroides phytoene desaturase appeared deep yellow. One colony showed a color change from yellow to slightly golden. This candidate mutant was grown in LB medium with the appropriate antibiotics, and the products were identified by HPLC. Results showed that this mutant strain produced a mixture of carotenoids, including neurosporene (45%), lycopene (32%), and some amounts of ζ-carotene (Fig.2A). The plasmid harboring the mutated crtI gene was isolated and designated as pCW19 m1. We proceeded to perform the next mutagenesis by error-prone PCR using pCW19 m1 as a template. About 10,000 colonies were screened, and their colors were compared with the control harboring pCW19 m1. Twenty colonies showed a color change, and two of them appeared completely pink. These two mutants were grown in LB medium with antibiotics, and the carotenoids produced were subjected to HPLC analysis. Both mutants produced a mixture of carotenoids with the majority being lycopene (77 and 78%) and small amounts of neurosporene (20 and 16%) and ζ-carotene (3 and 6%) (Fig. 2A). The two plasmids harboring the mutated crtI genes from the second mutant generation were isolated and designated as pCW19 m2 and pCW19 m3, respectively. The three mutants m1, m2, and m3 were sequenced. Three point mutations were found on m1. Two of them led to the amino acid changes, F220S and E508G, whereas the third one caused the early truncation of the protein by changing the amino acid arginine into a stop codon (see Fig. 3Aand Table I). Three pairs of mutagenic primers for site-directed mutagenesis were designed to investigate the effect of each point mutation. We found the change to stop codon caused the most significant change to product distribution (Fig.2B), followed by E508G, and the mutation F220S had no effect on product distribution. These results are summarized in Table I and shown schematically in Fig. 3B.Table IList of the R. sphaeroides phytoene desaturase mutants generated by random and site-directed mutagenesisGeneParental templateDNA mutationAmino acid mutationLycopene production (%)m1WTT659CF220S39A1523GE508GA1540TR514stop(opal)G1.1WTT659CF220S0G1.2WTA1523GE508G10G1.3WTA1540TR514stop(opal)21m2m1T36AH12Q80T203AV68DT496AF166IT1205CM402TG2.1m1T36AH12Q37G2.2m1T203AV68D53G2.3m1T496AF166I65G2.4m1T1205CM402T23G3.1G2.2T496AF166I82m3m1T443AL148H82T1086AL362LG1524AG508GG2.5m1T443AL148H79G2.6m1T1086AL362L37G2.7m1G1524AG508G37G1.4WTT443AL148H53G3.2m2T443AL148H90G4.1G3.1T443AL148H89WT represents the wild type, and the stop codon opal is TGA. Only the DNA and amino acid changes from the parental template are listed. Open table in a new tab WT represents the wild type, and the stop codon opal is TGA. Only the DNA and amino acid changes from the parental template are listed. Four additional point mutations were found in mutant m2 compared with the parental template (m1), which lead to four amino acid changes, H12Q, V68D, F166I, and M402T. Again, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to determine the effect of each point mutation. We found that V68D and F166I were the two beneficial mutations that help the conversion of product from neurosporene to lycopene (see Fig.2C and Fig. 3B). The mutation H12Q has little effect, whereas M402T has a negative effect on percent lycopene production. Mutant m3 has three additional point mutations compared with the m1 template, including one amino acid change, L148H, and two silent mutations that cause no amino acid changes. We verified the effect of L148H by introducing this mutation into m1 by site-directed mutagenesis and, as expected, found that it increased the production of lycopene dramatically to about 80%. Moreover, we also introduced this mutation alone into the wild-type template pCW19, and the effect is also prominent (52% lycopene) (Fig. 2D). Based on the information obtained from two generations of directed evolution by random mutagenesis, we know that several amino acid changes were beneficial for achieving higher production of lycopene. The two final mutants generated from random mutagenesis, m2 and m3, showed nearly no difference in color compared with the positive control harboring pCW9 that overexpressed the lycopene-producing CrtI from E. uredovora (16Farmer W.R. Liao J.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), although they still synthesize small amounts of neurosporene. Thus, this visual limitation hinders the further use of color screening to isolate the next-generation mutants by evolution. However, we can resort to site-directed mutagenesis based on information generated from directed evolution. Our results showed that L148H had the most significant positive effect among all the mutations, followed by F166I, R514Stop, V68D, and E508G. On the other hand, M402T had a negative effect for lycopene production whereas F220S and H12Q have negligible effects. To optimize lycopene production, we then combined all the positive mutations and eliminated negative mutations by site-directed mutagenesis. First, L148H was introduced into the mutant m2, because it does not have this mutation, and its lycopene production is already high (80%). The result showed that L148H further increased the lycopene production up to 90% (see Fig. 2Dand Fig. 3B). We suspected that we could further increase the production by removing the negative mutation M402T. To do so, we started from the mutant m1 and introduced mutations V68D and F116I and found the lycopene production of this strain was just slightly higher than that of m2 or m3. Finally, we incorporated L148H into the above strain, and its lycopene production level was around 90% (Fig. 3B). Note that this level of lycopene production was achieved with or without the negative mutation M402T. It appears that the negative effect was compensated by multiple positive mutations. In this work, we evolved the R. sphaeroides phytoene desaturase to change its product from neurosporene to lycopene. We used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the relative importance of each mutation to product specificity and combined the positive mutations. By combining error-prone PCR and site-directed mutagenesis, we changed the neurosporene-producing enzyme to lycopene-producing. We conclude that there are two important regions of this enzyme in determining the product distribution from neurosporene to lycopene. One is in the C-terminal region; the other is close to the N terminus (Val68, Phe166, and Leu148) that may contain the substrate-binding motifs. Although many carotenoid biosynthetic genes have been cloned from various organisms, no crystal structures of these enzymes, including phytoene desaturase, are available so far. Previously, the hydrophobic C-terminal domain of the phytoene desaturase was identified to be conserved among carotenoid desaturases and required for the interaction in the dehydrogenation reaction (11Armstrong G.A. Alberti M. Leach F. Hearst J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Schmidt-Dannert et al.(5Schmidt-Dannert C. Umeno D. Arnold F.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) also showed that one point mutation in this domain changes product distribution. Sequence analysis of our mutant m1 showed two positive mutations near this C-terminal hydrophobic domain. The major one introduced a stop codon; the other caused the amino acid change E508G. The crtI genes of Rhodobacter sp. are longer in the C terminus compared with those of the organisms that produce lycopene. Thus, the C-terminal domain appears to be important in stopping the desaturation process at the level of neurosporene. Without this domain, the desaturation process continues to lycopene. From the number of the colonies in the screening process, we noticed that it is relatively difficult to obtain a positive mutant in the first generation of random mutagenesis. It may be because of mutating a larger fragment (1.7-kb) by error-prone PCR, the use of the color screening system, or the rigidity of the enzyme. Once a mutant was obtained, several positive mutants appeared in the second generation of directed evolution. We were able to achieve nearly 100% of product conversion by two generations of directed evolution without affecting the overall enzyme activity. The mutants generated from the second mutagenesis process give us more information on the (primary) structure-function relationship of this enzyme. The mutant m2 has two positive mutations, V68D and F166I, and m3 has only one beneficial mutation, L148H, in addition to their parent template, m1. The R. sphaeroides CrtI protein sequence was compared against the Conserved Domain data base on the NCBI website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/structure/cdd/cdd.shtml). Interestingly, we found that five other phytoene desaturases that produce lycopene, including the ones from E. uredovora,Erwinia herbicola, A. aurantiacum,Flavobacterium sp. ATCC21588, and Erythrobacter longus, all have aspartate around position 68 of this protein from the multiple sequence alignment. The other phytoene desaturases that do not produce lycopene, such as Rhodobacter sp., have Val, Leu, or Met. We also noticed that the second beneficial mutation on m2, F166I, falls into one of the flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding sequence motifs (Fig. 3A), which belong to the class of glutathione reductase (20Dym O. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1712-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, the other two beneficial mutations, V68D and L148H, are in the regions that are not identified previously to be associated with any properties. We suspect that these two amino acid residues may be in the domains that are involved in the substrate binding. Further investigation of these mutations would elucidate the mechanisms that determine product specificity.

M., ed) in press, Academic Press, San Diego.Google Scholar). The complexity of this process derives partly from cellular changes that occur during gamete interactions. Spermatozoa undergo physiological changes in the female reproductive tract that are required for fertilization and are collectively called capacitation (1Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar,3Jaiswal, B. S., and Eisenbach, M. (2002) inFertilization (Hardy, D. M., ed) in press, Academic Press, San Diego.Google Scholar). Although the molecular basis of capacitation is only partly understood, in some if not all species avidity of sperm-ZP adhesion increases as capacitation progresses. After capacitation is completed, the membranes involved in initial adhesion events are lost from the sperm surface during the acrosome reaction, but adhesion is sustained by interaction of newly exposed structures with the ZP (1Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar, 2Bi, M., Wassler, M. J., and Hardy, D. M. (2002) inFertilization (Hardy, D. M., ed) in press, Academic Press, San Diego.Google Scholar). Unique adhesion molecule pairs likely function at different times during fertilization, and the activities of these molecules may change as fertilization progresses (2Bi, M., Wassler, M. J., and Hardy, D. M. (2002) inFertilization (Hardy, D. M., ed) in press, Academic Press, San Diego.Google Scholar). It is therefore important to assess the biochemical and functional properties of sperm adhesion molecules at each stage in the fertilization process. Several sperm proteins that may mediate adhesion to the ZP have been identified and characterized (2Bi, M., Wassler, M. J., and Hardy, D. M. (2002) inFertilization (Hardy, D. M., ed) in press, Academic Press, San Diego.Google Scholar). Among these molecules zonadhesin is unique in its ability to bind directly and in a species-specific manner to native, particulate ZP (4Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol.

In each of these species, the large extracellular region of the protein comprises primarily three domain types (meprin/A5 antigen/mu receptor tyrosine phosphatase, mucin, and von Willebrand D (VWD)) that are present in other adhesion molecules (8Beckmann G. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 40-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 9Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the domain structures of zonadhesin from these four mammals have been predicted from cDNA sequences, relatively little is known about the biochemical and functional properties of the proteins. The active form of pig zonadhesin in membrane fractions of capacitated, epididymal spermatozoa is a two-chain molecule with disulfide-bondedMr 105,000 and 45,000 polypeptides, both of which are derived from a predicted 2467-amino acid nascent precursor (4Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19000-19004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26025-26028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). High Mr forms of zonadhesin have also been observed, suggesting the possible formation of covalent oligomers (4Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19000-19004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This possibility was further implied by the presence in the pig zonadhesin D1, D2, and D3 domains of a conserved CG(L/V)CG sequence motif (5Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26025-26028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) that is important for the oligomerization and proper function of von Willebrand factor (11Mayadas T.N. Wagner D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3531-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and for the oligomerization of porcine submaxillary mucin (12Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31751-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that the protein at a minimum undergoes limited proteolysis and possibly also oligomerization as occurs in the functional maturation of vWF and other D-domain proteins (10Wagner D.D. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unclear when during sperm maturation such post-translational processing occurs or whether it is important for the ZP binding activity of zonadhesin. Here we report that heterogeneous post-translational processing gives rise to multiple isoforms of pig zonadhesin in freshly ejaculated spermatozoa. Among these, only forms comprising the p105 and p45 polypeptides possess ZP binding activity, and the monomeric p105/45 form binds more avidly than do higher order covalent oligomers. Furthermore, we find that zonadhesin binds uniformly to homologous ZP and localizes to the apical head of pig spermatozoa. These properties further support a function for zonadhesin in sperm adhesion to the extracellular matrix of the egg. Boar spermatozoa in extended, freshly ejaculated semen were washed and immediately disrupted by N2 cavitation at 650 p.s.i. (15Haden N.P. Hickox J.R. Scott W.C. Hardy D.M. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Particulate fractions enriched in sperm plasma membranes were isolated from suspensions of disrupted cells by differential centrifugation (15Haden N.P. Hickox J.R. Scott W.C. Hardy D.M. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) as for previous studies with cauda epididymal spermatozoa (4Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol.

Solutions for sperm fractionations were buffered at pH 7.5 and contained EDTA (1 mm) and diisopropyl fluorophosphate (1 mm) to prevent proteolysis by acidic proteases, Ca2+-dependent metalloproteinases, or serine proteases, respectively. In some experiments, solutions also contained 1 mm iodoacetamide to inhibit thiol proteases and to prevent thiol oxidation. Isolated membrane fractions in 20 mm NaHEPES, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 (HNE), were stored at −70 °C. Porcine ZP were isolated from sliced ovaries by stepwise sieving through screens (16Dunbar B.S. Wardrip N.J. Hedrick J.L. Biochemistry. 1980; 2: 356-365Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and then further purified by ultracentrifugation through Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gradients (4Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19000-19004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated ZP in HNE were stored at −70 °C. Detergent-solubilized proteins from sperm membrane fractions were mixed with isolated ZP, and zonadhesin that bound directly to the particulate, native ZP was detected either by Western blotting (4Hardy D.M.

For localization of binding sites, sperm proteins were biotinylated (4Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19000-19004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) prior to solubilization and incubation with ZP. The ZP with bound sperm proteins were washed extensively with 20 mm NaHEPES, 0.5m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5 (mRIPA) (4Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19000-19004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then bound, biotinylated proteins were detected by incubating for 15 min at 22 °C with Texas Red-labeled streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted 10,000-fold in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.5 (TBST). After washing three times for 5 min with TBST, ZP were dropped on coverslips, air dried, mounted with Fluoromount G (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA), and viewed by epifluorescence. ZP-bound forms of zonadhesin were characterized by Western blotting. Biotinylated zonadhesin polypeptides that remained bound to ZP after washing with mRIPA were detected by probing blots with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (4Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19000-19004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, zonadhesin polypeptides that remained bound after washing with 1% CHAPS/HNE were detected by probing blots with specific antisera as described below. The 1.7-kilobase EcoRI fragment of pig zonadhesin cDNA clone M2 (in pBluescript) was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pET-23d. The 5′ sticky end of this fragment came from theEcoRI site in the adapter used to construct the cDNA library (5Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26025-26028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and its 3′ sticky end came from the EcoRI site at nucleotides 4063–4068 of the zonadhesin composite cDNA (GenBankTM accession number U40024). This construct specified an Mr 64,000 fusion protein comprising 20 amino acids of N-terminal vector-encoded protein, 19 amino acids of C-terminal vector-encoded protein (including a hexahistidine tag), and zonadhesin amino acids Pro683–Ser1224. The fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21/DE3 by induction with 0.5 mm isopropylthiogalactoside for 2 h at 37 °C and isolated from inclusion bodies by preparative SDS-PAGE and electroelution. Asp-Pro bonds of the purified D0-D1 fusion protein were hydrolyzed for 36 h with 70% formic acid at 37 °C. The final hydrolysates contained a mixture of proteins with Mr values corresponding to partial hydrolysis products predicted from the deduced amino acid sequence, including an Mr 33,000 core polypeptide. Hydrolysates were lyophilized to remove formic acid prior to injection. Two female New Zealand White rabbits were immunized (intramuscular) with 0.2–0.5 mg of protein each in 1 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant (day 0). Booster injections (intramuscular) on day 45 consisted of 0.2–0.5 mg of protein each in 1 ml of Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Antisera were recovered from blood obtained by terminal exsanguinations on day 58. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins comprising in part amino acids Ser923–Met993 of the D1 domain or amino acids Ile1684–Pro1788 of the D3 domain were expressed in E. coli strain BL21. Polymerase chain reaction products (D1 sense primer, 5′-AGTGGATCCAGCACCTTCTCTGG-3′; D1 antisense primer, 5′-ATAGAATTCTGCTAGGCCGTGTTG-3′; D3 sense primer, 5′-CATCGGATCCCAGGTCAAGTTTGACGG-3′; and D3 antisense primer, 5′-GGGGAATTCTAGGCCGCCTG-3′; underlined bases denote mismatches introduced to create restriction sites and stop codons) encoding the D1 and D3 domain segments were directionally cloned into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pGEX-2T, and fusion protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing the bacteria with 10 mmNaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS), soluble fusion proteins were extracted by sonicating cell pellets in PBS containing 0.5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1.0 mm EDTA, 10 mm E64, and 0.2% Triton X-100. Cell lysates were applied to a glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose column (15 ml of bed volume) equilibrated at 22 °C in PBS. Nonbinding proteins were washed through with PBS, and fusion proteins were eluted with 5 mm GSH in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Eluted fusion proteins were present at concentrations of 5–8 mg/ml in the pooled, peak fractions, and with prior disulfide bond reduction migrated as single bands in SDS-PAGE (10% gels). Total yields of purified fusion protein were 40–45 mg/500 ml of culture. Four female New Zealand White rabbits were immunized (intramuscular) with 1 mg of purified fusion protein/animal (two with GST-D1 and two with GST-D3) emulsified in 0.5 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant (day 0). Booster injections consisted of 1 mg of purified fusion protein/animal emulsified in 0.5 ml of Freund's incomplete adjuvant (intramuscular) on day 42, and 1 mg of soluble protein/animal in PBS (subcutaneous) on days 49 and 70. Antisera were recovered from blood obtained by terminal exsanguinations on day 81. Purified GST (100 mg), GST-D1 (70 mg), and GST-D3 (70 mg) were dialyzed at 4 °C for >16 h in 0.1 mNaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3, to remove GSH and exchange into conjugation buffer. Dialyzed proteins were each coupled at 10 mg/ml swelled gel to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing by suction on a glass filter to remove uncoupled proteins, the remaining activated groups were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine, and the conjugated resins were washed with three cycles of alternating pH (0.1 m acetate, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 4.0, and 0.1 mNaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3). The affinity matrices were poured into 1-cm-diameter glass columns, equilibrated in PBS containing 0.02% NaN3, and then stored at 4 °C. Antibodies to GST were removed by passing 20 ml of antisera through a 10-ml bed volume GST-Sepharose column equilibrated at 22 °C in PBS. Antibodies to zonadhesin D1 or D3 domains were then affinity purified from their anti-GST-depleted sera by chromatography on GST-D1 or GST-D3 columns, respectively (7 ml of bed volume each, equilibrated in PBS at 22 °C). Elution of bound antibodies with 0.2 m sodium citrate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 3.0, was monitored continuously byA280. Peak fractions were pooled and immediately adjusted to pH 7 by addition of 1 m Tris (unbuffered). Antibodies to GST that were removed in the initial depletion steps were similarly eluted from GST-Sepharose and recovered for use as affinity-purified control antibodies. All purified antibodies were stored at −70 °C. 20 mg of affinity-purified antibody to the D3 domain (11.4 mg from rabbit R128 and 8.6 mg from rabbit R129) were desalted into 0.1 mNaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3 (coupling buffer) in two runs on four tandem 5-ml HiTrap desalting columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Desalted protein (15 mg in 8.8 ml) was coupled to 0.43 g (dry weight) of freshly swollen CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. A protein assay of uncoupled protein confirmed that more than 95% of the antibody (>14.5 mg) was coupled to the affinity matrix (1.5 ml of packed volume), which after blocking and washing as for the fusion protein affinity matrices was equilibrated in PBS containing 0.02% NaN3 and stored at 4 °C. Sperm membrane fractions (100 mg protein) were Dounce homogenized in 10 ml of 1% SDS/HNE and incubated for 30 min at 22 °C. The homogenate was diluted to 100 ml with HNE containing 0.5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 0.56% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 1.1% (v/v) hydrogenated Triton X-100 to produce the composition of mRIPA, a detergent solution in which zonadhesin retains its ZP binding activity (4Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19000-19004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 2 °C, up to 50 ml of the supernatant solution (mRIPA extract) was applied to a 1.5-ml anti-D3 column, and nonbound proteins were washed through with mRIPA untilA280 (monitored continuously) returned to base line. The column was further washed with 10 ml of HNE containing 1% (v/v) hydrogenated Triton X-100, and then the protein was eluted with 10 ml of 0.2 m sodium citrate, 0.15 mNaCl, 1% (v/v) hydrogenated Triton X-100, pH 3.0. Eluted protein fractions containing purified zonadhesin were pooled, adjusted to pH 7 with 1 m Tris (unbuffered), and stored at −70 °C. Two female New Zealand White rabbits were immunized (intradermal) with 100 µg of purified zonadhesin holoprotein/animal emulsified in 1 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant (day 0). After boosting with 100 µg of purified protein/animal emulsified in 1.2 ml of Freund's incomplete adjuvant (intramuscular) on day 45, antisera were recovered from blood obtained by terminal exsanguinations on day 60. Mutations in the pGEX-2T construct encoding GST-D3 were introduced with T4 polymerase-based GeneEditor (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and those in the construct encoding GST-D1 were introduced with polymerase chain reaction-based QuickChange (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) without modification of the vendor's instructions. The primer for generating the double Cys → Ser mutant of the 1709CGVCG1713 motif in GST-D3 (C1709S,C1712S) was 5′-ACGGAAGGACCTCCGGCGTGAGCGGGAACTTCA-3′ (altered bases in mutagenesis primer sequences are underlined). Primers for generating mutants of the933CGLCG937 motif in GST-D1 were: 5′-CTCTGGCAAACTCTCTGGTCTCTGTGGCG-3′ (C933S sense); 5′-CGCCACAGAGACCAGAGAGTTTGCCAGAG-3′ (C933S antisense); 5′-CTCTGTGGTCTCAGTGGCGACTATGACGG-3′ (C936S sense); 5′-CCGTCATAGTCGCCACTGAGACCACAGAG-3′ (C936S antisense); 5′-CTCTGGCAAACTCTCTGGTCTCAGTGGCGACTATG-3′ (C933S,C936S sense); and 5′-CATAGTCGCCACTGAGACCAGAGAGTTTGCCAGAG-3′ (C933S,C936S antisense). Mutated constructs were verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing using insert-flanking pGEX primers (sense: 5′-AATCGGATCTGGTTCCG-3′; antisense: 5′-CGTCAGTCAGTCACGAT-3′). Mutant fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 cells and purified by GSH affinity chromatography as for the wild type proteins. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were done as described previously (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar, 18Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc.

Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE was also done as described previously (4Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19000-19004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that gradient gels (4–12% linear) were used for each dimension to resolve both high Mr zonadhesin isoforms and their constituent polypeptides. Dilutions used to detect zonadhesin on Western blots of pig sperm membranes were: D0-D1 antisera, 1:50,000; D1 antibody, 1:5,000; D3 antibody, 1:50,000; holoprotein antisera, 1:50,000, each in TBST. Bound antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA) diluted 1:50,000 in TBST and development by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal; Pierce). Wild type and mutant fusion proteins were purified by GSH affinity chromatography in the presence of 1 mm DTT to stabilize the expressed proteins in their monomeric forms. The purified fusion proteins were then desalted on Sephadex G50 spin columns equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm DTT. For time course studies, oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was added to desalted fusion protein (1 µg in Tris-DTT) to a final concentration of 25 mm, which upon reaction with DTT produced a 24 mm GSSG/2 mm GSH redox buffer with an effective potential in solution (Eh) at pH 7.4 of −246 mV. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and disulfide bond formation was terminated at various times by adding iodoacetamide to 60 mm. To determine dependence of multimer formation onEh, 5–25 mm GSSG was added to reactions to produce redox buffers ranging from −269 to −246 mV Eh. After incubating for 2 h at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated with iodoacetamide as for time course studies. Multimers in the terminated reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by staining with Coomassie Blue. All steps for immunolocalization experiments were done at 22 °C. Spermatozoa were recovered from pig epididymides and washed with HEPES-buffered medium as described previously (4Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19000-19004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, the cells were smeared on coverslips, air dried, and then fixed in methanol for 30 min. After blocking 30 min with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated goat serum in PBS, the coverslips were floated 1 h on D0-D1 antisera diluted 1:400 in PBS/heat-inactivated goat serum. After washing coverslips with PBS, bound antibody was detected by incubating for 1 h with Texas Red-conjugated antibody to rabbit immunoglobulin (BIOSOURCE International) diluted 1:400 in PBS/heat-inactivated goat serum. After a final wash with PBS, coverslips were mounted with Fluoromount G and viewed by epifluorescence and phase contrast microscopy. Zonadhesin from membrane fractions of capacitated, epididymal spermatozoa bound directly and with high affinity to intact ZP (Fig.1). The bound zonadhesin comprised p105 and p45 polypeptides (Fig. 1a) as previously observed (4Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19000-19004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although earlier work established the species specificity of this interaction, the distribution of zonadhesin-binding sites in the pig ZP has not been characterized. We therefore visualized ZP-bound zonadhesinin situ by affinity fluorescence (Fig. 1, b andc). Zonadhesin protein was detected on the entire ZP, indicating that its binding sites were not regionalized in the ZP structure. In addition, the relative evenness of the labeling suggested that the binding sites are intrinsic to the ZP and not associated with adherent materials from the cumulus cell matrix or other potential contaminants of the ZP preparation. The locations of p105 and p45 tryptic peptides in the sequence of the pig zonadhesin precursor indicated that p45 comprises in part the D1 domain and that p105 comprises in part the D2 and D3 domains (ref. (5Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26025-26028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and Fig. 2). To detect zonadhesin isoforms in spermatozoa and to characterize their polypeptide compositions, we prepared various domain-directed antisera and affinity-purified antibodies. The deduced sequence of the precursor specified numerous potentially antigenic regions, including segments located in approximately the same positions within the D1 and D3 domains that exhibited high predicted hydrophilicity, surface probability, and flexibility (Fig. 2). Accordingly, we raised antisera to a Gene 10 fusion protein spanning the D0 and D1 domains (Pro683–Ser1224), as well as to two GST fusion proteins comprising in part the short, antigenic segments identified in the D1 and D3 domains (Ser923–Met993 and Ile1684–Pro1788, respectively; Figs. 2 and3). We also raised antisera to whole zonadhesin isolated from membrane fractions of pig spermatozoa (Fig.3).Figure 3Production and characterization of zonadhesin antisera and antibodies.a, preparation and specificity of antisera and antibodies to recombinant fusion proteins. Shown are protein stains and Western blots of SDS-PAGE (10% gels, protein disulfides reduced) as indicated. Purified, recombinant zonadhesin fusion proteins (lanes labeled G10-D0D1-H6 (where “H6” indicates a His6 tag), GST-D1, andGST-D3) each migrated primarily as single, Coomassie Blue-stained bands in overloaded gels. To generate the immunogen for production of antisera to the D0-D1 domains, the purified Gene 10 fusion protein spanning Pro683–Ser1224 of pig zonadhesin (lane labeled G10-D0D1-H6) was partially hydrolyzed at Asp-Pro bonds (lane labeledDP-hydrolyzed). The three predominant bands visible in the hydrolyzed preparation (asterisks) corresponded to Pro724–Asp1191 (51,500 Da; top band), a mixture of Pro724–Asp1107 and Pro807–Asp1191 (42,500 and 42,300 Da, respectively; middle band), and Pro807–Asp1107 (33,200 Da; bottom band). GST fusion proteins (lanes labeledGST-D1 and GST-D3) were used to prepare affinity-purified antibodies to segments spanning Ser923–Met993 of the pig zonadhesin D1 domain and Ile1684–Pro1788 of the D3 domain. Specificity of the antisera and antibodies was determined by Western blotting mixtures of the fusion proteins. Arrowheads mark the locations of the three fusion proteins in a mixture of 50 ng of each partially pure protein (lane labeled Silver stain). Note"

Mutations identical to the germinal activating mutations found in severe skeletal dysplasias have been identified in certain types of cancer: at low frequency in multiple myeloma and cervix carcinoma and at high frequency in bladder carcinoma. We analysed, by SSCP and sequencing, the prevalence of FGFR3 mutations in 116 primary tumours of various types (upper aerodigestive tract, oesophagus, stomach, lung and skin). The regions analysed encompassed all FGFR3 point mutations previously described in severe skeletal dysplasia and cancers. No mutations were detected in the tumour types examined, suggesting that FGFR3 mutations are restricted to a few tumour types, the evidence to date suggesting that they are very specific to bladder carcinomas."

Paragangliomas of the central nervous system are very rare, occur almost exclusively in the cauda equina of the spinal cord and are considered non-familial. In the present study, we screened 22 apparently sporadic paragangliomas of the cauda equina for SDHD mutations. One spinal paraganglioma and similar cerebellar tumours that developed 22 years later in the same patient contained a missense mutation at codon 12 (GGT→AGT, Gly→Ser) and a silent mutation at codon 68 (AGC→AGT, Ser→Ser). There was no family history of paragangliomas but DNA from white blood cells of this patient showed the same sequence alterations, indicating the presence of a germline mutation. All other cases of spinal paraganglioma had the wild-type SDHD sequence, except one case with a silent mutation at codon 68 (AGC→AGT, Ser→Ser). This is the first observation indicating that inherited SDHD mutations may occasionally cause the development of paragangliomas in the central nervous system."

The subcellular localization of IRS-1 is controversial, with some reports suggesting association with the cytoskeleton and other studies reporting membrane localization. In this study, we used immunofluorescence microscopy to define the localization of IRS-1. In the basal state, recombinant IRS-1 was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. In response to insulin, recombinant IRS-1 translocated to the plasma membrane. We have also studied the localization of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins. Unlike native IRS-1, a fusion protein containing GFP plus full-length IRS-1 appeared to localize in inclusion bodies. In contrast, when GFP was fused to the N terminus of IRS-1 (i.e. the pleckstrin homology and phosphotyrosine-binding domains), this fusion protein was targeted to the plasma membrane. Mutations of phosphoinositide-binding sites in both the pleckstrin homology and phosphotyrosine-binding domains significantly reduced the ability of Myc-tagged IRS-1 to translocate to the plasma membrane following insulin stimulation.

Ligand binding to the extracellular domain of the IR activates its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, resulting in autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of other intracellular proteins, including IRS molecules and SHC (1White M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS molecules then activate various SH2 domain-containing molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Grb2, SHP2, and Nck (1White M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Thus, IRS molecules initiate a PI3K-mediated cascade leading to GLUT4 translocation. Although both insulin and platelet-derived growth factor receptors are able to activate PI3K, only insulin-stimulated activation of PI3K leads to the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 from intracellular vesicles to the cell surface in both 3T3-L1 cells and adipocytes (2Isakoff S.J.

It has been hypothesized that IRS molecules and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor recruit PI3K to distinct locations (3Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 121-125Google Scholar). Thus, differential recruitment of PI3K may be responsible for the ability of insulin, but not platelet-derived growth factor, to stimulate GLUT4 translocation. All IRS molecules contain both a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain. PH domains have been shown to be important both for plasma membrane targeting (4Razzini G. Ingrosso A. Brancaccio A. Sciacchitano S. Esposito D.L. Falasca M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 823-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and for ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation by the IR (5Shaw G. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). PTB domains specifically bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins at NPXpY motifs. The PTB/NPXpY interaction is required for the binding of IRS molecules to the IR following insulin-stimulated IR activation. Interestingly, the β-strands of the IRS-1 PTB domain superimpose on the framework of a PH domain, suggesting that the IRS-1 PTB domain may be a type of PH domain (6Harrison S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 341-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In support of this, Takeuchi et al. (7Takeuchi H. Matsuda M. Yamamoto T. Kanematsu T. Kikkawa U. Yagisawa H. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Biochem.

Many PH domain-containing molecules have been shown to translocate to the plasma membrane in response to insulin stimulation, e.g.protein kinase B, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase downstream of IRS-1 in the insulin signaling pathway; phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, which regulates protein kinase B; and Gab1, a Grb2-associated protein that functions downstream of multiple growth factor receptors (8Sable C.L.

A. 1999; 96: 8378-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This binding occurs primarily in response to growth factor stimulation either by causing a conformational change in the protein or by changing the composition of phosphoinositides in the membrane bilayer (13Rameh L.E.

Thus, it has been hypothesized that IRS-1 might translocate to the plasma membrane following insulin stimulation. In this study, we have investigated the role of the PH and PTB domains both in the subcellular localization of IRS-1 and in insulin signaling. By mutating predicted phosphoinositide-binding sites in the IRS-1 N terminus, we demonstrated the contribution of these domains to the plasma membrane targeting of full-length IRS-1. We found that mutation of either the PH or PTB domain significantly reduced the ability of IRS-1 to translocate to the plasma membrane. However, these same mutations did not significantly affect the ability of IRS-1 to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin. This raises the possibility that association of IRS-1 with the plasma membrane may not be required for tyrosine phosphorylation. Indeed, it is possible that tyrosine phosphorylation may occur prior to plasma membrane translocation. cDNA constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of either full-length IRS-1 or IRS-1 regions (PH domain, amino acids 1–113; PTB domain, amino acids 107–335; and N terminus, amino acids 1–262) using human IRS-1 cDNA (14Quon M.J.

Polymerase chain reaction was carried out using high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and primers with appropriate restriction sites were incorporated as needed. Polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO using a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), followed by subcloning into pcDNA3.1Myc, pEGFPN2, or pEGFPN3 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with the appropriate restriction enzymes. All cDNA constructs were sequenced using a BigDyeTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction DNA sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and an Applied Biosystems Prism 377 DNA automatic sequencer. 2The detailed cloning strategies for these constructs are available upon request. The IRS-1 R28C mutation was made using a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutagenesis was carried out on the human full-length IRS-1 cDNA. Introduction of a Myc epitope tag into IRS-1 R28C was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction amplification of IRS-1 cDNA, followed by TA cloning and subcloning into pcDNA3.1Myc. Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing the constructs using the BigDyeTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction DNA sequencing kit and the Applied Biosystems Prism 377 DNA automatic sequencer. The IRS-1 3KQ triple mutation (K169Q/K171Q/K177Q) was made by the method of Higuchi et al. (15Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar). The resulting amplified cDNA containing the 3KQ mutations was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO using the TOPO TA cloning kit and subcloned into either full-length IRS-1 or IRS-1 R28C in pcDNA3.1MycHisA with AscI andSacII. Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing the constructs using the BigDyeTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction DNA sequencing kit and the Applied Biosystems Prism 377 DNA automatic sequencer. The primary antibodies used included anti-IRS-1 (C20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-c-Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The secondary antibodies used included fluorescein-, rhodamine-, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). COS-7 cells were seeded on two-chamber glass slides (Lab-Tek II chamber slide, Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml and transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 3 µl of Fugene 6 and 1 µg of plasmid DNA were mixed and incubated in 100 µl of Opti-MEM serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 15 min before being added to cells in antibiotic-free medium. After 48 h, cells were fixed in 2% Formalin in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) for 15 min, washed twice with DPBS, and incubated with DPBS and 10% fetal bovine serum for 5 min. Slides were then placed in a humidified 15-cm dish with water-soaked 3-mm paper and incubated with primary antibody as indicated at a dilution of 1:200 in DPBS, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.075% saponin for 1 h. Following two 5-min washes with DPBS and 10% fetal bovine serum, the slides were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody at a 1:200 dilution in DPBS, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.075% saponin for 30 min. Following two 5-min washes with DPBS, the slides were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and glass coverslips (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). For experiments with green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins, the antibody incubations were omitted. Confocal images of IRS-1-GFP were obtained with a Nikon Optiphot 2 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Bio-Rad 1024 confocal laser scanning imaging system. This system uses a mixed argon/krypton laser (λ1 = 488 nm, blue line for fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC); λ2 = 586 nm, yellow line for rhodamine) and COSMOS/Lasersharp image analysis software (Bio-Rad). All other slides were viewed with a Zeiss Axiophot inverted microscope. Images were captured with a PentaMAX camera (Princeton Instruments Inc., Trenton, NJ) and IP Labs software (Scanalytics, Inc., Fairfax, VA) and processed with Adobe Photoshop. Quantitation of plasma membrane association was conducted by blind scoring of 150 cells from three independent experiments, with each sample performed in duplicate. We used the following scoring system. Cells with little plasma membrane staining received a score of zero. Cells in this category exhibit a diffuse cytoplasmic and/or nuclear pattern (resembling GFP alone) or are primarily cytoplasmic with a faint plasma membrane outline. Cells with significant plasma membrane association received a score of 1. Cells in this category have fluorescence either exclusively on plasma membrane ruffles or in distinct plasma membrane ruffles with some cytoplasmic staining, or in a bright outline at the cell periphery with minimal cytoplasmic staining. Translocation score was calculated as the percentage of cells scored as 1. This score is a semiquantitative index and is not necessarily linearly related to the number of molecules undergoing translocation. Statistical analysis of plasma membrane scoring was accomplished using SigmaPlot Version 5.0. COS-7 cells were transfected in 10-cm dishes using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.). The next day, cells were starved overnight (in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% insulin-free bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine); stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 5 min; and lysed in buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, and a Complete® protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer. Cell extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblotting was performed using the indicated primary antibody followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified using the NIH Image program. We constructed IRS-1-GFP fusion expression plasmids to monitor the effect of insulin upon the subcellular localization of IRS-1 in live cells (Fig.1). However, full-length IRS-1-GFP was localized to inclusion bodies seen as bright dots in the cytosol (Fig.2E). Additional experiments demonstrated that IRS-1-GFP was not efficiently phosphorylated in response to insulin (data not shown), consistent with the conclusion that IRS-1-GFP was localized in a non-physiological location. Therefore, we used either untagged or Myc-tagged protein in subsequent studies of full-length IRS-1.Figure 2Translocation of IRS-1 to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with either untagged IRS-1 (A and B) or IRS-1-Myc (C and D) expression plasmid. Cells were transfected with the IR and incubated in the presence of 100 nm insulin for 5 min (B and D) or transfected with empty vector and incubated in the absence of insulin (A and C). Immunostaining was carried out using either an anti-IRS-1 or anti-Myc primary antibody followed by an FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Arrows indicate plasma membrane ruffles. Indirect fluorescence of representative cells (n = 150) is shown. Bar = 20 µm. E shows that IRS-1-GFP was localized to inclusion bodies (visualized as bright dots in the cytosol).

Direct fluorescence of a representative cell is shown.Bar = 10 µm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, we investigated the effect of insulin on the subcellular localization of recombinant IRS-1. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with either IRS-1 or IRS-1-Myc expression vectors. Both recombinant IRS-1 and IRS-1-Myc were primarily cytoplasmic when expressed in cells incubated in the absence of insulin (Fig. 2, A and C). In contrast, transfection of cells with expression vectors for IRs and incubation in the presence of insulin promoted translocation of IRS-1 to distinct plasma membrane ruffles (Fig. 2, B and D). In preliminary studies, we did not detect an effect of insulin upon the localization of IRS-1 when cells were not cotransfected with IR expression vectors (data not shown). We were interested in defining a region that was capable of targeting IRS-1 to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. Therefore, we analyzed fragments of IRS-1 for their ability to target GFP to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). In contrast to recombinant full-length IRS-1, the IRS-1 N terminus (IRS-1-(1–262)) fused to GFP was associated with the plasma membrane in both the absence and presence of insulin (Fig. 3, Aand B). Identical results were obtained using IRS-1-(1–262) with a C-terminal Myc tag (data not shown). These findings suggest that the N terminus of IRS-1 is sufficient for plasma membrane association. Furthermore, taken together with data on full-length IRS-1, these observations suggest that the C terminus of IRS-1 may inhibit the ability of the IRS-1 N terminus to be targeted to the plasma membrane. The IRS-1 N terminus consists of at least two potential targeting regions, the PH and PTB domains. Thus, we explored the ability of these individual domains to target GFP to the plasma membrane. When the PH domain was fused to GFP, the resulting protein was recruited to plasma membrane ruffles in both unstimulated (Fig.4A) and insulin-stimulated (data not shown) cells. We confirmed that the recombinant Myc-tagged PH domain was also targeted to the plasma membrane, suggesting that the GFP moiety was not distorting the subcellular localization (Fig.4B). In contrast to the PH domain, the isolated PTB domain tagged with either GFP or Myc did not target to the plasma membrane in either the absence (Fig. 4, C and D) or presence (data not shown) of insulin. To assess the contribution of the PH and PTB domains to the plasma membrane targeting ability of IRS-1, we individually mutated sites in these domains that are predicted to reduce their affinity for phosphoinositides. Like the PH domains from other molecules such as Bruton's tyrosine kinase, Gab1, and protein kinase B, the PH domain of IRS-1 contains a conserved arginine residue at position 28 in the β2-strand. Mutation of this arginine to cysteine has been demonstrated to significantly reduce the affinity of PH domain-containing molecules for phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (4Razzini G. Ingrosso A. Brancaccio A. Sciacchitano S. Esposito D.L. Falasca M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 823-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, the IRS-1 PTB domain was found to bind to phosphoinositides and inositol polyphosphates, specifically inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate and inositol P6, via three critical lysine residues in the PTB domain (positions 169, 171, and 177) (7Takeuchi H. Matsuda M. Yamamoto T. Kanematsu T. Kikkawa U. Yagisawa H. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Replacement of each individual lysine residue with glutamine also was shown to result in a 50% reduction in phosphoinositide binding (7Takeuchi H. Matsuda M. Yamamoto T. Kanematsu T. Kikkawa U. Yagisawa H. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate the membrane targeting ability of the PH and PTB domains, we mutated arginine 28 to cysteine (R28C) in the PH domain and/or lysines 169, 171, and 177 to glutamine (3KQ) in the PTB domain, which are believed to be critical for phosphoinositide and inositol phosphate binding. We then assessed the ability of these specific point mutations to affect the plasma membrane targeting ability of both full-length IRS-1-Myc and an IRS-1-(1–262)-GFP fusion protein containing the PH and PTB domains. The Myc-tagged IRS-1 protein containing mutations in the PH and PTB domains was used because the full-length IRS-1-GFP fusion protein predominantly accumulated in inclusion bodies. Following incubation in serum-free medium and/or insulin stimulation, cells with low levels of plasma membrane staining were scored as zero, whereas those with significant levels of plasma membrane staining were scored as 1 (Fig.5) (see “Experimental Procedures”). As we demonstrated earlier, full-length IRS-1-Myc was primarily cytoplasmic in the unstimulated state, and it translocated to plasma membrane ruffles following insulin stimulation (Fig.6, upper panel, Aand B). Quantitation of our observations revealed that wild-type IRS-1-Myc visibly translocated to the plasma membrane in response to insulin in ∼40% of the cells (Fig. 6, lower panel). Mutation of either the PH or PTB domain reduced the ability of IRS-1 to associate with the plasma membrane in the insulin-stimulated state (Fig. 6, upper panel,C–F). The R28C mutation reduced the translocation score by ∼75%, whereas the 3KQ triple mutation led to a 50% reduction. When both the PH and PTB domains where mutated, translocation was inhibited to the same extent as with the R28C mutation alone. To study the effects of our mutations on the isolated IRS-1 N terminus (IRS-1-(1–262)-GFP), we employed the same method to score cells for significant plasma membrane association (see “Experimental Procedures”). Mutation of either the PH or PTB domain reduced the plasma membrane association of the IRS-1-(1–262)-GFP fusion protein (Fig. 7, upper panel). Consistent with what we observed using IRS-1-Myc, the R28C mutation reduced the plasma membrane targeting ability of the IRS-1-(1–262)-GFP fusion protein by 90% in the unstimulated state and by 67% in the stimulated state (Fig. 7, lower panel). Additionally, when both the PH and PTB domains were mutated, the reduction in plasma membrane association was not detectably different from the effect of the R28C mutation alone. Interestingly, the 3KQ mutation significantly reduced the translocation score of the IRS-1-(1–262)-GFP fusion protein by 67% in the unstimulated state, but this reduction was less severe in the insulin-stimulated state (30%) and did not reach statistical significance. Next, we confirmed the ability of the R28C mutation to reduce the plasma membrane targeting ability of the isolated PH domain-GFP fusion. The wild-type IRS-1 PH domain-GFP and IRS-1 R28C-GFP fusion proteins were expressed separately in COS-7 cells. After insulin stimulation, cells were scored for significant plasma membrane association. In contrast to the findings of Razzini et al. (4Razzini G. Ingrosso A. Brancaccio A. Sciacchitano S. Esposito D.L. Falasca M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 823-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), our wild-type IRS-1 PH domain-GFP fusion protein was targeted to the plasma membrane in both the unstimulated and insulin-stimulated states (Fig.8, upper panel). Although the percentage of cells displaying distinct plasma membrane localization increased from 45 to 65% (Fig. 8, lower panel) following insulin stimulation, this difference was not statistically significant (as determined by Student's t test). Additionally, the R28C mutation reduced the plasma membrane association of IRS-1 PH domain-GFP by 67% in both the unstimulated and insulin-stimulated states. It has been suggested that plasma membrane targeting is a prerequisite for insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS molecules. The R28C and 3KQ mutations reduce the ability of IRS-1 to translocate to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. Therefore, we investigated the ability of these IRS-1 mutants to become tyrosine-phosphorylated. Since recombinant IRS-1 was not efficiently phosphorylated by the endogenous IR (data not shown), it was necessary to cotransfect COS-7 cells with recombinant IR. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the Myc-tagged IRS-1 mutants and the IR. Following insulin stimulation, cell extracts were used for immunoblotting. Probing with an anti-Myc antibody showed that both the wild-type and mutant IRS-1 proteins were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 9B). Interestingly, both the wild-type and mutant IRS-1 proteins were found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated to a similar extent (Fig. 9A,lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). Thus, we were concerned that the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was recognizing endogenous IRS-1 molecules in addition to the recombinant IRS-1 molecules. However, when COS-7 cells were transfected with the IR alone, insulin-stimulated endogenous IRS-1 was not detectable by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (data not shown). We also considered the possibility that overexpression of the IR might lead to maximal IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, thereby masking the differences between the wild-type and mutant IRS-1 molecules. To address this issue, we conducted control experiments in which IRS-1 plasmid DNA levels were held constant while IR plasmid levels were varied (data not shown). We found that when IR expression levels were sufficient, further increases did not lead to additional insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. As judged by densitometric quantitation of three separate experiments (Fig. 9C), the ratio of phosphotyrosine to total recombinant IRS-1 in the mutants appeared slightly decreased compared with wild-type IRS-1. However, this difference was not statistically significant. Thus, the defect in targeting to the plasma membrane did not appear to cause a significant impairment of the ability of the mutant IRS-1 molecules to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin. IRS-1 was initially believed to be membrane-associated, but more recent studies suggest that the majority is associated with the cytoskeleton. In early subcellular fractionation experiments, it was reported that IRS-1 co-fractionated with either the low density microsomal fraction (16Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24442-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or intracellular membranes (17Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11548-11555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, by more extensive fractionation, Clark et al. (3Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 121-125Google Scholar) separated IRS-1 from membranes, but not cytoskeletal elements. Additionally, IRS-1 was resistant to extraction with ionic detergent, suggesting that the majority of IRS-1 was associated with the cytoskeleton (18Clark S.F. Molero J.C. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3819-3826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Even though all IRS molecules contain a PH domain, presumably to target them to the plasma membrane, only IRS-3 is found predominantly in the plasma membrane fraction (19Anai M. Ono H. Funaki M. Fukushima Y. Inukai K. Ogihara T. Sakoda H. Onishi Y. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29686-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, IRS-1 and IRS-2 primarily co-fractionate with the low density microsomes (19Anai M. Ono H. Funaki M. Fukushima Y. Inukai K. Ogihara T. Sakoda H. Onishi Y. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29686-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although the majority of IRS-1 is associated with intracellular membranes or the cytoskeleton, it remains possible that translocation of a percentage of IRS-1 molecules to the plasma membrane might be required to mediate insulin signaling. It has been hypothesized that IRS-1 translocates to the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation via its PH domain. Indeed, the translocation of individual IRS PH domains has been reported in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (4Razzini G. Ingrosso A. Brancaccio A. Sciacchitano S. Esposito D.L. Falasca M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 823-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, other groups have reported translocation from intracellular membranes to t"

The complete Py early region encoding the large T-antigen (PyLT), middle T-antigen (PyMT) and small T-antigen (PyST) will transform primary rodent cells and REF52 cells, but PyMT, the main Py oncogene, by itself will only transform these cells when p53 or ARF is inactivated. We have related Py oncogene cooperation with the effects of the Py T-antigens on the ARF-p53 signaling pathway. PyMT activates an ARF-induced p53-mediated block to cell division explaining the inability of PyMT alone to generate dividing transformed cells. In contrast, in REF52 cells transformed by the whole Py early region (PyREF52), ARF is upregulated but p53 is not activated. Thus PyLT and/or PyST negates the PyMT-induced ARF-mediated block to cell division by disrupting the signaling pathway from ARF to p53. Although there is no detectable interaction or co-localization of endogenous ARF (nucleoli) and MDM2 (nucleoplasm) in PyREF52 cells, expression of transfected ectopic ARF results in an MDM2/ARF interaction and sequestration of MDM2 into the nucleoli. Sequestration of MDM2 by ARF in the nucleoli is not essential for a p53 response in REF52 cells as activation of Raf in REF52Raf-ER cells results in an ARF-induced p53-mediated cell cycle block in the absence of a detectable ARF-MDM2 interaction. Py may provide new insights into the cellular ARF-p53 signaling pathway."

To understand the function of Fyn tyrosine kinase, we attempted to identify Fyn Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-binding proteins from a Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction of the mouse brain. β-Adducin, an actin filament-associated cytoskeletal protein, was isolated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by tandem mass spectrometry. β-Adducin was tyrosine phosphorylated by coexpression with wild type but not with a kinase-negative form of Fyn in COS-7 cells. Cell staining analysis showed that coexpression of β-adducin with Fyn induced translocation of β-adducin from the cytoplasm to the periphery of the cells where it was colocalized with actin filaments and Fyn. These findings suggest that tyrosine-phosphorylated β-adducin associates with the SH2 domain of Fyn and colocalizes under plasma membranes.

In contrast to their diverse functions, mice lacking Src, Lyn, or Yes did not show any prominent neurological phenotype, probably because they can compensate each other (1Lowell C.A. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1845-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, loss of the Fyn gene resulted in several behavioral abnormalities accompanied by changes in the construction of the neuronal network (2Grant S.G. O'Dell T.J. Karl K.A. Stein P.L. Soriano P.

We have recently found that Fyn-deficient mice have longer free running periods in the circadian rhythm of locomotive activity and a disorder of neuronal distribution in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, a master circadian oscillator (8Shima T. Yagi T. Isojima Y. Okumura N. Okada M. Nagai K. Brain Res. 2000; 870: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Fyn might have specific and essential functions in the brain. One possible function of these kinases is to regulate cytoskeletal organization and cell-to-cell contact. Rearrangement of the actin cytoskeletal structure was observed in cells transformed by v-Src (9Parsons J.T. Weaber M.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 147: 79-127PubMed Google Scholar) and those deficient in C-terminal Src family kinase (CSK),1 the negative regulator of Src family kinases (10Nada S. Okada M. Aizawa S. Nakagawa H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3571-3578PubMed Google Scholar, 11Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Cells bearing activated forms of Src family kinases exhibit lower stress fiber formation and weaker cell contacts. This may be partly the result of direct phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins at their tyrosine residues by these kinases. Src family kinases form complexes with several cytoskeletal components and signaling molecules at the site of cell contacts through their Src homology 2 (SH2) and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. When integrins attach to the extracellular matrix, focal adhesion kinase is activated and undergoes autophosphorylation of its Tyr-397 (12Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar), which composes an SH2 domain binding site for Src family tyrosine kinases, leading to phosphorylation at Tyr-925 by Src family kinases (13Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D.

Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that certain signal transduction molecules are assembled on spatially coordinated membrane microdomains, called the raft, to enhance the efficiency in propagation of extracellular signals into the cells. The raft is highly hydrophobic island-like spots of plasma membranes and is hard to be solubilized with non-ionic detergents (17Rietveld A. Simons K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Src family kinases are myristoylated or palmitoylated at their N termini to associate with hydrophobic membrane substructures. Among them, Fyn can bind to two lipid molecules at its N terminus (18Alland L. Peseckis S.M. Atherton R.E. Berthiaume L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16701-16705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and so is most highly concentrated in the raft fraction. In the raft, activities of Src family kinases are regulated in several different ways (19Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nada S. Nagai K. Tarakohpvsky A. Okada M. Nature. 2000; 404: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). A constitutively active form of c-Src expressed in fibroblasts was detected mostly in the detergent-insoluble fraction (20Kaplan K.B. Bibbins K.B. Swedlow J.R. Arnaud M. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4745-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We have found that c-Src was activated in high density cultures of PC12 cells and translocated from the Nonidet P-40-soluble to -insoluble fractions (21Kobayashi S. Okumura N. Nakamoto T. Okada M. Hirai H. Nagai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16262-16267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the translocation from detergent-soluble to -insoluble fractions accompanied the activation of Src family kinases. To investigate the function of Fyn in the brain, we attempted to isolate Fyn SH2 domain-binding proteins from the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction of mouse brain. In the present paper, we show identification and characterization of a cytoskeletal protein, β-adducin, as a Fyn-binding protein. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (clone 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology), anti-Fyn monoclonal antibody (clone Fyn301, Wako Chemicals), anti-Fyn polyclonal antibody (FYN3, Santa Cruz), and anti-HA monoclonal antibody (clone 12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were purchased. Anti-β-adducin antiserum was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with GST-β-adducin (amino acids 522–726) fusion protein. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG (ICN) were used as secondary antibodies. Rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used to visualize actin filaments. Other materials and chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. To prepare GST-Fyn SH2 fusion protein, cDNA encoding the SH2 domain of Fyn was subcloned into pGEX vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fusion protein was then produced in Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) affinity chromatography. To obtain a plasmid expressing HA epitope-tagged β-adducin, cDNA encoding mouse β-adducin was inserted into the KpnI-EcoRI site of pHM6 vector. pME-SM plasmids expressing wild type and a kinase-negative form of Fyn (Lys-299 → Met-299) were provided by Dr. T. Yamamoto (22Takeuchi M. Kuramochi S. Fusaki N. Nada S. Kawamura-Tsuzuku J. Matsuda S. Sembe K. Toyoshima K. Okada M. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27413-27419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygous Fyn-deficient (−/−) mice were produced by inserting lacZ into the SH2, SH3, and tyrosine kinase domains of Fyn in the cells of an embryonic stem cell line (TT2) (3Yagi T. Aizawa S. Tokunaga T. Shigetani Y. Takeda N. Ikawa Y. Nature. 1993; 366: 742-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Homozygous Fyn-deficient (−/−) mice were obtained by crossing heterozygous (+/−) mice. The genotype was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (4Miyakawa T. Yagi T. Watanabe S. Niki H. Brain Res. 1994; 27: 179-182Google Scholar). In the experiments that compared wild type (+/+) with homozygous (−/−) mutant mice, age-matched male littermates were used. For protein purification, wild type (+/+) parent mice were used. All animals were kept under standard laboratory conditions with a 12 h-12 h light-dark cycle. Brains of mice were removed quickly after decapitation and homogenized in TNE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/liter aprotinin, 10 mg/liter leupeptin, and 5 mmmercaptoethanol) at a ratio of 10:1 (v/w). After standing for 30 min, the homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 48,000 ×g, and the pellet was collected. The pellet was washed once with TNE buffer and solubilized in a quarter-volume of RIPA buffer (TNE buffer supplemented with 0.1% SDS and 0.5% deoxycholate). After centrifugation for 30 min at 48,000 × g, the supernatant (RIPA lysate) was transferred to fresh tubes, and the protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford with bovine serum albumin as a standard. COS-7 cells were plated on six-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine at a density of 3.0 × 104cells/cm2, cultured for 24 h, and transfected with 5 μg of DNA using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 24 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with RIPA buffer for 20 min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to obtain a clear supernatant. For the pull-down assay, lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose bound to GST-Fyn SH2 or GST for 3 h at 4 °C with rotation. After washing seven times with TNE buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, proteins were eluted with 1 mm glutathione. For the immunoprecipitation assay, cell lysates were incubated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h, centrifuged to remove nonspecific materials, and the supernatant was incubated with the respective antibodies for 2 h followed by protein G-Sepharose for 1 h. The immunoprecipitate was washed with TNE buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. Proteins were separated by isoelectric focusing with immobilized pH gradients for the first dimension. Dried immobilized pH gradient gels (Immobiline pH 3-10NL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were rehydrated with rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Pharmalyte) containing sample proteins for 12–16 h at room temperature and then focused at 10.5 kilovolt hours for 7-cm gels or 19 kilovolt hours for 13-cm gels. For the second dimension, the gels were equilibrated with equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 7 m urea, 2 mthiourea, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS) and applied onto 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were excised from Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels and digested with Achromobacter protease I. The resultant peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column and subjected to electrospray ionization-MS/MS (Q-TOF, Micromass, Manchester, U. K.) for peptide sequencing, as described previously (23Ichihara Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 448-492Google Scholar). The MS/MS spectra were interpreted by SeqMS, a software aid for de novo sequencing by MS/MS (24Fernandez-de-Cossio J. Gonzalez J. Satomi Y. Shima T. Okumura N. Besada V. Betancourat L. Padron G. Shimonishi Y. Takao T. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1694-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the sequence tags obtained, together with the molecular masses, were subjected to MS-Tag (25Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar) for data base searching. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (T-TBS), incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h, washed with T-TBS, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h, and washed with T-TBS. Immunoreactivity was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). COS-7 cells were plated on glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine at a density of 1.0 × 104 cells/cm2, cultured for 24 h, transfected with respective plasmids by the calcium phosphate method, and then cultured for 24 h. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min, and blocked with blocking buffer (T-TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin). Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in the blocking buffer followed by secondary antibodies. For visualizing the actin filaments, cells were incubated with rhodamine phalloidin together with secondary antibodies. Fluorescence images were examined using a confocal laser scaning microscope (Carl Zeiss). To isolate proteins that interact with the Fyn SH2 domain, Nonidet P-40-insoluble materials from mouse brains were solubilized with RIPA buffer and incubated with GST or GST-Fyn SH2 fusion protein coupled with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Several phosphotyrosil proteins were precipitated with GST-Fyn SH2, but not with GST, indicating that these proteins interacted selectively with the Fyn SH2 domain (Fig. 1 A). Among them, a 116 kDa band exhibited lower tyrosine phosphorylation in homozygous Fyn-deficient mice (−/−) than in wild type mice (+/+), indicating that the protein could have a functional relationship with Fyn tyrosine kinase. Because the 116 kDa band might contain more than one protein, the precipitated proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1 B, three spots corresponding to the 116 kDa band were detected and termed PI3, PI5, and PI7. Compared with a silver staining pattern of RIPA lysate, PI5 and PI7 spots overlapped with horizontal arrays of protein signals (Fig. 1 C), whereas pI3 did not have corresponding protein signals at detectable levels. The spot of PI7 almost overlapped that of anti-focal adhesion kinase as detected by Western blotting (data not shown), so we next tried to identify PI5 protein using MS. The protein spot (PI5) was excised from a Coomassie-stained gel and digested with Achromobacter protease I. Four peptides, isolated by HPLC, were analyzed by electrospray ionization-MS/MS. The resultant spectra, through analysis by SeqMS, gave the sequence tags for each peptide. The data base search using MS-Tag, based on the sequence tags and the molecular masses, revealed the protein as mouse β-adducin with high relatively. In addition, the apparent molecular mass of β-adducin on SDS-PAGE was consistent with that reported previously (26Kaiser H.W. O'Keefe E. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), despite the discrepancy between the apparent (116 kDa) and calculated molecular mass of β-adducin (80 kDa). These results strongly suggested PI5 for β-adducin. To confirm that PI5 was β-adducin, we prepared a polyclonal antibody against the GST-β-adducin (amino acids 522–726) fusion protein. It detected a single band of 116 kDa in lysates from COS-7 cells expressing exogenous β-adducin, suggesting that it reacted with β-adducin specifically (data not shown). Immunoblotting of a two-dimensional gel with this antibody showed that it reacted a single spot of 116 kDa with pI 5–6 (Fig. 2 A). When this image was superimposed on a blot with phosphotyrosine, the position of the anti-β-adducin-immunoreactive spot coincided with PI5 (Fig. 2,B and C). The phosphotyrosine spot, PI5, appears to be more elongated to the acidic and high molecular weight area than the β-adducin spot, but it was probably because a small portion of β-adducin was highly tyrosine-phosphorylated and showed an acidic shift in isoelectric focusing and lower mobility in SDS-PAGE. To confirm the interaction of the Fyn SH2 domain with β-adducin further, the GST-Fyn SH2 fusion protein was incubated with brain lysate, and bound proteins were immunoblotted with anti-β-adducin antibody (Fig. 3). Brain homogenate was first solubilized in TNE buffer, then the insoluble materials were solubilized in RIPA buffer. β-Adducin was found in the RIPA-soluble fraction much more than in the TNE-soluble fraction. An association of Fyn SH2 and β-adducin was observed in the RIPA-soluble fraction but not in the TNE-soluble fraction. When precipitates from RIPA lysate with the GST-Fyn SH2 domain were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, β-adducin associated with Fyn SH2 domain was detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 3 B). The SH2 domain is a protein motif found in a variety of signaling molecules including other members of Src family kinases. To examine the specificity of β-adducin to the Fyn SH2 domain, brain lysates were precipitated with GST fused with SH2 domains of Src, Lyn, CSK, and SHP2 (Fig. 3 C). Among them, the c-Src SH2 domain had highest homology, 66% , with the Fyn SH2 domain. However, β-adducin was not precipitated with any of these fusion proteins except for the GST-Fyn SH2 domain. To examine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of β-adducin was dependent on the tyrosine kinase activity of Fyn, HA epitope-tagged β-adducin was cotransfected with Fyn into COS-7 cells, and its tyrosine phosphorylation level was analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Cells transfected with wild type Fyn, but not with the kinase-negative form of Fyn, showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation in several cellular proteins (Fig. 4 A). Tyrosine phosphorylation of recombinant β-adducin was observed in cells cotransfected with wild type Fyn (Fig. 4 B). On the other hand, its tyrosine phosphorylation was not observed in cells transfected with β-adducin alone or those cotransfected with β-adducin and the kinase-negative form of Fyn. These observations indicate that Fyn tyrosine kinase is able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of β-adducin. To assess the interaction of these two proteins in vivo, Fyn was immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells with anti-Fyn antibody, and the immune complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-β-adducin antibody. When COS-7 cells were cotransfected with β-adducin and wild type Fyn, β-adducin was coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Fyn antibody (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that full-length Fyn protein could interact with β-adducin. On the other hand, interaction was not observed in cells expressing β-adducin alone or β-adducin together with the kinase-negative form of Fyn. Similar results were obtained when cell lysates were incubated with GST-Fyn SH2 fusion protein and precipitated proteins were analyzed (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that tyrosine kinase activity of Fyn is required for binding of β-adducin to the Fyn SH2 domain. To examine the physiological significance of the interaction of these proteins, we analyzed the localization of β-adducin expressed in COS-7 cells by immunocytochemical staining. When HA-tagged β-adducin alone was expressed, it was diffusely present in the cytoplasm of the cells as detected by anti-HA antibody (Fig. 6 A) or anti-β-adducin antibody (data not shown). Because Src family kinases are membrane-associated proteins, Fyn immunoreactivity was highest at the plasma membrane in COS-7 cells transfected with wild type Fyn (Fig. 6 E). In cells cotransfected with β-adducin and wild type Fyn, β-adducin was translocated to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane and perinuclear area (Fig. 6 G). The merged image of β-adducin and Fyn immunofluorescence showed colocalization of these proteins (Fig. 6 I). In contrast, in cells cotransfected with β-adducin and the kinase-negative form of Fyn, β-adducin remained in the cytoplasmic region and did not overlap Fyn. These findings are consistent with our biochemical data described above (Figs. 4 and 5). It has been shown that β-adducin bound to the actin filaments to form spectrin-actin meshwork beneath the plasma membrane. We visualized the actin filaments of COS-7 cells expressing β-adducin with rhodamine phalloidin. When β-adducin was expressed alone, it was distributed in the cytoplasm of the cells and only partially overlapped the actin filaments (Fig. 7, A–C). However, when β-adducin was cotransfected with wild type Fyn, β-adducin was detected mostly at cortical areas of the cells and was colocalized with actin filaments (Fig. 7, D–F). Src family kinases have critical roles in the signal transduction of extracellular information into cells and regulation of cytoskeletal organization. These kinases are thought to form complexes with cytoskeletal proteins and a variety of signaling molecules at the plasma membrane. The association of Src family kinases with these complexes is mostly through their SH2, SH3, and N-terminal alkylated domains (27Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). We purified a Fyn SH2 domain-binding protein from Nonidet P-40-insoluble components of mouse brain and identified it as β-adducin (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). Adducin was originally purified from human erythrocyte membrane skeletons (28Gardner K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1339-1348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and from brain membranes (29Bennett V. Gardner K. Steiner J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5860-5869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as cytoskeletal proteins that regulate actin-spectrin junctions. There are three members of adducin, α-, β-, γ-adducin, which form a heteromeric protein complex comprised of either α/β subunits or α/γ subunits (29Bennett V. Gardner K. Steiner J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5860-5869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Dong L. Chapline C. Mousseau B. Flowler L. Ramsay K. Stevens J.L. Jaken S. J. Biol.

Life Sci. 2000; 57: 884-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). α- and γ-adducins are expressed in most tissues, whereas β-adducin is in more restricted tissues such as the brain and spleen (30Dong L. Chapline C. Mousseau B. Flowler L. Ramsay K. Stevens J.L. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25534-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 33Joshi R. Gilligan D.M. Otto E. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Because Fyn and β-adducin were abundant in the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction (Fig. 3, A and B), it is possible that these two proteins form a hydrophobic complex in neuronal cells. In addition, β-adducin was not associated with the SH2 domains of other proteins including Src, Lyn, CSK, and SHP2, indicating that association with β-adducin is a specific function of the Fyn SH2 domain (Fig. 3 C). Because the SH2 domain recognizes short peptide motifs bearing phosphotyrosine (34Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar), it is possible that the association of β-adducin with the Fyn-SH2 domain is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. β-Adducin has been reported to be phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues by protein kinase A (35Ling E. Gardner K. Bennet V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13875-13878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Matsuoka Y. Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol.

Bennet V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and Rho kinase (40Kimura K. Fukata Y. Matsuoka Y. Bennett V. Matsuura Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5542-5548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), but it was not known whether it is tyrosine-phosphorylated. In the present study, we showed for the first time that β-adducin is phosphorylated at its tyrosine residue (Fig. 4). The Milan hypertensive strain of rats develops a genetic form of renal hypertension (41Kiprov D. Cor. Vasa. 1980; 22: 116-128PubMed Google Scholar). This strain of rats has point mutations at tyrosine 316 to phenylalanine in α-adducin and arginine 529 to glutamine in β-adducin. A synthetic peptide around tyrosine 316 of α-adducin was phosphorylated by the Src family tyrosine kinase, Lyn,in vitro (42Bianchi G. Toripodi G. Casari G. Salardi S. Barber B.R. Garcia R. Leoni P. Torielli L. Cusi D. Ferrandi M. Pinna L.A. Baralle F.E. Ferrari P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3999-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In addition, it was found that HA epitope-tagged N-terminal β-adducin (amino acids 1–232) was tyrosine-phosphorylated in COS-7 cells expressing Fyn (data not shown). Thus, β-adducin may have multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. We found that ectopically expressed Fyn induced tyrosine phosphorylation of β-adducin in COS-7 cells, whereas a kinase-negative form of Fyn could not induce phosphorylation of β-adducin, indicating that kinase activity of Fyn was required for this phosphorylation (Fig. 4). In addition, the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of protein bands including β-adducin were reduced in Fyn-deficient mice (Fig. 1). Thus, it seems likely that β-adducin is one of the direct substrates of Fyn tyrosine kinase. In contrast to β-adducin, the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of most other proteins in Fyn (−/−) mice were not different from those in wild type mice probably because of compensation by other members of Src family kinases. This indicates that phosphorylation of β-adducin may be specific to Fyn tyrosine kinase. Further studies are needed to confirm these ideas. α-Adducin has been shown to be phosphorylated by Rho kinase at Thr-445 and Thr-480, resulting in binding to actin filaments and recruitment of spectrin (43Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Kinoshita N. Kawano Y. Matsuoka Y. Bennett V. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). On the other hand, protein kinase C phosphorylates α-adducin at Ser-726 and then inhibits the activity of adducin in recruiting spectrin to actin filaments. When Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, spectrin was translocated from the cell-cell contact sites to the cytoplasm in parallel with the increase in serine phosphorylation of α-adducin in the cytoplasm (39Matsuoka Y. Li X. Bennet V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of β-adducin resulted in translocation to actin filaments. This result suggests that in addition to serine and threonine residues, tyrosine residues are involved in determining the subcellular distribution of adducin in cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of β-adducin resulted in association with Fyn and translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and promoted colocalization of β-adducin with actin filaments at the plasma membrane. It has been reported that CSK was recruited to the plasma membrane by binding to the tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of a membrane-anchored scaffold protein, CSK-binding protein, through its SH2 domain (19Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nada S. Nagai K. Tarakohpvsky A. Okada M. Nature. 2000; 404: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In the plasma membrane, CSK could phosphorylate Src family kinases to suppress their kinase activities. Thus recruitment of signaling molecules mediated through SH2 domains seems to regulate distribution and function of a variety of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. In the brain, Fyn is concentrated in the postsynaptic density (2Grant S.G. O'Dell T.J. Karl K.A. Stein P.L. Soriano P. Kandel E.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), nerve growth cone membranes (44Bixby J.L. Jhabvala P. J.

Shigetani Y. Okado N. Tokunaga T. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3343-3351PubMed Google Scholar). Adducin is enriched at dendritic spines and growth cones of cultured neural cells (33Joshi R. Gilligan D.M. Otto E. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 39Matsuoka Y. Li X. Bennet V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These reports raised the possibility that Fyn and adducin interact with each other in certain regions of neurons and that they function cooperatively in neural events such as formation of neural network and synaptic transmission. β-Adducin was expressed in the aberrantly positioned neurons in Fyn null (−/−) mutant mice (data not shown). It raises the possibility that β-adducin might function to arrange the suprachiasmatic nucleus and hippocampal neurons in the accurate positions. It will be of interest to examine whether mice lacking β-adducin have any abnormalities found in Fyn (−/−) mutant mice such as construction of brain networks, learning, and circadian period generation (2Grant S.G.

Brn-3b functionally interacts with the estrogen receptor (ER) and in association with the ER, regulates transcription from estrogen responsive genes. In addition, Brn-3b expression is elevated in breast tumours compared to levels in normal mammary cells. To explore the role of Brn-3b in breast cancer, we established stable cell lines derived from the MCF7 human breast cancer cell line which had been transfected with Brn-3b sense or anti-sense constructs. The Brn-3b over-expressing cell lines exhibited increased growth rate, reached confluence at a higher saturation density, had higher proliferative activity, and an enhanced ability to form colonies in soft agar when compared to the control empty vector transfected cells. Likewise, the Brn-3b anti-sense cell lines showed reduced cellular growth and proliferation, reached confluence at a lower density, and exhibited a decreased ability to form colonies in soft agar when compared to the vector controls. Five to ten per cent of the Brn-3b over-expressing cells exhibited a severely altered morphology characterized by reduced adherence to tissue culture plastic, increased cell size, and a vacuolar cell shape. These results thus further indicate a role for the Brn-3b transcription factor in regulating mammary cell growth and suggest that its elevation in breast cancer is of functional significance."

Chem. 1967; 242: 82-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the reaction does not involve a net change in redox state, the enzyme has an absolute requirement for reduced FMN that is not consumed during substrate turnover. The role of reduced FMN has been subject to intense mechanistic studies (reviewed in Macheroux et al. (3Macheroux P. Schmid J. Amrhein N. Schaller A. Planta. 1999; 207: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)) that have led to a proposal of a mechanism involving radical chemistry (4Macheroux P. Bornemann S. Ghisla S. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25850-25858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Osborne A. Thorneley R.N.F. Abell C. Bornemann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35825-35830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Another issue revolving around the requirement for reduced flavin concerns the generation of the reduced cofactor and its sequestration by chorismate synthase. Chorismate synthases from eubacteria and plants have been shown to rely on an external source of reduced FMN, produced for example by a NAD(P)H-dependent FMN oxidoreductase. Because the reduced form of FMN binds much more tightly to the enzyme (6Macheroux P. Petersen J. Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it is thought that free reduced FMN is sequestered by chorismate synthase either from the cellular environment or is provided by a specific oxidoreductase. Chorismate synthases that depend on an external source of reduced FMN have been termed “monofunctional.” On the other hand, chorismate synthase from fungal sources, i.e. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Neurospora crassa, have been found to possess an additional intrinsic catalytic activity in that they can utilize NADPH to reduce the flavin cofactor (7Welch G.R. Cole K.W. Gaertner F.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 8Henstrand J.M. Schaller A. Braun M. Amrhein N. Schmid J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These enzymes have been termed bifunctional. So far bifunctionality appears to be restricted to chorismate synthases from fungal species, and the physiological implications of this exclusive occurrence in fungi are not known. Although the bifunctional chorismate synthase from N. crassa was among the first chorismate synthases studied (7Welch G.R. Cole K.W. Gaertner F.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the low abundance of the protein has prevented detailed studies of its biochemical properties. The higher molecular mass of the N. crassa enzyme (by 5–8 kDa) as compared with monofunctional bacterial and plant enzymes led to the hypothesis that N. crassa CS contains an additional NADPH binding site (9Henstrand J.M. Amrhein N. Schmid J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20447-20452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, attempts to identify this domain by construction of deletion mutants have not substantiated this hypothesis (9Henstrand J.M. Amrhein N. Schmid J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20447-20452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the mode and location of NADPH binding in the protein remain unknown. All chorismate synthases isolated so far have been shown to bind FMN only weakly (K d (Escherichia coli) = 30 μm, (6Macheroux P. Petersen J. Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)), and as a result, the FMN cofactor is entirely lost during purification. However, in presence of EPSP-oxidized FMN, binding is 1000-fold tighter in the case of theE. coli enzyme (6Macheroux P. Petersen J. Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, because binding of oxidized FMN to the N. crassa chorismate synthase can be assumed to be a prerequisite for its reduction by NADPH, it is conceivable that formation of a ternary complex of enzyme, FMN, and EPSP is required before reduction can occur. A similar substrate-enhanced reduction of the flavin cofactor by NADPH has been described with flavoprotein-dependent hydroxylases (10Husain M. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6657-6666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Powlowski J. Ballou D. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16008-16016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these enzymes, NADPH-dependent reduction of flavin is up to 5 orders of magnitude faster in the presence of the substrate. In contrast to reactions in which redox equivalents are consumed stoichiometrically during substrate turnover, the FMN cofactor of chorismate synthase remains in its active reduced form during EPSP consumption (7Welch G.R. Cole K.W. Gaertner F.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12White P.J. Millar G. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, molecular oxygen inactivates the enzyme as it reacts with reduced flavin to yield the oxidized flavin and hydrogen peroxide. Although exact rate constants for reoxidation of the enzyme-bound reduced FMN by molecular oxygen have not been determined, this process occurs rapidly in vitro (6Macheroux P. Petersen J. Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because the redox state of the flavin cofactor is crucial to chorismate synthase activity, it can be envisaged that the redox balance in the cell may play a critical role in regulating the generation of chorismate and perhaps the flow through the shikimate pathway as a whole. However, the parameters that may affect the rate of reoxidation of the chorismate synthase-bound reduced FMN have not been studied experimentally. The bifunctional chorismate synthase provides an opportunity to directly study the reduction of its flavin cofactor with the physiological reductant NADPH as well as to monitor the reoxidation of the flavin by molecular oxygen with the same enzyme. Therefore, we have inserted the cDNA of the previously cloned gene for N. crassa chorismate synthase (9Henstrand J.M. Amrhein N. Schmid J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20447-20452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) into a high copy expression plasmid that can direct the expression of large quantities of the enzyme, thus allowing an extensive biochemical characterization.

The plasmid pCH11–11B containing the E. coli trpE gene coding for anthranilate synthase component I was a generous gift from Dr. P. Pouwels (University of Rijswijk, The Netherlands). This plasmid is a derivative of the pCH plasmid family containing two copies oftrpE. Competent E. coli PC 1562 cells (ΔtrpA-E, tryptophan auxotroph) were transformed with pCH11–11B and subsequently cultured according to Hessing et al. (15Hessing H.G. van Rotterdam C. Pouwels P.H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 210: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) overnight at 37 °C. The cells were then harvested, and the wet cell paste was stored at −80 °C. Bacterial extracts were analyzed for their expression of anthranilate synthase using 10% SDS-PAGE. In a typical preparation, cell paste from two liters of culture medium (ca. 20 grams) was resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A (0.1 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mmdithiothreitol) and lysed by sonication. Cell debris and insoluble components were removed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was dialyzed against buffer B (0.01 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 16 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. After washing, the bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of buffer B and buffer C (0.6 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Fractions were analyzed for the presence of anthranilate synthase by means of SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed against buffer B. To remove chorismate synthase from the protein preparation, the dialyzed sample was loaded onto a cellulose phosphate column (2.5 × 16 cm) prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and subsequently equilibrated with buffer B. Washing the column under these conditions with buffer B resulted in chorismate synthase binding to the resin, and anthranilate synthase was found in the flow-through. The flow-through was concentrated to ∼3 mg of protein ml−1 and stored at −80 °C. The concentration of the anthranilate synthase preparation was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of ε280 = 20720m−1 cm−1, calculated according to Mach et al. (13Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) or with Bradford reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin for calibration. Basic molecular manipulations were performed using standard techniques (28Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The previously constructed pTrc99a-NcCS vector (9Henstrand J.M. Amrhein N. Schmid J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20447-20452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was used for the amplification of the aroC gene, which codes for chorismate synthase from N. crassa. Two new restriction sites for the endonucleases NdeI at the 5′-end and HindIII at the 3′-end of the coding sequence were introduced by polymerase chain reaction. The amplified NdeI/HindIII fragment was inserted into the pET21a vector (Novagen, Lucerne, Switzerland), yielding pET21a-NcCS. The construct was verified by DNA sequencing and found to be identical to the sequence published in the N. crassa genome sequencing project (MIPS N. crassa data base at www.mips.biochem.mpg.de/proj/neurospora). The recombinant plasmid was transformed either into competent E. coliBL21(DE3) or BL21CodonPlus(DE3)-RP cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for analysis of expression. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Twenty-five g of bacterial cell paste was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1.3 mm EDTA, and 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.1 mg/ml DNase. After 1 h of stirring, cells were further lysed by sonication. Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation (30,000 × g, 20 min). The resulting supernatant was then subjected to a 40–50% ammonium sulfate fractionation. The precipitate from 50% ammonium sulfate saturation, which contained NcCS, was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in buffer A, dialyzed against the same buffer overnight, and then subjected to anion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 16 cm). After washing with buffer A, proteins were eluted using a linear gradient from 50 to 200 mm KCl (in buffer A). The progress of protein purification was monitored by 10% SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing NcCS were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.6, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 1.3 mm EDTA, and 0.45 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then loaded onto a cellulose phosphate column (2.5 × 16 cm) extensively equilibrated with buffer B. After washing with buffer B, NcCS was eluted with a linear gradient from 10–500 mm potassium phosphate in buffer B. Fractions containing NcCS were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration and transferred into 50 mm MOPS pH 7.5. The concentration of NcCS was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient ε280 = 18860 m−1cm−1, calculated according to Mach et al. (13Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) or with the Bradford reagent (see above). Anthranilate synthase activity was determined using the procedure of Ito et al. (14Ito J. Cox E.C. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 97: 725-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that 0.03m ammonium sulfate was added to the reaction mixture as an amino group donor (15Hessing H.G. van Rotterdam C. Pouwels P.H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 210: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Chorismate synthase activity was measured using forward coupling to the reaction catalyzed by AS as described by Schaller et al.(16Schaller A. Windhofer V. Amrhein N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The reaction buffer contained 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 4 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glutamine, 0.03 m ammonium sulfate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm FMN, 80 μm EPSP, and 50 picokatal of recombinant anthranilate synthase component I from E. coli. FMN was reduced either by the addition of 5 mm dithionite or 1 mmNADPH. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE performed on 10% gels according to Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue-R250 or alternatively blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. For the immunodetection of NcCS, an antibody raised against Corydalis sempervirens chorismate synthase (described in 16) and affinity-purified against E. coli chorismate synthase was used. To change amino acid residue 98 from a methionine to lysine, the QuikChange site-directed mutagensis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) was used. The construct pET21a-NcCS served as the template. The following oligonucleotides containing the appropriate codon exchange (ATG → AAG) were used for the procedure (the changed codon is underlined): 5′-GACTACGGTAACAAGACTAAGGACATCTACCCCCGCCCT-3′ and 3′-AGGGCGGGGGTAGATGTCCTTAGTCTTGTTACCGTAGTC-5′. All manipulations were performed after the manufacturer's instructions. The mutation was verified with an ABI 373 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the fluorescent dideoxy chain termination method. E. coli crude extracts were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins separated by electrophoresis were then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The band of interest was excised and subjected to automated Edman degradation in an applied Biosystems 477A sequencer. Absorbance spectra were recorded using a Uvikon 933 double-beam spectrophotometer (Kontron Instrument AG, Zürich, Switzerland). All assays were carried out in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. Fluorescence emission spectra were monitored with a Kontron spectrofluorometer (model SFM-25). The excitation wavelength for tryptophan fluorescence was 280 nm and for flavin fluorescence, 365 nm. All spectra were recorded in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. Rapid reaction kinetics were performed using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted 10cm path length cell and a diode array detector (SI Spectroscopy Instruments GmbH, Gutach, Germany). When necessary, enzyme and substrate solutions were made anaerobic by exchanging the dissolved oxygen with argon by several cycles of evacuation and flushing. Analysis of the data was performed using the program Specfit/32 (Dr. R. A. Binstead, Spectrum Software Associates, Marlborough, MA). Heterologous expression of NcCS in conventional E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells resulted in low yields of protein because of the usage of rare codons in the N. crassa cDNA (data not shown). Protein expression (Fig. 1) was greatly improved by using BL21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RP cells, which provide the required tRNAs for rare arginine and proline codons. The expression of NcCS in BL21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RP cells amounts to ∼5% of the total protein in crude extracts (Fig. 1, panel A, lanelabeled Wt, +). Western blot analysis of the crude protein extract with an antibody raised against C. sempervirenschorismate synthase (16Schaller A. Windhofer V. Amrhein N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and affinity-purified against E. coli chorismate synthase resulted in two bands of ∼41 and 46 kDa apparent molecular mass, respectively (Fig. 1, panel B,Wt, +). N-terminal sequence analysis identified the 46-kDa band as the full-length NcCS, whereas the 41-kDa band corresponds to a truncated form of NcCS with the first 97 N-terminal amino acids missing. Presumably the ATG coding for methionine 98 serves as a fortuitous translation start, giving rise to ∼50% of the total NcCS protein expression. A sequence alignment of all known chorismate synthases (data not shown) indicated that the methionine in this position is not conserved, but the majority of chorismate synthases feature a lysine in the corresponding position. Therefore, the ATG codon was replaced with AAG, introducing a lysine instead of the methionine in position 98. This manipulation of the cDNA resulted in complete abolishment of the expression of the truncated NcCS as is evident from Fig. 1 (panel B, M98K+) and allowed the exclusive expression of the full-length enzyme. The purified M98K mutant protein has a specific activity of 0.8 units/mg, similar to the value of 0.7 units/mg reported by Welch et al. (7Welch G.R. Cole K.W. Gaertner F.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) for wild-type enzyme. Because the introduced mutation had no effect on the specific activity of the enzyme, the M98K mutant protein was used in all experiments throughout this study and is referred to as NcCS. Expression of the protein in this manner greatly facilitated its purification, and a homogeneous preparation was obtained in a three-step protocol comprising ammonium sulfate precipitation of NcCS from the crude protein extract followed by DEAE-anion exchange chromatography and phosphocellulose chromatography in an adaptation of the method used by White et al. (12White P.J. Millar G. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The progress of purification and the purity of NcCS is documented in Fig.2. Typically, 70–80 mg of recombinant NcCS was obtained from 25 g of wet cell paste.Figure 2Purification of recombinant N. crassa chorismate synthase.

S, soluble supernatant of the bacterial crude extract (ca. 10 μg); AS, 50% ammonium sulfate precipitate (ca. 4 μg);DEAE, pooled fractions after DEAE-Sephacel chromatography (ca. 4 μg); PC, pooled fractions after cellulose phosphate chromatography (ca. 2 μg); protein molecular mass standards are indicated in kDa on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Chorismate synthase was incubated with either EPSP, oxidized FMN, or both, and the equilibration concentration of the free ligands was determined by ultrafiltration through a 10-kDa cut-off membrane (Amicon). The data obtained are summarized in TableI. Importantly, the dissociation constant for EPSP in the absence of oxidized FMN was found to be 33 μm and decreased slightly to 17 μm in the presence of oxidized FMN under the same conditions (Table I). Using this same method, the dissociation constant of oxidized FMN alone (K d = 92 μm) decreased ca.10-fold in the presence of EPSP (Table I). The effect of EPSP on the binding of oxidized flavin with the N. crassa chorismate synthase is ca. 100-fold less pronounced than with theE. coli enzyme (6Macheroux P. Petersen J. Bornemann S.

Open table in a new tab Purified recombinant NcCS was completely devoid of bound FMN (data not shown), indicating weak binding of the cofactor (7Welch G.R. Cole K.W. Gaertner F.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A similar finding has been reported for the enzyme from E. coli (6Macheroux P. Petersen J. Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) andThermotoga maritima (18Fitzpatrick T.B. Killer P. Thomas R. Jelesarov I. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18052-18059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Yet binding of oxidized FMN to NcCS can be directly monitored by the difference UV-visible spectrophotometry, the results of which are shown in Fig.3, panel A. The observed spectral changes are characterized by a hypochromic effect on the flavin absorbance with a maximum at 378 nm and an isosbestic point at 340 nm. Titration of NcCS with oxidized FMN showed saturation at high FMN concentrations, and a hyperbolic fit to the data produced a dissociation constant of 39 μm (see Fig. 3,inset of panel A) for FMN binding. Similarly, stoichiometric amounts of NcCS (31 μm) and oxidized FMN (25 μm) were titrated with EPSP. As shown in Fig. 3,panel B, the difference spectra are very similar in the near UV range, between 300 and 400 nm, whereas marked differences are found between 400 and 500 nm in comparison with the titration in the absence of EPSP (Fig. 3, panel A). In this range, a hyperchromic effect at 485 nm is observed with an additional isosbestic point at 475 nm (Fig. 3, panel B). As for oxidized FMN, titration with EPSP showed saturation behavior with a hyperbolic fit to the data giving a dissociation constant of 9 μm (see Fig. 3,inset of panel B). To facilitate direct comparison to binding studies carried out with the monofunctional chorismate synthases from E. coli (6Macheroux P. Petersen J. Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and T. maritima (18Fitzpatrick T.B. Killer P. Thomas R. Jelesarov I. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18052-18059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), absolute spectral changes were recorded in a separate experiment shown in Fig. 4. From such a comparison, it is evident that the UV-visible spectral changes are similar for all enzymes studied thus far (6Macheroux P. Petersen J. Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18052-18059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), in particular in the near UV range. As noted previously, the observed hypsochromic shift of the near UV absorbance peak at 370 nm and the higher resolution of the peak at 450 nm are indicative of a more apolar flavin environment (6Macheroux P. Petersen J. Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Fitzpatrick T.B. Killer P. Thomas R. Jelesarov I. Amrhein N.

The spectral changes were utilized to determine dissociation constants of oxidized FMN and EPSP in the presence of oxidized FMN as shown in the insets of Figs. 3 and 4 and are summarized in Table I.Figure 4UV-visible spectral changes recorded during titration of NcCS and FMN with EPSP. Chorismate synthase (41 μm) and FMN (25 μm) in 50 mmMOPS, pH 7.5. were titrated with EPSP.

https://openalex.org/W2076971497,"Many kinds of misfolded secretory proteins are known to be degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Dislocation of misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytosol and subsequent degradation by the proteasome have been demonstrated. Using the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, we have been studying the secretion of a heterologous protein, Rhizopus niveusaspartic proteinase-I (RNAP-I). Previously, we found that the pro sequence of RNAP-I is important for the folding and secretion, and that Δpro, a mutated derivative of RNAP-I in which the entire region of the pro sequence is deleted, forms gross aggregates in the yeast ER. In this study, we show that the degradation of Δpro occurs independently of the proteasome. Its degradation was not inhibited either by a potent proteasome inhibitor or in a proteasome mutant. We also show that neither the export from the ER nor the vacuolar proteinase is required for the degradation of Δpro. These results raise the possibility that the Δpro aggregates are degraded in the ER lumen. We have isolated a yeast mutant in which the degradation of Δpro is delayed. We show that the mutated gene is IRA2, which encodes a GTPase-activating protein for Ras. Because Ira2 protein is a negative regulator of the Ras-cAMP pathway, this result suggests that hyperactivation of the Ras-cAMP pathway inhibits the degradation of Δpro. Consistently, down-regulation of the Ras-cAMP pathway in theira2 mutant suppressed the defect of the degradation of Δpro. Thus, the Ras-cAMP signal transduction pathway seems to control the proteasome-independent degradation of the ER misfolded protein aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W1967477066,"Class III ribonucleotide reductase is an anaerobic enzyme that uses a glycyl radical to catalyze the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides and formate as ultimate reductant. The reaction mechanism of class III ribonucleotide reductases requires two cysteines within the active site, Cys-79 and Cys-290 in bacteriophage T4 NrdD numbering. Cys-290 is believed to form a transient thiyl radical that initiates the reaction with substrate and Cys-79 to take part as a transient thiyl radical in later steps of the reductive reaction. The recently solved three-dimensional structure of class III ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) from bacteriophage T4 shows that two highly conserved asparagines, Asn-78 and Asn-311, are positioned close to the essential Cys-79. We have investigated the function of Asn-78 and Asn-311 by site-directed mutagenesis and measured enzyme activity and glycyl radical formation in five single (N78(A/C/D) and N311(A/C)) and one double (N78A/N311A) mutant proteins. Our results suggest that both asparagines are important for the catalytic mechanism of class III RNR and that one asparagine can partially compensate for the lack of the other functional group in the single Asn → Ala mutant proteins. A plausible role for these two asparagines could be in positioning formate in the active site to orient it toward the proposed thiyl radical of Cys-79. This would also control the highly reactive carbon dioxide radical anion form of formate within the active site before it is released as carbon dioxide. A detailed reaction scheme including the function of the two asparagines and two formate molecules is proposed for class III RNRs."

The conjugation of ubiquitin to these proteins requires internal ten-amino acid-long protein destruction signal sequences. To evaluate how these destruction signals modulate interactions that must occur between E3α and the 3C proteases, we have kinetically analyzed the formation of ubiquitin-3C protease conjugates in a reconstituted system of purified E1, HsUbc2b/E214Kb, and human E3α. Our measurements show that the encephalomyocarditis virus 3C protease is ubiquitinated in this system with K m = 42 ± 11 µm and V max = 0.051 ± 0.01 pmol/min whereas the parameters for the ubiquitination of the hepatitis A virus 3C protease are K m = 20 ± 5 µm and V max = 0.018 ± 0.003 pmol/min. Mutations in the destruction signal sequences resulted in changes in the rate at which E3α conjugates ubiquitin to the altered 3C protease proteins. The K m andV max values for these reactions change proportionally in the same direction. These results suggest differences in rates of conjugation of ubiquitin to 3C proteases are primarily ak cat effect. Replacing specific encephalomyocarditis virus 3C protease lysine residues with arginine residues was found to increase, rather than decrease, the rate of ubiquitin conjugation, and the K m andV max values for these reactions are both higher than for the wild type protein. The ability of E3α to catalyze the conjugation of ubiquitin to both 3C proteases was found to be inhibited by lysylalanine and phenylalanylalanine, demonstrating that the same sites on E3α that bind destabilizing N-terminal amino acids in type I and II substrates also interact with the 3C proteases.

A hierarchical family of pathways, each composed of at least three enzymes, accomplishes the attachment of ubiquitin to proteins destined to be degraded (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (6817) Google Scholar, 2Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2894) Google Scholar, 3Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Bioessays. 1999; 22: 442-451Crossref Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Common to all of these pathways is the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1,1 which recruits free ubiquitin through the ATP-dependent formation of a thiolester bond between a cysteine in the E1 and the C-terminal glycine of the ubiquitin molecule. This ubiquitin is then transferred to one of several members of the E2 family of proteins that are referred to as ubiquitin carrier proteins or ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Finally, the ubiquitin is transferred from the E2 to the target substrate protein through the action of an ubiquitin-protein ligase, or E3. Although each E2 protein appears to function with several specific ubiquitin-protein ligases, each E3 can specifically interact with only a limited number of substrate proteins. Regardless of the E3 involved in the ubiquitination process, following the conjugation of the first ubiquitin molecule to a primary amine on the substrate protein, the E3, or the E3 plus E2 proteins, can catalyze additional conjugating reactions that result in the synthesis of a chain of ubiquitin molecules attached to the substrate (4Finley D.

Important unanswered questions remain as to precisely how the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases recognize and interact with their substrate proteins. It appears that proteins degraded by the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome system contain structural features, often short primary sequence elements (2Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2894) Google Scholar, 5Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), that act as protein destruction signals, and presumably it is these structural features that serve as sites for interaction with specific E3 proteins. Very few precisely mapped protein destruction signal structures have been matched with their cognate ubiquitin-protein ligase, however (2Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2894) Google Scholar).

In recent years it has been discovered that E3α and Ubr1p can catalyze the ubiquitination of proteins lacking destabilizing N-terminal amino acids (type III substrates). The short-lived yeast proteins Gpap and Cup9p, neither of which contains a destabilizing N-terminal amino acid, have been reported to be substrates for Ubr1p (17Madura K. Varshavsky A.

Ribonuclease S, the subtilisn-derived fragment of ribonuclease A, has a stabilizing serine N terminus, but it is known to be a substrate for mammalian E3α-dependent ubiquitin-protein conjugate synthesis (20Baboshina O.V.

This indicates these E3 enzymes can recognize substrate proteins through associations with other types of structural elements. E3α has recently been found to catalyze the conjugation of ubiquitin to two additional proteins that, based upon their N-terminal amino acids, would not be predicted to be N-end rule substrates for degradation. The 3C proteases produced by the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and the hepatitis A virus (HAV), both members of the picornavirus family, have been shown to serve as substrates for E3α-dependent ubiquitination (21Gladding R.L.

The ten-amino acid sequence 34LLVRGRTLVV43, located in what is probably a strand-turn-strand structure, has been discovered to function as a protein destruction signal in the EMCV 3C protease (22Lawson T.G.

The HAV 3C protease contains the sequence32LGVKDDWLLV41 in a location homologous to that of the EMCV protein destruction signal sequence, and this sequence has been shown to be required for the ubiquitination and degradation of the HAV 3C protein (21Gladding R.L.

The identification of two substrate proteins recognized by E3α, both of which contain precisely mapped, internal sequences known to be required for E3α-dependent ubiquitin conjugation, provides excellent model systems for detailed studies of the interactions that take place between E3α and substrate proteins lacking a destabilizing N-terminal amino acid. The recent development of an affinity chromatography purification method, based upon the specific binding of mammalian E3α to HsUbc2b, 4The HsUbc2b is identical in sequence to its rabbit ortholog (27Wing S.S.

Crinelli R. Siepmann T.J. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39428-39437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have used a reconstituted system of purified E1, HsUbc2b, and affinity-purified human E3α to evaluate the kinetics of the conjugation of ubiquitin to the EMCV and HAV 3C proteases. We have determined the K m and V maxvalues for the E3α-dependent conjugation of ubiquitin to the wild type 3C proteases and to 3C protease proteins containing mutations in their defined, internally located protein destruction signal regions. The kinetics with which EMCV 3C proteases containing selected lysine to arginine substitutions are ubiquitinated were also evaluated. Our results indicate that differences in the ability of the 3C proteases to serve as substrates for E3α are most likely the result of differences in the k cat values with which the catalysis of ubiquitin conjugation occurs. We also obtained data demonstrating that the interaction of E3α with the 3C protease proteins involves the same site, or sites, with which it associates with both basic and hydrophobic destabilizing N-terminal amino acids. Our findings explicate the ability of E3α to target non-N-end rule substrates for degradation and reveal that the mechanism by which the ubiquitin-protein ligase E3α selects substrate proteins for ubiquitination is considerably more complicated than suggested by earlier studies. The construction of the expression plasmids pETE3B′CD′*, pETHAV3C, and pETP3C have already been described (21Gladding R.L. Haas A.L. Gronros D.L. Lawson T.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The inserts were ligated into pET3d. pETP3CN33R, which contains the sequences coding for a mutated poliovirus 3C protease, was constructed using pETP3C as a template. A DNA insert fragment containing the mutated poliovirus 3C protease coding sequence was synthesized using the mutagenic primer GGAGTCCACGACCGCGTGGCTATTTTACCAACC. The insert was ligated into pET3d at the NcoI and BamHI sites. Human erythrocyte fraction II was prepared using procedures described previously (25Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J.

Human ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 was purified from this material using a ubiquitin affinity column and fast protein liquid chromatography methods described previously (26Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J.

Some of this protein was employed in the preparation of an affinity column, which was then used to purify ubiquitin-protein ligase E3α from the fraction II preparation as reported recently (20Baboshina O.V.

The wild type EMCV 3C and mutated (3C(+A38), 3C(L34A), 3C(R39D), 3C(K10,14R), 3C(K74,77R), and 3C(K98,101R)) protease proteins were expressed in E. coli from pETE3B′CD′*, pETE3C+A38, pETE3CL34A, and pETE3CR39D and were purified from refolded inclusion body material using procedures reported previously (22Lawson T.G. Gronros D.L. Werner J.A. Wey A.C. DiGeorge A.M. Lockhart J.L. Wilson J.W. Wintrode P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28429-28435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type HAV 3C protease was expressed in E. coli from pETHAV3C and purified as described previously (21Gladding R.L. Haas A.L. Gronros D.L. Lawson T.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The mutated HAV 3C(+A37) and 3C(D37R) proteins were expressed from pETHAV3CA37+ and pETE3CD37R, but the presence of the mutations necessitated an altered purification scheme. Cleared lysates from induced cells were passed through a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in TDE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The bound 3C protease proteins were eluted with a gradient of 300 to 650 mm NaCl in TDE buffer. The column fractions containing the 3C protease proteins were fractionated further and concentrated by precipitation with 30 to 50% (NH4)2SO4. The precipitates were resuspended in 10 mmKH2PO4-K2HPO4, pH 6.9, and applied to a column of Bio-Gel HTP hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in the same buffer. Bound material was eluted with a step gradient of 100 to 300 mmKH2PO4-K2HPO4, pH 7.2. The eluted proteins were dialyzed against TDE buffer containing 10% glycerol. Stock solutions of the 3C protease preparations were prepared to be ≤ 2 mg/ml. We have observed that at least some of the 3C proteins form aggregates, detectable by size exclusion chromatography, during long term storage at greater concentrations than this. All of the purified 3C protease proteins, with the exception of the wild type EMCV 3C protease, have an N-terminal methionine instead of the naturally occurring glycine or serine residues found in the mature proteins. The non-mutated EMCV 3C protease expressed in E. coli from pETE3B'CD'* undergoes self-processing to produce a protein with a glycine residue at the N terminus (22Lawson T.G. Gronros D.L. Werner J.A.

For convenience, both non-mutated proteins are referred to here as wild type proteins. Bovine ubiquitin (Sigma) was purified further to apparent homogeneity (28Anchordoguy T.J. Hand S.C. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1299-1305PubMed Google Scholar) and radioiodinated by the Chloramine T procedure (14Baker R.T. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1090-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Some of this material was subjected to reductive methylation (29Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The initial rates of 125I-ubiquitin conjugation were measured using an adaptation of methods employed previously (20Baboshina O.V. Crinelli R. Siepmann T.J. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39428-39437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures typically contained, in a final volume of 25 µl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 international unit/ml creatine phosphokinase (Sigma), 1 international unit/ml high protein liquid chromatography-purified yeast inorganic pyrophosphate (Sigma), 50 nm purified E1, 500 nm purified HsUbc2b, 0.2 µg of affinity-purified E3α preparation, 0 to 20 µm exogenous protein substrates, and 4 µm125I-ubiquitin or 125I-methylated ubiquitin (about 12,000 cpm/pmol). The mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 37 ° and then boiled for 4 min in the presence of 25 µl of added sample buffer. This incubation time was selected to yield a linear initial rate of monoubiquitination. The samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The amounts of monoubiquitin-substrate protein conjugates formed were determined by cutting slices from the dried gels and subjecting them to γ-counting (30Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6845-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Control experiments confirmed that the initial rate was linear with [E3α]0 and independent of [E1]0 or [HsUbc2b]0 (20Baboshina O.V. Crinelli R. Siepmann T.J. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39428-39437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Reaction rate data sets were generated by measuring the initial rates of monoubiquitinated conjugates produced in several simultaneously incubated reaction mixtures containing varying concentrations of 3C protease substrate. Two to four data sets were generated for each substrate protein using the same preparations of E1, HsUbc2b, and E3α. The rate versus substrate concentration data sets were simultaneously fit for each substrate to the K mvalue using a non-linear least squares regression analysis program (Sigma Plot 5.0). The V max values for each substrate were calculated by averaging the values derived from the fits for each data set. A coupled in vitro transcription-translation rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega) was employed to prepare35S-labeled poliovirus 3C and 3C(N33R) proteins encoded within pETP3C and pETP3CN33R. The ability of these proteins to serve as substrates for ubiquitination was evaluated by incubating 7 µl of transcription-translation reaction mixtures in a final volume of 20 µl containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm methylated ubiquitin, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, and 60% by volume reticulocyte lysate containing an energy-generating system at 30 ° for 40 min (21Gladding R.L.

Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Under appropriate conditions, kinetic analysis provides a sensitive and accurate means of quantifying enzyme-substrate interactions and the catalytic competence of the resulting Michaelis complex. We employed a biochemically defined, reconstituted N-end rule ubiquitin ligation system, comprised of affinity-purified human E1 and E3α and recombinant human HsUbc2b, to quantitatively evaluate the targeting of the EMCV and HAV 3C proteases for ubiquitin attachment and to assess the effect disrupting their respective destruction signal sequences has on their selection as N-end rule pathway substrates. A comparison of the labeled products generated by the reconstituted system with either α-lactalbumin or wild type EMCV 3C protease as the substrate is shown in the autoradiogram in Fig.1A, lanes 1–3. In the absence of a substrate protein, the otherwise complete assay mixture containing E1, HsUbc2b, and E3α catalyzes the synthesis of hyperconjugates to trace protein contaminants in the enzyme preparations, seen at the top of lane 1 (see Fig.1 A and Ref. 20Baboshina O.V. Crinelli R. Siepmann T.J. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39428-39437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Monoubiquitin-HsUbc2b conjugates are also generated under these conditions, at the concentration of this enzyme employed to assure E3α-limiting conditions. In reaction mixtures in which α-lactalbumin was the substrate most of the products synthesized during the incubation period were high molecular mass polyubiquitin-α-lactalbumin conjugates, and the characteristic ladder of sequential ubiquitin adducts is apparent (Fig. 1 A,lane 2). The conjugation of ubiquitin to the EMCV 3C protease occurred at a markedly lower rate, and the majority of these products consisted of monoubiquitinated 3C protease (Fig.1 A, lane 3). The rate of monoubiquitin-3C protease synthesis was found to be linear for up to 15 min. An increasingly large fraction of the products consisted of polyubiquitinated 3C protease at longer times (data not shown). This suggests the attachment of the first ubiquitin molecule to the 3C protease occurs more slowly than subsequent polyubiquitinated conjugate synthesis. It should be noted that the synthesis of polyubiquitinated α-lactalbumin conjugates has been shown to also be linear with respect to time and E3α concentration in a reaction system very similar to the one used here (20Baboshina O.V. Crinelli R. Siepmann T.J. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39428-39437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because our goal in this study was to attempt to detect potentially subtle differences in the kinetics with which related substrate proteins are ubiquitinated by the same ubiquitin-protein ligase, we preferred to avoid artifacts that might result from the use of ubiquitin mutants or derivatives that do not support polyubiquitin chain synthesis. In addition, the rate of the first ubiquitin attachment is more likely than subsequent steps to reflect substrate recognition events mediated by E3α. To confirm that the formation of polyubiquitinated 3C protease was not a major event during the incubation time, reactions were carried out in which125I-methylated ubiquitin was used in place of125I-ubiquitin.
