https://openalex.org/W2086274688,"Cationic lipids are widely used for gene transfer in vitro and show promise as a vector for in vivo gene therapy applications. However, there is limited understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved. We investigated the individual steps in cationic lipid-mediated gene transfer to cultured cell lines. We used DMRIE/DOPE (a 1:1 mixture of N-[1-(2,3-dimyristyloxy)propyl]-N,N-dimethyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ammonium bromide (DMRIE) and dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE)) as a model lipid because of its efficacy and because it is being used for clinical trials in humans. The data show that cationic lipid-mediated gene transfer is an inefficient process. Part of the inefficiency may result from the fact that the population of lipid-DNA complexes was very heterogeneous, even under conditions that have been optimized to produce the best transfection. Inefficiency was not due to inability of the complex to enter the cells because most cells took up the DNA. However, in contrast to previous speculation, the results indicate that endocytosis was the major mechanism of entry. After endocytosis, the lipid-DNA aggregated into large perinuclear complexes, which often showed a highly ordered tubular structure. Although much of the DNA remained aggregated in a vesicular compartment, there was at least a small amount of DNA in the cytoplasm of most cells. That observation plus results from direct injection of DNA and lipid-DNA into the nucleus and cytoplasm indicate that movement of DNA from the cytoplasm to the nucleus may be one of the most important limitations to successful gene transfer. Finally, before transcription can occur, the data show that lipid and DNA must dissociate. These results provide new insights into the physical limitations to cationic lipid-mediated gene transfer and suggest that attention to specific steps in the cellular process may further improve the efficiency of transfection and increase its use in a number of applications.

Gene transfer could represent an important advance in the treatment of both genetic and acquired diseases. Thus, there has been increasing attention focused on the development of gene transfer vectors. Viral vectors, such as recombinant adenovirus vectors, have a number of advantages for gene transfer, including their efficiency and their wide range of cell targets(1Graham F.L. Prevec L. Ellis R.W. Vaccines: New Approaches to Immunological Problems. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston1992: 363-390Crossref Google Scholar, 2Berkner K.L. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 616-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). But they also have a number of disadvantages, including the fact that they can generate several types of immune response, they often contain viral genes which could be transcribed, and there is a possibility of recombination or complementation. As a result of such limitations, there has been substantial effort focused on nonviral vectors, particularly the use of cationic lipids(3Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M.

Cationic lipids are commercially available and are widely used in the research laboratory. For gene therapy applications, cationic lipids are currently under investigation as transfer vectors for treatments focused on melanoma (10Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. Yang Z.-Y. Fox B.A. Plautz G.E. Gao X.

Despite their availability, wide use, and potential application as vectors for gene therapy, there is limited understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in cationic lipid-mediated gene transfer. As a result, wide variations in formulations and protocols have been described. For example, published reports of gene transfer to airway epithelia have used lipid to DNA charge ratios of 0.03 to 3 (net positive charge from the cationic component of the lipid divided by the net negative charge of the DNA) with the same or related compounds(13Logan J. DuVall M. Bebok Z. Dong J.-Y. Myles C. Peng S. Felgner P.L. Frizzell R.A. Matalon S. Sorscher E.J. Pediat. Pulmonol. Suppl. 1993; 9: 245Google Scholar, 14Yoshimura K. Rosenfeld M.A. Nakamura H.

Evaluation of cationic lipids usually involves comparison of different lipids and different formulations using expression of a transgene as the end point. However, such an approach is an empiric one that may provide little understanding of intermediate steps involved in transfection. Without knowledge of the cellular mechanisms of gene transfer and the limiting barriers involved, it will be difficult to take a rational approach to develop improved methods of gene transfer and it is difficult to test specific hypotheses related to cellular and molecular mechanisms. The goal of this work was to evaluate some of the cellular mechanisms involved in cationic lipid-mediated gene transfer and to identify the steps that may impair transfer. As a starting point, we used DMRIE/DOPE 1The abbreviations used are: DMRIE/DOPEa 1:1 mixture of N-[1-(2,3-dimyristyloxy)propyl]-N,N-dimethyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl) ammonium bromide (DMRIE) and dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE)MEMminimal essential mediumDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumCMVcytomegalovirusRSVRous sarcoma virusNBD4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazoleX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranosidePBSphosphate-buffered salineFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingTEMtransmission electron microscopyMBSmodified Barth's solutionDOTMAN-1-[2,3-bis(oleoyloxy)]propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride. (a 1:1 mixture of N-[1(2,3-dimyristyloxy)propyl]-N,N-dimethyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl) ammonium bromide (DMRIE) and dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE)) as a model cationic lipid. In a systematic structure-activity analysis of a large number of lipids, Felgner and colleagues (4Felgner J.H. Kumar R. Sridhar C.N. Wheeler C.J. Tsai Y.J. Border R. Ramsey P. Martin M. Felgner P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2550-2561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) recently identified DMRIE/DOPE as a promising vector for gene transfer. In a comparison of several lipids, we also found DMRIE/DOPE to be effective and have optimized a series of factors and conditions required for efficient gene transfer to HeLa cells and to canine airway epithelium(12Fasbender A.J. Zabner J. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, protocols approved by the National Institutes of Health Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee propose to use DMRIE/DOPE as the vector for gene transfer to humans with cystic fibrosis(13Logan J. DuVall M. Bebok Z. Dong J.-Y. Myles C. Peng S. Felgner P.L. Frizzell R.A. Matalon S. Sorscher E.J. Pediat. Pulmonol. Suppl. 1993; 9: 245Google Scholar), melanoma (20Nabel G.J. Chang A.E. Nabel E.G.

The identification of these steps provides the opportunity to further improve the process, thereby increasing its utility and application. a 1:1 mixture of N-[1-(2,3-dimyristyloxy)propyl]-N,N-dimethyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl) ammonium bromide (DMRIE) and dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) minimal essential medium Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium cytomegalovirus Rous sarcoma virus 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside phosphate-buffered saline fluorescence-activated cell sorting transmission electron microscopy modified Barth's solution N-1-[2,3-bis(oleoyloxy)]propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride. HeLa cells were cultured in Eagle's MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mM nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. COS-1 cells were cultured in DMEM (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. C127 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and insulin (30 units/250 ml). To assess expression in mammalian cells, we used a plasmid containing the luciferase cDNA driven by the RSV promoter, pRSV-Luc, or a plasmid in which a CMV promoter drove expression of β-galactosidase with a nuclear localization signal, pCMV-βGal. To evaluate expression in Xenopus oocytes, we used a plasmid (pMT3-SEAP) that encodes a secreted form of alkaline phosphatase (23Swick A.G. Janicot M. Cheneval-Kastelic T. McLenithan J.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was purified on Qiagen columns (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). DMRIE/DOPE (50:50 molar ratio) was a gift from Dr. Phil Felgner, Vical Inc., San Diego, CA. Isatoic ester-labeled DMRIE was a gift from Dr. Eddy Lee, Genzyme, Inc., Cambridge, MA. The isatoic ester-labeled DMRIE/DOPE preparation was a 50:50 molar ratio of DMRIE (20 mol % isatoic ester-labeled DMRIE) with DOPE. The 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD)-labeled DOPE was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster. AL. The NBD-labeled DMRIE/DOPE preparation was a 50:50 molar ratio of DMRIE to DOPE (1 mol % NBD-DOPE). To evaluate expression in the cytoplasm without the requirement for plasmid DNA to enter the nucleus, we used the vaccinia virus/T7 hybrid expression system. This system uses infection with a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses the T7 RNA polymerase (vTF7-3) (25Moss B. Ahn B.Y. Amegadzie B. Gershon P.D. Keck J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1355-1358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and transfection with a plasmid in which the T7 promoter drives β-galactosidase expression (pTM-βGal). COS-1 cells were infected with vTF7-3 (m.o.i. of 5). After 1 h the incubation medium was removed, and the cells were transfected with increasing amounts of pTM-βGal (0.01-1 μg) complexes with DMRIE/DOPE at a 5:1 (w/w) ratio. The media was replaced 6 h after transfection, and the cells were incubated for an additional 10 h before analysis for β-galactosidase expression. As a control to test the efficiency of infection with vaccinia virus, a double infection with vTF7-3 plus vTF7-LacZ (ATCC) was performed. vTF7-LacZ encodes β-galactosidase under control of the T7 promoter. Ethidium monoazide was coupled to DNA as described previously(26Cantrell C.E. Yielding K.L. Pruitt K.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1979; 15: 322-330PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bolton P.H. Kearns D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 4891-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To 200 μg of pCMV-βGal in 2 ml of H2O was added 5 μg of ethidium monoazide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). This is a 50:1 molar ratio of nucleotide to probe. After a 10-min incubation period, the solution was exposed to UV light of principal wavelength 312 nm for 2 min. The solution was purified on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). To remove intercalated but not covalently bound ethidium, CsCl was added to a concentration of 1.1 g/ml and was gently mixed until it dissolved. Sodium citrate saturated isopropanol was then added and the upper phase, containing unbound ethidium, was discarded. The isopropanol washing was repeated until the upper phase appeared clear. The DNA in the bottom layer was then precipitated overnight at −20°C with 8 volumes of a 1:3 TE/absolute ethanol solution. To a solution of 100 μg of pCMV-βGal in H2O we added 1.63 μg of photoactivatable biotin (Pierce). This solution was exposed to ultraviolet light of principle wavelength 312 nm for 2 min. The biotinylated plasmid was purified on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. A solution of 29 μg of the biotinylated plasmid was incubated for 30 min with 1 ml of AuroProbe EM Streptavidin G1O (Amersham, Amersham, United Kingdom) in 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The preparation was purified on a PD-10 column and subsequently dialyzed for 24 h against 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, using a 100,000 molecular weight cut off membrane (Instrumed Inc., Union Bridge, MD). Spectroscopic measurements suggest that there was approximately 90 ng of Au-streptavidin/μg of plasmid. We used Texas Red conjugated to 10-kDa dextran (D-1863, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR.), human transferrin (T-2875), or wheat germ agglutinin (W831). 500 μl of these tracers were applied to cells in a 20 μg/μl (transferrin and wheat germ agglutinin) or a 10 μg/μl (dextran) solution in DMEM. HeLa, C127, and COS-1 cells were seeded at 2-3 × 105 cells/35-mm dish the day before transfection. Plasmid and lipid were each diluted in 250 μl of Eagle's MEM. Lipid was added to the plasmid, mixed by inversion, and allowed to incubate 15-30 min at room temperature before being further diluted to a final volume of 1.5 ml. Cells were washed once with Eagle's MEM, and the lipid-DNA complex was added in a volume of 1.5 ml to each 35-mm dish. The transfection complex remained on the cells for 6 h, unless otherwise noted, and was then replaced with the appropriate media for the cell type. In some experiments, the lipid-DNA complex was left on the cells for 6 h and then 1.5 ml of media containing 2 × fetal calf serum (20%) was added for an additional 14 h. Cells were assayed at the times indicated. Luciferase activity was assayed using a kit purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) and a luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Cells were removed from dishes by incubation with lysis buffer (25 mM Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM 1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) for 15 min followed by scraping. A 4-μl aliquot from each 35-mm dish was used for one luciferase assay. Data for luciferase activity represent total values from all cells on one dish. In each experiment, three dishes were used for each condition. Sixteen to 36 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 1.8% formaldehyde and 2% gluteraldehyde and then incubated for 16 h. at 37°C with 0.313 μl of 40 mg/ml X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside) in Me2SO dissolved in 12.5 ml of PBS (pH 7.8). Blue staining of nuclei was evaluated by light microscopy. Results are expressed as a percentage; at least 1000 cells were counted in each experiment. To assess the percentage of cells in which ethidium-labeled DNA entered the cell, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Transfected cells were rinsed three times with PBS, released from the substrate by incubation for 10 min with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mM EDTA, and then resuspended in Eagle's MEM. After centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was discarded and the cells were resuspended in 500 μl of PBS. Fluorescence from 10,000 individual cells was analyzed (FACScan, Lysys II software, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The percentage of cells containing labeled DNA was assessed by determining the percentage of highly fluorescent cells in each group and subtracting the fluorescence of control cells that were exposed to the labeled DNA without the cationic lipid. Transfected cells were thoroughly washed with PBS and scraped into 200 μl PBS. Cells were freeze/thawed three times to release the DNA. The suspension was spun at 14,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was applied to a nitrocellulose filter with a vacuum blotter. The filters were exposed to UV light for 2 min to link the DNA to the filter and then were probed with a 32P-labeled plasmid. Results were analyzed by autoradiography, and radioactivity was quantitated with an AMBIS (San Diego, CA) radioanalytic scanner. Cells labeled with ethidium-DNA and the Texas Red probes were imaged using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser. The ethidium-DNA fluorescence was most efficiently excited using 488 nm illumination, while the Texas Red labeled samples were imaged using the 568 nm line. Transmitted light images of each field were also collected. The images were transferred to a UNIX workstation for merging, annotation, and printing. The DMRIE-isatoic ester labeled samples were photographed using a Zeiss IM-35 with a 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole filter set. The images were digitized and were also transferred to the workstation for merging, annotation, and printing. To study endocytosis of other markers, COS-1 cells were cultured on collagen-coated four-well (2 cm2 each) glass slides. Following a DMEM wash, 500 μl of each fluorescent probe solution was placed on the cells for 4-6 h. The cultures were then washed in DMEM, covered with COS media, and returned to the incubator. At 24 h. the cells were washed in PBS, pH 7.4, and fixed in 2% freshly prepared formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. The slides were then rinsed three times in PBS and once in double-distilled H2O and, following removal of the wells, mounted in Gel/Mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). Lipid-DNA complexes were processed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a negative stain/rotary shadow technique. Fifteen-μl drops of freshly prepared samples were placed on glow-discharged collodion/carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grids for 3 min. Solution was wicked off with filter paper and replaced with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 30 s. After removal of the solution, grids were rinsed in double-distilled H2O and allowed to dry. Rotary shadowing was performed using 1 inch of 0.008-inch Pt/Pd 60/40 wire at a 7° angle. Grids were imaged in a Hitachi H-7000 TEM. To follow the cellular entry and fate of DNA, COS cells were transfected with gold-labeled DNA complexed with DMRIE/DOPE at a 1:5 (w/w) ratio. Cells were fixed at various times in 2.5% gluteraldehyde and processed using standard EM procedures. Briefly, the samples were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, followed by 2.5% aqueous uranyl acetate, and then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol washes. Thin sections (70 nm) of the Eponate 12-embedded specimen were placed on 135-mesh hexagonal copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate. To identify lysosomes, we localized acid phosphatase(47Barka T. Anderson P.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1962; 10: 741Crossref Google Scholar). After treatment with the lipid-DNA-gold complex, cells were fixed in 2% gluteraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, at 4°C for 1 h. Cultures were then rinsed three times for 10 min in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer at room temperature, rinsed three times for 10 min in Tris-maleic buffer, pH 5.0, at 37°C, and incubated in reaction solution consisting of 0.25% sodium β-glycerophosphate and 0.08% lead nitrate in Tris-maleic buffer for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were rinsed in Tris-maleic buffer and cacodylate buffer as above, post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide for 1 h, and processed for TEM as described previously. Ovarian lobes were surgically removed from adult albino Xenopus laevis females. The isolated oocytes were rinsed in Ca2+-free modified Barth's solution (MBS), and the follicles were removed using collagenase at 2 mg/ml (Sigma, Type 1A). The defolliculated oocytes were maintained in MBS at 17°C prior to injection(28Colman A. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Transcription and Translation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1984: 271-300Google Scholar). Healthy oocytes were injected with 1.5-10 nl of either plasmid (pMT3-SEAP) alone or plasmid complexed with DMRIE/DOPE using a pressure microinjector (Narishige USA, IM-200). The concentration of plasmid injected was constant at 0.03 μg/μl for all nuclear and cytoplasmic injections. The concentration of DMRIE/DOPE was varied as indicated. The lipid and plasmid were mixed in TE buffer and incubated at room temperature for a minimum of 15 min before injection. Each injected oocyte was placed into a 96-well flat-bottom culture plate containing 0.2 ml of MBS and incubated at 17°C for 3 days. The amount of alkaline phosphatase secreted into the culture medium for each injected oocyte was assayed as described elsewhere(29Tate S.S. Urade R. Micanovic R. Gerber L. Udenfriend S. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An absorbance reading at 405 nm was taken using an automatic plate reader 30 min after the substrate, p-nitrophenylphosphate, was added to the assay. In previous studies using DMRIE/DOPE(4Felgner J.H. Kumar R. Sridhar C.N. Wheeler C.J. Tsai Y.J. Border R. Ramsey P. Martin M. Felgner P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2550-2561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fasbender A.J. Zabner J. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), transfection was optimal when the charge ratio of DMRIE/DOPE to DNA was slightly positive, i.e. when the charge ratio was approximately 1 to 1.2, corresponding to a weight:weight ratio of total lipid-DNA of approximately 5:1. To assess the structure of this complex, we used electron microscopy with negative staining and rotary shadowing of the complexes. This method has been modified from the Kleinschmidt method that is classically used for electron microscopic imaging of DNA (30Coggins L.W. Sommerville J. Scheer U. Electron Microscopy in Molecular Biology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 1-13Google Scholar) in order to avoid excessive shearing, to prevent changes in lipid configuration that could result from exposure to alcohol, and to avoid changes in the complex that might result from adding high concentrations (0.4 mg/ml) of another cationic molecule, cytochrome c. Although the preparation had been optimized for transfection, we were surprised to find a very heterogeneous population of complexes. Fig. 1A shows free DNA that has not been complexed with lipid, and Fig. 1(B-F) show examples of the type of lipid-DNA particles we observed. In some cases the DNA appeared to be compacted into relatively dense particles, but as shown in Fig. 1B, compacted and free DNA could be observed in the same field. Often when dense aggregates were observed, DNA also appeared to extend from the complex, forming looped structures (Fig. 1E). In some cases the DNA appeared to be free (Fig. 1D), and in other cases it may have been coated with lipid to form an extended structure (Fig. 1E). In some cases, relatively large aggregates appeared to form (Fig. 1C), and less frequently we saw strands of complexes (Fig. 1F). The complexes were quite heterogeneous, although the most frequently observed complexes resembled those in Fig. 1(B and E). In all cases the complexes appeared to be at least 100 nm or larger, at least in one dimension. Gershon and colleagues (31Gershon H. Ghirlando R. Guttman S.B. Minsky A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7143-7151Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) have also imaged lipid-DNA complexes formed from calf thymus DNA or plasmid DNA complexed with an equimolar mixture of N-1-[2,3-bis(oleoyloxy)]propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA) and phosphatidylethanolamine. At a lipid-DNA charge ratio of 1.0, they showed an electron photomicrograph of a rod-like complex approximately 700 nm long, which most closely resembled the structures indicated by solidarrows in Fig. 1B of the present study. However, there was no indication of the substantial heterogeneity that we observed. Besides the difference in lipid, one additional difference between our study and theirs is that they used the Kleinschmidt method(30Coggins L.W. Sommerville J. Scheer U. Electron Microscopy in Molecular Biology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 1-13Google Scholar), whereas we used a much different method to place the sample on the grid. At present we do not know whether one or all of the various forms of complex shown in Fig. 1 is the most efficient transfection particle. However, methods designed to produce homogeneous complexes and to identify the complex(s) that is most effective at transfection could provide an important advance in improving gene transfer. The first step of transfection is entry of the DNA into the cells. To evaluate this step, we complexed DMRIE/DOPE with DNA that had been covalently labeled with ethidium monoazide. We exposed cells to the complex for varying intervals, removed the complex by rinsing, released the cells from the substrate, and then used FACS to determine the percentage of cells that had taken up the labeled DNA. Fig. 2 shows histograms of fluorescence intensity versus number of COS cells following increasing durations of exposure to DMRIE/DOPE•DNA (5:1, w/w ratio). After 30 min of exposure, less than 5% of the cells showed fluorescence above background. However, with increasing duration of exposure, the percentage of fluorescent cells increased, suggesting that the process of DNA entry into the cells is relatively slow. The low freq"

Although the anterior eye tissues, the cornea and lens, filter out the most damaging components of solar radiation(1Lerman S. Ben Hur E. Rosenthal I. Photomedicine. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 79-121Google Scholar), the retina can be subjected to intense illumination from focal light that includes the relatively energetic photons from the blue part of the solar spectrum (2Young R.W. Surv. Ophthalmol. 1988; 32: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (334) Google Scholar). As a result, photic retinopathy may develop(3Yannuzzi Y.L. Fisher A. Krueger A. Slateter J. Trans. Am.

The primary lesion associated with photoreceptor degeneration and loss of vision in ARM is believed to be located in the RPE(8Green W.R. McDonnel P.J. Yeo J.H. Ophthalmology. 1985; 92: 615-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). However, no key chromophores that trigger primary events in either light-induced phenomena have been identified yet(9Sarna T. Róz anowska M. Jori G. Pottier R.H. Rodgers M.A.J. Truscott T.G. Photobiology in Medicine. Plenum Press, New York1994: 125-141Crossref Google Scholar). Among several potential photosensitizing molecules that are normally present in human RPE, melanin and lipofuscin deserve special attention. These two pigments, present in the cell exclusively in the particle form, have broad optical absorption bands(10Sarna T. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1992; 12: 215-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Their biogenesis is very different; whereas RPE melanin appears very early in the fetal development(11Feeney-Burns L. Zadunaisky J.A. Dawson H. Current Topics in Eye Research. Academic Press, New York1980: 119-178Google Scholar), RPE lipofuscin becomes apparent only during the second decade of life and accumulates with age(12Weiter J.J. Delori F.C. Wing G.L. Fitch K.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1986; 27: 145-152PubMed Google Scholar). Even though melanin can photogenerate superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide(13Sarna T. Swartz H.M. Scott G. Atmospheric Oxidation and Antioxidants. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1993: 129-166Crossref Google Scholar), it is believed that under typical in vivo conditions, melanin acts as an efficient antioxidant(10Sarna T. J.

In this regard little is known about the photosensitizing abilities of lipofuscin, except that this age pigment stimulates photoreduction of cytochrome c under aerobic conditions, which suggests possible photoformation of superoxide anion(14Boulton M.

To determine whether the human RPE exhibits any substantial photoreactivity that may lead to retinal phototoxicity, we measured action spectra of photoinduced oxygen uptake and photoformation of hydrogen peroxide for RPE cells. In a search for the major retinal chromophores responsible for the observed RPE photoreactivity, we studied aerobic photoreactions in suspensions of purified retinal lipofuscin and melanin granules and identified some products of the interaction of photoexcited lipofuscin with oxygen. Chemicals (at least reagent grade, unless otherwise stated) were purchased from Aldrich, Merck, or Sigma and used as supplied. Catalase (thymol-free) and superoxide dismutase (lyophilized powder) from bovine liver were purchased from Sigma. mHCTPO was a gift from Prof. H. J. Halpern (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL) and used as received. To minimize paramagnetic contaminations, DMPO was redistilled in vacuo before use. Phosphate buffer was treated with Chelex 100 prior to use. RPE cells were removed from the posterior poles of human and bovine eyes, and from flasks of confluent human RPE cultures (4th passage) with a rubber scraper and suspended at 1-3 mg of protein/ml of phosphate-buffered saline(15Burke J.M. Soref C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1988; 29: 1784-1788PubMed Google Scholar). All results of experiments with cells were normalized to equal protein content of the RPE cells as determined by the Lowry method(16Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human eyes were obtained from Wisconsin Lion Eye Bank or Manchester Eye Bank (United Kingdom), and bovine eyes from a local slaughterhouse. Lipofuscin, melanolipofuscin, and melanosome granules were isolated from RPE cells from 60-70-year-old individuals according to a procedure previously described (17Boulton M.E. Docchio F. Dayhaw-Barker P. Ramponi R. Cubeddu R. Vis. Res. 1990; 9: 1291-1303Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar) except that mechanical homogenization was used instead of ultrasonication. Isolated granules were suspended in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and dispersed by forcing them through a narrow gauge needle. Concentration of the granules was determined by counting on a hemeocytometer. Typical concentration of the pigment granules used in experiments was in the range (0.5 − 1.5) × 109/ml. The amount of melanin in the samples studied was determined by the ESR melanin assay(18Enochs W.S. Nilges M.J. Swartz H.M. Pigment Cell Res. 1993; 6: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). ESR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer operating at 9.5 GHz with 100 kHz field modulation. The ESR signal intensities of acidified (pH 1) samples were compared at liquid nitrogen temperature using a measured amount of synthetic 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine melanin as a standard. Action spectra of oxygen photoconsumption and hydrogen peroxide photoformation were obtained using monochromatic light from a compact arc, high pressure mercury lamp (Oriel PhotoMax 200 W) equipped with a combination of narrow-band interference and broad band filters (effective fluence rate at the sample surface was 5-29 mW/cm2 with bandwidth ~10 nm). Rates of photo-dependent oxygen uptake were obtained by measuring kinetics of oxygen concentration changes in irradiated samples. In these measurements ESR oximetry was employed using 10−4M CTPO or mHCTPO as the nitroxide spin probes(19Halpern H.J. Peric M. Nguyen T.-D. Spencer D. Tercher B.A. Lin Y.J. Bowman M.K. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 90: 40-51Google Scholar, 20Sarna T. Duleba A. Korytowski W. Swartz H.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 200: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Samples in flat quartz cells (0.25 mm) were illuminated in situ, in a resonant cavity, at ambient temperature. Instrument settings were: microwave power, 1 mW; modulation amplitude, 0.1 G (for mHCTPO) or 0.05 G (for CTPO). Rates of H2O2 formation were determined at 4°C in order to minimize decomposition of H2O2. Samples were illuminated in a thermostated optical chamber of a miniature oxygen monitor (Instech Laboratories, Horsham, PA). Aliquots of granule suspension were taken during sample illumination, and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was measured using an oxidase electrode (Yellow Spring Instruments Co. (YSI), Yellow Springs, OH) as described previously(21Korytowski W. Pilas B. Sarna T. Kalyanaraman B. Photochem. Photobiol. 1987; 45: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Blue light effects (photo-dependent uptake of oxygen and photoformation of hydrogen peroxide by RPE cells, and photoformation of lipid hydroperoxides by isolated pigment granules) were studied upon illumination derived from a compact arc, high pressure xenon lamp (Varian Eimac VIX 300 UV) with a combination of cut-off and broad band filters; effective spectral range: 408-495 nm, fluence rate ~220 mW/cm2, unless stated otherwise. Stoichiometry of O2 consumption and hydrogen peroxide formation by isolated pigment granules was determined by monitoring initial depletion of oxygen and formation of H2O2 following onset of the sample illumination. Consumption of oxygen was measured at 4°C using a miniature oxygen electrode (Instech Laboratories, Horsham, PA) and a thermostated closed optical chamber. Rates of H2O2 formation were determined in the same way as for the action spectrum of hydrogen peroxide formation. To minimize enzymatic decomposition of formed H2O2, cells were pretreated for 3 h at 4°C with 1.0 mM sodium azide. The DMPO spin probe (200 mM) was used as a spin trap for the detection of superoxide anion(22Rosen G.M. Finkelstein M.D. Adv. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1985; 1: 345-375Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Time course of DMPO adducts formation, and their decay, was followed to distinguish between primary and secondary products. Superoxide dismutase was used as an additional test for superoxide anion formation(23Fridovich I. Pryor W.A. Free Radicals in Biology. Academic Press, New York1976: 239-277Crossref Google Scholar), and the involvement of hydrogen peroxide was assessed by carrying out measurements in the presence of catalase. Total concentration of lipofuscin-derived LOOH was measured by iodometric assay(24Pryor W.A. Castle L. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), after chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), extraction of lipids from irradiated and control samples. MDA was analyzed using the thiobarbituric acid assay followed by HPLC separation and fluorometric determination (λexc = 523 nm, λem = 550 nm) of MDA-thiobarbituric acid complex, as described elsewhere(25Draper H.H. Squires E.J. Mahmoodi H. Wu J. Agarwal S. Hadley M. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Cholesterol was used as an acceptor of singlet oxygen that gives characteristic oxidation products with O2(1Δg): 5α-OOH, 6α-OOH, and 6β-OOH(26Foote C.S. Doiron D.R. Gomer C.J. Porphyrin Localization and Treatment of Tumors. Alan R. Liss, New York1984: 3-18Google Scholar). Lipofuscin (6 × 108 granules/ml) was preincubated with unilamellar liposomes (5 mM total lipids) for 48 h at 4°C. Liposomes, composed of DMPC/cholesterol/DCP (1:1:0.05) were prepared as described previously (27Girotti A.W. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 497-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Complete samples containing desferrioxamine (0.1 mM) to minimize metal-ion catalyzed free radical processes were irradiated at 4°C with a halogen lamp. Incident light intensity was 2000 W/m2 as measured at the surface of the sample. Copper sulfate (100 g/ml) and 408 nm cut-off filters were used to eliminate light below 408 nm and infrared. At selected irradiation times, samples were collected, and lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) in the presence of 1 mM EDTA and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC-EC as described(28Korytowski W. Bachowski G.J. Girotti A.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Fluence rates were routinely measured using a model 65A YSI radiometer and/or a calibrated silicon photodiode (Hamamatsu, Photonics, K.K.). The rate of photo-dependent O2 uptake in suspensions of RPE cells in phosphate-buffered saline was wavelength-dependent, the oxygen uptake being greatest at the shortest wavelength studied (290 nm) and decreasing by more than 50-fold at 578 nm (Fig. 1). Isolated human RPE cells demonstrated approximately 40-60-fold greater rate of uptake of oxygen in the range 406-432 nm than cultured depigmented human RPE cells (data not shown). When normalized to equal protein content and illuminated at 406 nm, RPE cells isolated from human eyes photoconsumed oxygen 8 times faster than bovine RPE cells isolated from the hypomelanotic tapetal region and about 15 times faster than those from the pigmented peripheral fundus (Fig. 1). Different slopes of the lines, drawn through data points obtained for photo-dependent oxygen uptake for pigmented and nonpigmented bovine RPE cells, may indicate that different chromophores are responsible for the observed phenomena in both cell types. Alternatively, the observed difference may be due to melanin-related optical screening in the pigmented cells. The ESR assay demonstrated that pigmented bovine RPE cells from the peripheral fundus contained at least 100 times more melanin than tapetal non-pigmented cells and 3-5 times more than human RPE cells (Fig. 1, inset). Therefore, the rate of oxygen consumption in RPE cells does not correlate with the amount of melanin present in the cells. Neither catalase (0.15 mg/ml) nor superoxide dismutase (0.10 mg/ml) had any measurable effect on the rate of photo-dependent oxygen uptake, while lipid-soluble antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene and α-tocopherol (0.2 mM each) only partially inhibited photo-dependent uptake of oxygen. Analysis of blue light photoreactivity observed in human RPE cells, isolated from individuals 16-97 years of age, demonstrated a marked increase in the rate of photo-dependent oxygen uptake as the donor age increased (Fig. 2A), and only a modest change in the corresponding rate of hydrogen peroxide photoproduction (Fig. 2B). The data also indicate that hydrogen peroxide is only a minor product of aerobic photoactivation of human RPE cells, accounting for no more than 6% of the oxygen consumed. Since lipofuscin and melanin granules are major chromophores that efficiently absorb visible and near-ultraviolet radiation in the adult human RPE, we compared the rates of light-induced oxygen consumption and H2O2 formation in purified populations of these pigment granules (Fig. 3), isolated from donors 60-70 years of age. The efficiency of both photoprocesses in either pigment granule type exhibited strong wavelength dependence. When normalized to an equal concentration of pigment granules and number of incident photons at 406 nm, lipofuscin induced almost 6 times faster uptake of O2 than melanin, with melanolipofuscin being intermediate. Rates of photoinduced oxygen consumption (mM/s) were as follows: 0.547 ± 0.110 (lipofuscin), 0.095 ± 0.022 (melanosomes), and 0.297 ± 0.071 (melanolipofuscin). It should be noted that the wavelength dependence of the rate of oxygen consumption for purified lipofuscin granules is similar to that determined for RPE cells (Fig. 1). The involvement of O2(1Δg) in photo-oxidation of lipofuscin has unambiguously been shown by product analysis using cholesterol as an acceptor of O2(1Δg). HPLC-EC of ChOOHs, obtained after illumination of DMPC/cholesterol/DCP liposomes, in the presence of lipofuscin, showed five major ChOOH products formed in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 4). Three of them: 5α-OOH, 6α-OOH, and 6β-OOH, eluted as single peaks, are characteristic products of the interaction of cholesterol with singlet oxygen. Two others, eluted as partially resolved peaks, can be identified as 7α/7β-OOH epimers. The latter can be formed via rearrangement of 5α-ChOOH or as a result of free radical chain-reactions(27Girotti A.W. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 497-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). None of these products has been detected in liposomes exposed to light in the absence of lipofuscin (Fig. 4D) or in unirradiated sample (Fig. 4A). Using the ESR spin-trapping technique and DMPO as the spin trap, characteristic spin adducts were detected when a suspension of lipofuscin was illuminated with blue light (Fig. 5A). The ESR spectrum, observed after 6 min of illumination time, has been simulated assuming superposition of two nitroxide species, one with the corresponding hyperfine coupling constants being AN = 14.3 G, AβH = 11.7 G, AγH = 1.25 G, and the other with AN = AH = 14.9 G (Fig. 5B). Aside from noise, which is apparent only in the experimental spectrum, the simulated and experimental spectra match quite well. Clearly, the formed spin adducts can be identified as DMPO-OH and DMPO-OOH, respectively(29Buettner B. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 259-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). The latter can be ascribed as being due to the interaction of superoxide anion (O) with DMPO. This relatively unstable spin adduct decays within minutes, via complex reactions, to a long-lived DMPO-OH adduct(22Rosen G.M. Finkelstein M.D. Adv. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1985; 1: 345-375Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Consistently with the proposed scheme, the DMPO-OOH concentration depended on the presence of oxygen (no signal detected in absence of oxygen) (Fig. 6C) and could not be detected in samples with added superoxide dismutase (Fig. 6A). Catalase alone, on the other hand, had no effect on the intensity of the DMPO-OOH signal formed during aerobic illumination of the lipofuscin samples (data not shown). However, our data suggest that at least 50% of the observed ESR signal, assigned to DMPO-OH, is not related to the formation of DMPO-OOH. This is evident from data shown in Fig. 6A, in which the formation of DMPO-OH is apparent even in the presence of superoxide dismutase, where no superoxide anion could be detected.Figure 6:The effect of inclusion of superoxide dismutase (0.10 mg/ml) (A), both superoxide dismutase and catalase (0.15 mg/ml, about 1900 units/ml) (B) and oxygen removal (C) on formation of DMPO spin adduct during illumination of ESR sample containing lipofuscin suspension in the presence of DMPO. Experimental conditions and instrumental settings the same as in Fig. 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The mechanism of DMPO-OH generation during aerobic illumination of lipofuscin is unknown at present. Interestingly, the spin adduct appears to be H2O2-independent, since it is also formed in the presence of catalase (Fig. 6B). Illumination of lipofuscin granules with blue light yielded measurable concentrations of hydroperoxides (Fig. 7A). An apparent decrease in the hydroperoxide content, observed at longer illumination times, indicates that the resulting kinetics is a superposition of two processes: photo-induced formation and decomposition of hydroperoxides. This conclusion is consistent with the observed monotonic accumulation of MDA, a nonspecific indicator of lipid peroxidation(30Gutteridge J.M.C. Quinlan G.J. J. Appl. Biochem. 1983; 5: 293-299PubMed Google Scholar), that accompanied the formation of hydroperoxides (Fig. 7B). The observed photoreactivity of human RPE cells is, to a significant extent, determined by their lipofuscin content. This is evident from the comparison of action spectra of photo-dependent oxygen uptake in RPE cells and in purified lipofuscin granules (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:). Both action spectra exhibit significant similarities in that the efficiency of illuminating light, to induce oxygen uptake and generation of H2O2, falls steeply with the wavelength between 300 and 600 nm. Thus, blue light seems to be the most efficient radiation under physiologically relevant conditions. This is because ultraviolet radiation is completely filtered out by the cornea and lens of the adult human eye and, as a result, virtually no light below 400 nm is transmitted to the retina(1Lerman S. Ben Hur E. Rosenthal I. Photomedicine. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 79-121Google Scholar). Retinal melanin does not seem to be the major contributor to photo-dependent oxygen uptake in either human RPE cells or bovine pigment epithelium, which may prove that lipofuscin is a major retinal chromophore that photoexcitation leads to consumption of oxygen. Such a conclusion about the dominant role of lipofuscin in aerobic photoreactions of human RPE is further supported by the distinct changes of the RPE photoreactivity with age of the donors (Fig. 2). The increase in the rate of photo-dependent oxygen uptake between the second and ninth decade of life, observed in this work, is consistent with the reported accumulation of retinal lipofuscin with age(12Weiter J.J. Delori F.C. Wing G.L. Fitch K.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1986; 27: 145-152PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of lipofuscin, or its precursors, may also account for photo-dependent oxygen uptake, albeit reduced, in bovine RPE cells. It must be stressed that the molecular nature of chromophores of human RPE lipofuscin responsible for its photoreactivity remains unknown. Melanolipofuscin granules exhibit aerobic photoreactivity which is intermediate between that of lipofuscin and melanin. However, the contribution of melanolipofuscin to photo-induced consumption of oxygen, observed in RPE cells, is difficult to evaluate. One has to consider that in human RPE a significant number of these complex granules become apparent in individuals 60-100 years of age, when lipofuscin granules are more numerous than any other pigment granules (31Feeney-Burns L. Hilderbrand E.S. Eldridge S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1984; 25: 195-200PubMed Google Scholar). Since superoxide anion has been detected in irradiated lipofuscin samples (Fig. 5), it is conceivable that O may be a major intermediate in lipofuscin-photosensitized generation of H2O2. However, our data clearly show that in isolated pigment granules photo-induced consumption of oxygen is not accompanied by stoichiometric production of H2O2 (Fig. 3). Since similar results have been observed for RPE cells, we may conclude that an identical or closely related mechanism of photo-dependent oxygen uptake occurs in isolated pigment granules and in RPE cells. Molecular oxygen consumed during illumination of RPE cells may in part be utilized in lipid peroxidation processes. This can be inferred from the detection of hydroperoxides that were induced by blue light in purified lipofuscin granules (Fig. 4), even though the yield of photoformation of lipofuscin-derived hydroperoxides, as well as that of the accompanying accumulation of MDA, has not been determined in this work. An important question is the identity of reactive species that initiate lipofuscin-sensitized photoperoxidation, and lead to the observable photoconsumption of O2. Two major mechanisms of lipid peroxidation should be considered: the free radical and singlet oxygen pathways(27Girotti A.W. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 497-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Our ESR spin-trapping data and the observed formation of both 7α-OOH and 7β-OOH epimers, seem to indicate that the free radical mechanism operates. Although superoxide anion is rather a nonreactive species, and in aqueous media acts predominantly as a moderate reductant(32Bielski B.H.J. Cabelli D.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1991; 59: 291-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), its protonated form, the hydroperoxyl radical, can attack double-allylic hydrogen atoms in a number of unsaturated fatty acids(33Bielski B.H.J. Arudi R.J. Sutherland M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4759-4761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, powerful antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxytoluene and α-tocopherol, only partially inhibited the photo-dependent uptake of O2. It may suggest that peroxidation, induced in lipofuscin granules by light, is mostly a non-radical process or a mixed-type process, in which singlet oxygen is involved. In such processes oxygen is consumed during the primary formation of lipid hydroperoxides, while the secondary chain-propagating reactions are less efficient(34Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989: 188-276Google Scholar). However, at this point it cannot be ruled out that the relatively small inhibitory effect of tested antioxidants on photo-dependent uptake of oxygen, is also due to their inefficient penetration of the lipofuscin granule. Due to the particle character of lipofuscin and the molecular heterogeneity of its main constituents, quantitative determination of reactive species, which may be generated by lipofuscin granules, is rather difficult. One has to realize that any short-lived species, generated within the lipofuscin granule, are likely to be scavenged or quenched by several reactive lipofuscin components, before having chance to diffuse out of the granule. Therefore, the yield of photoformation of reactive species, such as singlet oxygen, determined by its interaction with a selective acceptor, homogeneously distributed in the entire sample volume, would be severely underestimated. The situation can be improved if a suitable acceptor of O2(1Δg) is preferentially located in the granule or in its close proximity. Indeed, singlet oxygen photoformation has unambiguously been detected by the chemical method using cholesterol as an exogenous singlet oxygen acceptor (Fig. 4). However, at this stage we cannot determine quantum yield of the formation of O2(1Δg) by lipofuscin. In conclusion, human RPE lipofuscin exhibits substantial photoreactivity and, under aerobic conditions, is able to form several potentially cytotoxic species. It is important to stress that these are typical conditions for a normally functioning eye; the RPE in vivo is constantly exposed to high oxygen tension and must endure substantial fluxes of light that reach the posterior eye segments(35Weiter J. Miller D. Clinical Light Damage to the Eye. Springer Verlag, New York1987: 79-125Crossref Google Scholar). The extent to which the long term effects of lipofuscin photoreactivity affect the structural integrity and function of the RPE-retinal complex in vivo has yet to be elucidated, as has its role in ARM.

https://openalex.org/W2060799932,"c-Myc is a helix-loop-helix leucine zipper phosphoprotein that heterodimerizes with Max and regulates gene transcription in cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and programmed cell death. Previously, we demonstrated that c-Myc is modified by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) within or nearby the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain (Chou, T.-Y., Dang, C. V., and Hart, G. W.(1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 92, 4417-4421). In this paper, we identified the O-GlcNAc attachment site(s) on c-Myc. c-Myc purified from sf9 insect cells was trypsinized, and its GlcNAc moieties were enzymically labeled with [3H]galactose. The [3H]galactose-labeled glycopeptides were isolated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and then subjected to gas-phase sequencing, manual Edman degradation, and laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. These analyses show that threonine 58, an in vivo phosphorylation site in the transactivation domain, is the major O-GlcNAc glycosylation site of c-Myc. Mutation of threonine 58, frequently found in retroviral v-Myc proteins and in human Burkitt and AIDS-related lymphomas, is associated with enhanced transforming activity and tumorigenicity. The reciprocal glycosylation and phosphorylation at this biologically significant amino acid residue may play an important role in the regulation of the functions of c-Myc. c-Myc is a helix-loop-helix leucine zipper phosphoprotein that heterodimerizes with Max and regulates gene transcription in cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and programmed cell death.

The reciprocal glycosylation and phosphorylation at this biologically significant amino acid residue may play an important role in the regulation of the functions of c-Myc. c-Myc, the product of the c-myc protooncogene, is a nuclear phosphoprotein of 439 amino acids that plays a critical role in the regulation of gene transcription in normal and neoplastic cells. Mutations of c-myc are associated with different types of tumors in human and other species(1Kato G.J. Dang C.V. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3065-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). c-Myc has several structural features conserved among many transcription factors. A basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper motif in the C-terminal region mediates heterodimerization with Max (2Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N.

Phosphorylation at Thr-58 and/or Ser-62 in the TAD of c-Myc has been suggested to modulate the transactivation (11Albert T. Urlbauer B. Kohlhuber F. Hammersen B. Eick D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 759-763PubMed Google Scholar) and cellular transformation (12Pulverer B.J. Fisher C. Vousden K. Littlewood T. Evan G. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 59-70PubMed Google Scholar) by c-Myc. Our previous study (13Chou T.-Y. Dang C.V. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) showed that the TAD of c-Myc is also modified by O-GlcNAc, a form of protein glycosylation composed of a single monosaccharide, GlcNAc, linked to the side chain hydroxyl of serine or threonine(14Hart G.W. Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Kelly W.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 841-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc has been found almost exclusively in the nucleus and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. The known O-GlcNAc-bearing proteins share two common features; all of them are phosphoproteins and all form reversible multimeric complexes. Although the role of O-GlcNAc in altering protein function remains unknown, experiments to date suggest that the O-GlcNAc modification is dynamic and appears to have a reciprocal relationship with protein phosphorylation(15Hart G.W. Kelly W.G. Blomberg M.A. Roquemore E.P. Dong L.-Y.D. Kreppel L. Chou T.-Y. Snow D. Greis K. 44. Colloquium Mosbach 1993 Glyco- and Cell Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 91-103Google Scholar). In this report, using a variety of analytical techniques on c-Myc overexpressed in insect cells, we provide evidence that O-GlcNAc occurs at c-Myc threonine 58, a known phosphorylation site and a frequently mutated hot spot in human lymphomas. sf9 insect cells were from Paragon. Monoclonal mouse anti-Myc antibody 9E10 was from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Sequencing grade trypsin (tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated) was from Worthington. UDP-[6-3H]galactose (38 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Corp. Bovine milk galactosyltransferase from Sigma (37.2 units/ml) was pregalactosylated as described(16Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8049-8057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest quality commercially available. sf9 insect cells grown in suspension culture were infected with recombinant baculovirus Ac373/hc-myc ((17Miyamoto C. Smith G.E.

Department of Entomology, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station and Texas A & University, College Station, TX1987Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 40 h postinfection, and the c-Myc protein was purified as described by Papoulas, Williams, and Kingston (19Papoulas O. Williams N.G. Kingston R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10470-10480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some changes. Briefly, ~1 × 1010 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended at 2.5 × 107 cells/ml in low salt lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 6.8, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mM PMSF, 50 mM GlcNAc). After 10 min cells were subjected to 40 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with a type A pestle. Nuclei were pelleted at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C, washed once in low salt lysis buffer, resuspended at 2 × 108 nuclei/ml in low salt lysis buffer containing 600 units/ml DNase I, and incubated at 4°C for 2 h. An equal volume of 2 × high salt lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 4 M NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM GlcNAc) was added, mixed, and incubated for 10 min. The residual nuclear material was pelleted at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, resuspended for solubilization at 5 × 107 nuclear eq/ml in buffer A (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM PMSF, 5 M urea), vigorously stirred on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was loaded at 0.1 ml/min on a 80-ml DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (Sigma) column pre-equilibrated with 5 column volumes of buffer A. After loading, the column was washed at 0.4 ml/min with 3 volumes of buffer A and then 4 volumes of buffer A containing 0.15 M NaCl. c-Myc was eluted by buffer A containing 0.35 M NaCl. The c-Myc-containing fractions were pooled and diluted with buffer A to 0.1 M NaCl and loaded at 0.5 ml/min onto a 1-ml fast protein liquid chromatography Mono Q column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1 M NaCl. The column was eluted in buffer A with a programmed gradient of 0.1-2 M NaCl. The c-Myc was eluted at 0.2-0.4 M NaCl, and the c-Myc containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 50 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mM PMSF in bags of SpectroPor 2 membrane for four changes of 1 liter each and for 6 h each. All purification steps were carried out on ice or with ice-cold buffers. Purified c-Myc was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, stained with silver staining, or transferred to nitrocellulose paper for Western blot analysis using monoclonal mouse anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (ATCC). Purified c-Myc was digested with trypsin at a ratio of 1:10 trypsin to protein (dissolved in 1 mM HCl) in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, at 37°C for 18 h. The reaction mixture was acidified by adding 10% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid to make a final concentration of 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters). The tryptic peptides were eluted with 60% (v/v) acetonitrile, dried, resuspended in 80 μl of H2O, and labeled by galactosyltransferase (20Roquemore E.P. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) in labeling buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mMD(+)-galactose, 5 mM MnCl2) with 50 μCi of UDP-[3H]galactose and 0.1 unit of galactosyltransferase at 37°C for 4 h. Another 0.1 unit of galactosyltransferase and 5 μg of UDP-galactose were added after 1 h of incubation. The labeled tryptic peptides were purified by a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge. The 60% (v/v) acetonitrile eluent was dried and applied to RP-HPLC. [3H]Galactose-labeled glycopeptides were isolated by three rounds of RP-HPLC on a Rainin HPLC system equipped with a Vydac 5-μm C18 column (0.46 × 25 cm). Glycopeptides were loaded onto the column with 0.5 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (first dimension), 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2.0 (second dimension), or 0.1% (w/v) ammonium acetate, pH 4.0 (third dimension) and eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile from 0 to 60% (v/v). The flow rate was 1 ml/min, the eluent was monitored by absorbance at λ = 214 nm, fractions were collected every minute, and the [3H]galactose-labeled glycopeptides were detected by liquid scintillation counting. Isolated [3H]galactose-labeled glycopeptides from the third dimension RP-HPLC were sequenced by automated Edman degradation in a model 470A gas-phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Aliquots of isolated [3H]galactose-labeled glycopeptides from the third dimension RP-HPLC were subjected to the manual Edman degradation method of Sullivan and Wong (21Sullivan S. Wong T.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with modifications as described by Kelly et al.(22Kelly W.G. Dahmus M.E. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10416-10424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) was performed on a linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer built in-house and described previously by Chevrier and Cotter(23Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1991; 5: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). c-Myc protein levels have been shown to be very low in normal and transformed cells through the use of immunological assays(24Moore J.P. Hancock D.C. Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Oncogene Res. 1987; 2: 65-80PubMed Google Scholar). There are approximately 750 molecules of c-Myc per cell in serum-starved fibroblasts. After serum stimulation, the number increases to 6,300 per cell. HeLa cells, which are transformed, contain ~97,000 molecules of c-Myc per cell. The levels of cellular c-Myc polypeptide appear to be constant throughout the cell cycle(25Hann S.R. Thompson C.B. Eisenman R.N. Nature. 1985; 314: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The low abundance of c-Myc and the inherent limitation of the sensitivity of tritium labeling render the detection of carbohydrate moieties on c-Myc and the subsequent mapping of carbohydrate sites on c-Myc extremely difficult. In our previous work(13Chou T.-Y. Dang C.V. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), we developed sensitive methods to detect O-GlcNAc on in vitro translated c-Myc and identified a N-terminal region of c-Myc modified by O-GlcNAc. We also overexpressed the c-Myc protein in either sf9 insect cells or Chinese hamster ovary cells and demonstrated that c-Myc expressed in these cells is modified by O-GlcNAc. In the present study, we used c-Myc overexpressed in sf9 insect cells to map the O-GlcNAc addition sites of c-Myc. It is estimated that sf9 insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus Ac373/hc-myc (17Miyamoto C. Smith G.E. Farrell-Towt J. Chizzonite R. Summers M.D. Ju G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2860-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) express more than 1 million molecules of c-Myc per cell (data not shown), an amount at least 10-fold more abundant than the c-Myc molecules in HeLa cells. Studies have shown that sf9 insect cells, like vertebrate cells, are able to process post-translational protein modifications, including O-GlcNAc(26Faulkner P. Whitford M. J. Virol. 1992; : 3324-3329PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ku N.-O. Omary M.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A recent study on human cytomegalovirus tegument basic phosphoprotein indicated that the O-GlcNAc sites of the recombinant baculoviral protein faithfully correspond to those of the native virion protein(28Greis K.D. Gibson W. Hart G.W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8339-8349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). c-Myc was purified from 5 liters of infected sf9 cells, harvested at ~2 × 106 cells/ml. During the initial lysis procedure, 50 mM GlcNAc was added to the buffers to partially inhibit the endogenous hexosaminidase activity. Most of the overexpressed c-Myc protein appeared to be bound to DNA and could only be extracted by 5 M urea or SDS(19Papoulas O. Williams N.G. Kingston R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10470-10480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein samples from sequential steps of purification were subjected to SDS-PAGE for silver staining and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). Proteins co-electrophoresing with c-Myc comprised more than 95% of the total after purification by Mono Q chromatography. When O-GlcNAc in this purified c-Myc preparation was labeled with [3H]galactose by galactosyltransferase, c-Myc was the major radioactive signal(13Chou T.-Y. Dang C.V. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Purified c-Myc was first trypsinized to gain better accessibility to O-GlcNAc residues for subsequent galactosyltransferase labeling(20Roquemore E.P. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The O-GlcNAc-modified glycopeptides, labeled with [3H]galactose by galactosyltransferase, were separated by RP-HPLC at pH 7.0 on a C18 column in the first dimension. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, only one major radioactive peak was detected, which contained ~48 pmol of labeled glycopeptide. The fraction corresponding to the radioactive peak (fraction 65) was applied to a second dimension RP-HPLC at pH 2.0 and the radioactivity eluted as a single peak (Fig. 2b). When the fraction containing this radioactive peak was applied to a third dimension RP-HPLC at pH 4.0, a single radioactive peak was eluted (Fig. 2c). The yield of radiolabeled glycopeptide after these multiple HPLC analyses was ~12.5% due to the “sticky” nature of this glycopeptide. After the third round of HPLC, the UV absorbance profile suggested that this peptide was fairly homogeneous. Therefore, further fractionation (e.g. ion-exchange chromatography) was not performed (however, see below). An aliquot containing 5.5 pmol of [3H]galactose-labeled glycopeptide from the third dimension RP-HPLC was subjected to gas-phase sequencing. The relative abundance of amino acids recovered in each sequencing cycle surprisingly suggested the presence of three major co-purified peptides (Fig. 3): DTHKSEIAHRFK(DLGEEHFK) (~15 pmol), SFFAL(R) or SFFAL(R)DQIPEL(ENNEK) (~10 pmol), and FELLP(T)PPL(SPSR) (~5 pmol). The two less abundant peptides were from c-Myc tryptic fragments of amino acids 373-378, SFFALR (or 373-389, SFFALRDQIPELENNEK), in the first helix (and loop) region and amino acids 53-65, FELLPTPPLSPSR, in the transactivation domain. A protein data bank search (BLAST, National Institutes of Health) revealed the more abundant peptide, DTHKSEIAHRFKDLGEEHFK, was from tryptic fragments of bovine serum albumin. Fetal bovine serum (10%) added in the insect cell culture medium is likely the source of this contaminating peptide. Apparently, this serum-derived peptide either exactly co-migrates with the c-myc peptides or binds to them with high affinity during HPLC purification. The presence of this contaminant is surprising since we have typically found this iterative RP-HPLC method to provide more than adequate purification of glycopeptides for sequencing(20Roquemore E.P. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Greis K.D. Gibson W. Hart G.W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8339-8349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the three major peptides detected by the gas-phase sequencing contain serine or threonine at different positions, sequential manual Edman degradation, followed by scintillation counting to detect the released radiolabeled saccharide, provides an unambiguous assignment of the site of O-GlcNAc modification. The result of sequential manual Edman degradation (Fig. 4) indicates that the threonine residue in FELLPTPPLSPSR (threonine 58) is glycosylated. Only the peptide FELLPTPPLSPSR has a threonine or serine at the sixth amino acid, the cycle in which the radiolabel is released. The assignment of O-GlcNAc glycosylation to threonine 58 is also supported by two other observations. First, the major radioactive peak from the first, second, and third round of RP-HPLC eluted at 22.5, 26.8, and 26.0% acetonitrile, respectively, consistent with the predicted retention times for the peptide FELLPTPPLSPSR(41Meek J.L. Rossetti Z.L. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 211: 15-28Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Second, the gas-phase sequencing data showed the amount of the released phenylthiohydantoin-threonine was smaller than other internal residues of the peptide F(5.4)E(1.5)L(4.1)L(2.4)P(2.7)T(<0.5)P(1.1)P(0.5)L(4.3)S(<0.5)P(<0.5)S(<0.5)R (repetitive yields are in parentheses following each amino acid), suggesting that threonine 58 has been modified. This low recovery of threonine 58 also ruled out the possibility that the released radioactivity in the sixth sequencing cycle came from a small amount of contaminating peptide. The conclusion that threonine 58 is the site of O-GlcNAc was further confirmed by analyzing the peptides by MALDI-MS (Fig. 5). A peak with m/z 1867.3 was assigned to the mass of FELLPTPPLSPSR (1453.71) plus [3H]Galβ1-4GlcNAc (367.33) plus two sodium (2 × 22.99) (total = 1867.02). We also noted a peak with m/z 1493.9 corresponding to FELLPTPPLSPSR (1453.71) plus sodium (22.99) plus H2O (18.02) (total = 1494.72) and a peak with m/z 1696.5 corresponding to FELLPTPPLSPSR (1453.71) plus GlcNAc (203.18) plus sodium (22.99) plus H2O (18.02) (total = 1697.9). Since both glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of c-Myc are present in cells and the galactosyltransferase labeling is not completely efficient(20Roquemore E.P. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the co-existence of FELLPTPPLSPSR, FELLPTPPLSPSR with GlcNAc, and FELLPTPPLSPSR with [3H]galactosylated GlcNAc is expected. In addition, RP-HPLC generally does not resolve unmodified, O-GlcNAc-modified, or galactosylated O-GlcNAc-modified peptides(20Roquemore E.P. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently found that O-GlcNAc saccharides are rapidly and selectively lost during ionization in electrospray mass spectrometry. 2K. Greis, B. Hayes, and G. W. Hart, unpublished observations. Also found in the mass spectrometry were a peak with m/z 865.6 corresponding to SFFALR (739.88) plus phosphate (79.98) plus two sodium (2 × 22.99) (total = 865.84) and a peak with m/z 2717.7 corresponding to DTHKSEIAHRFKDLGEEHFK (2405.13) plus copper (63.55) plus hexose (162.14) plus three sodium (3 × 22.99) plus H2O (18.02) (total = 2717.54). The peptide DTHKSEIAHRFKDLGEEHFK contains a copper chelating site at its histidine residues. A non-enzymatic glycation at lysine 12 of the peptide DTHKSEIAHRFKDLGEEHFK has been reported(29Iberg N.

From the data of gas-phase sequencing, sequential Edman degradation, and mass spectrometry we conclude that threonine 58 is the major O-GlcNAc site of c-Myc. Threonine 58 is in the TAD of c-Myc within the region where we previously localized O-GlcNAc by more indirect methods(13Chou T.-Y. Dang C.V. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It has been shown that threonine 58 is a phosphorylation site in vivo(30Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5510-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and can be phosphorylated in vitro by glycogen synthase kinase 3(10Henriksson M. Bakardjiev A. Klein G. Luscher B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3199-3209PubMed Google Scholar). Threonine 58 is altered to a methionine in MC29 and HB1 v-Myc and to an alanine in OK10 and MH2 v-Myc(31Papas T.S. Lautenberger J.A. Nature. 1985; 318: 237Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These mutations of threonine 58 in v-Myc enhance the transforming activity of Myc protein(32Raffeld M. Yano T. Hoang A.T. Lewis B.C. Clark H.M. Otsuki T. Dang C.V. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 194: 265-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Frykberg L. Graf T. Vennstrom B. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 415-421PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, a v-Myc protein with a threonine at amino acid 58 has a reduced capability to induce growth in soft agar by non-transformed embryo fibroblasts(34Palmieri S. Kahn P. Graf T. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2385-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Symonds G. Hartshorn A. Kennewell A. O'Mara M.-A. Bruskin A. Bishop J.M. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 285-294PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of c-Myc and v-Myc by a variety of transformation assays also revealed that c-Myc has a reduced ability to induce tumor formation(33Frykberg L. Graf T. Vennstrom B. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 415-421PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that threonine 58 has a key role in transducing a negative growth signal of c-Myc through its post-translational modifications. This working hypothesis is supported by the observations that mutations of c-Myc at or near threonine 58 are frequently found in Burkitt or AIDS-related lymphomas, and threonine 58 is the most frequently mutated amino acid of c-Myc in these tumors(36Rabbitts T. Hamlyn P. Baer R. Nature. 1983; 306: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 37Yano T. Sander C.A. Clark H.M. Dolezal M.V. Jaffe E.S. Raffeld M.

Blood. 1994; 84: 883-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since mutations altering threonine 58 augment c-Myc transforming ability, we speculate that reciprocal phosphorylation/O-GlcNAc glycosylation modulate the activity of c-Myc. With the observation that c-Myc polypeptide levels remain relatively constant throughout the cell cycle(25Hann S.R. Thompson C.B. Eisenman R.N. Nature. 1985; 314: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), we also propose that these reciprocal post-translational modifications of threonine 58 differentially regulate c-Myc functions in different stages of the cell cycle.

Recent studies showed that many previously identified phosphorylated residues in PHF-tau also are phosphate acceptor sites in fetal and rapidly processed adult brain tau. However, Ser262 has been suggested to be uniquely phosphorylated in PHF-tau and a key regulator of the binding of tau to microtubules. For these reasons, we generated a monoclonal antibody (12E8) specific for phosphorylated Ser262 and showed that 12E8 binds to PHF-tau, rat and human fetal brain tau, as well as to rapidly processed adult rat and biopsy-derived human brain tau. Further, phosphorylation at Ser262 was developmentally regulated, and endogenous brain phosphatases rapidly dephosphorylated Ser262 in biopsy-derived brain tau isolates. Finally, the phosphorylation of Ser262 did not eliminate the binding of tau to microtubules. Thus, we speculate that the binding of tau to microtubules is regulated by phosphorylation at multiple sites and that the generation of PHF-tau in Alzheimer's disease results from the reduced efficiency of phosphatases leading to the incremental accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau.

Although none of the above protein kinases has been reported to phosphorylate Ser262, Ser262 has been reported to be phosphorylated by a novel 35/41-kDa kinase partially purified from brain(36Biernat J. Gustke N. Drewes G. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 153-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Since the latter study emphasized the critical importance of Ser262 in regulating the binding of tau to MTs and the pivotal role that Ser262 may play in the pathogenesis of PHF-tau in AD(36Biernat J. Gustke N. Drewes G. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 153-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), we explored this issue further using a novel monoclonal antibody (MAb) raised to a synthetic phosphopeptide spanning amino acid residues 257-270 in human tau with a phosphoserine at position 262. Using this novel MAb, we show here that Ser262 is phosphorylated in PHF-tau as well as in normal brain tau and that phosphorylation at Ser262 alone cannot account for the inability of PHF-tau to bind to MTs. A/J mice were purchased from Jackson Labs, and Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River. Synthetic phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides were made by BioServ Labs, and non-phosphorylated peptides were synthesized at Athena Neurosciences, Inc. Maleimidohexanoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide was obtained from Boehringer. SDS-molecular weight standards, GTP, dithiothreitol, MES, and 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid (NTCB) were from Sigma; the mouse myeloma cell line SP2/O-Ag14 was from the American Type Culture Center; sheep anti-mouse IgG was from Jackson Immunochemicals; 125I-labeled goat-anti-mouse IgG was from ICN, and 125I-labeled protein A-agarose was purchased from DuPont NEN. The immunogen was a synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to amino acid residues 257-270 in tau (according to the numbering of the longest human tau isoform)(10Goedert M.S. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar), with a phosphoserine at position Ser262, as well as with two additional Gly residues and a Cys residue added at the carboxyl terminus for ease of coupling. This peptide (KSKIGS(PO4)TENLKHQPGGC) was coupled to sheep anti-mouse IgG using maleimidohexanoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide, and 100 μg of the immunogen was emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into A/J mice. Additional boosting was done three times at biweekly intervals using 100 μg of immunogen emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Mice were tittered against the phosphorylated peptide by radioimmunoassay (RIA, see below), and the mouse with the highest antibody titer was injected intravenously and intraperitoneally 1 month after the last boost with 50 μg of immunogen in phosphate-buffered saline. 3 days later, the mouse was sacrificed, the spleen was removed, and spleen cells were fused with the myeloma cell line SP2/O-Ag14 by a modification of the method of Kohler and Milstein(37Kohler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12509) Google Scholar). Hybridoma-containing wells were screened by RIA for their ability to capture an 125I-labeled Ser262-phosphorylated synthetic peptide. This peptide was similar to the immunogen except that a Tyr was substituted for Gly-Gly-Cys. The hybridoma with the highest titer was subcloned, and a stable hybridoma line was obtained that secreted a MAb designated 12E8. This MAb was produced and purified from ascites for use here except as noted. The specificity of MAb 12E8 was determined by competitive RIA. Briefly, supernatants from late log phase 12E8 hybridoma cultures were harvested, and 50 μl of supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 37°C with unlabeled peptides (at dilutions of 25 nM to 18 μM) with or without selective phosphorylation at Ser262 and with a Tyr residue at the carboxyl terminus. 50 μl of 125I-labeled Ser262-phosphorylated synthetic peptide was added to each well and incubated for an additional 2 h at 37°C. The antigen-antibody complexes were immunoprecipitated using rabbit anti-mouse IgG bound to protein A-Sepharose. The antigen-antibody Sepharose complexes were washed four times and counted using a Wallac Microbeta following the manufacturer's instructions. Tau constructs containing 4 MT binding repeats (4R tau) were used to produce the Ala262, Ala356, and Ala262/Ala356 tau proteins by mutagenizing codons 262 and/or 356 from TCC to GCG as described(11Goedert M.

Purified PHF-tau from postmortem AD brains (at postmortem intervals of 6-14 h) and enriched autopsy-derived fetal brain tau (at postmortem intervals of 1-14 h) were prepared exactly as reported(13Bramblett G.T.

Rat brain tau was obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats of different ages as described for biopsy-derived human tau. In these studies, biopsy-derived brain samples were processed for the isolation of tau within 10-15 min of surgical removal, and fresh rat brains were processed similarly within less than 2 min of sacrifice. We also isolated MT binding competent (BC) and binding incompetent (BI) tau from biopsy brain samples using previously published protocols(22Mawal-Dewan M. Henley J. Van de Voorde A. Trojanowski J.Q.

Briefly, the high speed tissue extracts were supplemented with GTP and glycerol and incubated at 37°C to induce MT assembly.

The NTCB cleavage of PHF-tau from AD brains, biopsy-derived adult human tau, and autopsy-derived fetal human tau was carried out essentially as described(46Girault J.-A. Hemmings Jr., H.C.

Briefly, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated enriched tau preparations or lyophilized samples of tau containing 10-25 μg of protein were resuspended in 25 μl of 40 mM EDTA, 20 mM dithiothreitol and incubated in a boiling water bath for 2 min. Guanidine HCl and Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 were added to each tube to give a final concentration of 6.4 and 0.1 M, respectively, in a final volume of 250 μl. Samples were incubated for 12 h at 37°C, at which time 50 μl of 60 mM NTCB in 6.4 M guanidine HCl and 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was added to each tube, and the incubation continued for another 48 h. The protein was precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 6% followed by centrifugation. The protein pellet was resuspended in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 4 volumes of methanol:chloroform:water (4:1:3) were added. The samples were then spun, and the top layer was removed. The protein at the interface was precipitated by adding cold methanol, incubated on ice for 1 h, and centrifuged. The final pellet was air-dried, resuspended in sample buffer, and electrophoresed as described above. Small pieces of biopsy (control) or autopsy (AD cases)-derived brain were immersion-fixed in isotonic 70% ethanol (pH 7.4) at 4°C for 18-24 h. The biopsy samples were normal residual fragments removed with epileptic foci from patients with intractable seizures(23Matsuo E.S. Shin R-W. Billingsley M.L. Van deVoorde A. O'Conner M.

Fixed tissues were infiltrated and embedded in paraffin, and 6-μm-thick sections were cut from paraffin blocks of the brain samples(23Matsuo E.S. Shin R-W. Billingsley M.L. Van deVoorde A.

The study of these tissues was approved by the Committee on Studies of Human Subjects at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. The specificity of the 12E8 MAb was determined initially by RIA, which showed that this MAb did not bind to the non-phosphorylated synthetic peptide, since binding of 125I-labeled peptide phosphorylated at Ser262 was not appreciably competed out by the non-phosphorylated peptide (Fig. 1). Further, 12E8 also was able to bind strongly to the non-radiolabeled Ser262-phosphorylated peptide, since the 125I-labeled phosphorylated synthetic peptide binding was effectively competed for by the unlabeled Ser262-phosphorylated peptide (Fig. 1). These results suggest that 12E8 recognized phosphorylated but not non-phosphorylated Ser262. Since the sequence containing Ser262 (KIGSTEN) within the first MT binding repeat is similar to that in the fourth MT binding repeat (KIGSLDN), experiments were conducted to determine whether 12E8 also recognizes phosphorylated Ser356 in this motif or any other residues in tau phosphorylated by rat brain extracts. Purified wild type Ser262/Ser356 4R tau, as well as several tau mutants (i.e. Ala262 4R tau, Ala356 4R tau, and Ala262/Ala356 4R tau) were expressed in E. coli and then probed with antibodies 134 and 12E8 (Fig. 2). As expected, none of the non-phosphorylated, recombinant wild type or mutant 4R tau proteins were labeled by 12E8 (Fig. 2B, lanes1, 3, 5, and 7). By contrast, wild type 4R tau, Ala262 4R tau, and Ala356 4R tau, but not Ala262/Ala356 4R tau, were recognized by 12E8 following in vitro phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, lanes2, 4, 6, and 8). This suggests that 12E8 binds only to tau proteins that are phosphorylated at Ser262 and/or Ser356. Of the two sites, 12E8 recognized Ser262 better than Ser356. Further, the phosphorylation of other residues in tau was not required for the recognition of tau by 12E8 since this MAb did not recognize the Ala262/Ala356 double 4R tau mutant after phosphorylation. The latter treatment also revealed that the in vitro phosphorylation of Ser262 and/or Ser356 did not alter the electrophoretic mobility of these tau proteins, since wild type 4R tau and the 4R tau mutants migrated similarly before and after in vitro phosphorylation (Fig. 2A).Figure 2:Epitope mapping of 12E8. Wild type (WT) recombinant tau expressed from cDNA clone htau24 and mutated at Ser262 (Ala262/Ser356), Ser356 (Ser262/Ala356) or Ser262 and Ser356 (Ala262/Ala356) were immunoblotted with antiserum 134 (panelA) or MAb 12E8 (panelB) following incubation without (-) or with (+) a rat brain extract, resulting in the phosphorylation of tau. Antiserum 134 is not phosphorylation-dependent.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since previous studies demonstrated that Ser262 is partially phosphorylated in PHF-tau, we probed PHF-tau from postmortem AD brains as well as tau from autopsy-derived adult and fetal brains using Western blots and a number of different anti-tau antibodies in addition to 12E8 (Fig. 3). Fig. 3A demonstrates the profile of tau proteins present in these preparations as monitored with phosphate-independent antibodies. Fig. 3C shows that 12E8 binds to PHF-tau like other phosphorylation-dependent anti-tau antibodies such as PHF1 (Fig. 3B) and AT8 (Fig. 3D). Next, we probed Western blots of tau-rich isolates obtained from human biopsies processed immediately after surgical removal and from autopsy-derived adult and fetal human brains (Fig. 3C), and we showed that 12E8 recognized both biopsy-derived normal human adult tau and autopsy-derived normal fetal brain tau but not to autopsy-derived adult tau. This suggests that Ser262 and/or Ser356 are normal in vivo sites of phosphorylation in tau. 12E8 also binds to all three major isoforms of biopsy-derived tau much like the phosphorylation-independent antibodies T14/T46 and the phosphorylation-dependent MAb PHF1 (compare Fig. 3C with 3A and 3B). Quantitative assessment (Fig. 3, E-H) of the extent of phosphorylation of biopsy-derived brain tau, autopsy-derived adult and fetal brain tau, as well as of PHF-tau suggests that compared to PHF-tau only a fraction of the biopsy-derived adult tau (about 15-20%) and autopsy-derived fetal tau (about 28%) is phosphorylated at Ser262 and/or Ser356. Previous mass spectrometry studies suggested that Ser262 was variably phosphorylated in PHF-tau but not in fetal or adult tau (18Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Watanabe A. Hasegawa M. Suzuki M. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Titani K. Arai T. Kosik K.S. Ihara Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ser262 alone, Ser356 alone, or Ser262 and Ser356 together are in vivo sites of phosphorylation, autopsy-derived fetal tau, biopsy-derived adult tau, and autopsy-derived PHF-tau were cleaved with NTCB. Since NTCB cleaves selectively at Cys residues(46Girault J.-A. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Williams K.R. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21748-21759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this provides a strategy for distinguishing between the binding of 12E8 to Ser262versus Ser356. Fetal tau contains a single Cys within the third MT binding repeat or repeat 3, whereas adult tau proteins contain 2 Cys residues in MT binding repeats 2 and 3, respectively(12Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Cairns N.J. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 159-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Thus, cleavage of tau preparations with NTCB will result in amino-terminal fragments containing Ser262 (located within MT binding repeat 1) and carboxyl-terminal fragments containing Ser356 (located within MT binding repeat 4). We used T14 (an MAb that binds to a phosphorylation-independent epitope located within amino acid residues 141-178 of tau) to identify amino-terminal fragments of tau and T46 (a MAb that binds to a phosphorylation-independent epitope located between amino acid residues 404-441) to identify carboxyl-terminal fragments of tau. MAb 12E8 only detected tau fragments that were derived from the amino but not from the carboxyl terminus of tau (Fig. 4). Thus, despite some heterogeneity in the tau cleavage products generated by NTCB, we showed that Ser262 but not Ser356 is an endogenous phosphorylation site in PHF-tau, fetal tau, and biopsy-derived adult tau. To determine the consequence of the phosphorylation of Ser262 on the binding affinity of tau to endogenous MTs, we performed MT binding assays on high speed homogenates of biopsy-brain samples (Fig. 5). Fig. 5C shows that MT BI and BC biopsy-derived adult tau phosphorylated at Ser262 were recovered from supernatant and pellet fractions. Under the conditions described here, approximately 75% of total tau was recovered in the MT pellet (Fig. 5A). Since 55% of the BC tau proteins were 12E8 positive, the phosphorylation of Ser262 does not appear to play an essential role in eliminating the binding of tau to MTs (Fig. 5C). Similarly, phosphorylation at Ser396/Ser404 or Ser202/Thr205 did not eliminate binding of tau to MTs (Fig. 5, B and D, respectively). To further characterize the phosphorylation of Ser262, rat brain tau obtained at different developmental stages was probed with MAb 12E8 (Fig. 6). The brain samples came from rats at embryonic day 18 (E18), postnatal days 7, 11, 19, and 25 (i.e. P7-25), and from 3- and 20-month-old rats. These studies showed that Ser262 was heavily phosphorylated in “fetal” tau at E18 and that the extent of phosphorylation progressively declined postnatally as the rodent brain matured (Fig. 6, B and D). These observations suggest that during embryogenesis and in the early postnatal period, tau is heavily phosphorylated at Ser262, but by P11 and beyond, progressively fewer phosphate residues remain at this site. Indeed, only about 10% of tau from 20-month-old rat brain was phosphorylated at Ser262. Since many phosphorylation sites in adult tau are rapidly dephosphorylated by endogenous brain phosphatases during postmortem or postsurgical delays(23Matsuo E.S. Shin R-W. Billingsley M.L. Van deVoorde A. O'Conner M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Neuron. 1994; 13: 989-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), we simulated such conditions by allowing freshly excised human brain biopsy samples to remain at room temperature for varying lengths of time as described(23Matsuo E.S. Shin R-W. Billingsley M.L. Van deVoorde A. O'Conner M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Neuron. 1994; 13: 989-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The tau proteins isolated from these samples were then analyzed by immunoblotting using many of the anti-tau antibodies described above (Fig. 7). Fig. 7A shows the profile of tau proteins in these samples labeled with the T14/46 mixture of MAbs. Consistent with previous studies(23Matsuo E.S. Shin R-W. Billingsley M.L. Van deVoorde A. O'Conner M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Neuron. 1994; 13: 989-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), Fig. 7, C and G, shows that biopsy-derived adult human brain tau was rapidly dephosphorylated at Ser262 at room temperature. In fact, after only 1 h of simulated postsurgical delay, the extent of phosphorylation of tau at Ser262 was reduced by over 90% (Fig. 7G). Notably, Ser262 was much more rapidly dephosphorylated than Ser396/Ser404 or Ser202/Thr205. After only a 5-min postsurgical delay, the intensity of the immunobands detected by 12E8 was reduced to a far greater extent (i.e. by about 70%) than that produced by other phosphate-dependent MAbs (i.e. compare Fig. 7B, 7D, 7F, and 7H with 7C and 7G). The phosphorylation of biopsy-derived tau and PHF-tau at Ser262 was also demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 8). Fig. 8A shows intense 12E8 immunoreactivity in processes throughout the cortical neuropil of a biopsy sample while neuronal perikarya stand out as 12E8 negative oval or pyramidal profiles. In sections from postmortem AD neocortex (Fig. 8B), 12E8 intensely labeled the PHF-tau accumulations in perikaryal neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, and dystrophic neurites, much like previously described phosphorylation-dependent anti-tau antibodies (e.g. see results obtained with PHF1 in Fig. 8C). We have used a novel MAb (12E8) to assess the role of phosphorylated Ser262 in the pathogenesis of PHF-tau. The specificity of 12E8 for tau phosphorylated at Ser262 was demonstrated by RIA and Western blot analyses. Since the sequences surrounding Ser262 and Ser356 are similar, we performed additional studies using recombinant tau proteins harboring Ser to Ala mutations at positions 262 and/or 356, which showed that 12E8 recognizes recombinant tau when phosphorylated at Ser262, Ser356, or at both positions. Since 12E8 recognized PHF-tau, fetal brain tau, and biopsy-derived adult brain tau, we probed NTCB cleavage products of tau and demonstrate that only Ser262 is phosphorylated in tau from normal and AD brain. The recognition of PHF-tau on immunoblots and the intense staining of neurofibrillary lesions in AD brain by immunohistochemistry with 12E8 confirm that Ser262 is phosphorylated in PHF-tau(18Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, contrary to previous findings(18Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we also found that Ser262 is a site of phosphorylation in normal fetal and adult human and rodent tau. The demonstration here that Ser262 is rapidly dephosphorylated by brain phosphatases appears to account for the discrepancy between the present and previous studies(18Hasegawa M.

Our results indicate that of the phosphorylation sites in brain tau studied to date, Ser262 is the most labile since 70% of the phosphate was lost within 5 min of postsurgical delay, compared with 10% for Ser396/Ser404 and 50% for Ser202/Thr205. Further, we also show that the phosphorylation of Ser262 in normal brain tau is developmentally regulated and that only a fraction of biopsy-derived tau is phosphorylated at Ser262 compared with PHF-tau. Similar results also have been obtained with anti-tau antibodies AT8, AT180, AT270, T3P, and PHF1, which recognize specific Ser/Thr-Pro sites in tau when phosphorylated(13Bramblett G.T. Goedert M.

Since 12E8 is the first antibody to a phosphorylation site in tau that is not of the Ser/Thr-Pro type, the present data indicate that proline-directed kinases do not fully account for the normal or the abnormal phosphorylation of tau. Although a novel 35/41-kDa protein kinase partially purified from brain phosphorylates tau at Ser262in vitro, both cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylate recombinant tau at this site in vitro. 2J. M. Litersky, G. V. W. Johnson, R. Jakes, M. Goedert, M. Lee, and P. Seubert, submitted for publication. Thus, multiple protein kinases may phosphorylate tau at this site in normal and AD brains. Further, reduced phosphatase activity may play an important role in PHF-tau formation(22Mawal-Dewan M. Henley J. Van de Voorde A. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol.

Although the protein phosphatases that act on the Ser262 site are unknown, preliminary results indicate that protein phosphatase 2A dephosphorylate tau at Ser262. 3V. M.-Y. Lee and M. Mawal-Dewan, unpublished results. The findings described here serve to further clarify the pathogenesis of PHF-tau by demonstrating that phosphorylation of Ser262 is not sufficient to eliminate the binding of tau to MTs. Indeed, they suggest that the simultaneous phosphorylation of multiple sites may be required for the disruption of the interactions between tau and MTs. Thus, the challenge for the future will be to identify the phosphorylation sites that are most critical for regulating the binding of tau to MTs, as well as the protein kinases and protein phosphatases that modulate the state of phosphorylation of tau in both normal and AD brain.

Since PGD2 is the major prostanoid released from human mast cells upon immunological challenge(5Lewis R.A. Soter N.A. Diamond P.T. Austen F. Oates J.A. Roberts II, L.J. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 1627-1631PubMed Google Scholar), it is also considered to be an important mediator in allergic disorders such as allergic rhinitis(6Johnston S.L. Smith S. Harrison J. Ritter W. Howarth P.H. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1993; 91: 903-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been tested as a potential intraocular pressure lowering agent for treatment of glaucoma(7Nakajima M. Goh Y. Azuma I. Hayaishi O. Graefe's Arch. Clin. Exp.

Other roles for PGD2, such as effects on platelet aggregation (1 and references within), systemic vasodilation, pulmonary constriction, and bronchoconstriction (1 and references within) appear, however, to be restricted to specific species. In addition, several of the physiological effects assigned to PGD2, including bronchoconstriction, may be attributable to the cross-reactivity of PGD2 with the prostaglandin F2ɑ and/or thromboxane A2 receptors(9Hamid-Bloomfield S.

The physiological and pathophysiological actions of PGD2 are mediated through interaction with the prostanoid DP receptor. 2Prostanoid receptors are designated following the recommendation of the IUPHAR Commission on Receptor Nomenclature and Classification (52). Specific binding sites for the DP receptor have been studied using membranes from human platelets (10Thierauch K.-H. Stürzebecher C.-St. Schillinger E. Rehwinkel H. Radüchel B. Skuballa W.

(32) as the EP2 subtype has now been reclassified as the EP4 subtype since it has negligible affinity (K = 23 μM) for the EP2-selective agonist butaprost. In contrast, the PGE2 receptor described by Regan et al. (28) displays moderate affinity (K = 1.4 μM) for butaprost and has therefore been designated as the EP2 subtype. ) receptor. Here we report the cloning of the human prostaglandin D2 (DP) receptor, and the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences are described. The radioligand binding and functional characteristics of the cloned and expressed hDP receptor have been addressed, in addition to its tissue distribution. In order to clone the hDP prostanoid receptor, a mouse DP receptor DNA probe was first generated using the polymerase chain reaction as described below. Two oligonucleotides based on the mouse DP receptor amino acid sequence (34Hirata M. Kakizuka A. Aizawa M. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11192-11196Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) were designed and synthesized (Research Genetics, Cambridge, MA). The 5′-sense 128-fold degenerate oligonucleotide (5′-ATG AA(T,C) GA(G,A) (T,A)(G,C)I TA(T,C) (A,C)GI TG(T,C) CA-3′) was based on the first eight amino acids (MNESYRCQ), and the 3′-antisense 16-fold degenerate oligonucleotide (5′-AA (G,A)CA CCA IGT ICC IGG (G,A)CA (G,A)TA (T,C)TG-3′) was based on nine amino acids (QYCPGTWCF) which occur in the second extracellular loop of the mouse DP receptor. The polymerase chain reaction protocol for the amplification, performed on a DNA thermal cycler 480 (Perkin Elmer, Montreal, Canada) using Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim, Laval, Quebec) and 1.5 μg of mouse genomic DNA (Clontech) as template, was as follows: denaturation at 95°C for 60 s, annealing at 52°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 40 s, for 35 cycles. The 549-bp amplified product was subsequently isolated from a low-melt agarose gel, random prime labeled (T7 Quick Prime Kit, Pharmacia, Baie D'urfe, Quebec) with [32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN, Mississauga, Ontario), and added to a 50% formamide hybridization buffer to screen 1.2 × 106 plaques from a λEMBL3 T7/SP6 Sau3AI human genomic library (Clontech). Two positive phage clones, λhDPgc.1 and λhDPgc.2, were plaque-purified, and DNA was prepared by the plate lysate method(35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction mapping of λhDPgc.1 and λhDPgc.2 DNA was performed using XhoI, SacI, SfiI, EcoRI, XbaI, BamHI, HindIII, and Asp718I. Restriction digest analysis showed that both clones were identical. Southern blot analysis of the digested DNA was performed with either the 32P-labeled mouse DP genomic DNA fragment or a 29-mer 4-fold degenerate oligonucleotide, hDP-VII(+) (5′-ATIGTIGA(T,C)CCITGGATITT(T,C)ATIATITT-3′), based upon 10 amino acids from transmembrane domain (TMD) VII (IVDPWIFIIF) from the mouse DP receptor(34Hirata M. Kakizuka A. Aizawa M. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11192-11196Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Results from the Southern analysis identified a 3-kb EcoRI fragment which hybridized with the 549-bp mouse DP DNA probe but not the oligonucleotide probe and, in addition, a 4.5-kb XhoI/EcoRI fragment originating from the 3′-end of the genomic insert which hybridized with the hDP-VII(+) oligonucleotide probe but not the mouse DP DNA probe. These fragments were isolated and subcloned into Bluescript pKS vectors (Stratagene) for sequence analysis using an ABI 373 Stretch automated sequencer. The first 1.5 kb of the 3-kb EcoRI fragment was sequenced on both strands using KS and SK primers or primers generated from the determined sequences. This sequence was found to contain the 5′ end of the coding region up to and including an exon/intron splice site located near the end of TMD VI as well as part of the intron. The 3′ end of the 4.5-kb XhoI/EcoRI fragment was sequenced as above and found to contain the continuation of the coding region from the end of TMD VI through to the end of TMD VII, which was also the end of the genomic clone. To obtain the missing 3′-coding region of the hDP receptor, 3′-RACE-PCR was performed on human small intestine, lung, thymus, kidney, and uterus cDNA libraries (Clontech). Anchored primers, complementary to λgt10 or λgt11 DNA sequences at their multiple cloning site junctions, and sense primers, AP-1 (5′-CCTGGCCATGGCACTGGAGTGCTGG-3′) (end of TMD III), AP-2 (5′-GCTGTGCAACCTCGGCGCCATGCGC-3′] (end of TMD V), and AP-3 (5′-CTCCGAGCCTTGCGATTTCTATCTG-3′) (beginning of TMD VII), based on the sequence obtained from the hDP receptor genomic clone were either purchased from Clontech or synthesized as above. The polymerase chain reaction protocol for all rounds of amplification was as follows: denaturation at 95°C for 60 s, annealing at 55°C for 60 s, and extension at 72°C for 60 s, for 35 cycles. For the first reaction, 2 μl (~107 plaque-forming units/μl) of the cDNA library was amplified using a λgt primer and AP-1. For the second amplification, 1/50 (2 μl) of the first polymerase chain reaction was reamplified with the same λgt primer and either AP-2 or AP-3. Amplified products were then analyzed by Southern blotting according to standard protocols (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide hDP-VII(+). Hybridizing polymerase chain reaction fragments were subsequently cloned into Bluescript vector pKS and sequenced as above. An amplified fragment (510 bp) from the small intestine cDNA library was found to extend an additional 157 bp (including an in-frame putative stop codon) as compared with the sequence at the 3′ end of the hDP genomic clone. Shorter amplified fragments of similar size were also obtained from the lung and uterus cDNA libraries. The lung fragment contained only 53 bp of additional sequence information and did not extend to the putative stop codon. The following strategy was used in order to construct a cDNA containing the full-length coding region for hDP: the 5′ end from the 3-kb EcoRI genomic fragment in pKS was digested with SmaI and PstI releasing a 0.75-kb fragment which encoded amino acid residues 1 to 232 of the hDP receptor. The 0.75-kb fragment was then ligated into the pKS construct, previously digested with SmaI and PstI, which contained the small intestine 3′-RACE-PCR fragment encoding amino acid residues 233 to 359. This construct was designated pKS-hDP. Digestion of pKS-hDP with NotI and XhoI released the hDP 1.2-kb cDNA which was subcloned into the same restriction sites of both the pcDNA3 and pCEP4 mammalian expression vectors (Invitrogen). The correct orientation was verified by BglII digestion. These vectors, termed pcDNA3-hDP and pCEP4-hDP, were subsequently used in transfection experiments for receptor binding and signal transduction assays, respectively. Poly(A+) RNA samples (3 μg) from 19 different human tissues (Clontech) were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.22 M formaldehyde and were then transferred to a nylon membrane (Nytran+, Schleicher and Schuell). The nylon membrane was hybridized at 42°C overnight in 50% formamide, 4 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 100 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA containing 1 × 106 cpm/ml of a 32P-random-prime-labeled 0.9-kb SmaI hDP fragment originating from the 3-kb EcoRI genomic fragment. The nylon membrane was washed with 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 55°C and then exposed at −80°C for 14 days with two intensifying screens. The pcDNA3-hDP vector was transfected into COS-M6 cells by cationic liposome-mediated transfer using LipofectAMINETM reagent (36Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4388) Google Scholar) (Life Technologies, Inc./BRL, Burlington, Ontario). The cells were maintained in culture for 48 h, harvested, and subjected to lysis by nitrogen cavitation(37Frey E.A. Nicholson D.W. Metters K.M. Eur. J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 244: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and membranes were prepared by differential centrifugation (1000 × g for 10 min, then 100,000 × g for 30 min). [3H]PGD2 binding assays were performed in 10 mM BES/KOH (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MnCl2, 0.8 nM [3H]PGD2 (115 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN), and 60 μg of protein from the 100,000 × g membrane fraction. Incubations were conducted for 60 min at 30°C prior to separation of the bound and free radioligand by rapid filtration through GF/B filters presoaked in 10 mM BES/KOH (pH 7.0) containing 0.01% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Filters were washed with 16 ml of soaking buffer, and the residual [3H]PGD2 bound to the filter was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Specific binding was defined as the difference between total binding and nonspecific binding which was determined in the presence of 1 μM PGD2. Stable expression of the hDP receptor was achieved by transfection of the pCEP4-hDP plasmid into HEK 293(EBNA) cells (maintained under selection with GENETICIN&#174; (G418) (Life Technologies, Inc.)), using LipofectAMINE&#174; reagent as described above. Cells were maintained in culture for 48 h post-transfection and then grown in the presence of 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem) for 3-4 weeks to select for resistant cells expressing the hDP receptor. These cells were subsequently used for signal transduction assays. hDP-HEK 293(EBNA) cells were maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 20 units/ml penicillin G, 20 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 250 μg/ml G418, and 200 μg/ml hygromycin B). The medium was replaced 16-24 h prior to harvesting the cells (at approximately 80% confluence). The cells were harvested by incubation in enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Life Technologies, Inc./BRL, Burlington, Ontario), washed with HEPES-buffered Krebs-Ringer solution (1.25 mM MgSO4, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM KCl, 124 mM NaCl, 8 mM glucose, 1.25 mM KH2PO4, and 25 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4)) and then resuspended in the same buffer. The cAMP assay was performed in a final volume of 0.2 ml of HEPES-buffer Krebs-Ringer solution containing a 100 μM concentration of the phosphodiesterase type IV inhibitor RO-20-1724 (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) to prevent hydrolysis of cAMP. RO-20-1724 and the compounds under evaluation were added to the incubation mixture in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) or ethanol to a final vehicle concentration, 0.3% (v/v), which was kept constant in all samples. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1.5 × 105 cells per incubation. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 15 min, and the reaction was then terminated by immersing the samples in boiling water for 3 min. Cell viability was always ≥96% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Measurement of cAMP was performed by radioimmunoassay using 125I-cAMP (Amersham, Oakville, Ontario). Intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) measurements were performed using the hDP-HEK 293(EBNA) stable cell line. The cells were harvested with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer, recovered by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 22°C, and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium growth medium without G418 or hygromycin B. The cells were incubated at 37°C, 6% CO2 for 45 min with 2 μM fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes). Unincorporated fura-2/AM was removed by three washes in Hanks' buffered saline solution (1.3 mM CaCl2, 5 mM KCl, 0.3 mM KH2PO4, 0.9 mM MgCl2, 138 mM NaCl, 4 mM NaHCO3, 0.3 mM Na2HPO4, 5.6 mM glucose) followed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 22°C. The cells were then resuspended at a final concentration of 106 cells/ml in Hanks' buffered saline solution. [Ca2+]i was measured following an agonist challenge of 2 × 106 fura-2/AM loaded cells using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 spectrophotometer essentially as described previously(38Chan C. Ecclestone P. Nicholson D.W. Metters K.M. Pon D.J. Rodger I.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 269: 891-896PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were viable at the end of each experiment, as monitored by the large increase in [Ca2+]i observed upon the addition of a 1 μM concentration of the calcium ionophore ionomycin (Sigma) followed by quenching of the [Ca2+]i response with 1 mM EDTA. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) measurements were performed using the hDP-HEK 293(EBNA) and hEP1-HEK 293(EBNA) stable cell lines and control HEK 293(EBNA) cells. The cells were harvested by incubation in enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer, washed with Hanks' buffered saline solution, and then resuspended in the same buffer. The Ins(1,4,5)P3 assay was performed in a final volume of 0.4 ml of Hanks' buffered saline solution containing 10 mM LiCl. The compounds under evaluation were added to the incubation mixture in Me2SO4 to a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v), which was kept constant in all samples. The reaction was started with the addition of 5 × 105 cells per incubation. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 10 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 20% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. Ins(1,4,5)P3 was extracted and measured by [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 radioreceptor assay (DuPont NEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions except that the bound and free radioligand was separated by rapid filtration through GF/C filters presoaked in 10 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 8.0). Filters were washed with 4 ml of 10 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 8.0), and the residual [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 bound to the filter was determined by liquid scintillation counting. In order to clone the hDP receptor, a mouse DP receptor fragment was first amplified from mouse genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction as described under “Materials and Methods.” This mouse DP DNA probe was subsequently used to screen a human genomic library, and a hDP genomic clone was identified. The clone was, however, missing coding information from the carboxyl-terminal end of the receptor. The additional coding sequence was derived by 3′-RACE-PCR of a human small intestine cDNA library which made it possible to construct the entire coding region for the hDP receptor from the hDP gene and the 3′-RACE-PCR fragment (Fig. 1A). The hDP genomic clone was found to contain an intron with consensus donor and acceptor splice site sequences (39Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar) near the end of TMD VI (Fig. 1B). This position is identical with that found in the mouse DP gene (Hirada) and homologous in position to that of the hTP receptor gene (40Nüsing R.M. Hirata M. Kakizuka A. Eki T. Ozawa K. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25253-25259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as other members of the human prostanoid receptor gene family. 4Y. Boie and M. Abramovitz, unpublished observations. This suggests that the prostanoid receptor family arose from a single ancestral gene. The hDP cDNA contains a 1,080-bp open reading frame coding for a 359-amino-acid protein (Fig. 1B) with a calculated molecular mass of 40,276. The ATG assigned as the initiator codon matches reasonably well to the Kozak consensus sequence (4/5 nucleotides) for translation initiation(41Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2383) Google Scholar). The genomic clone also contains an in-frame TAG stop codon 171 bp upstream of the predicted start codon (Fig. 1B). The hDP protein contains three potential N-glycosylation sites, Asn-10, Asn-90, and Asn-297, in the NH2 terminus and the first and third extracellular loops, respectively. There are also two potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, Ser-50 and Thr-145, located in the putative first and second cytoplasmic loops, respectively. In addition, there are six more potential phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl-terminal tail, comprised of five serine residues and one threonine residue which may be important in receptor desensitization(42Hausdorf W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis (43Kyte J. Dolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) of the deduced amino acid sequence of the hDP receptor confirmed the presence of the seven putative TMDs which are characteristic of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)(44Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The hDP receptor also shares limited, but significant, amino acid identity with members of the rhodopsin-like family within the GPCR superfamily(44Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). [3H]PGD2 binding assays were performed using membranes prepared from transient transfection of COS-M6 cells with pcDNA3-hDP. Preliminary receptor binding assays, performed to establish assay conditions, demonstrated that [3H]PGD2 specific binding was optimal at pH 7.0 and was maximally stimulated in the presence of 10 mM Mn2+. In addition, Scatchard analysis showed that [3H]PGD2 specific binding to the hDP receptor was of high affinity and conformed to a one-site model (Accufit Two-Site saturation software, Beckman Instruments) with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 1.5 nM (Fig. 2A). [3H]PGD2 specific binding was saturable, with a maximum number of specific binding sites (Bmax) of approximately 1.2 pmol/mg of membrane protein. Scatchard analysis was also performed in the presence of the slowly hydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS (100 μM) (Fig. 2A). In this case, the affinity of [3H]PGD2 for hDP was reduced approximately 20-fold (KD = 28 nM) demonstrating that dissociation of the associated G-proteins from the hDP receptor converts"
https://openalex.org/W1966714249,"We investigated the mechanisms by which H2O2 increases intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1; CD54) expression in endothelial cells. The H2O2-induced increase in ICAM-1 mRNA was inhibited by actinomycin D, by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, and by 3-aminobenzamide (which blocks oxidant-induced AP-1 activity), but not by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (which blocks oxidant-induced NF-κB activity). Nuclear run-on and transient transfections of ICAM-1 promoter constructs indicated that H2O2 stimulated ICAM-1 gene transcription by activation of a distinct region of the ICAM-1 promoter. The H2O2-responsive element was localized to sequences between −981 and −769 (relative to the start codon). Located within this region are two 16-base pair repeats, each containing binding sites for the transcription factors AP-1 and Ets. A similar composite AP-1/Ets element isolated from the macrophage scavenger receptor gene conferred H2O2 responsiveness to a minimal promoter. Mutation of the 16-base pair repeats within the ICAM-1 promoter prevented H2O2-induced DNA binding activity, and their deletion abrogated the H2O2-induced transcriptional activity. In contrast, TNFα induced ICAM-1 transcription via activation of promoter sequences between −393 and −176, a region with C/EBP and NF-κB binding sites. The results indicate that H2O2 activates ICAM-1 transcription through AP-1/Ets elements within the ICAM-1 promoter, which are distinct from NF-κB-mediated ICAM-1 expression induced by TNFα.

Williams T.J. Warren J.B. The Endothelium: An Introduction to Current Research. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 171-186Google Scholar). PMN adhesion to the endothelium occurs during reperfusion of tissues when reactive oxygen intermediates such as H2O2 are generated (13Hernandez L.A. Grisham M.B. Twohig B. Arfors K.E. Harlan J.M. Granger D.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: H699-H703PubMed Google Scholar). The adhesion event is mediated by molecules present or expressed on the surface of endothelial cells and PMN (21Lo S.K. Van Seventer G.A. Levin S.M. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1989; 169: 1779-1793Google Scholar). Endothelial cells express intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1; CD54), a counter-receptor for CD11/CD18 integrin (10Dustin M.L. Rothlein R. Bahn A.K. Dinarello C.A. Springer T.A. J.

Invest. 1989; 83: 2008-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Studies using monoclonal antibodies show that increased cell surface ICAM-1 expression is required for migration of PMN to sites of inflammation and PMN-mediated endothelial injury associated with reperfusion (16Kukielka G.L.

Recent studies show that the reactive oxidant, H2O2, also promotes ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells and ICAM-1-dependent adhesion of PMN (22Lo S.K. Janakidevi K. Lai L. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L406-L412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; 5Bradely J.R. Johnson D.R. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1598-1607PubMed Google Scholar; 36Sellak H. Franzini E. Hakim J. Pasquier C. Blood. 1994; 83: 2669-2677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 was recently reported to also increase ICAM-1 expression on keratinocytes (15Ikeda M. Schroeder K.K. Mosher L.B. Woods C.W. Akeson A.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), we found that oxidant-induced ICAM-1 expression was associated with increased ICAM-1 mRNA levels occurring 1 h after H2O2 exposure (22Lo S.K. Janakidevi K. Lai L. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L406-L412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 activates transcription factors, AP-1 and NF-κB, in a mouse osteoblastic cell line (30Nose K. Shibanuma M. Kikuchi K. Kageyama H. Sakiyama S. Kuroke T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and in HeLa and Jurkat cells (25Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). The ICAM-1 gene contains a number of AP-1-like and NF-κB-like binding sites within its promoter region (41Voraberger G. Schafer R. Stratowa C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2777-2786PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the activation of these transcription factors by H2O2 may be a mechanism of endothelial ICAM-1 gene expression. In this study, we examined the basis of H2O2-induced ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells. We showed that H2O2 activated ICAM-1 gene transcription via a 212-base pair (bp) promoter region between 981 and 769 bp upstream of the coding sequences. This region contained two 16-bp repeats which are binding sites for the transcription factors AP-1 and Ets. AP-1/Ets composite elements were shown to be sufficient to mediate H2O2-induced transcription. Although the AP-1/Ets elements also responded to TNFα, the TNFα-induced ICAM-1 expression was mediated by promoter sequences between 393 and 176 bp upstream of the gene, containing binding sites for C/EBP and NF-κB. Therefore, H2O2 and TNFα activate ICAM-1 gene transcription in endothelial cells through distinct cis-regulatory elements within the ICAM-1 promoter. The results identify a novel oxidant response element and indicate that mediator-specific regulation of ICAM-1 expression involves the interaction of multiple factors with the ICAM-1 promoter. Diethylpyrocarbonate, DMEM, heparin, HEPES, 3.0% H2O2, MOPS, PMSF, spermidine, spermine, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), and N-acetylcysteine (N-Cys(Ac)) were purchased from Sigma. We purchased 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) from Pfaltz and Bauer (Stamford, CT). Guanidine thiocyanate, restriction enzymes, random primer labeling kit, QuikHybTM hybridization mix, and Duralose-UVTM nitrocellulose membranes were purchased from Stratagene. Human ICAM-1 cDNA was provided by Dr. T. Springer, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. Plasmid containing the cDNA for rRNA was provided by Dr. M. L. Brown, Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Ridgefield, CT. Plasmid EL1-BS, containing partial human E-selectin cDNA, was provided by Dr. L. Osborn, Biogen, Cambridge, MA. Agarose, actinomycin D, LipofectAMINE, and RPMI were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Riboprobe Gemini System II and RNase-free DNase were purchased from Promega Biotech. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from Hyclone Laboratories. [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), and [α-32P]UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. The antisense oligomer ISIS 1570 (5′-TGGGAGCCATAGCGAGGCTGA-3′) to the 5′ end of the ICAM-1 cDNA and a nonsense oligomer (5′-AGTCGGAGCGATACCGAGGGT-3′) were generous gifts from Sterling-Winthrop Drug Co., Rensselaer, NY. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA). ICAM-1 luciferase reporter gene plasmids were gifts from Dr. C. Stratowa, Vienna, Austria. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) at the first passage were purchased from Clonetics Corp. (San Diego, CA). HUVEC were grown on fibronectin-coated flasks or plates in RPMI medium containing 10-20% fetal calf serum, 6.5 μg/ml endothelial-derived growth factor from bovine neural tissue, and 75 μg/ml heparin. All experiments used cells under the eighth passage. EAhy926 cells, a hybrid cell line of HUVEC and A549 cell line (derived from human lung epithelial type II cells), was provided by Dr. Edgell (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) and cultured as described (11Edgell C.-J. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). EAhy926 cells retain endothelial cell morphology and express the endothelial cell-specific marker human factor VIII-related antigen (11Edgell C.-J. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). EAhy926 cells were maintained in DMEM-high glucose, in 5% CO2, 10% fetal calf serum, and passaged by removal in trypsin-EDTA buffer (0.14 M NaCl, 2.68 mM KCl, 0.42 mM NaH2PO4, 0.012 M NaHCO3, 0.01 M dextrose, 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mM EDTA). Confluent cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM (without phenol red) containing 20 mM HEPES and incubated for 2 h before treatment with the agents described below. The experiments using the inhibitors (PDTC, N-Cys(Ac), or 3-AB) required a 1-h preincubation period in serum-free medium with each inhibitor, and treatment was continued during the 1-h H2O2 exposure period. The ICAM-1 LUC reporter plasmid and its 5′ deletion derivatives have been described previously (41Voraberger G. Schafer R. Stratowa C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2777-2786PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length ICAM-1 promoter construct contains approximately 1.4 kb of ICAM-1 5′-flanking DNA linked to the firefly luciferase (LUC) gene. Transfection into cells showed that this ICAM-1 construct was responsive to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and TNFα (41Voraberger G. Schafer R. Stratowa C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2777-2786PubMed Google Scholar). The macrophage scavenger receptor constructs containing three copies of the AP-1/Ets element or mutations of the element linked to luciferase have been described previously (45Wu H. Moulton K. Horval A. Parik S. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2129-2139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection at 5 × 105 cells per 6-cm plate. The cells were refed with fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum 4 h before lipofection (24Malone R.W. Felgner P.L. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6077-6081Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) with LipofectAMINE as described by Life Technologies, Inc. Transfection of 100-mm plates at 80% confluency typically contained 8 μg of reporter plasmid (ICAM-1 LUC) and 2 μg of β-gal expression plasmid DNA. The cells were transfected for 5 to 14 h. After a recovery period, the cells were divided into five 35-mm plates. At 24 h before treatment with H2O2 (concentration range 100-400 μM), TNFα (100 units/ml) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml), the cells were incubated in medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum. The cell extract was prepared and assayed for luciferase activity using Promega Biotec assay systems and β-galactosidase activity using the Tropix (Bedford, MA) assay system. Protein content was determined using a Bio-Rad protein determination kit. Mean luciferase activity per μg of protein extract was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity (which in control experiments was not affected by H2O2). All solutions used for RNA analysis were treated with diethylpyrocarbonate (0.1%) and sterilized or prepared in sterile diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. Glassware was baked at 240°C for a minimum of 4 h to remove traces of RNase. Total RNA was isolated according to the procedure of 8Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62787) Google Scholar. Medium was removed, and the endothelial cell layer was rinsed with ice-cold, Ca2+ -and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed in acid guanidine thiocyanate. The lysate was drawn through a 26-gauge needle and extracted with acid phenol/chloroform (5:1). After a 30-60-min incubation on ice, the mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × g. The aqueous phase was collected and RNA was precipitated with equal volume of ice-cold isopropyl alcohol. After allowing the RNA to precipitate for 1 h at −70°C, RNA was pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 12,000 × g. The RNA pellet was washed twice with 75% ethanol, briefly dried, and dissolved in 0.5% SDS in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. Quantification and purity of RNA were assessed by A260/A280 absorption, and RNA samples with ratios above 1.9 were used for further analysis. The RNA samples (20 μg/lane) were subjected to gel electrophoresis in denaturing 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred overnight in 20 × SSC (3 M sodium chloride, 0.3 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0) to Duralose-UVTM nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were baked for 2 h in vacuo at 80°C to fix the RNA. Blots were prehybridized for 30 min at 68°C in QuikHybTM solution and hybridized for 2 h at 68°C with random-primed 32P-labeled probes. After hybridization, the blots were washed twice for 15 min each at room temperature in 2 × SSC with 0.1% SDS followed by 2 washes for 30 min each at 60°C in 0.1 × SSC with 0.1% SDS. The washed blots were exposed to Hybond film (Amersham) for 12 to 48 h at −70°C using an intensifying screen. The signal intensities were quantified by scanning the autoradiograms with the Beckman R112 densitometer. All blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled probes of ICAM-1 cDNA (0.96-kb SalI to PstI fragment) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1.1 kb PstI fragment). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal control for RNA loading and normalized by densitometry of the ICAM-1 signal. For treatment of HUVEC with antisense and nonsense oligonucleotides, the cells were rinsed as described above with serum-free DMEM and incubated for 4 h in serum-free DMEM medium with addition of 5 μg/ml Lipofectin and an oligonucleotide at concentrations of 50 and 100 nM. After incubation, the medium was removed, fresh medium containing Lipofectin and the particular oligonucleotide was added, and the cells were treated for 1 h with 100 μM H2O2. RNA was isolated and processed for Northern analysis. Nuclei were isolated from HUVEC (3-5 × 107) according to the procedure described by 9Clayton D.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, harvested by scraping, and centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 rpm. The cell pellet was washed once with ice-cold PBS and once with RSB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, and 3.0 mM MgCl2). The cells were suspended in 10 ml of RSB and incubated on ice for 10 min. The cell pellets were collected by centrifugation, when the cells were sufficiently swollen as monitored by microscopy. Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of RSB and homogenized with a dounce type B homogenizer. The homogenate was treated briefly with 0.1% Triton X-100 to remove cytoplasmic tags. The nuclear pellet was collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 1500 rpm at 4°C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 210 μl of freezing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 40% glycerol), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. The nuclei were incubated for 30 min at 30°C in 0.3 ml of the assay mixture (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.25 mM concentration each of ATP, CTP, and GTP, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 325 mM KCl, and 250 μCi of [α-32P]UTP). RNase-free DNase (20 μl of 2 μg/ml) was added and incubated for an additional 15 min at 30°C. The run-on reaction was terminated by the addition of 36 μl of 10 × SET buffer (10% SDS, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mM EDTA). Proteinase K (100 μg) was added and incubated for 45 min at 37°C, and the reaction mixture was extracted once with buffer-saturated phenol/chloroform (1:1) and once with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The aqueous phase was collected, ammonium sulfate (final concentration of 2.3 M) was added, and the RNA was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol. After 1 h at −70°C, the RNA was pelleted and washed twice with 75% ethanol. The pellet was dissolved in 100 μl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mM EDTA) and passed through a Sephadex G-50 column to remove any unincorporated nucleotides. Filters were prepared for hybridization by application of denatured plasmids (5 μg/slot) using a slot blot apparatus. Plasmids containing cDNAs for ICAM-1, E-selectin, ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used for the experiments. Baked filters were hybridized with the RNA in the run-on assay as described for Northern analysis, and autoradiograms were developed. HUVEC were prepared for nuclear extracts as described by 38Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA (NY). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar. Briefly, the cells were treated with H2O2, TNFα (100 units/ml) or medium for 1 h prior to harvesting. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and collected by centrifugation (Sorvall RT6000) for 5 min at 2,000 rpm. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes of hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.75 mM spermidine, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1.0 mM DTT, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM PMSF) and incubated on ice for 10 min to allow the cells to swell. Cells were collected by centrifugation (Sorvall RT6000) for 7.5 min at 3,000 rpm in the cold. The cell pellet was resuspended in twice the original volume of ice-cold hypotonic buffer. Cells were homogenized with 30 strokes of a Wheaton dounce glass homogenizer (pestle B), followed by the addition of one-tenth volume of restore buffer (2.2 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 0.75 mM spermidine, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1.0 mM DTT, 10 mM KCl, and 0.5 mM PMSF). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation (Sorvall RC2-B) at 10,000 rpm in a Sorvall HB4 rotor in the cold for 3.5 min. The nuclei pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of nuclei lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.42 M NaCl, 0.75 mM spermidine, 0.15 spermine, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, 2.0 mM DTT, 25% glycerol, and 0.5 mM PMSF). Nuclear debris was removed by ultracentrifugation (Beckman L8-M ultracentrifuge) at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti80 fixed angle rotor for 90 min at 1°C, and 0.33 g of finely powdered ammonium sulfate was added to each milliliter of the collected supernatant and mixed gently by rocking in the cold for 60 to 90 min until the ammonium sulfate was completely dissolved. The precipitated nuclear protein was collected by ultracentrifugation (Beckman L8-M) at 30,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti80 fixed angle rotor for 20 min at 1°C. Nuclear protein pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of nuclear dialysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 2.0 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM PMSF) and dialyzed twice for 90 min against 200 ml of NDB in the cold. Nuclear extracts were cleared of insoluble material by microcentrifugation for 10 min, and 30 μl of nuclear protein extracts were aliquoted and stored in a liquid nitrogen freezer until use. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad assay kit. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described by 33Roebuck K.A. Brenner D.A. Kagnoff M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1336-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar. Nuclear extracts prepared from HUVEC by the method of 38Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA (NY). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar were incubated with 50,000 cpm (~0.1 to 0.5 ng) of various 32P-end-labeled double-stranded synthetic deoxyoligonucleotide probes for 30 min at 25°C in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 12% glycerol, 12 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 60 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 4 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.6 mM EDTA (pH 7.9), 0.6 mM DTT, and 1 μg of poly(dI)•(dC). DNA probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 μCi/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled DNA probe was purified on push columns (Stratagene). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved in 5% native polyacrylamide gels pre-electrophoresed for 30-60 min at room temperature in 0.25 × TBE buffer (22.5 mM Tris borate and 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.3). Dried gels were exposed overnight to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at −70°C. Oligonucleotides used for the gel shift analysis were as follows: ICAM-1 AP-1/Ets, 5′-GCTGCTGCCTCAGTTTCCC-3′; ICAM-1 NF-κB, 5′-GCCCGGGGAGGATTCCTGGGCCCC-3′; ICAM-1 TRE, 5′-GACCGTGATTCAAGCTTA-3′; ICAM-1 AP-1 motif, 5′-TGGCCAGTGACTCGCAGCCCCAGC-3′; AP-1 m/Ets, 5′-GCTGCgtaagacGTTTCCCAGC-3′; AP-1/Ets-m, 5′-GCTGCTGCCTCAGTcagtCAGC-3′. Sequence motifs within the oligonucleotide are underlined, the mutations are in lowercase, and the relative positions of the sequence motifs are shown in Figure 7:, Figure 8:. The NF-κB oligonucleotide corresponds to the element upstream of the AP-3 site and downstream of the AP-1/Ets repeats. We have previously reported that exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to 100 μM H2O2 for 1 h resulted in maximal accumulation of steady-state ICAM-1 message, which could be detected as early as 30 min after oxidant exposure (22Lo S.K.

To determine whether the H2O2-induced increase in ICAM-1 mRNA was the result of increased de novo synthesis of the message or decreased rate of message degradation, we examined the effects of actinomycin D, a RNA synthesis inhibitor. We carried out two experiments: (i) actinomycin D was added to the cells at the same time as H2O2 exposure (Fig. 1) and (ii) cells were first pretreated with H2O2 for 1 h to maximize the expression of ICAM-1 message followed by treatment with actinomycin D to block new mRNA synthesis (Fig. 2). Treatment with actinomycin D at the time of H2O2 exposure (50 μM or 100 μM) abrogated ICAM-1 message induction (Fig. 1; compare lanes 2 and 3 with 4 and 5). To examine the effect of H2O2 on mRNA stability, endothelial cells were first exposed to 100 μM H2O2 for 1 h to maximize ICAM-1 expression, and this was followed by treatment with actinomycin D. Total RNA was isolated at 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 h after actinomycin D, and steady-state levels of ICAM-1 mRNA were analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig. 2). The H2O2-induced mRNA level returned to baseline level at 0.5 h (lane 3) and remained at this level up to 2 h (lanes 4-6). Both actinomycin D experiments indicated that H2O2 increased the synthesis of ICAM-1 mRNA. Fig. 3 compares the transcription rate of ICAM-1 with that of E-selectin, ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as determined by nuclear run-on analysis. The transcription rates of E-selectin, rRNA, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were unaffected by H2O2 over the 2-h time course. In contrast, H2O2 increased the rate of ICAM-1 transcription at 1 h, and the rate remained high at 2 h, a finding that correlates with the H2O2 induction of ICAM-1 message (22Lo S.K. Janakidevi K. Lai L. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L406-L412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that H2O2 activates ICAM-1 gene transcription. We transfected a complementary ICAM-1 oligonucleotide that targets the 5′ end of the ICAM-1 mRNA (Fig. 4), to determine whether H2O2-induced ICAM-1 mRNA expression was sensitive to antisense deoxyoligonucleotides. The transfected HUVEC were exposed for 1 h with 100 μM H2O2 and analyzed by Northern blot for ICAM-1 mRNA expression. Lipofection with the antisense oligonucleotide produced a concentration-dependent reduction in the ICAM-1 message (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 5). Neither control (nonsense oligonucleotide used as a negative control in lanes 4 and 6 or lipofection alone in lane 1) affected ICAM-1 mRNA expression. These data indicated that antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the ICAM-1 mRNA prevented the H2O2-induced ICAM-1 transcription. We used three agents to investigate possible mechanisms underlying the induction of ICAM-1. These agents were selected to study the DNA binding proteins AP-1 (Jun/Fos) and NF-κB, transcription factors known to be modulated by redox mechanisms (1Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar; 25Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). We used 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB), an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, to target AP-1 since 3-AB inhibited oxidant-induced c-fos expression and AP-1 binding activity (2Amstad P.A. Krupitza G. Cerutti P.A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3952-3960PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-oxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) was used to target NF-κB since PDTC inhibited oxidant-induced NF-κB activity without affecting AP-1 binding activity (35Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). N-Acetylcysteine (N-Cys(Ac)), a general antioxidant and precursor of glutathione (40Toledano M.M. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4328-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar; 1Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar), was used to alter the redox state of cells. As shown in Fig. 5, 3-AB abrogated the induction of ICAM-1 message (lane 3), whereas PDTC had no effect (lane 4) suggesting a role for AP-1 in the induction of endothelial ICAM-1 transcription by H2O2. Pretreatment of endothelial cells for 1 h with N-Cys(Ac) also prevented the H2O2-induced mRNA expression (lane 5). We prepared nuclear protein extracts from endothelial cells treated with H2O2 for 1 h and examined DNA binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay to study the effects of H2O2 on AP-1 and NF-κB binding activities (Fig. 6). H2O2 stimulated DNA binding activity on AP-1-like binding sites of the ICAM-1 promoter (lanes 1-9), but this was not the case with NF-κB binding activity (lanes 10-12) consistent with the inhibitor studies above.

There is controversy regarding whether radical generation is caused by enzyme formation or that of its substrates xanthine and hypoxanthine. Therefore, studies were performed in isolated rat hearts correlating the magnitude and time course of radical generation with alterations in xanthine oxidase and its substrates. Radical generation was measured by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and correlated with spectrophotometric assays of tissue xanthine oxidase activity and chromatographic measurement of tissue and effluent concentrations of xanthine oxidase substrates and products. Xanthine oxidase was present in preischemic hearts and slightly increased during 30-min global ischemia. Hypoxanthine and xanthine were not present prior to ischemia but accumulated greatly during ischemia due to ATP degradation. These substrate concentrations rapidly declined over the first 5 min of reperfusion matching the observed time course of radical generation, whereas xanthine oxidase activity was largely unchanged. Both substrates were also observed in the coronary effluent during the first 5 min of reflow along with the product uric acid. Thus, the burst of xanthine oxidase-mediated free radical generation upon reperfusion is triggered and its time course controlled by a large increase in substrate formation that occurs secondary to the degradation of ATP during ischemia.

Oxygen free radical generation has been proposed to be an important mechanism of cellular injury in ischemic and reperfused tissues(1Kukreja R.C. Hess M.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 1992; 26: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 2Simpson P.J. Lucchesi B.R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1987; 110: 13-30PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in a variety of tissues, including heart, lung, kidney, and brain, have demonstrated that intravascular administration of antioxidant enzymes or free radical-scavenging drugs can prevent reperfusion damage and improve postischemic function(3Cerutti P.A.

Recently, free radical generation has been measured in ischemic tissues with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Both direct and spin trapping EPR techniques have demonstrated that there is a burst of oxygen free radical generation in the heart after postischemic reperfusion(5Zweier J.L. Flaherty J.T.

It was further demonstrated that the administration of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, solely upon reperfusion, can prevent contractile dysfunction and quench free radical generation(6Zweier J.L.

Circulation. 1986; 74: 1424-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Although several mechanisms have been demonstrated to be involved in the generation of oxygen free radicals, xanthine oxidase has been proposed to be a central mechanism in a variety of postischemic cells and tissues(10McCord J.M.

Although there has been controversy regarding whether this mechanism occurs in human cells and tissues, recent studies have shown that the enzyme is present in human endothelial cells and is responsible for free radical generation in reoxygenated human endothelial cells(13Zweier J.L.

In reperfused tissues, xanthine oxidase in the presence of its substrates hypoxanthine or xanthine reduces molecular oxygen to O2− and H2O2, which can further react to form the more reactive OH(14Kuppusamy P.

Chem. 1990; 265: 6656-6663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The OH and O2− radicals produced by the enzyme can then in turn react with cellular proteins and membranes inducing cellular injury. In particular, it was hypothesized that in ischemic tissues xanthine dehydrogenase, which reduces NAD to NADH, is converted via proteolytic cleavage to xanthine oxidase(10McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4999) Google Scholar, 16Parks D.A. Granger D.N. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1986; 548: 87-99Google Scholar). This increase in xanthine oxidase activity has been proposed to play a key role in triggering postischemic free radical generation. It has been demonstrated that the enzyme and its substrates are present and give rise to a burst of free radical generation upon postischemic reperfusion in the isolated rat heart, as well as in bovine and human endothelial cells, but considerable controversy still remains regarding the process by which ischemia and reperfusion triggers xanthine oxidase-mediated free radical generation(12Zweier J.L.

Despite extensive study over the last decade, the regulation and control of this important mechanism of free radical generation and cellular injury is largely unknown. Questions remain regarding whether it is enzyme or substrate formation that triggers the burst in free radical generation which occurs upon postischemic reperfusion(10McCord J.M. N. Engl. J.

The precise effect of alterations in myocardial enzyme and substrate concentrations in controlling the time course of free radical generation is also unknown. Therefore, controversy has remained regarding the role of xanthine oxidase and its radical-generating substrates in triggering the presence and time course of free radical generation in the postischemic heart. In the present study, experiments were performed to evaluate the role of alterations in xanthine oxidase and its substrates hypoxanthine and xanthine during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion in triggering the presence and controlling the time course of free radical generation in the postischemic rat heart. Experiments were performed correlating the time course of free radical generation, with alterations in xanthine oxidase activity and the concentrations of its free radical-generating substrates, during the process of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. These studies indicate that substrate availability is the primary factor in triggering and controlling xanthine oxidase-mediated free radical generation in the postischemic heart. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were heparinized and anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital. The hearts were excised, the aorta was cannulated, and retrograde perfusion was initiated. Hearts were perfused at a constant pressure of 80 mm Hg using Krebs bicarbonate buffer consisting of 120 mM NaCl, 17 mM glucose, 25 mM NaHCO3, 5.9 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 2.0 mM CaCl2, and bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 gas at 37°C as described previously(15Thompson-Gorman S.L. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6656-6663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 15 min of equilibration with normal perfusate, the hearts were subjected to 30-min global ischemia and variable time of reflow according to the experimental purpose. Studies were performed using the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO). 1The abbreviations used are: DMPO5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxidePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideDTTdithiothreitolHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. The DMPO (>97% pure) was purchased from Aldrich and further purified by double distillation. DMPO was infused through a sidearm located just proximal to the heart perfusion cannula with a final concentration of 40 mM(5Zweier J.L. Flaherty J.T. Weisfeldt M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EPR spectra were recorded in flat cells at room temperature with a Bruker-IBM ER 300 spectrometer operating at X-band with a TM 110 cavity using a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, modulation amplitude of 0.5 G, microwave power of 20 milliwatts, microwave frequency of 9.77 GHz, and acquisition of 10 1-min scans. Quantitation of the free radical signals was performed by comparing the double integral of the observed signal to that of a known concentration of the 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinoxy free radical in aqueous solution as described previously(12Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Lutty G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 13Zweier J.L. Broderick R. Kuppusamy P. Thompson-Gorman S.L. Lutty G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24156-24162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control hearts were perfused for 15 min and then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ischemic and reperfused hearts were subjected to global ischemia for 30 min followed by variable duration of reflow and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen hearts were finely ground under liquid nitrogen and homogenized in 5 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), which prevented the in vitro conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase. A small amount of homogenate was removed for assay of total protein content by Lowry assay(23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homogenates were spun at 600 × g for 20 min at −4°C, and the supernatants were centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min at 4°C. The lipid layer was removed, and the supernatants were passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (Phamarcia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with the phosphate buffer. The processed effluent was assayed spectrophotometrically at 295 nm for uric acid production in the presence of 60 μM xanthine using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer as described previously(13Zweier J.L.

Chem. 1990; 265: 6656-6663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 0.2 ml of effluent, in 50 mM phosphate buffer containing PMSF and DTT, and 60 μM xanthine in a 1-ml cuvette at 37°C for the measurement of xanthine oxidase activity. For determination of total xanthine dehydrogenase plus oxidase activity, measurements were performed after the addition of 0.6 mM NAD+ to the reaction mixture. Enzyme activity was expressed in milliunits/g of protein, where 1 unit of activity equals 1 μmol of substrate converted to uric acid per min. After 15-min perfusion with equilibration of contractile function, hearts were frozen in liquid nitrogen as a preischemic control. For ischemic and reperfusion measurements, hearts were subjected to further 30-min periods of global ischemia or 30 min ischemia followed by variable duration of reflow. The hearts were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen at the desired time point and then ground under liquid nitrogen. Then the frozen tissue was transferred to a glass homogenizer with a Teflon pastel and allowed to thaw with homogenization in 10 ml of 0.5 M perchloric acid at 4°C. Acid extraction continued on ice for 15 min, at which time cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1 min. The acid extract was neutralized by mixing with 20 ml of Freon/trioctylamine (4:1) for 30 s. The mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 min, and the upper aqueous layer was recovered and passed through a 0.45-μm Millipore filter, then stored at −80°C for analysis. A separate series of hearts was studied with collection of effluent perfusate prior to ischemia and after reflow to determine the time course of xanthine oxidase substrate and product release in the coronary effluent. 30-s collections of perfusate were performed at each sampling time, and these perfusate samples were simply passed through 0.45-μm Millipore filters prior to HPLC analysis. Reversed-phase HPLC was performed using a procedure similar to that of Hull-Ryde et al.(24Hull-Ryde E.A. Lewis W.R. Veronee C.D. Jowe J. J. Chromatogr. Biomed. Appl. 1986; 377: 165-174Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using a Waters μBondapak C18 column and a Waters the HPLC system (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) with a model 484 UV detector, two model 510 reciprocating pumps, and Maxima software, as described previously(13Zweier J.L. Broderick R. Kuppusamy P. Thompson-Gorman S.L. Lutty G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24156-24162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. The statistical significance of the differences between the groups were calculated using Student's t test for independent means. Two-tailed values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. It has been reported previously that a burst of free radical generation occurs in the isolated rat heart upon postischemic reperfusion, which can be measured using the spin trap DMPO, and this radical generation was shown to be inhibited by the xanthine oxidase blocker oxypurinol(15Thompson-Gorman S.L. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6656-6663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that there is a temporal window of ischemic duration which results in maximum free radical generation after reperfusion, with maximum radical generation observed after an ischemic duration of 30 min(7Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Williams R. Rayburn B.K. Smith D. Weisfeldt M.L. Flaherty J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, experiments were performed measuring the time course of cardiac free radical generation following 30-min ischemia. The coronary effluent containing the spin trap DMPO was collected in 20-s aliquots during both preischemic and postischemic infusion and EPR measurements were performed. No significant signal was observed prior to ischemia; however, a prominent spectrum was seen immediately after the onset of reflow (Fig. 1). This spectrum consisted of a large 1:2:2:1 quartet signal, aH = aN = 14.9 G, indicative of DMPO-OH, and a small 1:1:1:1:1:1 sextet signal, aH = 16.0 and aN = 22.0 G, indicative of DMPO-R. Maximum signal intensity was observed at 20-40 s of reflow and then this signal decreased over the next 5 min of reperfusion. After 5 min of reflow, the amplitude of observed free radical signals was decreased to less than 15% of the maximum observed signal. No significant signal was observed after 10 min of reperfusion (Fig. 2). In a series of four hearts similar magnitude and time course of free radical generation were seen to that shown in Fig. 1, with peak radical concentrations observed in the range of 180-240 nM occurring over the first minute of reperfusion followed by a rapid decline over the next 5 min.Figure 2:Graph of the time course of total free radical generation in the pre- and postischemic rat heart. Data were obtained from the intensity of the EPR spectra observed from the coronary effluent of hearts perfused with 40 mM DMPO as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Data are shown with a break in the reperfusion time axis between 120 and 300 s, after which the scale is condensed in order to depict the complete time course of free radical generation after the 30-min period of ischemia.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to evaluate the contribution of alterations in myocardial xanthine oxidase activity in triggering and controlling the time course of free radical generation, spectrophotometric assays were performed to measure the activity of this enzyme in preischemic and postischemic hearts. DTT together with the protease inhibitor PMSF was used to prevent the proteolytic or oxidative conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase during tissue processing. In order to assure that the DTT did not convert xanthine oxidase back to xanthine dehydrogenase, additional experiments were performed in homogenates prepared in the absence of DTT. As reported previously(15Thompson-Gorman S.L. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6656-6663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), identical xanthine oxidase activities were observed in the presence or absence of DTT, indicating that the DTT did not significantly convert xanthine oxidase back to xanthine dehydrogenase. Both control and postischemic heart tissue contained significant xanthine oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase activity. As shown in the representative tracings (Fig. 3), prominent xanthine oxidase activity was present and corresponded to about 7% of the total xanthine oxidase plus xanthine dehydrogenase activity. After 30-min ischemia and 10-min reperfusion the activity of xanthine oxidase was increased by about 30%. A series of hearts were studied to characterize the time course of alterations in xanthine oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase activity during ischemia and reflow (Fig. 4). In preischemic hearts, the activity of xanthine oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase were 8.4 ± 1.2 and 130 ± 28 milliunits/g of protein, respectively. After 30 min of ischemia, there was no significant change in total xanthine oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase activity. However, the activity of xanthine oxidase markedly increased to 16.8 ± 1.2 (p < 0.05, versus preischemia) after 1-min reperfusion. Over the subsequent 45-min period of reperfusion the activity of xanthine oxidase remained 30-50% higher than that observed in preischemic control hearts. While some decrease in the activity was seen between 2 and 10 min of reflow, overall the activity of xanthine dehydrogenase was not significantly altered during the time course of reflow. In plots of the ratio of xanthine oxidase activity to xanthine oxidase plus xanthine dehydrogenase activity it was observed that the percent xanthine oxidase increased from base-line values of 7% prior to ischemia to peak values of 11% after reflow. Since only a small increase was seen, this indicates that at most only a small fraction of the xanthine dehydrogenase may have been converted to xanthine oxidase. While the increases in xanthine oxidase activity observed during reperfusion could contribute to the increase in free radical generation which occurs upon reperfusion, these changes are relatively modest and cannot explain the absence of radical generation prior to ischemia or the time course which occurs.Figure 4:Graphs showing the time course of alterations in xanthine oxidase (XO), xanthine dehydrogenase (XD), and the ratio of XO to (XO+XD) in the rat hearts prior to ischemia and after 30-min ischemia with different durations of reperfusion. Data are shown with a break in the reperfusion time axis between 120 and 300 s, after which the scale is condensed in order to depict the complete time course throughout the 45-min period of reflow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since free radical generation from xanthine oxidase is also controlled by the concentration of the available substrates, xanthine and hypoxanthine, experiments were performed to measure the presence and magnitude of the alterations in the concentrations of these substrates in the postischemic heart. Reversed-phase HPLC of heart extracts was performed to measure the intracellular adenine nucleotide pool of normal and postischemic hearts. As shown in Fig. 5a, and reported previously(13Zweier J.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24156-24162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), each of the cellular nucleotides and their metabolites have unique retention times allowing measurement and quantitation. In the preischemic heart, ATP comprises a major part of total adenine pool, as well as ADP and AMP. As shown in Fig. 5b, prior to ischemia, a large ATP peak and smaller ADP peak are seen, whereas no xanthine or hypoxanthine peaks are observed. After 30-min ischemia the ATP peak is greatly decreased, with a large increase in the AMP peak and the appearance of prominent xanthine and hypoxanthine peaks. After 5 min of reflow the xanthine and hypoxanthine peaks are decreased and are again almost undetectable. In a series of 27 hearts, 3 for each time point, HPLC measurements were performed, and the concentration of each metabolite was quantitated from these chromatograms and values were normalized for protein content (Fig. 6). At the end of 30 min of ischemia, the ATP level decreased to 7.14 ± 0.4 nmol/mg of protein compared with a preischemic value of 33.4 ± 0.5 nmol/mg of protein (p < 0.01). During reperfusion, ATP concentrations showed a slight recovery but remained depressed compared with preischemic values (Fig. 6, top panel). No hypoxanthine, xanthine, or uric acid were detected in preischemic hearts (Fig. 5b and 6). After 30 min of ischemia, however, significant hypoxanthine and xanthine formation and accumulation occurred (Fig. 5c), with average concentrations of 2.18 ± 0.27 and 2.41 ± 0.22 nmol/mg of protein, respectively. After the onset of reflow, hypoxanthine and xanthine levels rapidly decreased. After 5 min of reperfusion, no significant hypoxanthine and xanthine peaks were observed in the myocardium (Fig. 6).Figure 6:Time course of the alterations in ATP, hypoxanthine, and xanthine concentrations in isolated rat hearts during ischemia and reperfusion. Data are shown from preischemic hearts, hearts subjected to 30-min global ischemia, and hearts subjected to different durations of reflow.

One possibility is that hypoxanthine and xanthine were converted by xanthine oxidase to form uric acid with accompanying oxygen free radical generation. Another possibility is that reflow may wash out these substrates from the heart. To determine the release of xanthine oxidase substrates and products, coronary effluent was collected in 30-s intervals prior to ischemia and after postischemic reperfusion. 33 samples were studied from a series of 3 hearts, and HPLC measurements were performed on each sample. Representative chromatograms of the effluent from a heart prior to and after reflow are shown in Fig. 7. Prior to ischemia no hypoxanthine and xanthine peaks were seen, and no significant uric acid peak was detected in coronary effluent. After reflow, however, large hypoxanthine and xanthine peaks were observed along with a large peak from the xanthine oxidase product uric acid (Fig. 7b). Maximum substrate and product peaks were seen over the first 30 s of reflow and then peak height declined over the next 5 min until only trace peaks were seen. The amount of xanthine, hypoxanthine, and uric acid in each 30 s effluent sample was quantitated. In the effluent from the first 30 s of reflow, average values of 1.1 ± 0.3 and 3.1 ± 0.8 nmol were observed for hypoxanthine and xanthine, respectively, with a value of 2.5 ± 0.5 nmol for uric acid. The observed amounts of both the substrates hypoxanthine and xanthine as well as the product uric acid rapidly decreased in the following 2 min of reflow, until after 5-min reperfusion, no hypoxanthine, xanthine, or uric acid was measured in coronary effluent (Fig. 8). The time course observed for xanthine oxidase substrate and product formation in the heart tissue and coronary effluent closely correlated with that observed in the EPR spin trapping measurements of free radical generation, suggesting that the presence and time course of free radical generation was triggered and controlled primarily by the availability of enzyme substrates.Figure 8:Graph of the amount of xanthine, hypoxanthine, and uric acid measured in the coronary effluent from preischemic and reperfused hearts by HPLC. Data are shown with a break in the reperfusion time axis between 150 and 300 s, after which the scale is condensed in order to depict the complete time course before ischemia and throughout the 45-min period of reflow.

Xanthine oxidase has been proposed to be a major primary source of free radical generation. This hypothesis was initially supported by many studies which demonstrated that administration of the xanthine oxidase inhibitors allopurinol or oxypurinol reduced infarct size and improved functional recovery(17Chambers D.E.

Braimbridge M.V. Hearse D.J. Ann. Thorac. Surg. 1987; 44: 291-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); however, subsequently these results have been questioned by other laboratories who have questioned whether the enzyme xanthine oxidase or its substrates are present and whether it can cause reperfusion injury (26Reimer K.A. Jennings R.B. Circulation. 1985; 71: 1069-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 27Eddy L.J. Stewart J.R. Jones H.P. Engerson T.D. McCord J.M. Downey J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: H709-H711PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, further direct evidence for the presence of xanthine oxidase-mediated free radical generation in postischemic cells and tissues has been provided by EPR studies(12Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Lutty G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 13Zweier J.L. Broderick R. Kuppusamy P. Thompson-Gorman S.L. Lutty G.A. J.

It has been demonstrated that a burst of xanthine oxidase-mediated radical generation occurs upon reperfusion and is the major source of free radicals in the isolated rat heart. This burst of radical generation can be blocked by the xanthine oxidase inhibitor oxypurinol (15Thompson-Gorman S.L. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6656-6663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we observe that the burst of radical generation peaks during the first minute of reperfusion with little, if any, radical generation continuing after 5 min. A number of studies have shown that endothelial cells from animal species as well as humans contain xanthine oxidase and similarly give rise to the formation of oxygen free radicals at the time of reoxygenation(12Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Lutty G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 13Zweier J.L. Broderick R. Kuppusamy P. Thompson-Gorman S.L. Lutty G.A. J.

In human aortic endothelial cells we have demonstrated that free radical generation occurs due to xanthine oxidase substrate formation in the presence of the enzyme. However, in these isolated cellular preparations the observed free radical generation persists for more than 30 min after reoxygenation. Therefore, while xanthine oxidase-mediated free radical generation has been observed both in isolated endothelial cells and whole tissues such as the heart, clear differences in the time course of radical generation are present that could not be explained previously. Although there is considerable evidence that xanthine oxidase-mediated free radical generation occurs in reperfused tissues, the precise nature of the enzyme and substrate control of the magnitude and time course of this process had not been elucidated. Both the formation and modulation of tissue concentrations of xanthine oxidase and its requisite substrates are factors that would be expected to limit and regulate the generation of free radicals in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury. McCord (10McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4999) Google Scholar, 11Roy R.S. McCord J.M. Greenwald R.A. Cohen G. Oxy Radicals and Their Scavenger Systems. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1983: 145-153Google Scholar) proposed that in ischemic tissues xanthine dehydrogenase undergoes proteolytic conversion to the oxidase that uses O2 as its electron acceptor with the formation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. This protease-mediated increase in xanthine oxidase activity was hypothesized to play a major role in triggering the generation of oxygen free radicals. Subsequently, it was proposed that this protease-dependent xanthine oxidase conversion was the major event triggering xanthine oxidase-mediated reperfusion injury (16Parks D.A. Granger D.N. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1986; 548: 87-99Google Scholar, 17Chambers D.E. Parks D.A. Patterson G. Roy R. McCord J.M. Yoshida S. Parmely L.F. Downey J.M. J. Mol.

Boucher F. de Leiris J. Favier A. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1992; 87: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have shown little if any conversion of dehydrogenase to oxidase in perfused rat hearts following periods of global ischemia. Similarly, in the present study we did observe that xanthine oxidase is present in the preischemic rat heart, with 7% of the dehydrogenase plus oxidase pool present as oxidase. While a 50-100% increase in xanthine oxidase activity was observed upon reperfusion, still only a small proportion of the xanthine dehydrogenase appeared to be converted to xanthine oxidase. Our results clearly demonstrate that although xanthine oxidase activity is somewhat increased in the postischemic heart, these alterations of xanthine oxidase activity alone do not explain the time course of free radical generation that is observed in the normal and postischemic heart. Prior to ischemia, xanthine oxidase is present, but no free radical generation is observed. Although the enzyme activity is increased after ischemia, it is largely unchanged throughout the time course of reflow; however, free radical generation is only observed during the first 5 min of reperfusion. These data indicate that although the presence of xanthine oxidase is an important requisite factor in the process of free radical generation, alterations in xanthine oxidase activity are not sufficient to account for the observed time course of radical generation and are not the major limiting factor in the process of free radical generation during postischemic reperfusion. It was also well known that during ischemia ATP is degraded to ADP, AMP, and adenosine, which could be further metabolized to inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine(21Abd-Elfattah A.S. Jessen M.E. Lekven J. Doherty III, N.E. Brunsting L.A. Wechsler A.S. Circulation. 1988; 78 (Suppl. III–): III224-III235PubMed Google Scholar, 30Jennings R.B. Steenbergen Jr., C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 727-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). McCord (10McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4999) Google Scholar) also proposed that this process of increased substrate formation could be an important factor in triggering xanthine oxidase-mediated free radical generation. In general, however, the presence and importance of this substrate control has been less emphasized in the literature. Abd-Elfattah et al.(21Abd-Elfattah A.S. Jessen M.E. Lekven J. Doherty III, N.E. Brunsting L.A. Wechsler A.S. Circulation. 1988; 78 (Suppl. III–): III224-III235PubMed Google Scholar, 22Abd-Elfattah A.S. Jessen M.E. Hanan S.A. Tuchy G. Wechsler A.S. Circulation. 1990; 80 (Suppl.

Drug Ther. 1987; 1: 210Google Scholar) have noted with in vivo surgical canine models of global ischemia and reflow that xanthine oxidase substrate formation is an important factor in the process of postischemic injury and have shown that pharmacological interventions aimed at decreasing substrate concentrations can decrease the severity of this injury. In the present study, we have observed that the alterations in myocardial xanthine oxidase substrate concentrations can explain the time course of radical generation which is observed. In preischemic hearts, no hypoxanthine and xanthine can be detected. During ischemia, hypoxanthine and xanthine accumulated due to the breakdown of ATP to AMP, adenosine, inosine, and finally hypoxanthine. At the end of ischemia, radical-generating substrate concentrations reach a maximal level in the myocardium. Upon reflow, O2 is reintroduced, then xanthine oxidase metabolizes xanthine and hypoxanthine with the formation of uric acid and the reduction of O2 to superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Myocardial substrate levels then rapidly decrease after the start of reflow, due to both substrate metabolism and washout, with the presence of the product uric acid as well as the substrates hypoxanthine and xanthine in the coronary effluent. Therefore, substrate limitation results in the gradual decline of free radical generation that is observed, despite the presence of xanthine oxidase. These results demonstrate that the burst of xanthine oxidase-mediated free radical generation that occurs in the postischemic rat heart is largely triggered and controlled by substrate availability. From the data obtained in this study it is possible to consider the roles of in vivo substrate control in the process of postischemic free radical generation. Metabolite concentrations within the heart can be estimated from the measured number of micromoles per gram of cell water, to increase by from near 0, less than 0.5 μM, prior to ischemia, to values of 576 or 628 μM for hypoxanthine and xanthine, respectively, after 30-min ischemia. This more than 1000-fold increase would be expected to have a marked effect on radical generation from the enzyme. The Km of xanthine oxidase for xanthine has been reported to be in the range of 11-36 μM(33Massey V. Brumby P.E. Komai H. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1682-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Ackerman E. Brill A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 56: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 35Mousson B. Desjacques P. Baltassat P. Enzyme. 1983; 29: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), therefore at least a 44-144-fold increase in radical generation would be expected. EPR spin trapping studies demonstrated that there was a marked increase in radical generation in the reperfused heart with more than a 40-fold increase seen. In studies of plasma concentrations of xanthine oxidase substrates in normal human plasma, similar low concentrations of hypoxanthine or xanthine have been reported with values in the range of 0.3-0.9 μM(36Ontyd J. Schrader J. J. Chromatogr. Biomed. Appl. 1984; 307: 404-409Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 37Lazzarino G. Raatikainen P. Nuutinen M. Nissinen J. Tavazzi B. Pierro D.D. Circulation. 1994; 90: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, in in vivo myocardial ischemia as occurs in human patients with coronary artery disease, xanthine oxidase substrate concentrations would be expected to have a similarly important role in modulating the process of radical generation from the enzyme. In the present experiments, myocardial flow was observed to be an important factor that effects the time course of xanthine oxidase-mediated free radical generation in the postischemic heart. Although it has been previously recognized that reflow is a critical event, since it results in reoxygenation and triggers the onset of oxygen free radical generation after the near anoxic conditions which occur during ischemia, it had not been considered that sustained flow could subsequently limit the duration of radical generation. In the present study, it was observed that myocardial flow is an important factor that effects the time course of substrate clearance and limits the duration of xanthine oxidase mediated free radical generation by decreasing the pool of available substrates. After postischemic reflow, large amounts of xanthine and hypoxanthine were present in the coronary effluent from the heart, and this substrate clearance paralleled the decrease in myocardial substrate concentration that was seen. This important effect of reflow may explain why xanthine oxidase-mediated free radical generation persists for a longer time in suspensions of reoxygenated endothelial cells than in the reperfused heart. In these static endothelial cell preparations, the high substrate concentrations observed (13Zweier J.L. Broderick R. Kuppusamy P. Thompson-Gorman S.L. Lutty G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24156-24162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) would be expected to remain elevated for prolonged periods of time in the absence of flow. Since substrate availability plays a limiting role in the process of free radical generation within postischemic myocardium, pharmacological approaches that decrease substrate formation may provide an alternative approach to that of radical scavenging compounds or direct xanthine oxidase blockers at preventing free radical generation and subsequent oxidant-mediated myocardial reperfusion injury. These approaches may also exert other beneficial effects, including salvage of high energy phosphates and increasing adenosine concentrations within the heart (32Pisarenko O.I. Lamkomkin V.L. Studneva I.M. Timoshin A.A. Kuzin A.I. Ruge E.K. Kapelko V.I. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1994; 51: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Conversely, increased xanthine oxide substrate formation that would occur from increased ATP degradation due to increased severity of supply demand imbalance during myocardial ischemia would be expected to result in increased xanthine oxidase-mediated free radical generation and postischemic injury, further exacerbating the process of myocardial injury which occurs secondary to ATP depletion. In conclusion, we have characterized the presence and time course of xanthine oxidase-mediated free radical generation in the postischemic heart, as well as the nature of enzyme or substrate control which occurs. Xanthine oxidase activity was present in the preischemic heart and significantly increased during ischemia and reperfusion. However, the observed time course of radical generation was largely triggered and controlled by the formation of the radical-generating substrates hypoxanthine and xanthine that accumulated during ischemia.

Adducin is a heteromer comprised of homologous α- and β-subunits with an NH2-terminal protease-resistant head domain, connected by a neck region to a COOH-terminal hydrophilic, protease-sensitive region. This study provides evidence that adducin in solution is a mixture of heterodimers and tetramers. CD spectroscopy of COOH-terminal domains of α- and β-adducin bacterial recombinants provides direct evidence for an unstructured random coil configuration. Cross-linking, proteolysis, and blot-binding experiments suggest a model for the adducin tetramer in which four head domains contact one another to form a globular core with extended interacting α- and β-adducin tails. The site for binding to spectrin-actin complexes on adducin was identified as the COOH-terminal tail of both the α- and β-adducin subunits. The capacity of native adducin to recruit spectrin to actin filaments is similar to that of adducin tail domains. Thus, adducin tail domains alone are sufficient to interact with F-actin and a single spectrin and to recruit additional spectrin molecules to the ternary complex.

The spectrin-based membrane skeleton was first isolated as a meshwork of integral and peripheral membrane proteins when erythrocytes were extracted with non-ionic detergents(1Yu J. Fischman D.A. Steck T.L. J. Supramol. Struct. 1973; 1: 233-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs of the stretched membrane skeleton reveal a regular lattice-like organization of 5-6 spectrin molecules linked in a polygonal array (2Byers T.J. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6153-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The vertices of this lattice are formed by short actin filaments of 12-14 monomers in length. Accessory proteins are found at the junctions where spectrin and actin interact: these include adducin, protein 4.1, dematin (protein 4.9), tropomyosin, and tropomodulin. These proteins are thought to be important in stabilizing spectrin-actin complexes, forming membrane associations, and assembling the membrane skeleton(3Bennett V. Gilligan D.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). This network of proteins was first defined in the red blood cell; however, many of the proteins present in the red cell membrane skeleton have closely related isoforms expressed in non-erythroid cells. The spectrin-actin lattice has thus far been visualized only in erythrocytes, and the organization of spectrin in different cells has yet to be defined. Adducin (adducere: to bring together) was first identified as a calmodulin-binding protein associated with the red cell membrane skeleton(4Gardner K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1339-1348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adducin binds to spectrin-actin complexes, is able to recruit a second spectrin molecule to this ternary complex(5Gardner K. Bennett V. Nature. 1987; 328: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and bundles actin filaments at high concentrations(6Mische S.M. Mooseker M.S. Morrow J.S. J.

Association of adducin with spectrin-actin complexes in in vitro assays has been interpreted as occurring through an ordered pathway with the following steps: spectrin and actin bind, adducin associates with the spectrin-actin complex, and then an additional spectrin molecule associates with the adducin-spectrin-actin ternary complex(5Gardner K.

In vitro activities of adducin suggest a function in constructing the spectrin-actin lattice. The pattern of expression of adducin is also consistent with a role in assembly of spectrin-actin complexes. Adducin is expressed early in erythroid differentiation at the proerythroblast stage and is present at the time when the spectrin skeleton is assembled(17Nehls V. Drenckhahn D. Joshi R. Bennett V. Blood. 1991; 78: 1692-1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adducin is localized at cell-cell contacts with spectrin and actin in cultured epithelial cells (18Kaiser H.W. O'Keefe E. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and no longer localizes to the plasma membrane of epithelial cells when β-spectrin is disrupted(19Hu R.-J. Moorthy S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). An adducin-like protein is associated with the hts phenotype of defective oocyte development in Drosophila(20Yue L. Spradling A.C. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2443-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The hts gene product is localized to ring canals, which are abundant in actin filaments and represent a specialized region of cell-cell contact. It has been speculated that mutant hts could affect ring canal formation either by disrupting actin filament binding directly, or indirectly by interfering with spectrin organization(21Robinson D.N. Cant K. Cooley L. Development. 1994; 120: 2015-2025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adducin thus may be involved with actin and spectrin in forming specialized contact sites in organisms as diverse as Drosophila and mammals. Adducin subunits are comprised of structurally distinct domains: an NH2-terminal 40 kDa globular head domain, an 8 kDa neck domain, and a COOH-terminal domain that has been predicted to be an extended tail(12Joshi R. Gilligan D.M. Otto E. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Joshi R. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13130-13136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COOH-terminal regions of adducin subunits have not been isolated from native adducin due to their protease sensitivity. These tail regions are difficult to visualize by electron microscopy and have been referred to as “fairy tails” due to their elusive properties. This report characterizes COOH-terminal domains expressed in bacteria, presents evidence for an extended configuration, and demonstrates that the tail domains of adducin are responsible for association with spectrin-actin complexes. In addition, domains involved in intersubunit contact between α- and β-subunits in an adducin tetramer are defined, and a model for organization of subunits in adducin tetramers is proposed. 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent, bovine serum albumin, HEPES, and sucrose were obtained from ICN.

Actin was isolated from an acetone powder of rabbit skeletal muscle as described (27Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A.

The Stokes radii (Rs) of native adducin, cross-linked adducin, native core domain, cross-linked V8 fragment, and α- and β-adducin tail constructs were estimated by gel filtration (29Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar) on Superose 6 and 12 columns equilibrated with 10 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM NaN3, pH 7.4, and calibrated with protein standards: catalase (Rs= 5.2 nm), aldolase (Rs = 4.8 nm), bovine serum albumin (Rs = 3.5 nm), ovalbumin (Rs = 2.84 nm), and cytochrome c (Rs = 2.0 nm). Sedimentation coefficients were estimated by rate-zonal sedimentation on 5-20% linear sucrose gradients (30Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) dissolved in 10 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaN3, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.4, and calibrated with standard proteins: catalase (11.3 S), aldolase (7.3 S), ovalbumin (3.5 S), bovine serum albumin (4.6 S), and cytochrome c (1.75 S). Circular dichroism experiments were performed on an Aviv 62 DS instrument. The samples were dialyzed into a buffer containing 5 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaF, and 0.5 mM NaN3, pH 7.4. Wavelength scans were performed from 190 to 280 nm at 4°C. The equation used to estimate percent helicity was taken from (31Chen Y. Yang J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) ([θ]222 = −30300fH- 2340, where fH represents helical fraction). Spectra for thermal melts were collected over the indicated temperature range at 222 nm. The rate of heating in these experiments was 1.0°C/0.5 min. The cDNAs encoding the COOH-terminal domains of the α- and β-adducin gene were cloned into the pGEMEX expression vector, a pET plasmid with a T7 promoter(32Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5980) Google Scholar). A unique NheI restriction site was generated by polymerase chain reaction. Constructs were inserted into the NheI site immediately 3′ to the AUG codon so that both expressed polypeptides have the additional amino acid sequence MAS on the amino terminus(33Davis L.H. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4409-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmids were first transformed into a non-expressor JM109 strain. Plasmids purified from the JM109 strain were later transformed into an expressor strain of E. coli (BL21 pLysS (DE3)). Expression of recombinant polypeptides was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. The bacteria were harvested at 4-h post-induction. Subsequent lysis and centrifugation revealed both the α- and β-adducin tail polypeptides to be in the soluble supernatant fractions. Since these constructs are heat stable, the 1% Triton X-100 bacterial lysates were further purified by heating to 70°C for 20 min and centrifuged at 140,000 × g. The soluble fraction was loaded onto a Mono S column and eluted with a linear 0-0.5 M NaBr gradient over 78 min. Both α- and β-adducin tail fractions eluted at 0.35-0.4 M NaBr. Typically, 15-20 mg of pure adducin tail construct can be purified/liter bacterial culture. The α-tail construct contains residues 430-737 and the β-tail construct encompasses residues 409-726 of the α- and β-adducin genes(12Joshi R. Gilligan D.M. Otto E. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Initial characterization of this protein had shown that the α- and β-subunits of adducin are present in a 1:1 stoichiometry, with an apparent molecular mass of 200 kDa which was interpreted as an adducin heterodimer(4Gardner K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1339-1348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of the α- and β-adducin genes demonstrated that the molecular mass of the subunits was actually 81 and 80 kDa, respectively, instead of the apparent molecular masses of 103 and 97 kDa estimated from migration on SDS-electrophoresis(12Joshi R. Gilligan D.M. Otto E. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, a dimer of adducin would have an actual molecular mass of 160 kDa. Chemical cross-linking experiments showed that adducin quantitatively cross-links to a tetramer (Fig. 1). This cross-linking to higher forms had initially been noted in a previous study(9Bennett V. Gardner K. Steiner J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5860-5869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major form of cross-linked adducin migrated at an estimated 350 kDa on SDS-PAGE, which would be a reasonable size for an adducin tetramer (Fig. 1). Cross-linked adducin contained α- and β-subunits as determined by immunoblots with subunit specific antibodies. The cross-linking reaction was sensitive to urea and high salt (Fig. 1, lanes 4-8), indicating that cross-linked oligomers involved specific protein-protein interactions and not merely nonspecific aggregation or collisions in solution. To assess the oligomeric state of adducin, physical properties of the covalently linked tetramer were determined in conjunction with those of the native uncross-linked molecule (Table1). The Stokes radius for both species was estimated by gel filtration. The native adducin peak is broad, giving an average Rs of 6.9 nm. The cross-linked adducin tetramer peak on the Superose 6 column is much sharper, giving a Stokes radius of 8.0 nm and falls within the leading edge of the uncross-linked adducin profile (Fig. 2). These data suggest that native adducin contains a mixture of dimers and tetramers either in a static state or involved in a dimer-tetramer equilibrium. The nearly quantitative formation of tetramer by cross-linking implies that during the time of the cross-linking reaction (15-30 min) essentially all dimers associate to form tetramers. Attempts were made to isolate a cross-linked dimer form of adducin but were not successful.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Molecular masses of cross-linked and native adducin were calculated to be 232 and 211 kDa, respectively, based on the Stokes radii from gel filtration and sedimentation coefficients determined by rate zonal sedimentation on sucrose gradients (Table1). The apparent molecular mass of cross-linked adducin is significantly lower than expected for a tetramer of 322 kDa and suggests an incorrect value for either the sedimentation coefficient or the Stokes radius. The most likely source of error is Stokes radius determined by gel filtration, with lower than actual values resulting from interaction of adducin with the gel matrix, or from anomalous behavior observed with other asymmetric proteins(37Nozaki Y. Schecter N.M. Reynolds J.A. Tanford C. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3884-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The tail domain of adducin is the source of aberrant behavior in SDS-electrophoresis as well as gel filtration (see below). The COOH-terminal region of both the α- and β-adducin subunits is hydrophilic and highly protease sensitive, in contrast to the stable globular NH2 terminus (Fig. 3). Due to protease sensitivity, we were unable to purify this region from limited proteolytic digests of native adducin. Therefore, COOH-terminal domains of α- and β-adducin were expressed as bacterial recombinant proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). Isolated COOH-terminal constructs migrated at an apparent 60 kDa, substantially higher than predicted molecular mass of 34 and 33 kDa based on amino acid sequence. These domains thus are likely to be responsible for anomalous migration of native adducin on SDS-gels, which migrates at an apparent molecular mass of 20 kDa higher than the actual size based on amino acid sequence. Circular dichroism indicated that COOH-terminal tail regions of α- and β-adducin are unstructured, with no evidence for α-helix or β-sheet based on signals at 208 and 222 nm, and a negative peak at 200 nm which is indicative of a random coil (Fig. 4B). Spectra of the COOH-terminal domains are in contrast to those of intact erythrocyte adducin and the NH2-terminal core region of adducin which contain approximately 10-15%α-helix as well as β-sheet secondary structure (Fig. 4A). A thermal melt was performed on both the adducin core and the α-adducin tail construct at 222 nm (Fig. 5, A and B). Loss of secondary structure in the NH2-terminal core can be seen at a midpoint of 59°C with decreasing ellipticity at 222 nm. The α-adducin tail appears to be heat stable, and the spectrum at 222 nm does not change over the temperature range of 25-71°C.Figure 5:The COOH-terminal adducin tails are extended, unstructured molecules and are heat-stable. The red cell NH2-terminal adducin core loses secondary structure cooperatively at 222 nm at 59°C, whereas the ellipticity at 222 nm does not change over the temperature range for α-adducin tail. Thermal melts were monitored at 222 nm by circular dichroism. A, erythrocyte adducin core. B, α-adducin tail.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Circular dichroism data support the idea of an unstructured COOH terminus, and the protease sensitivity of this domain implies an extended, non-globular structure. Molecular masses of 55 and 48 kDa calculated from the Stokes radii and sedimentation coefficients indicate that α- and β-adducin tails (34 kDa based on amino acid sequence) are either a mixture of monomers and dimers, or that the Stokes radius has been underestimated by gel filtration (see above) and the domains actually are dimers with a true molecular mass of 68 kDa (Table1). The frictional ratio for the tail constructs is estimated at about 1.3 using a molecular mass of 55 kDa, which was lower than expected. However a corrected molecular mass of 68 kDa yields a frictional ratio of 1.6, which is closer to the value anticipated from an extended conformation. The calculated molecular mass of 232 kDa for cross-linked adducin also is smaller than expected for a 320-kDa tetramer (see above). The globular head domain, in contrast to native adducin and COOH-terminal tail domains, behaves as expected on gel filtration and SDS-electrophoresis (22Joshi R. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13130-13136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Table1). Association of domains in the adducin molecule had not been previously ascertained. Cross-linking, proteolysis and blot-binding experiments were performed to address this question. Adducin was cross-linked and subjected to limited V8 proteolysis. A protease-resistant 160-kDa fragment was generated after 10-20 min digestion of cross-linked adducin with V8 protease, while similar digestion of uncross-linked adducin resulted in a 40-kDa polypeptide. The 160-kDa cross-linked fragment (Fig. 6, lanes 7-9) did not react with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against the COOH-terminal tail region of red cell adducin, unlike the intact tetramer (Fig. 6, lane 6). This indicated that the 160-kDa fragment contained NH2-terminal adducin sequence. The size of this fragment was the correct size for a covalently cross-linked tetramer of four NH2-terminal head domains. Sucrose gradients and gel filtration were performed in parallel on the 160-kDa cross-linked V8 fragment and the native NH2-terminal core fragment. Both displayed similar sedimentation coefficients and Stokes radii; the frictional ratio was calculated at 1.2, indicative of a globular molecule. A molecular mass of 122 kDa was calculated from hydrodynamic values for native and cross-linked head domains (Table1). As further evidence for head domain contacts, the isolated NH2-terminal fragment was able to cross-link to trimers and tetramers(22Joshi R. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13130-13136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled recombinant α- and β-adducin tail constructs were used as ligands to evaluate possible interactions with adducin and NH2- and COOH-terminal domains immobilized on nitrocellulose paper (Fig. 7, panel A). α- and β-adducin tail domains associated with tails of both subunits, as well as the intact erythrocyte adducin protein (panels B and D). This binding is specific, as evidenced by the displacement of binding when 1.3 μM unlabeled α- or β-adducin tail is included in the incubation (panels C and E). Individual subunit tails were able to form α-α, α-β, and β-β contacts. Neither the α- nor β-tails bound to the NH2-terminal core. The binding site on adducin for participation in the ternary complex of spectrin-actin-adducin was mapped to the COOH terminus of both the α- and the β-subunit based on cosedimentation assays with spectrin, F-actin, and various adducin domains (Fig. 8). Spectrin-dependent binding of 125I-labeled α- and β-adducin tails to F-actin in these experiments shows that the adducin tails bind to spectrin-actin complexes with a KD of 180 and 210 nM, respectively, about 5-6-fold lower affinity than native adducin but with a similar capacity. Hill coefficients for the α- and β-adducin tail binding data are 1.4, indicating positive cooperativity. NH2-terminal core domains were inactive in these assays. Adducin has been seen to promote the binding of spectrin to F-actin (5, Fig. 9A). Fig. 9B shows that both the α- and β-adducin tails can also stimulate binding of spectrin to actin. The double-reciprocal plot for this experiment estimated a KD of 100 nM for the red cell adducin; the adducin tails displayed a 2-3-fold lower affinity than the native adducin in this assay (KD = 270 nM). The capacity of the native adducin-dependent binding of spectrin to actin was similar to that of the recombinant adducin tail constructs (Fig. 9C). The NH2-terminal 48-kDa core-neck and 40-kDa core domain fragments did not show any activity over background (spectrin binding to actin alone) in this assay (data not shown). The extreme COOH terminus of both the α- and β-adducin subunits contains a highly polybasic region of 22 amino acids that has 41% identity to the MARCKS protein(12Joshi R. Gilligan D.M. Otto E. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 38Graff J.M. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11912-11919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MARCKS protein was also analyzed using this assay but did not show any spectrin-dependent binding to F-actin (data not shown). The polybasic region at the extreme COOH terminus of the α- and β-adducin subunits, which is similar to MARCKS, therefore is not sufficient to bind spectrin-actin complexes. This report characterizes the adducin molecule in terms of oligomeric structure, folding of domains, and definition of domains involved in contact with spectrin-actin complexes. Experiments with cross-linked and native adducin indicate that adducin in solution is a mixture of heterodimers and tetramers. Circular dichroism spectroscopy of COOH-terminal domains of α- and β-adducin expressed in bacteria provides direct evidence for an unstructured random coil configuration for the COOH-terminal region. Some predictions for a model of the adducin molecule can be made based upon the cross-linking, physical properties, proteolysis, and blot binding data (Fig. 10). Four amino-terminal head domains contact one another, eliminating a model where two antiparallel dimers come together, to form a tetramer. Exact orientation of the tails, whether two or four α-α, α-β, or β-β interactions, cannot be assessed at the level of these experiments. The flexible, extended tails would provide asymmetry to the molecule; intramolecular tail contacts may also occur. Presumably these extended, protease-sensitive tail regions are stabilized by their binding to spectrin and actin filaments. The site on adducin for binding to spectrin-actin complexes was identified as the COOH-terminal tail of both the α- and β-adducin subunits based on activities of expressed domains and lack of activity of the NH2-terminal head domain. Adducin had previously been characterized as an α/β heterodimer of 200 kDa, based upon migration on SDS-PAGE and physical properties(4Gardner K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1339-1348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Properties of cross-linked adducin tetramer and of COOH-terminal domains determined in this study provide evidence that the tail domains have anomolous behavior on gel filtration and SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis leading to underestimates of the Stokes radius of the intact molecule and overestimates of monomer molecular mass. An additional complicating factor is that adducin exists in solution as a mixture of dimers and tetramers. Adducin tetramers were inferred by previous electron microscopy studies, in which the diameter of adducin and NH2-terminal protease-resistant domains were identical and similar to predicted dimensions of a 160-kDa globular protein(12Joshi R. Gilligan D.M. Otto E. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The question of whether adducin engages in a dimer-tetramer equilibrium or exists as a static mixture of dimers and tetramers needs to be addressed in future experiments. Adducin binds Ca2+/calmodulin and accepts phosphate from protein kinases A and C. Ca2+/calmodulin does not affect the profile of native adducin on gel filtration (data not shown). However, the effects of phosphorylation on the oligomeric state of adducin have yet to be tested. Although adducin in erythrocytes contains α- and β-subunits in a 1:1 ratio, only α-adducin has been detected in keratinocytes (18Kaiser H.W. O'Keefe E. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and fibroblasts(39Waseem A. Cho K. Palfrey H.C. FASEB J. 1988; 2: A349Google Scholar). It is pertinent in this regard that the site for adducin binding to spectrin-actin complexes has been mapped to the COOH-terminal region of both α- and β-subunits, and that both α- and β-COOH-terminal domains can self-associate (Fig. 7). Individual subunits should therefore be capable of interacting with spectrin-actin complexes and at least of forming homodimers. It will be of interest to determine if assembly of adducin subunits to tetramers requires both α- and β-subunits and to evaluate activities of α-adducin in the absence of β-adducin. The COOH-terminal domain of adducin, although unstructured, is an essential portion of the molecule. Activities in addition to spectrin-actin binding, recruitment of additional spectrin molecules to F-actin, and self-association include the site for Ca2+/calmodulin binding on β-adducin(40Scaramuzzino D.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3398-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and a binding site for stomatin (band 7.2b)(41Sinard J.H. Stewart G.H. Argent A.C. Morrow J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (abstr.): 421Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domain also is likely to contribute to functional diversity among adducin isoforms, since alternatively spliced variants have conserved NH2-terminal sequences and variable COOH termini(13Taylor S.A.M. Snell R.G. Buckler A. Ambrose C. Duyao M. Church D. Lin C.S. Altherr M. Bates G.P. Groot N. Barnes G. Shaw D.J. Lehrach H. Wasmuth J.J. Harper P.S. Housman D.E. MacDonald M.E. Gusella J.

The NH2-terminal head domain, in contrast, is the most conserved region of adducin but has no known role other than its role in stabilizing the adducin tetramer. Determining the function(s) of the NH2-terminal domain will be an interesting challenge for the future. We thank Diana Gilligan for the full-length α- and β-adducin cDNA clones."

Using human/mouse LFA-1 α subunit chimeras, we mapped regions required for binding to ICAM-1 N-terminal to amino acid (aa) residue 359. Ligand binding sites were mapped in greater detail by scanning this region with murine sequences from 56 down to 17 aa in length and finally by introducing single or few murine aa residue replacements into the human sequence. Replacement of two non-contiguous regions of aa residues 119-153 and 218-248 in the I domain with the corresponding mouse sequences abolished most binding to human ICAM-1, without affecting αβ subunit association or expression on the surface of transfected COS cells. Specific residues within the I domain found to be important were Met-140, Glu-146, Thr-243, and Ser-245. Using the recently solved structure of the Mac-1 (CD11b) I domain as a model (Lee, J.-O., Rieu, P., Arnaout, M. A., and Liddington, R.(1995) Cell 80, 631-638), these residues are shown to be located on the surface of the I domain surrounding the site to which Mg2+ is chelated, and define a ligand binding interface. Mapping of the epitopes of a panel of mouse anti-human and rat anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies gave concordant results. Epitopes were mapped to two different regions in the N-terminal domain, four regions within the I domain, and two regions between the I domain and the EF hand-like repeats. Monoclonal antibodies to epitopes within the mid- to C-terminal portion of the I domain and the N-terminal portion of the region between the I domain and the EF hand-like repeats gave good inhibition of LFA-1-dependent homotypic aggregation with cells that express either ICAM-1 or ICAM-3 as the major LFA-1 ligand.

The lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1, 1The abbreviations used are: LFAlymphocyte function-associated antigen-1ICAMintercellular adhesion moleculeIgSFIg superfamilyMIDASmetal ion-dependent adhesion siteVLAvery late antigenmAbmonoclonal antibodykbkilobase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reaction. CD11a/CD18) was initially identified with mAb because of its importance in antigen-specific T lymphocyte interactions (28Larson R.S. Corbi A.L. Berman L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Subsequently, LFA-1 was shown to be important in a wide variety of lymphocyte functions and to be required for interactions with vascular endothelium in immigration of lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils in inflammation and homing and recirculation of lymphocytes (46Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (5860) Google Scholar, 47Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar, 48Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 827-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). LFA-1 is an integrin αβ heterodimer. Two other integrins restricted in expression to leukocytes, Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) and p150,95 (CD11c/CD18) (44Sanchez-Madrid F. Nagy J. Robbins E. Simon P. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), share the same CD18 or β2 integrin subunit and have homologous α subunits. LFA-1 binds to three counter-receptors, ICAM-1, ICAM-2, and ICAM-3, that are members of the Ig superfamily (IgSF) and have distinctive patterns of surface expression and in the aggregate are constitutively or inducibly expressed on almost all cells in the body (48Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 827-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). Binding of LFA-1 to ICAMs is Mg2+-dependent (31Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). Although LFA-1 is constitutively expressed on most leukocytes, binding to its counter-receptors requires cellular activation, which is thought to induce conformational changes in LFA-1 that affect its affinity for ligand and interaction with the cytoskeleton (12Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 506-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 intercellular adhesion molecule Ig superfamily metal ion-dependent adhesion site very late antigen monoclonal antibody kilobase pair(s) polymerase chain reaction. Structure-function studies on LFA-1 are crucial for mapping ligand binding sites and determining the molecular basis for the interaction with ICAMs and the activation of adhesiveness of LFA-1. The LFA-1 α subunit, αL, has two prominent structural features, an inserted or I domain of about 200 aa residues present in some but not most integrins, and three EF hand-like putative divalent cation binding repeats that are shared with all other integrin α subunits (17Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). The I domain is homologous to motifs in other proteins including the three A domains of von Willebrand factor, which have been implicated in ligand binding, multiple repeats in cartilage matrix protein and collagen type VI, and single repeats in complement component C2 and factor B (6Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Blood. 1991; 77: 2305-2315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mac-1 and p150,95 α subunit chimeras were previously used to map epitopes of function-blocking mAb to Mac-1 and thus to map a site important for binding of the ligands iC3b, fibrinogen, and ICAM-1 to the I domain of Mac-1 (13Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbi A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Subsequently, multiple studies on Mac-1 (30Lee J.-O. Rieu P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have implicated the I domain in ligand binding. Very recently, the three-dimensional structure of the Mac-1 I domain has been determined (30Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). It has a double-twisted fold, with a central hydrophobic β-sheet surrounded by amphipathic α-helices. A single Mg2+ ion is bound to residues in three connecting loops at what will be referred to as the top of the I domain, above one end of the central β-sheet. The Mg2+ is coordinated by the hydroxyls of Thr-209, Ser-142, and Ser-144, and by 2 water molecules. Asp-140 and Asp-242 are in an outer sphere of coordination and coordinate with a water molecule and Ser-142 and Ser-144 that directly coordinate Mg2+. Asp-140 and Asp-242 are buried beneath the Mg2+, and unavailable for contact with ligand. This structural motif has been called a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS). In the crystal structure, the Mg2+ forms an adventitious coordination with a Glu residue from a neighboring I domain. In ICAM-1, Glu-34 in IgSF domain 1 is the most important residue for binding to LFA-1 (50Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) and might form an analogous coordination with Mg2+. Mutation of residues that form the primary or secondary coordination shell with the Mg2+ ion, including Asp-140 and Asp-242 in the I domain of Mac-1 (30Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar; 32Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), their homologues in the I domain of VLA-2 (21Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and VLA-1 (24Kern A. Briesewitz R. Bank I. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22811-22816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the homologue of Thr-209 in the I domain of VLA-2 (21Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), disrupt ligand binding. Such mutations abolish divalent cation binding in Mac-1 (32Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and are predicted to do the same in the α1 and α2 subunits, suggesting that the divalent cation may indirectly stabilize a ligand binding site, or that the cation may directly coordinate with ligand. Other residues required for ligand binding and that are likely to form direct contacts with ligand have yet to be identified in any integrin I domain. In this study, we have utilized chimeric LFA-1 α subunits in intact heterodimers expressed on the cell surface to define in detail structural regions of the LFA-1 α subunit that are important for binding to ICAM-1. Our studies were made possible by a previous observation that human but not mouse LFA-1 would bind to human ICAM-1, and that this species specificity mapped to the LFA-1 α subunit (18Johnston S.C. Dustin M.L. Hibbs M.L. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1181-1187PubMed Google Scholar). The human and murine LFA-1 α subunits have 72% amino acid sequence identity (22Kaufman Y. Tseng E. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 369-371PubMed Google Scholar), allowing interspecies chimeric subunits to be constructed with little disruption of conformation. The chimeras have been used to map residues required for binding of LFA-1 to ICAM-1, and also to map epitopes for a panel of 20 mAb and to correlate epitope location with inhibition of binding to ICAMs. We demonstrate that four specific amino acid residues in two noncontiguous regions of the I domain, aa residues 119-153 and 218-248, are crucial for binding to ICAM-1. These residues surround the Mg2+ ion on the top of the I domain, and define a ligand-binding interface. mAbs that block binding to ICAM-1 and ICAM-3 map to epitopes within or adjacent to these regions. COS-7 cells, Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell line, JY, and the T cell line, SKW3, were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

The human LFA-1α cDNA in pSP65 (29Larson R.S. Hibbs M.L. Springer T.A. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was excised with HindIII and SphI and cloned into the polylinker of pUC19. It was excised with XbaI and cloned into the XbaI site of AprM8, a derivative of CDM8 containing the β-lactamase gene from pBluescript. 2L. B. Klickstein, unpublished data. The murine LFA-1α cDNA (22Kaufman Y. Tseng E. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 369-371PubMed Google Scholar) and human β cDNA (25Kishimoto T.K. O'Connor K. Lee A. Roberts T.M. Springer T.A. Cell. 1987; 48: 681-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) were in AprM8. Chimeric α subunits with exchanges at BspHI (aa residue 153), Sse8387I (aa residue 359), and MscI (aa residue 654) sites occurring in both the human and murine cDNA were prepared by restriction enzyme digestion, purification of fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis, and ligation (see Fig. 1A). Chimeras or scanning mutants were named according to the species origin of their segments. For example, h153m359h indicates that residues 1-153 are from hαL, residues 154-359 are from mαL, and residues 360 to the C terminus are from hαL. Amino acid sequence numbering was according to the human sequence (29Larson R.S. Hibbs M.L. Springer T.A. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Chimeras h654m and m654h were constructed by ligation of 7.3- or 6.8-kb fragments from partial MscI and complete HindIII digestion of hαL or mαL, respectively, and 2.1-kb fragments from complete MscI and HindIII digestion of mαL or hαL cDNA, respectively. Chimera h359m was constructed by ligation of a 8.2-kb fragment from complete HindIII and partial Sse8387I digestion of hαL cDNA and a 1.2-kb fragment from complete HindIII and Sse8387I digestion of mαL cDNA. m153h359m was constructed with a 0.6-kb fragment from complete HindIII and BspHI digestion of mαL and a 8.3-kb fragment from complete HindIII and partial digestion with BspHI of h359m. h153m359h was constructed in two steps. A 0.6-kb fragment from complete digestion of hαL with HindIII and BspHI was ligated to a 8.3-kb fragment from complete HindIII and partial BspHI digestion of mαL to generate h153m. Then a 1.2-kb fragment from complete HindIII and Sse8387I digestion of h153m was ligated with a 8.2-kb fragment from complete HindIII and partial Sse8387I digestion of hαL to make h153m359h. The region from the N terminus to the N-terminal end of the EF hand-like repeats was scanned by insertion of short segments of mouse sequence into the human αL subunit (Fig. 2A). To make scanning mutants h217m248h, h249m303h, and h300m442h, we took advantage of unique NruI, ClaI, and SalI restriction sites and two adjacent BglII sites at residues 300 and 303 in hαL. None of these sites were present at the same position in mαL; therefore, oligonucleotides containing these sites were used to amplify with PCR the corresponding mouse sequences. PCR fragments were restriction digested and NruI-ClaI, ClaI-BglII, or BglII-SalI fragments were ligated to hαL cut with the same enzymes to construct h217m248h, h249m303h, and h300m442h, respectively. A PCR fragment amplified from m359h was digested with BglII-SalI and ligated into hαL cut with the same enzymes to construct h300m359h (Fig. 2A). Other scanning mutants were constructed with the PCR overlap extension technique (16Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Two successive PCR were used to generate a chimeric fragment, which was then restriction digested and inserted in hαL. A silent substitution in the sequence of the overlap oligonucleotide was frequently used to introduce a restriction site at or nearby the mouse-human junction. These sites were used diagnostically and in some cases for construction of subsequent scanning mutants. In the first PCR, two separate reactions were performed to generate one fragment from hαL and a neighboring fragment from mαL. The two oligonucleotide primers at the overlap region were complementary for at least 18 bases (Table1). The two PCR reactions used 5′ upstream and 3′ complementary primers, and 5′ complementary and 3′ downstream primers, respectively. Restriction sites that were unique in αL or the vector were included in the 5′ upstream and 3′ downstream primers. The products of each PCR reaction were separated on an agarose gel, and bands of correct size were purified using Promega's PCR DNA preparation system (Promega). One tenth of the purified DNA samples were mixed and served as templates for the second PCR reaction, with the 5′ upstream and 3′ downstream primers of the previous two PCR reactions. The PCR products were digested with the proper restriction enzymes and ligated into the hαL cDNA fragment in AprM8 produced by digestion with the same enzymes. Scanning mutants m57h, h57m74h, h74m93h, and h93m117h (Fig. 2A) were transferred into αL using HindIII and KasI sites. The h57m117h construct was used as an intermediate in construction of h93m117h and h57m93h. The h57m93h construct was used as an intermediate in construction of h57m74h and h74m93h. The sequence of all these mutants was confirmed from the HindIII to KasI site by dideoxysequencing using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) according to manufacturer's instructions. Scanning mutants h118m153h, h153m183h, and h185m215h (Fig. 2A) were transferred into αL using unique KasI and ClaI sites. The h118m215h construct was used as an intermediate in construction of h153m215h, which in turn was used in construction of h153m183h and h184m215h. The sequence of all these mutants was confirmed from the KasI to ClaI sites.TABLE I Open table in a new tab PCR amplification with primers that encompassed the KasI or ClaI sites and encoded mutations near these sites was used to generate the F122Y, I126M, L224S, T243S, and S245K mutants (Table1). The PCR products were digested with KasI and ClaI and ligated into hαL digested with the same enzymes. PCR overlap extension was used to produce mutants N129K, M140Q, Q143D, P144R, D145K, E146K, Q148E, D152E, I231V, E218H/R221K/L224S, and I235V/T243S/S245K. The 5′ upstream and 3′ downstream primers encompassed the KasI and ClaI sites, respectively, and these enzymes were used to move the PCR fragments into hαL as described above for scanning mutants. The entire KasI-ClaI fragment was sequenced for each mutant. Plasmids were purified with a Wizard Maxi preparation kit (Promega) and ethanol precipitation. COS cells were transiently cotransfected with wild type, mutant, or chimeric LFA-1 α subunits and human β2 subunit constructs using DEAE-Dextran (1Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8573-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were treated with trypsin-EDTA on day 2 and replated. On day 3, cells were harvested in 5 mM EDTA/phosphate-buffered saline and washed with L15 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum. Immunofluorescence flow cytometry was as described previously (15Hibbs M.L. Wardlaw A.J. Stacker S.A. Anderson D.C. Lee A. Roberts T.M. Springer T.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), with a first incubation of 10 μg/ml purified mAb or 1:200 dilution of ascites and staining with 1:20 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody. A soluble form of human ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) truncated before the transmembrane domain (Y452E/F*) was expressed in SF9 insect cells and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography (4Casasnovas J.M. Reed R.R. Springer T.A. Methods. 1994; 6: 157-167Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Transfected COS cells were labeled with 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and −6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester and assayed for binding to purified ICAM-1 absorbed to 96-well plates with a fluorimeter as described (3Bilsland C.A.G. Springer T.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), except binding was for 25 min at 37°C and washing was with a 26-gauge 5/8-inch needle. Binding of transfected cells to ICAM-1 was expressed as a percent of wild type = 100 × (mutant - mock binding)/(wild type - mock binding). Triplicates in each experiment were averaged and considered a single data point for calculation of S.D. among different experiments. JY or SKW3 cells were harvested near confluence (about 6 × 105 cells/ml). Cells (2 × 106/ml) preincubated with 1:200 ascites or 10 μg/ml purified protein for 20 min were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml in 100 μl in microtiter plates gently shaken for 30 min for JY cells or 2 h for SKW3 cells at 37°C, as described previously (41Rothlein R. Dustin M.L. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1270-1274PubMed Google Scholar), except with 5% fetal bovine serum. To localize sites on the human LFA-1 α subunit cognate for human ICAM-1, a set of five human/mouse α subunit chimeras were constructed in the expression vector AprM8 (Fig. 1A). These chimeras swapped the N-terminal region, I domain, metal binding domain, and the remaining C-terminal portion between the human and mouse α chains. Chimeras and scanning mutants (see below) were named according to the species origin of their segments, e.g. h153m359h is an α subunit with human aa residues 1-152, mouse residues 153-358, and human residues 359 to C terminus. COS cells were cotransfected with the chimeric α subunits and the wild-type human β2 subunit. To test for association of the α subunit chimeras with the β2 subunit and expression on the cell surface, the transfected COS cells were stained with anti-αL mAb and anti-β2 mAb TS1/18 and subjected to flow cytometry. Association between α and β subunits is required for efficient surface expression of the LFA-1 α and β subunits (29Larson R.S. Hibbs M.L. Springer T.A. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar; 29Larson R.S. Hibbs M.L. Springer T.A. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); as shown by stimulation of β subunit expression, all five α subunit chimeras associated with the β2 subunit and were expressed on the COS cell surface comparably to wild type human and murine α subunits (Fig. 1B). The overall conformation of the chimeric α subunits on the cell surface was intact, because they reacted with a variety of antibodies to different epitopes on the α subunits (see below, Fig. 5A). The molecular size of the chimeric α subunits was the same as human or mouse α as shown by 125I labeling of COS cell transfectants and immunoprecipitation with both anti-α and anti-β mAbs (data not shown). The functional activity of LFA-1 was tested by measuring binding of transfected COS cells to soluble ICAM-1 absorbed on plastic microtiter wells (Fig. 1B). COS cells cotransfected with hαL and β2 subunit cDNAs bound to human ICAM-1, whereas COS cells that were mock-transfected or transfected with the β2 subunit alone did not bind. By contrast, COS cells cotransfected with the mouse αL and human β2 subunit cDNAs did not bind human ICAM-1, confirming previous results (18Johnston S.C. Dustin M.L. Hibbs M.L. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1181-1187PubMed Google Scholar; 22Kaufman Y. Tseng E. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 369-371PubMed Google Scholar). The h654m chimera bound to ICAM-1 as well as human LFA-1 (Fig. 1B), whereas the reciprocal chimera m654h did not bind to ICAM-1, suggesting that the region controlling the species specificity is located N-terminal to the MscI site. The SseI site at residue 359 is intermediate between the I domain and the EF hand-like repeats (Fig. 1A). The chimera h359m bound to ICAM-1 as well as human LFA-1, further mapping the species specificity of binding N-terminal to the SseI site. The reciprocal chimera m359h was not expressed on the cell surface (data not shown). The BspHI site at residue 153 is in the I domain (Fig. 1A). Chimeras in which the segment between aa residues 153 and 359 was exchanged, h153m359h and m153h359m, showed binding to ICAM-1 that was less than for human αL, but greater than for mouse αL or m654h. Taken together with the finding that h359m had full activity, these results suggested that both the aa residue 1-153 and 154-359 segments contributed to binding to ICAM-1. To map binding sites in more detail, the region from residues 1 to 442 was scanned by replacing short segments of human sequence with the corresponding mouse sequence (Fig. 2A). The expression of each mutant in COS cells was determined by flow cytometry using mAb to the β2 subunit (Fig. 2B) and to the αL subunit (see Fig. 5B below), and compared to binding of each mutant to purified ICAM-1 (Fig. 2B). The region from the N terminus to the beginning of the I domain (residues 1-117) was scanned with four different mutants. Replacements with larger segments of mouse sequence in this region (1-117, 57-117, 57-93), which is 71% identical with human, resulted in chimeras that were not expressed (not shown). Replacements with the four smaller segments resulted in chimeras that were expressed, but not always as well as wild-type. Scanning mutant m57h was consistently expressed at about 60% the level of human αL, and bound about 35% as well, consistent either with a contribution to binding or an altered conformation. Scanning mutants h57m74h and h74m93h gave expression and binding to ICAM-1 that were concordant and were slightly depressed relative to wild-type. Binding and expression of h93m117h was not significantly different from human LFA-1. The I domain was scanned with five different mutants, from residues 118-303. All five scanning mutants were expressed in COS cells as well as wild-type mouse and human LFA-1 (Fig. 2B). Scanning mutant h118m153h bound only 30% as well as human LFA-1 to ICAM-1, despite a difference of only 11 amino acids between mouse and human over the 28-aa residue segment that was exchanged. Mutants h153m183h and h184m215h showed only a slight and nonsignificant reduction in binding activity. By contrast, scanning mutant h217m248h was dramatically deficient in binding to ICAM-1. The 30 amino acid residues exchanged in this region contained only six differences between mouse and human. Exchange of the final segment of the I domain in chimera h249m303h had no effect on binding to ICAM-1. The region between the I domain and the first EF hand-like p"

Immunofluorescence microscopy with a monospecific monoclonal antibody against NUP159 gave the punctate nuclear rim staining characteristic of nucleoporins. Immunogold electron microscopy with isolated yeast NEs yielded decoration of only the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex. The gene encoding NUP159 is essential, and, like some other nucleoporins, NUP159 contains a coiled-coil domain as well as a domain of repeated motifs. Five segments of NUP159, covering its entire length, were expressed in Escherichia coli. The repeat motif-containing segment was found to bind a nuclear transport substrate in the presence of vertebrate cytosolic extract containing nuclear transport factors. This segment also bound 35S-labeled mammalian karyopherin β, one such transport factor that mediates the docking of substrates to the nuclear pore complex. These data establish a direct biochemical link between the repeat motif domain of a yeast nucleoporin, transport factors, (specifically karyopherin β), and nuclear transport substrates. Its cytoplasmic aspect implies a role for NUP159 in nuclear import. We have identified a new yeast nucleoporin of 159 kDa that we term NUP159.

It has been proposed that the repeat motif-containing nucleoporins form a stationary phase of multiple docking sites that extend from the cytoplasmic to the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC (6Radu A.

Although there are also numerous repeat motif nucleoporins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (for review see (17Rout M.P. Wente S.R.

Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)), a biochemical connection to soluble transport factors has so far not been established. Furthermore, although some vertebrate nucleoporins (including a few that contain repeat motifs) have been localized to substructures of the NPC (for review see (17Rout M.P. Wente S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 357-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and (18Fabre E. Hurt E.C. Curr. Opin.

Here we report the identification of a new yeast nucleoporin of 159 kDa, termed NUP159. By immunoelectron microscopy, we sublocalized NUP159 to the cytoplasmic side of the NPC. NUP159 contains numerous short peptide repeats, similar to those found in other nucleoporins. We have expressed five segments of NUP159, covering its entire length, in Escherichia coli and shown that only the repeat motif-containing segment of NUP159 serves in mammalian transport factor-mediated binding of import substrate. Highly enriched NPCs were fractionated and prepared for peptide sequencing as described(13Pemberton L.F. Rout M.P. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two PCR products of NUP159 (A and B) were obtained by PCR with genomic DNA from S. cerevisiae (Promega, Madison, WI) as a template. PCR product A contained the upstream flanking region with 339 base pairs of non-coding and 60 base pairs of coding sequence of NUP159. The primers contained additional engineered SacII and XbaI restriction sites. The second PCR product (B) contained a 423-base pair flanking region downstream and additional BamHI and SmaI linkers. For the LEU2 marker we digested plasmid pJJ252 (23Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) with XbaI and BamHI. PCR product A, the LEU2 marker, and PCR product B were sequentially cloned into pBluescript II. The whole construct (PCR product A, LEU2 marker, and PCR product B) was linearized by digestion with SacII and SmaI, introduced into the diploid strain DF5, and Leu+ transformants were selected. Targeted integration was verified by Southern blot. Sporulation and dissection of the resulting strain were as described(24Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991Google Scholar). Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with the primary antibodies as described(25Kraemer D. Wozniak R.W. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG (1:3000), labeling was detected with the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). NUP159 was divided into five fragments (p159-1, amino acid residues 1-175; p159-2, residues 176-440; p159-3, residues 441-876; p159-4, residues 877-1222; p159-5, residues 1223-1460), and each corresponding DNA segment was cloned by PCR and inserted between the EcoRI and NotI sites of the pET21-b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) containing a tag of six histidines. The constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). All proteins were expressed in inclusion bodies except for p159-3, which was found as a soluble product in the cytosol (Novagen, pET manual). The preparation of spheroplasts and nuclei (26Rout M.P. Kilmartin J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1913-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) was modified by adding chymostatin, antipain, leupeptin (2.5 μg/ml each), and a protinin (15-30 microunits/ml) (Sigma) as additional protease inhibitors. Yeast NEs were prepared from the protease-deficient strain cl3-ABYS-86 as described (modification of a previous method (27Kilmartin J.V. Fogg J. Cappuccinelli P. Morris N.R.

The primary antibody was detected with Cy3-labeled polyclonal donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). NEs were centrifuged onto the bottom of a well of a microtiter plate(26Rout M.P. Kilmartin J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1913-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 31Wray B.E. Sealock R.

After another wash with bt-Me2SO, the wells were incubated for 5 min at 25°C in 1 mM glycine in bt-Me2SO and preblocked for 5 min in IEM buffer (IEM buffer = 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 × phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 90 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2.5 μg/ml chymostatin, 2.5 μg/ml antipain, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 30 microunits/ml aprotinin). All subsequent washes and incubations were performed in IEM buffer. Tissue culture supernatant from the monoclonal cell line mAb 165C10 was diluted 1:3 with IEM buffer, added to the wells, and incubated for 1 h at 25°C. The wells were washed four times, and a 1:10 dilution of 10-nm gold-labeled affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) was added and incubated for 1 h at 25°C. The wells were washed again as above, then washed twice in 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 1 mM MgCl2, and fixed for 12 h at 4°C with 2.5% glutaraldehyde.

Microsequencing of a ~50-kDa polypeptide present in the highly enriched NPC fraction of yeast (19Rout M.P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) yielded a peptide sequence that was identical to residues 1106-1118 (Fig. 1) of an uncharacterized ORF YIL115C (EMBL/GenBankTM/DDBJ accession number Z38125) located on chromosome IX of S. cerevisiae. The ORF is predicted to code for a protein of 1460 amino acids and a Mr of 158,923. As this protein is a nucleoporin (see below) we have termed it NUP159, consistent with conventional nomenclature(28Davis L.I. Blobel G. Cell. 1986; 45: 699-709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 30Wente S.R. Rout M.P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 705-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To investigate if this gene is essential for cell growth, we transformed a linearized fragment containing a LEU2-marked deletion allele into a diploid strain to replace one copy by homologous recombination. Leu+ transformants were verified by Southern analysis and sporulated, and the tetrads were dissected. All tetrads yielded only two viable segregants, both of which were Leu−, suggesting that the NUP159Δ::LEU2 segregants were not viable (Fig. 2). As with many nucleoporins, NUP159 contains a region with repeated motifs (Fig. 1) including the XFXFG motif found in several other nucleoporins (for review see (17Rout M.P. Wente S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 357-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and (18Fabre E. Hurt E.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)) as well as three additional related repeat motifs, namely PSFG, PASG, and SAFG (Fig. 1). A computer homology search revealed that the motifs PSFG and SAFG were also found in another uncharacterized yeast ORF of 430 amino acids (GenPept accession number Z48784, ORF 9346.04c). NUP159 is 65% similar to this potential yeast nucleoporin across 20% of its length and 56% similar to Nup214 across 19% of its length(25Kraemer D. Wozniak R.W. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 33Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.M. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). NUP159 is rich in serines (14%) and in potential phosphorylation sites. NUP159 also contains a potential coiled-coil domain (34Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2), which may be involved in homo- or heterodimerization, a feature found in some other nucleoporins (for review see (17Rout M.P. Wente S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 357-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and (18Fabre E. Hurt E.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)). For further analysis, we expressed five segments, p159-1 to p159-5, covering the entire length of NUP159 in E. coli (Fig. 2 and 3A, a). Segment 3 contains the repeat motifs, and the C-terminal segment 5 contains the potential coiled-coil domain of NUP159. We screened a panel of monoclonal antibodies that had been obtained by immunization of mice with NEs. One of these monoclonal antibodies (mAb 165C10) reacted with NUP159, specifically with the expressed segment p159-4 (residues 877-1222) (Fig. 3A, c). This segment contains none of the repeat motifs. In contrast, the polyspecific mAb 414 recognized the repeat motif domain (segment 3) (Fig. 3A, b). mAb 165C10 reacted with a single polypeptide of 190 kDa in a whole yeast spheroplast lysate or in yeast nuclei (Fig. 3B), indicating that the mAb is monospecific for Nup159. During the preparation of NPCs and NEs, NUP159 appeared to be extraordinarily protease-sensitive. One breakdown product appeared to be the ~50-kDa polypeptide from which the peptide sequence data were derived. For this reason we used the haploid protease-deficient strain cl3-ABYS-86. Fractions from spheroplasts to NEs were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. NUP159, detected with the monoclonal antibody, cofractionated absolutely with the NEs (data not shown). We used mAb 165C10 to localize NUP159. Formaldehyde-fixed yeast spheroplasts were incubated with the mAb for immunofluorescence microscopy, and a nucleoporin-characteristic punctate nuclear rim staining was observed (Fig. 4). For immunoelectron microscopy, isolated NEs were incubated with mAb 165C10, and the labeling was visualized with gold-labeled secondary antibodies. By using this pre-embedding immunolabeling technique in yeast, it was possible to sublocalize NUP159 with greater accuracy than post-embedding labeling methods (Fig. 5). All of the 196 gold particles in the micrographs that could be unequivocally assigned to NPCs were found exclusively on their cytoplasmic side. In the cases of NPCs clearly sectioned perpendicular to their midplane (and hence to midplane of the NE), the shortest distance from the center of each gold particle to the midplane was measured, and the average of these measurements was 41 ± 15 nm (n = 41) (Fig. 5). Another nucleoporin was localized with this technique to both sides of the NPC (data not shown); hence the lack of signal on the nuclear face of the NPC is not a result of general inaccessibility of this face. NPCs were often multiply labeled, with as many as seven gold particles each. Mammalian repeat motif-containing nucleoporins have been shown to bind transport substrate in a reaction mediated by cytosolic subfraction A (6Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1769-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 32Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). For one of these nucleoporins, Nup98, the binding site has been mapped to its repeat motif-containing domain(15Radu A. Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 81: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The active component of fraction A in nuclear import has been shown to be the heterodimeric karyopherin(6Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1769-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 7Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1995; 81: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Further analysis has revealed that binding to the repeat motif-containing nucleoporins is via the β subunit of karyopherin(10Moroianu J. Hijikata M. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic exposure of NUP159, a repeat motif nucleoporin, makes it a candidate for such import-related binding. To test whether the repeat motif segment 3 of NUP159 also functions as a docking site, the five E. coli-expressed segments of NUP159 were incubated with a transport substrate and Xenopus ovary cytosolic subfraction A(32Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Only the peptide repeat-containing segment 3 of NUP159 bound transport substrate in a fraction A-dependent fashion (Fig. 6A; for controls see Fig. 6B). Likewise, 35S-labeled recombinant rat karyopherin β bound exclusively to the repeat motif segment 3 of NUP159 (Fig. 6C). NUP159 is the first of the yeast nucleoporins that has so far been sublocalized. Given the uncertainties associated with secondary immunolabeling, the epitope may be between 30 and 50 nm from the central plane of the NPC. We therefore expect NUP159 to project some distance into the cytoplasm. This suggests that NUP159 may be a component of the short cytoplasmic fibers that emanate from the NPC (35Richardson W.D. Mills A.D. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1988; 52: 655-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Diffuse structures of 20-30 nm attached to the NPC have been shown in section electron micrographs of pelleted yeast nuclei that could be collapsed fibers(19Rout M.P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In vertebrate cells, three nucleoporins have so far been sublocalized to these fibers: Nup358(16Wu J. Matunis M.J. Kraemer D. Blobel G. Coutavas E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14209-14213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), Nup214 (25Kraemer D. Wozniak R.W. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and Tpr(11Byrd D.A. Sweet D.J. Panté N. Konstantinov K.N. Guan T. Saphire A.C.S. Mitchell P.J. Cooper C.S. Aebi U. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1515-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Of these, Nup358 and Nup214 are repeat motif-containing nucleoporins. Because of the sequence similarities of NUP159 and Nup214 and because of their similar locations, the repeat module of yeast NUP159 could be functionally homologous to that of mammalian Nup214. Besides the XFXFG repeats that are also shared by some other nucleoporins (for review see Refs. 17 and 18), NUP159 contains the repeat motifs PSFG, PASG, and SAFG. The motifs PSFG and SAFG were found also in another potential yeast nucleoporin. Motif SAFG is especially similar to the motif SVFG in Nup214(25Kraemer D. Wozniak R.W. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). All of these repeats are located in a central domain (segment 3) of NUP159. The ability of the NUP159 repeat motif domain to bind transport substrate in a karyopherin-dependent fashion in an overlay assay is similar to that recently demonstrated for the repeat domain in rat Nup98(15Radu A. Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 81: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that there is a functional conservation of NPC transport components amongst the eukaryotes, because Xenopus karyopherin or rat karyopherin β were both able to interact with the repeat motif domain of a yeast nucleoporin. It is likely that the repeat motif domains of other yeast nucleoporins will also form an array of multiple docking sites across the NPC(6Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1769-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 15Radu A. Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 81: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar).

This study used J774A.1 cells to characterize the “burst” of sphinganine and sphingosine, or the transient increase of up to 10-fold in long-chain base mass, that occurs when cells in culture are changed to fresh medium. The increase in sphinganine was attributable to de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis because: 1) there is increased incorporation of [3H]serine and [3H]palmitate into sphinganine; 2) the incorporation of [3H]serine was equivalent to the increase in sphinganine mass; 3) β-F-alanine, an inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase, blocked the sphinganine burst; 4) the magnitude of the burst depended on the concentration of serine in the medium, which is known to affect long-chain base biosynthesis; and 5) the appearance of sphinganine was relatively unaffected by lyso-osmotrophic agents (NH4Cl and chloroquine) that blocked sphingolipid hydrolysis in these cells. In contrast, the sphingosine burst arose mainly from turnover of complex sphingolipids because no incorporation of [3H]serine or [3H]palmitate into sphingosine was detected; sphingosine mass was not affected by β-F-alanine or the serine concentration; and, the burst could be followed by the release of sphingosine and ceramide from complex sphingolipids (especially sphingomyelin) in a process that was inhibited by NH4Cl and chloroquine. Additionally, the fate of these long-chain bases differed: sphinganine was mostly (80-85%) acylated and incorporated into dihydroceramide and complex sphingolipids, whereas most of the sphingosine (70%) was phosphorylated and degraded, with incorporation of the resulting ethanolamine phosphate into phosphatidylethanolamine. Sphinganine, however, could be diverted toward degradation by adding an inhibitor of N-acylation (fumonisin B1). In accounting for the elevation in sphingosine and sphinganine after cells are changed to new medium, these studies have provided fundamental information about long-chain base metabolism. The existence of differential changes in sphinganine and sphingosine, as well as their 1-phosphates and N-acyl-derivatives, should be considered when evaluating the roles of sphingolipid metabolites in cell regulation.

After precipitating collagen types II, XI, and IX at 0.7 M, 1.2 M and 2.0 M NaCl, the supernatant was adjusted to 4.0 M NaCl, conditions which precipitated the N-propeptides of type XI collagen. Collagen α-chains were isolated by elution from an agarose A5m molecular sieve column (170 × 1.5 cm, 200-400 mesh, Bio-Rad) in 2 M guanidine HCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Type IX collagen degradation products that coeluted with the type XI α-chains were removed by rechromatography on the same column after reduction and carboxymethylation of cysteine residues. Individual α-chains of type XI collagen were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC (C8 column, Brownlee Aquapore RP-300, 4.6 mm × 25 cm) using a linear gradient (23-32%) of acetonitrile:n-propanol (3:1, v/v) in aqueous 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at 1 ml/min over 40 min, monitoring 220 nm absorbance. Aliquots (100 μl) of collected fractions were assayed for 3H activity by scintillation spectrometry. Peptides containing pyridinoline cross-linking residues were detected by monitoring for fluorescence (excitation, 297 nm; emission, >380 nm) using a Kratos model 970 HPLC fluorescence detector(19Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1850-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides containing 3H-labeled cross-links were purified by ion-exchange and reverse-phase HPLC. The N-propeptide collagenous extensions of type XI collagen were purified by sieving on a polyacrylamide P60 column (1.0 × 50 cm, <400 mesh, Bio-Rad), eluted with 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, followed by reverse-phase HPLC. Purified α-chains containing 3H-labeled cross-links were reacted with sodium metaperiodate (NaIO4) to cleave the borohydride-reduced ketoamine cross-links(28Eyre D.R. Glimcher M.J. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After cleavage, the tritium remains with the residue, hydroxynorvaline, which is derived from the hydroxylysine aldehyde donor of the cross-link in the telopeptide sequence. The resulting tritiated telopeptides were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC and structurally identified by protein microsequencing. Purified type II and XI α-chains were dissolved in 0.2 M NH4HCO3 at 2 mg/ml, heat denatured to 70°C for 10 min, and digested with trypsin (1:50 w/w, Boehringer Mannheim sequencing grade) for 4 h at 37°C. Digests were acidified with acetic acid and freeze dried. Collagen fractions were routinely examined by SDS-PAGE(29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205155) Google Scholar). For amino-terminal microsequencing, protein bands were transblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Westran, Schleicher & Schuell) using a MilliBlot-SDE electroblotting apparatus(25Wu J.J. Woods P.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23007-23014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were subjected to amino-terminal sequencing on a Porton 2090E gas-phase sequencer equipped with on-line HPLC analysis of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives. To avoid losses in yield, small peptides were covalently attached to Sequelon-AA membrane by carbodiimide activation as described by the manufacturer (Millipore). For amino-terminal sequencing of intact α1(II) and α3(XI) chains, blocking amino-terminal pyroglutamate residues were removed enzymatically before SDS-PAGE(30Podell D.N. Abraham G.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Individual α1-, α2-, and α3-chains of pepsin-extracted type XI collagen were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 1). All three chains revealed borotritide-labeled residues (Fig. 1). No pyridinoline cross-links were detected in the type XI collagen purified from fetal articular cartilage (<0.01 residues of hydroxylysylpyridinoline/collagen molecule; data not shown). Fig. 2 compares reverse-phase HPLC profiles of tryptic peptides from α1(II) and α3(XI) chains of fetal cartilage. The UV absorbance profiles are essentially the same, indicating the same primary structure (Fig. 2a), confirmed by amino-terminal sequencing of several peaks (data not shown; see also Figure 7:, Figure 8:, Figure 9:). However, α3(XI) was quite different from α1(II) in its cross-linking profile, lacking pyridinolines (Fig. 2b) and featuring borohydride-reducible cross-links (Fig. 2c). The 3H activity of α3(XI) was four times that of α1(II). Amino-terminal Edman degradation revealed two peptide sequences from each of the cross-linked peptides. The molecular sites of the divalent cross-links and pyridinolines in type II collagen were the same(20Eyre D.R. Apone S. Wu J.J. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), with N-telopeptides (DEXAGGAQ) linked to residue 930 and C-telopeptides (GQREXGPDP) linked to residue 87. In contrast, only one helical site of cross-linking was found to be occupied in α3(XI), linking the sequence GLXGHR, where X is the known cross-linking hydroxylysine at residue 930, to the N-telopeptide domain of α1(XI). The two tritium-labeled tryptic peptides resolved from α3(XI) (Fig. 2c) both gave sequences indicating an origin at this site but differing in pepsin cleavage site. Fig. 3 shows the reverse-phase HPLC elution profile of tryptic peptides from the α1(XI) and α2(XI) chains. Peptides containing 3H activity were sequenced either directly or after further purification by anion exchange and reverse-phase HPLC (chromatographic steps not shown). All 3H-labeled peptides gave two running sequences on Edman degradation (in about 1:1 molar ratio). Peptide A1 matched an α3(XI) (or α1(II)) C-telopeptide linked to the cross-linking domain near the amino terminus of α1(XI). Peptides A2 and A3 both gave an α2(XI) N-telopeptide sequence and a fragment containing the putative cross-linking site near the COOH terminus of α1(XI). The helical sequence of A3 was 39 residues longer than that of A2 at the amino terminus by comparison with the published cDNA(9Bernard M. Yoshioka H. Rodriguez E. van der Rest M. Kimura T. Ninomiya H. Olsen B.R. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17159-17166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incomplete hydroxylation of lysine residue 921 resulting in partial cleavage by trypsin can explain this. All three cross-linked peptides under peaks B1, B2, and B3 were derived from a site of covalent interaction between hydroxylysine residue 924 of the α2(XI) triple helix and an α3(XI) (or α1(II)) N-telopeptide, the latter presumably providing the hydroxylysine aldehyde. The individual α(XI) chains isolated by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 1) were treated with sodium periodate to release cross-linked telopeptides from the helical sites. The α1(XI) chain released two 3H-labeled peptides (Fig. 4), one a fragment of the α1(II) (or α3(XI)) C-telopeptide, the other of the α2(XI) N-telopeptide (see Fig. 3). The α2(XI) chain gave two 3H-labeled peptides; both were fragments of the α3(XI) (or α1(II)) N-telopeptide, one bearing an additional amino-terminal phenylalanine. The α3(XI) chain yielded two tritiated peptides, both from the α1(XI) N-telopeptide. Fig. 5 summarizes the results identifying molecular sites of cross-linking in collagen type XI. The molecules must be cross-linked in cartilage matrix primarily in a head-to-tail fashion. The identified cross-links are mostly derived from type XI to type XI interactions. Of the two prospective cross-linking sites in the triple-helix of the molecule, only one appears to be occupied (the one near the COOH terminus). Each chain (α1(XI), α2(XI), and α3(XI)) shows preferential links to a specific telopeptide. Thus, α1(XI) is linked to an α2(XI) N-telopeptide, α2(XI) to an α3(XI) (or α1(II)) N-telopeptide, and α3(XI) to an α1(XI) N-telopeptide. Only one chain, α1(XI), was occupied at the amino end of the helix (residue 84), where the α1(II) (or α3(XI)) C-telopeptide was attached. Because the latter sequence is identical in α1(II) and α3(XI), the molecular origin, whether type II or XI, is uncertain. The location of cross-linking hydroxylysine residues in the N-telopeptide domains of α1(XI) and α2(XI) was an unexpected finding. From cDNA data(11Yoshioka H. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6423-6426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zhidkova N. Brewton R.G. Mayne R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), there are no lysines in the putative telopeptide domains as defined by the predicted N-propeptidase cleavage site. It turns out, however, that the non-helical cross-linking sites in the α1- and α2-chains are located outside the putative N-propeptidase cleavage locus (Fig. 6). Therefore, the N-propeptide extensions on the type XI collagen molecule must not be cleaved at these sites in the cross-linked extracellular protein. The following results confirmed this. Amino-terminal sequencing of the α3(XI) chain from native molecules of type XI collagen extracted by 1 M NaCl showed that it retained its full N-propeptide extension. The α1(II) chain from native type II collagen molecules in the same extract did not (Fig. 7). The sequence data also showed that the α3(XI) chain was the IIB splicing product of the COL2A1 gene, which lacks the exon 2 coding domain(31Ryan M.C. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10334-10339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triple helical domains from the N-propeptides of type XI collagen were isolated from the 4 M NaCl precipitated fraction of a pepsin digest of fetal bovine cartilage. Proteoglycans and uncross-linked collagen molecules had been removed from the tissue by extraction in 4 M guanidine HCl before digestion. Fig. 8 shows the resolution of the N-propeptide fragments by molecular sieve chromatography. The earliest peak included pepsin and the COL1 domains of type IX collagen. The second peak contained mainly collagenous fragments of type XI N-propeptides. Individual peptides in the fractions shown by the bar were isolated by reverse-phase HPLC. Peptides were identified by amino-terminal sequencing (Fig. 9). The α3(XI) sequence was matched to that reported for human COL2A1 cDNA(32Baldwin C.T. Reginato A.M. Smith C. Jiminez S.A. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The yields of α1(XI), α2(XI), and α3(XI) fragments were about 1:1:1. The results are consistent with type XI collagen molecules in their polymeric, cross-linked state in cartilage matrix, retaining their N-propeptides at least to the extent of their triple helical domains.Figure 9:Reverse-phase HPLC of collagen XI N-propeptides. Fractions marked by the bar in Fig. 8 were concentrated and eluted on reverse-phase HPLC by a 0-30% linear gradient of B in A over 60 min (see Fig. 2 legend). The elution positions and amino-terminal sequences of the helical domains from each type XI chain N-propeptide are shown. Material eluting in fractions 22-26 proved to be an over-cleavage product of the α1(II) main helix, beginning at residue 938.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In cartilage, collagen fibrils are strengthened by covalent intermolecular bonds. Types II, IX, and XI collagens are all present as covalently cross-linked polymers in cartilage, but their precise distribution and molecular inter-relationships are unclear. Both types II and IX collagens contain the trivalent mature pyridinoline cross-linking residues, even in the fetal tissue, but most prominently in adult cartilage (Fig. 2)(20Eyre D.R. Apone S. Wu J.J. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 24Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 20: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 25Wu J.J. Woods P.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23007-23014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in type XI collagen the cross-links remain as the initial divalent ketoamines even in the mature tissue(2Eyre D.R. Wu J.J. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 261-281Google Scholar, 33Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 460: 520-523Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Before molecular sieve purification, some type IX collagen (COL2 domain) was evident in the preparation on an SDS-PAGE immunoblot using anti-type IX collagen antiserum(34Diab M. Wu J.J. Shapiro F. Eyre D. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1994; 49: 402-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This contamination may in part contribute to the low content of pyridinoline residues observed in less rigorously purified type XI collagen preparations(2Eyre D.R. Wu J.J. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 261-281Google Scholar). Thus, type XI collagen prepared from fetal epiphyseal cartilage contains only divalent borohydride-reducible ketoamines. No pyridinoline residues are detected, whereas collagens II and IX even from fetal cartilage contain significant amounts of pyridinoline (24Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 20: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 25Wu J.J. Woods P.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23007-23014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Type XI collagen from fetal cartilage consist mostly of heterotrimeric molecules of composition (α1(XI)α2(XI)α3(XI))(8Morris N.P. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11345-11350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present structural analyses on the cross-linking sites show that highly specific, non-random molecular interactions had occurred in the tissue. The microsequencing results on purified tryptic peptides that contained the divalent cross-links and on telopeptides released by periodate indicated that type XI collagen molecules are primarily cross-linked to each other head-to-tail in cartilage matrix (Fig. 10). The cross-links are chain-specific between N-telopeptides and COOH-terminal helical sites in adjacent molecules (i.e. α1 N-telopeptide to α2 COOH-terminal helix, α2 N-telopeptide to α3 COOH-terminal helix, and α3 N-telopeptide to α1 COOH-terminal helix; Fig. 5). No firm conclusion is possible on the source of the C-telopeptide sequence found attached to residue 84 in α1(XI), i.e. whether from type II collagen, the α3-chain of type XI collagen, or both. Similar analyses of type V collagen of bone showed the occurrence of heterotypic intermolecular cross-linking between types I and V collagens, mediated by a C-telopeptide of α1(I) linked to a COOH-terminal helical site in α1(V)(7Eyre D.R. Wu J.J. Niyibizi C. Cohn D.V. Glorieux F.H. Martin T.J. Calcium Regulation and Bone Metabolism. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1990: 188-194Google Scholar, 35Niyibizi C. Eyre D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The structure and cross-linking properties of types V and XI collagens appear to be similar, except that type XI associates with type II and type V associates with type I. It has been shown by immunoelectron microscopy that type XI collagen is codistributed with type II collagen in cartilage matrix(3Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 36Petit B. Ronziere M.C. Hartman D.J. Herbage D. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). From the type V collagen evidence, we suspect, therefore, that the C-telopeptide sequence recovered from the α1(XI) chain originated primarily in molecules of type II collagen. From cDNA data, both α1(XI) and α2(XI) include an unusually large globular amino terminus (NC3), which together with the collagenous domain (COL2) forms the N-propeptide. Each N-propeptide accounts for about 25% of the total chain mass(9Bernard M. Yoshioka H. Rodriguez E. van der Rest M. Kimura T. Ninomiya H. Olsen B.R. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17159-17166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kimura T. Cheah K.S.E. Chan S.D.H. Lui V.C.H. Mattei M-G. van der Rest M. Ono K. Solomon E. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. J. Biol.

Brewton R.G. Mayne R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The present results confirm that, in part at least, the N-propeptides of all three chains, α1(XI), α2(XI) and α3(XI), are retained on the molecules cross-linked in the extracellular matrix of cartilage (Fig. 9)(8Morris N.P. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11345-11350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Thom J.R. Morris N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7262-7269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with observations on type V collagen (38Fessler J.H. Fessler L.I. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 81-103Google Scholar). The propeptides presumably confer specific properties on the matrix, for example by regulating the intermolecular cross-linking properties of the molecule or restricting the lateral growth of fibrils. Prior work has indicated that type XI collagen may preferentially exist in the form of thin fibrils, which can be heteropolymeric structures embodying types II and IX collagens(3Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 36Petit B. Ronziere M.C. Hartman D.J. Herbage D.

It has been shown that type IX collagen molecules decorate and are covalently linked to the surface of such fibrils(20Eyre D.R. Apone S. Wu J.J. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23007-23014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas type XI collagen molecules appear to be in the interior(3Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 36Petit B. Ronziere M.C. Hartman D.J. Herbage D. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The present results are consistent with the latter concept but add the knowledge that type XI collagen molecules must be cross-linked primarily to each other. It is not clear whether they form a core at the center of fibrils (3Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 36Petit B. Ronziere M.C. Hartman D.J. Herbage D. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or are distributed under the surface of type II fibrils as proposed for types V and I copolymeric collagen fibrils in cornea(42Linsenmayer T.F. Gibney E. Igoe F. Gordon M.K. Fitch J.M. Fessler L.I. Birk D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown essentially the same CNBr-peptide profile for α3(XI) as α1(II), except for slower α3(XI) peptide mobilities on SDS-PAGE. This difference is explained by post-translational over-modification(2Eyre D.R. Wu J.J. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 261-281Google Scholar, 6Burgeson R.E. Hollister D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 87: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 8Morris N.P. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11345-11350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another noted difference was in the mobility of peptide CB9,7(27Eyre D.R. Wu J.J. Woolley D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 118: 724-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The present results confirm identity in primary structure of α1(II) and α3(IX) but show cross-linking differences. The most likely explanation, therefore, for the mobility shift on SDS-PAGE of CB9,7 is the attachment of a degradation product of the N-propeptide of α1(XI) instead of α1(II) to helical residue 930 (Fig. 2). Of particular interest also was the finding that the N-telopeptide cross-linking lysines in α1(XI) and α2(XI) lie amino-terminal rather than COOH-terminal to the putative N-propeptidase cleavage sites. Because stromelysin (MMP3) can cleave native type XI collagen molecules at sites between the N-telopeptide cross-links and the main triple-helix(26Wu J.J. Lark M.W. Chun L.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5625-5628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the findings imply a chondrocyte mechanism for remodeling of the collagenous matrix. Chondrocytes are capable of producing stromelysin(43Okada Y. Shinmei M. Tanaka O. Naka K. Kimura A. Nakanishi I. Bayliss M.T. Iwata K. Nagase H. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 680-690PubMed Google Scholar), and stromelysin has already been shown to be capable of degrading type IX collagen and telopeptide domains of type II collagen(26Wu J.J. Lark M.W. Chun L.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5625-5628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, selective proteolysis of type XI and type IX collagens could bring about changes in fibril architecture without removing the bulk fabric.

A likely mechanism for this action is the induction by IFNα of thymidine phosphorylase (TP), the first enzyme in one pathway for the metabolic activation of FUra to fluorodeoxyribonucleotides. To test this hypothesis, an expression vector containing the TP cDNA was transfected into HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells. Five stable transfectants were selected and analyzed. All showed increased sensitivity to FUra cytotoxicity, ranging from a 2-fold to a 19-fold decrease in the IC50 for FUra, compared to wild-type cells. Levels of TP mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity were elevated in the transfectants, and there was a significant correlation between the relative increase in sensitivity to FUra and both the increase in both TP mRNA levels and TP activity. Transfected cells exhibited increased formation of FdUMP, but not the ribonucleotides FUDP and FUTP, from FUra when compared to wild-type cells. The changes in TP activity, FdUMP formation, and FUra sensitivity in the transfected cells were comparable with those seen after treatment of wild-type cells with IFNα. These studies provide direct evidence for the role of TP in mediating the sensitivity of colon carcinoma cells to FUra, and further support the importance of the induction of TP in the biomodulating action of IFNα on FUra chemosensitivity.

More recently, interest in TP has focused on the intriguing observations that TP expression is inducible by interferon and other cytokines (8Schwartz E.L. Hoffman M. O'Connor C.J. Wadler S. Biochem.

Treatment of human colon carcinoma cells with IFNα caused a 5-10-fold increase in the levels of TP mRNA and enzyme activity (8Schwartz E.L. Hoffman M. O'Connor C.J. Wadler S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Surg. Oncol. 1989; 42: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The induction of TP expression by interferon was accompanied by an increase in the cellular levels of the active metabolite of FUra, FdUMP, presumably due to the sequential actions of TP and thymidine kinase on FUra(8Schwartz E.L.

When transfected into either MCF7 breast carcinoma cells or ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells, TP/PD-ECGF was found to increase the both the vascularization and the growth of the tumors in nude mice after subcutaneous inoculation of the cells(10Ishikawa F.

The regulation of TP/PD-ECGF by platelet agonists suggests that its expression may contribute to the response to injury to the endothelial lining of blood vessels(6Shaw J. Smillie R.H. Miller A.E.

In clinical trials of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with FUra and IFNα, response rates were seen that were greater than historical controls treated with FUra alone(27Wadler S.

In vitro studies have suggested that the induction of TP expression by IFNα is a potential biochemical mechanism for the modulation of the antitumor activity of FUra by IFNα. In this report, we demonstrate that transfection of TP into human colon carcinoma cells greatly increases the sensitivity of the cells to FUra, and that this action is mediated by the enhancement of the metabolic activation of FUra by increased TP expression. Human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and gentamicin, in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37°C. Recombinant human thymidine phosphorylase (also known as platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor) was obtained from R& Systems (Minneapolis, MN). It was greater than 97% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with silver staining. Human recombinant interferon α-2a (Roferon) was provided by Hoffmann-La Roche (Nutley, NJ). HT-29 cells were stably transfected with a construct containing the human TP cDNA under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV-TPneo; kindly provided by Dr. Roy Bicknell, Oxford University)(26Moghaddam A. Zhang H. Fan T.D. Hu D. Lees V.C. Turley H. Fox S. Gatter K.C. Harris A.L. Bicknell R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 998-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Cells (2.5 × 105/well in 12-well plates) were incubated with plasmid DNA (0.5 μg/well) and Lipofectamine (8 μl/well; Life Technologies, Inc.), using conditions recommended by the manufacturer. After 72 h, the cells were trypsinized and suspended in fresh medium containing G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.; 0.5 mg/ml). After an additional 3 weeks, wells with individual large colonies growing were transferred to flasks and were maintained in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml G418. TP activity was measured in extracts from wild-type and transfected HT-29 cells, and from wild-type cells treated with IFNα (500 units/ml). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mM EDTA. The cells were sonicated on ice and centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored at −70°C until assayed. Assays contained 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 μg of cell extract, and 0.25 mM (20 μCi/ml) [methyl-3H]thymine (DuPont NEN). Reactions were stopped at 40 min by boiling, tubes were briefly centrifuged, and supernatants were spotted on silica gel thin layer chromatography plates. Separation of [3H]thymine from [3H]thymidine was done using chloroform:methanol:acetic acid (17:3:1), and activity was calculated based on the percent conversion of base to nucleoside. TP activity was proportional to both the amount of protein assayed and time. Wild-type and transfected HT-29 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA. The cells were sonicated on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. 50 μg of supernatant protein was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were electroblotted onto nylon membranes, and incubated with rabbit anti-human TP (1:2000; kindly provided by Dr. A. Yoshimura, Kagoshima University) and a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Schleicher & Schuell), according to directions supplied by the manufacturer. Immunolabeled proteins were visualized using x-ray film after incubation with LumiPhos (Schleicher & Schuell). RNA was extracted from control and IFNα-treated cells with guanidinium thiocyanate, purified by centrifugation through CsCl, and poly(A)+ RNA isolated on oligo(dT)-cellulose using standard procedures. The RNA (10 μg) was fractionated on formaldehyde-containing agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with 32P-labeled human TP cDNA (pPL8, kindly provided by Dr. Carl-Henrik Heldin), washed, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at −85°C. Blots were stripped and reprobed with a 32P-labeled human actin cDNA. Autoradiograms were scanned with densitometer to quantify band densities. Growth inhibition was measured after treatment of cells with FUra for 7 days in 96-well plates (4 × 103 HT-29 cells/well in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum); increasing concentrations of FUra were added after allowing for cell attachment overnight. Cell numbers were quantitated by staining with sulforhodamine B, as has been described previously (31Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8935) Google Scholar). Wild-type and transfected HT-29 cells were incubated with 1 μM [6-3H]FUra (3 Ci/mmol; Moravek Biochemicals) with or without 500 units/ml IFNα. After 24 h, cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted with 0.5 N perchloric acid. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatants were removed and neutralized with 1.5 volumes of alamine/freon, lyophilized, and reconstituted in HPLC mobile phase(8Schwartz E.L. Hoffman M. O'Connor C.J. Wadler S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1232-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). An aliquot was analyzed by HPLC; fractions were collected and radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation counting. Separation of fluoropyrimidine nucleotides was done using an Adsorbosphere C18 column (Alltech) as described previously(8Schwartz E.L. Hoffman M. O'Connor C.J. Wadler S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1232-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recovery of radioactive material from the HPLC was greater than 95%. Identity of radioactive peaks was determined using authentic standards. Wild-type and transfected HT-29 cells were incubated with 1 μM [6-3H]FUra for 24 h, as described above. Cells were lysed and RNA and DNA isolated using phenol/guanidine isothiocyanate (Trizol, Life Technologies, Inc.). Radioactivity in the RNA and DNA fractions were determined by liquid scintillation counting. The DNA fraction was exhaustively digested with RNase and ethanol-precipitated prior to measurement of radioactivity. TS activity was measured based on 3H2O release from [5-3H]dUMP in the presence of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate(32Roberts D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3546-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The assay contained, in 150 μl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 μM [5-3H]dUMP (0.33 Ci/mmol), and 250 μM 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. Reactions were started by the addition of cell extract and were incubated for 10 min at 37°C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.8 ml of ice-cold 3% acid charcoal; after 10 min on ice, the samples were centrifuged (10 min at 10,000 rpm), and a 0.5-ml aliquot of the supernatant assayed for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. Reactions were linear with respect to time and protein concentration and were dependent on reduced folate for activity. The role of TP in mediating the sensitivity of cells to FUra was investigated by transfecting an expression vector (pcDNAI-Neo) containing the human TP cDNA (pPL5) into HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells. The HT-29 cells were chosen as targets because IFNα has been shown previously to induce TP activity and increase sensitivity to FUra in these cells(8Schwartz E.L. Hoffman M. O'Connor C.J. Wadler S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1232-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 22Schwartz E.L. Baptiste N. O'Connor C.J. Wadler S. Otter B.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1472-1478PubMed Google Scholar), and because colon carcinomas are most often treated with FUra. Several colonies of cells were obtained upon selection of transfected HT-29 cells in G418, and five independent clones (designated tp1-tp5) were chosen for further analysis. The rate of cell growth of the transfected cells did not vary more than 20% from the growth rate of the wild-type cells (data not shown). The sensitivity of the cells to FUra growth inhibition was evaluated by treating the cells with the fluoropyrimidine for 6 days. Increasing concentrations of FUra caused progressively greater cytotoxicity and growth inhibition of the cells; the concentration of FUra producing a 50% reduction in the number of cells (IC50) in the wild-type (wt) HT-29 cells was 2.5 μM (Fig. 1 and Table 1). All five of the transfected cell lines were more sensitive to the cytotoxic actions of FUra when compared to HT-29/wt cells, with most of the cell lines having a 2-5-fold decrease in the IC50, and one of the transfectants (tp3) exhibiting a 19-fold increase in sensitivity to FUra with an IC50 of 0.13 μM (Table1).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Expression of TP in the transfected cells was then examined. A 1.8-kb mRNA for TP was barely detectable in the HT-29/wt cells (Fig. 2), similar to previous studies of this cell line(23Schwartz E.L. Baptiste N. Megati S. Wadler S. Otter B.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55 (in press)Google Scholar). Somewhat higher levels of mRNA expression were found in TP transfectants 1, 2, 4, and 5, and a substantially higher abundance of TP mRNA was observed in the tp3 transfectant (Fig. 2). The sizes of the predominant messages in the wt and tp1 to tp4 cells were similar (1.7-1.8 kb), whereas the mRNA in tp5 was smaller (1.3 kb). Two additional bands of 1.1 and 2.3 kb were also observed in the tp3 cells. TP mRNA levels were quantitated by densitometric scanning and corrected for actin expression (Table1). The relative increase in expression of the 1.3-1.8-kb mRNAs in the cell lines was found to be significantly correlated (r = 0.98) with the relative decline in the IC50 values for FUra. Thymidine phosphorylase protein levels were determined on immunoblots after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of soluble cell extracts from wt and TP-transfected HT-29 cells (Fig. 3). A band corresponding to the recombinant TP standard (lane7) was only detected in the tp3 cells, with an apparent size of approximately 50 kDa. TP enzyme activity was measured in crude cell extracts using [3H]thymine as substrate and in the presence of excess dR-1-P. Enzyme activity was higher in all the transfectants when compared to the wild-type cells (Table1). The largest increase, greater than 5-fold compared to HT-29/wt cells, was found in the tp3 cells, and the other transfected cell lines had increases of approximately 2-fold. Comparison of the enzyme activity with sensitivity to FUra cytotoxicity demonstrated that the cell line with the highest enzyme active, tp3, had the greatest increase in sensitivity to FUra. The other transfectants, which had intermediate elevations in TP activity, had more modest increases in sensitivity to FUra. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.94) between the relative increase in TP activity and the relative decrease in the IC50 for FUra. Although there was a strong correlation between TP activity and sensitivity to FUra among the cell lines examined, other factors could conceivably contribute to the changes in the IC50 values observed. The level of TS expression has been shown previously to correlate with responsive to FUra in vitro and in vivo, with high TS levels conferring resistance to FUra by circumventing the inhibition of TS that results from the binding of the FUra metabolite, FdUMP, to the enzyme(33Johnston P.G. Drake J.C. Trepel J. Allegra C.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4306-4312PubMed Google Scholar, 34Johnston P.G. Lenz H.J. Leichman C.G. Danenberg K.D. Allegra C.J. Danenberg P.V. Leichman L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1407-1412PubMed Google Scholar). To eliminate differences in TS as a potential explanation for the increase in sensitivity of the HT-29/tp3 cells, TS levels were measured in these and the wild-type cells using a catalytic assay. Rather than exhibiting a decrease in TS activity, the HT-29/tp3 cells had an increase in activity, 0.312 ± 0.065 pmol/min/mg, compared to the value obtained in the wild-type cells, 0.226 ± 0.026 pmol/min/mg. It was anticipated that the increased expression of TP in the HT-29/tp3 cells would lead to greater metabolic activation of FUra to deoxyribonucleotides. The intracellular disposition of [3H]FUra in the HT-29/tp3 cells was therefore compared to that in HT-29/wt cells. The incorporation of FUra into DNA and RNA was 10-20% lower in the HT-29/tp3 cells, and the levels of total cellular fluoropyrimidines and fluoropyrimidine ribonucleotides FUDP and FUTP were similarly unchanged in the HT-29/tp3 cells compared to the HT-29/wt cells (Table2). In contrast, cellular FdUMP levels were found to be 2.2-fold higher in the transfected cells.TABLE II Open table in a new tab The effect of the elevated TP expression in the transfected cells on FdUMP levels and sensitivity to FUra cytotoxicity was compared to these parameters in IFNα-treated cells, which also express elevated TP activity. The increase in TP activity was directly correlated with FdUMP levels, and indirectly correlated with the IC50 for FUra (Fig. 4). In all instances, the greatest change was observed in the HT-29/tp3 cells compared to the HT-29/wt cells, with IFNα-treated HT-29/wt cells having intermediate degrees of change. The changes observed in the TP-transfected cells provide direct evidence that an increase in TP activity can increase the sensitivity of cells to FUra via an increased formation of FdUMP, an active metabolite of FUra. The fact that the relationship between TP activity, FdUMP levels, and FUra cytotoxicity in interferon-treated cells are quantitatively consistent with those seen in the transfected cells strongly supports a role for the induction of the enzyme in the mechanism of action of IFNα in these cells. The data obtained in the present study are also consistent with previously published reports, which indicated that resistance to FUra can occur as a consequence of the loss of TP activity. For example, mutants in thymidine phosphorylase that are resistant to FUra can be isolated by selection of microorganisms with FUra(35Martinussen J. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6457-6463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A human ovarian cancer cell line derived from a biopsy of a FUra-resistant tumor was found to have a 70% reduction in TP activity and FdUMP levels compared to a cell line derived from the tumor in the same patient prior to the development of FUra resistance(36Chu E. Lai G. Zinn S. Allegra C.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 410-417PubMed Google Scholar). TP activity has been found to vary considerably among different tissues and among different individuals(4Zimmerman M. Seidenberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2618-2621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Yoshimura A. Kuwazuru Y. Furukawa T. Yoshida H. Yamada K. Akiyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1034: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).2 This suggests that in many instances, the level of TP expression in an individual may be an important determinant of the degree of responsiveness of a particular tumor to FUra, and a preliminary study of mononuclear cell TP in patients undergoing FUra-based chemotherapy supports this hypothesis.2 Furthermore, since TP levels have been found to be elevated in most colon carcinomas examined compared to non-malignant tissues(4Zimmerman M. Seidenberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2618-2621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Yoshimura A. Kuwazuru Y. Furukawa T. Yoshida H. Yamada K. Akiyama S. Biochim. Biophys.

Cancer. 1991; 68: 1903-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), its expression may provide some degree of selectivity to the cytotoxic effects of FUra and therefore contribute to the clinical efficacy of the fluoropyrimidine in colon cancer. Other biochemical determinants of response to FUra, most notably the cellular levels of thymidylate synthase, have also been shown to be of value in predicting clinical response to FUra(34Johnston P.G.

TP has recently been shown to be identical to the angiogenic factor PD-ECGF, and a study of ovarian cancer biopsies demonstrated that TP/PD-ECGF was the only one of four angiogenic factors examined whose mRNA level was elevated in malignant tumors when compared to benign tumors, and expression levels were found to be highest in regions of high blood flow within individual tumors(38Reynolds K. Farzaneh F. Collins W.P. Campbell S. Bourne T.H. Lawton F. Moghaddam A. Harris A.L. Bicknell R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994; 86: 1234-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A recent study of 91 primary colorectal carcinomas (who were not treated with chemotherapy) found that the expression of TP in tumor specimens was statistically correlated with depth of tumor invasion, frequency of metastasis, and a shorter survival time, when compared to tumors that were found not to be expressing TP(39Takebayashi Y. Yamada K. Sumizawa T. Miyadera K. Aikou T. Akiyama S. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1995; 36: 90Google Scholar). Hence, the data suggest that elevated TP/PD-ECGF expression predisposes to both aggressive disease and improved response to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. Since angiogenesis is also involved in embryogenesis, wound healing, rheumatoid arthritis, and certain retinopathies, TP/PD-ECGF likely exerts a range of biochemical actions that mediate both normal and pathologic cellular functions (18Folkman J. Klagsburn M. Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar). While the present study helps to define the role of TP in the modulating actions of IFNα on FUra, the induction of TP expression likely provides a biochemical basis for other physiologic and therapeutic actions of IFN and other cytokines."

To explore the mechanism of RSK activation, a cloned human RSK cDNA (RSK3) was used to generate and characterize several site-directed RSK mutants: K91A (N-Lys, NH2-terminal ATP-binding mutant), K444A (C-Lys, COOH-terminal ATP-binding mutant), N/C-Lys (double ATP-binding mutant), T570A (C-Thr, mutant of the putative MAPK phosphorylation site in subdomain VIII of the C-domain), S218A (N-Ser, mutant of the corresponding NH2-terminal residue). Epitope-tagged RSKs were expressed in transfected COS cells followed by immunoprecipitation with or without prior in vivo epidermal growth factor stimulation. Kinase activity (S6 peptide) of N/C-Lys and N-Lys was ablated (and partially impaired with N-Ser). In contrast, both C-Lys and C-Thr retained high levels of kinase activity and were capable of responding to stimulation. C-Lys also retained partial kinase activity toward other substrates (c-Fos, S40 ribosomes, protein phosphatase 1 G-subunit, histones, and Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide)) whereas NLys did not. The isolated NH2- and COOH-terminal domains were also expressed; the C-domain was inactive, whereas the N-domain retained partial activity. Relative to wild-type, both N-Lys and C-Lys (as well as N-Ser and C-Thr) underwent partial in vitro autophosphorylation that was further stimulated by EGF protein tyrosine phosphatase. We conclude that 1) the NH2-terminal RSK kinase domain mediates substrate phosphorylation; 2) both domains contribute to autophosphorylation; 3) the putative MAPK phosphorylation site is not required for growth factor-stimulated autophosphorylation or kinase activation.

An additional important role for RSK involves its phosphorylation of the G-subunit of protein phosphatase 1 and glycogen synthase kinase-3, since these events contribute to the regulation of glycogen metabolism by insulin(10Cohen P.

Thus, the RSK polypeptide contained two non-identical complete kinase domains. The NH2-terminal kinase domain is related to protein kinases C and the catalytic subunit of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent kinases (40-45%); whereas the COOH-terminal domain bears 30-35% homology to phosphorylase b kinase and calcium/calmodulin kinases(29Jones S.W.

Strong evolutionary pressure to conserve this structure was further demonstrated by the report of a highly related Drosophila RSK homolog(35Erikson R.L. Alcorta D.A. Sweet L.J. Jones S.W. Vik T.

In spite of intensive recent interest in RSK, the functional importance of dual ATP-binding sites and distinct kinase domains remains obscure. Given that RSK exhibits broader substrate specificity than the other class of S6 kinase, p70/85S6k(12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Protein Kinases: Frontiers in Molecular Biology.

Trans. 1993; 21: 901-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), it is possible that individual RSK kinase domains mediate phosphorylation of different substrates or have other roles in substrate recognition or activation.RSK is regulated by phosphorylation on Ser (mostly) and Thr residues which is mediated by upstream Ser/Thr kinases and by additional autophosphorylation(12Kyriakis J.M.

Furthermore, the enzyme does not contain phosphotyrosine and can be dephosphorylated and deactivated by protein phosphatase 2A(12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R.

Several lines of evidence suggest that isoforms of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), in particular p44MAPK (ERK1) and p42MAPK (ERK2), are upstream activators of RSK(25Lavoinne A. Erikson E.

These residues are conserved in all known RSK isoforms(25Lavoinne A. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Price D.J. Avruch J. Cohen P. Eur. J.

Since the first Thr residue is followed by Pro, they suggested that this was the major site of transphosphorylation by MAPKs which are known to be proline-directed(5Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, MAPK phosphorylated only the first Thr in a peptide containing both residues(43Sutherland C. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).In order to explore the mechanism of RSK activation and the functions of the two-domain structure, we expressed epitope-tagged wild-type and mutated versions of a cloned human RSK cDNA (44Zhao Y. Bj⊘rbæk C. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Moller D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) in COS cells and characterized their function. Here we report: (i) phosphorylation of several known RSK substrates is mediated exclusively by the NH2-terminal kinase domain, (ii) in vitro RSK autophosphorylation is partially impaired by mutation of either ATP-binding site, (iii) mutation of the putative MAPK-phosphorylated Thr is associated with normal kinase activity and a preserved ability to respond to growth factor stimulation, (iv) an NH2-terminal Ser residue that is important for maximal kinase activity is identified.MATERIALS AND METHODSProteins and PeptidesS6 kinase substrate peptide (RRRLSSLRA) and Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) were purchased from UBI (Lake Placid, NY) and Sigma, respectively. 40 S ribosomal subunits isolated from rat liver were a generous gift from Dr. Joseph Avruch (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA); recombinant rabbit protein phosphatase 1 (PP1G, amino acids 1-442) was kindly provided by Dr. Anna A. DePaoli-Roach (Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN); recombinant c-Fos was a gift from Dr. Tom Curran (Roche Institute of Molecular Biology, Nutley, NJ). Histones H1, H2B, H3 were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim; Yersinia protein tyrosine phosphatase was obtained from Calbiochem. Human epidermal growth factor (EGF) was from Sigma.AntibodiesMonoclonal antibody 12CA5 against the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was from Babco (Emeryville, CA). N67, a rabbit polyclonal antibody, was raised against the synthetic peptide KFAVRRFFSVYLRR (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) which corresponds to amino acids 7-20 encoded by a human RSK cDNA designated as RSK3(44Zhao Y. Bj⊘rbæk C. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Moller D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar).Plasmids, Mutagenesis, in Vitro Transcription and TranslationThe coding region (2199 base pairs) of the human RSK3 cDNA (on EcoRI linkers) was subcloned into pGEM-11Zf(-) (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate pGEM-RSK3. Site-directed RSK mutants were generated in pGEM-RSK3 using the method of Deng and Nickoloff (45Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Mutagenic oligonucleotide primers and a selection primer designed to ablate a unique XbaI site in the pGEM polylinker were used with the TransformerTM Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to recommendations provided by the manufacturer. The following five mutants were generated, where N and C denote the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of the protein, respectively: N-Lys (K91A, Lys91 to Ala), N-Ser (S218A), C-Lys (K444A), C-Thr (T570A) and N/C-Lys (K91A/K444A). Two additional mutants of Ser218 were also generated: S218E and S218D. The sites of mutagenesis in each of the RSK mutant plasmids were sequenced (Sequenase 2.0, U.S. Biochemical, Cleveland, OH) to confirm that the appropriate nucleotide substitutions were present. In order to assure that the site-directed mutant RSK coding regions could generate full-length polypeptide products with equal efficiency, we performed in vitro transcription of wild-type and mutant pGEM-RSK3 plasmids using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) followed by in vitro translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN). Labeled polypeptides were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and visualized by autoradiography. Wild-type and each mutant plasmid generated a predominent 85 kDa protein band of similar intensity (data not shown). Subsequently, wild-type or mutagenized RSK3 cDNAs were excised from pGEM-RSK3 and transferred in-frame to the EcoRI site of pMT2-HA (gift of Joseph Avruch), a modified version of the pMT2 expression vector (46Kaufmann R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) which encodes the 9-amino-acid HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) in a position NH2-terminal to the EcoRI site.Two additional constructs designed for expression of the isolated NH2-terminal (RSKΔC) and COOH-terminal kinase (RSKΔN) domains were prepared as follows: for RSKΔC the wild-type RSK expression vector (pMT2-HA-RSK3) was digested with BsgI and DraIII followed by religation using a short double-stranded oligonucleotide adapter. This resulted in the in-frame removal of the entire COOH-terminal kinase domain via deletion of residues 384-689. For RSKΔN, a XhoI-MluI fragment encoding residues 33-219 was removed from pMT2-HA-RSK3/N-Ser (which had been previously modified to include a unique MluI site), followed by in-frame blunt-ended religation.Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and ImmunoprecipitationFor transient expression of mutant and wild-type HA-tagged RSK proteins in COS-7 cells, subconfluent cells in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 1.8 μg of plasmid DNA using lipofectamine (15 μl) as recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The pMT2-HA empty vector was included in all experiments as a control for subsequent assays. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 mg/ml streptomycin. Seventy-two h after transfection, cells were incubated for 6 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum followed by 15 min of stimulation with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) or tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (200 nM, Sigma). Cells were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in 500 μl of cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 5 mg/ml leupeptin, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were briefly sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 23,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, and subsequent steps were also performed at this temperature. HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 (1:250) and protein A-Sepharose beads (Boerhinger Mannheim) as described previously(47Zhu A.X. Zhao Y. Moller D.E. Flier J.S. Mol. Cell.

Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase assay buffer (KA buffer, 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA and 1 mM dithiothreitol).Immunoblot AnalysisFor immunoblotting of transfected mutant and wild-type RSK polypeptides, equal aliquots of 12CA5 immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 1 × Laemmli sample buffer (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) and subjected to SDS 8% PAGE. Resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and blocked with 10% non-fat dried milk as described previously(47Zhu A.X. Zhao Y. Moller D.E. Flier J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8202-8211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were then incubated with the N67 antiserum (1:1000 dilution) for 12-15 h. After removal of unbound antibodies, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin for 1 h and washed three times in buffered saline. Rabbit antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) and autoluminography.Protein Kinase AssaysS6 peptide and Kemptide were used at final concentrations of 0.3 mg/ml. Protein substrates were used at concentrations of 0.07 mg/ml. Kinase assays were initiated by the addition of 2.5 μl of 150 μM [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi) to the immune-complex pellet resuspended in 12.5 μl of 1.2 × KA buffer, including appropriate substrates, followed by incubation at 30°C for 10 min. In vitro RSK autophosphorylation was performed under conditions identical to kinase assays except that no substrates were added to the reaction mixture. For kinase assays including peptide substrates, the reaction was terminated by spotting the mixture onto phosphocellulose paper (Whatman p81). After thrice washing in 150 mM phosphoric acid, filters were subjected to Cerenkov counting. For kinase assays including protein substrates or for determination of autophosphorylation, the reactions were terminated by adding 7.5 μl of 3 × Laemmli sample buffer(48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). After heating at 95°C for 5 min, proteins were resolved by 15% (for protein substrates) or 8% (for RSK autophosphorylation) SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography and PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis.For protein tyrosine phosphatase treatment, aliquots of immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated in 15 μl of 30 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 5 mM dithiothreitol, with or without 0.8 milliunits protein tyrosine phosphatase/ml for 20 min at 30°C. Reactions were terminated by washing once with 1 ml of ice-cold KA buffer and resuspending in ice-cold KA buffer followed by determination of kinase activity and autophosphorylation as described above.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo investigate the role of the two kinase domains of the 90-kDa RSK in substrate phosphorylation and in growth factor-mediated activation of the enzyme, oligonucleotide-directed mutants of a human RSK cDNA were generated and characterized. For this purpose, we used the cDNA encoding a 733-amino-acid isoform designated as RSK3(44Zhao Y. Bj⊘rbæk C. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Moller D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). RSK3 is homologous (75-84% overall identity) to the two other known mammalian RSK isoforms (31Alcorta D.A. Crews C.M. Sweet L.J. Bankston L. Jones S.W. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell.

Diabetes. 1995; 44: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with a high degree (86-92%) of amino acid identity between the corresponding kinase domains in each isoform.In each of the two kinase domains, the invariant lysine (Lys91 and Lys444) in subdomain II (30Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar) was mutated to alanine to create N-Lys and C-Lys ATP-binding site mutants (Fig. 1A). Based on earlier studies(30Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar, 49Hunter T. Cooper J.A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Orlando1986: 191-246Google Scholar), each of these two mutations would be expected to markedly impair phosphotransferase activity mediated by the respective kinase domain. Also, a double kinase mutant (N/C-Lys) where both lysine residues were changed to alanine was created. Furthermore, to specifically address the possible role of Thr570 in subdomain VIII of the COOH-terminal domain in growth factor-mediated kinase activation, this residue was also mutated (C-Thr, Fig. 1A). This residue in RSK2 (also known as ISPK-1 or MAPKAP-1) Thr577(34Bj⊘rbæk C. Vik T.A. Echwald S.M. Yang P.Y. Vestergaard H. Wang J.P. Webb G.C. Richmond K. Hansen T. Erikson R.L. Gabor-Miklos G.L.

Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The corresponding residue in the NH2-terminal kinase domain, Ser218, was also mutated (N-Ser, Fig. 1A). Both Ser218 and Thr570 are located within 20 residues upstream of the highly conserved A(S)PE motif present in all protein kinases, a region known to often contain phosphorylation sites that are critical for catalytic function(30Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar).After using in vitro transcription/translation to verify that these five mutant and wild-type RSK polypeptides were synthesized with equal efficiency (not shown), the cDNA coding regions were cloned into pMT2-HA(32Grove J.R. Price D.J. Banerjee P. Balasubramanyam A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7727-7738Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), an expression vector containing the 9-residue influenza virus HA epitope tag. This allowed for the recombinant proteins to be isolated by immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody (12CA5) directed against the HA epitope after transient expression in transfected COS-7 cells. In each of several experiments that were performed, we verified that similar amounts of wild-type or mutated RSK proteins were present in 12CA5 immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody raised against the NH2 terminus of the human RSK3 protein (Fig. 1B). Analysis of immunoblotting data from nine independent experiments showed that mean levels of immunoprecipitated RSK protein for each of the five mutants did not differ from wild-type (see legend to Fig. 1B).We first compared the activities of HA-tagged mutant and wild-type proteins using an in vitro immune-complex kinase assay with immunoprecipitates from transfected cells. The cells were serum starved or serum starved followed by stimulation with EGF which has been reported to activate RSK(16Chen R.H. Chung J. Blenis J. Mol. Cell.

Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 87-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 11Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar).Modulation of the pituitary-gonadal axis via the GnRHR has proven to be therapeutically important, and extensive research has led to the development of several thousand peptide analogs(13Karten M. Rivier J.E. Endocr. Rev. 1986; 7: 44-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In contrast to some other peptides such as the tachykinins and cholecystokinin, for which small nonpeptide analogs have been identified, all GnRHR ligands reported thus far are peptides. Delineation of the precise contact sites between GnRH and its receptor is critical for developing an understanding of the relationship of the GnRHR binding pocket to that of other neurotransmitter and peptide receptors and for determining the molecular mechanisms underlying receptor activation. Ultimately this insight may lead to the design of novel GnRHR ligands.We have previously reported that a mutation in TMH 7 of the GnRHR restored binding, which had been eliminated by a mutation in TMH 2 (14Zhou W. Flanagan C.A. Ballesteros J. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar). The revertant character of mutations at these loci suggested that these two sites are in spatial proximity, a hypothesis that facilitated the refinement of a preliminary three-dimensional model of the receptor helix bundle constructed according to a set of integrated methods (15Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). This receptor model predicts that Lys121, located in the third TMH, is positioned in the ligand binding pocket of the receptor and would be accessible to GnRH. Lys121 is found in all six cloned mammalian GnRH receptors at a locus that corresponds to the position of the conserved Asp of the cationic amine receptors (Asp113 in the β-adrenergic receptor), a residue required for high affinity neurotransmitter binding(12Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 16Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Candelore M.R. Rands E. Hill W. Dixon R.A.F. J.

In order to investigate the role of Lys121 in ligand binding and activation of the GnRHR, a series of mutations was introduced at this position, and the resulting receptors were expressed and characterized in COS-1 cells. The results identify the role of charge-augmented hydrogen bonding at this position for the affinity of agonists but not antagonists.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and PeptidesAll chemicals, unless otherwise specified, were obtained from Sigma. GnRH (pyro-Glu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH2) and GnRH-A ([des-Gly10, D-Ala6, Pro-ethylamide9]-GnRH), a GnRH agonist, were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA).

Mutations were introduced as previously reported(14Zhou W. Flanagan C.A. Ballesteros J. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar). Mutated receptor cDNA inserts, confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Bio-Rad) were isolated after EcoRI/SphI digestion and ligated to pcDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) previously digested by the same restriction enzymes. One of the constructs studied, the Asp121 GnRHR, was generated from the mouse GnRHR using pAlter digested with EcoRI and XbaI(14Zhou W. Flanagan C.A. Ballesteros J. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar).Tissue Culture and DNA TransfectionCOS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and seeded into 100 mM plates at 3 million cells/plate the day before the transfection. A mixture of 10 μg of plasmid DNA and 100 μl of lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to transfect each plate of cells in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and an equal volume of media containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added 5 h after transfection.Phosphoinositol Hydrolysis AssayCells were harvested with trypsin 24 h after transfection and plated into 12-well dishes. 56 h after transfection, cells were labeled in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 μCi/ml of [myo-3H]inositol (DuPont NEN). 12-16 h later, cells were washed and exposed to GnRH agonist (plus antagonist for Schild analysis) and 20 mM of LiCl for 45 min at 37°C. Cell extracts in 10 mM formic acid at 4°C were loaded on the Dowex ion-exchange column and eluted with 1 M ammonium formate and 0.1 M formic acid.Irreversible Receptor Antagonism with 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic AcidCells were transfected, replated in 12-well dishes, and labeled with [myo-3H]inositol as described above. After rinsing at room temperature with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), cells were exposed to varying concentrations of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 8.0 for 30 min at 37°C. After rinsing, GnRH-stimulated phosphoinositol hydrolysis was assayed as above.Radiolabeled Ligand Binding AssayIodination of GnRH-A was catalyzed in the presence of Iodogen (Pierce) following published protocols(19Laws S.C. Beggs M.J. Webster J.C. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). 72 h after transfection, cells were scraped from the culture plates and centrifuged. Cell pellets were stored at −80°C for up to 2 months. 20-50 μg of crude membrane protein adjusted to 0.4 ml with assay buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) was incubated with 60,000 cpm of [125I]GnRH-A (~2.8 × 10−11M) at 4°C for 90 min and processed through a Brandel harvester (Life Technologies, Inc.). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10−7M cold ligand.Data and Statistical AnalysisThe counts obtained from PI hydrolysis assays were plotted using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) on a Macintosh computer and fitted against the formula, E = Emax/(1 + EC50/D), where Emax is the maximal response, EC50 is the concentration of the agonists that gives half of the maximal response, and D is the concentration of the agonist. To determine antagonist affinity, a Schild analysis (20Arunlakshana O. Schild H.O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1959; 14: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4270) Google Scholar) was performed. The ratio of EC50 in the presence and absence of antagonist was plotted against the corresponding antagonist concentration and fitted to the equation, log(EC50′/EC50− 1) = log[antagonist] − log(Kd antagonist). The slope of the best fit line obtained was found not to be significantly different from the theoretical slope of 1 (two-tailed t test). A paired t test was used to evaluate the significance of differential PI stimulation by Arg121 and wild-type receptors. Ki and Bmax values were determined using the LIGAND program(21Munson P.J. Robard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 58: 220-239Crossref Scopus (7760) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAffinity and Relative Efficacy of Agonists for the Wild-type and Mutant ReceptorsIn order to test the hypothesis that Lys121 interacts with GnRH, the effects on receptor function of substituting Arg, Gln, Leu, and Asp at this position were investigated. These mutations were designed to probe the characteristics of this proposed interaction. Arg preserves a charge-strengthened hydrogen bond donor at this locus. Gln retains a hydrogen bond donor but not an ionic charge. Leu eliminates all polar and ionic side chain interactions. Asp was introduced because it reverses the charge of Lys and is found in this position in neurotransmitter receptors. The progressive divergence from Lys of these substitutions allows the side chain properties required at this locus to be evaluated.Expression of the wild-type receptor in COS-1 cells generated high affinity binding of the radiolabeled agonist [125I]GnRH-A (Ki of GnRH-A = 1.8 ± 0.3 nM). When Arg was substituted for Lys121, affinity was comparable with that of the wild-type receptor (Ki = 3.3 ± 1.0 nM, Table1, Fig. 1). However, with the substitution of Gln, Leu, and Asp at this position, agonist binding was reduced below detectable limits. In order to provide further insight into the function of the mutant receptors, agonist-stimulated PI hydrolysis was also evaluated. The wild-type, Arg121, and Gln121 receptors were all able to mediate phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis. No stimulation was detected in cells transfected with the Leu121 or Asp121 receptor mutants (Fig. 2). The EC50 obtained with the Arg121 construct was comparable with that found with the expression of the wild-type receptor. The EC50 obtained with the Gln121 receptor, however, was more than 3 orders of magnitude higher (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The EC50 values obtained for stimulation with GnRH-A of the wild-type, Arg121, and Gln121 mutants showed the same trend, including the large relative increase for the Gln121 mutant (Table1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 2:GnRH-stimulated PI hydrolysis in COS-1 cells expressing mutant GnRHRs. The cells were transfected with the expression vector pcDNAI/Amp (▪), Leu121 (□), Gln121 (▴), Arg121 (•), or wild-type (○) GnRHRs, and the resulting increase in intracellular inositol phosphates was measured. The response was normalized to that obtained in the wild-type receptor. Data shown are the mean ± S.E. Each curve is representative of four to five replicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To evaluate the cause of the increased EC50 values obtained with the Gln121 receptor, the relationship between receptor expression and EC50 was examined. In several receptor expression systems, the EC50 has been found to depend on the number of receptors expressed(22Mei L. Lai J. Yamamura H.I. Roeske W.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 251: 90-97PubMed Google Scholar, 23Adham N. Ellerbrock B. Hartig P. Weinshank R.L. Branchek T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 427-433PubMed Google Scholar, 24Whaley B.S. Yuan N. Birnbaumer L. Clark R. Barber R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar). Such findings are compatible with the presence of “spare receptors” in these systems (25Kenakin T. Pharmacologic Analysis of Drug-Receptor Interaction. Raven Press, New York1993: 39-68Google Scholar). If the wild-type GnRHR were expressed in COS-1 cells with a high proportion of spare receptors, the increased EC50 observed with the Gln121 receptor could, in principle, be due to a marked decline in the level of mutant receptor expression. To evaluate this possibility, the effect of decreasing levels of receptor expression was studied using partial chemical modification to irreversibly antagonize an increasing proportion of receptors(26Furchgott R.F. Harper N.J. Simmonds A.B. Advances in Drug Research. Academic Press, New York1966: 21-55Google Scholar). Cells previously transfected with the wild-type GnRHR were exposed to varying concentrations of TNBS, which eliminates binding sites by reacting with free amino groups(27Haynes R. Osuga D.T. Feeney R.E. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 28Fields R. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Concentration-response curves were then obtained in cells containing varying GnRHR concentrations (Fig. 3). TNBS did not interfere with the capacity for the cells to mediate signal transduction, as demonstrated by the lack of effect of this treatment on the capacity of aluminum fluoride to stimulate PI hydrolysis (data not shown). Thus the increasing EC50 values and decreasing Emax observed with TNBS treatment reflects a decrease in GnRHR receptors/cell and allows a precise assessment of the effect of decreasing receptor expression on EC50. Prior exposure to TNBS at concentrations that decreased the maximal level of PI hydrolysis led to EC50 values of 2.4 ± 0.2 nM. Since this value is more than 100-fold lower than the EC50 obtained for the Gln121 receptor, the difference in the concentration-response curves observed cannot be attributed to altered receptor expression. These results demonstrate, therefore, that the affinity of agonist for the Gln121 mutant receptor is significantly reduced.Figure 3:Effect of varying receptor expression on PI hydrolysis dose-response relationships. COS-1 cells were transfected with the wild-type receptor DNA and exposed to TNBS at the concentrations indicated prior to obtaining the concentration-response curves for GnRH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Antagonist Binding Properties Suggest Differences from Agonist RecognitionThe effects of the Lys121 substitutions on antagonist binding were also investigated. The lack of [125I]GnRH-A binding to the Gln121 receptor prevented a direct measurement of its affinity for antagonist in competition binding. We have previously studied the expressed mouse GnRHR using radiolabeled antagonist(14Zhou W. Flanagan C.A. Ballesteros J. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar). Direct antagonist binding has not proven possible for the human receptor, presumably because antagonist binding is associated with high levels of nonspecific binding, and the relatively low levels of expression (and thus specific binding) obtained with expression of the human receptor hinder direct assay with radiolabeled antagonist. Therefore, a Schild analysis was performed, which allows the determination of antagonist affinity from the functional response(20Arunlakshana O. Schild H.O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1959; 14: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4270) Google Scholar). Whereas agonists have a low affinity for the Gln121 receptor, the affinity of antagonist is comparably high for the Gln121, Arg121, and wild-type receptors (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Thus, in contrast to high affinity agonist binding, which appears to require a positive charge at this position, antagonist binding is not sensitive to this locus of the receptor. Such a distinction of GnRHR binding sites for agonists and antagonists is consistent with a recent photoaffinity-labeling study of the GnRH receptor, which suggests that agonists and antagonists are oriented differently in the receptor(29Janovick J.A. Haviv F. Fitzpatrick T.D. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 942-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Figure 4:Blockade by antagonist of GnRH stimulation of PI hydrolysis by the wild-type GnRHR (panels A and C) and Gln121 mutant receptor (panels B and D).

Flanagan C.A. del Milton R.C. King J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21007-21013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously found that an acidic residue in the third extracellular loop of the GnRH receptor is required for this selectivity for mammalian Arg8-GnRH(31Flanagan C.A. Becker I.L. Davidson J.S. Wakefield I.K. Zhou W. Sealfon S.C. Millar R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22636-22641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of having an acidic residue at this position, however, is smaller for constrained GnRH agonist analogs like GnRH-A. Thus, substitution of Gln for Glu301 in the mouse GnRH receptor induces a 50-fold decrease in the affinity for GnRH but only a 4-5 fold change in the affinity for GnRH-A. These results are consistent with the presence of different, although presumably overlapping, binding sites for different classes of agonists. The binding site of GnRH requires an acidic residue in the third extracellular loop, whereas the binding site of GnRH-A has minimal involvement of this locus. Agonist interaction sites that play a fundamental role in positioning the pharmacophore for receptor activation or in transmitting the activation itself are likely to be conserved among all agonist classes. Because both GnRH activity and GnRH-A activity require a positive charge at Lys121, interaction with this site is likely to play a crucial role in receptor activation. Taken together, these considerations identify at least three types of determinants for ligand-receptor interaction: residues required for antagonist binding, residues required for binding of certain agonists, and residues involved in binding of all agonists. Clarification of the role of various receptor loci in ligand interaction should facilitate the understanding of the mechanism of agonist activation of the receptor.The Role of the 121 Locus in GnRHR in Determining the Nature and Consequences of Interactions with LigandsWith mutation of the ligand docking site, the effects of each mutation must correlate with the altered energy of interaction arising from the side chain properties of the amino acids introduced. Analysis of this correlation in the present study provides insight into the nature of the interaction between GnRH and the residue at position 121. A basic amino acid, either Lys or Arg, is required for high affinity agonist binding, yet a direct ionic interaction can be excluded by the lack of a suitable counterion on the ligand. The results, however, are consistent with a hydrogen bond interaction. Both Lys and Arg are strong hydrogen bond donors(32Jeffrey G.A. Saenger W. Hydrogen Bonding in Biological Structures. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991Crossref Google Scholar). The presence of the weaker hydrogen bond donor Gln at this position would reduce the strength of this interaction and lead to the decreased agonist affinity observed. The Leu and Asp mutant receptors lack hydrogen bond donors at this position, and both demonstrate no detectable agonist binding or coupling. The results are therefore consistent with a charge-strengthened hydrogen bond as the underlying mechanism for Lys121 to interact with GnRH. Because Lys121 contributes to the high affinity of agonists but not antagonists, a limited number of candidate hydrogen bond acceptors in GnRH can be proposed. Structure-activity studies of GnRH have indicated the importance of His2 and Trp3 for agonist activity(13Karten M. Rivier J.E. Endocr. Rev. 1986; 7: 44-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), and these two residues, therefore, represent the best candidates for interacting with Lys121. In forming the hydrogen bond, Lys121 could interact with the electron-dense aromatic rings of His2 or Trp3, the type of interaction postulated to be responsible for the binding of the nonpeptide antagonist CP96345 to the substance P receptor(33Fong T.M. Cascieri M.A. Yu H. Bansal A. Swain C. Strader C.D. Nature. 1993; 362: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Lys121 may hydrogen bond to the polar imino group of His2. Further molecular modeling and experimental studies should allow the precise site of interaction on GnRH to be determined.The two potential contact sites between GnRH and the receptor identified to date, Lys121 and Glu301, have similarities in their tolerance for variability at each position. In both cases little alteration in affinity is induced by substitution with a similarly charged residue. The Glu in extracellular loop 3 of the mouse GnRHR, which is involved in high affinity GnRH binding, can be replaced by an Asp with little effect on receptor affinity(31Flanagan C.A. Becker I.L. Davidson J.S. Wakefield I.K. Zhou W. Sealfon S.C. Millar R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22636-22641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the Arg121 substitution, presenting the hydrogen bond donor group at either ε or η positions that can mimic the ζ position of the group in Lys, gives comparable affinity. In either locus of the GnRHR, substitution by Gln significantly decreases GnRH affinity. Thus alterations in the length of the side chain of charged residues in TMH 3 and in the third extracellular loop are both well tolerated, suggesting flexibility in the spatial constraints for the binding interaction.In contrast to affinity, the receptor activation mechanism may be sensitive to the length of the side chain at position 121. Thus, the maximal level of GnRH-stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation obtained with expression of the Arg121 receptor was significantly higher than that generated by the wild-type receptor in all experiments (paired two-tailed t test, p < .05, n = 5 experiments). Expression of the Gln121 receptor led to a lower maximal stimulation. Because the Gln121 receptor was undetectable in radioligand binding, the possibility that the reduction in Emax was due to a lower level of expression of this receptor cannot be definitively excluded. In the case of the Arg121 construct, however, the higher level of stimulation was accompanied by a reduction in the level of receptor expression, suggesting that the activated state of the Arg121 receptor is more efficient at G protein coupling than the activated wild-type receptor. A qualitatively similar effect of side chain length on efficacy was observed in the β-adrenergic receptor. Asp113, which is located at a position homologous to that of Lys121 in the GnRHR, serves as the counterion for binding of the catecholamine head group of the ligand. Substitution of Glu at this position led to the development of partial agonist activity from antagonists for the wild-type β-adrenergic receptor(34Strader C.D. Candelore M.R. Hill W.S. Dixon R.A. Sigal I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16470-16477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the GnRHR, replacing Lys121 with Arg leads to an augmentation of the efficiency of signal transduction by GnRH. In both receptors, altering the length of this charged side chain leads to an alteration of measured drug efficacy. This similarity between a neurotransmitter and a peptide receptor suggests that the interaction with this locus can contribute to activation, possibly by serving to position the component of the ligand that triggers the receptor.We have identified a transmembrane domain site in the GnRHR that is specifically involved in docking GnRH agonists. We have previously provided evidence for the proximity of specific side chains in helix 2 and helix 7 (14Zhou W. Flanagan C.A. Ballesteros J. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar) and have proposed another site of GnRH docking in the third extracellular domain(31Flanagan C.A. Becker I.L. Davidson J.S.

This study provides insight into the structure of the receptor and of the GnRH binding site. The results obtained constitute a useful basis for extending and refining an experimentally testable model of the structure of the receptor-hormone complex that will make possible the elucidation of the molecular dynamics of receptor activation.

Rivier J.E. Endocr. Rev. 1986; 7: 44-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In contrast to some other peptides such as the tachykinins and cholecystokinin, for which small nonpeptide analogs have been identified, all GnRHR ligands reported thus far are peptides. Delineation of the precise contact sites between GnRH and its receptor is critical for developing an understanding of the relationship of the GnRHR binding pocket to that of other neurotransmitter and peptide receptors and for determining the molecular mechanisms underlying receptor activation. Ultimately this insight may lead to the design of novel GnRHR ligands.We have previously reported that a mutation in TMH 7 of the GnRHR restored binding, which had been eliminated by a mutation in TMH 2 (14Zhou W. Flanagan C.A. Ballesteros J. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar). The revertant character of mutations at these loci suggested that these two sites are in spatial proximity, a hypothesis that facilitated the refinement of a preliminary three-dimensional model of the receptor helix bundle constructed according to a set of integrated methods (15Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). This receptor model predicts that Lys121, located in the third TMH, is positioned in the ligand binding pocket of the receptor and would be accessible to GnRH. Lys121 is found in all six cloned mammalian GnRH receptors at a locus that corresponds to the position of the conserved Asp of the cationic amine receptors (Asp113 in the β-adrenergic receptor), a residue required for high affinity neurotransmitter binding(12Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 16Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Candelore M.R. Rands E. Hill W. Dixon R.A.F. J.

In order to investigate the role of Lys121 in ligand binding and activation of the GnRHR, a series of mutations was introduced at this position, and the resulting receptors were expressed and characterized in COS-1 cells. The results identify the role of charge-augmented hydrogen bonding at this position for the affinity of agonists but not antagonists."

Although both the 72-kDa (MMP-2) and the 92-kDa (MMP-9) type IV collagenases have similar substrate specificities(2Collier I.E. Wilhelm S.M. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Seltzer J.L.

Correspondingly, their 5′-flanking regions that have been reported to date bear few similarities(4Huhtala P. Chow L.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol.

In most cases, the synthesis of MMP-2 by non-transformed or tumor cell lines is constitutive in nature, at least in terms of responsiveness to phorbol esters, inflammatory cytokines, and transforming growth factor-β. The lack of responsiveness to such reagents has been attributed to the absence of AP1, PEA3, TIE, and other regulatory sequences within the 5′-flanking region of the MMP-2 gene. These elements are commonly found within the flanking regions of other members of this gene family(7Gaire M. Magbanua Z. McDonnell S. McNeil L. Lovett D.H. Matrisian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2032-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, tissue-specific and developmentally related control of MMP-2 clearly exists in vivo and in some in vitro experimental systems. For example, MMP-2 is highly expressed in the developing murine lung and kidney, with minimal expression in bone, or the central nervous system (8Reponen P. Sahlberg C. Huhtala P. Hurskainen T. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7856-7862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon completion of organ development, MMP-2 expression is minimal. Monocytic cells also show evidence for differentiation-specific expression of this enzyme, as progression toward a macrophage phenotype is associated with inducible MMP-2 synthesis(9Garbisa S.

MMP-2 is a key component of the basal turnover of the renal glomerular basement membrane(11Lovett D.H. Johnson R.J. Marti H.-P. Martin J. Davies M. Couser W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 85-98PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, enhanced synthesis of MMP-2 during glomerular inflammatory disorders plays a major role in the evolution of the disturbances of renal glomerular extracellular matrix structure and function that are characteristic of these disorders(11Lovett D.H. Johnson R.J. Marti H.-P. Martin J. Davies M. Couser W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 85-98PubMed Google Scholar, 12Marti H.P. Lee L. Kashgarian M. Lovett D.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 82-94PubMed Google Scholar). In recent studies we have demonstrated that glomerular mesangial cell regulation of MMP-2 synthesis exhibits a number of unique features, including stimulation by interleukin-1/tumor necrosis factor, transforming growth factor-β, phorbol esters, and cAMP analogs(12Marti H.P. Lee L. Kashgarian M. Lovett D.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 82-94PubMed Google Scholar, 13Marti H.P. McNeil L. Davies M. Martin J. Lovett D.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Given this distinguishing pattern of regulation, we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of the proximal 5′-flanking region of the rat MMP-2 gene within several distinctive cellular contexts. The current study demonstrates that a complex pattern of cell type-specific regulation of MMP-2 synthesis occurs, which involves cell type-specific cooperative interactions between a strong enhancer element and the proximal promoter of this gene. A rat λDASHII genomic library (Stratagene) was screened with a 250-bp cDNA probe that represented the 5′ proximal end of the cloned rat MMP-2(13Marti H.P. McNeil L. Davies M. Martin J. Lovett D.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Library screening and analysis of phage clones were performed using standard methodology. Two overlapping phage clones, 12.1.3 and 18.2.3, were obtained and restriction-mapped using partial digestion with BglII, KpnI, and PstI, followed by Southern blot analysis with oligonucleotide probes for the 5′ and 3′ ends of the genomic insert. A 6-kb KpnI-NotI fragment containing 500 bp of the second intron and 1686 bp of the 5′-flanking region was subcloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene) and sequenced using a Sequenase version 2 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and synthetic oligonucleotide primers synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. The subcloned 6-kb KpnI-NotI fragment was used as a template to prepare a series of 5′-flanking region reporter constructs in the promoterless luciferase expression vector, pGL2-Basic (Promega). The 5′ PCR primers included a KpnI site; the 3′ PCR primers included a BglII site to permit directional subcloning into the polylinker region of pGL2-Basic. Initial constructs included sequences extending 1686, 1007, 537, 383, 321, 267, and 239 bp 5′ relative to the translational start site. Further fine mapping of enhancer activity was performed by the preparation of sequential deletion constructs extending from bp 1686 to bp 1181 5′. To assess enhancer activity in the context of a fixed heterologous promoter, fragment −1342 to −1262 bp was subcloned in a normal and reversed orientation into the expression vector pGL2-Promoter (Promega), which contains a heterologous SV40 core promoter 5′ to the luciferase coding region. To assess distance relationships, the same fragment was subcloned into a BamHI site of the pGL2-Promoter vector, which was located 2000 bp from the SV40 promoter. To study intrinsic MMP-2 promoter activities within the context of a heterologous enhancer, sections of the proximal MMP-2 promoter extending from the translational start site to −239 to −383 bp were subcloned into the pGL2-Basic vector, which also contained the 550-bp CMV immediate/early enhancer. As a positive control the CMV enhancer was also subcloned into the BamHI site of the pGL2-Promoter vector.

Lipofectin (10 μl) was diluted in 90 μl of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% NU serum and mixed with 1 μg of purified plasmid DNA. As control for transfection efficiency, the vector pRSV-βGal was used at 2.5 μg/100 μl of transfection mixture. The DNA-liposome mixtures were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, after which 800 μl of NU serum-containing medium was added. Cells at 60-70% confluence on six-well culture plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and 1 ml of the liposome mixture was added/well. After incubation for 18 h at 37°C, the liposome mixture was removed and replaced with normal culture medium. Cells were harvested after another 24-h incubation period.

A 1 M potassium chloride-containing buffer was used for extraction, and the resultant proteins were dialyzed overnight in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mM potassium chloride, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The experiments were carried out according to Carthew et al.(20Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Synthetic or PCR-derived oligonucleotides were digested with BglII and the resultant overhanging 5′ ends filled in with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) by means of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Binding reactions included 1 × 104 cpm of labeled DNA in a 12.5-μl reaction mixture containing 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 300 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 20% glycerol, and 5 μg of nuclear extract in dialysis buffer. After 15 min at 30°C, the samples were loaded onto a pre-electrophoresed 4% polyacrylamide (40:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide), 15% glycerol gel which was polymerized on Gelbond (FMC) and electrophoresed in a buffer containing 1 × Tris borate-EDTA. Electrophoresis was conducted at 35 mA for 2.5 h. The gels were air-dried and autoradiographed. For competition experiments, unlabeled DNA fragments were added in 5-500 M excess to the reaction mixture. DNA fragments were prepared either by direct synthesis or by PCR(21Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R.G. Horn G.T. Mullis K.S. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13471) Google Scholar). After synthesis, oligonucleotides were purified by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gels, eluted, and precipitated with ethanol. Equimolar quantities annealed to form the final product. Restriction enzyme recognition sites were included at each end to allow labeling by digestion and fill-in with labeled nucleotides using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. Labeled fragments were purified on non-denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels. Poly(A)+ RNA (5 μg/lane) from confluent rat MC, confluent and subconfluent rat GEC, and non-stimulated and PMA (10−7M) differentiated U937 cells were electrophoresed an a 1.0% denaturing agarose gel and transferred to nylon membranes. A 2.7-kb rat MMP-2 cDNA insert (13Marti H.P. McNeil L. Davies M. Martin J. Lovett D.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was labeled by random hexamer priming with [α-32P]dCTP. As a normalization control, a full-length human β-actin cDNA probe was used. Hybridization was performed under standard conditions, followed by a high stringency wash in 1% SDS, 0.1 × SSC at 65°C for 60 min. The oligonucleotide probe for footprinting was prepared by digestion of construct pT4-Luc 1342P with Asp 718, which created a 5′ overhang at the KpnI site of the non-coding strand. The overhang was filled in with an excess of [α-32P]dGTP (6000 Ci/mmol) using Klenow fragment, thereby resulting in an end-labeled coding strand. Labeling was followed by BglII digestion and the mixture was loaded on a 8% polyacrylamide gel (40:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) for separation of the 80-bp insert from the vector. After electrophoresis the gel was exposed to Kodak XAR-2 film for 1 min, and the labeled 80-bp fragment was cut out, extracted from the gel piece with 0.5 M ammonium acetate for 3 h, and ethanol-precipitated overnight. The DNA-protein mixture was prepared as described for the gel retardation assay, but 105 cpm of the probe were used per reaction. After incubation for 15 min at 30°C, 2 μl of a 1:10 dimethyl sulfate solution were added for 30 s and the reaction was terminated by addition of 2 μl of 1 M dithiothreitol(22Starr D.B. Hawley D.K. Cell. 1991; 67: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The samples were then separated by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (40:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide). The gel was exposed to a Kodak XAR-2 film for 10 min, and the shifted and non-shifted bands were identified and excised. Methylated DNA was extracted with 0.5 M ammonium acetate for 3 h and precipitated overnight with ethanol at −80°C after a phenol/chloroform extraction. The dried pellets were resuspended in 45 μl of H2O and incubated with 5 μl of 10 M piperidine for 30 min at 90°C to cleave the DNA. The reaction was precipitated with ethanol and 125 μg/ml tRNA overnight at −80°C and extensively dried under vacuum. Thereafter the cleaved DNA was resuspended in 10 μl of 80% formamide and 0.2% bromphenol blue. Equivalent amounts of radioactivity of the shifted and non-shifted DNA were loaded onto a 8% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea, TBE sequencing gel. The gel was electrophoresed at 65 watts constant power until the dye reached the lower third of the gel, then transferred to Whatman No. 3MM paper, dried under vacuum and heat, and exposed to a Kodak XAR-2 film with an intensifying screen overnight at − 80°C. Fifteen micrograms of poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from mesangial cells and hybridized with 2 pmol of a 35-mer oligonucleotide, which was end-labeled using polynuclotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol). The primer was designed to hybridize to the predicted MMP-2 transcript ≈100 nucleotides 3′ to the analogous human MMP-2 mRNA transcription start site. The primer was extended using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase by standard techniques. The products were resolved on an 8% acrylamide, 7 M urea sequencing gel. A sequencing ladder was prepared using the same labeled oligonucleotide to sequence a plasmid containing the genomic clone with the predicted start site. It was resolved on the same gel used for the primer extension products. The assembled sequence was compared with the Transcription Factor Database version 7.3 (23Ghosh D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2091-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using the Quest program of IntelliGenetics Suite (IntelliGenetics, Mountain View, CA), or using the FASTA program(41Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9377) Google Scholar). For the initial investigation of the 5′ regulatory region of the rat MMP-2 gene, a 17-kb clone (clone 12.1.3) was isolated from a rat λ phage genomic library using a cDNA probe that hybridized within exon 1. Restriction mapping of clone 12.1.3 yielded a 6-kb KpnI-NotI fragment (NotI from the λDASHII vector), which extended from the second intron at the 3′ end, through exons 1 and 2, and included 1686 bp 5′ of the initiator methionine. The KpnI-NotI fragment was subcloned into pBluescript KS+ and sequenced. The sequence is shown in Fig. 1A, beginning 1686 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon. In contrast to other known members of the MMP supergene family, there were no TATA or CAAT boxes, as is the case with the human MMP-2 gene(1Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 4Huhtala P. Chow L.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2032-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further similarity with the human MMP-2 gene is manifested by the presence of two GC boxes (Sp1 binding sites) immediately adjacent to the putative transcriptional start site based on the human sequence. A potential AP-1 element was present within the first exon, whereas three AP-2-like elements, which differed from the consensus sequence (CCCCAGGC) by 2-3 nucleotides, were present within the 5′-flanking sequence. A 49-bp potential Z-DNA sequence was also present(24Nordheim A. Rich A. Nature. 1983; 303: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 25Schroth G.P. Chou P.J. Ho P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11846-11855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and five γ-interferon response elements were identified within this region. A comparison with the limited human MMP-2 5′-flanking sequence (4Huhtala P. Chow L.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11077-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed a high degree of homology with approximately 65% nucleotide identity (Fig. 1B). Within the sequence encompassing the major and minor transcriptional start site of the human sequence, there is 100% homology to the rat MMP-2 sequence. Primer extension analysis of rat mesangial cell mRNA mapped two transcription start sites at −264 and −274 relative to the translation start site. These located in an identical region to those found in the human gene, except that the 5′-untranslated region of the human mRNA is 27 nucleotides longer. An AP-2-like element is found in the 5′-flanking sequence of the rat promoter region, whereas an AP-2-like site is present within the first exon of the human MMP-2 gene. No AP-1 sequences are present within the limited human sequence, whereas the rat sequence reveals a potential binding region within the first exon. To identify the sequence requirements for MMP-2 gene transcription by rat MC, cells were transiently transfected with a set of 5′ deletion constructs, which contained variable lengths of upstream sequence subcloned into a promoterless luciferase expression vector (Fig. 2A). Co-transfection with a β-galactosidase-expressing plasmid was performed to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency. A moderate increase in luciferase activity was observed with constructs increasing in length up to 1007 bp. With construct pT4-Luc 1686, which contains the whole 5′ sequence of the original KpnI-NotI restriction fragment, a major increment in transcription activity was obtained. This suggested that an important cis-regulatory element is present within this part of the sequence. Therefore, in a second set of 5′ deletion constructs, a stepwise removal of the 5′ end of construct pT4-Luc 1686 was carried out and these constructs were also transfected into rat MC (Fig. 2B). High luciferase expression was achieved with constructs that lack up to 344 bp of the 5′ end (construct pT4-Luc 1342). Further removal of another 80 bp resulted in a loss of about 80% of luciferase activity (construct pT4-Luc 1262). As described, the removal of an 80-bp fragment spanning −1262 bp to −1342 bp of the 5′ regulatory region abolished more than 80% of transcription activity from luciferase construct pT4-Luc 1342. When this 80-bp region was cloned into the luciferase vector pGL2-Promoter upstream of a heterologous SV40 promoter, it was found to enhance transcription 4-fold (Fig. 3). We demonstrated orientation and position independence by subcloning this 80-bp fragment into the luciferase plasmid with the SV40 core promoter in the opposite orientation adjacent to the promoter (construct pT4-Luc 1342PI) and in the correct orientation at a distance of approximately 2000 bp upstream from the promoter (construct pT4-Luc 1342PD). Compared to the construct pT4-Luc 1342P that contains the 80-bp fragment in the correct orientation next to the SV40 promoter, constructs pT4-Luc 1342PI and pT4-Luc 1342PD show similar levels of luciferase expression. These data indicate that the 80-bp fragment behaves with characteristic enhancer properties. Notably, the 80-bp sequence immediately 3′ to this region (construct pT4-Luc 1262P) demonstrated no transcriptional enhancing activity. Gel mobility shift analysis was performed with nuclear extracts from MC to identify protein-interaction(s) with the 80-bp fragment pT4-1342P enhancer. Fig. 4 shows a gel shift assay carried out with this fragment radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Fragment pT4-1342P and also the immediate 5′ fragment pT4-1262 were used as non-radioactive competitors in 0.1-100-fold molar excess. In the presence of mesangial nuclear extract the mobility of the radiolabeled 80-bp fragment is significantly retarded (lane2) and reveals a major DNA-protein complex compared to the mobility of the unbound DNA fragment alone (lane1). Specificity of this interaction is demonstrated in lanes 3-6, where addition of increasing amounts of cold fragment pT4-1342P to the DNA-nuclear extract mixture successfully competes for the binding protein(s), resulting in the disappearance of the shifted band. The specificity of this DNA-protein interaction is further confirmed by the fact that a different non-radioactive fragment (pT4-1262P) was unable to compete for protein binding (lanes 7-9). Additional minor shifting bands were evident but not investigated further because of the very small fraction of probe shifted. A second gel shift analysis was performed for the further mapping of the 80-bp enhancer element (Fig. 5). In this experiment, overlapping 40-bp competitor subfragments of the 80-bp fragment pT4-1342P were used in 50-fold molar excess as outlined in the legend of Fig. 5. We observed a distinct pattern of competition for nuclear protein using these unlabeled 40-bp competitor fragments. Lane 1 shows the gel shift of the radiolabeled fragment pT4-1342P and lane 2 the specific competition with the cold 80-bp fragment. Although fragment pT4-1342A-P, which spans the 5′ 40 bp of pT4-1342P, does not compete for the major binding protein(s) (lane 4), fragment pT4-1342B-P, which corresponds to the middle 40 bp of pT4-1342P, competes successfully for protein(s) in the major shifted band (lane 6). Fragment pT4-1342C-P, the 3′ 40-bp region of pT4-1342P, reveals no competition for the major protein(s) (lane 8). Lanes 3, 5, and 7 serve as controls without competitor DNA. These data localize the major gel binding region of the 80-bp fragment pT4-1342P is contained within the 40-bp subsequence pT4-1342B-P. Transfection studies in MC demonstrated that the subsequence of 1342B-P (bp −1322 to −1282), when subcloned into the luciferase expression vector with the heterologous promoter, manifested all the enhancer activity contained within the original 80-bp segment (Fig. 6).Figure 6:Transient expression of pGL2-Promoter constructs pT4-Luc 1262P and pT4-Luc 1342P (both containing 80-bp inserts) and pT4-Luc 1342A-P and pT4-Luc 1342B-P (both containing 40-bp subsequences of the 80-bp fragment) in MC.

The footprinted region is extends over 26 bp and contains a 11-bp palindromic segment (marked by a line). The sequence involved in specific DNA-protein interaction does not correspond on a search of the Transcription Factor Database version 7.3 to recognition elements of any known transcription factors. Finer mapping of the 40-bp sequence of pT4-1342B-P, which contained both DNA binding and transcriptional activity, was performed by regional mutation of the sequence. Three mutant 40-bp sequences were prepared from complimentary oligonucleotides, each containing 9 non-complementary mutated bases (underlined) in different regions of the 40-bp sequence (see Fig. 8A for exact locations). Pyrimidines were replaced by their non-complementary purines and vice versa.

The growth of E. coli CAG2242 in the defined M9 medium was normal in the presence and absence of 0.5 mM spermidine. However, cell viability of E. coli CAG2242 at 48 h after the onset of growth decreased greatly by the addition of 0.5 mM spermidine. The amount of spermidine accumulated in the cells was approximately 3-fold that in the cells grown in the absence of spermidine. Transformation of the cloned speG gene to E. coli CAG2242 recovered the cell viability. Decrease in cell viability of E. coli CAG2242 was observed even when 0.5 mM spermidine was added at 24 h after the onset of growth. The results indicate that accumulated spermidine functions at the late stationary phase of growth. The accumulation of spermidine caused a decrease in protein synthesis but not in DNA and RNA synthesis at 28 h after the onset of growth. The synthesis of several kinds of proteins was particularly inhibited. They included ribosome modulation factor and OmpC protein. Since the ribosome modulation factor is essential for cell viability at the stationary phase of growth (Yamagishi, M., Matsushima, H., Wada, A., Sakagami, M., Fujita, N., and Ishihama, A.(1993) EMBO J. 12, 625-630), the decrease in the protein was thought to be one of the reasons for the decrease in cell viability. The decrease in the ribosome modulation factor mainly occurred at the translational level.

The decrease in the ribosome modulation factor mainly occurred at the translational level. Polyamines, aliphatic cations present in almost all living organisms, are known to be necessary for normal cell growth(1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar, 2Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 81-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to understand the mechanism by which the cellular polyamine concentration is regulated. Polyamine content is regulated by biosynthesis, degradation, uptake, and excretion. Although a rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine degradation in eukaryotes, spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase, has been recently studied in detail(4Casero R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 656: 653-661Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar), that in prokaryotes, spermidine acetyltransferase (SAT), 1The abbreviations used are: SATspermidine acetyltransferaseRMFribosome modulation factorHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographySPDspermidine. has not. In eukaryotes, spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase is induced strongly in the presence of polyamines (5Persson L. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12364-12367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bis(ethyl)polyamine derivatives(6Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and it probably plays an important role in the decrease in polyamine toxicity by its accumulation(7He Y. Kashiwagi K. Fukuchi J. Terao K. Shirahata A. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Poulin R. Coward J.K. Lakanen J.R. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4690-4698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, spermidine acetylation increased in response to high pH (9Dubin D.T. Rosenthal S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 776-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cold shock(10Tabor C.W. Dobbs L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2086-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but SAT activity did not change significantly under these conditions(11Carper S.W. Willis D.G. Manning K.A. Gerner E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12439-12441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To help understand the characteristics of polyamine degradation in E. coli, we purified SAT and isolated the gene for SAT (speG)(12Fukuchi J. Kashiwagi K. Takio K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22581-22585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that SAT is present in very small amounts in cells and increases only by 2.5-3.5-fold under poor nutrient conditions. In this study, the physiological functions of spermidine acetyltransferase in E. coli were studied with E. coli CAG2242 (speG) and the cloned speG gene. We found that the accumulated spermidine due to the lack of SAT caused a decrease in cell viability at the stationary phase of growth through its inhibition of protein synthesis. The synthesis of several kinds of proteins was particularly inhibited. The decrease in cell viability paralleled the decrease in ribosome modulation factor (RMF), which is essential for cell viability(13Yamagishi M. Matsushima H. Wada A. Sakagami M. Fujita N. Ishihama A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). RMF is a protein associated with 100 S ribosome dimers (14Wada A. Yamazaki Y. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2657-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and is synthesized during transition from exponential growth to the stationary phase(13Yamagishi M. Matsushima H. Wada A. Sakagami M. Fujita N. Ishihama A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We also recently found that RMF is a stationary phase-specific inhibitor of protein synthesis and that 100 S ribosome dimers are dormant forms of ribosomes. 2A. Wada, K. Igarashi, S. Yoshimura, S.

E. coli C600 (supE44, hsdR, thi, thr, leu, lacY1, tonA21) and CAG2242 (speG, supE44, hsdR, thi, thr, leu, lacY1, tonA21), provided by Dr. E. W. Gerner (University of Arizona Health Sciences Center), were grown in M9 medium (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

To obtain pMWSAT, the 1.3-kilobase BamHI-EcoRI fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using pSAT2 (12Fukuchi J. Kashiwagi K. Takio K. Igarashi K. J. Biol.

The primers used for polymerase chain reaction were 5′-d(AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA)-3′ (24-mer) and 5′-d(CCGAATTCCGCAGTGGATGGTGT)-3′ (23-mer). The 1.3-kilobase BamHI-EcoRI fragments treated with BamHI and EcoRI were then inserted into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pMW119, a low copy number of plasmid(16Yamaguchi K. Masamune Y. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1985; 200: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). E. coli CAG2242 transformed with pMWSAT or pMW119 was grown in the presence of ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Cell growth was followed by measuring absorbance at 540 nm. Cell viability was determined by counting colony numbers in aliquots of the culture grown on LB-containing 1.5% agar plates (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 440-442Google Scholar) at 37°C. Polyamine levels in E. coli were determined by HPLC as previously described (17Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Hamasaki H. Miura A. Kakegawa T. Hirose S. Matsuzaki S. J.

Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli CAG2242 cells (1 ml) were cultured in the presence and absence of 0.5 mM spermidine. At 12 or 28 h after the onset of cell growth, cells were labeled with 222 kBq of [3H]thymidine (0.9 μM), 74 kBq of [3H]uridine (1 μM), or 92.5 kBq of [35S]methionine (30 μM). For measurement of [3H]thymidine and [3H]uridine incorporated into DNA and RNA, respectively, cold trichloroacetic acid insoluble radioactivity in 0.1-ml aliquots was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. For measurement of [35S]methionine incorporated into protein, hot trichloroacetic acid insoluble radioactivity was counted using 0.1-ml aliquots. Initiation factors (IF2 and 3) and ribosomal proteins (S1, L20, and L35) were prepared according to the previous publications(19Hershey J.W.B. Yanov J. Johnston K. Fakunding J.L. Arch. Biochem.

Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12316-12321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 30,000 × g supernatant of E. coli cells (5 A260 units) was loaded on a 5-ml linear sucrose gradient (5-20%) containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mM magnesium acetate, and 100 mM ammonium acetate. The tube was centrifuged for 80 min at 40,000 rpm in a Hitachi P55ST2. The sucrose gradients were fractionated into 31-33 tubes. Absorbance at 260 nm was measured after 4-fold dilution of each fraction. E. coli CAG2242 cells (0.5 ml) were cultured in the presence and absence of 0.5 mM spermidine. At 28 h after the onset of cell growth, cells were labeled with 7 MBq of [35S]methionine (30 μM) at 37°C for 30 min. Proteins synthesized (500,000 cpm) were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (24O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and fluorography(25Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 56: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (3036) Google Scholar). Primer extension was performed according to the method of McKnight and Kingsbury(26McKnight S.L. Kingsbury R. Science. 1982; 217: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides, which hybridize 10-28 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon AUG (primer 3 in (13Yamagishi M. Matsushima H. Wada A. Sakagami M. Fujita N. Ishihama A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)) and 75-95 nucleotides downstream from the initiation codon AUG of RMF mRNA (primer 4 in (13Yamagishi M. Matsushima H. Wada A. Sakagami M. Fujita N. Ishihama A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)), were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The 32P-labeled oligonucleotides were then hybridized with total RNA (50 μg) isolated from E. coli cells (27Emory S.A. Belasco J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4472-4481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to prime the synthesis of cDNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The product of this reaction was analyzed by electrophoresis on 5% acrylamide sequencing gel. Cells were labeled with [35S] methionine for 30 min as described above at the specified phases of growth. The amount of RMF synthesized was determined as previously described(22Kashiwagi K. Sakai Y. Igarashi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 500,000 cpm of [35S]methionine-labeled protein was treated with anti-RMF antiserum and then with 10% formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I cells (Calbiochem). Immunoprecipitated RMF was then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 13% acrylamide gel, and the protein was detected by fluorography. To clarify the physiological functions of SAT, a SAT-deficient mutant, E. coli CAG2242 cells, were grown in the presence and absence of 0.5 mM spermidine. As shown in Fig. 1A, cell growth of E. coli CAG2242 with or without spermidine was equal to that of E. coli C600 (parent strain). The effect of spermidine on cell viability was then examined (Fig. 1B). Cell viability of E. coli CAG2242 at 48 h after the onset of cell growth was decreased greatly by spermidine, but that of E. coli C600 was not. The transformant of E. coli CAG2242 with pMWSAT recovered cell viability. Next, polyamine contents in E. coli cells were measured (Fig. 2). When E. coli C600 cells were cultured in the presence of spermidine, spermidine accumulation was not observed. However, when E. coli CAG2242 cells were cultured in the presence of spermidine, spermidine accumulation was observed. The amount of spermidine accumulated in the cells was approximately 3-fold that in the cells grown in the absence of spermidine. The transformant of E. coli CAG2242 with pMWSAT did not cause the spermidine accumulation. The results strongly suggest that the accumulation of spermidine decreased the cell viability of E. coli cells. When macromolecular synthesis of the mutant CAG2242 cells was measured at 12 h after the onset of cell growth, DNA, RNA, and protein syntheses did not change significantly in the presence and absence of spermidine (Fig. 3). Macromolecular synthesis was then measured at 28 h after the onset of cell growth. DNA and RNA syntheses decreased greatly, but the accumulated spermidine had no effect on these two syntheses. Although protein synthesis did not decrease significantly in the absence of spermidine, it was greatly decreased by its presence (Fig. 3C). The results suggest that the syntheses of proteins necessary for cell viability are inhibited by spermidine. Since protein synthesis was inhibited by 80% by spermidine, the proteins synthesized were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis to examine whether the synthesis of all proteins was equally inhibited by spermidine. Proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine at 28 h after the onset of cell growth, and the same amount of radioactivity (500,000 cpm) was used for electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 4, the syntheses of some specific proteins (No. 1-3) were particularly repressed by spermidine. Since the protein termed No. 1 was identified as OmpC protein (outer membrane protein) by comparison with the protein analysis of the OmpC protein-deficient mutant KY2201(28Sato T. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 88-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether cell viability of the mutant at 24 and 48 h after the onset of cell growth decreased or not. However, there was no significant difference in cell viability between E. coli C600 and the OmpC protein-deficient mutant KY2201 cells (data not shown). The other two proteins (No. 2 and 3) have not been identified yet. Next, the ribosomal proteins and their associated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting because of the strong inhibition of protein synthesis by spermidine (Fig. 5). The amounts of ribosomal proteins S1, L20, and L35 (21Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 911: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 29Wada A. Sako T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in E. coli CAG2242 grown in the presence of 0.5 mM spermidine were nearly equal to those in E. coli CAG2242 grown in its absence. There were also no significant differences in the amounts of initiation factors 2 and 3. However, the amount of RMF, which is essential for cell viability(13Yamagishi M. Matsushima H. Wada A. Sakagami M. Fujita N. Ishihama A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), decreased greatly in the cells grown in the presence of spermidine. When Western blot analysis was performed using the 30,000 × g supernatant instead of ribosome-associated proteins, essentially the same results were obtained (data not shown). The results indicate that the amounts of ribosomal proteins and initiation factors in E. coli CAG2242 grown in the presence and absence of spermidine are nearly equal and the amount of RMF decreased greatly in the cells cultured with spermidine. Since RMF is a stationary phase-specific inhibitor of protein synthesis and forms temporarily inactive 100 S ribosome dimers (14Wada A. Yamazaki Y. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2657-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar),2 ribosome patterns were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 6, the relative amount of 100 S ribosome dimers decreased greatly in E. coli CAG2242 cells grown in the presence of spermidine. At 44 h after the onset of cell growth, there were no 100 S dimers in the spermidine- accumulated cells, and the amount of ribosomes (30, 50, and 70 S) decreased greatly. These results suggest that RMF is not only a stationary phase-specific inhibitor of protein synthesis but also an anti-degradation factor of ribosomes. RMF is known to be synthesized at the stationary phase (13Yamagishi M. Matsushima H. Wada A. Sakagami M. Fujita N. Ishihama A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether spermidine functions at the late stationary phase. Even when spermidine was added at 24 h after the onset of cell growth, cell viability decreased greatly at 48 h (Fig. 7). However, the decrease in cell viability was delayed compared with that of cells cultured with spermidine at the onset of cell growth (Fig. 1B). Ribosome patterns and the amount of RMF were analyzed at 32 and 44 h after the onset of cell growth. As shown in Fig. 8, only small amounts of 100 S ribosome dimers and RMF existed in the 30,000 × g supernatant at 44 h, indicating that the accumulated spermidine was operational at the late stationary phase.Figure 8:Effects of spermidine added at the late stationary phase on ribosomal patterns (A) and the amount of RMF (B). Sucrose density gradient centrifugation and Western blot analysis of RMF were performed as described in the legends of Figure 5:, Figure 6:.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The molecular mechanism involved in the decrease in the amount of RMF was studied. The amount of RMF mRNA was first measured by primer extension (Fig. 9A). It was found that the amount of mRNA in the spermidine-accumulated cells was nearly equal to that in normal cells at 20 h, and it decreased slightly at 28 h after the onset of cell growth. Essentially the same results were obtained with Northern blot analysis (data not shown). Then, the synthesis of RMF was analyzed by immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled protein (500,000 cpm) with its antibody and S. aureus Cowan I cells. As shown in Fig. 9B, the amount of RMF synthesized in E. coli CAG2242 grown in the absence of spermidine was maximal at 20 h after the onset of cell growth, and this was much larger than the amounts synthesized in the cells grown in the presence of spermidine at 12, 20, and 28 h after the onset of cell growth. These results indicate that the amount of RMF accumulated in a 30-min labeling period diminished more rapidly than its mRNA level in the presence of spermidine. The physiological functions of SAT were examined in this study. We found that SAT is important for the maintenance of cell viability at the stationary phase of growth through the inhibition of spermidine accumulation. When SAT was deficient in E. coli cells, spermidine accumulating in the cells grown in the presence of 0.5 mM spermidine was approximately three times more than that in the cells grown in the absence of spermidine. In eukaryotic cells, accumulated polyamines and bis(ethyl)polyamines inhibited cell growth(7He Y. Kashiwagi K. Fukuchi J. Terao K. Shirahata A. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 30He Y. Suzuki T. Kashiwagi K. Kusama-Eguchi K. Shirahata A. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The inhibition of cell growth paralleled the inhibition of protein synthesis, especially of mitochondrial protein synthesis due to the existence of unstable tRNAs in mitochondria. In E. coli, however, the accumulated spermidine neither decreased the cell growth nor inhibited protein synthesis at the logarithmic phase of cell growth. At the stationary phase, the accumulated spermidine due to the lack of SAT started to inhibit protein synthesis and caused a decrease in cell viability. Since almost all kinds of protein synthesis were inhibited (Fig. 4), the amount of spermidine bound to ribosomes may increase at the stationary phase of growth and cause the inhibition of protein synthesis, which was observed in eukaryotic cells. Actually, the amount of ribosomes decreased at the stationary phase of growth. Accordingly, the relative amount of spermidine to ribosomes increased at the stationary phase of growth. These phenomena were recovered by the transformation of speG gene to SAT-deficient cells. The results clearly show that deficiency of SAT caused the accumulation of spermidine followed by the inhibition of protein synthesis and the decrease in cell viability. Among the proteins synthesized at the stationary phase, synthesis of OmpC protein and RMF was strongly inhibited by the accumulated spermidine. As expected, the inhibition of RMF synthesis mainly occurred at the translational level. We recently reported that most polyamines exist as a polyamine-RNA complex in cells and contribute to the stimulation of some kinds of protein synthesis under normal conditions(31Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Miyamoto S. Kashiwagi K. Ito K. Watanabe S. Igarashi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In other words, the degree of stimulation of protein synthesis by polyamines differs in each protein. In a eukaryotic cell-free system, we also reported that low concentrations of spermidine strongly stimulate protein synthesis directed by the mRNA having a GC-rich 5′-untranslated region and that high concentrations of spermidine inhibit the protein synthesis greatly (33Ito K. Kashiwagi K. Watanabe S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13036-13041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is presumed that the degree of inhibition of protein synthesis by the accumulated spermidine also differs in each protein. Our present results may be in accordance with the concept that the polyamine regulation of protein synthesis depends on the base composition of mRNA, that is, the tertiary structure of mRNA. Further studies will be necessary to provide a clear explanation for the late disappearance of RMF in cells accumulating spermidine. RMF is known to be essential for cell viability (13Yamagishi M. Matsushima H. Wada A. Sakagami M. Fujita N. Ishihama A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and is synthesized only at the stationary phase of growth. Accumulated spermidine also functions at the stationary phase (Fig. 7). A decrease in OmpC protein did not influence cell viability. It has been reported that the stationary phase sigma factor σS is also involved in cell viability(34McCann M.P. Kidwell J.P. Matin A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4188-4194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its synthesis is positively regulated by guanosine tetrasphosphate (ppGpp)(35Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Nguyen L.H. Jensen D.B. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7982-7989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of σS measured by Western blotting and of ppGpp measured by thin layer chromatography did not change significantly in the cells grown in the presence and absence of spermidine (data not shown). Thus, the decrease in RMF by the accumulated spermidine is probably the major reason for the decrease in cell viability. Although the rates of RMF synthesis were different in cells grown in the presence and absence of spermidine (Fig. 9), the amounts of RMF existing in the cells were nearly equal until 28 h after the onset of cell growth (Fig. 5). The reason for this remains to be clarified. It may be that excess amounts of RMF that cannot be bound to 100 S ribosome dimers are degraded rapidly. RMF is essential for cell viability at the stationary phase of growth (13Yamagishi M. Matsushima H. Wada A. Sakagami M. Fujita N. Ishihama A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), but we do not know yet how RMF is involved in cell viability. We suggest that RMF may function as an anti-degradation factor of ribosomes since the amount of ribosomes decreased greatly in the spermidine-accumulated cells harvested at 44 h after the onset of cell growth. However, the possibility that degradation of ribosomes may be the result of cell death can also not be ruled out at present. We thank Dr. E. W. Gerner for the kind gifts of E. coli C600 and CAG2242."

Previous results from this laboratory demonstrated that a preparation of mixed male germ cell types from mouse testis exhibited a lower temperature threshold for activation of HSF1 DNA binding relative to other mouse cell types (Sarge, K. D., Bray, A. E., and Goodson, M. L. (1995) Nature 374, 126). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the phenomenon of reduced HSF1 activation temperature is common to all testis cell types, both somatic and germ cell types, or whether it is a special property of male germ cells. The results show that a purified population of pachytene spermatocytes, one of the male germ cell types, exhibits a profile of reduced HSF1 activation temperature identical to that observed for the mixed germ cell preparation, with a threshold HSF1 activation temperature of 35°C. Activation of HSF1 DNA binding in male germ cells by incubation at 38°C is accompanied by the classic cellular stress response parameters of heat-induced HSF1 phosphorylation and increased expression of the hsp72 stress protein. In contrast, a preparation of somatic testis cell types exhibits HSF1 activation only at temperatures of 42°C and above, a profile identical to that observed for mouse liver cells and mammalian cell lines. These results demonstrate that the phenomenon of reduced HSF1 activation temperature is a unique property of male germ cell types within the mammalian testis and demonstrate that HSF1 activated at this lower temperature threshold is fully capable of mediating a productive cellular stress response in these cell types.

The stress-induced expression of hsps, called the cellular stress response, is mediated by heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1). HSF1 exists in unstressed cells in a monomeric non-DNA binding form, which is converted to the trimeric DNA binding form following exposure of cells to elevated temperature and other stress conditions (4Sarge K.D.

In most mammalian cell types, activation of HSF1 DNA binding occurs only at temperatures of 42°C and above. However, previous results from this laboratory showed that HSF1 activation temperature is not identical in all cell types within an organism. These results demonstrated that a preparation of mixed male germ cell types from mouse testis exhibited an HSF1 activation temperature that is significantly lower than that observed in mouse liver cells(12Sarge K.D. Bray A.E. Goodson M.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 126Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Two hypotheses can be put forward to explain the phenomenon of reduced HSF1 activation temperature in testis. The first possibility is that it is somehow related to the lower basal growth temperature experienced by cell types within this tissue. A unique feature of the male gonads of many species is their location outside the main body cavity, so that testis cells have a significantly lower growth temperature relative to cells of other tissues. In the mouse, testis temperature is tightly regulated at 30°C, 7°C lower than the body cavity temperature at which other tissues such as liver are maintained(13Harrison R.G. Weiner J.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1948; 107: 48PGoogle Scholar). Therefore, the lowered HSF1 activation temperature in male germ cells suggests the existence of a relationship between normal growth temperature and the temperature set point for HSF activation in a particular cell type (12Sarge K.D. Bray A.E. Goodson M.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 126Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This possibility is consistent with the hypothesis that HSF is not activated in response to absolute temperature experienced by the cell but rather in response to a change in temperature(14Abravaya K. Phillips B. Morimoto R.I. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 15Clos J. Rabindran R. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Nature. 1993; 364: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Liu A.Y.C. Bian H. Huang L.E. Lee Y.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14768-14775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second, alternative possibility is that reduced HSF1 activation temperature may have evolved as a unique property of male germ cells, somehow required for the normal function or development of these specialized cell types. The purpose of the present study was to discriminate between these two possibilities by comparing the temperature set point of HSF1 activation in the two major classes of cell types present in testis, the male germ cell types (represented by purified pachytene spermatocytes) and somatic cell types (interstitial somatic cell preparation). The results demonstrate that the phenomenon of reduced HSF1 activation temperature in testis is a property unique to male germ cell types within this tissue, as it is exhibited by pachytene spermatocytes but not by somatic testis cell types. HSF1 DNA binding is induced in somatic testis cell types at temperatures of 42°C and above, a temperature profile identical to that observed for mouse liver cells and mammalian cell lines(12Sarge K.D. Bray A.E. Goodson M.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 126Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Mosser D.D. Kotzbauer P.T. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3748-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In contrast, the threshold temperature for HSF1 activation in pachytene spermatocytes is 35°C, with maximal HSF1 DNA binding induced by treatment at 38°C. The results also show that incubation of male germ cells at 38°C results in heat-induced HSF1 phosphorylation and increased synthesis of the hsp72 stress protein, demonstrating the ability of HSF1 DNA binding activated at this lower temperature to mediate a productive cellular stress response. C3HF/SED mice were obtained from Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA) and maintained under a controlled light cycle (14 h light:10 h dark). These studies were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Pachytene spermatocytes were isolated by centrifugal elutriation of enzymatically dissociated testes of adult C3HF/SED strain mice. Testes of six mice were decapsulated by removal of the tunica albuginea and then placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 6 mM sodium L-lactate, 0.5 mg/ml collagenase, and 0.25 mg/ml trypsin. Enzymatic disruption of seminiferous tubules was carried out at 32°C for 30 min with gentle inversion mixing every 5 min. After allowing debris to settle, the supernatant was removed and the dissociated cells collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 3 min. Cells were then resuspended and subjected to elutriation as described previously(18Meistrich M.L. Longtin J. Brock W.A. Grimes S.R. Mace M.L. Biol. Reprod. 1981; 25: 1065-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). After elutriation, fractions containing pachytene spermatocytes were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 12 ml of DMEM containing 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 6 mM sodium L-lactate. The purity of the pooled pachytene spermatocytes was 86%, with the remaining cells consisting of round spermatids. For preparation of testis interstitial cells, decapsulated adult mouse testes were incubated in a DMEM enzymatic digestion solution identical to that described above for preparation of germ cells, except that trypsin was not added to this solution. In order to minimize contamination of the interstitial cells with germ cells, care was taken to gently tease the seminiferous tubules apart to avoid tearing them. After incubation at 32°C for 30 min with gentle inversion mixing every 5 min, seminiferous tubules were allowed to settle, and the dissociated interstitial cells in the supernatant were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 3 min and resuspended in DMEM. Microscopic examination of the interstitial cell preparation detected no apparent contamination with male germ cells. For heat treatment in vitro, interstitial cells or purified pachytene spermatocytes were incubated at various temperatures for 60 min and subjected to gel shift analysis as described below. In experiments examining heat-induced hsp expression in germ cells, the initial 60-min heat treatments were followed by incubation at 32°C for 120 min to allow cells to recover and synthesize hsps. Whole cell extracts of pachytene spermatocytes and interstitial somatic testis cells were prepared by Dounce homogenization of cell pellets in 5 volumes of Buffer C (20 mM Hepes (7.9), 0.42 M NaCl, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation of the extract at 12,000 × g to pellet insoluble material, the native gel mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (4Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) with a self-complementary consensus HSE oligonucleotide (5′-CTAGAAGCTTCTAGAAGCTTCTAG-3′), which contains four perfect inverted 5′-NGAAN-3′ repeats after annealing. For experiments involving addition of antibodies, 1 μl of a 1:250 dilution of specific HSF1 or HSF2 polyclonal antibody was added to aliquots of extract and incubated at 22°C for 10 min before gel shift analysis. For Western blot analysis, mixed germ cells or purified pachytene spermatocytes were boiled in 2 × Laemmli buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 200 mM dithiothreitol), electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel, and then blotted to nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad semidry transfer apparatus. The blots were then probed with HSF1 polyclonal antibodies or 3a3 monoclonal antibody as described previously(4Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Previous results from this laboratory demonstrated that HSF1 DNA binding is induced at significantly lower temperatures in a preparation of mixed male germ cell types relative to other mouse cell types(12Sarge K.D. Bray A.E. Goodson M.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 126Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This result suggested the possibility that the growth temperature experienced by a particular cell type in vivo plays a primary role in determining the HSF1 activation temperature in that cell type. In order to directly test this hypothesis, the temperature profiles of HSF1 activation in purified preparations of different cell types present in the testis, both somatic and germ cell types, were determined. First, HSF1 activation temperature in male germ cells was examined, using a purified population of pachytene spermatocytes. Aliquots of the pachytene spermatocytes were incubated at various temperatures in vitro and then subjected to gel shift analysis using an oligonucleotide containing an HSF binding site. The results of this experiment, shown in Fig. 1A, indicate that these purified pachytene spermatocytes, like the preparation of mixed male germ cells examined previously(12Sarge K.D. Bray A.E. Goodson M.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 126Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), exhibit a reduced HSF1 activation temperature profile. Low levels of HSF1 DNA binding are induced by treatment at 36°C, with high levels at 38 and 40°C, followed by diminishing levels at 42 and 44°C. In order to precisely define the temperature profile for HSF1 activation in pachytene spermatocytes, a similar analysis was performed using a 1°C temperature course. The results, shown in Fig. 1B, indicate that the threshold temperature for HSF1 activation in these cells is approximately 35°C. Gel shift analysis in conjunction with polyclonal antibodies specific to the HSF1 and HSF2 polypeptides confirms that the HSF DNA binding activity induced in male germ cells by treatment at 38°C, like that induced in 42°C-treated human and mouse cell lines(4Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 5Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), is composed of HSF1 and not HSF2 (Fig. 1C). Next, the temperature profile for HSF1 activation in somatic cell types of mouse testis was determined. Heat treatment and gel shift analysis was performed on a preparation of mixed somatic testis cell types present in the interstitial space between the seminiferous tubules. The results of this analysis, shown in Fig. 2, demonstrate that these somatic testis cell types exhibit activation of HSF1 DNA binding at temperatures of 42°C and above, a profile very similar to that observed previously for mouse liver cells and mammalian cell lines(12Sarge K.D. Bray A.E. Goodson M.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 126Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Mosser D.D. Kotzbauer P.T. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3748-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results shown in Figure 1:, Figure 2: demonstrate that the phenomenon of reduced HSF1 activation temperature in testis is unique to the male germ cell types within this tissue. Previous studies showed that incubation of mouse and human cell lines at 42°C causes an increase in phosphorylation of the HSF1 protein in these cells, which results in decreased mobility of this protein on SDS-PAGE gels(4Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 11Larson J.S. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1988; 335: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether HSF1 activated in male germ cells by incubation at the lower threshold temperature of 38°C also undergoes heat-induced covalent modification, Western blot analysis was performed on extracts of germ cells incubated at 32 or 38°C, using HSF1 polyclonal antibodies (4Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The results, shown in Fig. 3A, demonstrate that the HSF1 protein in male germ cells increases in size from a set of bands of 70-74 kDa in 32°C-treated cells (representing different HSF1 basal phosphorylation states(4Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar)) to a relatively discrete band of 84 kDa in 38°C-treated cells. These heat-induced changes in HSF1 size between 32 and 38°C-treated male germ cells are very similar to those previously observed for HSF1 between control (37°C) and heat-shocked (42°C) mouse NIH 3T3 cells(4Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). HSF1 DNA binding activated in mammalian cells by treatment at 42°C mediates the increased expression of heat shock protein genes(10Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether the HSF1 binding activity induced in male germ cells by heat treatment at 38°C functions to regulate hsp gene expression in these cells, extracts of germ cells incubated at 32 or 38°C were subjected to Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody (3a3), which detects both the constitutively expressed hsc70 protein (hsp73) and the heat-inducible hsp70 protein (hsp72)(4Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The results, shown in Fig. 3B, reveal an accumulation of heat-inducible hsp72 stress protein following incubation of germ cells at 38°C, demonstrating the functional ability of the HSF1 DNA binding activity induced at this reduced temperature to mediate a productive cellular stress response in these cells. Previous studies, which employed higher heat shock temperatures than those used in this study, also observed heat-induced hsp expression in male germ cells (19Allen R.L. O'Brien D.A. Eddy E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Allen R.L. O'Brien D.A. Jones C.C. Rockett D.L. Eddy E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3260-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), while other studies reached different conclusions(21Zakeri Z.F. Welch W.J. Wolgemuth D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Lemaire L. Heinlein U.A.O. Life Sci. 1991; 48: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These discrepancies may be due to methodological differences in the condition of the cells exposed to heat treatment (intact testes, dissected seminiferous tubules, or dissociated cells) or to differences in the heat shock treatments employed in each study. Previous results from this laboratory showed that HSF1 DNA binding is activated at a significantly lower temperature in mouse mixed male germ cells relative to mouse liver cells, indicating that the temperature set point for HSF1 activation does not have a fixed value in a given species and can vary in a tissue-dependent manner(12Sarge K.D. Bray A.E. Goodson M.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 126Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The results presented in this paper now reveal two important new features of the regulation of the cellular stress response in testis. First, the results demonstrate that the phenomenon of reduced HSF1 activation temperature in testis is specific to male germ cell types, as it is exhibited by purified pachytene spermatocytes but not by somatic cell types present in testis. Second, these results demonstrate that the HSF1 DNA binding activity induced in male germ cells at this lower threshold temperature is fully functional, capable of mounting a productive cellular stress response resulting in the increased expression of hsp72 stress protein in these cells. What is the mechanism by which the threshold temperature of the cellular stress response is altered in male germ cells? It is unlikely that this phenomenon evolved primarily as an adaptive response to the lower relative growth temperature experienced by cell types within the testis, since somatic cell types present in this tissue do not exhibit a reduced HSF1 activation temperature. We hypothesize that unique features of the biochemical environment in male germ cells, or germ cell-specific regulatory factors, are responsible for altering the temperature set point for HSF1 activation in these cells. Heat-induced protein denaturation has been suggested to be the signal that triggers the conversion of HSF1 to the active, DNA binding form(23Kelley P.M. Schlesinger M.J. Cell. 1978; 15: 1277-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 24Hightower L.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1980; 102: 407-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 25Mosser D.D.

Science. 1986; 232: 522-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Therefore, one possibility is that the reduced HSF1 activation temperature in male germ cells could be due to a lower relative thermal stability of one or more germ cell-specific proteins(27Hightower L.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 28Erickson R.P. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 264-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 29Wolgemuth D.J. Watrin F. Mamm.

Academic Press, New York1993: 181-232Google Scholar). The functional consequences of reduced HSF1 activation temperature in male germ cell types of the testis are not yet known. The fact that this phenomenon is restricted to male germ cell types suggests that an alteration in temperature set point of the cellular stress response is somehow required for the proper function or development of these specialized cell types. However, it is also possible that the reduced induction temperature of the cellular stress response may have negative consequences for male germ cell types. In mouse, testis temperature is tightly regulated at 30°C, 7°C below that of the main body cavity(13Harrison R.G. Weiner J.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1948; 107: 48PGoogle Scholar). The importance of precise thermoregulation of testis is evidenced by the fact that elevations of scrotal temperature, caused by conditions such as varicocele, cryptorchidism, sauna use, or even the wearing of tight insulating clothing, dramatically inhibit spermatogenic cell functions and result in male infertility(32Zorgniotti A.W. Temperature and Environmental Effects on the Testis. Plenum Press, NY1989Google Scholar). The mechanistic basis for heat-induced male infertility is unknown. One possibility is that it is due to relative thermolability of essential spermatogenic cell proteins. However, the results presented above showing induction of the cellular stress response in male germ cells within the same range of temperatures that inhibit spermatogenesis suggest the alternative possibility that heat-induced hsps may play a role in causing male infertility. Stress-induced hsps could inhibit one or more cellular processes essential to male germ cell development, thus leading to an inhibition of spermatogenesis. Further studies will be required to determine whether the cellular stress response plays a cytoprotective or inhibitory role in the negative effects of elevated temperature on spermatogenic cell function and the process of spermatogenesis. Our previous studies demonstrated that another member of the mammalian HSF family, HSF2, exhibited constitutive DNA binding activity in testis cell extracts(33Sarge K.D. Park-Sarge O.-K. Kirby J.D. Mayo K.E. Morimoto R.I. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1334-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, in our present and past studies on the heat induction of HSF1 DNA binding activity in male germ cells, we have observed little HSF DNA binding activity in male germ cells incubated at temperatures of 32-34°C(12Sarge K.D. Bray A.E. Goodson M.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 126Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for this apparent contradiction is that it is due to heat lability of HSF2 DNA binding activity. Previous studies have shown that, in contrast to the heat-stable DNA binding exhibited by HSF1, HSF2 DNA binding activity is very temperature-sensitive and is rapidly destroyed by heat treatment(34Sarge K.D. Zimarino V. Holm K. Wu C. Morimoto R.I. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 35Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1994; 166: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Heat treatment of mammalian cells at 42°C has been shown to cause an increase in phosphorylation of the HSF1 polypeptide(4Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 11Larson J.S. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1988; 335: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This heat-induced HSF1 modification has been suggested to be important for maximal transcriptional activation function of this factor(4Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The results presented in this paper demonstrate that heat treatment of male germ cells at 38°C causes an increase in HSF1 phosphorylation that is similar to that observed in 42°C-treated mouse and human cell lines(4Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the temperature set point of the mechanism that controls the activity of the kinase(s) responsible for heat-induced HSF1 phosphorylation, like the mechanism that controls the activation of HSF1 DNA binding, has been shifted to a lower temperature in male germ cells relative to other cell types. These results suggest that a common signal transduction pathway may be utilized for the regulation of both HSF1 DNA binding and HSF1 phosphorylation in mammalian cells, but this remains to be elucidated.

https://openalex.org/W1679487815,"We recently reported that angiotensin II (AII), acting through the STAT (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) pathway, stimulated a delayed SIF (<i>sis</i>-inducing factor)-like DNA binding activity (maximal at 2-3 h) (Bhat, G. J., Thekkumkara, T. J., Thomas, W. G., Conrad, K. M., and Baker, K. M.(1994) <i>J. Biol. Chem</i>. 269, 31443-31449). Using a cell line transfected with the AT<sub>1A</sub> receptor (T3CHO/AT<sub>1A</sub>), we further characterized the AII-induced SIF response and explored the possible reasons for the delay in stimulated SIF activity. In cells transfected with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid, under the control of a SIE (<i>sis</i>-inducing element), AII markedly stimulated chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity. The delayed SIF activation by AII was not due to a requirement for the release of other SIF inducing factors into the medium and contrasts with the rapid (5 min) induction elicited by the cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6). Interestingly, both agents stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat92 and predominantly the formation of SIF complex A. We tested the hypothesis that AII initially activated an inhibitory pathway, which was responsible for delaying the maximal SIF stimulation until 2 h. Pretreatment of cells for 15 min with AII resulted in significant inhibition of the IL-6-induced nuclear SIF response (10 min) and Stat92 tyrosine phosphorylation, which was blocked by EXP3174, an AT<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist. This inhibition was transient with return of the IL-6-induced SIF response at 2 h, suggesting that the delayed maximal activation of SIF by AII occurs following an initial transient inhibitory phase. Pretreatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 15 min, to activate protein kinase C, resulted in inhibition of the IL-6-induced SIF response (10 min). However, down-regulation of protein kinase C activity prevented phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, but not AII mediated inhibition of the IL-6-induced SIF response. Although the mechanism is not clear, the results presented in this paper raise the interesting possibility that the activation of SIF/Stat92 by AII is characterized by an initial inhibitory phase, followed by the induction process. The observation that AII and IL-6 utilize similar components of the STAT pathway and that AII can cross-talk with IL-6 signaling through inhibition of IL-6-induced SIF/Stat92, implies a modulatory role for AII in cellular responses to cytokines."

Both of these neuroglian species, when transfected into and expressed in Drosophila S2 cells, induce the calcium-independent, homophilic aggregation of transformed cells. A third artificial neuroglian protein form was constructed by substituting the neuroglian transmembrane segment and cytoplasmic domains with the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol attachment signal of the Drosophila fasciclin I protein. This cDNA construct generates a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored form of neuroglian, which retains the ability to induce homophilic cell aggregation when expressed in S2 cells, and was able to interact with both of the two naturally occurring neuroglian polypeptides.

We examined the regulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis by CTP.

The overexpression of CTP synthetase resulted in a 2-fold increase in the utilization of the CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine synthesis. The increase in CDP-choline pathway usage was not due to an increase in the expression of any of the enzymes in this pathway. CDP-choline, the product of the phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase reaction, was the limiting intermediate in the CDP-choline pathway. The apparent Km of CTP (1.4 mM) for phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase was 2-fold higher than the cellular concentration of CTP (0.7 mM) in control cells. This provided an explanation of why the overexpression of CTP synthetase caused an increase in the cellular concentration of CDP-choline. Phosphatidylserine synthase activity was reduced in cells overexpressing CTP synthetase. This was not due to a transcriptional repression mechanism.

Cell culture studies as well as experiments with isolated mitochondria have shown that AZT, ddC, 3′-fluoro-3′-dideoxythymidine and, to a lesser degree, several other dideoxynucleosides can impair overall mtDNA synthesis, which should cause subsequent defects in mitochondrial function leading to delayed cell toxicity(7Dubansky R.M.

However, there have been no studies with a purified and structurally defined mtDNA polymerase to address this issue directly. Saccharomyces cerevisiae mtDNA polymerase, the product of the nuclear MIP1 gene(20Foury F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20552-20560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is the first and thus far only member of this polymerase family that has been cloned and sequenced. The gene encodes a protein of 144 kDa that contains sequence similarities to eukaryotic polymerases, as well as reverse transcriptases. In the N-terminal region, there is both a presumed mitochondrial targeting presequence and several motifs characteristic of 3′-5′ exonuclease domains of other DNA polymerases. By site-directed mutagenesis of key residues in these motifs, it was shown that they were required for exonuclease activity and that the mutant cells exhibited a mitochondrial mutator phenotype(21Foury F. Vanderstraeten S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These studies, which did not involve enzyme purification, and earlier studies of partially purified yeast mtDNA polymerase (22Wintersberger U. Wintersberger E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 13: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) revealed overall biochemical similarities between the yeast enzyme and other mtDNA polymerases isolated from higher eukaryotes (19Gray H.

We describe here the purification of recombinant yeast mtDNA polymerase and characterization of its kinetic properties with regard to several pharmacologically important dideoxynucleotides. For the latter, we have adopted an approach recently used by Copeland et al.(29Copeland W.C. Chen M.S. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21459-21464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for studying incorporation of AZTTP and ddCTP into defined oligonucleotide templates catalyzed by purified human DNA polymerases α and β. The assay system tests nucleotide incorporation during two distinct phases of DNA synthesis; i.e. during the initial extension of the primer and then subsequent elongation by processive synthesis(30Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Mendelman L.V. Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14415-14423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first tested as substrates ddTTP and 3′-FTTP in addition to AZTTP. The former is an analog with as high or higher anti-HIV activity in cell culture and animal model studies as the latter(32Lundgren B. Böttiger D. Ljungdahl-Ståhle E. Norrby E. Ståhle L. Wahren B. öberg B. J. AIDS. 1991; 4: 489-498PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ddCTP and d4CTP, both efficient anti-HIV replication inhibitors(33Baba M. Pauwels M. Herdewijn P. de Clercq E. Vandeputte M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), were used as substrates, and in most cases parallel reactions with recombinant HIV-RT and homogeneous human DNA polymerase α catalytic subunit were performed. Overall, the results show significant enzyme kinetic similarities between mtDNA polymerase and HIV-RT in the capacity to incorporate dideoxynucleotides. Single-subunit human DNA polymerase α was a generous gift from W. C. Copeland and T. S.-F. Wang (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA) and was purified as described previously(29Copeland W.C. Chen M.S. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21459-21464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pure recombinant HIV-RT was a gift from T. Unge (Department of Molecular Biology, The Biomedical Center, Uppsala, Sweden) and was isolated from Escherichia coli as described previously(34Unge T. Ahola H. Bhikhabhai R. Bäckebro K. Lövgren S.

Öberg, (Medivir AB, Huddinge, Sweden) and A. Karlsson (Department of Biochemistry I, The Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). The d4CTP was generously provided by J. Balzarini (The Rega Institute, Leuven, Belgium). The 2-deoxynucleotides, dideoxynucleotides, DEAE-Sephacel, heparin-Sepharose, butyl-Sepharose, poly(dA)•oligo(dT) and poly(rA)•oligo(dT) were from Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. Protease inhibitors were purchased from Sigma or Boehringer Mannheim. Activated calf thymus DNA was from Sigma. The oligonucleotide primer-templates were as described previously(29Copeland W.C. Chen M.S. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21459-21464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) : for thymidine-containing nucleotides and standing start synthesis (Template 1), 18-mer 5′-TGACCATGTAACAGAGAG-3′ with 36-mer template 3′-ACTGGTACATTGTCTCTCATTCTCTCTCTCTTCTCT-5′ and for the running start primer, 16-mer 5′-CGCCCACGCGGCAGA-3′ with 36-mer template 3′-GCGGGTGCGCCGTCTCTTACCTCTTCTCTCTTCTCT-5′. For cytidine-containing substrates, standing start synthesis was performed with 18-mer 5′-TGACCATGTAACAGAGAG-3′ with 36-mer template 3′-ACTGGTACATTGTCTCTCGTTCTCTCTCTCTTCTCT-5′. The entire MIP1 coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction on the MIP1-containing plasmid YEpT7-3 ((20Foury F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20552-20560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Fran¸oise Foury, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Belgium) using a primer with a SacI site and a primer with a ClaI site. The polymerase chain reaction product was purified by electrophoresis onto DEAE-cellulose membrane NA-45 (Schleicher and Schuell). The purified DNA fragment was digested with SacI and ClaI and ligated into pBluescript II KS- digested with the same enzymes to generate the plasmid pMIP1.1. The SphI-XbaI region of the MIP1 gene in the pMIP1.1 was replaced with the same region of the genomic clone to remove possible polymerase chain reaction mutations in this region; this produced plasmid pMIP1.2. The remaining nucleotide sequence upstream and downstream of the SphI-XbaI region was verified, and the entire MIP1 coding region in pMIP1.2 was subcloned into the yeast expression vector pYES2.0 to construct the yeast mtDNA polymerase overexpression plasmid pMIP1.3. The expression of MIP1 in pMIP1.3 is under the control of the Gal1 promoter. Yeast mtDNA polymerase was overexpressed in yeast strain DBY2670 (α, pep4::His3, prblΔ 1.6R, his3-Δ 200, ura3-52, can1) as described for yeast mtRNA polymerase(35Xu B. Clayton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After induction by galactose, yeast mtDNA polymerase expression was increased more than 50-fold. Yeast cells harboring the MIP1 overpression plasmid pMIP1.3 were grown to early stationary phase in 500 ml of the synthetic complete medium without uracil(35Xu B. Clayton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This culture was diluted 50-fold into 20 liters of SGal medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% galactose) to induce the expression of yeast mtDNA polymerase. When the culture reached A600 = 2, the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 2,700 × g. The cells were washed once with cold water and resuspended in 120 ml of buffer D (25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM benzamidine, 1 μg/ml of E64, and 2 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and antipain) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.25 M KCl. The cell suspension was placed in a 250-ml bead beater chamber with 80 ml of glass beads (425-600 microns in size) and beaten for five 1-min pulses alternating with 1 min of cooling. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The cleared extract was diluted with buffer D to lower the KCl concentration to 0.1 M and loaded onto a 50-ml of DEAE-Sephacel column. The column was washed extensively with buffer D containing 0.1 M KCl until the absorbance at 280 nm reached a base line. Yeast mtDNA polymerase was eluted with buffer D containing 0.3 M KCl. The fractions containing proteins were pooled and loaded onto a 12-ml phosphocellulose 11 (Whatman) column (1.5 cm × 6.8 cm) equilibrated with buffer D plus 0.3 M KCl. After a wash with 30 ml of buffer D containing 0.3 M KCl, the column was eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 0.3-0.8 M KCl in buffer D. Fractions containing DNA polymerase activity (eluting at 0.6 M KCl) were pooled and dialyzed against buffer E (the same as buffer D except that 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, was replaced with 25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, and the EDTA concentration was lowered to 1 mM) plus 0.25 M KCl. The dialyzed sample was adjusted to 0.3 M KCl and loaded onto a 3-ml heparin-Sepharose column (1 cm × 3.8 cm). After a wash with 10 ml of buffer E containing 0.3 M KCl, the column was eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient from 0.3 to 0.8 M KCl in buffer E. Yeast mtDNA polymerase eluted at ~0.5 M KCl. Active fractions were pooled, and 3 M ammonium sulfate was added slowly to a final concentration of 0.7 M. This mtDNA polymerase pool was applied to a 1.5-ml butyl-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column. The column was washed with buffer E containing 0.8 M ammonium sulfate and eluted with an 18-ml linear reverse gradient from 0.8 M ammonium sulfate in buffer E to buffer E alone. Fractions containing mtDNA polymerase were pooled, dialyzed against enzyme storage buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 50% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M KCl, 2 mM benzamide, 2 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and antipain) and stored at −80°C. Before dialysis, mtDNA polymerase exhibits low activity due to the high salt concentration. Standard reaction mixtures contained 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 10 mM MgCl2, 40 mM KCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 50 μg/ml aphidicolin, 1 mM DTT, 6 μM [32P]dTTP (~10,000 cpm/pmol), and 20 μg/ml poly(dA)•oligo(dT)10 in a total volume of 25 μl. Reactions were performed at 30°C for 30 min and terminated by dilution into 2 ml of ice cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate. Incorporation of radioactive dTMP into acid-insoluble products was assayed as described previously(35Xu B. Clayton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that incorporated 1 pmol of dTMP in 30 min at 30°C. The processivity of mtDNA polymerase was determined using primed M13mp19 single-strand DNA as the template. The M13-20 sequence primer (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′) was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. A 25-μl reaction contains 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 40 mM KCl, 0.017 pmol of primed M13mp19, 100 μM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 0.071 pmol of mtDNA polymerase or 0.5 units of Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. The reaction was incubated at 30°C for 30 min and terminated by the addition of an equal volume of proteinase K mixture (0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, 1% SDS, and 20 mM EDTA). The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min and was extracted once with phenol/chloroform (1:1). The products were precipitated by ethanol in the presence of 10 μg of E. coli tRNA, dissolved in 12 μl of alkaline loading buffer (50 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, 3% Ficoll), and separated on a 1% alkaline agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. To prepare the primer templates for the running and standing start reactions, primer oligonucleotides were 5′-end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, gel purified, and annealed to the respective templates in a 1:2 ratio as described previously(29Copeland W.C. Chen M.S. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21459-21464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were performed in a volume of 10 μl for 10 min at 37°C with 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM KCl, 0.25 pmol of labeled primer-template, 1-3 ng of mtDNA polymerase, and different concentrations of deoxynucleoside triphosphates. When HIV-RT or DNA polymerase α was used, KCl was omitted. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 volumes of 90% formamide, 0.25 M EDTA, and the products were analyzed on 16 or 19% polyacrylamide-7 M urea gels that were exposed to x-ray film (Hyperfilm MP, Amersham Corp.) without an intensifier screen at −70°C. The films were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics model 300A densitometer (Sunnyvale, CA), and the percentage of radioactivity incorporated into elongated products was determined relative to total loaded radioactivity. Care was taken to remain within the linear range of the film. The kinetic constants were calculated using a reiterative curve fitting program for the Michaelis-Menten equation. The 3′-5′-exonuclease reactions were performed with the standing start template 1 as a control. For the synthesis of a primer terminated with 3′-AZTTP or ddTTP, HIV-RT was used in 10-fold higher amounts and with 50 μM AZTTP or 10 μM ddTTP in a standard 60-min reaction with template 1. This converted more than 90% of 18-mer primer into 19-mer product. The template solutions were extracted with phenol-chloroform, diluted 10-fold with 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA buffer and concentrated in a Centricon (Amicon Apparatus) filter apparatus. In addition to double-stranded templates, exonuclease reactions contained 30 ng of mtDNA polymerase, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 10 mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mM DTT in a volume of 30 μl. Eight-μl samples were taken at different time points and analyzed on 19% polyacrylamide urea gels. Protein was determined by the Pierce BCA protein assay reagent with BSA as the protein standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gels and silver staining for detection of polypeptides were performed as described previously(36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204291) Google Scholar, 37Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hanock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2488) Google Scholar). To facilitate purification of the enzyme, the coding region of the MIP1 gene was cloned into the high copy expression vector pYES2.0, which placed the gene under the control of the inducible Gal1 promoter. Using this system, yeast mtDNA polymerase was purified to homogeneity from whole cell extracts by a simple four-step procedure that included chromatographics over columns of DEAE-Sephacel, phosphocellulose 11, heparin-Sepharose, and butyl-Sepharose (Table I, Fig. 1). Approximately 140 μg of mtDNA polymerase could be obtained from 20 liters of yeast cell culture with an overall purification of ~300-fold and a yield of 6%. It was important to include a mixture of protease inhibitors in the isolation buffers in order to obtain full-length mtDNA polymerase in reasonable yield. The MIP1 gene encodes a 144-kDa polypeptide including the mitochondrial targeting sequence, while its mature form migrates as a 135-kDa species under our electrophoresis conditions. The 135-kDa species is present in the whole cell extract (Fig. 1) but not in the extract from yeast cells that do not overexpress the MIP1 gene (data not shown), suggesting that purified mtDNA polymerase is in intact, mature form. The estimated size difference of the MIP1 gene product with the reported 140-kDa estimate (21Foury F. Vanderstraeten S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) is likely due to the use of different markers used in the two studies. As expected from earlier studies, the enzyme required Mg2+ (or Mn2+) for activity. The optimum Mg2+ or Mn2+ concentration was 6-16 or 2-8 mM, respectively, when poly(dA)•oligo(dT) was used as the substrate (data not shown). Addition of 40-150 mM KCl resulted in a 2-fold stimulation of the polymerase activity, while higher salt concentrations were inhibitory (data not shown). Poly(dA)•oligo(dT) was chosen as the substrate throughout the purification since this DNA template gave the most reproducible activity in crude extracts. Enzyme assays using nicked calf thymus DNA as a template gave erroneously high measurements of activity at earlier stages of the purification, presumably due to nuclease contamination. More highly purified mtDNA polymerase showed a capacity to use poly(dA)•oligo(dT), poly(rA)•oligo(dT), activated calf thymus DNA, or primed M13 DNA as templates. The processivity of the single-subunit mtDNA polymerase was investigated with a primed M13 DNA template assay using 5′-end-labeled primers and cold dNTPs. In this assay, the radioactivity contained in the reaction products represents the number of molecules synthesized. If a DNA polymerase has low processivity, DNA strand elongation will continue for short periods before the polymerase disengages the template and reinitiates on a new template. Multiple rounds of this process would result in apparent simultaneous elongation of all the DNA strands. Compared with Klenow fragment, yeast mtDNA polymerase is highly processive (Fig. 2). Complete template-size products were visible after 2 min, while the majority of primer remained unelongated (Fig. 2, lane1). In contrast, no template-sized product was observed even after a 20-min incubation with Klenow fragment (Fig. 2, lane6). In this case, all products appeared to be elongated simultaneously (Fig. 2, lanes4-6), as predicted for an enzyme having low processivity. In contrast to its high processivity, yeast mtDNA polymerase exhibits very low catalytic efficiency on primed M13 DNA templates. Only a small portion of the template was elongated despite the >3-fold ratio of mtDNA polymerase over primer termini on a molar basis. The main aim of the present study was to determine the kinetic properties of mtDNA polymerase with pharmacologically important dideoxynucleotides. We used an assay system that tested the capacity of the polymerase to incorporate a nucleoside triphosphate either as the first (standing start template) or as the third nucleotide (running start template). The properties of human DNA polymerases α and β were recently described by Copeland et al.(29Copeland W.C. Chen M.S. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21459-21464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the same assay system. A major complicating factor in this work was an intrinsic 3′-5′-exonuclease activity of mtDNA polymerase, which is not found in the two nuclear DNA polymerases. Although yeast mtDNA polymerases with loss of function mutations in exonuclease domains have been reported, these mutations also changed the polymerization properties of the enzyme; e.g. lower polymerization activity and lower processivity(21Foury F. Vanderstraeten S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This precluded the use of these exonuclease-defective mtDNA polymerases in the present study. However, by using low amounts of enzyme, short incubation periods, and adding 100 mM KCl to the reactions, the degradation of the primer-template hybrids was <20% (Fig. 3, compare lanes1 and 2). Since a low concentration of primer-template (25 nM) was used in nucleotide incorporation assays, the measured apparent Km and Vmax may differ significantly from their true values. To overcome this problem of DNA concentration effects, we used relative efficiency (Re) to compare the capacities of DNA polymerases to incorporate deoxynucleotide analogs. Re is the ratio between Vmax/Km values for an analog and the natural dNTP. The elongation of the primer by mtDNA polymerase in the standing start assay was saturated at nM concentrations of dTTP, and the addition of the other deoxynucleotides led to synthesis of some complete 36-mer (Fig. 3). However, smaller products are present that could represent failures to extend or hydrolysis products. When 3′-AZTTP was used as substrate, there was minimal incorporation, even at micromolar concentrations. The identity of the species at the position of a 20-mer is unknown (Fig. 3, lane8). Conversely, 3′-FTTP (Fig. 3; Table 2) and ddTTP (Table 2) served as relatively efficient substrates. Values and standard deviations are from one experiment subsequently repeated at least twice with very similar results, performed and calculated at least twice with very similar results, performed and calculated at least twice with very similar results, performed and calculated as described under “Experimental procedures” Vmax is in pmol/min/mg of protein between the Vmax for AZTTP is the activity with 6000 nM substrate Re is the ratio between the Vmax/Km for the analog triphosphate and the natural dNTP. A second standing start primer-template, specific for cytidine nucleotide incorporation ((29Copeland W.C. Chen M.S. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21459-21464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and see “Experimental Procedures”), was used to determine the efficiency of dCTP, ddCTP, and d4CTP as substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2159351359,"The stress-activated protein (SAP) kinases are induced by tumor necrosis factor, oncoproteins, and UV light. The present studies demonstrate that ionizing radiation (IR) activates p54 SAP kinase. IR-induced activation of SAP kinase is associated with binding to the SH2/SH3-containing adaptor protein Grb2. This interaction is mediated by the SH3 domains of Grb2 and the proline-rich sequence PPPKIP in the carboxyl-terminal region of SAP kinase. We also demonstrate that SAP kinase and the p85α-subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase form a complex in irradiated cells. The results indicate that this complex involves binding of the p85α subunit of PI 3-kinase to the SH2 domain of Grb2. The functional role of linking SAP kinase to PI 3-kinase is further supported by the finding that wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, stimulates SAP kinase activity. These results suggest that the cellular response to IR may include regulation of SAP kinase by a PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway. The stress-activated protein (SAP) kinases are induced by tumor necrosis factor, oncoproteins, and UV light. The present studies demonstrate that ionizing radiation (IR) activates p54 SAP kinase. IR-induced activation of SAP kinase is associated with binding to the SH2/SH3-containing adaptor protein Grb2. This interaction is mediated by the SH3 domains of Grb2 and the proline-rich sequence PPPKIP in the carboxyl-terminal region of SAP kinase. We also demonstrate that SAP kinase and the p85α-subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase form a complex in irradiated cells. The results indicate that this complex involves binding of the p85α subunit of PI 3-kinase to the SH2 domain of Grb2. The functional role of linking SAP kinase to PI 3-kinase is further supported by the finding that wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, stimulates SAP kinase activity. These results suggest that the cellular response to IR may include regulation of SAP kinase by a PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway. The c-jun early response gene is induced by diverse mitogenic stimuli. Although the role of c-Jun in mitogenesis remains unclear, studies have shown that this protein is involved in the G0/G1 transition and progression through late G1/S(1Ryseck R.P. Hirai S.I. Yaniv M.

Other studies have demonstrated that the pp44/42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are activated in irradiated cells and that this event is temporally related to the activation of pp90rsk and early response gene expression(8Kharbanda S.

Recent studies have demonstrated that SAP kinase is activated by a pathway involving MAP kinase and SAP kinase-activating kinase 1(13Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J.

Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The present work has examined involvement of the SAP kinases in IR-induced signaling. The results demonstrate that IR exposure is associated with the activation of SAP kinase and the formation of a Grb2-mediated complex involving SAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. Human U-937 myeloid leukemia cells (ATCC) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mML-glutamine. Irradiation was performed at room temperature using a Gammacell 1000 (Atomic Energy of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario) under aerobic conditions with a 137-centistoke source emitting at a fixed dose rate of 13.3 grays/min as determined by dosimetry. U-937 cells were also treated with 20 ng/ml human recombinant tumor necrosis factor (specific activity, 6.60 × 106 units/mg protein), provided by BASF, Inc. (Worcester, MA), 1 ng/ml rapamycin (provided by the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD), 50 μM H-7 (Seikagaku America, Inc., St. Petersburg, FL), 50 μM HA1004 (Seikagaku), or 250 nM wortmannin (Sigma). Anti-p85α was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-Grb2 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego, CA). Anti-p54 SAP kinase antibodies were prepared as described(10Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2400) Google Scholar). Anti-pp90rsk and anti-Erk 1/2 were obtained from J. Blenis (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). c-Jun fusion protein was prepared as described(15Saleem A. Yuan Z.-M. Kufe D.W. Kharbanda S.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4150-4156PubMed Google Scholar). GST-Grb2 (full-length), GST-Grb2 SH2, GST-Grb2 N-SH3 (amino-terminal SH3 domain), and GST-Grb2 C-SH3 (carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain) fusion proteins were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The GST-Grb2 N-SH3 and GST-Grb2 C-SH3 include amino acids 1-68 and 156-210, respectively, of the Grb2 protein. Cells (2-3 × 107) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin and aprotinin). After incubation on ice for 30 min, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Lysates were incubated with 5 μg of immobilized GST or GST-Jun for 2 h at 4°C. The protein complexes were washed with lysis buffer and then incubated in kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MnCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mM sodium vanadate) containing [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 30°C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Lysates were precleared by incubation with 5 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at 4°C and then for an additional 30 min after the addition of protein A-Sepharose. After preclearing of the cell lysates, the supernatant was incubated with preimmune rabbit serum, anti-p54 SAP kinase, or anti-Grb2 for 1 h at 4°C and then for 30 min after the addition of protein A-Sepharose. The supernatant was also incubated with GST-Grb2 for 1 h at 4°C, and the complexes were recovered by the addition of glutathione beads. The protein complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer and resuspended in kinase buffer containing 1 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) and GST-Jun. The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30°C and terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described(16Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.-M. Rubin E. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20739-20743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, soluble proteins (200 μg) were incubated with anti-p85α (Transduction Laboratories), anti-Grb2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-SAP kinase antibodies for 1 h and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose for an additional 30 min. The resulting immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, separated by electrophoresis on 7.5 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and then transferred to nitrocellulose paper. The residual binding sites were blocked by incubating the filters with 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The filters were incubated with anti-Grb2 or anti-p85α for 1 h with shaking. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20, the blots were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Corp.). The antigen antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL detection system, Amersham Corp.). The fusion proteins GST, GST-Grb2, GST-Grb2 SH2, GST-Grb2 N-SH3, and GST-Grb2 C-SH3 were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose beads and equilibirated in lysis buffer. Cell lysates were incubated with 2 μg of immobilized GST, GST-Grb2, GST-Grb2 SH2, GST-Grb2 N-SH3, or GST-Grb2 C-SH3 fusion proteins for 2 h at 4°C. The resulting protein complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer containing 0.1% detergent and boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. The complexes were then separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and subjected to silver staining or immunoblot analysis with anti-SAP kinase antibody. Peptide was synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)) and subsequently purified by ether precipitation and preparative reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Amino acid analysis was used to confirm the sequence of the SAP kinase-derived peptide: AEAPPPKIPDKQ. GST-Grb2 N-SH3 protein was incubated in the presence or absence of 50 μM synthetic peptide for 1 h at 4°C. The fusion proteins were incubated with lysates from control and irradiated cells, and the adsorbates were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-SAP kinase antibody. Human U-937 myeloid leukemia cells were exposed to 20 grays IR and harvested at 1 h. Lysates were subjected to affinity chromatography with a GST-Jun fusion protein. Adsorbates from IR-treated cells exhibited an increase in Jun kinase activity compared with that of control cells (Fig. 1A). IR-induced stimulation of Jun kinase activity was comparable with that obtained in tumor necrosis factor- (Fig. 1A) or sphingomyelinase-treated cells (data not shown). In order to determine whether the IR-induced Jun kinase activity is due to stimulation of SAP kinase, we assayed anti-p54 SAP kinase immunoprecipitates for phosphorylation of GST-Jun. The finding that IR activates SAP kinase to phosphorylate GST-Jun (Fig. 1B) and not GST (data not shown) supports the involvement of this kinase in IR-induced signaling. Analysis of anti-p54 immunoprecipitates suggested that other proteins associate with p54 after IR exposure. For example, the finding that a 26-kDa protein coprecipitates with SAP kinase raised the possibility of an interaction with Grb2. Grb2, also known as Ash, Sem-5, or Drk (17Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J.

Cell. 1993; 73: 169-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), is an SH2- and SH3-containing adaptor protein that links activated protein-tyrosine kinase receptors to the Ras activator protein Sos. Immunoblot analysis of anti-p54 immunoprecipitates with anti-Grb2 revealed increased reactivity with a 26-kDa protein following IR exposure (Fig. 2A, left panel). To provide additional support for an association between Grb2 and SAP kinase, anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates were analyzed for phosphorylation of GST-Jun. The results demonstrate that Grb2 associates with a Jun kinase activity that is induced by IR treatment (Fig. 2A, middle panel). The interaction between Grb2 and SAP kinase was further examined by incubating lysates from control and IR-treated cells with a GST-Grb2 (full-length) fusion protein. Analysis of the adsorbates to GST-Grb2 supported binding of a kinase that phosphorylates GST-Jun (Fig. 2A, right panel). Analysis of the adsorbates by immunoblotting with anti-p54 also revealed increased reactivity with a 54-kDa protein in the irradiated cells (Fig. 2B). Lysates were similarly incubated with GST fusion proteins prepared from the SH2 and SH3 (carboxyl- and amino-terminal) domains of Grb2. Adsorbates obtained with the GST-Grb2 SH2 fusion protein exhibited no detectable anti-p54 reactivity (Fig. 2B). In contrast, adsorbates from GST-Grb2 N-SH3 or GST-Grb2 C-SH3 revealed binding of SAP kinase when assaying lysates from irradiated but not control cells (Fig. 2B). Lysates from irradiated cells were also incubated with GST-Lyn SH3 and GST-Fyn SH3 fusion proteins. The results demonstrate little if any binding of SAP kinase to these SH3-containing proteins (data not shown). These findings indicated that the IR-induced association between Grb2 and SAP kinase is specifically mediated through the SH3 domains of Grb2. Alignment of the Grb2, Crk, Nck, and Abl SH3-binding sites has identified two proline residues spaced by two nonconserved amino acids. The consensus PXXP has also been observed for certain other SH3-binding sites(21Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 22Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson P. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 23Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that a proline-rich candidate sequence (PPPKIP) in SAP kinase may be responsible for the association with Grb2 SH3 domains. A synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 330-341 (AEAPPPKIPDKQ) of SAP kinase was used in competition assays. Preincubation of GST-Grb2 N-SH3 with the peptide inhibited binding of SAP kinase by 50% in lysates of irradiated cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast, there was no detectable inhibition of SAP kinase binding when using an unrelated peptide (LQHPYINVWYDP) as competitor (data not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated that IR also induces MAP (Erk1/2) and pp90rsk kinase activity(8Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Shafman T. Emoto Y. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5416-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To assess specificity of SAP kinase binding to SH3 domains of Grb2, experiments were performed in which the IR-induced lysates were incubated with GST-Grb2 N-SH3 or GST-Grb2 C-SH3 and the adsorbed proteins assayed by immunoblotting with either anti-MAP or anti-pp90rsk antibodies. The results demonstrate that, unlike SAP kinase, there is no detectable association of MAP and pp90rsk with the Grb2 SH3 domains (Fig. 2C and data not shown). These findings indicate that the IR-induced binding of Grb2 and SAP kinase is mediated through the SH3 domains of Grb2 and the PPPKIP site in SAP kinase. The significance of Grb2 binding to SAP kinase in irradiated cells is presumably to link SAP kinase to an upstream or downstream effector in the IR response. We therefore studied anti-p54 immunoprecipitates to define other proteins that might associate with a Grb2-SAP kinase complex. Staining demonstrated increased binding of a protein at approximately 85 kDa (data not shown). Because the PI 3-kinase consists of 85 and 110 kDa subunits, we asked whether p85α of PI 3-kinase associates with SAP kinase. Analysis of anti-p54 immunoprecipitates with anti-PI 3-kinase (p85α) demonstrated increased reactivity in IR-treated as compared with control cells (Fig. 3A). Although these findings suggest that SAP kinase and PI 3-kinase associate in irradiated cells, the results do not distinguish between direct binding of these molecules or an indirect association through other proteins. One possible explanation for an association between SAP kinase and PI 3-kinase is through Grb2. In this regard, recent studies have demonstrated that PI 3-kinase associates with Grb2 during growth factor stimulation(24Saleem A. Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.-M. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10380-10383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we assayed Grb2 immunoprecipitates for the presence of PI 3-kinase p85α. The results demonstrate binding of p85α to Grb2 in control and irradiated cells (Fig. 3B, left panel). Analysis of anti-p85α immunoprecipitates confirmed binding to Grb2 (Fig. 3B, right panel), although there was no detectable anti-Grb2 reactivity when assaying precipitates with preimmune rabbit serum or anti-c-Abl (data not shown). In order to define the domain of Grb2 involved in binding to PI 3-kinase, lysates from control and IR-treated U-937 cells were subjected to affinity chromatography with GST-Grb2 (full-length), GST-Grb2 SH2, GST-Grb2 C-SH3, or GST-Grb2 N-SH3 domains. The adsorbed proteins were then immunoblotted with anti-p85α. The results demonstrate that association of p85α with the SH2 domain of Grb2 is increased by IR exposure (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the finding that tyrosine phosphorylation of p85α is increased in irradiated cells provides an explanation for the IR-stimulated interaction of this protein with the Grb2 SH2 domain (Fig. 3D). Whereas these findings are in support of a Grb2-mediated association between SAP kinase (through the Grb2 SH3 domains) and PI 3-kinase p85α (through the Grb2 SH2), we also asked whether there is a potential functional relationship between these two proteins. In addressing this possibility, we pretreated cells with wortmannin, a potent PI 3-kinase inhibitor(25Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Acaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar), to determine whether PI 3-kinase is coupled to IR-induced SAP kinase signaling. Wortmannin treatment was associated with stimulation of constitutive levels of SAP kinase activity (Fig. 4A). Moreover, activation of SAP kinase in cells treated with both wortmannin and IR was similar to that obtained with wortmannin alone (Fig. 4A). In contrast, rapamycin (inhibitor of pp70s6k)(27Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), H-7 (a nonspecific protein kinase C inhibitor)(28Hidaka H. Inagaki M. Kawamoto S. Sasaki Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5036-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2315) Google Scholar), and HA1004 (an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase) (29Asano T. Hidaka H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1984; 231: 141-145PubMed Google Scholar) had little effect on SAP kinase activity (Fig. 4B and data not shown). These results suggest a potential role for PI 3-kinase in the regulation of SAP kinase. PI 3-kinase possesses lipid and serine kinase activities(30Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Duckworth B.C. Hou W.M.

Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins through its SH2 domains, and the 110-kDa subunit exhibits catalytic activity. Although IR treatment is associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p85α (Fig. 3D), the precise mechanism by which p85α interacts with the SH2 domain of Grb2 requires further study. The activation of PI 3-kinase results in the formation of PI-3,4-P2 and PI-3,4,5-P3. The finding that the Ca2+- and phorbol ester-insensitive ζ isoform of protein kinase C is activated by PI-3,4,5-P3 has suggested that this kinase may be a target for PI 3-kinase signaling(32Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The serine kinase activity of PI 3-kinase contributes to the phosphorylation of p85 subunit(31Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry J.M. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Other work has indicated that PI 3-kinase phosphorylates the insulin receptor substrate 1 on serine(33Lam K. Carpenter C.L. Ruderman N.B. Friel J.C. Kelly K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20648-20652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wortmannin inhibits both the lipid and serine phosphorylation activities of PI 3-kinase(33Lam K. Carpenter C.L. Ruderman N.B. Friel J.C. Kelly K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20648-20652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of wortmannin on PI 3-kinase signaling pathways may be complex. The present demonstration that wortmannin treatment is associated with activation of SAP kinase suggests that PI 3-kinase may be involved in the regulation of SAP kinase. The findings that PI 3-kinase and SAP kinase form a complex in irradiated cells also supports a possible functional interaction between these two molecules. However, although SAP kinase-activating kinase 1 has been shown to directly stimulate SAP kinase activity(13Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I.

Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays and anti-CNP immunocytochemistry were used to demonstrate that CNP is expressed in mouse marrow cells cultured in the presence, but not the absence, of 1,25-(OH)2D3. mRNA for guanylyl cyclase type B, the receptor for CNP, was expressed in cultures independent of 1,25-(OH)2D3. CNP (1 and 10 μM) elevated cGMP production in marrow cultures to 350 and 870%, respectively, of control values. 10 μM CNP increased osteoclast bone resorptive activity, measured by the resorption area on whale dentine wafers, or by the NH4Cl-inhibitable release of [3H]proline from radiolabeled bone chips, to 214 and 557% of control, respectively, without affecting osteoclast formation. Bone resorption by the marrow cultures was inhibited by 7F9.1, a monoclonal antibody raised against CNP, but not by control antibodies. These results indicate that CNP is a potent activator of osteoclast activity and may be a novel local regulator of bone remodeling. Most agents that regulate osteoclast bone resorption exert their effects indirectly, through the osteoblast. Nitric oxide, which stimulates soluble guanylyl cyclase, has been reported to inhibit osteoclast bone resorption directly, by a cGMP-independent mechanism(1MacIntyre I. Zaidi M. Alam A.S. Datta H.K.

These results indicate that CNP is a potent activator of osteoclast activity and may be a novel local regulator of bone remodeling. Bone is renewed by the bone remodeling cycle, in which bone resorption by osteoclasts is tightly coupled to new bone formation by osteoblasts(2Suda T. Takahashi N. Martin T.J. Endocr.

Most factors that affect osteoclast bone resorption exert their effects indirectly, stimulating the osteoblast to produce intermediary messengers that act on the osteoclast(4Mundy G.R. Int. J. Cell Cloning. 1992; 10: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although numerous factors participate in bone remodeling(3Martin T.J. Ng K.W. J. Cell.

Science. 1975; 189: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) suggested that intracellular cGMP is involved in the control of bone remodeling. Cellular cGMP is synthesized by two general classes of guanylyl cyclases: soluble cytoplasmic guanylyl cyclases and cyclases associated with the plasma membrane (for review, see (8Drewett J.G. Garbers D.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 135-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and (9Garbers D.L. Koesling D. Schultz G. Mol. Biol.

Several lines of evidence support a role for NO in bone remodeling. Osteoclast bone resorptive activity is suppressed by agents such as nitroprusside that generate NO(1MacIntyre I. Zaidi M. Alam A.S.

Osteoclasts generate NO, and treatment of isolated chicken osteoclasts or intact rats with nitric oxide synthase inhibitors causes them to resorb more bone(12Kasten T.P. Collin-Osdoby P. Patel N. Osdoby P. Krukowski M. Misko T.P. Settle S.L. Currie M.G. Nickols G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3569-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts possess NO synthase activity that is regulated by cytokines, which affect bone metabolism(13Lowik C.W. Nibbering P.H. van de Ruit M. Papapoulos S.E. J. Clin.

The other principal cellular sources of cGMP are the three membrane-bound receptor guanylyl cyclases: guanylyl cyclase type A (GC-A), type B (GC-B), and type C (GC-C). Atrial natriuretic factor (ANP or atriopeptin) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) are the specific ligands of GC-A and GC-B, respectively, and guanylin is the endogenous ligand for GC-C(8Drewett J.G.

The involvement of natriuretic peptides and receptor guanylyl cyclases in bone is only beginning to emerge. Guanylyl cyclase activity has been detected by histochemical methods in the plasma membrane of osteoblasts, but it has not been demonstrated in osteoclasts(15Fukushima O. Gay C.V. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts respond to ANP by increasing cGMP production(16Fletcher A.E. Allan E.H. Casley D.J. Martin T.J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but ANP has only minimal effects on bone remodeling(17Vargas S.J. Holden S.N. Fall P.M. Raisz L.G. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2527-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). CNP, first identified in 1990 in the central nervous system(18Sudoh T. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), has been found in a growing list of tissues. The CNP receptor, GC-B, has been detected in bone marrow(19Agui T. Yamada T. Legros G. Nakajima T. Clark M. Peschel C. Matsumoto K. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2487-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although CNP has not been demonstrated in marrow(20Minamino N. Aburaya M. Kojima M. Miyamoto K. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 326-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), CNP and GC-B have been found in cell types closely related to bone cells. Both CNP and GC-B are expressed in cultured chondrocytes(21Hagiwara H. Sakaguchi H. Itakura M. Yoshimoto T. Furuya M. Tanaka S. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10729-10733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which originate from the same stromal lineage as osteoblasts(22Taylor S.M. Jones P.A. Cell. 1979; 17: 771-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 23Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Ikeda T. Yoshiki S. Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Wang E.A. Tanaka H. Omura S. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts originate from cells of monocytic lineage, and CNP is produced by the monocytic cell line, THP-1(24Ishizaka Y. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Ishii K. Takano S. Eto T. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These observations suggested to us the possibility that CNP might function as a local regulator of bone resorptive activity through a cGMP-mediated pathway. In this paper, we demonstrate that CNP is a potent stimulator of osteoclast bone resorption in mouse bone marrow cultures, a well-characterized model system for studying osteoclasts (25Takahashi N. Yamana H. Yoshiki S. Roodman G.D. Mundy G.R. Jones S.J. Boyde A. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were from Sigma and were the highest available grade. MDCT cells (26Gesek F.A. Friedman P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Dr. Peter A. Friedman, Dartmouth University. Osteoclast-containing mouse bone marrow cultures were obtained as described by Takahashi et al.(25Takahashi N. Yamana H. Yoshiki S. Roodman G.D. Mundy G.R. Jones S.J. Boyde A. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). 4-6-week-old Swiss-Webster mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Femurs and tibias were dissected free of adherent tissue; the marrow was expelled by cutting both bone ends and flushing the marrow cavity with α-modified minimum essential medium (αMEM D10, Sigma) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) using a 25-gauge needle. The marrow cells were washed twice and plated either on 24-well plates or tissue culture dishes at a density of 1 × 106 nucleated cells/cm2 in αMEM D10 containing 1 × 10−8M 1,25-(OH)2D3 (a kind gift from Dr. Milan Uskoković, Hoffman LaRoche, Inc., Nutley, NJ). Cultures were fed on the third and fifth day of culture by replacing half of the medium with fresh medium containing 2 × 10−8M 1,25-(OH)2D3. Histochemical staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity performed with a commercial kit (Sigma), was used to identify osteoclasts, as described previously(27Wang Z.Q. Hemken P. Menton D. Gluck S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F277-F283PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, reagents used for RT-PCR were purchased from Promega Biotech (Madison, WI). The oligonucleotide primers used to amplify CNP cDNA were 5′-TGCTCGCGCTACTCTCACT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTGGGGTGCTCGTGCAGA-3′ (antisense) corresponding to bases 151-169 and 379-397 of the published nucleotide sequence of the rat cDNA(28Komatsu Y. Nakao K. Suga S. Ogawa Y. Mukoyama M. Arai H. Shirakami G. Hosoda K. Nakagawa O. Hama N. Kishimoto I. Imura H. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1104-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These primers have been shown previously to amplify mouse CNP cDNA(29Dean A.D. Vehaskari V.M. Greenwald J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F491-F496PubMed Google Scholar). The amplified product spans an intron-exon boundary containing a 444-bp intron in the human CNP genomic DNA sequence(28Komatsu Y. Nakao K. Suga S. Ogawa Y. Mukoyama M. Arai H. Shirakami G. Hosoda K. Nakagawa O. Hama N. Kishimoto I. Imura H. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1104-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The PCR primers for GC-B, 5′-AACTGATGCTGGAGAAGGAGC-3′ (sense), and 5′-TACTCGGTGACGATGCAGAT-3′ (antisense) were the same primers as those used by Ohyama et al.(30Ohyama Y. Miyamoto K. Saito Y. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These primers amplify both the active (356 bp) and the inactive (280 bp) forms of GC-B. The amplification primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase corresponded to bases 40-56 (5′-GTCGGTGTCAACGGATT-3′, sense) and 1001-1017 (5′-CATGTAGGCCATGAGGT-3′, antisense) from the rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA sequence (31Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar) and amplify a 975-bp product. For preparation of the competitive plasmid standards for CNP, a 100-bp oligonucleotide was synthesized corresponding to bases 151-173 and 319-397, omitting a 146-bp internal segment of the cDNA sequence. Plasmid standards for GC-B and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were constructed by selective restriction enzyme digestion of amplified target DNA to remove a fragment of DNA between the 5′ and 3′ primer sites. A fragment of GC-B spanning bases 1511-1865 was cleaved with TaqI and ligated to yield a 130-bp fragment from which bases 1587-1812 were excised. A fragment of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (bases 40-1017) was cleaved with AccI and ligated to yield an 817-bp fragment from which bases 156-316 were excised. The resulting products were amplified by PCR, and ligated into the vector pCRII (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Amplification of these competitive plasmid standards resulted in products that were 100, 132, and 814 bp in size for CNP, GC-B, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively. PCR-amplified products for CNP, GC-B, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were verified by sequence analysis. The levels of CNP, GC-B, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA were measured by competitive RT-PCR using the protocol of Siebert and Larrick(32Siebert P.D. Larrick J.W. Nature. 1992; 359: 557-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from cell cultures using RNAzol B (Cina/Biotecx, Friendswood, TX). Equal amounts of RNA were taken to prepare cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase as described previously(29Dean A.D. Vehaskari V.M. Greenwald J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F491-F496PubMed Google Scholar). Equal volumes of the resulting cDNAs were added to PCR tubes containing PCR buffer, 0.8 μM primers, and a single concentration of competitive plasmid standard (0.001, 0.001, and 0.01 amol for CNP, GC-B, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively) and amplified using conditions as described previously(29Dean A.D. Vehaskari V.M. Greenwald J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F491-F496PubMed Google Scholar). After PCR amplification, samples were fractionated by gel electrophoresis (CNP and GC-B, 1.5% agarose; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide), visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and photographed using Polaroid 55 positive/negative film (Cambridge, MA). Target and plasmid standard amplified products were easily distinguished by size. Negatives were densitometrically scanned (E-C Apparatus Corp.; St. Petersburg, FL), and band intensities were analyzed using Beckman System Gold software (Beckman Instrumentation Inc., Fullerton, CA). The densitometric ratios of target CNP and GC-B to their plasmid standard were measured and normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ratios. 7-day-old 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated mouse bone marrow cultures were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in HENAC (30 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2) for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in HENAC for 20 min, washed 3 times with HENAC, blocked with 3% BSA, 1% lysine in HENAC and then washed again 3 times with HENAC. Cells were incubated for 2 h with rabbit polyclonal anti-CNP (Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA) diluted 1:50 in HENAC plus 1% BSA, washed once with HENAC, incubated with 5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate/goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) in HENAC plus 1% BSA for 2 h and then washed 3 times over a period of 30 min with HENAC. Controls were prepared identically, except that nonimmune rabbit serum, diluted 1:50, was added to the primary incubation buffer. Cells were examined with an Optiphot-2 microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) using epifluorescent illumination. All fluorescence micrographs were taken with 60-s exposures and printed identically. For the assays in mouse bone marrow, cells were plated in six-well plates at 1 × 107 nucleated cells/well and incubated for 7 days in the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3. The cells were then washed and incubated with fresh αMEM D10 for 2 h, after which they were incubated for 15 min in 1 ml of αMEM D10 medium containing varying concentrations of CNP (Peninsula) and 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX). The cells were then washed with PBS, and 1 ml of 1-propanol was added. cGMP was measured by ELISA using a kit from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Levels were determined from a standard curve, and concentrations of cGMP were normalized for cell protein/well determined using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad) for the Bradford protein assay(33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). For the assays in MDCT cells, 2 × 105 cells were plated in each well of a 24-well plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After approximately 24 h, when the cells were nearly confluent, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 10 min in 1 ml containing 0.5 ml of αMEM D10, 0.5 ml of hybridoma supernatant (antibody concentration approximately 10 μg/ml) or control medium, 1 μM CNP or ANP, and 0.5 mM IBMX. The cells were then washed, and cGMP/mg of cell protein was measured as described above. 3H-Proline release assays were performed by a modification of a published method(34Blair H.C. Kahn A.J. Crouch E.C. Jeffrey J.J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 mCi of L-[5-3H]proline (Amersham Corp.) was injected into 60-g weanling rats. After 12 days, the rats were sacrificed, and the long bones were ground and filtered to yield a fraction with particle size between 23 and 43 μm. Bone particles and CNP or vehicle were added to the mouse marrow cell cultures after 5 days. For each assay, an identical well was incubated with 5 mM NH4Cl, which inhibits osteoclast bone resorption by preventing acidification of the sealed compartment(35Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Ghiselli R. Gluck S. Science. 1989; 245: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Bone chips incubated in αMEM D10 containing no cells served as control blank wells. The assay was allowed to proceed for 5 days (CNP was replenished after 3 days), following which the medium was removed and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble counts (unresorbed bone chips); soluble counts/min were determined by scintillation counting in Formula 963 scintillation fluid (DuPont NEN). The number of background counts was determined from the blanks and subtracted. Resorption pit-forming assays were performed essentially as described by Boyde et al.(36Boyde A. Ali N.N. Jones S.J. Scanning Electron Microsc. 1985; 3: 1259-1271Google Scholar). Sperm whale teeth were obtained from the United States Department of Fisheries, and 100-μm-thick sections with surface area of about 1 cm2 were cut using a low speed diamond saw (Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL). Slices were washed by agitation in 50 ml of sterile PBS and then stored in αMEM D10. 2 days prior to assays, dentine slices were transferred to 24-well plates and incubated in αMEM D10. Mouse bone marrow cells were cultured in tissue culture plates for 5 days and then scraped free using a disposable cell scraper (Costar, Cambridge, MA), washed with αMEM D10 3 times, and plated on bone slices at a concentration of 1 × 106 total cells/well. Cells were maintained on the dentine wafers for 5 days; medium was replaced after 3 days. Dentine slices were then rinsed with 1% SDS to remove cells and debris, fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, dehydrated through an ethanol series, air dried, sputter coated with gold, and examined using a Hitachi H-400 scanning electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan) operated at 15 kV. For quantitation, photos of slices were taken at 100× with no tilt angle. Overlays that divided micrographs into 42-μm2 grid spaces were placed over photos, and grid spaces with or without pits were counted to determine the surface area resorbed. For the experiments shown in Table2, resorption pit number and area was determined in three representative fields from each of six separate dentine slices. For enumeration, a single pit was counted as any contiguous area of bone resorption, even if it contained more than one scalloped area.TABLE II Open table in a new tab Where indicated in the text, 1 × 10−8M 1,25-(OH)2D3, 1 μM CNP, or 1 μM ANP, and inhibiting antibodies (20 μg/ml) were added on the first day of the resorption pit-forming assay and replenished after 3 days. 7F9.1 is a monoclonal antibody that was raised against CNP and binds both CNP and ANP (see “Results”). MRW is a monoclonal antibody that is specific for ANP(37Wilkins M.R. Settle S.L. Needleman P. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1274-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-β-galactosidase was purchased from Sigma. For production of the CNP conjugate used for immunization, 200 μg of CNP (as CNP-22, Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA) and 200 μg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma) were dissolved in 200 μl of 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 4.7, and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) was added to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml as described previously(38Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at 22°C overnight, and 600 μl of PBS was added. The mixture was emulsified with 800 μl of complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). BALB/c mice were immunized with 200 μl of the emulsion intraperitoneally at monthly intervals. After three immunizations, the spleen was removed, and hybridomas were generated by standard methods(39Dunbar B.S. Skinner S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 670-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Hybridoma supernatants were screened by ELISA; 96-well plates (Nunc, Naperville, IL) were incubated with 50 μl of CNP peptide (2 μg/ml) overnight at 4°C, washed twice with PBS, and incubated overnight at 4°C with 50 μl of bovine serum albumin 10 mg/ml in PBS (BSA buffer). The plates were washed twice with PBS, and incubated with 50 μl/well of test hybridoma culture supernatant for 2 h at 22°C. The plates were washed 3 times with PBS and incubated for 1 h at 22°C with 50 μl/well of peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:1000 in BSA buffer. Plates were washed 5 times with PBS, and peroxidase activity was measured using a o-phenylenediamine-HCl as a substrate(40Humphreys G.K. Sconyers B.J. Ragland W.L. J.

Specificity of the monoclonal antibodies for CNP and ANP was established by adding concentrations of peptide, indicated in the text, to the hybridoma supernatant prior to incubation on the ELISA plate(40Humphreys G.K. Sconyers B.J. Ragland W.L. J. Immunoassay. 1981; 2: 137-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Samples were compared by analysis of variance (except for Table2, in which a t test was used) using the program SigmaStat (Jandel, San Rafael, CA). p values < 0.05 were considered significant. To determine whether CNP and its receptor are expressed in mouse bone marrow cultures, we tested for the presence of CNP and GC-B mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR. mRNA for CNP was found in freshly isolated mouse bone marrow cells maintained in culture for 7 days in the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (Fig. 1). CNP mRNA was not detected in marrow cells cultured in the absence of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (Fig. 1). In the same cells, mRNA for the CNP receptor GC-B was detectable, and approximately the same level of GC-B mRNA was found in cells incubated with 1,25-(OH)2D3. To confirm that the CNP protein was expressed in the marrow cell cultures and to determine which cell types express CNP, we performed fluorescent immunocytochemistry on 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated or unstimulated cultures, using an anti-CNP polyclonal antibody. In 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated cultures, all of the giant, multinucleated osteoclasts were intensely labeled in areas surrounding nuclei (Fig. 2, A and B). Many mononuclear and stromal cells were also stained. Cultures not stimulated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 did not label with anti-CNP antibody (Fig. 2, C and D). Low levels of background staining were found in 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated cultures when the primary antibody was omitted (Fig. 2, E and F). We assayed for the presence of functional GC-B by testing whether the cultures respond to CNP by producing cGMP. Mouse bone marrow was plated in six-well plates at 1 × 107 nucleated cells/well and incubated for 7 days in the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3, as described under “Experimental Procedures”; the cells were then washed and incubated in solutions containing IBMX and varying concentrations of CNP, and cGMP was measured by radioimmunoassay. The marrow cultures stimulated with CNP produced cGMP in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3). This result and the observation of GC-B mRNA in the cultures indicate that the cells likely express functional GC-B receptors that are responsible for cGMP production in response to CNP stimulation. Since cGMP is suspected to be an important regulator of bone remodeling, we examined whether CNP alters osteoclast resorptive activity. Two different resorption assays were used. First, the ability of osteoclasts to release soluble [3H]proline from [3H]proline-radiolabeled bone chips was examined. 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated marrow cells were maintained in culture for 5 days to ensure development of mature osteoclasts, and labeled bone particles were added. The cells were incubated for an additional 5 days in the presence or absence of CNP, and with or without NH4Cl to inhibit acidification-dependent resorption(35Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Ghiselli R. Gluck S. Science. 1989; 245: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Both the total [3H]proline counts released and the component of 3H release inhibited by treatment with NH4Cl were determined. Fig. 4 shows that 1 μM CNP added to cultures between day 6 and day 10 increased resorption by 34%, and 10 μM CNP increased resorption by 118%. CNP had little or no effect on the number of NH4Cl-insensitive 3H counts released. In marked contrast, 10 μM CNP increased the ammoni"

Within minutes of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment, epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2 tyrosine phosphorylation was decreased, while platelet-derived growth factor receptor and insulin receptor autophosphorylation was up-regulated. These effects are not mediated by protein kinase C-dependent receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation but apparently by activation or inactivation of receptor tyrosine kinase-specific phosphatases, as indicated by neutralization of these phenomena upon treatment of cells with sodium orthovanadate. In contrast to these short term effects, sustained activation of protein kinase Cα by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate results in translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol to the membrane fraction where it forms stable complexes with all receptor tyrosine kinases investigated. Ligand-induced receptor tyrosine kinase/protein kinase C association in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts is accompanied by a mobility shift of the receptor, indicating phosphorylation by activated protein kinase C. This phenomenon correlates with the disappearance of receptor tyrosine kinases from the cell surface, implying that this interaction plays a role in the process of receptor internalization and degradation.

Reversible protein phosphorylation on tyrosine residues represents a regulatory mechanism that governs a wide spectrum of fundamental processes in cells of higher eukaryotes. Among the cellular enzymes that catalyze these reactions are tyrosine kinases with a covalently connected extracellular ligand binding function, which play a key role in the intercellular communication network that is crucial for the regulation of growth, development, and metabolic homeostasis of multicellular organisms.

Engagement of such cellular effector systems occurs through phosphorylated tyrosine residues of RTKs, which function as high affinity binding sites for proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. These occur either in combination with a catalytic function such as phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), the GTPase-activating protein (GAP), the Src tyrosine kinase, the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1D/Syp, and the GDP/GTP exchanger protein Vav or as adapter proteins such as the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI 3′-kinase), CRK, NCK, SHC, and GRB2 (reviewed in (1Schlessinger J.

Despite extensive information concerning molecular interactions in the signaling cascade triggered by receptor-ligand interaction on the cell surface, the events that eventually activate specific gene transcription and define the ligand-characteristic response of the cell remain poorly understood. It is clear, however, that downstream from tyrosine-phosphorylated primary substrates the activation of serine/threonine kinases is of major significance for signal transmission and definition.

The PKC serine/threonine kinases, a family of at least 12 isoenzymes with distinct tissue distribution characteristics, have been subdivided on the basis of different primary structures and enzymatic properties into Ca2+-dependent or conventional PKCs and the Ca2+-independent or novel PKCs (reviewed in ref. 14), and extensive evidence is available for their involvement in control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and motility(15Clemens M.J. Trayner I. Menaya J. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 881-887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While certain PKC isotypes are activated by phorbol esters such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), their physiological ligand is the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG)(16Nishizuka Y.

In addition to DAG, PLCγ-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate yields inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, a regulator of intracellular [Ca2+]i, which together with DAG activates PKC. Among its diverse effects on the physiology of cells (reviewed in (16Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3509) Google Scholar)), PKC was shown to phosphorylate and activate the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1(23Sözeri O. Vollmer K. Liyanage M. Frith D.

Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K-J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). In addition to this positive influence on growth factor signals, PKC activation is known to down-modulate the signaling potential of the receptors for EGF and insulin. Phosphorylation of the EGF-R at Thr-654 attenuates high affinity EGF binding (26Downward J. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14538-14546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and causes a decrease in EGF-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity and DNA synthesis(27Decker S.J. Mol. Cell.

Similarly, the signaling activity of the insulin receptor, which appears to be primarily phosphorylated on carboxyl-terminal serine and threonine residues(29Kasuga K. White M.F. Kahn R.

Moreover, as recently shown, phorbol ester treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing PKCα and the insulin receptor resulted in phosphorylation of receptor threonine and serine residues without an effect on tyrosine phosphorylation but caused inhibition of insulin-stimulated PI 3′-kinase activity(37Chin J.E. Dickens M. Tavare J.M. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6338-6347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the EGF-R and PDGF-R share common signaling pathways, they differ with respect to PKC-dependent negative feedback mechanisms. While PMA treatment of A431 cells blocks EGF-induced PI turnover(38Pike L.J. Eakes A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1644-1651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Johnson R.M. Garrison J.C.

In addition to its differential effects on receptor-ligand interactions and signal transduction, PKC has been implicated in receptor internalization and degradation. Chen et al.(42Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C-P. Walton G.M. Der C.J. Wiley H.S. Gill G.H. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 33-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) identified a distinct region within the EGF-R COOH terminus that appears to be required for ligand-dependent down-regulation and degradation. Interestingly, the high affinity binding site for PLCγ, Tyr-992, is located within this region(43Rotin D. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Daly R.J. Daum G. Li N. Fischer E.H. Burgess W.H. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), which suggests that PKC activation via PLCγ-generated second messengers is involved in receptor down-regulation. Nevertheless, the molecular signals that are involved are still poorly understood, and their interpretation is a matter of controversy. To further elucidate the complex role of PKC in the cellular signaling network, we investigated its short and long term effects on RTK function. While short term stimulation of PKC affects the EGF and HER1-2 receptors differently than those for PDGF and insulin, the functional consequences for these receptors are identical after prolonged PKC activation. PKC-mediated signal modulation involves ligand-induced, high affinity complex formation with receptors. Moreover, our findings strongly support a role for PLCγ in PKC-mediated down-regulation of RTK signals. Transient expression was performed in human embryonic kidney fibroblast 293 cells, while stable expression of RTK cDNAs was performed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.

For stable expression in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, the RTK cDNAs were introduced into an expression plasmid containing SV40 early promoter elements and 3′-untranslated sequences of the hepatitis virus surface antigen gene. The following monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antisera were used: 108.1 (49Honegger A.M. Kris R.M. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

High efficiency transformation of human embryonic kidney fibroblast 293 cells was performed essentially as described by Chen and Okayama (51Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4783) Google Scholar) and Gorman et al.(52Gorman C.M. Gies D. McCray G. Huang M. Virology. 1989; 171: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293 cells were seeded into 6-well dishes (1.5 × 105 cells/well) or 10-cm dishes (~8 × 105 cells/dish) and incubated overnight in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). A total of 6 and 20 μg, respectively, of expression plasmid DNA was mixed with 0.15 or 0.5 ml of 0.25 M CaCl2, 0.15 or 0.5 ml of 2 × BBS (280 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Na2HPO4, 50 mM BES, pH 6.95). The mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature, added to the cells, swirled gently, and incubated for 18 h at 35°C under 3% CO2. The medium was replaced by fresh DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, incubated for 24 h at 37°C under 5% CO2, and subsequently lysed. In experiments in which cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp.), the cells were transfected as described. The next morning, medium was replaced by DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and in the evening replaced again by methionine-free DMEM containing 3% fetal calf serum and 60 μCi of [35S]methionine/ml. Cell labeling was carried out overnight. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting procedures were carried out according to standard protocols(45Seedorf K. Felder S. Millauer B. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12424-12431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells overexpressing HER1-2 and control cells were cultured overnight in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.5% fetal calf serum and subsequently treated with EGF, EGF and PMA, or vehicle for 10 min. Cells were lysed as described above. After a series of washes with HNTG buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, the presence of PI 3′-kinase activity in the precipitates was determined by incubating the precipitates with kinase buffer containing 30 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 30 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM adenosine, 40 μM ATP, 0.2 mg/ml sonicated phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 10 min at 30°C. The phospholipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1) and washed twice with methanol, 1 N HCl (1:1) and finally spotted onto thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates. After one-dimensional chromatography, the plates were exposed to x-ray film. Radioactive lipids corresponding to authentic phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PIP) standards were scraped from the plates and quantitated by Cerenkov counting. The PKC activity associated with the HER1-2 receptor following ligand stimulation was assayed as follows. Immunoprecipitated HER1-2 receptor complexes (10-μl packed protein A-Sepharose beads) were resuspended in reaction mixture (final volume, 50 μl) containing 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mM magnesium acetate, 10 μM synthetic substrate peptide, 40 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 4 μg/ml diolein, 0.1 mM calcium chloride, 40 μM EGTA, and 40 μM EDTA. For the assay of non-PKC kinase activity, the lipid mixture was replaced with 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), and the calcium chloride/EGTA/EDTA solution was replaced with 0.5 mM EGTA. The samples were incubated at 30°C for 25 min, followed by brief cooling on ice and centrifugation, and then a 20-μl aliquot of each sample was spotted onto a 1.5 × 1.5-cm square of phosphocellulose paper (P81, Whatman). The paper squares were washed in 75 mM phosphoric acid, with four changes of solution, and the bound radiolabeled peptide was quantitated by Cerenkov radiation. 293 cells transfected with receptor, receptor and PLCγ, receptor and PKC, or receptor, PLCγ, and PKC expression plasmids were labeled for 18 h with [35S]methionine, and receptor degradation was subsequently measured by a chase in normal culture medium in the presence of EGF (50 ng/ml) or PMA (1 μM) for various times. Receptors were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the EGF-R (mAb 108.1) and analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The gel was treated with Amplify (Amersham) and exposed to x-ray film. To analyze the functional relationship of PKC and various RTKs in intact cells, we employed chimeric receptors consisting of the human EGF-R extracellular domain fused to the cytoplasmic domains of the murine PDGF-β-R (EP-R), human insulin receptor (EI-R), and the EGF-R isozyme HER2 (HER1-2). As previously shown, all of these chimeric receptors are functional and generate a cytoplasmic domain-characteristic cellular signal upon stimulation with EGF (44Lee J. Dull T.J. Lax I.

The chimeric receptor cDNAs and those of EGF-R, PLCγ, GAP, p85 subunit of PI 3′-kinase, and PKCα were used in the form of cytomegalovirus early promoter-driven expression vector (CMV) constructs for transient expression experiments in human 293 embryonic fibroblasts. To confirm results obtained in transient overexpression experiments, we employed NIH 3T3 cell lines, which had been transfected with RTK cDNA expression plasmids and were established as stable lines. Short term effects of activated PKC on the autophosphorylation of different RTKs under comparable conditions were investigated by transfection of 293 cells with pCMV expression plasmids containing EP-R, HER2, HER1-2, EI-R cDNAs, and the insertless vector as a control either alone or in combination with pCMV-PKCα. As shown in Fig. 1, tyrosine phosphorylation of all receptors was induced upon EGF stimulation of intact cells for 10 min (lanes1 and 2). When EGF was added together with the PKC activator PMA (shown as TPA) (lane9), the phosphotyrosine content of EGF-R and HER1-2 was significantly reduced, while EP-R and EI-R autophosphorylation was enhanced about 2-fold. Incubation with sodium orthovanadate, a potent inhibitor of phosphotyrosine-specific phosphatases, did not stimulate receptor phosphorylation in the absence of EGF (lane5) and did not further increase EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (lane6); however, it caused full recovery of PMA-mediated suppression of EGF-R and HER1-2 phosphorylation (compare lanes9 and 11). Cotransfection with PKCα expression plasmid (lanes3, 4, 7, 8, 10, and 12) suppressed autophosphorylation of EGF-R, HER1-2, and EI-R in the presence of EGF (lanes3 and 4), and PMA-mediated activation of overexpressed PKCα caused complete abolishment of EGF-R and HER1-2 tyrosine phosphorylation while EI-R showed a slight recovery (lane10). Inhibition of phosphotyrosine-specific phosphatases in these cells by sodium orthovanadate had a positive effect on EGF-R, HER1-2, and EI-R autophosphorylation (compare lanes4 and 8, and 10 and 12) but was not able to fully reverse the PKCα-mediated suppression on receptor autophosphorylation. In all cases, EP-R tyrosine phosphorylation remained relatively unaffected. Expression levels of receptor and PKC were the same under all experimental conditions (not shown). These data suggest that EGF-R and HER1-2 phosphorylation on tyrosine residues may be down-regulated through PMA-mediated activation of a kinase inhibitory mechanism involving vanadate ion-sensitive phosphotyrosine phosphatases, which appear not to participate under PKC overexpression conditions. The EI-R and EP-R were positively affected by PMA treatment, indicating that these receptors are differently regulated by phosphatases; however, PKCα overexpression also inhibited EI-R autophosphorylation, suggesting that the tyrosine kinase was also inhibited. Phosphorylation of RTKs such as EGF-R and I-R by PMA-activated PKC has been reported previously (reviewed in (53Houslay M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 9-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 54Farese R.V. Standaert M.L. Arnold T. Yu B. Ishizuka T. Hoffman J. Vila M. Cooper D.R. Cell.

The significance of this modification is not fully understood and appears to differ for individual RTKs and different cell types. In view of the differential effects on autophosphorylation of four chimeric receptors (Fig. 1), we investigated the parameters that regulate RTK-PKC interaction. Transfected 293 cells transiently overexpressing either RTKs alone or with PKCα were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 18 h and treated with PMA for 60 min. As shown in Fig. 2, in the absence of PKCα overexpression (lanes1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11), PMA treatment (lanes2, 5, 8, 11) caused no mobility shift of RTKs in SDS-PAGE, suggesting that the differential effects on RTK phosphorylation shown in Fig. 1 were not due to covalent, PMA-inducible modifications. In contrast, in cells coexpressing PKCα, PMA treatment resulted in a mobility shift of all RTKs. Interestingly, under these conditions immunoprecipitation with the EGF-R extracellular domain-specific mAb 108.1 led to coprecipitation of PKCα, suggesting that even in the absence of ligand, the RTKs used in this experiment bound PMA-activated PKC, but only when both proteins were overexpressed. This observation was confirmed with PKC-specific antibodies, which coimmunoprecipitated all receptors from samples that contained overexpressed PKCα (data not shown). Moreover, PMA-activated PKC associated with the kinase-deficient EGF-R mutant HERK721A (data not shown), further supporting our observation that receptor autophosphorylation is not required for PKC binding. To investigate whether complex formation of RTKs with PKC was an artifact of overexpression, we examined NIH 3T3 cell lines expressing the various receptors at levels of 1.5-2.5 × 105 per cell. As shown in Fig. 3, immunoprecipitation of EP-R, EGF-R, HER1-2, and EI-R led to coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous PKC already in the absence of EGF. The amounts of RTK-bound PKC in starved cells varied, especially in the case of HER1-2, between experiments from barely detectable to somewhat further inducible by EGF treatment. Coimmunoprecipitation was further increased by ligand addition for all cell lines, indicating that receptor activation leads to enhanced PKC binding. Having demonstrated that PKC associates with the receptors for PDGF, EGF, HER2, and insulin in a ligand-dependent manner, we next investigated the growth factor effect on coimmunoprecipitating PKC activity. HER1-2-expressing NIH 3T3 cells were cultured overnight in low serum medium and then stimulated with EGF or vehicle prior to lysis and immunoprecipitation with mAb 108.1. The immunoprecipitates were washed and subsequently incubated in t"

The inhibitors also abrogate NF-κB activation by the phosphoseryl/threonyl protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid in U-937 cells. Inhibition of NF-κB activation is not due to a general inhibitory effect since neither pervanadate nor phenylarsine oxide treatment affected the constitutive DNA-binding activity of the transcription factors octamer-1 and cAMP response element-binding protein in U-937 cells, nor did these compounds inhibit the TNF-induced phosphorylation of proteins, viz. hsp-27, eukaryotic initiation factor 4e, and pp19, in MRC-5 fibroblasts. Overexpression of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase HPTPα resulted in a constitutive nuclear NF-κB-like DNA-binding activity in REF cells. Conversely, treatment of human protein-tyrosine phosphatase α-overexpressing cells with phenylarsine oxide led to a loss of the constitutive NF-κB activity. The presence of a tyrosine phosphorylation site on the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB-α) suggested that it could be a target for TNF/okadaic acid-induced tyrosine dephosphorylation. However, no tyrosine phosphorylation was detected on IκB-α from unstimulated cells, while TNF/okadaic acid-treated cells showed increased phosphorylation of IκB-α exclusively at serine residue(s). Treatment of cells with pervanadate inhibited TNF-induced IκB-α phosphorylation and degradation, whereas the serine protease inhibitors tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone and Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone prevented TNF-induced IκB-α degradation and NF-κB nuclear translocation, but not the TNF-induced phosphorylation of IκB-α.

Stable cells lines expressing these truncation mutants in Chinese hamster ovary 58 cells were isolated and characterized. CT314 was predominantly soluble in control cells but became membrane-associated in cells treated with oleate, which also causes translocation of wild-type cytidylyltransferase. CT236 was found to be soluble both in control cells and in cells treated to cause translocation. These results strongly suggest that the membrane-binding site is located within residues 237-314. When assayed for activity in vitro, the mutant forms were catalytically active in the presence of exogenous lipids. CT236, moreover, was as active in the absence of lipids as in their presence, whereas CT314 required lipids for activity. The rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis in cells expressing CT236 was considerably higher than in wild-type cells, consistent with the enzyme being constitutively active in the cells.

The major pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in mammalian cells is the CDP choline pathway. The formation of the activated intermediate, CDP choline, is catalyzed by the second enzyme of the pathway, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.15), which is a key regulatory enzyme for this pathway(1Kent C.

The soluble form is intranuclear, and the membrane form is associated with the nuclear envelope(8Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol.

When assayed in vitro, the soluble form requires lipids for activity, whereas the membrane form is usually quite active in the absence of exogenous lipids. Thus it appears that the soluble form is an inactive reservoir available to be activated when an increased requirement for phosphatidylcholine synthesis is sensed. The soluble form is highly phosphorylated and translocation of cytidylyltransferase to membranes is accompanied by extensive dephosphorylation(14Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol.

A comparison of the mammalian and yeast sequences reveals a region from residues 79-209 that is highly conserved and is proposed to be the catalytic domain(21Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. LaChance A.C. Cornell R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). That this region is catalytic is supported by the similarity of this region to a small bacterial CTP:glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase that is only as big as the putative catalytic domain of the eukaryotic cytidylyltransferases (24Pooley H.M. Abellan F.X. Karamata D. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Mauel C. Young M. Karamata D. J. Gen.

Chem. 1995; 270: 354-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1).Between the phosphorylation region and the catalytic domain is a sequence of about 80 residues that is predicted to form amphipathic α-helices(21Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. LaChance A.C. Cornell R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cornell and co-workers proposed that this amphipathic helical region is a membrane-binding domain for cytidylyltransferase (21Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. LaChance A.C. Cornell R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, Craig et al., (28Craig L. Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3311-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed by chymotryptic digestion that there is a correlation between the presence of the amphipathic helical region in a proteolytic fragment of cytidylyltransferase and the ability of the fragment to bind to lipids in vitro. The digested enzyme was not reported to be active, however, so it was not clear if the protease caused such a major structural change in the enzyme that a membrane-binding site distinct from the helical region might have been altered. Furthermore, it is not clear if binding to lipids in vitro occurs by the same mechanisms as binding to the nuclear envelope in vivo.In the present manuscript we have expressed and characterized truncated forms of cytidylyltransferase that are missing either the phosphorylation region (CT314, Fig. 1) or both the phosphorylation region and the amphipathic helical region (CT236). The truncated enzymes were examined for activity in vitro, subcellular location, ability to translocate, and ability to complement the phenotypes of a cell line in which the endogenous cytidylyltransferase is temperature-sensitive.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsSodium oleate, phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Ham's F-12 medium were purchased from Sigma. 32Pi was obtained from ICN, and [methyl-14C]choline chloride and [methyl-3H]choline chloride were from Amersham.

G418-resistant clones were screened for expression of cytidylyltransferase by immunofluorescence(27Wang Y. MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 354-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cytidylyltransferase was nuclear in all clones examined. Western blot analysis showed that the truncated cytidylyltransferase forms had a faster mobility than wild-type cytidylyltransferase, as expected (Fig. 2). To confirm that the COOH-terminal truncations of cytidylyltransferase did not create new phosphorylation sites, cytidylyltransferase was immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled cells. As expected, wild-type cytidylyltransferase was highly phosphorylated, whereas the two truncation mutants were not labeled at all (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Mobility and phosphorylation of wild-type cytidylyltransferase and truncation mutants. Cells were labeled at 34°C, immunoprecipitated, electrophoresed, and blotted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, Western blot; B, autoradiogram of the blot.

Enzymatic activity in crude extracts was measured in the presence of activating lipids, and the amount of cytidylyltransferase protein was quantitated from Western blots (Table1). In the presence of the activating lipids, each mutant was quite active; there was no significant difference in mutant and wild-type activity.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Subcellular Location of Truncation MutantsThe distribution of wild-type and mutant cytidylyltransferase activities between soluble and membrane-associated forms was determined (Table2). The differences in the specific activities of the three cytidylyltransferase forms reflect the different expression levels of the transfectants. In untreated cells, wild-type cytidylyltransferase was mostly soluble, as expected, as was CT236. The majority of CT314 was also soluble, although more CT314 than wild type was membrane-associated, presumably because CT314 resembles the dephosphorylated form of cytidylyltransferase, which has an increased affinity for membranes.1 When cells were treated with oleate, extensive translocation was observed with the wild-type enzyme and CT314. Very little translocation was observed with mutant CT236, indicating that this mutant remains soluble even when wild type and CT314 translocated. Furthermore, CT236 remained soluble when treated with phospholipase C, a treatment previously shown to cause translocation of cytidylyltransferase(4Sleight R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10644-10650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sleight R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 831-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), even though wild type and CT314 both translocated when treated with phospholipase C (data not shown). Because the difference between CT236 and CT314 is the amphipathic helical region, this evidence strongly supports the concept that this is the membrane-binding region in vivo.TABLE II Open table in a new tab Western blots of soluble and particulate fractions confirmed that the distribution of cytidylyltransferase protein followed that of cytidylyltransferase activity (Fig. 3). Identical distributions in control and oleate-treated cells were observed by Western blotting for two different clonal isolates of each truncation mutant, indicating that the distributions in Table2 were a property of the truncated enzyme and not an artifact of the specific clone (data not shown).Figure 3:Subcellular distribution of cytidylyltransferase protein. Cells were treated in the absence (A) or the presence (B) of oleate at 40°C and harvested as described in Table1. Identical volumes of the cell extracts were subjected to electrophoresis. This experiment was performed twice with the clonal isolate used here and once with a different clonal isolate for each mutant. Similar results were also obtained with a transient transfection. From the left the lanes correspond to wild-type soluble, wild-type particulate, CT314 soluble, CT314 particulate, CT236 soluble, and CT236 particulate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CT236 Is Constitutively Active in VitroBecause the absence of the putative amphipathic helix largely precludes membrane binding in the cell by CT236, it was of interest to know if the truncated enzyme was still lipid-activated. The ratio of activity in the presence of lipids to activity in the absence of lipids for the wild-type and truncated enzymes was determined (Table3). Assays were carried out with crude cell extracts and cytosols, as well as with enzyme purified by immunoprecipitation. Although the wild-type enzyme and CT314 required lipids for full activation, CT236 was as active in the absence of lipids as in the presence of lipids. Because the truncated enzymes were essentially fully active in the presence of exogenous lipids (Table1), CT236 must be constitutively activated. These results indicate that the membrane-binding domain is actually inhibitory to wild-type cytidylyltransferase.TABLE III Open table in a new tab CT236 Is Active in VivoIf CT236 is active when assayed in the absence of lipids, then it might be more active than the soluble form of wild-type cytidylyltransferase in vivo. To determine if CT236 were more active in vivo, a pulse-chase experiment was performed to compare rates of incorporation of [3H]choline into choline-labeled metabolites in cells expressing wild-type cytidylyltransferase and the truncation mutants (Fig. 4, A-E). The rate of incorporation into phosphatidylcholine was appreciably higher in cells expressing CT236 than in cells expressing wild type or CT314. The ratio of labeled CDP choline to phosphocholine was much higher at all time points for CT236, indicative of the increased rate of the cytidylyltransferase reaction. Furthermore, there was a considerably higher rate of glycerophosphocholine labeling in CT236, suggestive of increased turnover of phosphatidylcholine. An increase rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis in cells expressing CT236 was also observed in an experiment in which cells were continuously labeled with [3H]choline (Fig. 4F).Figure 4:Incorporation of [3H]choline into cells expressing wild-type and mutant cytidylyltransferases.

Kent C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cell lines of CHO 58 stably expressing the truncation mutants were tested for their abilities to grow at 40°C (Fig. 5). Both truncation mutants were fully capable of supporting growth at 40°C.Figure 5:Cell growth at 40°C. Stable cell lines expressing wild-type or mutant cytidylyltransferases were plated at 2 × 104 and incubated at 34°C for 1 day and then shifted to 40°C for the indicated time. Viable cells were determined by trypan blue exclusion. Two dishes were counted each day. Symbols are as in Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThese studies have characterized two truncation mutants of cytidylyltransferase in which the enzyme was shortened by either 53 or 131 residues, a reduction in length of 14 or 36%, respectively. The catalytic activities of these truncation mutants were quite similar to that of wild-type cytidylyltransferase, however. This supports the concept that the catalytic region is truly a structurally distinct domain that can exist by itself as a catalytically active unit. The fact that these mutants were active also indicated that the truncations did not cause a global structural alteration in enzyme structure and allowed us to use the truncation mutants to investigate the functions of the regions that were deleted.When the truncation mutants were expressed in stable cell lines, their subcellular distribution was altered compared with that of the wild type. The extent of membrane association was higher for mutant CT314 (about 20%) than for wild-type cytidylyltransferase (about 5%), consistent with the concept that the dephosphorylated enzyme has a higher affinity for membranes. This behavior has been previously observed with a cytidylyltransferase mutant in which all 16 phosphorylation sites were mutated from Ser to Ala.1 Like the 16S→A mutant, 316S→A indicates a mutant in which 16 serines have been mutated to alanine. a high proportion CT314 was soluble even in control cells, further indicating that dephosphorylation per se does not trigger membrane binding.The most striking feature of the subcellular location of the truncation mutants was the fact that CT236 was soluble, even in cells treated to cause the enzyme to translocate. The fact that this enzyme remains soluble but active provides very strong support for the hypothesis that the putative amphipathic helical structure that is predicted to be formed by residues 236-315 constitutes the membrane-binding domain of cytidylyltransferase(18Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. LaChance A. Aebersold R. Cornell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6029-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It might be argued that the amphipathic helical region only affects membrane binding indirectly, for instance by influencing the region amino-terminal of the catalytic domain to form the actual membrane-binding domain. The fact that a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 236-293 can bind to lipid vesicles that activate cytidylyltransferase but not those that do not activate, however, supports the hypothesis that the amphipathic helical region itself is truly the membrane-binding domain(37Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4327-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The involvement of amphipathic helices in membrane binding is a relatively new concept that is strongly supported by the crystal structure of prostaglandin H synthase, in which amphipathic helices are proposed to mediate membrane binding(38Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M."
https://openalex.org/W1603925927,"As in other fish, the cathodic hemoglobin of the eel Anguilla anguilla is considered to play an important role in oxygen transport under hypoxic and acidotic conditions. In the absence of phosphates this hemoglobin shows a reverse Bohr effect and high oxygen affinity, which is strongly modulated over a wide pH range by GTP (whose concentration in the red blood cells varies with ambient oxygen availability). GTP obliterates the reverse Bohr effect in the cathodic hemoglobin. The molecular basis for the reverse Bohr effect in fish hemoglobins has remained obscure due to the lack of structural data. We have determined the complete amino acid sequence of the α and β chains of the cathodic hemoglobin of A. anguilla and relate it to the oxygen equilibrium characteristics. Several substitutions in crucial positions are observed compared with other hemoglobins, such as the replacement of the C-terminal His of the β chain by Phe (that suppresses the alkaline Bohr effect) and of residues at the switch region between α and β subunits (that may alter the allosteric equilibrium, thus causing the high intrinsic oxygen affinity and low cooperativity). The residues binding organic phosphate in the β cleft of fish hemoglobins are conserved, which explains the strong effect of GTP on oxygen affinity and suggests that these residues contribute to the reverse Bohr effect in the absence of alkaline Bohr groups.

Fish hemoglobin (Hb) systems commonly exhibit functional heterogeneity, which appears to be adaptive to oxygen (O2) transport under varying environmental and physiological conditions (55Weber R.E. Comp. Physiol. 1990; 6: 58-75Google Scholar). In eel such differentiation between individual Hb components may favor an efficient O2 transport during exercise stress and migration between fresh and sea water or overland, when severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis occurs (45Powers D.A. Edmundson A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 27Hyde D.A. Moon T.W. Perry S.F. J. Comp. Physiol. B Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 1987; 157: 635-642Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Eel Hb thus is well suited for studying molecular and functional adaptations of fish Hbs to environmental conditions, physiological requirements, and mode of life. The hemolysate from the European eel Anguilla anguilla resolves into two major types of Hb components, an electrophoretically “cathodic” Hb (HbC) with high isoelectric point and an “anodic” fraction with low isoelectric point. As in the trout Hb system that has been intensively characterized in terms of molecular structure and oxygenation properties (e.g. 5Binotti I. Giovenco S. Giardina B. Antonini E. Brunori M. Wyman J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 142: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar and 60Weber R.E. Wood S.C. Lomholt J.P. J. Exp. Biol. 1976; 65: 333-345PubMed Google Scholar), the cathodic Hb fraction of eels displays high O2 affinity and low pH sensitivity (a small Bohr effect), which appear to safeguard O2 loading in the gills under hypoxic and acidotic conditions, whereas the anodic fraction displays a low affinity and a pronounced Bohr effect (59Weber R.E. Lykkeboe G. Johansen K. J. Exp. Biol. 1976; 64: 75-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the cathodic Hb of trout (HbI), which is insensitive to organic phosphates, that of the eel shows greater sensitivity to the endogenous red cell phosphates GTP and ATP than does the anodic Hb (59Weber R.E. Lykkeboe G. Johansen K. J. Exp. Biol. 1976; 64: 75-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another peculiarity of eel HbC is a reverse Bohr effect. A reverse Bohr effect has been demonstrated in few other cases, namely in cathodic Hbs from the the American eel, Anguilla rostrata (23Gillen R.G. Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1961-1969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the Amazonian catfishes Pterygoplichthys pardalis (34Martin J.P. Bonaventura J. Brunori M. Fyhn H.J. Fyhn U.E.H.

Physiol. 1979; 62A: 219-226Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and Mylossoma sp. (21Garlick R.L. Bunn H.F. Fyhn H.J. Fyhn U.E.H. Martin J.P. Noble R.W. Powers D.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1979; 62A: 219-226Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), where the first mentioned two species are facultative air breathers and H. littorale is an obligate air breather. A reverse Bohr effect has also been observed in some amphibians, as in Hbs from bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) tadpoles (2Atha D.H. Riggs A. Bonaventura J. Bonaventura C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3393-3400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the primitive salamander, Amphiuma means (7Bonaventura C. Sullivan B. Bonaventura J. Bourne S. Nature. 1977; 265: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the newts Triton crisatus (37Morpurgo G. Battaglia P.A. Leggio T. Nature. 1970; 225: 76-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and Triturus crisatus carnifex (12Condò S.G. Giardina B. Lunadei M. Ferracin A. Brunori M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 120: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The occurrence of reverse Bohr effect Hbs in air-breathing fishes and in amphibians that still possess gills, such as tadpoles and salamanders, suggests an implication of these Hbs in the transition from water to air breathing, given that air breathing in fishes is induced by water hypoxia and associated with episodes of internal acidosis. An increase in the Hb O2 affinity at low pH (reverse Bohr effect) indicates that oxygenation is associated with proton binding rather than proton release as occurs in Hbs with a normal alkaline Bohr effect. This suggests that reverse Bohr effect Hbs have alternative ionizable groups or that their alkaline Bohr groups are radically modified. In deoxy human HbA, proton binding responsible for the alkaline Bohr effect occurs primarily at the N terminus of the α chain (Valɑ1(NA1)) and at the C-terminal histidine of the β chain (Hisβ146(HC3)) (38Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar; 46Riggs A.F. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 181-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar; 51Shih D.T.-b. Luisi B.F. Miyazaki G. Perutz M.F. Nagai K. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas the endogenous phosphate (DPG) binds at the N terminus of the β chain (Valβ1(NA1)), Lysβ82(EF6), and His143β(H21) that face the central cavity of the Hb molecule (38Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar; 1Arnone A. Nature. 1972; 237: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The last mentioned residue is considered to be responsible for the reverse, “acid” Bohr effect, which in human HbA occurs at pH lower than 6.5 (40Perutz M.F. Kilmartin J.V. Nishikura K. Fogg J.H. Butler P.J.B. Rollema H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 649-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The basic molecular mechanism of the reverse Bohr effect in fish and amphibian Hbs is still obscure because of the lack of structural data on these Hbs. Apart from the amino acid sequences of the α and β chains of the Hb from the tadpole of the bullfrog R. catesbeiana (53Watt K.W.K. Maruyama T. Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3294-3301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 53Watt K.W.K. Maruyama T. Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3294-3301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), sequences for Hbs with reverse Bohr effects are not available, and only the C-terminal residues in A. rostrata (23Gillen R.G. Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1961-1969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and A. means (7Bonaventura C. Sullivan B. Bonaventura J. Bourne S. Nature. 1977; 265: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) Hbs have been identified. In this paper we report the complete amino acid sequence of the α and β chains of A. anguilla cathodic Hb and new information on oxygenation properties of this Hb. The elucidation of its primary structure provides a structural basis for comprehending the special functional properties of this Hb and provides insight into the mechanism of the reverse Bohr effect. Specimens of A. anguilla were received from a local pisciculturist and kept at 15°C in running freshwater in aquaria at the Zoophysiology Department, Aarhus University, for at least 2 weeks before blood sampling. Blood was drawn from the caudal vessels into heparinized syringes. The red blood cells were washed three times in 0.9% NaCl and hemolyzed by addition of 3 volumes of 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.1. After centrifugation (10 min at 14,000 rpm), the cathodic Hb (HbC) was stripped from organic phosphates and separated from the anodic Hb fraction by FPLC 1The abbreviations used are: FPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyRP-HPLCreverse phase high performance liquid chromatographyR staterelaxed stateT statetense state. anion exchange chromatography on a HiLoad 16/10 Q Sepharose Hi Performance column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described previously (Feuerlein and Weber, 1994). The separated HbC was then dialyzed against three changes of CO-equilibrated 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.7, containing 0.5 mM EDTA. No oxidation was evident from the visible spectrum. The Hb solution was divided into small aliquots that were stored at −80°C until use (within 14 days). Control experiments showed no effect of freezing on O2 affinity and cooperativity (see “Results”). fast protein liquid chromatography reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography relaxed state tense state. The molecular weight of HbC was analyzed on a FPLC Sephacryl 16/10 (Parmacia) column equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.1, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The HbC sample was injected at 0.1 mM heme concentration. The elution time was compared with that of human HbA. Globin chains of the cathodic Hb were precipitated according to the acid/acetone method (49Rossi Fanelli A. Antonini E. Caputo A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 30: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) but using 20 mM HCl (instead of 5 mM) in acetone and incubating the acid/acetone-Hb mixture at −80°C for 5 min before centrifugation. The α and β chains were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a Waters μBondapak C18 column (0.39 × 30 cm), using a multistep linear gradient of 70% acetonitrile (solvent B) in 45% acetonitrile containing 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A), at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluate was monitored at 280 nm. Alkylation at the SH residues by 4-vinylpyridine was performed as described (11Caruso C. Rutigliano B. Romano M. di Prisco G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) at 30°C. S-Pyridylethylated α and β chains were digested with trypsin (13D'Avino R. Caruso C. Romano M. Camardella L. Rutigliano B. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The α chain was also cleaved by CNBr (25Gross E. Witkop B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961; 83: 1510Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were separated by RP-HPLC as described (14D'Avino R. Fago A. Kunzmann A. di Prisco G. Polar Biol. 1992; 12: 135-140Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cleavage at the Asp-Pro bond was performed at 40°C in 70% formic acid for 24 h (31Landon M. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). After cleavage, in sequencing the N-terminal Pro fragment, non-Pro N-terminal residues were blocked by reaction with o-phthalaldehyde (9Brauer A.W. Oman C.L. Margolies M.N. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). RP-HPLC purifications of the fraction not dissolved by 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid after trypsin digestion (“core”) and of the fragments generated after formic acid treatment were achieved by a linear gradient of 80% acetonitrile (solvent B) in 30% acetonitrile containing 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A). Separation on RP-HPLC of the CNBr-generated fragments was obtained using a multistep linear gradient as described (14D'Avino R. Fago A. Kunzmann A. di Prisco G. Polar Biol. 1992; 12: 135-140Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Amino acid composition analyses and automated Edman degradation were performed as described previously (14D'Avino R. Fago A. Kunzmann A. di Prisco G. Polar Biol. 1992; 12: 135-140Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the S-pyridylethylated α and β chains was measured on a Hewlett Packard 5989B quadrupole mass spectrometer, equipped with a Hewlett Packard 59987A electrospray source. Isoelectrofocusing on ultrathin polyacrylamide gel (0.3-mm thickness) in the pH range 3.5-10.0 was performed on a Multiphor II apparatus (Pharmacia) at 15°C, according to the instructions contained in the manual. For the determination of the isoelectric point of HbC, proteins from an isoelectric focusing calibration kit (pH 5.0-10.5; Pharmacia) were run in parallel with the Hb sample. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) was performed according to 30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204784) Google Scholar using linear gradients of 12-16% acrylamide and 6-8 M urea in the lower gel. Oxygen equilibria of the cathodic Hb were measured in 0.1 M HEPES buffer, in the pH range 6.5-8.5, at 20 and 10°C at a final Hb concentration of 100 μM on a heme basis. To obtain stepwise O2 saturation, a modified gas diffusion chamber was used, coupled to cascaded Wosthoff pumps for mixing pure (>99.998%) N2 and air or pure O2 (54Weber R.E. Nature. 1981; 292: 386-387Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). pH values were measured by a Radiometer BMS Mk2 thermostatted electrode (Copenhagen). Sensitivity to Cl− was tested by adding KCl to a final concentration of 0.1 M, which was assayed by coulometric titration (Radiometer CMT 10). The effect of GTP was investigated by adding a large (approximately 50) molar excess compared with the tetrameric Hb concentration. O2 affinity and cooperativity were interpolated from P50 (half-saturation O2 tension) and n50 (slope of the linearized Hill plot (log S/(1 − S) versus log PO2) at half-saturation, where S is the fractional O2 saturation). The cathodic Hb fraction of A. anguilla separated from the anodic one and from the organic phosphates in FPLC anion exchange chromatography, where it eluted unretarded (Fig. 1). In isoelectrofocusing on polyacrylamide gel in the pH range 3.5-10.0 (see Fig. 1, inset) the CO derivative of HbC appeared as a single band with an isoelectric point of 9.05. Globin chain separation on RP-HPLC (Fig. 2) revealed only two peaks corresponding to the α and β chains, consistent with the presence of a single cathodic Hb. Gel filtration experiments on a Sephacryl column revealed the Hb to be tetrameric with no evidence for dissociation. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and RP-HPLC experiments indicate that the cathodic and anodic Hbs have no chains in common. Tryptic peptides of S-pyridylethylated HbC α and β chains were purified by RP-HPLC. All peptides were sequenced and aligned by homology with the corresponding sequences of other fish globin chains. The amino acid compositions deduced from the sequence of the individual tryptic peptides matched those found by amino acid analyses. The primary structure of the α and β chains of the cathodic Hb from A. anguilla is reported in Fig. 3, where the sequence portions elucidated by automated Edman degradation of the intact chain, of the Asp-Pro cleaved chain and of the peptides (obtained after CNBr and trypsin cleavage) are indicated. As in other fish Hbs, the N terminus of the α chain was blocked and thus unavailable to Edman degradation. In the α chain an incomplete trypsin cleavage after Lys7 and Arg31 yielded also the uncleaved T2-T3 and T5-T6 fragments. Again, the peptide bond Lys57-Lys58 was only partially digested, and therefore the peptides T7 and T8 were eluted as double peaks, i.e. one containing and the other lacking an additional Lys residue. The sequences of the tryptic peptides T13 and T6 of the β chain that coeluted in the RP-HPLC purification step were unequivocally established, taking advantage of their different yields (77 and 23%, respectively). Some difficulties were encountered in the elucidation of the amino acid sequence of the penultimate tryptic peptide T16 of the β chain and of the corresponding region of the α chain. In the β chain the peptide T16 was not recovered in sufficient amounts to allow its complete sequencing, and the expected tryptic peptide from Phe129 to Lys140 of the α chain was not recovered at all after RP-HPLC purification. After trypsin digestion of the α chain the peptide from Thr101 to Arg142 was obtained as an uncleaved fragment, despite the presence of Lys128 and Lys140. Its sequencing proceeded up to Lys128. To obtain the sequence of the final segment this fragment was subjected to further subdigestion with CNBr, and the resulting peptide from Asp127 to the C-terminal Arg was sequenced, after a purification step on RP-HPLC. In the β chain the last two residues of the T16 peptide were identified by cleavage of the β chain at the Asp-Pro bond with formic acid, purification of the C-terminal fragment (from Pro100 to Phe146) by RP-HPLC and its subsequent digestion with trypsin. The peptide mixture was then subjected directly to automated Edman degradation without purification, and the complete amino acid sequence of the T16 peptide was elucidated by difference. In another preparation the sequence of the T16 peptide was determined after RP-HPLC purification of the core, where the fragment Leu118-Lys143 coeluted with the (presumably) undigested β globin. The sequence of this fragment (containing the T16 peptide) was determined after reaction of the mixture with OPA at the 6th step of the Edman degradation to eliminate undesired (i.e. non-Pro N-terminal) sequences. The sequence-deduced molecular weights of the S-pyridylethylated α and β chains were 15,338 (including acetylation at the N terminus) and 15,999, respectively. These values are in agreement with the mass of the two globins determined by electrospray mass spectrometry of 15,341 Da for the α chain and 15,997 Da for the β chain (Fig. 4), which is consistent with the presence of an acetyl group at the N terminus of the α chain. Molecular weights of 15,100 and 15,300 obtained for the α and β chains, in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis experiments are in accordance with these measurements. The effects of pH, Cl−, and organic phosphates on the oxygen affinity and cooperativity are shown in Fig. 5. In the absence of Cl− the stripped HbC showed a reverse Bohr effect throughout the pH range investigated (Ø= Δlog P50/ΔpH = +0.2 at pH 7.5), a high O2 affinity (P50 = 1.8 and 0.8 mm Hg at 20°C at pH 8.3 and 6.6, respectively), and a low cooperativity (n50 varying from approximately 2.0 at pH 8.3 to 1.3 at pH 6.6). Chloride ions, whose effect on O2 binding can be more accurately estimated in HEPES (56Weber R.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 1992; 72: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) than in Tris or bis-Tris buffers used in an earlier study (59Weber R.E. Lykkeboe G. Johansen K. J. Exp. Biol. 1976; 64: 75-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), produced a small decrease in the O2 affinity at low pH values and had virtually no effect at pH 8.3. In the presence of chloride O2 affinity was not decreased as pH fell below 7.3. Cooperativity was slightly enhanced by the presence of KCl. The O2 affinity was drastically reduced by GTP (P50 = 11.4 mm Hg at pH 8.3), which is the major allosteric effector in this species and is a more potent effector than ATP (59Weber R.E. Lykkeboe G. Johansen K. J. Exp. Biol. 1976; 64: 75-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of GTP, in the absence and presence of Cl−, raised cooperativity to 2.8. At equimolar ratio to Hb tetramers, GTP virtually obliterated the reverse Bohr effect, whereas a high GTP:Hb ratio induced a slight, normal Bohr effect. Interestingly, the presence of both Cl− and GTP decreased O2 affinity less than GTP alone. O2 affinity and cooperativity values of eel HbC samples that had been frozen at −80°C were the same as in freshly prepared Hb solutions (Fig. 5). O2 affinity of eel blood adapts rapidly to ambient O2 depletion primarily through a decrease in the concentration of organic phosphates, particularly GTP, in the red cells, whereas Hb heterogeneity (number and relative concentration of the individual Hb components) remains the same after hypoxic and normoxic acclimation (61Wood S.C. Johansen K. Nature New Biol. 1972; 237: 278-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar; 59Weber R.E. Lykkeboe G. Johansen K. J. Exp. Biol. 1976; 64: 75-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Related to its higher sensitivity to nucleotide triphosphates, the cathodic Hb from eel plays a major role in the adaptation of the O2 transport function to environmental hypoxia. The associated increase in blood O2 affinity improves O2 loading and the arteriovenous O2 content difference under hypoxia (62Wood S.C. Johansen K. Am. J. Physiol. 1973; 225: 849-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As shown here, phosphate modulation occurs even at high pH, such as results from hyperventilation, which is a primary response in fish subjected to hypoxic conditions (cf. 54Weber R.E. Nature. 1981; 292: 386-387Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In response to variable O2 tensions, O2 affinity of HbC can thus be modulated over a wide pH range by modification of the GTP:Hb ratio. As a result of the high O2 affinity and low pH sensitivity cathodic Hbs will predictably secure O2 loading under internal acidosis induced by exercise stress. Although the physiological significance of eel HbC is clear, the molecular mechanisms governing the regulation of intrinsic O2 affinity of this Hb are not yet understood. The knowledge of the primary structure reported here provides a basis for insight. The reverse Bohr effect observed in A. anguilla cathodic Hb reflects an increase in the affinity for oxygen as pH is lowered, showing that protons have a higher affinity for the oxygenated, relaxed (R) state than for the deoxygenated, tense (T) state. Such effects require that some ionizable amino acid residues increase their pKɑ in the transition from the T to the R state. Likely candidates for such groups are the N termini of both chains and the histidine residues, since these normally have pKɑ values in the pH range in which the Bohr effect is observed. Among the N termini only that of the β chain is available as a Bohr group, since that of the α chain is acetylated. The five histidine residues of the α chain (including the “distal” and “proximal” histidines) are conserved among fish Hbs (as in human HbA). It seems, therefore, unlikely that they are responsible for the reverse Bohr effect, although this possibility cannot be excluded. The β chain has only the two heme-linked histidines, His63(E7) and His92(F8). Remarkably, two important histidine residues found in human HbA are substituted in the β chain of A. anguilla HbC; the C-terminal Hisβ146(HC3), accounting for the major fraction of the alkaline Bohr effect in other Hbs (38Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar; 28Kilmartin J.V. Wootton J.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 766-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar; 50Shih T. Jones R. Bonaventura J. Bonaventura C. Schneider R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 967-974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is replaced by a Phe residue, and His143(H21), which is involved in the reverse acid Bohr effect in human HbA below pH 6.5 (40Perutz M.F. Kilmartin J.V. Nishikura K. Fogg J.H. Butler P.J.B. Rollema H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 649-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), is replaced by Lys. The inhibition of the alkaline Bohr effect that is due to the C-terminal histidine of the β chain seems to be a common feature of several reverse Bohr effect Hbs; Hisβ146(HC3) is replaced by Phe also in the American eel A. rostrata (23Gillen R.G. Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1961-1969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is deleted in A. means (7Bonaventura C. Sullivan B. Bonaventura J. Bourne S. Nature. 1977; 265: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although the C-terminal His residue is conserved in R. catesbeiana tadpole Hb (35Maruyama T. Watt K.W.K. Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3285-3293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the alkaline Bohr effect here is inhibited by the presence of an Asn (instead of Asp or Glu) residue at position 94(FG1) of the β chain, which cannot form the salt bridge with the C-terminal His in the T state. His(HC3)β is preserved in T. crisatus carnifex Hb (12Condò S.G. Giardina B. Lunadei M. Ferracin A. Brunori M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 120: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but no further sequence data are available for this Hb. Sequence data for Amazonian fish Hbs that show a reverse Bohr effect are similarly lacking. Hisβ143(H21) is considered to be largely responsible for the reverse Bohr effect in human and tadpole Hbs. In the deoxy human HbA this residue is located between Lysβ82(EF6) and Lysβ144(HC1), so that its imidazole group has a lower affinity for protons (i.e. a lower pKɑ) than in the oxygenated form (40Perutz M.F. Kilmartin J.V. Nishikura K. Fogg J.H. Butler P.J.B. Rollema H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 649-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In tadpole Hb, position 144 of the β chain is occupied by Ser, which is expected to raise the pKɑ of His143, explaining the occurrence of reverse Bohr effects in tadpole Hb in the pH range 8.5-6.0 and in human HbA below pH 6.5 (53Watt K.W.K. Maruyama T. Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3294-3301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The replacement His143→ Lys in eel cathodic Hb thus indicates a different allosteric mechanism in this Hb. The high O2 affinity and low cooperativity of O2 binding of HbC (Fig. 5) could be due to a destabilized T state relative to the R state. A high O2 affinity may also result, at least in part, from an altered intrinsic affinity in the α and β subunits. In eel HbC some of the residues in contact with the heme groups of the α and β subunits are replaced in comparison with human HbA and other fish Hbs (29Kleinschmidt T. Sgouros J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 579-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar; 11Caruso C. Rutigliano B. Romano M. di Prisco G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the α chain, Leu(FG3) is substituted by Met (as in tuna Hb; 48Rodewald K. Oberthür W. Braunitzer G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and Val(FG5) is replaced by Ile (as in goldfish Hb; 47Rodewald K. Braunitzer G. Hoppe Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1984; 365: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Val(E11), normally present at the distal side of the α heme, is replaced by Ile, as also found in other fish Hb (in HbI and HbIV of trout, in goldfish Hb, and in red gurnard Hb; 8Bossa F. Barra D.

E. coli strain CAG626 (a lon− strain on a SC122 background) was used as host for expression of FKBP12 mutants in the pKEN2 expression vector(22Park S.T. Aldape R.A. Futer O. DeCenzo M.T. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3316-3324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For expression of FKBP13, a cDNA encoding the 13-kDa mature form was used for mutagenesis and expression. cDNA inserts carrying a confirmed mutation were cut out of the pKEN2 vector by BamHI restriction digest, purified from the agarose gel using Gene-Clean kit, and subcloned into BamHI site of the pGEX-2T vector. The 5′ ends of the BamHI-cut vector were dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. Orientation of the insert was determined by restriction digest with PstI. Positive clones were sequenced in their entirety. The GST-fusion expression system allowed us to obtain expression levels of 3-12 mg of the GST-FKBP13 chimera/g of cell paste. Mutant duplex DNA was transformed into XA90 cells for expression and plated on LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Five-ml overnight cultures were started from multiple colonies and grown at 37°C on LB-ampicillin medium. For expression, cultures were grown at 37°C in 2-liter shake flasks or in a 10-liter fermentor (Biostat ED, B. Braun). Culture medium (LB-ampicillin) was inoculated at a density of 1:500 and grown to A600 of 0.5-1.0. Protein expression was then induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside at 1 mM final concentration. Cells were then grown for 15-19 h, and harvested by centrifugation at 4230 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Cell pastes were washed in 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4, and frozen at −70°C. Purification of Wild-type and Mutant Proteins-The purification scheme used for the wild-type and mutant FKBP12 has been described previously(22Park S.T. Aldape R.A. Futer O. DeCenzo M.T. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3316-3324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant FKBP13 were purified by a procedure modified from Smith and Johnson(23Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). Cell paste (9-12 g) was resuspended in 10-15 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, incubated with lysozyme (0.4 mg/g of cell paste, 10 mg/ml stock solution) for 15-20 min at room temperature, sonicated 3 × 30 s at 20% with microtip sonicator, and spun for 15 min at 31,000 × g. Supernatant fractions were transferred to a clean centrifuge tube and spun again to remove residual particulates. The cell pellet was again resuspended in a smaller volume of buffer, sonicated once for 30 s, and centrifuged. The resulting supernatant fractions were pooled. The purification was monitored by peptidyl-prolyl isomerase enzyme activity, using FK506-inhibitable activity to distinguish FKBP13 activity from endogenous cyclophilin activity. All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4°C unless otherwise indicated. The clarified cell lysate was loaded on glutathione-Sepharose column (20 ml bed volume) preequilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline/Triton buffer. The column was washed with at least 10 bed volumes of phosphate-buffered saline and/or until A280 returned to base line. GST fusion protein was eluted with 5 mM glutathione in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, concentrated, and dialyzed overnight versus 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. The >50% pure protein was comprised of two major bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2) corresponding to fusion protein (43 kDa) and free GST (29 kDa). The protein was then subjected to cleavage by thrombin (1.2 NIH units/mg of fusion protein) by incubating at room temperature for 1 h in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2 as described in (23Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and EGTA to 0.025 and 2.0 mM final concentration, respectively. Thrombin-cleaved protein was loaded on a glutathione-Sepharose column (20 ml bed volume) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0; the column was washed with the same buffer, and free FKBP was collected in the flow-through. The remaining GST was retained on the column, while FKBP13 was collected in the flow-through fractions. To remove remaining contaminants, the sample was purified further by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated to ~10 ml and brought to 2 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The sample was then loaded onto a 10 × 100 mm hydrophobic interaction chromatography column (Hydropore-HIC, Rainin) mounted on a Waters 650E HPLC. The conditions used were as described previously(21Itoh S. DeCenzo M.T. Livingston D.J. Pearlman D.A. Navia M.N. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1995; 5 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), except we used a 2-h gradient. All purified proteins were stored in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, at 4°C. 1% polyethylene glycol(8000) was added for longer storage of proteins at −70°C. Measurement of catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase reaction was performed essentially according to Harrison and Stein (29Harrison R.K. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1684-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) with the modifications described previously (22Park S.T. Aldape R.A. Futer O. DeCenzo M.T. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3316-3324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate used for determinations of kcat/Km and inhibition constants (Ki) was Suc-Ala-Leu-Pro-Phe-pNA. kcat/Km and Ki were measured at enzyme concentrations such that kobs was at least 5-fold higher than knon-enz. Stock solutions of FK506 and rapamycin were prepared in Me2SO. Final Me2SO concentration in the peptidylprolyl isomerase assay was 0.5% (v/v). Reactions were initiated with chymotrypsin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Absorbance at 400 nm was monitored at 1-s intervals on a Hewlett-Packard 8452A spectrophotometer with a thermostatted cuvette holder, interfaced to a model 300 Hewlett-Packard computer. The calcineurin assay was performed essentially as described by Klee and Cohen(30Klee C.B. Cohen P. Mol. Aspects Cell Regul. 1988; 5: 225-248Google Scholar). A commercial preparation of bovine brain calcineurin was used (Sigma, catalog no. C-1907, specific activity = 16 nmol/min/mg under the conditions of the assay). Radiolabeled phosphorylated peptide substrate, derived from the serine phosphorylation site sequence of the RII subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, was prepared as described previously(9Aldape R.A. Futer O. DeCenzo M.T. Jarrett B.P. Murcko M.A. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16029-16032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The serine phosphatase assay was performed in 60 μl of buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 M NaCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin(30Klee C.B. Cohen P. Mol. Aspects Cell Regul. 1988; 5: 225-248Google Scholar). The following ordered additions were made for the assays: 5 nM to 15 μM FKBP, 5 nM to 15 μM FK506, 160 nM bovine calmodulin (Sigma, catalog no. P-2277), and 40 nM bovine brain calcineurin. 32P-Labeled phosphorylated peptide was added to 1-2 μM final concentration, followed by a 15-min incubation at 30°C. Reactions were quenched with 540 μl of 0.1 M potassium phosphate, 5% trichloracetic acid (w/v). Cation-exchange columns (Dowex AG1-X8, 0.6 ml) were used for separation of free 32Pi(31Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B. Chad J. Wheal H. Molecular Neurobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1991: 135-149Google Scholar). The quenched reaction mixtures (0.6 ml) were applied to the columns, followed by a 0.6-ml H20 wash, and the effluents were collected in scintillation vials and counted with 5 ml of scintillation mixture (Beckmann Liquiscint). All assays were performed in duplicate. Affinity of the mutant FKBP•FK506 complexes for calcineurin was determined by varying the concentrations of mutant FKBP and FK506 at 30°C, using a drug/FKBP ratio of 1.35:1. FK506/FKBP ratios were increased appropriately for the lower affinity mutants to ensure saturation of the mutant FKBP with drug. Control reactions at 30°C were run in the presence of the same concentration of Me2SO (0.1% (v/v)) as reactions containing FK506. For the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase reaction data, absorbance data points were fit to a first-order function using Hewlett-Packard data analysis software. Ki values were calculated using nonlinear fitting to a competitive tight-binding equation (32Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 185: 269-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) using KineTic software version 3.0 (BioKin, Ltd.) running on a Macintosh IIcx. An example of a fit of Ki data is shown in Fig. 3A. In control experiments with the homogeneous major isoform (Aα) of bovine calcineurin (provided by M. Fitzgibbon and J. Thomson, Vertex), we developed an active site titration method for determining active calcineurin concentration. We observed identical inhibition constants (Kic = 5.5-6 nM) for the commercial bovine and homogenous Aα isoform preparations. The inhibition constant for calcineurin by the mutant FKBP•FK506 complexes (Kic) was calculated by computer-fitting the fractional inhibition data as a function of concentration of free FKBP mutant and FK506 to an the equilibrium equation derived by Liu et al.(33Liu J. Albers M.W. Wandless T.J. Luan S. Alberg D.G. Belshaw P.J. Cohen P. MacKintosh C. Klee C.B. Schreiber S.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3896-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Quadratic equations were first used to calculate the free concentrations of these reaction components from the concentrations of calcineurin, FKBP mutant, and FK506 in the experiment, as well as the Ki of the FKBP mutant for FK506. A rearranged form of Equation 7 from (33Liu J. Albers M.W. Wandless T.J. Luan S. Alberg D.G. Belshaw P.J. Cohen P. MacKintosh C. Klee C.B. Schreiber S.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3896-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) was then used to calculate the calcineurin affinity of the FKBP mutant•FK506 complex: I/(1 − I) = [FK506]free[FKBP12]free/(KiKic), where I is the fractional inhibition of calcineurin, and (1 − I) is the fractional activity remaining. Kic and the associated standard deviation were calculated from linear regressions performed on MiniTab (Addison-Wesley). A replot of calcineurin inhibition data to the above equation is shown in Fig. 3B. Human FKBP13 is a membrane-associated protein that contains a 21-residue N-terminal signal peptide(7Jin Y.-J. Albers M.W. Lane W.S. Bierer B.E. Schreiber S.L. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6677-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment of FKBP13 that we used for mutagenesis and expression did not contain the sequence for the signal peptide and thus produced a mature form of the protein of 13 kDa molecular mass. A GST-fusion expression system allowed us to obtain expression levels of 3-12 mg of the GST-FKBP13 chimera/g of cell paste. Induction of the cell culture at higher optical density (A600 of 0.9-1.1) with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside helped to increase expression level. We used a purification scheme for FKBP13 proteins that was modified from one developed for isolation of foreign polypeptides as GST fusion proteins(23Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). Affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose column allowed us to obtain fusion protein that was >50% homogeneous in a single purification step. Two major bands of mobilities corresponding to 43 and 29 kDa were visualized on the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2), corresponding to the fusion protein and free GST, respectively. The same glutathione Sepharose column was used in a second purification step after thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein. Most of the GST was retained on the column, while GST-free FKBP 13 was collected in the flow-through fractions. However, the protein obtained at this step was still slightly contaminated with free GST and other minor protein species. To remove these impurities, we used hydrophobic interaction chromatography as a final purification step. FKBP13 mutants resulting from this purification scheme were ≥95% pure as determined by densitometry of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). Each FKBP12 mutant generated in this investigation was also purified to homogeneity by methods described previously(9Aldape R.A. Futer O. DeCenzo M.T. Jarrett B.P. Murcko M.A. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16029-16032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Park S.T. Aldape R.A. Futer O. DeCenzo M.T. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3316-3324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to make conservative mutations of FKBP12 binding pocket and surface residues (Fig. 1). All FKBP12 and FKBP13 mutants produced in this investigation are active catalysts of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase reaction. Mutation of two hydrophilic residues in the solvent-exposed interface of the binding pocket cause more significant decreases in peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity. The D37V mutant has 10% of the catalytic efficiency of the wild-type protein. The R42I mutant has approximately 60% of the specific activity of the wild-type protein, while the other Arg-42 mutants affect activity less. Of the His-87 mutations, only H87L significantly decreases the catalytic efficiency. Specific activities of FKBP13 variants range from 39 to 110% of the wild-type protein (Table1). Only a few of these mutations, however, cause greater than 2-fold decreases in the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of this reaction.Table I Open table in a new tab The D37V surface residue mutant has an affinity for FK506 and rapamycin 580- and 180-fold lower, respectively, than the wild-type protein (the most dramatic change in drug affinity caused by a point mutation that we have observed). This effect is likely due to disruption of the electrostatic interaction formed by Asp-37 carboxylate oxygen and the Arg-42 guanidino NH in the FK506 and rapamycin complexes(15Wilson K.P. Yamashita M.M. Sintchak M.D. Rotstein S.H. Murcko M.A. Boger J. Thomson J.A. Fitzgibbon M.J. Black J.R. Navia M.N. Acta Crystallogr. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar, 16Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). The R42I and R42K mutants have unaltered affinities for FK506, while R42I has a 20-fold lower affinity for rapamycin than the wild-type protein. However, mutation of this residue to Gln, the residue found at the homologous position in FKBP13, causes a greater loss in affinity for these ligands (Table1). Mutation of the His-87 surface residue to either Phe, Val, or Ala has little effect on the specific activity or affinity of FKBP12 for ligands. However, mutation of this residue to Leu decreases FK506 affinity 40-fold and rapamycin affinity 100-fold. Mutations at the Ile-90 surface residue of FKBP12 have minimal effects on drug binding. We have reported that mutation of FKBP12 surface residue His-87 to Val decreases calcineurin affinity 4-fold(9Aldape R.A. Futer O. DeCenzo M.T. Jarrett B.P. Murcko M.A. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16029-16032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently we generated three more mutations at this residue and observed that each of them decreases calcineurin binding by no more than 2-fold (Table1). We do not observe inhibition of calcineurin by the wild-type FKBP13•FK506 complex at concentrations up to 10 μM. To determine whether mutation of the corresponding residue of FKBP13 to His confers calcineurin affinity to that protein, we expressed and purified the single FKBP13 A95H mutant. Its FK506 complex does not inhibit calcineurin. However, we determined that mutation of two other FKBP13 residues to their FKBP12 counterparts (Q50R and K98I) generate potent inhibitors of calcineurin when complexed with FK506 (Ki values of 100 and 23 nM, respectively), representing a gain of at least 3 orders of magnitude in calcineurin affinity relative to the wild-type protein. The reverse mutation of FKBP12, I90K, results in 2600-fold loss in calcineurin affinity without affecting affinity of this mutant to either FK506 or rapamycin. Combination of the two FKBP13 mutations in the double mutant Q50R/K98I results in even tighter binding of the FK506 complex to calcineurin (Ki = 16 nM). It is interesting to note that combination of the mutation A95H with either Q50R or with the double Q50R/K98I mutant, increases calcineurin affinity in each case. The FK506 complex of the triple mutant Q50R/A95H/K98I FKBP13 binds calcineurin as tightly (within experimental error) as does wild-type FKBP12. Structure-activity data with FK506 analogs in immunosuppression assays (19Becker J.W. Rotonda J. McKeever B.M. Chan H.K. Marcy A.I. Wiederrecht G. Hermes J.D. Springer J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11335-11339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Bierer B.E. Somers P.K. Wandless T.J. Burakoff S.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1990; 250: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) led to the proposal that the macrolide contained effector elements that are in direct contact with a target protein and responsible for inhibition or antagonism of this protein. Such data, along with the three-dimensional structure of the FKBP12•FK506 complex(35Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Science. 1991; 252: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), enabled identification of the probable effector region of FK506 as the cyclohexyl ring (C26-C34) and the C18-C23 solvent-exposed portion encompassing the C21 allyl group. According to the original proposal, FKBP12 acts as a “presenter” of the immunophilin ligand(36Schreiber S.L. Science. 1992; 251: 283-287Crossref Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Based on our preliminary analysis of FKBP12 mutants as calcineurin inhibitors, we concluded that the actual effector face was a composite of the protein and ligand and must include several FKBP12 protein side chains(9Aldape R.A. Futer O. DeCenzo M.T. Jarrett B.P. Murcko M.A. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16029-16032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This modified hypothesis was later supported and extended (18Yang D. Rosen M.K. Schreiber S.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 819-820Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Becker J.W. Rotonda J. McKeever B.M. Chan H.K. Marcy A.I. Wiederrecht G. Hermes J.D. Springer J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11335-11339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and there is now consensus that the so-called “80s loop” (residues 84 − 91) of FKBP12 is an important binding determinant for calcineurin(1Armistead D.M. Harding M.W. Annu. Rep. Med. Chem. 1993; 28: 207-215Google Scholar, 37Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mutation of the homologous Lys-98 residue of FKBP13 to Ile imparts very high calcineurin affinity to the FK506 complex of that protein. A similar result was reported by Rosen et al.(38Rosen M.K. Yang D. Martin P.K. Schreiber S.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 821-822Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), who argued for the requirement of a simultaneous Pro-97 to Gly mutation to impart high affinity, due to a predicted distortion in the 80s loop of FKBP13. We show here that mutation of Lys-98 alone generates a higher affinity calcineurin inhibitor (Ki = 23 nM) than the double P97G/K98I FKBP13 mutant reported in that work (Ki = 44 nM). A high resolution structure of the K98I mutation in the FKBP13 Q50R/A95H/K98I triple mutant indicates that no such loop distortion is present in the FK506 complex. 4J. P. Griffith, K. P. Wilson, O. Futer, D. J. Livingston, and M. A. Navia, manuscript in preparation. We have also determined that a single mutation of the corresponding Lys-121 residue of FKBP52 to Ile, generates a protein whose FK506 complex has high calcineurin affinity (Ki = 90 nM), whereas the co-complex of wild-type FKBP52 has no endogenous calcineurin affinity(13Peattie D.A. Harding M.W. Fleming M.A. DeCenzo M.T. Lippke J.A. Livingston D.J. Benasutti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10974-10978Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The mutagenesis results reported herein demonstrate that the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase catalytic efficiency of FKBP12 is relatively insensitive to mutation at the active site. All mutants generated in this investigation are catalytically active. We reported previously a 4-fold decrease in calcineurin affinity of the FK506•FKBP12 H87V complex, with no significant decrease in FK506 and rapamycin affinity (9Aldape R.A. Futer O. DeCenzo M.T. Jarrett B.P. Murcko M.A. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16029-16032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was later proposed by Rosen et al.(38Rosen M.K. Yang D. Martin P.K. Schreiber S.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 821-822Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), that the β-branching of the Val side chain should force this residue to occupy a conformation that would introduce strain into the 80s loop. We show here that the FK506 complex of the H87V FKBP12 mutant indeed suffers a greater decrease in calcineurin binding affinity than the FK506 complexes of H87L, H87F, or H87A. Structural analysis of the FK506•FKBP12 H87V complex by x-ray crystallography (21Itoh S. DeCenzo M.T. Livingston D.J. Pearlman D.A. Navia M.N. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1995; 5 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) confirms that the branched Val side chain makes van der Waals' contact with Tyr-82, distorting its position relative to that observed in the wild-type protein. This in turn shifts the position of the 80s loop away from its wild-type position. In concert with the R42K mutation, the H87V mutation can also propagate a change in the FK506 backbone conformation near C16, as well as reorienting the 13- and 15-MeOH groups, as observed in solution by NMR(20Lepre C.A. Pearlman D.A. Cheng J.-W. DeCenzo M.T. Livingston D.J. Moore J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13571-13580Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A second region important for calcineurin binding is composed of residues 40-44 of FKBP12(9Aldape R.A. Futer O. DeCenzo M.T. Jarrett B.P. Murcko M.A. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16029-16032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Becker et al.(19Becker J.W. Rotonda J. McKeever B.M. Chan H.K. Marcy A.I. Wiederrecht G. Hermes J.D. Springer J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11335-11339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) argued for the importance of this region in the effector face of FKBP12•FK506, based on sequence homologies among FKBP12 from different species and structural analysis of an inactive FK506 analog. We showed that mutation of Arg-42 to Lys, Ile, or Gln significantly decreases calcineurin affinity of the FK506 complex, with negligible effects on FK506 affinity. Furthermore, the structure of the FK506•FKBP12 R42I complex3 provides direct evidence that this substitution causes no perturbation in global protein conformation or in FK506 conformation, although higher conformational disorder of the polypeptide backbone is observed in the region of the mutation. However, Yang et al.(18Yang D. Rosen M.K. Schreiber S.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 819-820Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar), who characterized FKBP12/13 chimeras, interpreted their data by claiming that residues within this region were unlikely to play a role in direct interactions with calcineurin, and were only important for conformational effects on other parts of the protein. It has been suggested that these two conflicting hypotheses needed to be resolved(37Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The evidence provided by the mutation of FKBP13 residue Gln-50 to Arg is compelling. This mutation imparts substantial calcineurin affinity to the FKBP13•FK506 complex (Table1). The same mutation on an FKBP13 A95H or A95H/K98I double mutant background also increases calcineurin affinity of these FK506 complexes. In fact the resulting FK506•FKBP13 Q50R/A95H/K98I triple mutant complex has a calcineurin affinity equivalent to that of the FK506•FKBP12 complex within experimental error (Table1). Structural analysis of the Q50R/A95H/K98I triple mutant FKBP13•FK506 complex4 suggests multiple FK506 conformations but a striking overlap of the effector face residues of the triple mutant FKBP13 and wild-type FKBP12. These structural observations support the hypothesis that the 40s loop of FKBP12, and Arg-42 in particular, is part of the calcineurin effector surface of FKBP12. The definitive evidence would be provided, of course, by a high resolution structure of the FKBP12•FK506•calcineurin complex. Such structural and mutagenesis information will be useful in the design of novel FKBP12 peptidyl-prolyl isomerase and calcineurin inhibitors(39Armistead D.M. Badia M.C. Deininger D.D. Duffy J.P.

Thus, 14-hydroxy-retro-retinol (14-HRR) is an intracellular messenger molecule linked to activation and growth regulation of lymphocytes; whereas, anhydroretinol, another natural retro-retinoid, is an antagonist of 14-HRR effects. In this article, we describe the isolation, structure determination, synthesis, and biological properties of a new intracellular retinol derivative, 13,14-dihydroxy-retinol (DHR), which also supports the viability of retinol-deprived lymphocytes. DHR is found in numerous cell lines representing a large cross-section of tissues and animals from insects to mammals. In T lymphocytes the production of DHR and 14-HRR is up-regulated by phorbol ester. DHR is converted to 14-HRR by mild acid treatment, but not by cells; therefore DHR is not a biosynthetic intermediate in the conversion of retinol to 14-HRR. DHR is a distinct end point of retinol metabolism. Although it is linked to cell proliferation, its biological role remains to be determined.

Considering that Neu/ErbB2 alone is not able to functionally couple to heregulin, we looked for the possible involvement of ErbB3 in these neurite outgrowth and tyrosine phosphorylation responses. We found that heregulin stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous ErbB3 protein in PC12 cells and that this phosphorylation, like that of Neu, is greatly enhanced in cells that overexpress Neu. Furthermore, overexpression of ErbB3 in PC12 cells led to heregulin-stimulated neurite extension. In addition to becoming tyrosine-phosphorylated, Neu/ErbB2 and ErbB3 associate with each other, and each associates with the 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85) of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in a heregulin-dependent manner. Thus, Neu/ErbB2 and ErbB3 appear to cooperate to mediate the heregulin signal in PC12 cells. Like heregulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF) also stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of both Neu and ErbB3. However, there are clear differences between the EGF- and heregulin-stimulated phosphorylations of ErbB3. In the heregulin response, two tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of ErbB3 are detected. Of these, only the more quickly migrating form (on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) is found to be associated with Neu, whereas the other, more slowly migrating form is uniquely capable of forming stable complexes with p85. In the EGF response, at least two tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of ErbB3 are detected, but these phosphoproteins have distinctly lower apparent molecular weights compared with the heregulin-stimulated ErbB3 phosphoproteins and do not complex with p85. Thus the formation of a stable ErbB3-p85 complex in PC12 cells is a unique outcome of heregulin signaling that correlates with the differences in cell morphology induced by the activated EGF receptor and the Neu tyrosine kinase.

The subclass 1 receptor tyrosine kinases include the epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviation used is: EGFepidermal growth factor. receptor, the Neu/ErbB2 tyrosine kinase, and the ErbB3 and ErbB4 proteins. This receptor family has received a great deal of attention because of the suspected involvement of different members of the family in the development of human cancers. This has especially been true for Neu/ErbB2. The rat Neu tyrosine kinase was first identified in rat neuroblastomas induced by the chemical mutagenesis of rat embryos(1Bargmann C.I. Hung M.-C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1986; 45: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). More recently, the human homolog of the rat Neu protein, commonly designated ErbB2 (or Her2), has been implicated in the development of human breast and cervical cancers(2Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L. Science. 1987; 235: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (10011) Google Scholar). epidermal growth factor. It is interesting that a variety of studies also have implicated the involvement of receptor tyrosine kinases in developmental processes; the most well known examples being in the development of the compound eye in Drosophila(3Basler K. Christen B. Hafen E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1069-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and in vulval development in Caenorhabditis elegans(4Hill R.J. Sternberg P.W. Nature. 1992; 358: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In the case of Neu/ErbB2, it has been suspected that this tyrosine kinase may play a role in neuronal development, because a putative activator/growth factor for Neu/ErbB2, called heregulin (5Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Vandlen R.L.

Cell. 1993; 72: 801-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Along these lines, we recently have shown that the expression of a transforming version of the Neu tyrosine kinase (where the valine residue at position 664 within the transmembranal domain has been changed to a glutamic acid) is capable of stimulating neurite extension in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells (9Gamett D.C. Cerione R.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have found that the addition of heregulin to PC12 cells that overexpress the normal Neu tyrosine kinase also elicits neurite extension. These results then highlight two important points. The first is that activation of the Neu tyrosine kinase, either by a point mutation or by the addition of its putative activating ligand, elicits a cellular morphology that is similar to that induced by the nerve growth factor receptor (i.e. the Trk tyrosine kinase) but distinct from the cellular effects elicited by the more similar EGF receptor. Thus, PC12 cells offer an excellent model system for distinguishing the specific features of the signaling pathways initiated by Neu/ErbB2 versus the EGF receptor. The second major implication from the original studies of Neu effects in PC12 cells is the fact that the addition of heregulin leads to the apparent activation of the Neu/ErbB2 tyrosine kinase in these cells. This finding indicates that PC12 cells must contain the necessary components for the stimulatory regulation of Neu. This is an important point because we (10Carraway III, K.L. Sliwkowski M.X.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25226-25233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that Neu/ErbB2 alone is not able to functionally couple to heregulin. Rather, it appears that the actual receptors for heregulin are the ErbB3 and ErbB4 proteins, suggesting that heregulin-stimulated heterodimer formation between Neu/ErbB2 and either ErbB3 or ErbB4 is necessary to stimulate Neu/ErbB2 tyrosine kinase activity. In the case of ErbB3, the need for coupling to Neu/ErbB2 is most clear, because ErbB3 by itself has little or no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity(14Guy P. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R. Carraway K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we set out to expand upon these two implications. Specifically, we wanted to determine if the ErbB3 protein participated with Neu/ErbB2 in eliciting neurite extension in PC12 cells, and we set out to identify differences between the signaling cascades initiated by heregulin and those stimulated by EGF. We found that overexpression of either Neu/ErbB2 or ErbB3 renders PC12 cells biochemically and morphologically responsive to heregulin. Neu/ErbB2 and ErbB3 associate with each other, become tyrosine-phosphorylated, and associate with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase after heregulin treatment. The events triggered by heregulin are distinguished from those initiated by EGF by the formation of a tyrosine-phosphorylated ErbB3 species with a retarded electrophoretic mobility and unique ability to complex with p85. PC12 cells (obtained from Dr. M. Chao, Cornell University Medical School) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) was from Transduction Laboratories, anti-c-Neu antibody-3 was from Oncogene Science Inc. (Manhasset, NY), and anti-ErbB4 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-p85 antibody was a generous gift from Drs. L. Cantley and C. Carpenter (Harvard Medical School). Production and use of the 2F12 anti-ErbB3 monoclonal antibody (Neo Markers, Fremont, CA) have been described elsewhere(15Kim H.H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G. J. Biol.

Stably transfected cells were selected in 400 μg/ml (active) antibiotic G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown to near confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum on 150-mm tissue culture dishes. 16-20 h prior to growth factor treatment, media were changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then removed from the dishes by trituration in Hanks' balanced salt solution without calcium or magnesium, pelleted (500 rpm for 5 min), and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum. Cells were dispensed at 1.0 × 107/1.5 ml/microfuge tube. Heregulin (20 nM) or EGF (100 ng/ml) was added, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 5 min. The treatment was ended by plunging the microfuge tubes containing the cells into ice followed immediately by centrifugation to pellet the cells and aspiration of the factor-containing supernatants. The cell pellets were then lysed in Tris-buffered saline with 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM EGTA, 40 mM sodium fluoride, 100 μM ammonium molybdate, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate. The lysates were incubated for 15 min on ice, after which insoluble materials were pelleted in a microfuge (10 min). Each supernatant was then incubated for 2 h on ice with 30 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) and the indicated antibodies. The immune complexes were pelleted, boiled in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8% acrylamide), and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4°C in primary antibody as indicated. Blots were analyzed by ECL (Amersham). The overexpression of the normal rat Neu tyrosine kinase in PC12 cells could be visualized by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis using a specific anti-Neu monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1A). Comparison of lanes 1 and 2 (parental PC12 cells) and lanes 5 and 6 (PC12 cells infected with the cDNA for the normal Neu tyrosine kinase; designated PC12/NeuN) in Fig. 1 indicates that although parental PC12 cells express Neu, a significantly stronger signal is obtained when Western blotting anti-Neu immunoprecipitates from PC12/NeuN cells. This signal is not affected by a 5-min incubation with heregulin in either the parental PC12 cells or the Neu transfectants. Lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 1A also show that Neu is tyrosine-phosphorylated in a heregulin-stimulated manner in parental PC12 cells. As expected, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Neu is stronger in Neu transfectants (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 8), and in fact a doublet is detectable for Neu transfectants treated with heregulin. Given that we previously had shown that the ErbB3 protein, by binding heregulin, enabled Neu to become responsive to heregulin(10Carraway III, K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R. Platko J.V. Guy P.M. Nuijens A. Diamonti A.J. Vandlen R.L. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14303-14306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether the addition of heregulin to PC12 cells stimulated the formation of a complex between Neu/ErbB2 and ErbB3. We approached this in a separate experiment using a monoclonal antibody that is highly specific for ErbB3 and does not cross-react with the rat Neu protein (monoclonal 2F12, (15Kim H.H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24747-24755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); see also Fig. 1C) as the first probe (Fig. 1B). In the parental PC12 cells, we had a difficult time detecting ErbB3 above background and have been unable to draw any conclusions regarding a heregulin-stimulated ErbB3-Neu complex. However, in cells that overexpress Neu, we can clearly detect ErbB3 in the anti-Neu precipitated pellets, and this appears to be a heregulin-stimulated event (see Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). The fact that substantially more of this heregulin-stimulated ErbB3-Neu complex is found in the PC12/NeuN cells compared with the parental PC12 cells suggests that the affinity of Neu for ErbB3 is relatively weak, such that sufficient complex formation can only be detected by immunoprecipitation under conditions where the amount of one or the other of these proteins is relatively high (also see below). The ErbB3 protein can be clearly detected in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 8). Again, the presence of ErbB3 in these pellets is entirely dependent upon the treatment of cells with heregulin, and the amount of ErbB3 is significantly increased in the PC12/NeuN cells compared with parental PC12 cells. Note that the broad ErbB3 band detected in anti-phosphotyrosine precipitates (Fig. 1B, lane 8) appears to contain a component with lesser electrophoretic mobility than that found in the anti-Neu precipitates (this will be considered further below). It should also be noted that although the ErbB4 protein can be detected by Western blotting anti-phosphotyrosine precipitates with a specific anti-ErbB4 antibody, the apparent tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB4 is not stimulated by heregulin in PC12 cells (data not shown). Overall, the data presented in Fig. 1 indicate that the ErbB3 protein interacts with Neu in a heregulin-dependent manner and that ErbB3 either is tyrosine-phosphorylated or associates with a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in a heregulin- and Neu-dependent manner. One simple model consistent with these findings would be that heregulin stimulates the formation of a Neu-ErbB3 heterodimer, which in turn leads to the activation of the Neu tyrosine kinase and to the tyrosine phosphorylation of the ErbB3 protein. Presumably, the formation of this heterodimer would then initiate signaling pathways that account for the heregulin-stimulated neurite extension observed in PC12 cells(9Gamett D.C. Cerione R.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). If this were in fact the case, we would predict that overexpression of ErbB3 would facilitate heregulin-stimulated neurite extension, as was observed upon overexpression of the normal Neu protein. In order to investigate this possibility, lipofection of the bovine erbB3 cDNA was performed to generate stable PC12 cell transfectants that overexpress the ErbB3 protein. As shown in Fig. 2, PC12 cells overexpressing ErbB3 (PC12/ErbB3, clone C59.3) showed neurite extension that was stimulated by heregulin, similar to the response observed with PC12/NeuN cells. Also similar to PC12/NeuN cells is the pattern of ~180-kDa proteins precipitated by the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in a heregulin-dependent manner from PC12/ErbB3 cells (Fig. 3A). Western blotting with specific monoclonal antibodies indicates that these proteins include both Neu and ErbB3 (Fig. 3, B and C). In the case of Neu (Fig. 3B, lane 4), a doublet is detectable in the Western blot (also see Fig. 1A, lane 8), suggesting that there are multiple heregulin-stimulated phosphorylation sites. For ErbB3, we frequently detect a doublet in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of heregulin-stimulated cells, (e.g.Fig. 4); the more quickly migrating band was barely visible, however, in the experiment shown in Fig. 3C. The predominant ErbB3 band detected in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates migrated more slowly than either band detected upon Western blotting these precipitates with the anti-Neu antibody. Taken together, these results suggest that both the Neu and ErbB3 proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated in a heregulin-dependent manner in the ErbB3 transfectants and that a phosphorylated ErbB3 protein has distinctly lesser mobility than either of the phosphorylated forms of the Neu protein.Figure 4:Anti-ErbB3 immunoblots showing association of different forms of ErbB3 protein with Neu and p85. A, lysates from PC12/NeuN (A1.3) were immunoprecipitated with anti-Neu (αNeu) (lanes 1 and 2), and the supernatants after this precipitation were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine (αPY) (lanes 3 and 4). B, the lysate of heregulin-stimulated cells was divided equally for immunoprecipitation with antibodies against phosphotyrosine or p85 (αp85).

Indeed, binding of the ErbB3 cytoplasmic domain to p85 has been demonstrated following EGF stimulation of fibroblasts expressing an EGF receptor-ErbB3 chimera (18Prigent S.A. Gullick W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 19Fedi P. Pierce J.H. DiFiore P.P. Kraus M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 492-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ErbB3 has been shown to interact with p85 following EGF stimulation of MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells (15Kim H.H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24747-24755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and A431 cells(20Soltoff S.P. Carraway III, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Having seen heregulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 in PC12 cells, we wanted to examine whether this would also lead to the interaction of ErbB3 and p85. Furthermore, the previous results (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:) had shown the existence of two or more tyrosine-phosphorylated species of ErbB3 in heregulin-treated cells, whereas only a single ErbB3 band appeared to associate with Neu, thus raising the possibility of distinct roles for the different forms of ErbB3. These questions were addressed by the experiments shown in Fig. 4. Lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 4A show the heregulin-dependent co-precipitation of ErbB3 in anti-Neu immunoprecipitates from lysates of PC12/NeuN cells. The supernatants remaining after anti-Neu precipitation were found to contain an additional, slower mobility ErbB3 band (see Fig. 4A, arrow, lane 4) precipitable by anti-phosphotyrosine. The appearance of this band is absolutely dependent on the addition of heregulin. These results suggest that although Neu and ErbB3 can be co-precipitated from PC12 cells overexpressing Neu, and while ErbB3 may be tyrosine-phosphorylated within this complex, there is a second phosphorylated form of ErbB3 that migrates with slower mobility and is not complexed with Neu (although the generation of this ErbB3 species is dependent on heregulin and is enhanced by overexpression of Neu). Interestingly, we find that it is this ErbB3 species that can be co-precipitated with an anti-p85 antibody (Fig. 4B). Specifically, lane 1 in Fig. 4B shows the ErbB3 doublet obtained when Western blotting an anti-phosphotyrosine precipitate from PC12 cells overexpressing Neu, and lanes 2 and 3 show a similar experiment using a specific anti-p85 antibody to precipitate ErbB3. In direct comparisons, we consistently find that the form of ErbB3 that complexes with p85 has an identical mobility to the upper ErbB3 band detected in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. Again, the ability to co-precipitate ErbB3 and p85 is strictly dependent on heregulin addition to the PC12 cells. These results are consistent with a model where heregulin stimulates the formation of a Neu-ErbB3 complex and the multiple phosphorylation of ErbB3 (see “Discussion”). One phosphorylated form of ErbB3 is able to remain complexed with Neu, whereas a second phosphorylated form, which migrates with a slower mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, dissociates from Neu and is able to form a complex with p85. Given that in other cell systems it has been shown that the EGF receptor can couple functionally to ErbB3 and p85(15Kim H.H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24747-24755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Soltoff S.P. Carraway III, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), we compared the abilities of EGF and heregulin to stimulate the phosphorylation of ErbB3 and its complex formation with p85. The upper panel in Fig. 5A compares the results from Western blot analyses (using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody) where tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated from parental PC12 cells and PC12/NeuN cells, in both the presence and the absence of treatment with heregulin or EGF. The predominant bands observed in these experiments are at ~180 kDa, which is the expected mobility for the EGF receptor and the related Neu and ErbB3 proteins. The EGF-stimulated phosphorylation signals in the parental PC12 cells and in PC12/NeuN cells appeared to be equivalent (compare lanes 3 and 6 in the upper panel of Fig. 5A), whereas, as indicated earlier (e.g.Fig. 1), the heregulin response in PC12/NeuN cells was enhanced relative to the parental PC12 cells (compare lanes 2 and 5 in the upper panel of Fig. 5A). The results obtained in PC12 cells overexpressing Neu also clearly show that the mobilities of the phosphoprotein bands in the ~180-kDa region differ for heregulin-treated cells compared with EGF-treated cells. Heregulin treatment results in phosphoprotein bands that have less mobility than those detected following EGF-stimulation (compare lanes 5 and 6 in the upper panel of Fig. 5A). These results suggest either that different proteins are being tyrosine-phosphorylated upon the addition of EGF versus heregulin and/or that different sites are being phosphorylated on the same proteins. When the same anti-phosphotyrosine precipitates are reblotted with an anti-ErbB3 antibody, the overall profile obtained is very similar to that observed in the anti-phosphotyrosine blot (Fig. 5A, lower panel). This similarity argues that both heregulin and EGF stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 and that the stimulatory effects of heregulin but not EGF are greatly enhanced in PC12 cells overexpressing Neu. In order to be certain that these results were not artifactual due to incomplete stripping of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody prior to reprobing, we repeated the experiment and blotted first with anti-ErbB3 (Fig. 5B). Again, the electrophoretic mobilities of the ErbB3 bands are clearly different for heregulin and EGF treatment (compare lanes 5 and 6 of Fig. 5B). The heregulin-stimulated cells showed the two forms of ErbB3 described above (Fig. 4). The faster mobility ErbB3 band observed upon heregulin treatment co-migrated with the slower mobility EGF-stimulated ErbB3 band. These results suggest that both the EGF receptor and Neu can elicit a common phosphorylation event within the ErbB3 protein and that this phosphorylated ErbB3 species (when generated by heregulin treatment) can remain complexed with Neu. There also is a broad ErbB3 band detected in EGF-treated cells that has a greater mobility than any of the bands detected in heregulin-treated cells. The experiment shown in Fig. 6 tested for the formation of stable complexes between the various phosphorylated forms of ErbB3 seen in heregulin- and EGF-stimulated cells with p85. For this, lysates of parental PC12 cells or PC12/NeuN cells were first immunoprecipitated with an anti-p85 antibody, and the precipitates were blotted with the anti-ErbB3 antibody (Fig. 6, upper panel). The supernatants remaining after the anti-p85 precipitation were then immunoprecipited with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, and these precipitates were also analyzed by blotting with anti-ErbB3 (Fig. 6, lower panel). As shown in the upper panel, we only detect a p85-ErbB3 complex in heregulin-treated cells (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 5) and not in EGF-treated cells (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 6), and this complex is strongly stimulated in PC12 cells overexpressing Neu (compare lanes 2 and 5 of Fig. 6). Again, the mobility of the ErbB3 band that co-precipitates with p85 is identical to the slower mobility ErbB3 band detected in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. When examining the lysates that remain behind following the immunoprecipitation with anti-p85, we see both heregulin- and EGF-stimulated phosphoprotein bands in the ~180-kDa region. Thus, whereas EGF stimulates the phosphorylation of ErbB3 (as indicated in Fig. 5), this phosphorylated ErbB3 species is not able to form a stable complex with p85. As will be discussed further below, these results then point to a model where both the EGF-activated EGF receptor and the heregulin-activated Neu tyrosine kinase can phosphorylate ErbB3 in a distinct manner and that only ErbB3 proteins that have been phosphorylated by Neu can go on to form a stable complex with p85 in PC12 cells. It originally was reported that heregulin, a 144-kDa transmembranal glycoprotein with an EGF-like region within its extracellular domain, was the ligand/growth factor for Neu/ErbB2(5Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Vandlen R.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have indicated that the true receptors for heregulin are the ErbB3 and ErbB4 proteins (10Carraway III, K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R. Platko J.V. Guy P.M. Nuijens A.

Rothwell V.M. Buckley S. Nature. 1993; 366: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and that it is heterodimer formation between Neu and ErbB3 (or Neu and ErbB4) that enables the Neu tyrosine kinase activity to be stimulated by heregulin (11Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L. Carraway III, K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14661-14665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we looked for the possible involvement of ErbB3 or ErbB4 in the neurite outgrowth and tyrosine phosphorylation responses we had previously seen associated with overexpression of Neu in PC12 cells. We found that heregulin stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous ErbB3 protein in PC12 cells and that this phosphorylation, like that of Neu, is greatly enhanced in cells that overexpress Neu. Furthermore, we found that overexpressing the ErbB3 protein in PC12 cells led to heregulin-stimulated neurite extension, similar to the phenotypes obtained upon heregulin addition to cells overexpressing the normal Neu protein or when transforming Neu was expressed in PC12 cells. Two obviously important questions were whether the Neu and ErbB3 proteins actually formed a complex in PC12 cells and if this complex formation was stimulated by heregulin. The results of immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-Neu antibody indicated that the addition of heregulin either to PC12 cells overexpressing Neu or to PC12 cells overexpressing ErbB3 led to the co-precipitation of the Neu and ErbB3 proteins. Thus, overall, these results are consistent with a scheme where heregulin-stimulated heterodimer formation between Neu and ErbB3 results in the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the Neu and ErbB3 proteins (see below) and accounts for the ability of PC12 cells to respond to this growth factor. Because it has been suggested that one of the primary effector/targets for phosphorylated ErbB3 is the 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85) of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(18Prigent S.A. Gullick W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 19Fedi P. Pierce J.H. DiFiore P.P. Kraus M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 492-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Soltoff S.P.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), we set out to determine if heregulin addition to PC12 cells might lead to the formation of an ErbB3-p85 complex. Immunoprecipitation experiments using a specific (precipitating) anti-p85 antibody followed by Western blotting with a specific anti-ErbB3 antibody provided evidence for a direct interaction between these proteins. This interaction was most evident in PC12 cells overexpressing Neu and was heregulin-stimulated. When comparing anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates with anti-85 immunoprecipitates, where in both cases the resuspended pellets were blotted with the anti-ErbB3 antibody, we found that the ErbB3 band that co-precipitated with p85 was identical in mobility to the slowest mobility ErbB3 band detected in anti-phosphotyrosine precipitates. However, this ErbB3 band was not detected in anti-Neu immunoprecipitates. Thus, although it appears that ErbB3 is phosphorylated at multiple tyrosine residues in a heregulin- and Neu-dependent manner, one of these phosphorylated ErbB3 species forms a stable complex with Neu but not with p85. Overall, these results appear to be consistent with the simple scheme depicted in Fig. 7. The binding of heregulin to ErbB3 on the surface of PC12 cells stimulates the formation of a Neu-ErbB3 heterodimer. We would suggest that this results in a higher affinity binding by heregulin (11Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L. Carraway III, K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14661-14665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the stimulation of the Neu tyrosine kinase activity. This in turn increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of Neu, probably at multiple sites (e.g.Fig. 1), and the trans-phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues on ErbB3. The specific mechanism by which heregulin stimulates the phosphorylation of Neu is not clear. One possibility is that Neu is trans-phosphorylated by ErbB3; however, this is problematic because ErbB3 appears to have little or no tyrosine kinase activity(14Guy P. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R. Carraway K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). It may be that within a Neu-ErbB3 heterodimer, a weak kinase like ErbB3 is still able to phosphorylate Neu because of the immediate proximity of the substrate. Once activated, the Neu tyrosine kinase should be able to trans-phosphorylate ErbB3. The timing of this trans-phosphorylation event apparently is important, because the extent of ErbB3 phosphorylation appears to influence whether or not ErbB3 remains complexed with Neu or forms a new complex with p85. In fact, these findings raise the interesting possibility that a specific, heregulin-stimulated trans-phosphorylation of ErbB3 by Neu leads to the dissociation of ErbB3 from the heregulin-Neu-ErbB3 ternary complex and promotes the specific binding of ErbB3 to a potential target, p85. Such a mechanism would be similar to hormone receptor/G protein-mediated signaling cascades where the G protein first becomes activated within a hormone-receptor-G protein ternary complex, but then the activated G protein dissociates from this complex and seeks out its target/effector molecule. It also is interesting that a potential signaling cascade involving ErbB3 and p85 within PC12 cells appears to be specifically initiated by heregulin and not by EGF. Although the addition of EGF to PC12 cells overexpressing Neu leads both to an apparent tyrosine phosphorylation of Neu (data not shown) and ErbB3 (Fig. 5A), neither of these phosphorylated proteins appear to form a stable complex with p85. In the future, it will be interesting to see if the heregulin-Neu-ErbB3-p85 pathway contributes to the specificity observed in the cellular responses triggered by heregulin versus EGF."

However, little [Medline] experimental evidence exists to address the possibility that organisms might have multiple NSF proteins serving distinct functions in the same or different cells.

Here we report that 1) Drosophila contains a second NSF homolog, termed dNSF-2, that exhibits 84% amino acid identity to dNSF-1, 2) dNSF-1 and dNSF-2 display overlapping but different temporal expression, and 3) multiple transcripts are derived from the dNSF-2 gene.

INTRODUCTIONProgress in understanding the mechanisms by which intracellular transport vesicles are targeted to and fuse with the appropriate target membrane has led to the characterization of a protein complex thought to perform these functions. This complex includes the cytosolic NSF 1The abbreviations used are: NSFN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion proteinSNAPsoluble NSF attachment proteinSNARESNAP receptorPCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase(s)dNSFDrosophila NSF. and soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs), the SNAP receptors (SNAREs) present on the vesicle and target membranes, and several other proteins (reviewed in (1Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar)). The SNARE hypothesis states that each specific type of vesicle carries a unique set of SNARE protein isoforms (the vesicle SNARE) that is complementary to a unique SNARE on the appropriate target membrane (the target SNARE) and that interactions of these SNAREs are responsible for the specificity of vesicle targeting(1Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). After targeting, the SNAREs are thought to assemble with the cytosolic NSF and SNAP proteins to form a complex that may mediate fusion.Thus the presence of distinct isoforms of the SNARE proteins is essential to the current hypothesis for targeting and fusion mechanisms. In contrast, NSF has been thought to serve a general function(1Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate the existence of a second NSF gene in Drosophila and raise the possibility that multiple NSF proteins may serve distinct functions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Sequencing of a Novel Drosophila NSFDegenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the conserved NSF peptide sequences HIIIFDE and VIGMTNR were used in PCR to amplify sequences from Drosophila melanogaster genomic DNA. PCR was carried out for 30 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 2 min at 45°C, and 3 min at 72°C in a Perkin-Elmer thermal cycler. The primer corresponding to HIIIFDE contained a SalI linker sequence, and the primer corresponding to VIGMTNR contained an EcoRI linker. These sites were used to clone the 0.16-kb PCR product into a pBluescript vector (Stratagene) for sequencing. A 32P-labeled probe corresponding to the 0.16-kb sequence was used to screen a D. melanogaster (Oregon R) genomic DNA library (constructed by A. Kamb). The hybridizations were carried out in 6 × SSPE and 50% formamide at 42°C, and the filters were washed in 0.2 × SSC at 60°C. Southern analysis of genomic DNA and of the genomic clones (data not shown) identified a 4.2-kb EcoRI restriction fragment containing the sequence amplified by PCR. This EcoRI fragment was used to screen a cDNA library in λ EXLX+ prepared using RNA isolated from 0-24-h Drosophila embryos (library provided by M. Palazzolo and associates, California Institute of Technology). Screening conditions were as described previously(5Ramaswami M. Tanouye M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2079-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A 1.3-kb SacI fragment containing the 5′ end of the largest embryonic cDNA (G1-2) was then used to screen a cDNA library prepared from adult Drosophila head transcripts (library provided by Tom Schwarz, Stanford University) as described(2Ordway R.W. Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5715-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Following purification of phage, cDNAs from the embryonic library were subcloned into a pBluescript vector, and those from the head library were converted to pBluescript plasmid form by autoexcision using the Exassist helper phage system (Stratagene). Sequencing of cDNAs and the 0.16-kb PCR product was carried out either manually (Sequenase kit, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) or using an automated sequencer. The dNSF-2 amino acid sequence (Fig. 1) was primarily derived from the partial open reading frame contained within the embryonic cDNA, G1-2. The amino-terminal 92 amino acids were obtained from an overlapping head library cDNA, dN2.14, which extends the open reading frame in the 5′ direction. Sequences were analyzed using the PILEUP and DISTANCES programs of the Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI) software package (6Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11516) Google Scholar).Northern and Chromosomal in Situ Analysis5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated as described (2Ordway R.W. Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5715-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) from wild type (Canton S) adults, third instar larvae, and mixed stage embryos was separated on a 0.65 M formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Corp.). The blot was hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe derived from either the dNSF-1 cDNA, dN20(2Ordway R.W. Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5715-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), or the dNSF-2 embryonic cDNA, G1-2, and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Hybond-N). In situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes was carried out using the 4.2-kb genomic EcoRI fragment as a probe. The fragment was biotinylated by random primer labeling using biotinylated dUTP in place of dTTP. After binding to streptavidin-conjugated HRP, the hybridization signal was visualized as a peroxidase reaction product using the Detek I HRP kit (ENZO Biochem).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDrosophila genomic DNA sequences related to NSF were amplified by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to the conserved NSF amino acid sequences HIIIFDE and VIGMTNR. A 0.16-kb PCR product was cloned, and subsequent sequence analysis showed that it encodes a polypeptide with homology to the previously identified Drosophila NSF (dNSF). The nucleotide sequence of the amplification product was determined to be 86% identical to the corresponding region of dNSF, suggesting that it was derived from a second Drosophila NSF gene. To characterize this putative second gene further, the PCR product was used as a probe to obtain genomic DNA clones and embryonic cDNA clones as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sequence analysis of two embryonic cDNA clones confirmed that they were derived from a novel Drosophila NSF gene, termed dNSF-2. In situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes localized the dNSF-2 gene to position 87F14-15 on the third chromosome.Since none of the embryonic cDNAs included the 5′ end of the open reading frame, cDNAs extending further 5′ were identified. A probe corresponding to the 5′ most sequence from the largest cDNA, G1-2, was used to perform a high stringency screen of 350,000 recombinant phage from an adult Drosophila head cDNA library. The 43 hybridizing clones detected could be subdivided into two classes: a strongly hybridizing class consisting of 3 members (7% of the total) and a weakly hybridizing class consisting of 40 members (93% of the total). Restriction mapping of two of the strongly hybridizing clones indicated that both were derived from the dNSF-2 gene. In contrast, analysis of seven clones from the weakly hybridizing class indicated that only one was derived from dNSF-2, while the remaining six were from the previously identified dNSF gene, now designated dNSF-1. Thus the cDNAs obtained from the head library using a dNSF-2 probe were predominantly dNSF-1 cDNAs detected by weak cross-hybridization at high stringency. The dNSF-2 gene was not detected as a distinct gene in our previous study(2Ordway R.W. Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5715-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), apparently due to the cross-hybridization between dNSF-1 and dNSF-2 at high stringency and the predominance of dNSF-1 cDNAs in the head library.Restriction mapping of the largest of the head library dNSF-2 cDNAs, a 3.4-kb clone designated dN2.14, indicated that it extends further 5′ than the largest embryonic cDNA (G1-2). The 5′ end of dN2.14 was sequenced through the region of overlap with G1-2 (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the composite amino acid sequence of dNSF-2 is shown in alignment with dNSF-1 in Fig. 1. On the basis of this alignment the two Drosophila NSFs exhibit 84% amino acid identity. An alignment of dNSF-2 with Chinese hamster ovary NSF and the sec18 gene product (not shown) shows that dNSF-2 is 63 and 42% identical to these polypeptides, respectively. For comparison, the dNSF-1 amino acid sequence is 62 and 42% identical to Chinese hamster ovary NSF and sec18, respectively(2Ordway R.W. Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5715-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).To compare the temporal expression patterns of the dNSF-1 and dNSF-2 genes, probes derived from each of these genes were used to carry out Northern analysis of mRNA from Drosophila adults, larvae, and embryos (Fig. 2). A single dNSF-1 transcript of approximately 3.2 kb was found to be abundant in adult mRNA but detected at substantially lower levels in larvae and embryos. Expression of dNSF-2 was assessed using the same blot and was found to differ from that of dNSF-1 in two ways. First, multiple transcripts are derived from the dNSF-2 gene, ranging in size from 2.4 to 3.4 kb. Most prominent in this group are bands of 2.4, 2.8, 3.0, and 3.4 kb. Second, dNSF-2 differs from dNSF-1 in that it is expressed at similar levels in adults and larvae, with little or no expression detected in embryos.Figure 2:Northern analysis of poly(A)+ RNA obtained from wild type (Canton S) adults (A), third instar larvae (L), and embryos (E) using probes derived from either dNSF-1 or dNSF-2.

Size units are kb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our previous work has shown that mutations in the dNSF-1 gene are responsible for the comatose temperature-sensitive paralytic phenotype(3Pallanck L. Ordway R.W. Ganetzky B. Nature. 1995; 376: 25Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which includes an apparent failure of synaptic transmission at an elevated temperature(4Siddiqi O. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3253-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These results, along with functional studies of NSF in other systems, imply a role for dNSF-1 in the regulated exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. The results presented here demonstrate that a second Drosophila NSF, dNSF-2, exhibits 84% amino acid identity with dNSF-1 and that the dNSF-2 gene gives rise to multiple transcripts. Thus at least two Drosophila NSF proteins are derived from these dNSF genes, and future work will assess whether the heterogeneity of dNSF-2 transcripts produces multiple dNSF-2 protein isoforms or serves other functions. We also report here that the temporal expression of dNSF-2 partially overlaps with that of dNSF-1. The abundant expression of both dNSF genes in the adult suggests that both may play important functional roles at this stage. It will be of great interest to determine whether these putative roles are executed in the same or different cell types. It is also of interest to note that the dNSF-1 gene is expressed at much higher levels in adults than in larvae, whereas similar levels of dNSF-2 transcript are detected at these two developmental stages. Furthermore, a low level of dNSF-1 transcript but little or no expression of dNSF-2 is detected in embryos, and the possible existence of additional dNSF genes is now being investigated. The developmental regulation of dNSF gene expression raises the possibility that different NSF functional requirements arise during development and are served by specific NSF gene products. Thus while other studies have suggested that a single NSF protein might serve a universal role in the fusion of intracellular vesicles with target membranes(1Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar), this study suggests more complexity in NSF function. The presence of closely related NSF homologs in Drosophila also raises the possibility that similar complexity exists in vertebrates, a possibility that may explain the apparent existence of multiple secretory mechanisms in some cells (for example, see (7Ikonen E. Tagaya M. Ullrich O. Montecucco C. Simmons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 571-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar)). Further genetic, molecular, and functional analysis will now begin to define the roles of these NSF proteins.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDrosophila genomic DNA sequences related to NSF were amplified by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to the conserved NSF amino acid sequences HIIIFDE and VIGMTNR. A 0.16-kb PCR product was cloned, and subsequent sequence analysis showed that it encodes a polypeptide with homology to the previously identified Drosophila NSF (dNSF). The nucleotide sequence of the amplification product was determined to be 86% identical to the corresponding region of dNSF, suggesting that it was derived from a second Drosophila NSF gene. To characterize this putative second gene further, the PCR product was used as a probe to obtain genomic DNA clones and embryonic cDNA clones as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sequence analysis of two embryonic cDNA clones confirmed that they were derived from a novel Drosophila NSF gene, termed dNSF-2. In situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes localized the dNSF-2 gene to position 87F14-15 on the third chromosome.Since none of the embryonic cDNAs included the 5′ end of the open reading frame, cDNAs extending further 5′ were identified. A probe corresponding to the 5′ most sequence from the largest cDNA, G1-2, was used to perform a high stringency screen of 350,000 recombinant phage from an adult Drosophila head cDNA library. The 43 hybridizing clones detected could be subdivided into two classes: a strongly hybridizing class consisting of 3 members (7% of the total) and a weakly hybridizing class consisting of 40 members (93% of the total). Restriction mapping of two of the strongly hybridizing clones indicated that both were derived from the dNSF-2 gene. In contrast, analysis of seven clones from the weakly hybridizing class indicated that only one was derived from dNSF-2, while the remaining six were from the previously identified dNSF gene, now designated dNSF-1. Thus the cDNAs obtained from the head library using a dNSF-2 probe were predominantly dNSF-1 cDNAs detected by weak cross-hybridization at high stringency. The dNSF-2 gene was not detected as a distinct gene in our previous study(2Ordway R.W. Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5715-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), apparently due to the cross-hybridization between dNSF-1 and dNSF-2 at high stringency and the predominance of dNSF-1 cDNAs in the head library.Restriction mapping of the largest of the head library dNSF-2 cDNAs, a 3.4-kb clone designated dN2.14, indicated that it extends further 5′ than the largest embryonic cDNA (G1-2). The 5′ end of dN2.14 was sequenced through the region of overlap with G1-2 (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the composite amino acid sequence of dNSF-2 is shown in alignment with dNSF-1 in Fig. 1. On the basis of this alignment the two Drosophila NSFs exhibit 84% amino acid identity. An alignment of dNSF-2 with Chinese hamster ovary NSF and the sec18 gene product (not shown) shows that dNSF-2 is 63 and 42% identical to these polypeptides, respectively. For comparison, the dNSF-1 amino acid sequence is 62 and 42% identical to Chinese hamster ovary NSF and sec18, respectively(2Ordway R.W. Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5715-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).To compare the temporal expression patterns of the dNSF-1 and dNSF-2 genes, probes derived from each of these genes were used to carry out Northern analysis of mRNA from Drosophila adults, larvae, and embryos (Fig. 2). A single dNSF-1 transcript of approximately 3.2 kb was found to be abundant in adult mRNA but detected at substantially lower levels in larvae and embryos. Expression of dNSF-2 was assessed using the same blot and was found to differ from that of dNSF-1 in two ways. First, multiple transcripts are derived from the dNSF-2 gene, ranging in size from 2.4 to 3.4 kb. Most prominent in this group are bands of 2.4, 2.8, 3.0, and 3.4 kb. Second, dNSF-2 differs from dNSF-1 in that it is expressed at similar levels in adults and larvae, with little or no expression detected in embryos.Our previous work has shown that mutations in the dNSF-1 gene are responsible for the comatose temperature-sensitive paralytic phenotype(3Pallanck L. Ordway R.W. Ganetzky B. Nature. 1995; 376: 25Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which includes an apparent failure of synaptic transmission at an elevated temperature(4Siddiqi O. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3253-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These results, along with functional studies of NSF in other systems, imply a role for dNSF-1 in the regulated exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. The results presented here demonstrate that a second Drosophila NSF, dNSF-2, exhibits 84% amino acid identity with dNSF-1 and that the dNSF-2 gene gives rise to multiple transcripts. Thus at least two Drosophila NSF proteins are derived from these dNSF genes, and future work will assess whether the heterogeneity of dNSF-2 transcripts produces multiple dNSF-2 protein isoforms or serves other functions. We also report here that the temporal expression of dNSF-2 partially overlaps with that of dNSF-1. The abundant expression of both dNSF genes in the adult suggests that both may play important functional roles at this stage. It will be of great interest to determine whether these putative roles are executed in the same or different cell types. It is also of interest to note that the dNSF-1 gene is expressed at much higher levels in adults than in larvae, whereas similar levels of dNSF-2 transcript are detected at these two developmental stages. Furthermore, a low level of dNSF-1 transcript but little or no expression of dNSF-2 is detected in embryos, and the possible existence of additional dNSF genes is now being investigated. The developmental regulation of dNSF gene expression raises the possibility that different NSF functional requirements arise during development and are served by specific NSF gene products. Thus while other studies have suggested that a single NSF protein might serve a universal role in the fusion of intracellular vesicles with target membranes(1Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar), this study suggests more complexity in NSF function. The presence of closely related NSF homologs in Drosophila also raises the possibility that similar complexity exists in vertebrates, a possibility that may explain the apparent existence of multiple secretory mechanisms in some cells (for example, see (7Ikonen E. Tagaya M. Ullrich O. Montecucco C. Simmons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 571-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar)).

https://openalex.org/W1994261057,"Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a member of the C-type lectin superfamily with four distinct structural domains: an amino terminus involved in forming intermolecular disulfides, a collagen-like domain, a neck region, and a carbohydrate recognition domain. A collagen domain deletion mutant (CDM) of SP-D was created by site-directed mutagenesis. A second variant lacking both the amino-terminal region and the collagen-like domain was generated by collagenase treatment and purification of the collagenase-resistant fragment (CRF). The CDM expressed in CHO-K1 cells formed the covalent trimers, but not the noncovalent dodecamers, typical of native SP-D. The CRF derived from recombinant SP-D formed only monomers. The CDM bound mannose-Sepharose and phosphatidylinositol (PI) as well as SP-D, but the binding to mannosyl bovine serum albumin and glucosylceramide was diminished by approximately 60%. The CRF displayed weak binding to mannose-Sepharose and PI and essentially no binding to mannosyl bovine serum albumin and glucosylceramide. Both SP-D and CDM altered the self-aggregation of PI-containing liposomes. SP-D reduced the density and the light scattering properties of PI aggregates.These results demonstrate that the collagen-like domain is required for dodecamer but not covalent trimer formation of SP-D and plays an important, but not essential, role in the interaction of SP-D with PI and GlcCer.

The protein can also be produced by non-pulmonary cells (4Fisher J.H. Mason R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). SP-D is a member of the collectin subgroup of the C-type lectin superfamily(5Shimizu H. Fisher J.H. Papst P. Benson B. Lau K. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1853-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its structure is characterized by four distinct domains comprised of: 1) an intermolecular disulfide containing amino-terminal region, 2) a collagen-like domain, 3) a neck region, and 4) a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD)(6Kuroki Y. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25943-25946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopy reveals that the protein exists as a dodecamer which is assembled into a cruciform structure composed of four identical trimers(5Shimizu H. Fisher J.H. Papst P. Benson B. Lau K.

In addition to cruciform-shaped oligomers, large radial aggregates composed of 10 or more trimeric subunits have also been reported. The basic cruciform structure shares similarity with bovine conglutinin and CL-43(5Shimizu H. Fisher J.H. Papst P. Benson B. Lau K. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

Commun. 1992; 187: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and previous studies revealed that the lipid binding properties map to the carbohydrate recognition domain (13Ogasawara Y.

The interaction of SP-D and other collectins with microorganisms may constitute an important component of immunoglobulin-independent host defense. In contrast to the CRD, the role of other SP-D domains in measurable protein function is largely uncharacterized. The role of the collagenous region of surfactant protein A (SP-A), another hydrophilic surfactant-associated glycoprotein that is structurally related to SP-D, has been studied using collagenase-resistant protein fragments (denoted CRF)(18Murata Y. Kuroki Y. Akino T. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Ross G.F. Notter R.H. Meuth J. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14283-14291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies revealed that the collagenous domain is not essential for lipid binding(19Ross G.F. Notter R.H. Meuth J. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14283-14291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of lipid secretion from alveolar type II cells (18Murata Y. Kuroki Y. Akino T. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and binding to the high affinity receptor on type II cells(18Murata Y. Kuroki Y. Akino T. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although the SP-A CRF retained several activities of its intact counterpart, its affinity for different ligands was reduced compared with its native form(18Murata Y. Kuroki Y. Akino T. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Ross G.F. Notter R.H. Meuth J. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14283-14291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extrapolating from these observations, it is probable that the domains other than the CRD of SP-D can contribute to its interactions toward multiple ligands. The purpose of this study was to 1) construct and purify SP-D lacking the collagen domain (collagen deletion mutants (CDM)), 2) prepare and purify SP-D lacking the collagen domain and the amino terminus (CRF), 3) characterize some of the physical properties of the SP-D variants, and 4) determine the effects of the structural interactions upon lipid binding. The results demonstrate that the collagen-like region is required for dodecamer formation but not for trimer formation. In addition, the CDM variant retains 75% of phosphatidylinositol binding and 35% of GlcCer binding, whereas the CRF retains about 35% of the phosphatidylinositol binding but loses GlcCer binding. The 1.2-kb cDNA for rat SP-D (5Shimizu H. Fisher J.H. Papst P. Benson B. Lau K. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1853-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was isolated and ligated into a pEE14 plasmid vector using XbaI and HindIII sites as described previously(5Shimizu H.

A mutant cDNA of SP-D with a deletion at nucleotides corresponding to the region Leu27 to Pro202 (CDM) was produced using the polymerase chain reaction and the overlapping extension method(20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6821) Google Scholar). This construct was also ligated into pEE14 vector using XbaI and HindIII sites. Defined mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entire cDNA using Sequenase and the method of Sanger et al.(21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52597) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were expressed using the glutamine synthetase amplification system as described previously(14Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14725-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pEE14 plasmid vectors containing the cDNAs for wild type SP-D and CDM were transfected into CHO-K1 cells using lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were incubated in glutamine-free GMEM (22Ausbel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman L.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Albright L.M. Coen D.M. Varki A. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1992: 16.14.7-16.14.13Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (complete GMEM-10) in the presence of 25 μM methionine sulfoxamine for 7-10 days at 37°C in a humidified air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. The surviving colonies were transferred to medium containing a higher concentration of methionine sulfoxamine (100-500 μM) and incubated for another 2 weeks. The clones which produced the highest amount of recombinant proteins were selected after screening by SP-D enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To isolate recombinant proteins, the confluent cells incubated in complete GMEM-10 were transferred to serum-free medium. Forty-eight hours later, the medium was harvested and dialyzed against TBS at 4°C. The dialyzed medium was then applied to a mannose-Sepharose affinity matrix (23Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) in the presence of 5 mM calcium, and the recombinant proteins were eluted using 2 mM EDTA. The eluted proteins were dialyzed against TBS again and stored at −20°C. The recombinant proteins were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine using Tran35S-label (ICN) as described previously(14Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14725-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The labeled proteins were isolated and stored at −20°C. The specific activity of 35S-rSP-D and -CDM used ranged between 1500 and 4500 cpm/ng and 400 and 600 cpm/ng, respectively. Wild type recombinant SP-D and 35S-labeled recombinant SP-D were incubated with collagenase (5 units/μg of protein) (Advanced Biofactures Corp.) in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.2, containing 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 37°C for 48 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 mM EDTA. The CRFs were isolated by high performance liquid chromatography using a C8 column and an acetonitrile gradient (20-80% in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The purified CRF was subjected to Edman degradation, and a partial sequence of CRF was determined using a model 492 automated amino acid sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). The specific activity of 35S-CRF used was 800 cpm/ng. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), PI, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine (PS), and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Glucosylceramide (GlcCer) was purchased from Sigma. Multilamellar and unilamellar liposomes were prepared as described previously (13Ogasawara Y. McCormack F.X. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29785-29792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14725-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and used for the lipid binding and self-association assay described below. Recombinant 35S-labeled proteins (0.1 μg) were incubated with 25 μl of a mannose-Sepharose or galactose-Sepharose affinity matrix in 500 μl of TBS (5 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 5 mM CaCl2 and 0.2% BSA (binding buffer) for 1 h at 4°C. The Sepharose matrices were centrifuged at 5000 × gav for 5 min, and the resultant pellet was washed with ice-cold binding buffer. This step was repeated three times, and the radioactivity in the precipitated Sepharose matrix was counted and expressed as percent sedimentation (radioactivity in pellet/radioactivity of total). We determined that Ca2+-dependent binding of rSP-D, CDM, and CRF to underivatized Sepharose was 4.2, 3.8, and 0.3% of the respective proteins (n = 2). In the absence of Ca2+ the binding of all proteins was never higher than 0.1% (n = 2). The binding of 35S-labeled proteins to solid phase carbohydrate was performed using microtiter plates. Mannosylated BSA (E-Y Laboratories) was adsorbed to microtiter wells by incubating the protein (100 μg/ml) in TBS buffer overnight. After removing unadsorbed protein the wells were blocked with 5 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 2% BSA, pH 7.4 (blocking buffer), for 1 h. Next, the 35S-labeled variants of SP-D in the blocking buffer were added to the wells (0-5 μg/ml, 40 μl/well) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed five times with ice-cold blocking buffer, and the radioactivity in each well was quantified using liquid scintillation spectrometry. None of the recombinant proteins bound to underivatized solid phase BSA under any conditions (n = 2). In the absence of Ca2+ the binding of the recombinant proteins never exceeded 0.1% of the added proteins (n = 3). Multilamellar liposomes (100 μg) were incubated with 0.1 μg of 35S-labeled recombinant proteins in TBS containing varying amounts of calcium (as indicated in the figures) and 2% BSA (binding buffer) for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation at 0°C for 10 min. The incubation mixtures were then centrifuged at 10,000 × gav at 4°C for 10 min. The resultant pellet was washed once with ice-cold binding buffer, and the amount of protein sedimented with liposomes was measured using liquid scintillation spectrometry and expressed as percent sedimentation (sedimented radioactivity/total radioactivity added). Binding of 35S-labeled recombinant proteins to solid phase lipids on TLC plates was performed as described previously(10Ogasawara Y. Kuroki Y. Akino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21244-21249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of lipids were developed on the TLC plates with organic solvent, and the plates were air-dried and soaked in the blocking buffer (TBS containing 5 mM CaCl2, 2% BSA, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone) for 1 h. Next, the plates were overlaid with 35S-labeled proteins in blocking buffer for 90 min at room temperature. Finally the plates were washed with ice-cold blocking buffer, air-dried, and exposed to x-ray film at −80°C for 1-5 days. Unilamellar liposomes (100 μg/ml) containing PI and DPPC (50:50, w/w) or PI and DPPC (30:70, w/w) were preincubated with native and recombinant protein (5-20 μg/ml) for 1 min in TBS. Subsequently calcium was added to a final concentration of 5 mM, and the absorbance at 400 nm was measured for 5 min using a Beckman DU-64 spectrophotometer at 20°C. Unilamellar liposomes of PI/DPPC (50:50, w/w) (100 μg/ml), labeled with [3H]DPPC, and 20 μg/ml of rSP-D, CDM, or CRF were incubated in TBS containing 5 mM CaCl2 at 20°C for 5 min. Subsequently, the lipid and protein mixtures were overlaid on 12 ml of TBS containing 5 mM CaCl2 and 40% Percoll. The gradients were formed by centrifugation at 30,000 × gav for 1 h at 20°C. Fractions were collected from the top of the tubes, and the amount of lipid and protein in each fraction was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Rat SP-D was isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of silica-treated rats as described previously(10Ogasawara Y. Kuroki Y. Akino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21244-21249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated by the BCA assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed according to the method of Laemmli(24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206965) Google Scholar). Size fractionations of native and recombinant proteins was performed by gel filtration chromatography using Bio-gel A-1.5m (1.5 × 100-cm column) and Sephacryl S-200 (1.5 × 120 cm) in the presence of 10 mM EDTA at room temperature. SP-D is a member of the C-type lectin superfamily composed of four characteristic domains which are: 1) an NH2-terminal domain involved in interchain disulfide formation, 2) a collagenous domain, 3) a neck domain, and 4) a CRD(6Kuroki Y. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25943-25946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For simplicity, each domain was designated as D1 to D4 as described previously(13Ogasawara Y. McCormack F.X. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29785-29792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, recombinant wild type SP-D is composed of D1 to D4, and CDM is composed of D1, D3, and D4. This mutant contains the deletion Leu27 to Pro202. The CRF obtained from collagenase digestion of rSP-D is composed of D3 and D4, with the amino terminus beginning at Gly200 (the last Gly-X-Y in the collagenous domain) as determined by amino acid sequencing. The CDM of rat SP-D was expressed using the glutamine synthetase system described under “Materials and Methods.” The production of CDM ranged from 1 to 2 mg/48 h/liter culture medium when confluent cells were incubated in 150-mm dishes with 25 ml of medium. The production of CDM was lower than that of wild type recombinant SP-D (3-6 mg/48 h/liter). The results clearly demonstrate that the collagenous region is not required for the secretion of SP-D from CHO-K1 cells. Fig. 2 shows the SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant wild type SP-D (rSP-D), CDM and CRF (lanes a-f). As we reported previously(14Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14725-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), rSP-D appeared at approximately 43 kDa under reducing and denaturing conditions and formed disulfide bonded trimers under nonreducing conditions and appears identical to native rat SP-D. CDM migrated at 22 kDa under reducing conditions, and most of the protein appeared as trimer (61 kDa), although minor amounts of monomer and dimer were detected by autoradiography under nonreducing conditions. CRF obtained after collagenase digestion of rSP-D appeared at 18 kDa under reducing conditions and also appeared as a monomer migrating at 17 kDa under nonreducing conditions. Lanes g-l in Fig. 2 show the autoradiography of 35S-labeled rSP-D, CDM, and CRF. Radiolabeled recombinant proteins were identical to their unlabeled counterparts, and little degradation of the labeled proteins was observed. Fig. 3 shows the results of the size fractionation of the proteins by gel chromatography. The 35S-labeled rSP-D and CDM were analyzed using a Bio-Gel A-1.5m column (Fig. 3A), and the radioactivity of each fraction was quantified using liquid scintillation spectrometry. The 35S-rSP-D eluted mostly at the position of 1200 kDa as reported previously(14Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14725-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, most of the CDM appeared later than aldolase (158 kDa). To evaluate the size of CDM and CRF more accurately, we also performed the chromatography using Sephacryl S-200 (Fig. 3B). Using this latter matrix, the CDM migrated at the position of 67 kDa. The CRF appeared at the position of 18 kDa. These results are consistent with the conclusion that CDM forms a disulfide-bonded trimer, and CRF exists as a monomer in solution.Figure 3:Gel chromatography of recombinant proteins. 35S-rSP-D (○), CDM (•), and CRF (□) were subjected to chromatography using a Bio-Gel A-1.5m column (A) and a Sephacryl S-200 column (B). The radioactivity of each fraction was quantified using liquid scintillation spectrometry. The arrows show the peak position of eluted standards: a, blue dextran; b, thyroglobulin; c, aldolase; d, bovine serum albumin; e, ribonuclease A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Direct binding of 35S-labeled recombinant proteins to mannose-Sepharose or galactose-Sepharose affinity matrices was performed, and the results are shown in Table1. Nearly 100% of rSP-D and CDM bound to the mannose-Sepharose matrix. By comparison, only 20% of CRF bound to the matrix. The binding of CRF to the mannose-Sepharose matrix was not increased when the binding was performed in the presence of up to 20 mM calcium (data not shown). With a galactose-Sepharose matrix, only 20% of rSP-D bound with the matrix, which is identical to the binding of CDM. However, CRF failed to show significant binding to a galactose-Sepharose matrix. Fig. 4 shows the results of direct binding of labeled proteins to solid phase mannosylated BSA. rSP-D and CDM bound to solid phase mannosyl-BSA in a dose-dependent manner, but the binding of CDM at comparable levels of protein was significantly reduced. The CRF did not show any significant binding to mannosyl-BSA. These data suggest that the complete oligomerization of the molecule is an important determinant for the carbohydrate binding activity of SP-D.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Direct binding of 35S-labeled recombinant proteins was performed using multilamellar liposomes containing PI:PS:cholesterol (40:30:40) or GlcCer:PS:cholesterol (40:30:40), and the results are shown in Fig. 5. SP-D and the variants studied do not bind PS:cholesterol liposomes. Approximately 90% of 35S rSP-D bound to PI liposomes as described previously(13Ogasawara Y. McCormack F.X. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29785-29792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14725-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Binding of CDM to PI liposomes (75%) was similar to that of rSP-D, but significantly higher than that of CRF (35%). Binding of the three SP-D proteins to GlcCer liposomes showed greater differences among the three molecules. Only 32% of CDM sedimented with GlcCer liposomes, whereas 80% of the wild type protein sedimented with the glycosphingolipid. No significant binding between CRF and GlcCer liposomes was detected. Fig. 6 shows the direct binding of recombinant proteins to glycolipids on TLC plates, and the results parallel those described in Fig. 5. The rSP-D bound PI most strongly, followed by CDM and CRF. Likewise, rSP-D and CDM showed significant binding to GlcCer; however, CRF again failed to bind to this lipid. These data suggest that the collagenous region is not absolutely required for the glycolipid binding property of SP-D; however, it clearly contributes to the extent of binding found for membrane and solid phase interactions. In addition, although the lipid binding domain of SP-D maps to the CRD, the amino-terminal region containing the intermolecular disulfides appears essential for GlcCer binding.Figure 6:Direct binding of 35S recombinant proteins to lipids on TLC plates. 5 μg of PI and GlcCer were subjected to thin layer chromatography in the solvent system chloroform:methanol:water (70:30:5). After drying the plates and blocking nonspecific binding sites, 35S-rSP-D (lane a), 35S-CDM (lane b), or 35S-CRF (lane c) were incubated with the TLC plates for 90 min. Binding of the radiolabeled proteins was visualized by autoradiography after washing and air drying.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The calcium requirement for binding of the 35S-labeled recombinant proteins to glycolipids was examined using multilamellar liposomes and the results are shown in Fig. 7. As reported previously, rSP-D exhibited maximum binding of PI liposomes at approximately 2.0 mM calcium (Fig. 7A). CDM also showed its maximum binding to PI at 2.0 mM calcium, although the absolute amount of the binding of this protein was lower than that of rSP-D at each concentration of calcium examined. The maximum binding of CRF to PI appeared to occur at approximately 5 mM calcium. Fig. 7B shows the calcium dependence of the binding of the recombinant proteins to GlcCer liposomes. Maximum binding of rSP-D and CDM was observed at approximately 5 mM calcium. CRF failed to demonstrate any significant binding, even at 10 mM calcium. Unilamellar liposomes containing high concentrations of PI aggregate in the presence of Ca and this process can be altered by lipid binding proteins such as SP-D. The self-association of unilamellar liposomes composed of PI and DPPC (50:50 or 30:70) was measured in the presence of the recombinant proteins to determine how structural alterations to SP-D affect lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions. Fig. 8, A-C, shows the effect of rSP-D, CDM, and CRF upon the self-association of PI/DPPC (50:50) unilamellar liposomes. As reported previously(14Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14725-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), rSP-D decreased the maximum A400 of 50% PI-containing liposomes in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 8A). In contrast, CDM increased the maximum A400 effected by calcium (Fig. 8B). The absorbance at 6 min in the presence of 0, 5, and 20 μg/ml of CDM was 0.09, 0.12, and 0.14,"

Two aspartate residues at positions 207 and 215 of the Bacillus subtilis SecA, and Asp-217 in the Escherichia coli SecA, that could be Mg2+ ion ligands, were individually mutated to an asparagine. Mutant SecA proteins were unable to growth-complement an E. coli secA amber mutant strain, and the E. coli SecA mutant interfered with the translocation of precursor proteins in vivo. B. subtilis mutant SecA proteins were expressed to a high level and purified to homogeneity. The high affinity ATP and Mg2+-ion binding activity was reduced in the Asp-207 mutant, and completely lost in the Asp-215 mutant. Both SecA proteins were defective in lipid-stimulated ATPase activity. Proteolytic studies suggest that the two subunits of the mutated dimeric SecA proteins are present in different conformational states. These data suggest that Asp-207 and Asp-215 are involved in the binding of the Mg2+-ion when Mg2+-ATP is bound to SecA, while Asp-207 fulfills an additional catalytic role, possibly in accepting a proton during catalysis. The homodimeric SecA protein is the peripheral subunit of the translocase, and couples the hydrolysis of ATP to the translocation of precursor proteins across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane.

SecA is an essential component of the general protein translocation pathway in Escherichia coli (46Schmidt M.G. Rollo E.E. Grodberg J. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3404-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The homodimeric SecA (2Akita M. Shinkai A. Matsuyama S.-I. Mizushima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

SecA associates with cytosolic precursor proteins bound or unbound to SecB, and guides them to the translocation sites at the cytoplasmic membrane (21Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). At the membrane, SecA interacts with the heterotrimeric SecY/E/G integral membrane protein complex (44Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). SecA is an ATPase, and is stimulated for ATP hydrolysis by its interactions with translocation-competent precursor proteins, the SecY/E/G complex and acidic phospholipids (13Cunningham K. Wickner W.

In the early stages of translocation, SecA uses the energy of ATP binding to insert into the membrane and to release the signal sequence domain of the bound precursor protein (44Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). SecA may undergo nucleotide-modulated cycles of membrane insertion and exclusion (6Breukink E. Demel R.A. De Korte-Kool G. De Kruijff B.

Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) through co-insertion with SecA (18Economou T. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), during which SecA may completely transverse the membrane (23Kim Y.L. Rajapandi T. Oliver D.B. Cell. 1994; 78: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Further translocation may be driven by the protonmotive force and/or repeated nucleotide-modulated SecA cycles (44Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). A detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism of the ATPase activity of SecA will clarify the coupling between the cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis, and the binding and release of the precursor proteins. SecA homologues have been identified in higher plants, primitive algae, and in Gram-negative and -positive bacteria. The Bacillus subtilis SecA protein shares an overall 65% homology with the E. coli SecA (40Overhoff B. Klein M. Spies M. Freudl R. Mol. & Gen.

Chem. 1993; 268: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SecA contains two nucleotide-binding sites, i.e. a high (KD≈ 150 nm) (33Matsuyama S. Kimura E. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 24Klose M. Schimz K.-L. Van der Wolk J. Driessen A.J.M. Freudl R. J. Biol.

The amino terminus of SecA contains the amino acid sequence motif, GXXXXGKT (the Walker motif A) that is characteristic of a major class of nucleotide-binding sites (51Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar). Substitutions at Lys-108 (Lys-106 of the B. subtilis SecA) block the translocation ATPase activity of SecA (24Klose M. Schimz K.-L. Van der Wolk J. Driessen A.J.M. Freudl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Mitchell and Oliver, 1993), and interfere with release of SecA from the membrane (24Klose M. Schimz K.-L. Van der Wolk J. Driessen A.J.M. Freudl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests a coupling between translocation and the temporal insertion/de-insertion of SecA into the membrane (18Economou T. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar; 17Driessen A.J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The Walker B-motif, hXhhD, that in combination with motif A completes the Mg2+-phosphate protein interaction, is found as a tandem repeat at residues 205-217 (residues 203-215 in the B. subtilis SecA) (Fig. 1). The conserved aspartate is thought to be needed for the coordination of the Mg2+ ion. The first occurrence of the B-motif shows some homology to the DEAD box found in helicases (25Koonin E.V. Gorbalenya A.E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 298: 6-8Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), while second occurrence is positioned in a highly conserved region, and aligns with the corresponding domain in members of the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) family (Mitchell and Oliver, 1993). Substitution of Asp-209 of the E. coli SecA is known to block the translocation ATPase activity, confirming its role in catalysis (Mitchell and Oliver, 1993). However, the tandem duplication of this region suggests that the Mg2+-binding domain has a more complicated spatial organization. To determine which of the aspartate residues is needed for Mg2+ binding, we have constructed site-directed mutants at Asp-207 and Asp-215 of the B. subtilis SecA, and at Asp-217 of the E. coli SecA (Fig. 1A). Our data indicate that both aspartate residues are indispensable for SecA function, both in vivo and in vitro. B. subtilis NIG1121 (49Takamatsu H. Fuma S.-I. Nakamura K. Sadaie Y. Shinkai A.

[α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol−1) and [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci mmol−1) were obtained from Amersham, U.K. Isolation of chromosomal DNA, preparation of plasmid DNA, and other DNA techniques followed standard procedures (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The B. subtilis wild-type secA gene was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides OMKL23 (5′-GGCTCTAGAGATGATAGAAGGAGCG) and OMKL24 (5′-TGTGGTACCCATTTCATTCACCTC) as primers and chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis NIG1121 as template. The resulting DNA fragment was digested with XbaI and PstI and cloned into the expression vector pTRC99A (3Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.-J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 69: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) which has been digested with the same restriction enzymes. The corresponding plasmid pMKL400 contained the B. subtilis wild-type secA gene under the control of the lac regulatory elements and its nucleotide sequence (42Sadaie Y. Takamatsu H. Nakamura K. Yamane K. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 98: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid pMKL180, containing the E. coli wild-type secA gene, was described previously (24Klose M. Schimz K.-L. Van der Wolk J. Driessen A.J.M. Freudl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the B. subtilis secA gene was performed essentially according to the method of 26Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar using the Mutagene phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). A 2.6-kilobase BamHI/SphI fragment from pMKL400, containing the B. subtilis secA gene, was cloned into the BamHI/SphI-digested phagemid pTZ18U (34Mead D.A. Szczesna-Skopura E. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid pTZ181 was transformed into E. coli BW313 and uracil-containing single-stranded phagemid DNA was isolated. The oligonucleotides OMKL40 (5′-TGTTCTTGCTTCATTAATTAAAATAG) or OMKL41 (5′-GAGTCAACTTCATTTATTACCGCAAA) were used as mismatch primers for the replacement of Asp-215 or Asp-207 by Asn in the B. subtilis SecA. Using OMKL40 or OMKL41 as primers, the complementary DNA strand was synthesized by T4 polymerase and the resulting double-stranded phagemid DNAs were transformed into JM109. The presence of the desired mutations was screened by DNA sequencing and the resulting plasmids were named pTZ182 (containing the secA D215N allele) and pTZ183 (containing the secA D207N allele). From these plasmids, a 2.6-kilobase XbaI/PstI fragment was subcloned into the XbaI/PstI-digested expression vector pTRC99A, resulting in plasmids pMKL440 (secA D215N) and pMKL441 (secA D207N). Replacement of Asp-217 in the E. coli SecA by Asn was done by two-step PCR as described by 29Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar. A 0.63-kilobase DNA fragment corresponding to the 5′-end of the E. coli secA gene was amplified by PCR using plasmid pMF8 (45Schmidt M.G. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 643-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as template and oligonucleotides OMKL25.1 (5′-ATGAATCTAGAGGCGTTTGAGATTTTAT) as 5′-primer and OMKL70 (5′-GAGTCCACTTCGTTCACCAGCGCA) as mismatch primer. The resulting DNA fragment was isolated and, together with an equimolar amount of OMKL71 (5′-AACGATGTAGTCGACGTCACGGGT), was used in a second PCR as primer, in which pMF8 again was used as template. The DNA fragment, which resulted from this second PCR, was digested with XbaI and SalI and ligated into pMKL180, from which the corresponding XbaI/SalI fragment had been removed. The presence of the desired mutation (E. coli secA D217N) was screened by DNA sequencing and the corresponding plasmid was designated pMKL183. To test for steady-state accumulation of MalE and OmpA precursor proteins, the corresponding cells were grown in the presence of glucose to A600 = 0.6, washed once with L-broth and resuspended in the original volume of L-broth containing 0.4% maltose and 1 mM IPTG. After 1-2 h incubation at 37°C, 1-ml samples were precipitated with 200 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid and kept on ice for 2 h. The samples were pelleted by centrifugation and washed once with 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and acetone. Subsequently, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and Western blotting using MBP, OmpA, or SecA antibodies as described (40Overhoff B. Klein M. Spies M. Freudl R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 228: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). E. coli strain JM109 harboring the plasmids pMKL400, pMKL21, pMKL441, or pMKL440, was used for the isolation of the B. subtilis wild-type, K106N, D207N, and D215N SecA protein, respectively. Plasmid-bearing cells were grown overnight in L-broth containing glucose and ampicillin at 37°C. Cells were diluted 50-fold in fresh L-broth containing ampicillin, and induced for protein expression by the addition of 200 μM IPTG. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after 4 h, and resuspended in an equal weight of 10% (w/v) sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The suspension was frozen as nuggets by rapid pipetting in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. B. subtilis SecA proteins were purified as described (24Klose M. Schimz K.-L. Van der Wolk J. Driessen A.J.M. Freudl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the purification of the D207N and D215N SecA proteins, the phenyl-Sepharose chromatographic step was replaced for a weaker hydrophobic interaction medium, i.e. butyl-Sepharose. It was not possible to elute the mutant SecA proteins to an appreciable yield from the phenyl-Sepharose resin, suggesting that they differ from the wild-type SecA in that they expose a greater hydrophobic surface. Pooled SecA-containing peak fractions from the MonoQ chromatographic step (24Klose M. Schimz K.-L. Van der Wolk J. Driessen A.J.M. Freudl R. J. Biol.

The SecA protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 1.3-0 M ammonium sulfate in Buffer A. Mutant SecA proteins eluted at approximately 80 mM ammonium sulfate shortly after the endogenous E. coli SecA. To remove remaining minor impurities, the material was further purified using again MonoQ and a HiLoad Superdex™174; 200 column (24Klose M. Schimz K.-L. Van der Wolk J. Driessen A.J.M. Freudl R. J.

Purified proteins were analyzed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE and by Western blotting using polyclonal antisera directed against the B. subtilis and E. coli SecA protein. Western blots confirmed that the protein samples were free of residual E. coli SecA. ATPase activity of SecA was assayed as described before (24Klose M. Schimz K.-L. Van der Wolk J. Driessen A.J.M.

Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. SecA (30 pmol) was incubated in Buffer B (50 mM Tris-OAc, pH 7.5, 100 mM KOAc, 2 mM MgOAc, 1 m DTT) with 25 or 100 nM [α-32P]ATP for 15 min at 0°C, and then subjected to photoaffinity cross-linking for 40 min at 0°C using a 254-nm lamp (Model UVG-54, UVP Live Sciences Inc., Cambridge, United Kingdom) at a distance of 2 cm. Cross-linking reactions were carried out with or without UV radiation in the presence or absence of ATP at the indicated concentrations. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels. The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR Film. Autoradiograms were densitometrically scanned using a Dextra DF-2400T scanner and analyzed using SigmaScan/Image (Jandel Corp., San Rafael, CA). SecA conformation was probed by the sensitivity to Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease according to 2Akita M. Shinkai A. Matsuyama S.-I. Mizushima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Binding of Mg2+ ions to SecA was measured with the fluorescent indicator Magnesium Green™174; (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) and by quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Magnesium Green™174; measures the free concentration of Mg2+. Solutions (150 μl) contained: 200 μM MgOAc, 50 mM Tris-OAc, pH 7.5, 100 mM KOAc, 1 mM DTT, and 30 μM Magnesium Green™174;. SecA (300 nM) was added to the solution, and the decrease in fluorescence was followed at 532 nm, using an excitation wavelength of 476 nm and a bandwidth of 4 nm. Binding experiments were carried out in the absence of ATP, as the high Mg2+ ion binding capacity of ATP precluded the detection of specific binding of Mg2+ ions to SecA. For measurements of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, MgOAc was added at various concentrations ranging from 500 μM to 50 mM to a solution of 600 μl containing: 0.8-1 μM SecA, 50 mM Tris-OAc, pH 7.5, and 100 mM KOAc. Tryptophan fluorescence emission measurements were referenced against the excitation intensity. Excitation and emission was at 290 and 330 nm, respectively. Bandwidths were set at 2 nm. Quenching data was analyzed according to the modified Stern-Volmer equation (28Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1986Google Scholar): FoFo−F=FoΔF=1fo⋅K⋅[Q]+1fo(Eq. 1) were Fo and F are the tryptophan fluorescence in the absence and presence of Mg2+, respectively. fa is the fraction of the fluorescence signal accessible to the quencher Mg2+, K is the Stern-Volmer constant in mM−1, and [Q], is the Mg2+ concentration in mM. All fluorescence measurements were performed at 20°C using an SLM 4800C time-resolved fluorometer (Aminco, Urbana, IL). Assays of translocation of 35S-proOmpA into inverted inner membrane vesicles of E. coli strain D10 were performed as described (31Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Reactions mixtures (50 μl) contained Buffer C (50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin, 2 mM DTT), 5 μg ml−1E. coli SecA, 10 μg ml−1 SecB, 2 mM ATP, 10 mM phosphocreatine, 50 μg ml−1 creatine kinase, and inverted inner membrane vesicles (44 μg of protein ml−1). When indicated, reaction mixtures were supplemented with 50 μg ml−1B. subtilis wild-type or mutant SecA. Translocation was initiated by the addition of 1 μl of 35S-proOmpA in 6 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. After 30 min incubation at 37°C, samples were treated with proteinase K (0.2 mg ml−1, 30 min, 0°C), and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Protein concentrations were determined as described (5Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal sequencing of proteolytic fragments of SecA was performed by Eurosequence, Groningen, The Netherlands. The high affinity nucleotide binding site of SecA is located in the amino-terminal region (33Matsuyama S. Kimura E. Mizushima S. J. Biol.

Residues 203-207 in the B. subtilis SecA (and residues 205-209 in the E. coli SecA) (Fig. 1A) show sequence similarity to the Walker B-motif, hXhhD (51Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar) of a typical nucleotide binding fold. The motif seems to occur as a repeat (Fig. 1B), with Asp-207 and Asp-215 (Asp-209 and Asp-217 in the E. coli SecA) as possible candidates for the conserved aspartate that coordinates the Mg2+ ion of the bound Mg2+-ATP complex. To reveal their function in catalysis and Mg2+-binding, Asp-207 and Asp-215 of the B. subtilis SecA were individually mutated to the cognate amide residue, asparagine (pMKL441, D207N; and pMKL440, D215N; respectively). A complementary mutation was introduced in the E. coli SecA, i.e. D217N (corresponding to Asp-215 in the B. subtilis SecA; pMKL183). A previous study on E. coli SecA (Mitchell and Oliver, 1993) has shown that the D209N (i.e. Asp-207 in the B. subtilis SecA) mutation blocks the translocation ATPase activity. Mutated secA genes were placed under the control of the lac regulatory elements in the expression vector pTRC99A, and plasmids were transformed into E. coli JM109. Expression was monitored under repressed (0.5% glucose) or fully induced (1 mM IPTG) conditions. The B. subtilis or E. coli SecA mutant proteins were expressed to levels found for the respective wild-type proteins (data not shown). pMKL400 (encoding B. subtilis SecA wild-type protein), pMKL440 (B. subtilis SecA(D215N)), pMKL441 (B. subtilis SecA(D207N)), pMKL180 (E. coli SecA wild-type), and pMKL183 (E. coli SecA(D217N)) were introduced into the conditional-lethal E. coli secA mutants MM52 (secA51ts) (38Oliver D.B.

Compared to pMKL400 and pMKL180, the transformation efficiency of pMKL440, pMKL441, and pMKL183 in these strains was significantly lower but could be improved by including, in addition to 0.5% glucose, the anti-inducer ortho-nitrophenylgalactofucoside (1 mM) throughout the whole transformation procedure.

https://openalex.org/W1492528868,"During studies on the regulation of rat ovarian steroidogenic enzymes by interleukin-1β (IL-1β), we observed substantial metabolism of 25-hydroxycholesterol to two unusual polar products. This unexpected effect was observed both in isolated granulosa cells and in whole ovarian dispersates and was also induced by tumor necrosis factor α, but not by insulin-like growth factor I or follicle-stimulating hormone. The effect was dependent on time and the dose of IL-1β and was blocked by an IL-1 receptor antagonist. The formation of the polar metabolites was inhibited by ketoconazole and trilostane, but not by aminoglutethimide. Subsequent purification of these novel metabolites and analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, NMR, and high performance liquid chromatography revealed them to be related 7α-hydroxylated hydroxycholesterols (cholest-4-ene-7α,25-diol-3-one and cholest-5-ene-3β,7α,25-triol). IL-1β-stimulated ovarian 7α-hydroxylase activity (3-10 pmol/min/mg of cellular protein) was nearly 4-fold that of control levels using 25-hydroxycholesterol as substrate. Activities at or below control levels were observed when IL-1β-treated cell sonicates were boiled or assayed in the presence of NADH (rather than NADPH), indicating that involvement of a nonenzymatic process was unlikely. IL-1β-stimulated 7α-hydroxylase activity was inhibited to basal levels by a 10-fold excess of unlabeled 25- or 27-hydroxycholesterol, but not by cholesterol, pregnenolone, progesterone, testosterone, or dehydroepiandrosterone, suggesting that ovarian 7α-hydroxylase is specific for hydroxycholesterols. Furthermore, when IL-1β-treated ovarian cultures were incubated with radiolabeled cholesterol or testosterone, no 7α-hydroxylated products were observed. We were also unable to detect any mRNA transcripts for liver cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase in IL-1β-stimulated ovarian cultures. This study describes an ovarian hydroxycholesterol 7α-hydroxylase that differs from liver cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase and from other nonhepatic progestin/androgen 7α-hydroxylases. The novel finding of the regulation of a 7α-hydroxylase by IL-1β (and tumor necrosis factor α) suggests a unique role for cytokines in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in the ovary and possibly other tissues.

The novel finding of the regulation of a 7α-hydroxylase by IL-1β (and tumor necrosis factor α) suggests a unique role for cytokines in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in the ovary and possibly other tissues. The 7α-hydroxylation of steroids has potentially widespread biological significance. At least three categories of steroid 7α-hydroxylases may be defined. By far the best understood is cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (cholesterol 7α-monooxygenase, EC 1.14.13.17), a putative liver-specific (1Jelinek D.F. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8190-8197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) microsomal enzyme (2Straka M.S. Junker L.H. Zaccarro L. Zogg D.L. Dueland S. Everson G.T. Davis R.A. J. Biol.

Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. Hepatology. 1991; 13: 590-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As such, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase plays a critical dual role as the primary enzyme promoting both cholesterol catabolism and bile acid formation. A second category of 7α-hydroxylases includes several recently described nonhepatic enzymes that act on side chain-cleaved steroids. A dehydroepiandrosterone/pregnenolone 7α-hydroxylase has been reported in brain and other tissues (4Akwa Y. Morfin R.F. Robel P. Baulieu E.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 5Morfin R. Courchay G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 50: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and in adipose stromal cells(6Khalil M.W. Strutt B. Vachon D. Killinger D.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Biol. 1994; 48: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and a testosterone 7α-hydroxylase in testis, lung, and kidney(8Inano H. Tamaoki B. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Sonderfan A.J. Arlotto M.P. Parkinson A. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The functional significance of these 7α-hydroxylated steroids in nonhepatic tissues has not yet been established. The metabolites may regulate the availability of their biologically active precursors or could have biological activity themselves. For example, Morfin and Courchay (5Morfin R. Courchay G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 50: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) have suggested that 7α-hydroxylated metabolites of pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone may regulate the immune response in mice. The existence of a third class of steroid 7α-hydroxylases that preferentially metabolize hydroxycholesterols is controversial. It is well established that the liver is able to use hydroxycholesterols as well as cholesterol as substrates for bile acid biosynthesis(3Vlahcevic Z.R. Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. Hepatology. 1991; 13: 590-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Swell L. Schwartz C.C. Gustafsson J. Danielsson H. Vlahcevic Z.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Recently, it has been suggested that this activity involves a hepatic hydroxycholesterol 7α-hydroxylase that is different from cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase(12Axelson M. Shoda J. Sjovall J. Toll A.

Oxysterols such as 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterols (as distinct from cholesterol itself) act via a putative receptor (cf.(15Srinivasan G. Patel N.T. Thompson E.B.

Oxysterols also affect cell growth and viability presumably via their inhibitory effects on cholesterol availability(19Bakos J.T. Johnson B.H. Thompson E.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Given the regulatory importance of hydroxysterols, their further metabolism to 7α-hydroxylated products is of considerable interest.

Similarly, herein, 27-hydroxysterol designates both 27-hydroxysterol and 26-hydroxysterol. mRNA is widely distributed(25Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol.

Cell cultures were maintained for 72 h at 37°C under a water-saturated atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. At the conclusion of the incubation period, the media (and/or cells) were collected prior to further processing as described below. Since cholesterol and hydroxycholesterols are relatively insoluble in aqueous solution, these compounds (and the other steroids used) were solubilized using 2-HPBCD, an agent that provides stable effective solubilization of steroids (39De Caprio J. Yun J. Javitt N.B. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 441-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stock solutions (5 mM) were prepared in 45% (w/v) 2-HPBCD(39De Caprio J. Yun J. Javitt N.B. J.

In some earlier studies, 25-hydroxycholesterol was dissolved in a 100% methanol stock and diluted into tissue culture medium containing 0.05% (w/v) 2-HPBCD. This method of solubilization gave identical results for studies using 25-hydroxycholesterol as a substrate, but was ineffective when cholesterol was the substrate. Following the 72-h preincubation and treatment period, cell culture media were discarded, and the cells were washed with fresh media (1 ml). Thereafter, fresh media (1 ml, 0.03-0.05% 2-HPBCD) containing 10,000-30,000 cpm 25-[3H]hydroxycholesterol, [3H]cholesterol, or other labeled substrates (0.2-10 μM, as noted) were added along with the same treatment protocol used during the 72-h preincubation period. After an additional 24 h, media were collected and subjected to HPLC as described below. Initial cellular radiolabeling studies on the polar metabolites of 25-hydroxycholesterol used 25-[16,17-3H]hydroxycholesterol as substrate. Later, we determined that both 25-[16,17-3H]hydroxycholesterol and 25-[26,27-3H]hydroxycholesterol gave similar results (quantitatively and qualitatively) when used as substrates to examine 7α-hydroxylase activity. Subsequently, the latter compound was used whenever possible since supplies of the commercially unavailable 25-[16,17-3H]hydroxycholesterol were limited. However, if cholesterol side chain cleavage activity is present (e.g. when cells are stimulated by gonadotropin), only 25-[16,17-3H]hydroxycholesterol can be used as substrate since the labeled side chain is cleaved from 25-[26,27-3H]hydroxycholesterol. Following a 72-h incubation and treatment period, cell cultures were centrifuged at low speed for 2 min, and the media supernatants were removed. The cells were then washed (with centrifugation) by the addition of 1 ml of assay buffer, after which the supernatant was removed, and 0.4 ml of assay buffer was added. Cells were then sonicated (5 s, setting 5) using the microtip of a cell sonicator (Vibracell, Sonics & Materials, Inc., Danbury, CT). 7α-Hydroxylase activity was determined in the freshly prepared cell sonicates by the conversion of 25-[3H]hydroxycholesterol to [3H]cholest-5-ene-3β,7α,25-triol (7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol, X2). Assay conditions did not permit oxidation of the substrate 3β-hydroxy group to form cholest-4-ene-7α,25-diol-3-one (7α,25-dihydroxycholestenone, X1). The assay was performed as follows. A sufficient quantity of 25-[3H]hydroxycholesterol for an entire assay was evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in an appropriate quantity of unlabeled 25-hydroxycholesterol dissolved in 0.4% 2-HPBCD. 20 μl of this substrate preparation (final assay concentration of 20,000-30,000 cpm, 0.2 μM substrate; 0.01-0.03% 2-HPBCD) was placed in each tube. (For competition studies, 10 μl of unlabeled substrate dissolved in 1.8% 2-HPBCD was also added.) Additionally, each assay tube (final volume of 1 ml) contained pH 7.4 assay buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.25 M sucrose) and cell sonicate from 1 × 106 cells. NADPH (final concentration of 0.5 mM) was added to start the reaction, which proceeded at 37°C for 3 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 N NaOH (100 μl). Substrate and product were separated and quantified by HPLC as described below. Enzyme activity is expressed as picomoles of product (7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol, X2) formed per hour/1 × 106 cells. Steroids present in tissue culture media or enzyme assay incubates were extracted twice in a 3-fold volume of ethyl acetate and evaporated to dryness. The residual steroids were redissolved in solvent and separated by HPLC, as described previously (40Payne D.W. Holtzclaw W.D. Adashi E.Y. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 39: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), on a 10-μm LiChrosorb Diol column (EM Reagents, Gibbstown, NJ) with the use of a Waters HPLC system. Radioactivity was detected on line by a Flo-One/Beta detector (Packard Instruments), and absorbance at 240 nm was simultaneously monitored by a flow-through spectrophotometer (Lambda-Max, Waters). The column was calibrated with more than 35 steroids(40Payne D.W. Holtzclaw W.D. Adashi E.Y. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 39: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), including most of those expected to be found in the ovary. The column tends to separate steroids based on the number of their hydroxyl groups, with less polar steroids eluting first. Whole ovarian dispersates were plated (1.5 × 106 cells/3 ml) in 60 × 50-mm culture dishes and incubated for 72 h in the presence of IL-1β (50 ng/ml). Media were then removed, and fresh media (3 ml) containing IL-1β (50 ng/ml), 25-hydroxycholesterol (10 μM), and 2-HPBCD (0.05%) were added. After 24 h, media steroids were extracted, pooled, and subjected to HPLC. Parallel cultures containing radiolabeled substrate were processed identically to monitor completion of the reaction and to delineate elution times of the metabolites. The effluent volumes containing the unknown metabolite peaks were collected and subjected to GC/MS or NMR as described below. Under these conditions, ∼1 μg each of X1 and X2 could be obtained per 1.5 × 106 cells. ∼1-2 or 100-200 μg of steroid was required for identification by GC/MS or NMR, respectively. Steroids were derivatized to form trimethylsilyl and methyloxime-trimethylsilyl derivatives according to previously published methods(41Shackleton C.H.L. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 379: 91-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). When excess reagents had been removed, the final solution was in cyclohexane (the solvent used for injection into the GC/MS instrument). GC/MS was carried out on a Hewlett-Packard MSD 5970 instrument, housing a 15-m DB1 nonpolar capillary column (J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA). The samples were introduced by syringe injection with cold trapping at 60°C. After 3 min, the temperature was rapidly increased to the 220°C starting temperature of the program. Thereafter, the temperature was increased linearly by 3°C/min to the final temperature of 330°C. Mass spectra were obtained by continuous repetitive scanning over the 100-700 mass range. For both purified X1 and X2, the entire sample was dissolved in 0.5 ml of CDCl3 (99.96% D; Goss Scientific Instruments Ltd., Ingatestone, Essex, United Kingdom). The solution was filtered using a small square of tissue over the tip of the pipette used to transfer the solution to the NMR tube (Wilmad 535). Spectra were run on a Bruker AMX2-600 spectrometer (University of London Intercollegiate Research Service at Queen Mary and Westfield College, London). Chemical shifts were measured with reference to residual CHCl3 (7.26 ppm) at a temperature of 303 K. In addition to the 1H spectrum, a double quantum filtered COSY spectrum (42Piantini U. Sorensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Crossref Scopus (1868) Google Scholar) and an ω1-decoupled COSY (43Bax A. Freeman R.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; : 542-561Google Scholar) were run to assist with identification and spectral assignment. Signal templates (44Kirk D.N. Toms H.C. Douglas C. White K.A. Smith K.E. Latif S. Hubbard R.W.P. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1990; 2: 1567-1594Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar) were used to identify as many signals as possible in the 1H spectrum. Two-dimensional methods (double quantum filtered COSY and ω1-decoupled COSY) were then used to find the position of coupled signals that overlap in the one-dimensional spectrum. In this way, it was possible to unambiguously assign all of the ring protons and most of the side chain protons (cholestane side chain proton signals have yet to be fully determined; cf.(44Kirk D.N. Toms H.C. Douglas C. White K.A. Smith K.E. Latif S. Hubbard R.W.P. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1990; 2: 1567-1594Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar)). The rat cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase cDNA (1Jelinek D.F. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8190-8197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. David W. Russell (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). For the RNase protection assays, the plasmid containing the cDNA insert was linearized with AseI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP to yield a 409-nucleotide riboprobe, which, upon hybridization, was projected to generate a 346-nucleotide protected fragment. For an internal standard to ensure comparable RNA loadings, a probe for constitutively expressed rat ribosomal protein L19 (RPL19) (45Chan Y.-L. Lin A. McNally J. Peleg D. Meyuhas O. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1111-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was generated by reverse transcription of 1 μg of RNA followed by amplification via the polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction product was then cloned into the pCR1000 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), verified by DNA sequencing, digested with FokI, and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase to generate a 214-nucleotide probe capable of protecting a 153-nucleotide segment. After transcription, the riboprobes were gel-purified. The size differences of the protected fragments generated from the riboprobes for 7α-hydroxylase and RPL19 allow the simultaneous detection of these transcripts on the same gel. RNA of cultured cells or tissue was extracted with RNazol-B (Tel Test, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Liquid hybridization/RNase protection assays were carried out as described previously(46Hurwitz A Loukides J. Ricciarelli E. Botero L. Katz E. McAllister J.M. Garcia J.E. Rohan R. Adashi E.Y. Hernandez E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1746-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of replicate experiments (n noted in legends), each performed in duplicate. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) by ANOVA analysis (Fisher's protected least significant difference) or by two-tailed unpaired t test (for -fold changes) was calculated using Statview 512+ for MacIntosh (Brain Power, Inc., Calabasas, CA). During studies on the IL-1β-mediated regulation of cytochrome P450CSCC in cultures of isolated rat granulosa cells, we observed that the addition of IL-1β to the cultures promoted a remarkable metabolism of the 25-hydroxycholesterol substrate to a major and a minor polar metabolite. As shown in Fig. 1, granulosa cells were initially cultured for 72 h in the absence or presence of IL-1β (50 ng/ml), with and without a dose of FSH that maximally stimulates cytochrome P450CSCC activity (2 milliunits/ml). Thereafter, cells were washed and incubated with 25-[3H]hydroxycholesterol (0.2 μM) for an additional 24 h. FSH-pretreated cells metabolized the substrate to the cytochrome P450CSCC products, pregnenolone, progesterone, and 20α-dihydroprogesterone, as expected. However, the addition of IL-1β induced the nearly complete loss of substrate, coincident with the appearance of a major (X1) and a minor (X2) metabolite at 15.7 and 20.4 min, respectively, as detected by HPLC. This result was highly reproducible. IL-1β promoted a 4.1 ± 0.5-fold increase (p < 0.005) in X1 plus X2 above control levels (n = six separate experiments). The effect was dependent on the dose of IL-1β (Fig. 1, inset), with a maximum production of X1 and X2 occurring at 25-50 ng/ml IL-1β. We have previously described a similar dose range for other IL-1β actions in the ovary(29Hurwitz A. Hernandez E.R. Andreani C.L. Resnick C.E. Packman J.N."
https://openalex.org/W2012453016,"The kinetics of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced Ca2+ release of the immunoaffinity-purified IP3 receptor (IP3R), reconstituted into lipid vesicles, was investigated using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fluo-3. IP3R was purified from mouse cerebellar microsomal fraction by using an immunoaffinity column conjugated with an anti-IP3R type 1 (IP3R1) antibody. The immunoblotting analysis using monoclonal antibodies against each IP3R type showed that the purified IP3R is almost homogeneous, composed of IP3R1. Ca2+ efflux from the proteoliposomes was monitored as fluorescence changes of 10 μM fluo-3, whose concentration was high enough to buffer released Ca2+ and to keep deviations of extravesicular free Ca2+ concentration within 30 nM, excluding the possibility of Ca2+-mediated regulation of IP3-induced Ca2+ release. We also examined IP3-induced Ca2+ release using 1 μM fluo-3, where the deviations of free Ca2+ concentration were within 300 nM. At both fluo-3 concentrations, IP3-induced Ca2+ release showed similar kinetic properties, i.e. little Ca2+ regulation of Ca2+ release was observed in this system. IP3-induced Ca2+ release of the purified IP3R exhibited positive cooperativity; the Hill coefficient was 1.8 ± 0.1. The half-maximal initial rate for Ca2+ release occurred at 100 nM IP3. At the submaximal concentrations of IP3, the purified IP3R showed quantal Ca2+ release, indicating that a single type of IP3R is capable of producing the phenomenon of quantal Ca2+ release. The profiles of the IP3-induced Ca2+ release of the purified IP3R were found to be biexponential with the fast and slow rate constants (kfast = 0.3 ∼ 0.7 s−1, kslow = 0.03 ∼ 0.07 s−1), indicating that IP3R has two states to release Ca2+. The amount of released Ca2+ by the slow phase was constant over the range of 10-5000 nM IP3 concentrations, whereas that by the fast phase increased in proportion to added IP3. This provides evidence to support the view that the fast phase of Ca2+ release is mediated by the low affinity state and the slow phase by the high affinity state of the IP3R. This also suggests that the fast component of Ca2+ release is responsible for the process of quantal Ca2+ release.

Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6166) Google Scholar). The IP3 signal is converted into a Ca2+ signal by binding to its specific receptor, i.e. the IP3 receptor (IP3R), which is an IP3-induced Ca2+-releasing channel located on intracellular Ca2+ stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum. This IP3-mediated Ca2+ signaling plays a critical role in a variety of cell functions, including fertilization, cell proliferation, metabolism, secretion, contraction of smooth muscle, and neural signals(1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6166) Google Scholar). For these multiple cell signaling, the mechanisms of transducing the IP3 signal into a Ca2+ signal, i.e. IP3-induced Ca2+ release (IICR), may be diverse in each cell type.

Chem. 1989; 264: 205-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where submaximal concentrations of IP3 cause the partial release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. There are often discrepancies in the properties of channel opening and the effects of modulators on IICR among the reports, because, in these studies, the arguments on some critical points of IICR have often been complicated due to the different experimental systems used, i.e. different micro-environments surrounding the IP3R and Ca2+ pools assayed (e.g. different constitution of phospholipase C, IP3-metabolizing enzymes, Ca2+-binding proteins, Ca2+ pumps, and modulators in each cell type). For example, the degree of the cooperativity of Ca2+ release, which is an important issue for understanding the channel opening mechanism, differed among the reports. Some reports show no cooperativity of IICR(4Finch E.A. Turner T.J. Goldin S.M. Science. 1991; 252: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 15Watras J. Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. J.

In addition, recent molecular cloning studies have revealed that there are at least three types of the IP3R from distinct genes(22Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 23Sudhof T.C. Newton C.L. Archer III, B.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Mignery G.A.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11356-11363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the major arguments on IICR derives from the fact that multiple IP3R types can coexist within a single cell type(25Sugiyama T. Yamamoto-Hino M. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Hasegawa M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Sugiyama T. Furuya A. Monkawa T. Yamamoto-Hino M. Satoh S. Ohmori K. Miyawaki A. Hanai N. Mikoshiba K. Hasegawa M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To further characterize the channel opening mechanism, the kinetic study of IICR should be examined using a purified single type of the IP3R. The cerebellum is known to be the richest source of IP3R type 1 (IP3R1) among rodent tissues tested. A recent immunohistochemical study indicated that rat cerebellum contains three IP3R types whose expressing cell types are quite distinct; IP3R1 is well known to be enriched in Purkinje cells, IP3R type 3 (IP3R3) is present in Bergmann glia and astrocytes, and IP3R type 2 (IP3R2) is also present, but not in neurons and astrocytes(27Yamamoto-Hino M. Miyawaki A. Kawano H. Sugiyama T. Furuichi T. Hasegawa M. Mikoshiba K. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The differential localization of each IP3R type in cerebellar cell types indicates that most IP3R•channel complexes in the cerebellum are homotetramers within single cells. In the present study, we have purified the cerebellar IP3R using an immunoaffinity column coupled with an anti-IP3R1 antibody as described previously(9Nakade S. Rhee S.K. Hamanaka H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6735-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The population of the purified IP3R has been found to be almost homogeneous, containing little IP3R2 and IP3R3. Therefore the results derived from the analysis of this purified IP3R reflect the properties of IP3R1. In this study, we have investigated the kinetics of IICR mediated by the purified and reconstituted IP3R using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fluo-3 and have defined the cooperativity, quantal Ca2+ release, and biphasic nature of IICR. The following reagents were purchased: IP3, CHAPS, and fluo-3 from Dojindo Laboratories (Kumamoto, Japan); Chelex 100 from Bio-Rad; diethylenetriamine-N,N,N′,N′,N′-pentaacetic acid-conjugated polymetal sponge from Molecular Probes; phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. All of other reagents were of analytical grade or the highest grade available. Removal of Ca2+ contamination is necessary to measure the calcium release and to improve the sensitivity of the fluorometric measurements. We removed the Ca2+ contamination according to the method of Meyer et al.(3Meyer T. Wensel T. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, all solutions used in fluorometric measurements were passed over a polymetal sponge, and all labwares were successively washed with detergent, 0.1 N HCl, distilled water, and the buffer to be used. Ca2+ contamination in all solutions, cuvettes, and stir bars was checked using the Ca2+ indicator fluo-3 before the measurements. IP3 stock solution was also passed over the polymetal sponge to remove Ca2+. Passing IP3 stock solution over the polymetal sponge did not cause any changes in IP3 concentrations, which was checked using IP33H radio receptor assay kit (DuPont NEN). IP3R was purified from mouse cerebellar microsomal fraction by using an immunoaffinity column conjugated with a polyclonal antibody against IP3R1 by the method reported previously(9Nakade S. Rhee S.K. Hamanaka H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6735-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies, 18A10, KM1083, and KM1082 against IP3R type 1, IP3R type 2, and IP3R type 3, respectively, were prepared as described elsewhere(26Sugiyama T. Furuya A. Monkawa T.

Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol dissolved in chloroform were mixed to give a concentration of 3, 1, and 0.8 mg/ml, respectively. The lipid mixture was dried to a thin film under a stream of nitrogen gas and then under vacuum. The lipid film was suspended at 2 mg/ml in buffer A (100 mM KCl, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), and 4 mM CaCl2) containing 1% CHAPS. The immunoaffinity-purified IP3R was concentrated by using Centriprep 100 (Amicon) to give a protein concentration of 100 μg/ml. The concentrated IP3R solution was mixed with buffer A containing lipids and detergent to give final IP3R, lipids, and CHAPS of 50 μg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, and 1%, respectively. After 20-min incubation on ice with occasional gentle stirring, the IP3R/lipid mixtures were dialyzed for 72 h against eight changes of a 500-fold volume excess of buffer A at 4°C. The resulting proteoliposomes (IP3R in lipid vesicles) were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 2°C, washed with buffer B (buffer A without Ca2++ 10 or 1 μM of fluo-3) twice, and resuspended with buffer B in the same volume used before dialysis. After incubation for 10 min at 25°C, the resuspended proteoliposomes were passed over Chelex 100 to remove Ca2+ and were used for IICR assay. Ca2+ efflux from the proteoliposomes was measured by monitoring the fluorescence changes of fluo-3. Fluorometric measurements of IICR were performed by using an F-2000 fluorometer (Hitachi, Inc.) interfaced to a PC9801-VX computer (NEC, Inc.). The excitation and emission wavelength were 500 and 525 nm, respectively, with 10 nm bandpass. Fluorescence signals were corrected for fluctuations in excitation light intensity. Measurements were made at 25°C in a 0.5 × 0.5-cm quartz cuvette containing 0.4 ml of the proteoliposome solution with continuous stirring by a Teflon stir bar. IICR was monitored after addition of 2 μl of IP3 to give the desired IP3 concentration. The data were acquired every 200 ms. The fluorescent intensities of fluo-3 were calibrated to free Ca2+ concentrations using Ca2+-EGTA buffering system(30Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The calibration curve gave the dissociation constant of fluo-3 for Ca2+ of 170 nM, which was used to estimate the free and total Ca2+ concentrations. To exclude the possibility of Ca2+ regulation of IICR, we used 10 μM fluo-3, whose concentration was high enough to buffer the released Ca2+ and to keep deviations of extravesicular free Ca2+ concentration within 10-30 nM. We also examined IICR using 1 μM fluo-3, where the deviations of free Ca2+ concentration were 150-300 nM, to compare the effects of changes in free Ca2+ concentration on IICR. We purified the IP3R by the immunoaffinity method using the anti-IP3R1 antibody as described previously(9Nakade S. Rhee S.K. Hamanaka H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6735-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the homogeneity of the IP3R1, existence of IP3R type 2 (IP3R2) and type 3 (IP3R3) in the purified IP3R was analyzed by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies to each type of IP3R. The same amount of [3H]IP3 binding activity of cerebellar microsomal fraction and the purified IP3R (1.5 pmol of IP3R/lane) were applied to the gel, followed by immunoblotting with the monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 1). The cerebellar microsomal fraction showed strong immunoreactivity with mAb 18A10 against IP3R1 and little with mAbs KM1083 and KM1082 against IP3R2 and IP3R3, respectively. The purified IP3R also showed strong immunoreactivity with mAb 18A10 and little with mAbs KM1083 and KM1082, and the contents of IP3R2 and IP3R3 in the purified receptors which might form heterotetramer with IP3R1 (31Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Sugiyama T. Yoneshima H. Yamamoto-Hino M. Furuichi T. Saruta T. Hasegawa M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14700-14704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) were very small and decreased after the immunoaffinity purification in comparison with the cerebellar microsomal fraction. These results showed that the purified IP3R was chiefly composed of homotetramers of IP3R1. A recent immunohistochemical study also indicated that rat cerebellum contains three IP3R types whose expressing cell types are quite distinct; IP3R1 is well known to be enriched in Purkinje cells, IP3R type 3 (IP3R3) is in Bergmann glia and astrocytes, and IP3R type 2 (IP3R2) is also present, but not in neurons and astrocytes(27Yamamoto-Hino M. Miyawaki A. Kawano H. Sugiyama T. Furuichi T. Hasegawa M. Mikoshiba K. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The differential localization of each IP3R type in cerebellar cell types indicate that most IP3R•channel complexes in the cerebellum are homotetramers within single cells. The immunoaffinity-purified IP3R was reconstituted into lipid vesicles by the dialysis method described previously(9Nakade S. Rhee S.K. Hamanaka H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6735-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The liposomes were observed using electron microscopy. The average diameter of the liposome was 170 ± 50 nm (n = 300), and the distribution of the size was represented in single peak (data not shown). IP3-induced Ca2+ efflux from the proteoliposomes was monitored as fluorescence changes of fluo-3, whose values were used to calculate total Ca2+ concentrations outside the proteoliposomes. The profiles of IICR were highly reproducible. Free Ca2+ concentrations prior to addition of IP3 were approximately 100 and 200 nM using 10 and 1 μM of fluo-3, respectively, throughout the experiments. Following the addition of maximal concentrations of IP3, 10 μM of Ca2+ ionophore Br-A23187 was added to estimate the fraction of liposomes with the purified IP3R. About 6% of the total released Ca2+ by Br-A23187 responded to IP3, indicating 6% of the liposome were reconstituted with the purified IP3R. Fig. 2 shows a typical profile of IICR by the immunoaffinity-purified IP3R reconstituted into lipid vesicles. Five-hundred nanomolar IP3-induced Ca2+ release from the liposomes followed a constant leakage of Ca2+ (Fig. 2A), which was linear over the time range of the experiments. The rate of leak from the liposomes was calculated to be about 1.5 nM/s. The net IICR (Fig. 2B) was obtained by extrapolating and subtracting the constant Ca2+ leakage (Fig. 2A, the solid line) from the profile. The net IICR could not be fitted by a single exponential but was found to be a biexponential (Equation 1) (Fig. 2C, the solid line) with the fast and slow rate constants (kfast = 0.51 ± 0.01 s−1 (71 ± 1%), kslow = 0.042 ± 0.001 s−1 (29 ± 1%)), indicating that the purified IP3R has two states for IICR. Δ[Ca2+]total=T(1−Afast⋅e−kfast⋅t−Aslow⋅e−kslow⋅t)(Eq. 1) where T represents a total amount of released Ca2+, A is the amplitude of the fast and slow components (percent) (Afast+ Aslow = 100%), k is the rate constant (s−1), and t is time (s). Different concentrations of IP3 were added to obtain dose-response curves. Fig. 3 shows typical time courses of IICR observed using the same batch of proteoliposomes. Submaximal concentrations of IP3 caused partial Ca2+ releases, and rates of Ca2+ release were dependent on the IP3 concentration. Each profile of IICR consisted of the sum of two single exponentials as described in Fig. 2C and Fig. 6.Figure 6:Biexponential analysis of IP3-induced Ca2+ release: IP3 dependence of the rate constants (A and B) and the amplitudes (C and D). All profiles of IICR was found to be biexponential, with the fast and slow rate constants as described in the legend to Fig. 1 and in the text (Equation 1). The fast (squares) and slow (circles) rate constants (A and B) and the amplitudes of the fast (squares) and slow (circles) (C and D) were plotted as a function of the concentration of IP3. A and C were measured at 10 μM fluo-3 (values are mean ± S.D., n = 3-4; initial free Ca2+ concentration = 100 nM; deviations of free Ca2+ concentration by the released Ca2+ = 10-30 nM) and B and D at 1 μM fluo-3 (values are mean ± S.D., n = 2-5; initial free Ca2+ concentration = 200 nM; deviations of free Ca2+ concentration by the released Ca2+ = 150-300 nM).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Relative amounts of released Ca2+ at various concentration of IP3 are shown in Fig. 4, A (n = 3-4) and B (n = 2-5). The amount of released Ca2+ increased as a function of IP3 concentration, indicating that the single type of IP3R is capable of producing the quantal response of Ca2+ release. The initial rates of Ca2+ release varied with IP3 concentrations and saturated above 1 μM IP3 at both fluo-3 concentrations of 10 μM (Fig. 5A, n = 3-4; deviations of [Ca2+]free = 10-30 nM) and 1 μM (Fig. 5B, n = 2-5; deviations of [Ca2+]free = 150-300 nM). Both half-maximal initial rates of IICR in the presence of 10 and 1 μM fluo-3 occurred at 100 nM. We determined the degree of cooperativity of IICR by Hill plotting (Fig. 5C, n = 3-4 and 5D, n = 2-5). The slopes in the Hill plot over the range of submaximal concentrations of IP3 (20-200 nM) were calculated to be 1.8 ± 0.1 (Fig. 5, C and D), indicating that the IICR of the purified IP3R exhibited positive cooperativity. As the EC50 value and the Hill coefficient of IICR at both concentrations of fluo-3 were calculated to be the same, the changes of free Ca2+ concentration by the released Ca2+ had no significant effect on the sensitivity for IP3 and the cooperativity of IICR. To analyze the kinetic features of IICR in detail, we attempted to curve fit the profiles of IICR. As mentioned above, the profile of IICR could not be fitted by a single exponential but could be fitted to a biexponential with the fast and slow rate constants (Equation 1) at both concentrations of fluo-3. The rate constants of the fast and slow components differed by a factor of about 10 (Fig. 6, A (n = 3-4) and B (n = 2-5)). Both the fast and slow rate constants were influenced by the concentration of IP3. The amplitudes of both states (Afast and Aslow) were plotted as a function of the concentrations of IP3 (Fig. 6, C (n = 3-4) and D (n = 2-5)). Afast increased as the concentration of IP3 increased, whereas Aslow decreased. Considering these amplitudes with the amount of total released Ca2+ (Fig. 4), the amounts of released Ca2+ by the fast and slow phases were then calculated. The amounts of released Ca2+ by the fast and slow components relative to the total released Ca2+ at 5 μM IP3 were plotted as a function of the concentrations of IP3 (Fig. 7, A (n = 3-4) and B (n = 2-5)). The amount of released Ca2+ by the fast component increased as a function of the concentration of IP3, whereas the amount by the slow component remained almost constant over the range of 10-5000 nM IP3 at both concentrations of fluo-3. This result revealed that the fast phase of IICR, with the time constants of 0.3-0.7 s−1, was mainly responsible for the quantal Ca2+ release. There are many reports characterizing the properties of IICR using permeabilized cells and microsomal preparations, which have been complicated by the following factors. (i) Composition of subtypes of IP3Rs: the presence of multiple IP3R types in single cells may affect the kinetics of IICR. (ii) Metabolism of IP3: IP3 could easily be metabolized by specific kinases and phosphatases which may be present in crude systems. The concentration of ligand during experiments is known to be one of the critical factors for IICR, since most IICR properties (multiple affinity sites on single IP3Rs, quantal release by submaximal doses, inactivation by IP3 itself) are dependent on IP3 doses. (iii) Ca2+ pump: the activity of the ATP-driven Ca2+ pump affects IICR by refilling Ca2+ stores following Ca2+ release. This prevents us from evaluating the cooperativity of IICR by reducing the net IICR to a great extent at low concentrations of IP3 than at high concentrations(2Champeil P. Combettes L. Berthon B. Doucet E. Orlowski S. Claret M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17665-17673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (iv) Molecules sensing changes in Ca2+ concentration: dynamic changes in cytosolic and luminal Ca2+ concentrations have been argued to be involved in functional regulation of IICR properties by modifying the function of the IP3R itself and by activating IP3R modulator proteins (e.g. protein kinases (e.g. Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C) and phosphatases (e.g. calcineurin) and Ca2+-binding proteins (e.g. calmodulin) and IP3-metabolizing enzymes (e.g. IP3 kinase)). (v) Heterogeneity in IICR-Ca2+ pools: there is a subcellular heterogeneity in IP3 sensitive Ca2+ stores, e.g. subsurface cisternae, calciosomes, nuclear membranes, etc., which may have different IICR properties. Artificial effects on IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores by experimental conditions must be considered, e.g. fusion of cisternae membranes by excess treatment with saponin (32Renard-Rooney D.C. Hajnoczky G. Seitz M.B. Schneider T.G. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23601-23610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and induction of formation of cisternal stacks mediated by IP3Rs by nonphysiological treatment(33Takei K. Mignery G.A. Mugnaini E. Sudhof T.C. De Camilli P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 327-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the kinetics of IICR of the immunoaffinity-purified and reconstituted IP3R, excluding the possibility of modulation of IICR by factors other than Ca2+ and IP3 itself. Furthermore, as the immunoaffinity-purified IP3R showed very strong immunoreactivity with the monoclonal antibody against IP3R type 1 and little with the monoclonal antibodies against IP3R types 2 and 3, the population of the immunoaffinity-purified IP3R was almost homogeneous of IP3R1 but contained very small amounts of IP3R2 and IP3R3. Therefore the results derived from the analysis of this purified IP3R reflect mainly the properties of IP3R1. Due to the absence of IP3 metabolizing enzymes, in our system, applied IP3 doses should be constant throughout each experiment. However, we must consider the regulation of the IP3R by changes in free Ca2+ concentration. Feedback regulations of IICR by the released Ca2+ have been observed in permeabilized cells (14Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1103-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 16Iino M. Endo M. Nature. 1992; 360: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and microsomal systems(4Finch E.A. Turner T.J. Goldin S.M. Science. 1991; 252: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 15Watras J. Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3239-3245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the high concentrations of Ca2+ chelators and Ca2+ indicators caused artificial effects on IICR in those experiments(18Combettes L. Champeil P. Science. 1994; 265: 813-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34Richardson A. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11528-11533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, to avoid problems concerning the regulation of IICR by the released Ca2+, we used high enough concentration of fluo-3 to keep extravesicular free Ca2+ concentration within 100-130 nM. We also used 1 μM fluo-3, 200-500 nM free Ca2+ concentration, to compare the effect of changes of extravesicular free Ca2+ by IICR on the kinetics of Ca2+ release. At both fluo-3 concentrations, where the extravesicular free Ca2+ concentration changed from 100 to 130 nM (10 μM of fluo-3) and from 200 to 500 nM (1 μM of fluo-3), the kinetics of the Ca2+ release was essentially the same, indicating little feedback regulation by the released Ca2+ in our system. We also observed similar kinetics of Ca2+ release at the initial extravesicular free Ca2+ concentration of 300 nM (data not shown), where Ca2+ release using cerebellar microsomes was shown to be inhibited(35Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). Feedback regulation by the released Ca2+ or the regulation by Ca2+ outside of pools may be mediated by the action(s) of other molecules which can sense changes of Ca2+ concentration. The extent of cooperativity of Ca2+ release is an important and fundamental issue for understanding the channel opening mechanism. In previous reports, there is a controversy about the cooperativity of IICR, i.e. no cooperativity (4Finch E.A. Turner T.J. Goldin S.M. Science. 1991; 252: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 15Watras J. Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3239-3245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or positive cooperativity (nH = 2) (2Champeil P. Combettes L. Berthon B. Doucet E. Orlowski S. Claret M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17665-17673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Somlyo A.V. Horiuti K. Trentham D.R. Kitazawa T. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22316-22322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (nH = 4) (3Meyer T. Wensel T. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) has been demonstrated. The Hill plots of the initial rates of Ca2+ release by the purified IP3R (Fig. 5, C and D) showed a positive cooperativity (nH = 1.8 ± 0.1) at submaximal concentrations of IP3. This cooperativity was observed in the presence of both 10 μM and 1 M fluo-3, indicating that at least two molecules of IP3 is needed for channel opening and that the positive cooperativity could not be due to sensitization of IICR by the rise in free Ca2+ concentration, i.e. by the released Ca2+. This result shows that the positive cooperativity of IICR could be mediated by a single type of IP3R. The dose-response curves of IICR mediated by the purified IP3R showed that the amount of released Ca2+ increased as a function of IP3 concentration (Fig. 4) and provided evidence to suggest that the purified IP3R, which was chiefly composed of IP3R1, can exhibit the quantal response of Ca2+ release. Ferris et al.(36Ferris C.D. Cameron A.M. Huganir R.L. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1992; 356: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have also reported that conventionally purified and reconstituted cerebellar IP3Rs showed the quantal response and suggested that heterogeneity of IP3R types was a possible mechanism underlying quantal Ca2+ release. However, it is likely that the quantal Ca2+ release is an intrinsic property of IP3R1. The profiles of IICR mediated by the purified IP3R did not obey a single exponential but were found to be biexponential with the fast and slow rate constants. The rate constants of the fast and slow components were calculated to be 0.3-0.7 and 0.03-0.07 s−1, respectively. We also analyzed the contribution of the fast and slow components to the total amounts of released Ca2+, which were estimated as described in. The amounts of released Ca2+ by the fast component increased as a function of the concentration of IP3, whereas those by the slow component were constant. These results suggest that the fast component is kinetically the state of low affinity for IP3 and high permeability of Ca2+, and the slow component is of high affinity and low permeability. Consistent with this view, the studies of IP3 binding in permeabilized hepatocytes and a liver plasma membrane-enriched fraction displayed the existence of two states with high and low affinity for IP3(37Pietri F. Hilly M. Mauger J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17478-17485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Pietri F. Hilly M. Claret M. Mauger J.P. Gastroenterol. Clin. Biol. 1990; 14: 710-714PubMed Google Scholar). Since our data show that the fast phase of Ca2+ release increases with increasing IP3 concentrations and the slow phase remains constant, it appears that the fast phase is the determinant of the amount of Ca2+ release and is responsible for the quantal Ca2+ release. Recently, heterogeneity of IP3R densities in pools, which had equal sensitivity to IP3, was reported to be responsible for biphasic Ca2+ release(39Hirose K. Iino M. Nature. 1994; 372: 791-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). If this is the reason for biphasic nature of IICR, the amplitudes of the fast and slow components in the curve fitting should be independent to the IP3 concentrations, and the ratio of the amounts of released Ca2+ by the fast and slow components must be constant. Because in such an assumption, the amplitudes and the ratio of the amounts of released Ca2+ should reflect the distribution of such heterogeneity, i.e. proportion of IP3-sensitive Ca2+ pools with high and low density of IP3R reflect the amplitudes and the ratio of amounts of the released Ca2+ by the fast and slow phases, respectively. However, in our experiments, the amplitudes of the fast and slow components and the ratio of the total released Ca2+ were dependent on IP3 concentrations, indicating that the biphasic nature of Ca2+ release was not due to such heterogeneity of receptor density. A possibility of heterogeneity in the size of individual Ca2+ pools was also excluded by the same reasons and by the direct observation using electron microscopy as described under “Results.” The present study has demonstrated that the purified IP3R has two states with different affinity for IP3, i.e. a low affinity and a high affinity state. This could arise from alternative splicing leading to the production of variants of IP3R1(40Nakagawa T. Okano H. Furuichi T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Alternatively, there may be two different states of a single IP3R due to an IP3-dependent inactivation or a Ca2+-dependent interconversion. In the absence and presence of changes in extravesicular free Ca2+ concentrations, we observed the biphasic nature of IICR, indicating that the changes in the free Ca2+ concentration may not be responsible for the biphasic kinetics. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the released Ca2+ causes an instantaneous and local rise in Ca2+ concentrations near the channel pore, which cannot be promptly chelated by fluo-3, and would mediate the interconversion of the two states. If the released Ca2+ instantaneously rises near the channel pore, in cooperation with IP3, the inactivation of the IP3R reported by Hajnoczky et al.(41Hajnoczky G. Thomas A.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) may be caused by the interconversion of IP3R. This hypothesis could be supported by the observations in Fig. 3 of (41Hajnoczky G. Thomas A.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), where the degree of inactivation (interconversion) varied with the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations during the preincubation with IP3 and IP3R, whereas no significant change in IICR at various cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations were observed without preincubation. We demonstrated here the positive cooperativity of IICR and the quantal Ca2+ release phenomenon of IICR by the purified IP3R, which was mainly composed of a single type of IP3R (IP3R1), and the biphasic nature of IICR, which had kinetically two states to release Ca2+. The purification and reconstitution of other types of IP3Rs may reveal new insights into IICR and may allow us to relate any differences in the kinetic properties of IICR to the differences in the structure of the different types of IP3R. Also, this will allow us to observe the effects of modulators, such as protein kinase A, ATP, Ca2+, etc. on type-specific IICR. We thank Drs. Michio Niinobe and Shinji Nakade for their help in purification of IP3R and fruitful discussions, Dr. Eisaku Katayama for electron microscopic analysis, Dr. Lee G. Sayers for critical reading of the manuscript, and all the members of Mikoshiba Laboratory for their support."
https://openalex.org/W2014721850,"Photoreactive analogues of prenyl diphosphates have been useful in studying prenyltransferases. The effectiveness of analogues with different chain lengths as probes of recombinant human protein prenyltransferases is established here. A putative geranylgeranyl diphosphate analogue, 2-diazo-3,3,3-trifluoropropionyloxy-farnesyl diphosphate (DATFP-FPP), was the best inhibitor of both protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) and protein geranylgeranyltransferase-I (PFFT-I). Shorter photoreactive isprenyl diphosphate analogues with geranyl and dimethylallyl moieties and the DATFP-derivative of farnesyl monophosphate were much poorer inhibitors. DATFP-FPP was a competitive inhibitor of both PFT and PGGT-I with Ki values of 100 and 18 nM, respectively. [32P]DATFP-FPP specifically photoradiolabelled the beta-subunits of both PFT and PGGT-I. Photoradiolabelling of PGGT-I was inhibited more effectively by geranylgeranyl diphosphate than farnesyl diphosphate, whereas photoradiolabelling of PFT was inhibited better by farnesyl diphosphate than geranylgeranyl diphosphate. These results lead to the conclusions that DATFP-FPP is an effective probe of the prenyl diphosphate binding domains of PFT and PGGT-I. Furthermore, the beta-subunits of protein prenyltransferases must contribute significantly to the recognition and binding of the isoprenoid substrate."

These three ASTs were separated by high resolution anion exchange chromatography and were designated Q1, Q2, and Q3. Q1 and Q2 had high N-OH-2AAF sulfonation activity, whereas Q3 showed low activity. Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis showed Q1-Q3 to be comprised of 33,945- and 35,675-Da protein subunits. Q1 contained only the 35,675-Da protein subunit, Q2 contained equal quantities of 33,945- and 35,675-Da subunits, and Q3 contained only the 33,945-Da subunit. The subunit compositions of Q1-Q3 were confirmed by immunochemical analysis. Size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography confirmed that the active quaternary structure of the three isoenzymes was dimeric. Analysis of liver cytosols for the relative contributions of Q1-Q3 to total cytosolic N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity indicated that Q1, Q2, and Q3 accounted for 44, 46, and 10% of the activity, respectively. These results demonstrate the existence of both homodimeric and heterodimeric aryl sulfotransferases and show that two ASTs, a homodimer of 35,675-Da subunits and a heterodimer of a 33,945- and a 35,675-Da subunit, are primarily responsible for hepatic N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity.

Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis showed Q1-Q3 to be comprised of 33,945- and 35,675-Da protein subunits. Q1 contained only the 35,675-Da protein subunit, Q2 contained equal quantities of 33,945- and 35,675-Da subunits, and Q3 contained only the 33,945-Da subunit. The subunit compositions of Q1-Q3 were confirmed by immunochemical analysis. Size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography confirmed that the active quaternary structure of the three isoenzymes was dimeric. Analysis of liver cytosols for the relative contributions of Q1-Q3 to total cytosolic N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity indicated that Q1, Q2, and Q3 accounted for 44, 46, and 10% of the activity, respectively. These results demonstrate the existence of both homodimeric and heterodimeric aryl sulfotransferases and show that two ASTs, a homodimer of 35,675-Da subunits and a heterodimer of a 33,945- and a 35,675-Da subunit, are primarily responsible for hepatic N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity. Cytosolic sulfotransferases have been shown to catalyze the PAPS 1The abbreviations used are: PAPS3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfateASTaryl sulfotransferaseHASThydroxylamine sulfotransferaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyN-OH-2AAFN-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluoreneLCliquid chromatographyPSTphenol sulfotransferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. -dependent sulfonation of a wide variety of hydroxylated endobiotic and xenobiotic compounds (1Jakoby W.B.

Whereas the primary function of xenobiotic sulfoconjugation is to permit detoxication of the compound, it occasionally results in the production of highly reactive intermediates capable of causing genotoxic and cytotoxic damage to cells. One sulfotransferase activity that has been studied with great interest is that responsible for the sulfoconjugation of N-hydroxyarylamic acids and N-hydroxyarylamines(5Miller E.C. Miller J.A.

Sulfuric acid esters of N-OH-2AAF have been implicated in the in vivo production of the N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)- and 3-(deoxyguanosin-N2-yl)-2AAF DNA adducts in rat liver (11Meerman J.H.N. Beland F.A.

In addition, carcinogen-mediated loss of this activity among rat liver cells, putatively initiated for carcinogenesis, has been suggested to contribute to the development of a resistance phenotype to carcinogen toxicity(9Ringer D.P.

Runge-Morris M.A. Coughtrie M.W.H. Chem. Biol. Interact.1994: 1-378Google Scholar). It has been suggested previously that a principal source for liver cytosolic N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity is aryl sulfotransferase IV (AST IV)(1Jakoby W.B. Sekura R.D. Lyon E.S. Marcus C.J.

This enzyme was reported to be a dimeric molecule comprised of two identical subunits of known amino acid sequence and a subunit mass of 33,906 Da(19Yerokun T. Etheredge J.L. Norton T.R. Carter H.A.

Purif. 1992; 3: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The primary sequence for the AST IV subunit is identical to the deduced amino acid sequences reported for cDNAs of phenol sulfotransferase (PST-I; (21Ozawa S. Nagata K. Gong D. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)) and for minoxidil sulfotransferase(22Hirshey S.J. Dooley T.P. Reardon I.M. Heinrikson R.L. Falany C.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 257-264PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, two additional sources of liver cytosolic N-OH-2AAF activity have been reported, HAST-I and HAST-II(23Gong D.W. Ozawa S. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). HAST-II was shown to have a higher enzymatic activity toward N-OH-2AAF than HAST-I and to be cross-reactive with a polyclonal antibody raised against HAST-I. Recently, the HAST-I polyclonal antibody was used to isolate an HAST-I cDNA clone, ST1C1(24Nagato K. Ozawa S. Miyata M. Shimade M. Gong D.-W. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24720-24725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cDNA was found to code for a 35,768-Da protein that displayed high N-OH-2AAF sulfoconjugation activity when transfected and expressed in COS-1 cells. The 36-kDa HAST-I protein was found to have a 51% amino acid sequence homology with the 34-kDa PST-1/AST IV protein. In order to further evaluate the role of AST IV as an N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase, studies were conducted to determine the possible contribution of the 34-kDa and 36-kDa sulfotransferase subunits to AST IV activity. The use of improved purification techniques and protein characterization methodologies have revealed the presence of three sulfotransferase forms. The first form is a homodimer of two 33.9-kDa subunits, which shows low N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity. A second form is a homodimer comprised of two 35.7-kDa subunits and has the highest level of N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity. The third form is a heterodimer comprised of a 33.9-kDa and a 35.7-kDa protein subunit, possessing high catalytic activity for N-OH-2AAF sulfonation. The existence of heterodimeric sulfotransferases constitutes a new, previously unreported level of sulfotransferase organization. DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow, MonoQ HR 5/5 anion exchange column, PhastGel 10-15% gradient polyacrylamide gels, and nitrocellulose membranes were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Ceramic hydroxylapatite, Tris-HCl, and all Western blot immunochemical reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. A Reliasil C18 300-Å, 5 μM (2 mm × 15 cm) reversed phase HPLC column was purchased from Michrom Bioresources (Pleasanton, CA).

N-OH-2AAF was purchased from Chemsyn Science Laboratories (Lenexa, KS). PAPS was obtained from Dr. Sanford Singer (University of Dayton, Dayton, OH). Dithiothreitol, sucrose, 2-mercaptoethanol, glycerol, trifluoroacetic acid, methanol, and acetonitrile were purchased from Fisher. Tris-hydrochloride was purchased from Amresco (Solon, OH). Monobasic potassium phosphate was purchased from J.T. Baker. 2-Naphthol was purchased from Aldrich. ATP-agarose and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Aryl sulfotransferases were purified from livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats (Sasco Inc., Omaha, NE) by a modified procedure of Ringer et al.(17Ringer D.P. Norton T.R. Howell B.A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5301-5307PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, chromatography was performed using previously reported gradient conditions but substituting DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and ceramic hydroxylapatite for DE52 and Bio-Gel HT, respectively. Following hydroxylapatite chromatography, fractions enriched in N-OH-2AAF sulfonation activity were pooled (HA1), and fractions enriched in 2-naphthol sulfonation activity were pooled (HA2). HA1 and HA2 fractions were dialyzed and applied individually to ATP-agarose, as described previously(17Ringer D.P. Norton T.R. Howell B.A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5301-5307PubMed Google Scholar). Following ATP-agarose chromatography, HA1 and HA2 fractions were dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.25 M sucrose, 5% glycerol, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) and individually applied to a MonoQ HR 5/5 anion exchange column. Chromatography was done using FPLC (Pharmacia) at room temperature, with a gradient elution of buffer A and buffer A containing 1.0 M NaCl (buffer B). The gradient elution was performed as follows; sample injection was followed by an 8-min wash with buffer A, 0% B to 20% B in 55 min, 20% B to 100% B in 5 min, 3 min wash with 100% B, followed by reequilibration in buffer A. Flow rate for analysis was 1 ml/min, and absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and peaks were pooled, concentrated, and final protein concentration determined by absorbance at 215 nm. An extinction coefficient of 15 at 215 nm was used for a 1 mg/ml protein solution(25Scopes R.K. Cantor C.R. Protein Purification: Principles and Practice. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag, New York1987: 278-283Google Scholar). N-OH-2AAF sulfonation activity was determined by HPLC using the procedure of Yamazoe et al.(26Yamazoe Y. Manabe S. Murayama N. Kato R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 536-541PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, a typical reaction mixture contained 50 μM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 250 μM PAPS, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 μMN-OH-2AAF, and 0.5 μg of purified sulfotransferase or 30 μl of a chromatography fraction in a final volume of 100 μl. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37°C and terminated by the addition of 200 μl of acetonitrile. N-OH-2AAF sulfoconjugation was quantitated by HPLC. When indicated, N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity was determined using a trapping assay in which the sulfuric acid ester of [14C]N-OH-2AAF reacted with methionine-agarose beads(17Ringer D.P. Norton T.R. Howell B.A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5301-5307PubMed Google Scholar). The colorimetric determination of 2-naphthol sulfotransferase activity at pH 5.5 described by Jacoby (27Jacoby W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 197-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was routinely used to monitor elution of sulfotransferases during column chromatography. p-Nitrophenol sulfotransferase activity was determined at pH 5.5 essentially as described by Gong et al.(23Gong D.W. Ozawa S. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme (0.5-1.0 μg) and incubated for 10 min at 37°C, and the product was subsequently quantitated by HPLC. The apparent kinetic values for sulfotransferases were determined from a single time point under initial velocity conditions, compensating for substrate inhibition kinetics using the formula v = VA/(K + A + (A2/Ki))(28Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). The Q1 and Q3 samples used for kinetic analysis contained less than 0.05% 33.9-kDa and 35.7-kDa subunit contamination, respectively. Purified fractions of ASTs were analyzed by C18 reversed phase HPLC using a Waters 625 LC system equipped with a column heater, 486 variable wavelength detector, and the Millennium 2010 chromatography manager. Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and a column temperature of 30°C. Absorbance was monitored at 215 nm. The column was equilibrated before analysis with an aqueous solution of 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (C). A gradient elution was done using 90% acetonitrile with 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid in water (D) as follows. Sample was injected followed by a 3 min wash with 100% C, gradient was started from 0% D to 50% D in 7 min, 50% D to 75% D in 25 min, 75% D for 3 min, followed by reequilibration with C. Purified sulfotransferases were analyzed using an electrospray tandem quadropole mass spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Sciex model API III, Toronto, Canada). Some samples were analyzed by first isolating purified isoenzyme peaks from C18 reversed phase HPLC analysis, followed by direct injection into the mass spectrometer. Alternatively, samples were analyzed in the LC/mass spectrometry mode by injection of samples onto an Ultrafast Microprotein Analyzer microbore HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources Inc., Pleasanton, CA) with a 1 mm × 15-cm 300-Å Reliasil C18 reversed phase column. The column was equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 2% acetonitrile in water, and the sample was eluted directly into the mass spectrometer nebulizer with a 20-min 45-75% gradient of 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid and 90% acetonitrile in water. Size exclusion HPLC analysis was done using a Waters 510 pump, 486 variable wavelength detector, and the Millennium Chromatography Manager. Proteins were eluted isocratically with a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 M sucrose, 5% glycerol, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and absorbance was monitored at 215 nm. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected for activity and A280 analysis. Cytosol (5 ml) prepared as described above was fractionated by preparative DEAE-HPLC using the procedure of Gong et al.(23Gong D.W. Ozawa S. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two Waters 510 pumps controlled by the Millennium Chromatography Manager were used for gradient delivery and absorbance at 280 nm was monitored using a Waters 486 detector. Fractions of 3 ml were collected and analyzed for 2-naphthol and N-OH-2AAF sulfoconjugation activity as described above. Single dimension SDS-PAGE of proteins was performed using a Pharmacia PhastSystem following the procedure of Ringer et al.(17Ringer D.P. Norton T.R. Howell B.A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5301-5307PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of 1-4-μl aliquots containing 0.1-2.0 μg of protein were applied to the gel. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the Pharmacia PhastTransfer electrophoretic transfer system. Before transfer, the nitrocellulose membrane was prewetted with 25 mM Tris, pH 8.3, containing 192 mM glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol. Transfer conditions were 12.5 mA/gel for 5 V-h at 15°C. Following transfer, immunochemical detection of sulfotransferases was performed using the Bio-Rad Immun-Blot assay kit and gold enhancement kit as described previously(17Ringer D.P. Norton T.R. Howell B.A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5301-5307PubMed Google Scholar). Immunochemically stained bands were quantitated using a digital image analysis system (Fotodyne Foto/Eclipse, Hartland, WI). In some experiments the sulfotransferase polyclonal primary antibody was pretreated with purified 33.9- or 35.7-kDa protein to confer immunostaining specificity. Typically, 0.1-2 μg of the 33.9- or 35.7-kDa subunit/ml of antibody buffer was used to pretreat the polyclonal antibody at room temperature for 1 h before incubating the membrane with the antiserum. Aliquots containing 50 μg of C18 reversed phase HPLC-purified protein were digested with trypsin (30:1, w/w) for 17 h at 37°C in the presence of 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5. Amino acid sequence analyses were performed using a model 470A gas-phase protein sequencer equipped with a model 120A on-line phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) according to standard procedures(29Hewick R.M. Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Dreyer W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7990-7997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfotransferase identification was based on alignment of tryptic peptide amino acid sequences with the previously published deduced amino acid sequences for PST-1 (21Ozawa S. Nagata K. Gong D. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and ST1C1(24Nagato K. Ozawa S. Miyata M. Shimade M. Gong D.-W. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24720-24725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The principal features for the conventional purification of AST IV (16Sekura R.D. Jakoby W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 211: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) involved fractionation of AST IV from the AST I and II isoforms by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, followed by separation of AST IV from the AST III form by hydroxylapatite chromatography. Final separation of AST IV from the remaining protein contaminants was accomplished by PAPS elution from an ATP-agarose affinity column. Shown in Fig. 1a is a typical protein elution profile from the hydroxylapatite column (Bio-Rad Bio-Gel HT) in which two peaks of sulfotransferase activity are observed, HA1 and HA2. As defined previously(16Sekura R.D. Jakoby W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 211: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the first eluting peak (HA1) corresponds to AST IV, whereas the second peak (HA2) may correspond to the previously identified but uncharacterized AST III. The HA1 and HA2 peak regions were further purified by ATP-agarose affinity chromatography, and their characteristics are shown in Fig. 1b. Both fractions showed sulfotransferase activity for 2-naphthol and N-OH-2AAF, with AST IV (HA1) having relatively greater activity for N-OH-2AAF and HA2 having relatively greater activity for 2-naphthol. Furthermore, upon SDS-PAGE, each peak produced a single band of approximately 34 kDa when either silver-stained for protein or immunochemically stained with polyclonal antiserum raised against AST IV in agreement with previous reports (17Ringer D.P. Norton T.R. Howell B.A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5301-5307PubMed Google Scholar, 30Duffel M.W. Binder T.P. Hosie L. Baden H.A. Sanders J.A. Knapp S.A. Baron J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 36-44PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1b). To assess the possible existence of multiple forms of AST IV, ATP-agarose affinity-purified HA1 and HA2 fractions were subjected to MonoQ anion exchange chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2, HA1 (AST IV) and HA2 were subsequently resolved into three peaks of sulfotransferase activity, named Q1, Q2, and Q3 on the basis of elution order. Evaluation of peaks for N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity showed strong activity for Q1 and Q2, whereas Q3 had low but detectable levels. In contrast, 2-naphthol sulfotransferase activity was found to be lower in Q1 than in Q2 and Q3. Despite the distinct chromatographic and enzymatic characteristics, SDS-PAGE analysis of Q1, Q2, and Q3 showed each was comprised of a single 34-kDa band and were thus indistinguishable from AST IV. To determine whether the basis for the heterogeneity in AST IV and HA2 represented different aggregation states of the sulfotransferase dimer, the protein elution profiles for Q1, Q2, and Q3 were determined by high performance size exclusion chromatography. As shown in Fig. 3, the results of this analysis indicated that the activity profiles of all three forms, although showing slightly different retention times, co-migrated with the dimer position. To further evaluate the basis for the Q1, Q2, and Q3 dimer heterogeneity, subunit composition was assessed by subjecting the dimeric forms to C18 reversed phase chromatography. Elution profiles showed (Fig. 4) that Q1 and Q3 were each comprised of a single protein peak with distinct elution positions. In contrast, the Q2 profile contained two protein peaks of equivalent size, which eluted at positions corresponding to the Q1 and Q3 peaks. Subsequent reversed phase liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry of protein peaks found in Q1, Q2, and Q3 (Fig. 5) indicated that Q1 contained a single component with a mass of 35,675 ± 3 Da and that Q3 was comprised of a single component with a mass of 33,946 ± 4 Da. Mass spectrometry of the two protein peaks observed in Q2 were found to have masses identical to the masses for Q1 and Q3. The mass for the Q3 protein approximated the theoretical mass of an N-terminally acetylated form of the deduced amino acid sequence from the PST-1 cDNA(21Ozawa S. Nagata K. Gong D. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), i.e. 33,951 Da. The mass of the protein comprising Q1 did not closely correspond with any reported sulfotransferase amino acid sequence. However, since it displayed high N-OH-2AAF activity, the possibility existed that it was a modified form of the ST1C1 subunit comprising HAST-I(24Nagato K. Ozawa S. Miyata M. Shimade M. Gong D.-W. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24720-24725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-Acetylation following the removal of the N-terminal methionyl residue of the ST1C1 subunit would result in a mass of 35,679 Da.Figure 5:Mass spectrometry analysis of the protein subunits comprising the sulfotransferase isoforms Q1, Q2, and Q3. Molecular mass determination by mass spectrometry of the subunit peaks A and B, isolated by C18 reversed phase HPLC of Q1, Q2, and Q3, was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A representative mass spectra, spectral data, and corresponding masses are shown for peak A (a) and B (b).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further assess the identity of the sulfotransferase subunits found in Q1, Q2, and Q3, N-terminal amino acid sequencing was attempted on purified subunit proteins. Both subunits were found to be N-terminally blocked and thus were subjected to tryptic digestion followed by chromatographic isolation of peptides and subsequent analysis of peptides for amino acid sequence. As shown in Table1, amino acid sequencing of peptides showed that the subunit comprising Q1 was homologous to ST1C1 (24Nagato K. Ozawa S. Miyata M. Shimade M. Gong D.-W. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24720-24725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the subunit for Q3 was homologous to PST-1(21Ozawa S. Nagata K. Gong D. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that cytosolic N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity is a sum of the activities of three different dimer forms in which Q1 is an ST1C1•ST1C1 homodimer, Q2 is an ST1C1•PST-1 heterodimer, and Q3 is a PST-1•PST-1 homodimer.Table I Open table in a new tab The relative sulfotransferase kinetic capacities of the three dimers comprising AST IV were determined using N-OH-2AAF and p-nitrophenol as sulfonyl acceptors (Table2). Samples of Q1 and Q3 used for kinetic analysis contained less than 0.05% 33.9-kDa and 35.7-kDa contaminating subunit, respectively. For N-OH-2AAF, Q1-Q3 Kmvalues were similar, whereas Vmax values ranged over a 30-fold span. Q1 had the highest Vmax value, whereas Q2, the heterodimer, had values approximately 50% those of Q1, and Q3 had a Vmax value that was about 10-fold lower than that of Q2. The kinetic values using p-nitrophenol as substrate show a slightly different pattern. The Km value for Q3 was about 10-fold lower than those for Q1 and Q2. The p-nitrophenol Vmax values were grouped over 4-fold range with Q1>Q2>Q3. The high level of N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity observed for Q1, the ST1C1 homodimer, and the relatively low activity found in Q3, the PST-1 homodimer, indicated that the ST1C1 subunit was the primary source for this activity in AST IV.Table II Open table in a new tab Experiments were performed to assess the general contribution of Q1, Q2, and Q3 to cytosolic N-OH-2AAF activity and confirm the presence of heterodimer (Q2) in cytosol prior to purification procedures. Fresh liver cytosol was fractionated on a DEAE-HPLC column and evaluated for the presence of peaks corresponding to Q1, Q2, and Q3. As shown in Fig. 6, analysis of chromatographic fractions for N-OH-2AAF and 2-naphthol sulfotransferase activity showed three well resolved peaks. These peaks eluted in regions corresponding to the previously observed positions for Q1, Q2, and Q3. The relative contributions to total cytosolic N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity were 44%, 46%, and 10% for the Q1, Q2, and Q3 regions, respectively. The identities of the Q1-Q3 peaks were confirmed by immunochemical analysis of fractions corresponding to the apex of each of the three DEAE-HPLC peaks (Fig. 7). These fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot immunochemical analysis using a polyclonal antibody to AST IV that had been preabsorbed with either the ST1C1 (35.7 kDa) or PST-1 (33.9 kDa) subunit before use. As shown in Fig. 7a, preabsorption of the polyclonal antiserum to AST IV with purified ST1C1 or PST-1 subunit was able to confer immunostaining specificity to the antiserum for the detection of each subunit. Furthermore, these conditions were shown to be applicable for use in liver cytosols (Fig. 7a, lanes6 and 7), where preabsorption of the antiserum with both subunits lowered immunostaining of sulfotransferase in cytosol to background levels. As shown in Fig. 7(b and c), the first DEAE activity peak (labeled Q1), which showed high N-OH-2AAF sulfonation activity and lower 2-naphthol sulfonation, stained only for the presence of the ST1C1 subunit. The second peak (labeled Q2), which showed intermediate levels of both sulfotransferase activities, stained for the presence of both the ST1C1 and PST-1 subunits. The last peak (labeled Q3), which showed high 2-naphthol sulfonation activity and low levels of N-OH-2AAF sulfonation activity, stained only for the presence of the PST-1 subunit. These results established the existence of Q2 in the freshly prepared cytosol and supported the position that Q2 is an important source of N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity in vivo.Figure 7:Immunochemical analysis of sulfotransferase subunit compositions of fractions from DEAE-HPLC of male cytosol. The apex fractions from the sulfotransferase peaks labeled Q1, Q2, and Q3 in Fig. 6 were evaluated by Western blot immunohistochemical analysis for the presence of the 33.9-kDa and 35.7-kDa subunits. Panel a demonstrates the ability of the polyclonal antiserum to be used for detection of the two subunits: lanes1 and 2, 0.1 μg of 33.9-kDa subunit; lanes 3-5, 0.1 μg of 35.7-kDa subunit; lanes6 and 7, 2 μg of cytosol protein. Immunochemical staining was performed with polyclonal antibody pretreated as follows: lanes2 and 4, preabsorbed with purified 33.9-kDa subunit; lanes5 and 7, preabsorbed with both 33.9-kDa and 35.7-kDa subunits. In panels b and c, lanes1-3 contained 0.1 μg of Q1, Q2, and Q3, respectively. The immunochemical staining was performed with sulfotransferase polyclonal antiserum preabsorbed with 33.9-kDa subunit in b and 35.7-kDa subunit in c.

The three dimers, Q1, Q2, and Q3, were elucidated by subjecting purified AST IV to high performance liquid chromatography with an anion exchange resin. Each dimer was shown to have N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity, and upon SDS-PAGE generated a single 34-kDa band that stained positively upon Western immunochemical staining with polyclonal antiserum to AST IV. Denaturation of the individual native AST IV dimers to monomers by reversed phase HPLC showed that each dimer had a unique subunit composition, and established reversed phase HPLC as an important tool for examining heterogeneity of dimer composition. Subsequent analysis of the subunits by mass spectrometry and amino acid sequencing provided a basis for the structural identification of the three dimers. This approach has allowed a definitive determination of sulfotransferase subunit composition. Q1 was shown to be a homodimer comprised of a 35,675 ± 3-Da protein subunit, which, based upon partial amino acid sequence analysis, was found to be homologous to the ST1C1 sulfotransferase subunit ((24Nagato K. Ozawa S. Miyata M. Shimade M. Gong D.-W. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24720-24725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); deduced amino acid sequence molecular mass of 35,768 Da). Q1 showed high N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity and may correspond to the HAST I sulfotransferase whose composition also included the ST1C1 subunit (24Nagato K. Ozawa S. Miyata M. Shimade M. Gong D.-W. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24720-24725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Q3 dimer was shown to be a homodimer comprised of a protein subunit with a molecular mass of 33,946 ± 4 Da and amino acid sequence homologies that identified it as the PST-1 sulfotransferase subunit ((21Ozawa S. Nagata K. Gong D. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); deduced amino acid sequence molecular mass of 33,906 Da). It showed significant but much lower N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase capacity than the Q1 homodimer and had also been implicated previously as a source of N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity(16Sekura R.D. Jakoby W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 211: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Yerokun T. Etheredge J.L. Norton T.R. Carter H.A. Chung K.H. Birckbichler P. Ringer D.P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4779-4786PubMed Google Scholar). The Q2 dimer was found to be a heterodimer comprised of one 35.7-kDa subunit (ST1C1) and one 33.9-kDa subunit (PST-1). It possessed a high N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase capacity, which was approximately 50% that of the ST1C1 homodimer (Q1). Q2 appeared to have an anion exchange chromatography elution position similar to that of a partially characterized sulfotransferase termed HAST II, which had been previously characterized as having strong N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity and reacting positively to an antiserum raised against ST1C1(23Gong D.W. Ozawa S. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of the N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activities for the three dimers indicated that the ST1C1 homodimer (Q1) was approximately 40 times more catalytically efficient than the PST-1 homodimer (Q3) and approximately 1.5-fold more efficient than the heterodimer (Q2). Kinetic analysis of p-nitrophenol sulfotransferase activities among the three dimers indicated a different pattern of catalytic efficiencies. The PST-1 homodimer (Q3), was approximately 3-fold more efficient than the ST1C1 homodimer (Q1) and 6-fold more efficient than the heterodimer (Q2). These results indicated that subunit-subunit interactions may have a role in determining dimer catalytic properties. Although these studies indicated that sulfoconjugation of N-OH-2AAF to its highly reactive sulfuric acid ester form was most efficiently catalyzed by a ST1C1-containing sulfotransferase dimer, the actual in vivo contribution of the various dimer forms was less predictable since other factors, including relative dimer abundance and tissue localization, must be taken into account. Studies reported here involving analysis of cytosol suggested that the heterodimer (Q2) was a principal source of N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity in vivo. Identification of Q2 as an ST1C1•PST-1 heterodimer constitutes the first report of a functional heterodimeric sulfotransferase. Heterodimeric proteins have been shown to be important in cellular functions ranging from the regulation of gene expression by heterodimeric nuclear transcription factors (31Cole M.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 715-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar) to the metabolism of xenobiotics by heterodimeric detoxication enzymes(33Pickett C.B. Lu A.Y.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 743-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). For nuclear transcription factors, heterodimer interactions change the availability or specific activity of factors for modulating gene expression. In the case of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases, heterodimeric interactions produce new dimers that increase the detoxifying functions of cells(34Sato K. Adv. Cancer Res. 1989; 52: 205-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The xenobiotic detoxifying or bioactivating properties of glutathione S-transferases in rats have been shown to be a result of tissue-specific (35Robertson I.G.C. Jensson H. Mannervik B. Jernstrom B. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and/or sex-specific (36Hayes J.D. Nguyen T. Judah D.J. Petersson D.G. Neal G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20707-20717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) patterns of subunit expression, resulting in formation of catalytic homodimers and permitted heterodimers. Similarly, the existence of heterodimeric sulfotransferases introduces a new level of functional diversity for this family of detoxication enzymes. Furthermore, there is considerable evidence that expression of sulfotransferases in rat liver are also regulated in a sex-specific manner(8DeBaun J.R. Miller E.C. Miller J.A. Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 577-595PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ringer D.P. Norton T.R. Howell B.A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5301-5307PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gong D.W. Ozawa S. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J. Biochem.

Carcinogenesis. 1991; 21: 1259-1264Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the rat liver N-hydroxyarylamine sulfotransferases HAST I and HAST II have been reported to be male-dominant and male-specific, respectively(23Gong D.W. Ozawa S. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). If these sulfotransferases, as suggested above, correspond to Q1 (ST1C1 homodimer) and Q2 (PST-1•ST1C1 heterodimer), respectively, then it may be concluded that the higher N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity observed in male liver cytosols (8DeBaun J.R. Miller E.C. Miller J.A. Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 577-595PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ringer D.P. Norton T.R. Howell B.A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5301-5307PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gong D.W. Ozawa S. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) arises from the presence of the male-dominant (homodimer) and male-specific (heterodimer) forms. Future studies to assess the regulatory basis for sex-specific sulfotransferase subunit expression and the extent to which homodimer/heterodimer formation occurs are needed to provide further insight into the role(s) that sulfotransferases have in xenobiotic metabolism. The existence of heterodimeric sulfotransferases also introduces a new level of structural complexity as an enzyme family. Heterodimer formation among glutathione S-transferases is typically restricted to subunits with homologies of 70-90%(33Pickett C.B. Lu A.Y.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 743-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 34Sato K. Adv. Cancer Res. 1989; 52: 205-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In contrast, the amino acid sequence homology between the subunits for the PST-1 and ST1C1 is reported to be only 51%(24Nagato K. Ozawa S. Miyata M. Shimade M. Gong D.-W. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24720-24725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, there have been no investigations of the requirements for sulfotransferase dimer association and dissociation, and little is known about the sulfotransferase domains responsible for dimerization. Questions such as whether sulfotransferase heterodimer formation is restricted to specific subclasses of sulfotransferases or is a common property of all sulfotransferases are subjects for future investigations.

Both PGE2 and A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, elevated the cGMP content of isolated parietal cells. The A23187-induced channel opening was abolished by methylene blue, a guanylate cyclase inhibitor.

Deprivation of these factors has been shown to result in the cessation of both cell growth and nuclear division, and the cells become arrested in a quiescent state known as G0(36Naeve G.S. Sharma A.

Cells arrested in this manner may remain in G0 for days or weeks without a significant decrease in viability.

Zullo J. Verma I.M. Stiles C.D. Science. 1984; 226: 1080-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Activation of these factors is probably necessary to induce the expression of sets of genes whose products are essential for progression through the cell cycle. Previous studies have revealed that NF-κB also fits into this category of serum-induced or immediate-early genes(49Baldwin A.S. Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Beg A.A. Coodly L.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4943-4951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the addition of serum to G0-arrested 3T3 cells has been shown to induce both nuclear translocation of NF-κB and κB-directed transcriptional activation. However, while NF-κB is induced at the G0 to G1 transition, it is unknown whether this is the only stage of the cell cycle at which NF-κB induction can occur. In addition, it is unclear whether induction of NF-κB is associated with changes in the distribution of cells at different points of the cell cycle. Here we show, using cell cycle analysis of 3T3 cells and the G2 mutant mouse mammary carcinoma line, FT210(50Th'ng J.P. Wright P.S. Hamaguchi J. Lee M.G. Norbury C.J. Nurse P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 313-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), that NF-κB may be activated with equivalent efficiency in both proliferating and arrested cells. Furthermore, we show that activation of NF-κB has no effect on the rate of progression or checkpoint arrest throughout cell cycle. We conclude that NF-κB may be induced in both a cell cycle-dependent and -independent manner and suggest a model in which distinct signaling mechanisms can lead to NF-κB activation. The four-copy κB CAT plasmid and the κB mutant CAT control plasmid have been described previously(18Perkins N.D. Schmid R.M. Duckett C.S. Leung K. Rice N.R. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The RSV-β-galactosidase plasmid used to standardize transformation efficiency was a kind gift of Dr. B.-Y. Wu. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin, and serum starvation conditions were established as described previously(49Baldwin A.S. Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Beg A.A. Coodly L.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4943-4951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FT210 and FM3A cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 33°C as described previously(50Th'ng J.P. Wright P.S. Hamaguchi J. Lee M.G. Norbury C.J. Nurse P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 313-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). FT210 cells were synchronized at G2/M by incubation at 39°C for 48 h. 3T3 cells (106) were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature and washed twice with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted as described above. Pellets were taken up in 0.5 ml of nuclear staining solution (0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide, made as a 10 × stock in 1.12% sodium citrate, 0.3% Triton X-100) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. RNase A (0.5 ml, 6.5 Kunitz units/ml) was added, and cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Fluorescence measurements were accumulated to form a distribution curve of DNA content. Fluorescence events due to debris were substracted before analysis. Areas under the curve representing the G0/G1, S, and G2+M phases of the cell cycle were then calculated. 3T3 cells were cotransfected with 10 μg of κB reporter plasmid or mutant κB-CAT plasmid and 10 μg of RSV-βgal by the calcium phosphate procedure as described previously (49Baldwin A.S. Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Beg A.A. Coodly L.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4943-4951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications: cells were plated to 25% confluence 20 h prior to transfection. The culture medium was replaced 12 h after transfection with medium containing 0.5% serum or, as a control, 10% serum. Cells were maintained for a total of 48 h from the time of transfection to the time of harvest for CAT assays. Where indicated, media was replaced with fresh media containing 20% serum or 200 units/ml of TNF-α 12 h prior to harvest. FT210 and FM3A cells were transfected with 10 μg of κB reporter plasmid or control plasmid by the DEAE-dextran method(7Schmid R.M. Perkins N.D. Duckett C.S. Andrews P.C. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). For temperature shift experiments, FT210 or FM3A cells were transferred to a 39°C incubator 4 h after transfection and incubated further for 44 h. Cellular extracts were prepared as described previously(7Schmid R.M. Perkins N.D. Duckett C.S. Andrews P.C. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford(51Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215589) Google Scholar). 3T3 extracts were standardized by cotransfection of β-galactosidase expression vectors prior to CAT assays. FT210 and FM3A cells were standardized by protein concentration. CAT assays were performed as described previously(52Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Osborn et al.(23Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). EMSA analysis was performed essentially as described previously(19Duckett C.S. Perkins N.D. Kowalik T.F. Schmid R.M. Huang E.S. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes encompassing the HIV κB site were labeled by the Klenow enzyme with [32P]dCTP (ICN). Nuclear extracts (4 μg) were incubated in a 20-μl reaction containing 2 × 104 counts/min radiolabeled probe and 1 μg of poly d[I•C]-poly d[I•C] at room temperature for 10 min and loaded without dye onto a 0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 10 V/cm at room temperature for 3 h. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak AR-5 film at −70°C using intensifying screens. To determine whether activation of NF-κB required active cell cycling, 3T3 cells were transfected with either a HIV κB-responsive reporter plasmid or a negative control containing mutated versions of the κB site, deprived of serum for 24 h, treated with either serum or TNF-α, and maintained for a further 12 h before harvest. The addition of serum to growth-arrested cells was found to potently activate κB-mediated transcription (Fig. 1), consistent with earlier studies(49Baldwin A.S. Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Beg A.A. Coodly L.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4943-4951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the addition of TNF-α to either serum-deprived or cycling cells also stimulated equivalent levels of κB-dependent gene expression (Fig. 1). A similar result was observed following stimulation with interleukin-1 (data not shown). To confirm that the activation of κB-directed gene expression by TNF-α in serum-starved cells correlated with the induction of a nuclear, κB-specific DNA binding activity, EMSA analysis was performed. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cycling or growth arrested cells which had been either mock treated or stimulated with TNF-α and incubated with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe containing a single copy of the HIV κB site. An NF-κB-like binding activity was induced by treatment with TNF-α in both cycling and growth arrested cells (Fig. 2). Competition analysis with unlabeled wild type and mutant κB sites confirmed the specificity of this activity (lanes 6 and 7). The NF-κB proteins induced by TNF-α treatment have previously been shown to be composed of p50 and p65 subunits; supershift analysis of NF-κB induced in cycling versus serum-deprived cells revealed their subunit composition to be identical (data not shown). These findings suggest that NF-κB can be induced by TNF-α irrespective of the cycling state of the cell. The previous experiments revealed that NF-κB induction by TNF-α occurs at equivalent levels in both cycling and serum-deprived 3T3 cells. One possible explanation for this finding is that the process of NF-κB activation can itself release the cells from the G0 block. To test this possibility, 3T3 cells which had been subjected to different degrees of serum deprivation were stimulated with TNF-α, treated with propidium iodide, and analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry and FACScan analysis. The addition of TNF-α to cycling cells had no observable effect on the distribution of cells at various stages of the cell cycle (Fig. 3 C, Table 1). Furthermore, while serum deprivation was found to arrest greater than 70% of cells in G0/G1 (Fig. 3D, Table 1), the cell cycle distribution following addition of TNF-α to serum-deprived cells was essentially unchanged (Fig. 3F, Table 1). This finding strongly suggests that, in contrast to the induction of NF-κB by the addition of serum to serum-deprived cells, NF-κB activation by TNF-α occurs in a manner which is independent of the cycling state of the cell. In addition, these data suggest that the process of NF-κB activation does not immediately alter cell cycle progression.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To verify that NF-κB may be activated by cytokines regardless of their point in the cell cycle, NF-κB induction was examined in FT210 murine mammary carcinoma cells, which can be readily growth arrested at a different point in the cell cycle. The FT210 cell line is a temperature-sensitive G2 phase mutant, resulting from a mutation in the cdc2 kinase gene(50Th'ng J.P. Wright P.S. Hamaguchi J. Lee M.G. Norbury C.J. Nurse P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 313-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). While cell growth and division is unimpaired at the permissive temperature of 33°C, cells incubated at the non-permissive temperature of 39°C rapidly arrest at the G2/M boundary. To evaluate the properties of NF-κB induction at G2/M, FT210 cells or the wild type parental line FM3A were transfected in parallel with the κB reporter plasmid, and responsiveness to TNF-α was determined at both permissive and non-permissive temperatures. TNF-α was able to induce CAT expression, specifically through the κB sites, at both 33 and 39°C (Fig. 4). As shown previously(50Th'ng J.P. Wright P.S. Hamaguchi J. Lee M.G. Norbury C.J. Nurse P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 313-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), FT210 cells maintained at the non-permissive temperature of 39°C were completely arrested at G2/M (Fig. 4C). To confirm that κB-directed expression correlated with the activation of NF-κB, nuclear extracts from both resting and stimulated FT210 cells were compared by EMSA. Analysis of extracts prepared from TNF-α-treated cells revealed the presence of a κB-specific binding activity (Fig. 5). This nucleoprotein complex was observed in extracts which had been grown at both 33 and 39°C but only following TNF-α stimulation. Interestingly, no activation of NF-κB was observed using a common inducing agent, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), in either FM3A or FT210 cells (Fig. 5; data not shown), suggesting that additional activation pathways may also exist which are defective in this cell line. Taken together, the experiments performed in FT210 cells suggest that NF-κB is also induced at the G2/M boundary by TNF-α.Figure 5:Induction of NF-κB activity by TNF-α in G2/M-arrested FT210 cells. FT210 cells were incubated for 24 h at 39°C and stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA or 200 units/ml TNF-α for 2 h. Preparation of nuclear extracts and EMSA were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The arrow indicates the position of the inducible, κB-specific nucleoprotein complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cellular growth and differentiation is regulated by a combination of growth factors which are present in serum at nanomolar to picomolar concentrations. Addition of serum growth factors to G0-arrested cells induces a set of genes, often encoding transcription factors, whose products are required for progression into G1 and continued cell growth. Previous studies have demonstrated that NF-κB represents an immediate-early response gene (49Baldwin A.S. Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Beg A.A. Coodly L.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4943-4951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like other immediate-early response genes, induction of NF-κB occurs in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors(49Baldwin A.S. Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Beg A.A. Coodly L.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4943-4951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar) presumably due to its presence as a covert, cytoplasmic complex with IκB. As shown previously(49Baldwin A.S. Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Beg A.A. Coodly L.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4943-4951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we find that NF-κB is inducible following serum addition to serum-deprived cells. However, we also find that NF-κB induction in response to TNF-α occurs in a cell-cycle independent fashion. The data reveal that NF-κB can be induced in serum-deprived cells by cytokines (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). At least two possibilities existed to account for these effects. First, the activation of NF-κB might itself be sufficient to induce checkpoint release, leading to re-entry into the cell cycle. Second, the activation of NF-κB by cytokines might occur independently of cell cycle, predicting that NF-κB induction alone would not change the cell cycle profile. The data presented in Fig. 3 appear to fit the second model; induction of NF-κB in G0-arrested cells by TNF-α did not dramatically affect the cell cycle profile, while in the same experiment the addition of serum almost completely relieved the G0 arrest. Under some conditions, TNF-α stimulation has been shown to shorten the duration of S phase(54Volland S. Amtmann E. Sauer G. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 56: 696-705Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), but this finding was not observed in our experimental system, using a different cell type and alternative conditions of growth arrest (Fig. 3, Table 1). The addition of TNF-α to G2/M-arrested FT210 cells induced NF-κB (Figure 4:, Figure 5:), providing further support for this model. Interestingly, in both 3T3 and FT210 cells, a significant degree of cell death was observed after TNF-α addition to arrested cells, starting 2-3 h following addition of cytokine. 2C. S. Duckett and G. J. Nabel, unpublished observations. This effect was not observed with IL-1 which, at least in 3T3 cells, induced NF-κB to the same extent as TNF-α (data not shown). This result suggests that the signaling events leading to cell death by TNF-α are mediated by the Fas-related domains (55Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar) and is therefore a consequence of apoptosis rather than induction of NF-κB per se. Considering the rapid kinetics of induction (seconds to minutes), as well as its ability to be induced in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors(53Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar, 56Baeuerle P.A. Lenardo M. Pierce J.W. Baltimore D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 53: 789-798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NF-κB is a good candidate as both an immediate-early, cell cycle-responsive factor, and a cytokine-induced, cell cycle-independent factor. It is most likely that alternative signal transduction pathways are utilized in these two different events. In support of this hypothesis, much evidence has accumulated suggesting the involvement of serine-threonine kinases, including protein kinase C, in the cytokine-induced (cell cycle-independent) activation of NF-κB(30Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 57Shirakawa F. Mizel S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2424-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 58Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). However, the observation that PMA was unable to induce NF-κB in FT210 cells suggests that protein kinase C-independent pathways of NF-κB activation might also exist, as described previously in another cell type(23Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Analysis of cytoplasmic extracts following cellular stimulation has revealed that only a fraction of NF-κB relocates to the nucleus.2 This suggests that there may be distinct cytoplasmic stores of NF-κB, perhaps associated with different isoforms of IκB. These forms could be subject to modification by distinct kinases and phosphatases, allowing for regulation by distinct signaling pathways. Furthermore, several studies have raised the possibility of distinct pathways being involved in the cell cycle-dependent induction of NF-κB. The first of these is the implication that the addition of platelet-derived growth factor, an event which activates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, to serum-starved 3T3 cells can induce NF-κB(49Baldwin A.S. Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Beg A.A. Coodly L.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4943-4951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, stimulation of the T cell costimulatory molecule, CD28, has been shown to induce NF-κB(59Ghosh P. Tan T.-H. Rice N.R. Sica A. Young H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1696-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Finally, induction of NF-κB by some stimuli can be blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, but this reagent is unable to inhibit NF-κB induction by TNF-α(60Iwasaki T. Uehara Y. Graves L. Rachie N. Bomsztyk K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We therefore speculate that independent signaling pathways converge to activate similar NF-κB family members. It remains to be determined whether this convergence occurs upstream of IκB, for example, by regulation of a kinase of IκB(61Li S. Sedivy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9247-9251Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), downstream by modification of the NF-κB family members themselves (62Neumann M. Tsapos K. Scheppler J.A. Ross J. Franza Jr., B.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2095-2104PubMed Google Scholar) or at the level of IκB itself, perhaps by differential phosphorylation or degradation. The dissection of these signaling events, as well as the levels at which they converge, will provide insight into the cell cycle-dependent and -independent mechanisms of cellular and viral gene regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2054762171,"The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) origin binding protein, OBP, is a DNA helicase specifically stimulated by the viral single strand DNA-binding protein, ICP-8. The stimulation is dependent on direct protein-protein interactions between the C-terminal domain of OBP,ΔOBP, and ICP 8 (Boehmer, P. E., Craigie, M. C., Stow, N. D., and Lehman, I. R.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 29329-29334). We have now observed that this interaction is dramatically influenced by the nature of the DNA ligand. Stable complexes between ΔOBP, ICP 8, and double-stranded DNA, presented either as a specific duplex oligonucleotide or a restriction fragment containing the HSV-1 origin of replication, oriS, can be detected by gel chromatography and gel electrophoresis. In contrast, a single-stranded oligonucleotide, oligo(dT)65, will completely disrupt the complex between ΔOBP and ICP 8. We therefore suggest that the interaction between ΔOBP and ICP 8 serves to position the single strand DNA-binding protein with high precision onto single-stranded DNA at a replication fork or at an origin of DNA replication. The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) origin binding protein, OBP, is a DNA helicase specifically stimulated by the viral single strand DNA-binding protein, ICP-8. The stimulation is dependent on direct protein-protein interactions between the C-terminal domain of OBP,ΔOBP, and ICP 8 (Boehmer, P. E., Craigie, M. C., Stow, N. D., and Lehman, I. R.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 29329-29334). We have now observed that this interaction is dramatically influenced by the nature of the DNA ligand. Stable complexes between ΔOBP, ICP 8, and double-stranded DNA, presented either as a specific duplex oligonucleotide or a restriction fragment containing the HSV-1 origin of replication, oriS, can be detected by gel chromatography and gel electrophoresis. In contrast, a single-stranded oligonucleotide, oligo(dT)65, will completely disrupt the complex between ΔOBP and ICP 8. We therefore suggest that the interaction between ΔOBP and ICP 8 serves to position the single strand DNA-binding protein with high precision onto single-stranded DNA at a replication fork or at an origin of DNA replication. It has been suggested on the basis of studies of the replication of Escherichia coli and its phages that DNA replication is carried out by multimeric machines(1Alberts B.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp.

Numerous contacts between the proteins involved and the DNA substrate can be expected to be established and broken during the dynamic progression of the replisomes. The replication of herpes simplex virus 1 seems to be no exception. A multimeric replisome capable of rolling circle replication has recently been isolated(4Skaliter R. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10665-10669Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).

OBP is an ATP-dependent DNA helicase encoded by the UL 9 gene(6Olivio P.D. Nelson N.J. Challberg M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is a member of the helicase superfamily 2(9Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opinion Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). A remarkable feature of this protein is its ability to interact specifically with several proteins in the putative HSV-1 replisome and also with different DNA ligands(10Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc.

The interaction between OBP and double-stranded DNA has the following characteristics. It is strongly sequence specific with an approximate Kd of 0.1 nM for the specific recognition sequence CGTTCGCACTT(12Elias P. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The formation of OBP•oriS complexes is influenced by ATP and other nucleotide co-factors as well as the phasing of the recognition sequences(17Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). OBP also binds to single-stranded DNA albeit with lower affinity. This interaction results in a strong stimulation of ATP hydrolysis(7Bruckner R.C Crute J.J. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2669-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Boehmer P.E. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have identified a complex between the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of OBP and the HSV-1 single strand DNA-binding protein ICP 8(10Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Apparently, 30 amino acids at the C terminus of OBP are required to form this complex(19Boehmer P.E. Craigie M.C. Stow N.D. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction causes an approximately 10-fold stimulation of an ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity(8Fierer D.S. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3986-3995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Boehmer P.E. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Boehmer P.E.

The second component of this complex, ICP 8, binds single-stranded DNA in a cooperative way. The site occupied on single-stranded DNA has been estimated to be between 12-40 nucleotides(20O'Donnell M.E. Elias P. Funnell B.E. Lehman I.R. J. Biol.

J. Virol. 1983; 46: 661-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain of ICP 8 is localized between the amino acid residues 564 and 849(23Gao M. Bouchey J. Curtin K. Knipe D.M.

ICP 8 binds one Zinc atom and contains one Zn-finger motif at positions 499-512(27Gupte S.S. Olson J.W. Ruychean W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11413-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ICP 8 is also a component of the HSV-1 replisome as isolated by ion-exchange chromatography and may therefore bind to one or more of the UL30, UL42, UL5, UL8, or UL52 gene products(4Skaliter R. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10665-10669Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The biological role of ICP 8 is clearly to stimulate DNA replication, but it has also been implicated in homologous recombination(20O'Donnell M.E. Elias P. Funnell B.E. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4260-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Dutch R.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6945-6949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, it has recently been demonstrated that it can promote homologous pairing and strand transfer(29Bortner C. Hernandez T.R. Lehman I.R. Griffith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have now investigated how the interaction between OBP and ICP 8 is controlled by DNA ligands. Our results suggest a model where this interaction serves to position ICP 8 onto single-stranded DNA at an origin of replication. The duplex oligonucleotide PE 17/18 containing the box I sequence of HSV-1 oriS was prepared as described before(12Elias P. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2959-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A single-stranded 65-mer of oligodeoxythymidylate denoted T65 was purchased from Scandinavian Gene Systems. A uniformly labeled 300-mer of polydeoxythymidylate, T300, was synthesized with terminal transferase using 1 pmol of a 15-mer of oligodeoxythymidylate as primer and 360 pmol of [α-32P]dTTP 80 Ci/mmol. T300 was purified by chromatography on Bio-Gel P10 (Bio-Rad). The restriction fragments used in this work have been derived from the plasmid series pORI and pORI(boxImut)(17Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). pORI(wt) contained an unaltered origin sequence. The numbering of the nucleotide sequence is the same as before(17Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the plasmid pORI(boxImut), two point mutations were introduced in box I lowering the affinity for OBP by two orders of magnitude(15Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Stow N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17424-17429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A pET3A expression vector for the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of OBP (ΔOBP) was modified by the insertion of a duplex oligonucleotide introducing the amino acid sequence MetSerHis6GlyThrGly at the N terminus. The cells transformed with the pET3a/HisΔOBP plasmid were grown, induced, and harvested as described previously(15Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Stow N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17424-17429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A crude extract was prepared following published procedures(13Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Stow N.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17424-17429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification in the absence of detergent was performed on a 50 ml of Ni2+-NTA column (Qiagen) eluted with a 10-200 mM imidazole gradient in 0.1 M NaCl, 20 mM Na+-HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol. Additional purification could be achieved using chromatography on a column of S-Sepharose (Pharmacia) developed by a linear gradient consisting of 0.15 M NaCl versus 1.0 M NaCl in 20 mM MOPS adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. A BamHI fragment containing the C-terminal domain of OBP was also cloned downstream from the GST gene in the expression vector pGEX-2T (Pharmacia). Expression of GSTΔOBP and subsequent purification was performed essentially as described(30Martinez R. Edwards C.A. Protein Exp. Purif. 1993; 4: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). ICP 8 was purified from SF9 cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus vector obtained from Dr. Nigel Stow, MRC Virology Unit, Glasgow. The purification was performed as described(10Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The purity of the proteins used throughout this study was greater than 90% as estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchonininic acid (BCA) protein assay reagent (Pierce) or from Coomassie-stained SDS-gels calibrated by BSA standards. Complexes between HisΔOBP, 2 nmol or 74 μg, and ICP 8, 2 nmol or 256 μg, were formed by mixing equimolar amounts of protein in 0.2 ml of the equilibration buffer described below. Incubation was for 20 min on ice. The oligonucleotides PE 17/18, 2 nmol, or T65, 0.7 nmol, were then added as indicated and the incubation was allowed to proceed another 10 min on ice. Chromatography was performed on Superose 12 HR 10/30 (Pharmacia). The column was equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.6, 0.2 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 10% glycerol. Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min at +4°C. Fractions of 0.2 ml were collected, and the protein content was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gelectrophoresis. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 and dried. The content of ICP 8 and HisΔOBP in the fractions was determined using the computing densitometer Molecular Dynamics 300A. The chromatographic profiles of the radioactively labeled oligonucleotides PE 17/18 and T65 were determined by scintillation counting. The recovery of the individual components after chromatography was approximately 70%. The column used was calibrated with the following proteins of known molecular weights: myoglobin, 16,800; ovalbumin, 43,000; bovine serum albumin, 66,000; aldolase, 158,000; and ferritin, 440,000. The reaction mixture, 20 μl, contained 0.9 fmol of T300 and 9 pmol of ICP 8 in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mM MgCl, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 10% glycerol. 0.2 ng of micrococcus nuclease (Pharmacia) was added and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by 5 μl of 25 mM EDTA and 0.02 mg/ml sonicated calf thymus DNA. The samples were then extracted with phenol and precipitated with ethanol. They were finally analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The binding of HisΔOBP and GSTΔOBP to the duplex oligonucleotide PE 17/18 was analyzed on 7% polyacrylamide gels containing acrylamide and bisacrylamide at a ratio of 80:1 using Tris-glycine as the running buffer(17Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A reaction mixture of 10 μl contained 10 fmol of the radiolabeled duplex oligonucleotide PE 17/18 1600 Ci/mmol and HisΔOBP and GSTΔOBP as indicated in the figure legend. The incubation buffer was 0.38 M glycine, 50 mM Tris base, 2.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 0.2 mg/ml sonicated calf thymus DNA. The binding of HisΔOBP and ICP 8 to oriS was monitored in Tris-glycine buffered 6% polyacrylamide gels as described previously. The reaction mixture contained 2.5 fmol of an end-labeled restriction fragment containing oriS or a mutant version thereof in a total volume of 20 μl. The buffer was 0.38 M glycine, 50 mM Tris base, 10 mM MgCl2, 2.1 mM EDTA, 3 mM DTT, and 0.02 mg/ml BSA(17Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). HisΔOBP and ICP 8 were included as described in the figure legends. Incubation was for 10 min on ice. Electrophoresis was for 3 h at 100 V at +4°C. The dried gels were subjected to autoradiography in the presence of an intensifying screen. The binding of HisΔOBP to single-stranded DNA was analyzed in a similar gel retardation experiment. Here 3.1 fmol of T65 was mixed with 14-124 pmol of HisΔOBP in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction buffer was the same as above, and the samples were run on 6% polyacrylamide gels. The conditions for the electrophoresis were the same as above. 9.5 fmol of an EcoRI-SphI restriction fragment derived from the plasmid pORI (17Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was end labeled at the EcoRI site using [α-32P]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol). It was mixed with 5.4 pmol of HisΔOBP and 9.2 pmol of ICP 8 as indicated in the legend of Fig. 7. The reaction mixture was 20 μl and consisted of 3 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.02 mg/ml BSA. The samples were incubated 15 min on ice. They were then kept at 37°C for 3 min immediately before the addition of 0.2 units of DNase I. The cleavage reaction was allowed to proceed for 3 min at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 0.25 M EDTA and 0.01 mg/ml sonicated calf thymus DNA. The samples were extracted by phenol and precipitated with ethanol and subsequently analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. The Stability of Complexes between HisΔOBP and ICP 8 Is Determined by the DNA Ligand-Boehmer and Lehman (10Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) originally discovered that a stable and specific complex could be formed between the HSV-1 origin binding protein and ICP 8. We have now looked into the problem of how the formation of this complex is affected by two different ligands: the duplex oligonucleotide PE 17/18, also referred to as box I, corresponding to the high affinity binding site for OBP in oriS, and T65, a single-stranded oligonucleotide that will efficiently bind ICP 8. Chromatography of free HisΔOBP and ICP 8, respectively, on Superose 12 indicated molecular weights of 38,000 and 170,000 (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The expected value for ICP 8 was 128,000 calculated on the basis of amino acid sequence. Nevertheless, these values indicate that HisΔOBP and ICP 8 exist as monomers in solution.TABLE I Open table in a new tab When HisΔOBP and ICP 8 were mixed in equimolar proportions a complex was formed that eluted with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 215,000 (Fig. 1 and Table 1). This value is consistent with the formation of a heterodimer with a stoichiometry of 1:1. In an experiment where HisΔOBP and the box I duplex oligonucleotide were mixed at an equimolar ratio a complex, HisΔOBP/box I, eluted at an apparent molecular weight of 92,000. Neither free DNA nor free HisΔOBP was observed. However, if either DNA or HisΔOBP was added at a slight excess, e.g. a molar ratio of 2:1, the expected amounts of free DNA or HisΔOBP, as the case might be, could also be observed on the chromatogram (results not shown). This indicates that 1 molecule of box I can bind 1 molecule of HisΔOBP under these conditions. A recent report suggests that a single high affinity binding site from oriS may bind two C-terminal domains of OBP(31Fierer D.S. Challberg M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7330-7334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The apparently contradictory results have been obtained using different techniques, and further experiments are clearly needed to resolve this issue. The binding of ICP 8 to a single-stranded oligonucleotide was investigated in an experiment where ICP 8 and T65 were mixed in equimolar proportions. The complex ICP 8/T65 eluted at an apparent molecular weight of 850,000 (Fig. 1, a and b, and Table 1). The stoichiometry of this complex will be further discussed below. The influence of DNA ligands on the stability of the HisΔOBP-ICP 8 complex was investigated in two experiments where either the box I duplex oligonucleotide PE17/18 or T65 was added to the HisΔOBP-ICP 8 complex (Fig. 1c). In the first case all three components coeluted at a position corresponding to a molecular weight of 350,000. Speculation about the composition of this complex on the basis of its chromatographic properties might be hazardous, but it seems likely that these components might form a highly assymmetric complex with a stoichiometry of 1:1:1. In order to investigate the stoichiometry of this complex, a titration experiment was performed. The concentrations of ICP 8 and the box I duplex oligonucleotide were kept constant in the sample mixture, 3 and 1 μM, respectively. Increasing amounts of ΔOBP were then added resulting in molar ratios of ΔOBP to duplex oligonucleotide ranging from 0.3 to 3. The samples were chromatographed on Superose 12. The amount of the ternary complex, denoted I in the inset of Fig. 2, was determined as shown in Fig. 2. Similarly, we measured the amount of the free duplex box I oligonucleotide represented by the second peak in the chromatogram of Fig. 2. Our results from the titration experiments indicate that maximal amounts of ternary complexes are obtained at approximately an equimolar ratio of ΔOBP to duplex box I oligonucleotide. We believe that the slight deviation from the theoretical value of 100% can be explained by a dissociation of components in the complex during chromatography. In the second experiment we examined the influence of the single-stranded oligonucleotide T65 on the formation of a HisΔOBP-ICP 8 complex. The striking observation was made that HisΔOBP was completely displaced from the complex and the previously described ICP 8-T65 complex emerged (Fig. 1d). We speculate that a conformational change of ICP 8 induced by single-stranded DNA caused this effect. To further address the stoichiometry of the complex formed between ICP 8 and single-stranded DNA, we subjected this complex to digestion with micrococcus nuclease. A single-stranded polynucleotide, T300, was synthesized by terminal transferase in the presence of [α-32P]dTTP. Complexes between ICP 8 and the uniformly labeled single-stranded polynucleotide T300 polynucleotide were then digested with micrococcus nuclease. The cleavage products were subjected to electrophoresis on sequencing gels. The results revealed a periodic pattern of protection. The repeating unit was exactly 14 nucleotides (Fig. 3). The single-stranded oligonucleotide T65 used in the gel filtration experiments above could therefore bind four ICP 8 monomers. We have also investigated the interaction between HisΔOBP and single-stranded DNA. An experiment using the gel retardation technique shows that HisΔOBP can bind to a single-stranded oligonucleotide at high concentrations (Fig. 4). Furthermore, in experiments employing quenching of tryptophane fluorescens as a method of detecting an interaction between HisΔOBP and T65 we have noted that HisΔOBP binds to T65 with an apparent Kd of 10−7M. 2C. M. Gustafsson, unpublished observations. The complexes formed under these conditions have a stoichiometry of 1:1. However, when complexes between HisΔOBP and T65 were examined in protection experiments using micrococcus nuclease there was no indication of a protection resulting in a repeating pattern. Furthermore, we were never able to isolate complexes between HisΔOBP and T65 using chromatography on Superose 12 as described above. We interpret these results to mean that the interaction between HisΔOBP and single-stranded DNA is weak and non-cooperative. We have tried to define the stoichiometry of the complexes formed between ΔOBP and a single binding site corresponding to the box I duplex oligonucleotide. Initial experiments using gel filtration on Superose 12 demonstrated that HisΔOBP and GSTΔOBP both occurred as monomers in solution (results not shown). The formation of complexes between these proteins and the box I duplex oligonucleotide was then examined in gel retardation experiments. HisΔOBP and GSTΔOBP were mixed with the box I duplex oligonucleotide. For each protein only one complex with the duplex oligonucleotide was observed (Fig. 5). When the two proteins were mixed prior to the addition of the box I duplex oligonucleotide two species were detected. The mobilities of these complexes were identical with those previously seen. There was no indication of the formation of a new species corresponding to a heterodimer of HisΔOBP and GSTΔOBP (Fig. 5). Our observations are in agreement with those made by Martin et al.(32Martin D.W. Munoz R.M. Oliver D. Subler M.A. Deb S. Virology. 1994; 198: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using truncated versions of OBP translated in vitro. The results presented in the first part of this investigation showed that the stability of the interaction between OBP and ICP 8 is influenced by the presence of a DNA ligand. We have now examined the possibility that OBP can recruite and deliver ICP 8 to single-stranded DNA appearing at oriS during the process of initiation of DNA replication. Early in this series of investigations we noted that the behavior of HisΔOBP was somewhat unpredictable. It was unstable under dilute conditions and formed aggregates or precipitated at concentrations above 2 mg/ml (results not shown). The addition of bovine serum albumin or ICP 8 tended to stabilize the protein and improve its ability to interact with DNA (results not shown). In the experiments described below, we have therefore always included BSA in the reaction mixtures. We have previously noted that HisΔOBP sustained the formation of one unique complex with a box I duplex oligonucleotide. The HSV-1 origins of replication contains two good binding sites for OBP, boxes I and II. An altered form of oriS has been made. In this case the affinity of box I for OBP was reduced by two orders of magnitude by the introduction of two point mutations in oriS creating oriS(boxI mut)(13Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Stow N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 267: 17424-17429Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). When a restriction fragment containing oriS(boxI mut) was used in gel retardation experiments it was evident that there was only one complex formed with HisΔOBP (Fig. 6, lane 3). If ICP 8 alone was added to this restriction fragment we could not detect the formation of a stable complex (Fig. 6lane 2). However, when ICP 8 and HisΔOBP were included in the same reaction mixture we now could observe the formation of novel complexes (Fig. 6, lanes 4-6). Strikingly, we could observe a gradual shift of the HisΔOBP/oriS(boxI mut) complex toward a more slowly migrating species. When ICP 8 was added in excess there was no further change in the electrophoretic mobility of the complex (Fig. 5, lane 6). The slowly migrating complex clearly contains ICP8, HisΔOBP and oriS, but the stoichiometry is uncertain. We then looked at the interaction between HisΔOBP, ICP 8, and restriction fragments containing oriS where the distance between box I and box II had been altered. We could also in this case observe that ICP 8 promoted the formation of a slowly migrating complex. The mobilities of the complexes containing oriS(boxI mut) or oriS(wt) obtained in the presence of excess ICP 8 appeared to be identical (results not shown). Furthermore, the formation of this species was independent of the distance between box I and box II (Fig. 7). We interpret these results tentatively in the following way: ICP 8 and HisΔOBP bind boxes I and II of oriS forming a complex in which two ICP8/HisΔOBP heterodimers bind to 1 molecule of oriS (Fig. 11a). The interaction with box I and II seems to be distance independent and non-cooperative. We also suggest that ICP 8 seems to further enhance the affinity of HisΔOBP for DNA allowing the formation of the slowly migrating complexes also in the presence of a mutated box I (Fig. 6). Finally, we wanted to examine the effect of single-stranded DNA on the formation complexes between ICP 8, HisΔOBP and oriS. We then observed that the addition of the single-stranded oligonucleotide T65 completely prevented ICP 8 from binding to a complex between HisΔOBP and oriS (Fig. 8). It has previously been seen that OBP binds efficiently to boxes I and II of oriS. Under certain conditions a weaker interaction with box III can also be detected(15Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Stow N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17424-17429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The AT-rich spacer sequence, however, does not seem to interact with the protein. We have now used the DNase I footprinting technique to investigate how ICP 8 interacts with oriS (Fig. 9). Our results revealed that HisΔOBP bound boxes I and II in oriS, but it did not affect the cleavage pattern of the AT-rich sequence. ICP 8 alone did not produce any footprint on oriS at all. In contrast, the simultaneous presence of ICP 8 and HisΔOBP resulted not only in a footprint covering boxes I and II, but it also gave a distinct protection of a part of the AT-rich sequence (Fig. 9 and 10). Notably, the phosphodiester bond of nucleotide 43 of oriS was cleaved very poorly in the presence of ICP 8 (Fig. 10). There was no change in the DNase I cleavage pattern either upstream of box I or downstream of box II (Fig. 9). These observations indicate that boxes I and II are functionally assymmetric and that ICP 8 is positioned in the immediate vicinity of the AT-rich spacer sequence (Fig. 11a). We also investigated the structure of the complex formed between ICP 8, HisΔOBP and oris(boxI mut) in the same way. We observed full protection of box II but a much weaker footprint at box I. In addition, the phosphodiester bond at position 49 in the AT-rich sequence was shielded from DNase I cleavage (results not shown). In this experiment box II apparently served as the strong binding site for HisΔOBP thereby delivering ICP 8 to a position at the spacer sequence closer to box II. The synthesis of chromosomal DNA is carried out by replication machines or replisomes(1Alberts B.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 2Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar, 3Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These multimeric machines are assembled in an orderly manner at unique locations on DNA, and it has become an important objective to identify the interactions that lead to the assembly of the replication apparatus and keep it together. Less is known about how these interactions are controlled in order to allow the dynamic progression of a replisome along the DNA template. The replication of herpes simplex virus DNA seems also to be carried by a machine. Recently, a complex consisting of six proteins encoded by the virus has been isolated(4Skaliter R. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10665-10669Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This complex apparently contains the proteins encoded by the UL 5, 8, 29, 30, 42, and 52 genes, and it seems to be capable of carrying out origin-independent DNA synthesis. It is assumed that the interactions that lead to the formation of this replication machine are initiated by the OBP at the viral origin of replication oriS. A considerable number of these interactions have been identified. OBP can bind directly to ICP 8, the product of the UL 29 gene, and the UL 8 protein(10Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11McLean G.W. Abbotts A.P. Parry M.E. Marsden H.S. Stow N.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 2699-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The latter is in addition a part of the trimeric helicase-primase complex coded for by the UL 5, 8, and 52 genes(33Crute J.J. Tsurumi T. Zhu L. Weller S.K. Olivo P.D. Challberg M.D. Mocarski E.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2186-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The DNA polymerase forms specific contacts with the UL 42 protein(34Digard P. Coen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17393-17396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Digard P. Bebrin W.R.

Parris D.S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5922-5931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In as much as ICP 8 is observed within the replication machine in the absence of OBP, one can easily postulate additional functionally important protein-protein interactions in which ICP 8 would take part. We have here addressed the question how the interaction between OBP and ICP 8 is affected by their DNA ligands. When the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of OBP was used we observed a specific complex between these proteins showing a stoichiometry of 1:1 in complete agreement with the results of Boehmer and Lehman(10Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the presence of a specific duplex oligonucleotide containing the recognition sequence for OBP, a complex containing all three components was observed. A titration experiment suggested that the stoichiometry of this complex was 1:1:1. However, when a single-stranded oligonucleotide was present the interactions between HisΔOBP and ICP 8 were broken. We believe that a conformational change of ICP 8 induced by single-stranded DNA rendered this protein unable to bind to OBP. In this context it is of interest to note that the intrinsic tryptophane fluorescence of ICP 8 is quenched substantially in the presence of single-stranded DNA indicating that a conformational change might have taken place(26Ruychean W.T. Olson J.W. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6273-6279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further experiments showed that a complex between ICP 8 and single-stranded DNA produced a repeating structure in which exactly 14 nucleotides were protected from nuclease cleavage by each ICP 8 monomer. The results discussed above indicate that ICP 8 might stimulate the helicase activity of OBP on model substrates by taking part in a dynamic cycle. We may assume that ICP 8 can be actively recruited to the replication fork by OBP during the first part of the cycle. The interactions between OBP and ICP 8 will then be broken allowing a precise positioning of ICP 8 on single-stranded DNA. In other words, a controlled polymerization of ICP 8 on single-stranded DNA can be expected to occur during the action of the helicase. It is, however, not known if OBP has a role at the replication fork during the infectious cycle. Possibly, the activity of OBP is restricted to a local unwinding at the origin of replication. We therefore examined if HisΔOBP could recruite ICP 8 to oriS. In the presence of ICP 8, HisΔOBP and oriS, a distinct slowly migrating complex was observed in gel retardation experiments. DNase I footprinting experiments further showed that ICP 8 was positioned close to the AT-rich spacer sequence. A tentative model for this complex could be suggested on the basis of the results presented in this article (Fig. 11a). We first assume that a single HisΔOBP monomer binds to each recognition sequence (this work, 32). It should be noted that a recent report using a different technique suggests a stoichiometry of 2:1 for this complex(31Fierer D.S. Challberg M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7330-7334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This interaction might be stabilized specifically by ICP 8. Under these conditions two ICP 8 monomers might be recruited to oriS and positioned at the AT-rich spacer sequence (Fig. 11a). The distance between the two strong binding sites for OBP in oriS is sufficient to allow this to take place. We have no indications that the conformation of the spacer sequence is affected. With this discussion in mind, one can construct a more detailed model of the initial steps occurring during the initiations of DNA replication at oriS (Fig. 11b). In this case we suggest that two dimers of OBP bind cooperatively to oriS in an ATP-dependent way(15Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Stow N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17424-17429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A total of 4 ICP 8 molecules can be bound by this complex. Two of these are positioned at the AT-rich spacer sequence. When this sequence becomes unwound ICP 8 will leave OBP and attach to DNA. In order to position the next ICP 8 molecules at the unwound region, we can imagine that OBP carries out a rolling motion induced by ATP hydrolysis perhaps analogous to the reaction performed by the rep helicase(39Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2269-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Amarunga M. Lohman T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6815-6820Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this way two dynamic cycles are coupled. In the first case the association and disassociation of ICP 8 and OBP is controlled by the availability of single-stranded DNA. The second cycle is characterized by hydrolysis of ATP dependent on single-stranded DNA. This model does not attempt to explain the molecular motions that OBP has to perform, and it does not address the role of the cooperative interactions between two OBP dimers. Are these stable enough to keep the putative tetramer intact during the continuous unwinding of DNA? Perhaps they only occur at oriS and will be broken as soon as additional replication proteins, possibly UL 8, enters the scene. It would also be of interest to see to what extent the DNA ligand can influence protein-protein interactions in other replication machines. It is, for example, interesting to note that the interaction between the gene 32 and gene 61 proteins of bacteriophage T4 might be influenced by the DNA ligand(41Burke R.L. Munn M. Barry J. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1711-1722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The eukaryotic single strand DNA-binding protein RP-A interacts with the simian virus 40-encoded helicase large T-antigen(42Dornreiter I. Erdile L.F. Gilbert I.U. von Winkler D. Kelly T.J. Fanning E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). One would like to assume that this interaction could also be a part of a dynamic cycle."

The amidase enzyme of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is produced in response to short chain aliphatic amides such as acetamide (1Kelly M. Clarke P.H. J. Gen.

Clarke P.H. Drew R.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 2041-2052PubMed Google Scholar). Positive control of amidase expression is mediated by a transcription antitermination mechanism, whereby AmiR is thought to allow RNA polymerase to read through a rho-independent transcription terminator between the amiE promoter and gene(3Drew R.E. Lowe N. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar). A second regulatory gene has been identified, amiC, which negatively regulates amidase expression(4Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and inducible amidase expression can be reconstituted in Escherichia coli with the ami E, −C, and −R genes alone. In addition, AmiC binds inducing amides, and this relieves AmiC repression of AmiR(5Wilson S.A. Wachira S.J. Drew R.E. Jones D. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3637-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The AmiC protein has been crystallized, and the structure has been solved at 2.1-Å resolution(6Wilson S.A. Chayen N.E.

FEBS Lett. 1989; 246: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and transcriptional analysis indicates that all of the amidase genes are translated from a single mRNA, approximately 5.0 kb in length, following induction. 2Wilson, S. A., and Drew, R. E. (1995) J. Bacteriol.177, 3052-3057 We have now completed the DNA sequence between amiE and amiC and downstream of amiR, and identified two further genes in this operon, amiB and amiS, thus completing the 5.3-kb nucleotide sequence and gene organization of the amidase operon. Plasmid purifications, transformations, mobilizations, and cloning were carried out as described previously (4Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction amplification was carried out using Vent DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two oligonucleotides were used for the amplification of amiB with the following sequences 5′-ATCCGAATTCGCAGAAGGAGTTTCATCCAT and 5′-TGCTGGATCCTCAGCGCCGTACGAAGCG.25 cycles of amplification were performed using the following temperatures: 95°C for 3 min; 55°C for 1 min; 73°C for 2 min. Plasmid pAS20 was used as a template(4Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strain JM109 carrying the maltose binding protein-AmiB fusion vector pSW81 was grown to an A450 of 0.5 and then induced with 1 mM IPTG. Growth was continued for a further 14 h, and then the cells were harvested. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 15% (v/v) glycerol) and sonicated as described previously(4Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-free extracts were prepared by centrifugation of the sonicated cells at 15,000 × g in a Sorvall RC2B centrifuge for 30 min. The cell-free extract was loaded onto an amylose affinity column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was subsequently washed with buffer A until a steady base line was achieved. The maltose-binding protein (MBP)-AmiB fusion protein was eluted from the column using elution buffer (buffer A + 10 mM maltose). A single large peak was collected and stored at 4°C. Gel filtration of the amylose affinity purified protein was carried out using a Superdex 200 16/10 gel filtration column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). 10 mg (5 ml) of protein was loaded onto this column equilibrated in buffer A minus NaCl. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. Soluble and insoluble crude protein extracts were prepared by sonication of cells in buffer A as described previously (4Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. The soluble supernatant was used directly and the insoluble material was resuspended in buffer A prior to analysis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of crude extracts and purified protein samples was carried out as described previously(4Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and all gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Amidase activity in intact cells was measured by the transferase assay (12Brammar W.J. Clarke P.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1964; 37: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) with acetamide as substrate. Specific activities presented correspond to 1 mmol of acethydroxamate formed per min/mg of bacteria. The ATPase activity was quantitated by a colorimetric assay(13Chan U.M. Delfert D. Junger U.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Routinely, MBP-AmiB protein was diluted with double concentrated assay buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mM MgCl2, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide) to a final volume of 250 ml. To initiate the reaction, an equal volume of ATP solution was added, to give a final concentration of 1 mM. After incubation at 37°C for 5 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of malachite green reagent. Liberated Pi was quantitated as described previously(14Henkel R.D. Vandeberg J.L. Walsh R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out in triplicate, and absorbances were measured at 630 nm. The values obtained were corrected for nonenzymatic release of Pi from ATP, GTP, CTP, and ADP and for Pi contamination. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay(15Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217450) Google Scholar). Restriction enzyme fragments from pAS20 were isolated from agarose gels as described previously (4Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ligated into appropriately cut M13mp18 or M13mp19 vectors. Single-stranded DNA from M13 recombinants for use as sequencing templates was purified by standard methods(16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequences were determined using the chain termination method for M13 recombinants using universal sequencing primer, and both strands of the DNA were sequenced. An 18-base pair oligonucleotide primer was synthesized to complete the sequencing of the amiS gene. Sequencing reactions utilized standard and 7-deaza-dGTP premixes (Pharmacia) and [35S]dATP (DuPont NEN). Codon preference and third position GC bias statistics were calculated to identify open reading frames using programs of the GCG package(17Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). Sequence similarity searches were performed using the FASTA and TFASTA program (18Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9391) Google Scholar) implemented in the GCG package. Hydropathy analyses were performed according to the method of Kyte and Doolittle (19Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17284) Google Scholar) and Stirk et al.(20Stirk H.J. Thornton J.M. Howard C.R. Intervirology. 1992; 33: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Primary sequence threading was performed as described previously(21Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar), using a set of 104 unique protein folds. Trans-membrane helix identification was performed using the method of Jones et al.(22Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3038-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Protein sequences were aligned using the programs GAP and PILEUP in the GCG package. The organization of the amidase operon and locations of amiB and amiS are shown in Fig. 1. Plasmid pAS20 carrying the wild-type amidase genes in pBR322 (4Wilson S.A. Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a source of DNA for sequencing. The nucleotide sequence of amiB is shown in Fig. 2, together with the deduced amino acid sequence. The sequence shown extends from the 3′ end of the amidase gene (amiE). There is a short intergenic region between amiE and amiB that has an inverted repeat and acts as a partial transcription terminator blocking approximately 50% of the transcripts arising from the amiE promoter.2 The correct ORF for amiB was identified using third position GC bias and codon preference plots (17Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). The amiB ORF is preceded by a ribosome binding site (underlined) and encodes a 371-amino-acid protein (42 kDa), which contains the boxes A and B of the Walker ATP binding motif (23Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). A FASTA search of the SwissProt protein sequence data base indicates that AmiB shows extensive homology with an ORF downstream of the amidase gene from Rhodococcus erythropolis(24Soubrier F. Lévy-Schil S. Mayaux Pétré J.-F. Arnaud A. Crouzet J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (39% identity, 60% similarity) (Fig. 3). The role of the R. erythropolis ORF has not been described. In addition, the FASTA search reveals AmiB is homologous to the large Clp family of proteins. AmiB shows homology with all the sub-families of the Clp proteins (A, B, and C(25Squires C. Squires C.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar)), and representatives of each subfamily are shown in the multiple alignment with AmiB in Fig. 3. The Clp proteins normally contain two ATP binding domains with a variable length spacer between them. Consequently, the Clp family proteins are approximately twice the size of AmiB and its homolog from R. erythropolis. Although AmiB shows homology with both ATP binding domains in the Clp proteins, the homology with the C-terminal ATP binding motif is highest and is shown in Fig. 3.Figure 2:Nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence for the amiB gene.

Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar) has been used to investigate the tertiary structure of the AmiB protein and to determine whether it is similar to known ATP binding proteins. The AmiB sequence was threaded onto a data base of 104 unique folds, and the results of this analysis (Fig. 4) showed that adenylate kinase had a significantly higher score than any other fold. This suggests that AmiB would adopt a similar three-dimensional structure to adenylate kinase. To confirm that AmiB is not involved in amidase induction, a plasmid was constructed with a 423-base pair in-frame ApaI deletion within amiB. The broad host range parental plasmid, pSW101, which carries the whole amidase operon from PAC1, and the amiB deletion derivative (pMW22) were mobilized into P. aeruginosa strain PAC452, which has a chromosomal deletion of the amidase locus (28Day M. Genetic Studies with Pseudomonas aeruginosa Strains, Ph.D. thesis, University of London. 1975; Google Scholar) and amidase activity measured. The parental plasmid pSW101 shows high inducible amidase expression (specific activity = 1.1 when noninduced, and specific activity = 52 when induced). The amiB deletion strain gave similar high inducible amidase expression (specific activity = 1 noninduced, and specific activity = 55 induced) showing that AmiB is not involved in the induction process. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned P. aeruginosa DNA downstream of amiR in plasmid pAS20 has been determined, and an ORF (amiS) has been identified using the third position GC bias and codon preferences. The nucleotide sequence for amiS and the deduced protein sequence are shown in Fig. 5. The AmiS sequence encodes a 172-amino-acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 18 kDa. The AmiS sequence was used to search the SwissProt and EMBL libraries, and two significant matches were found. The first to an ORF adjacent to the amidase gene from Mycobacterium smegmatis(29Mahenthiralingam E. Draper P. Davis E.O. Colston M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (40% identity; 68% similarity) and the second to the ureI gene (30Cussac V. Ferrero R. Labigne A.F. J. Bacteriology. 1992; 174: 2466-2473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (37% identity; 63% similarity) from the urease operon of Helicobacter pylori. Neither of these proteins have been ascribed a function. The striking feature of AmiS and its two homologs is the high content of hydrophobic residues, which suggests that all three may be integral membrane proteins. To test this hypothesis, hydropathy plots were produced for all three proteins (Fig. 6). In each case, the plots reveal characteristic hydrophobic regions of 18-20 amino acids, indicative of transmembrane helices, with variable length hydrophillic loop regions. AmiS and the M. smegmatis ORF appear to encode proteins with six potential transmembrane helices. The ureI gene appears to encode seven transmembrane helices. Multiple sequence alignment of the three sequences (Fig. 7) indicates significant homology between all three proteins. To confirm the membrane topology of these proteins, the program MEMSAT (22Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3038-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) was used, and the predicted transmembrane regions of the proteins are indicated in Fig. 7. MEMSAT also predicts that the N terminus would be external for each protein. The multiple sequence alignment indicates that relative insertions in the ureI sequence occur in nonmembrane loop regions and that these are least conserved between the proteins. The high level of homology between these proteins suggests that they represent a novel family of integral membrane proteins. A sequence template was generated from the aligned sequences and used to search sequence libraries; however, this failed to identify any additional family members.Figure 6:Hydropathy analysis for AmiS and homologs.

Drew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid pRW303 was mobilized into the P. aeruginosa strain PAC452, which carries a chromosomal deletion for the amidase locus(28Day M. Genetic Studies with Pseudomonas aeruginosa Strains, Ph.D. thesis, University of London. 1975; Google Scholar). Soluble and insoluble fractions were prepared from PAC452 pRW303 after growth under noninducing and inducing conditions (3 mM IPTG). The samples were analyzed for AmiB over-expression by SDS-PAGE, and the results are shown in Fig. 8A. The soluble fractions (lanes2 and 3) show no evidence of AmiB in either noninduced or induced samples. However, clear overexpression of a band with a calculated molecular weight of 40 kDa is seen in the insoluble induced sample (lane5). This molecular weight agrees closely with the expected molecular weight for AmiB from the nucleotide sequence (42 kDa). Thus in P. aeruginosa, AmiB appears to aggregate when overexpressed. To circumvent the problems of protein refolding and purification, the amiB gene was subcloned into the protein fusion expression vector pMALCR1 to create a MBP-AmiB fusion. The fusion protein was overexpressed in E. coli JM109 following IPTG induction and purified by amylose affinity chromatography. The affinity purification of MBP-AmiB results in fusion protein substantially free of contaminants as shown in Fig. 8B. The fusion protein showed less tendency to form insoluble aggregates than AmiB. However, gel filtration chromatography of the amylose-purified fusion indicates that a significant proportion of the purified protein forms soluble aggregates of high molecular weight, which elute shortly after the void volume on a Superdex 200 column (separation range, 600-10 kDa) and only a small proportion of the fusion is monomeric (Fig. 8, C and D). The fusion protein contains a Factor Xa cleavage site between the MBP and AmiB. However, cleavage of the fusion with Factor Xa led to rapid aggregation and precipitation of the AmiB protein, and thus it was not possible to generate soluble stable native AmiB by this route. Consequently enzymatic analysis of the AmiB protein was carried out using the purified fusion protein. The ATP binding motif (23Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar) within AmiB and the proposed structural homology with adenylate kinase suggested that AmiB may be capable of ATP hydrolysis. To test this hypothesis, ATPase assays were carried out using the purified MBP-AmiB fusion, and the results of such an assay are shown in Fig. 9 together with an assay for GTPase activity. Km and Vmax determinations were carried out using hyperbolic regression analysis, and the values for ATP were: Km = 174 ± 15 mM; Vmax = 2.4 ± 0.1 mM/min/mg. Similar values were obtained for the monomeric and aggregated forms of MBP-AmiB. MBP-AmiB was also capable of GTP hydrolysis, although the rate was much lower than for ATP (Fig. 9), and MBP-AmiB was unable to hydrolyze CTP. To confirm that the observed ATPase activity was not due to the maltose binding protein nor any E. coli contaminant, ATPase assays were also carried with an affinity-purified MBP-KorB fusion, KorB is a DNA binding protein (31Tai J.T. Cohen S.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) that has no ATPase activity. This fusion displayed no activity in the assay, confirming that the observed ATPase activity was due to AmiB and not MBP nor any of the minor contaminants observable by SDS-PAGE. The ability of various metal ions to replace magnesium in the ATPase assays was investigated (Fig. 10). In the absence of any added metal in the assay buffer, AmiB showed little residual ATPase activity. Addition of magnesium strongly stimulated the ATPase activity; however, the stimulation of activity decreased at higher magnesium concentrations. Manganese was able to substitute for magnesium, but it only gave 60% of the magnesium-ATP hydrolysis rate. Zinc and calcium-ATP could not replace magnesium as substrates for MBP-AmiB. These findings are in contrast to results obtained with other ATPases for example most F-type ATPases, which hydrolyze ATP in the presence of any one of the above divalent cations(32Kagawa Y. Sone N. Hirata H. Yoshida M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1979; 11: 39-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of MBP-AmiB was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of ADP, and the results are shown in Fig. 11a. ADP strongly inhibits the ATPase activity with up to 50% inhibition at concentrations as low as 0.2 mM with an ATP concentration of 1 mM in the assay. It seems most likely that this inhibition occurs by competition for the substrate binding site(s). Similarly, nanomolar concentrations of ammonium vanadate, which forms a pentacovalent bypyramidal structure like that of a phosphate ester undergoing hydrolysis, inhibit the ATPase activity of MBP-AmiB. From a transcriptional analysis of the amidase system2 it is evident that amiB and amiS are specifically transcribed in response to inducing amides such as acetamide in the growth medium. In addition, the amidase operon does not encode any other proteins since the full-length operon transcript is only 5.0 kb, sufficient to encode amiEBCRS.2 Earlier studies have shown that a normal amide-inducible phenotype can be reconstructed in E. coli with only the amiE, amiC, and amiR genes(5Wilson S.A. Wachira S.J. Drew R.E. Jones D. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3637-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, in this study we have shown that a 423-base pair deletion in amiB has no effect on amide-inducible amidase expression in P. aeruginosa. Thus amiB and amiS are unlikely to have a regulatory role in amidase expression. AmiB shows significant homology to the Clp family of proteins, although it is only half the size of the rest of this family. The ClpA protein with which AmiB shows high homology is the ATP binding subunit of a two-component protease complex known as Ti or the Clp protease(33Gottesman S. Clark W.P. Maurizi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7886-7893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since there is no corresponding proteolytic subunit within the amidase operon, necessary for a Clp type function, it seems unlikely that AmiB is the ATP binding subunit of a Clp type protease. HSP104, a Clp family member, has been shown to have a chaperone type function, being able to refold heat-denatured proteins(34Parsell D.A. Kowel A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). We cannot exclude such a function for AmiB. However, the much reduced size of AmiB compared with HSP104 and the unlikely requirement for an acetamide induced chaperone suggest that AmiB performs a different function within P. aeruginosa. AmiS clearly shows the characteristics of an integral membrane protein, with hydrophobic segments of membrane spanning length, interspersed by hydrophillic loop regions. An obvious role for AmiS would be as a transport protein within the plasma membrane. The homology between AmiS, the M. smegmatis ORF, and the ureI gene from H. pylori is interesting since all three operons are involved in amide utilization, suggesting they may be amide transporters. A chromosomal knockout of the ureI gene in H. pylori renders the system urease negative(35Ferrero R.L. Cussac V. Courcoux P. Labigne A. Ital. J. Gastroenterol. 1991; 23 (Suppl. 2): 3Google Scholar). This mutation had no effect with the cloned genes in E. coli, therefore UreI is not thought to be involved in enzyme regulation/synthesis. Instead, the urease negative phenotype observed in H. pylori could be due to the inability of urea to enter the cell and induce urease expression. The urease positive phenotype observed with the ureI mutant in E. coli may reflect membrane permeability differences between E. coli and H. pylori. Taken together, the AmiS and AmiB proteins resemble two components of an ABC type transporter system. Such transport systems are found in many organisms and have a basic anatomy in common (for review, see (36Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3384) Google Scholar)). Exporters/importers comprise either a single polypeptide chain with two domains, an integral membrane domain with six to eight transmembrane helices, and a cytoplasmic domain with an ATP binding motif and in some cases ATPase activity. Alternatively the domains can function as two distinct polypeptide chains. Often there are two homologous copies of the integral membrane protein, for example MalF and MalG in the maltose regulon of E. coli, and typically they have six to eight membrane-spanning regions.(37Dassa E. Hofnung M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2287-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Together these proteins form a tetrameric complex with two copies of the cytoplasmic ATP binding protein. In addition, bacterial importers often have a third protein that is located in the periplasm and binds and delivers the ligand to the integral membrane protein complex. In the amidase operon, AmiS would represent the integral membrane component of an ABC type transporter and AmiB would represent the cytoplasmic ATP binding component. The threading analysis indicated that AmiB was structurally homologous to adenylate kinase, and it has been suggested previously that the ATP binding components of ABC transporters share structural homology with adenylate kinase(38Mimura C.S. Holbrook S.R. Ames G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1991; 88: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). AmiB has been shown to have an intrinsic ATPase and GTPase activity, which is sensitive to ADP and vanadate inhibition. MalK, the E. coli maltose operon ABC transporter counterpart, shows an intrinsic ATPase activity similar to that of AmiB (Km = 70 mM; Vmax = 1.3 mmol/min/mg). In addition, MalK can also hydrolyze GTP but CTP acts as a very poor substrate. The MalK ATPase is similarly inhibited by ADP, but it is resistant to vanadate inhibition(39Morbach S. Tebbe S. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18617-18621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mammalian ABC transporter P-glycoprotein shows sensitivity to vanadate(40Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When MalK is purified as part of a complex with the integral membrane proteins, ATPase activity is only seen in the presence of ligand-loaded maltose binding protein(41Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By comparison with the maltose uptake system, it may be that AmiS modulates the activity of the AmiB ATPase in response to amides. With regard to the strong inhibition of AmiB ATPase activity by ADP and the relationship between AmiB and adenylate kinase, the possibility of ATP/ADP exchange cannot be excluded at this stage, although it is most likely that ADP is acting as a competitive inhibitor. If AmiB and AmiS form an ABC type importer complex for aliphatic amides, then they would be expected to be associated with a periplasmic binding protein. We have not identified a protein that could fulfill such a role in the amidase operon. However, the recently solved crystal structure of the AmiC protein (7Pearl L.H. O'Hara B.P. Drew R.E. Wilson S.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5810-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) shows that although cytoplasmic, it is structurally highly homologous to LivJ of E. coli despite only 17% sequence identity. This raises the possibility that AmiC has switched roles during evolution from being an amide receptor in a transport system, to a cytoplasmic regulator of gene expression, retaining an amide receptor function. We have used a strain of P. aeruginosa carrying an amiB deletion to investigate the role of amiB on acetamide-dependent growth in minimal medium, but we have failed to observe any differences in growth rate between the mutant and wild-type. A possible explanation for this may be that at the acetamide concentrations (millimolar) used to support growth in batch culture, in a reasonable period of time, the diffusion of acetamide into the cell was efficient enough to support growth. Alternatively, the intact AmiS protein may have AmiB-independent amide transport capabilities. Therefore, the effects of deletions in AmiB or AmiS may only be detectable in continuous culture where very low concentrations of amides can be used and very slow growth rates monitored. Given the hypothesis that AmiB and AmiS work as an ABC type complex in amide transport, then the identification of an AmiB homolog in the R. erythropolis operon would suggest that this amidase operon should also possess an amiS gene. Such an amiS homolog has recently been identified in this operon upstream of the amidase structural gene. 3H. Choubrier, personal communication. Similarly, we would expect to see amiB homologs in the M. smegmatis amidase operon once the sequence of this operon is completed. Within the H. pylori urease operon, we have not identified an AmiB homolog, although the ureG gene does possess an ATP binding motif (30Cussac V. Ferrero R. Labigne A.F. J. Bacteriology. 1992; 174: 2466-2473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may represent an evolutionarily divergent form of AmiB. It is interesting to note that no candidate periplasmic binding protein gene has been identified in any of these operons. It thus remains a possibility that AmiB/AmiS type systems, identified here in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, may not require a periplasmic binding protein and as such would represent a distinct and novel subfamily of ABC transporters. Current experiments aimed at expression and purification of AmiS and the generation of amiS chromosomal mutations are expected to shed more light on these unusual proteins.

A basic question is what physiological roles IGF-IR plays in living cells. IGF-I produces a variety of cellular responses, both mitogenic and metabolic. Which action of IGF-I is mediated by IGF-IR is, however, less defined. This is mainly because IGF-I also acts on IR, which mediates similar cellular responses(11Steele-Perkins G. Turner J. Edman J.C. Hari J. Pierce S.B. Stover C. Rutter W.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11486-11492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another question is how the differences in the cellular outputs between IGF-IR and IR are created in vivo. IGF-I and insulin preferentially activate mitogenesis and metabolism via IGF-IR and IR, respectively(1Humbel R.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 445-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these two receptors are highly homologous structurally and biochemically(1Humbel R.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 445-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The downstream pathways of IGF-IR so far clarified are all shared by IR(11Steele-Perkins G. Turner J. Edman J.C. Hari J. Pierce S.B. Stover C. Rutter W.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11486-11492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it remains unknown if each receptor has its unique signaling pathway or if such differences result from the different activation profiles of the same downstream pathways. To address these questions, it is necessary to turn on IGF-IR selectively. One of the best ways is to construct and use a constitutively active mutant of IGF-IR. The expression of such an autoactive mutant allows the precise analysis of the downstream pathways and functional roles of IGF-IR. There are mutants of growth factor receptors whose tyrosine kinase activities are constitutively turned on in the absence of their ligands(12Bargmann C.I. Hung M.C. Weinberg R.A.

In the present study, based on analogy with mutation-dependent activation of these receptors, we have constructed mutant IGF-IRs by substituting Glu or Ile for the transmembrane Val922 residue and have found that the former mutant retains increased tyrosine kinase activity and constitutively and differentially activates the downstream cascade of IGF-IR. Differential roles of IGF-IR signaling pathways in biological outputs are also discussed by comparing the metabolic and mitogenic effects of this activated mutant to its intracellular signals. An EcoRI fragment of human IGF-IR cDNA containing a complete open reading frame was subcloned into pUC19. The mutagenized cDNAs were generated by the unique site elimination method (Pharmacia Biotech) using a selection primer in which an original SspI site was replaced with an EcoRV site (5′-CTTCCTTTTTCGATATCATT GAAGCATTT-3′: an EcoRV site is underlined). The sequences of mutagenic target primers were 5′-GTACAGCATAATGATCAACCCTCC-3′ for V922I IGF-IR and 5′-GTACAGCATAATCTCCAACCCTCC-3′ for V922E IGF-IR (the codon for Val922 is underlined). These mutations were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and IGF-IR cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA1. COS-7 and SV40-infected BALB c/3T3 cells (SV40-BALB cells, ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% calf serum. CHO cells were grown in Ham F-12 plus 10% FCS. The antibodies used were: αIR3, monoclonal antibody against human IGF-IR (Oncogene Science); 1D6, monoclonal antibody against rat IRS-1(16Yonezawa K. Ando A. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kitamura T.

Transient transfection was performed by the lipofection method (10 μg of either WT, V922E, or V922I IGF-IR cDNA and 20 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.)) as described(17Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Murayama Y. Okamoto T. Homma Y. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31955-31961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were treated with or without IGF-I for 5 min at 37°C. For stable expression of IGF-IRs, CHO cells were transfected by the lipofection method using 1 μg of pSV2neo and 10 μg of WT or mutant IGF-IR cDNA. Cells were split the next day at 1:10, plated in Ham F-12 plus 10% FCS, and, 2 days later, were selected with 450 μg/ml G418. After 2-3 weeks, colonies were picked and tested for 125I-IGF-I binding as described(11Steele-Perkins G. Turner J. Edman J.C. Hari J. Pierce S.B. Stover C. Rutter W.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11486-11492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The colonies with high binding levels were further subcloned by limiting dilution. Cells overexpressing WT, V922E, or V922I IGF-IR were designated as CHO-IGF-IR, CHO-V922E, or CHO-V922I, respectively. For immunoprecipitation, cells were starved in Ham F-12 for 24 h at 37°C and treated with IGF-I at 37°C. Cells were lysed and precipitated with mouse IgG (Cappel), αIR3, or 1D6, as described (18Endemann G. Yonezawa K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 396-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride sheet, probed with RC20H or anti-IRS-1 antibody/horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and detected by ECL. For labeling studies, 45 h post-transfection cells were incubated with Met- and Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing [35S]Met and [35S]Cys (0.1 mCi/ml) with 10% dialyzed FCS for 3 h at 37°C. Cells were then incubated with IGF-I for 5 min and analyzed as described(19Yonezawa K. Ueda H. Hara K. Nishida K. Ando A. Chavanieu A. Matsuba H. Shii K. Yokono K. Fukui Y. Calas B. Grigorescu F.

The IGF-IR kinase activity was measured using Poly(Glu, Tyr) 4:1 (Sigma) as described(18Endemann G. Yonezawa K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 396-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bands of poly(Glu, Tyr) and IGF-IR β subunit were excised and quantitated by Cerenkov counting. The PI 3-kinase activity was measured directly in 1D6 precipitates in a reaction mixture as described(18Endemann G. Yonezawa K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 396-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-I-stimulated 2-deoxy-D-[1,2-3H]glucose uptake (20Kozka I.J. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11726-11731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and [3H]methylthymidine incorporation (21Zhang B. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18320-18328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were measured as described. The cell proliferation assay using XTT (Boehringer Mannheim) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis of Ras-bound guanine nucleotides was performed as described(16Yonezawa K. Ando A. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kitamura T. Nakafuku M. Hara K. Okabayashi Y. Kadowaki T. Kaziro Y. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4634-4640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MAP kinase activity was measured by immune-complex kinase assay in anti-ERK1 immunoprecipitates and in-gel kinase assay using cell lysates. ERK1 was precipitated with anti-ERK1 rabbit sera (1:25 dilution), and its activity was measured using myelin basic protein (MBP) as described (22de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Burgering B.M.T. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Bos J.L. Nature. 1992; 357: 602-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In-gel kinase assay was performed using MBP as described(23Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). All radioisotopes were purchased from DuPont NEN. All experiments were reproduced at least three times (only in immune-complex MAP kinase assay, experiments were independently repeated twice). We first examined in vitro kinase activity of Val922 mutants using an exogenous substrate. IGF-IRs transiently expressed in COS-7 cells treated with or without 100 nM IGF-I were precipitated with αIR3. Tyrosine kinase activity was assessed by measuring incorporation of radioactivity into poly(Glu, Tyr) 4:1. As shown in Fig. 1A, poly(Glu, Tyr) phosphorylation markedly increased in the IGF-I-untreated precipitate of V922E IGF-IR but not in that of WT or V922I IGF-IR. Notably, the same figure shows that autophosphorylation of the 95-kDa β subunit of IGF-IR (as well as the 200-kDa IGF-IR precursor) also increased in V922E IGF-IR but not in WT or V922I IGF-IR, verifying the augmented in vitro kinase activity of V922E IGF-IR. Expression levels of IGF-IRs were assumed to be similar in these experiments, as the levels of tyrosine kinase activities maximally stimulated by IGF-I were similar (Fig. 1A). This was confirmed by parallel experiments, in which COS-7 cells transfected with mutant IGF-IR cDNAs were metabolically labeled. Proteins of 200, 135, and 95 kDa, corresponding to the precursor, α, and β subunits of IGF-IR, respectively, were precipitated by αIR3 from these transfected COS-7 cells in similar amounts (Fig. 1B). We also examined autophosphorylation of the β subunit of V922E IGF-IR using a different method, which represents in vivo tyrosine kinase activity of this mutant. IGF-IRs transiently expressed in COS-7 cells were precipitated by αIR3 and immunoblotted with anti-Tyr(P) antibody RC20H. Constitutively augmented β-subunit autophosphorylation of V922E IGF-IR, but not WT or V922I was observed (Fig. 1C). We next examined IRS-1 phosphorylation by the V922E mutant in intact cells. As 1D6 recognizes rodent IRS-1 but not monkey IRS-1, we used SV40-BALB cells instead of COS-7 for this experiment with transient transfection. Without IGF-I treatment, 1D6 precipitated IRS-1 with enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 from SV40-BALB cells transfected with V922E IGF-IR cDNA (Fig. 1D). This was not observed in the parallel transfection with WT or V922I cDNA. In an effort to confirm these results obtained from transient expression, we established CHO cell lines overexpressing IGF-IR mutants. CHO-IGF-IR, CHO-V922E (Clones 1 and 2), or CHO-V922I cells specifically bound 3.7 to 4.1 times more 125I-IGF-I as compared to the parental CHO cells. The expressed WT and mutant IGF-IRs had apparent Kd values of 1.3 to 2.7 × 10−9M for IGF-I (Fig. 2A). The Kd value of native IGF-IR in parental CHO cells was 1.0 × 10−9M. Therefore, the stable CHO cell lines did overexpress IGF-IRs with comparable affinities for IGF-I. We also assessed the amount of IRS-1 in the stable CHO cell lines, as it has been reported that a CHO cell line overexpressing a mutant IR retains reduced amounts of IRS-1(24Cheatham B. Shoelson S.E. Yamada K. Goncalves E. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7336-7340Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The lysates of CHO-IGF-IR, CHO-V922E (Clones 1 and 2), or CHO-V922I were precipitated with 1D6 and blotted with anti-IRS-1 antibody. The results clearly indicated that the amounts of IRS-1 were similar among these cell lines (Fig. 2B). From stable CHO cell lines, we immunoprecipitated both IGF-IRs and IRS-1 and detected them with anti-Tyr(P) antibody immunoblotting. In the absence of IGF-I, augmented autophosphorylation of the IGF-IR β subunit was observed in CHO-V922E (Clones 1 and 2) but not in CHO-IGF-IR or CHO-V922I (Fig. 2C). Besides, tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was stimulated in the absence of IGF-I in CHO-V922E (Clones 1 and 2) but not in CHO-IGF-IR or CHO-V922I (Fig. 2D). The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of both IGF-IR β subunit and IRS-1 maximally activated by 10 nM IGF-I were similar among these cell lines. As the established target of IRS-1 activated by IGF-IR is PI 3-kinase, we measured IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity in CHO-V922E cells. By precipitating IRS-1 from lysates of CHO-V922E cells, the PI 3-kinase activity was found to be significantly elevated in these cells (Fig. 3A). We quantitated the PI 3-kinase-stimulating effect of V922E IGF-IR by comparing it with those effects of various concentrations of IGF-I in CHO-IGF-IR. The effect of V922E IGF-IR on PI 3-kinase was virtually equivalent to that of 1 nM IGF-I in CHO-IGF-IR (Fig. 3A). This was also the case when the effect was assessed by tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Fig. 3B). Thus, V922E mutation turns on the IGF-IR signal as strongly as does 1 nM IGF-I stimulation of WT IGF-IR. Thus, it is shown that V922E IGF-IR has autoactive intrinsic tyrosine kinase, and this causes constitutive activation of the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase cascade. Next, we investigated biological outputs of this mutant by examining metabolic and mitogenic stimulation. In CHO-IGF-IR cells, exposure to IGF-I (20 min) resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of the uptake of radiolabeled 2-deoxyglucose (Fig. 4A). CHO-V922E cells (Clone 1) exhibited significantly elevated basal uptake of glucose, as strongly as did 0.1 nM IGF-I stimulation in CHO-IGF-IR cells. As for mitogenic stimulation, thymidine uptake assay and cell proliferation assay with XTT were performed. Very interestingly, in clear contrast to glucose uptake, CHO-V922E cells (Clone 1) showed no basal elevation in thymidine uptake and XTT values and exhibited IGF-I-dependent stimulation similar to that observed in CHO-IGF-IR with both assays (Fig. 4, B and C). Similarly, Clone 2 of CHO-V922E cells also showed basal elevation of glucose uptake but not of cell proliferation assays (data not shown). Finally, we made an effort to address the question of why this autoactive IGF-IR mutant fails to stimulate cellular mitogenesis. Since the Ras-MAP kinase pathway has been implicated in tyrosine kinase-induced mitogenesis(22de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Burgering B.M.T. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Bos J.L.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), we focused on this pathway and examined both Ras activation and MAP kinase activation in CHO-V922E cells. The former assay clearly showed that no basal elevation was observed in the Ras-GTP amount, while IGF-I treatment stimulated the Ras activity in CHO-V922E cells to an extent similar to that observed in CHO-IGF-IR (Fig. 5A). Activities of MAP kinases were measured by immune-complex kinase assay of ERK1 (Fig. 5B) and in-gel kinase assay of ERKs 1 and 2 (Fig. 5C). Again, CHO-V922E cells showed no basal elevation in the MAP kinase activities, and IGF-I-dependent stimulation of MAP kinases was similar between CHO-V922E and CHO-IGF-IR cells. These data clearly indicate that the V922E mutant fails to activate the Ras-MAP kinase cascade in CHO cells in the absence of IGF-I. The activation failure in this pathway provides a reasonable explanation for the failure of constitutive mitogenic stimulation by the V922E mutant. We have herein shown that the transmembrane V922E mutation turns on the tyrosine kinase activity of IGF-IR. As the substitution of the same Val922 to Ile does not turn on the kinase activity, V922E should specifically act on the receptor conformation and switch on the intrinsic tyrosine kinase. The results also show that the V922E mutant causes phosphorylation of IRS-1 and stimulation of the IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity. Thus, V922E IGF-IR can turn on the consecutive downstream pathway of IGF-IR in intact cells. Mediation by IR of the action of V922E IGF-IR is less likely, because BALB/c 3T3 cells, in which this mutant can transmit the signal to IRS-1, lack detectable amounts of IR(29Kojima I. Matsunaga H. Kurokawa K. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16561-16567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four examples of autoactive receptor tyrosine kinases by point mutations have so far been reported: oncogenic Neu with V664E(12Bargmann C.I. Hung M.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1986; 45: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar), IR with V938D(14Longo N. Shuster R.C. Griffin L.D. Langley S.D. Elsas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12416-12419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), c-Kit with V560G or D814V(15Furitsu T. Tsujimura T. Tono T. Ikeda H. Kitayama H. Koshimizu U. Sugahara H. Butterfield J.H. Ashman L.K. Kanayama Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kitamura Y. Kanakura Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1736-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), and CSF-1 receptor/c-Fms with L301S or Y969F(13Roussel M.F. Downing J.R. Ettenmier C.W. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1988; 55: 979-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although these mutants were shown to carry augmented tyrosine kinase activity, it has been less defined whether their downstream pathways are biochemically activated in intact cells. For the first time, this study thus shows that mutationally activated receptor tyrosine kinase turns on the downstream consecutive signaling cascade, like ligand-dependent activation. V922E submaximally activated IGF-IR as compared to the maximal stimulation by IGF-I. The effects of V922E IGF-IR on IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase were equivalent to those of 1 nM IGF-I. As 1 nM is a concentration at which IGF-I can exert its physiological functions, this mutant should generate physiologically significant outputs of cells. Submaximal activation by V922E IGF-IR may reflect that a partial population of this mutant is activated, with each mutant being completely turned on. Alternatively, each molecule of V922E mutant may be in partially activated conformation, with all the population of this mutant being in such a half-activated state. IGF-IR has pleiotropic outputs of cells, both mitogenic and metabolic. Recent studies prove that this receptor serves a wider range of biological roles than previously thought(30Kozma L.M. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 31Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 825-831PubMed Google Scholar). Also, IGF-IR has multiple sets of different downstream signaling pathways. However, little has been known about the role that each pathway plays for the cellular outputs of IGF-IR. This study clearly showed that V922E IGF-IR stimulated glucose uptake in the absence of IGF-I in CHO cells. It was also shown that V922E IGF-IR constitutively activated the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase pathway in the same cells. These data strongly suggest a close relationship between the PI 3-kinase stimulation and cellular response of glucose uptake. Accumulated evidence (35Okada T. Kawano T. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R.

Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar) has so far indicated that PI 3-kinase mediates glucose uptake stimulated by insulin. Our results are thus consistent with this notion. Further analysis of the dose-response relationship revealed that glucose uptake stimulation by V922E IGF-IR was 0.1 nM IGF-I-equivalent in expressing CHO cells. Given that PI 3-kinase activation by this mutant was 1 nM IGF-I-equivalent in the same cells, this suggests that other IGF-I-dependent machinery may potentiate PI 3-kinase-mediated glucose uptake and allow its optimal activation by IGF-I stimulation. This study also indicated that V922E IGF-IR failed to promote mitogenesis in the absence of IGF-I. Does this signify that mitogenesis is not a physiological output of IGF-IR? We believe that mitogenesis is certainly the native output of this receptor and assumed that the V922E mutant could not turn on the native IGF-IR-responsive set of intracellular signals necessary for cell growth in the absence of IGF-I. This idea was verified by the results obtained from multiple independent assays all showing that V922E mutant could not activate the Ras-MAP kinase pathway, which is thought to be required for mitogenesis by receptor tyrosine kinases(22de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Burgering B.M.T. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Bos J.L. Nature. 1992; 357: 602-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 25Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Brugge J.S.

These data thus demonstrate that a transmembrane point mutation differentially turns on the downstream signaling pathways of IGF-IR. The mechanism for such differential activation of signals seems to be related to the partial tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by V922E mutant (see above). A simple interpretation of these data is that V922E-induced conformational change of IGF-IR allows its intrinsic tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate the PI 3-kinase-binding tyrosine on IRS-1 but not some of other sites on IRS-1. Alternatively, it might be related to differential phosphorylation of other IGF-IR kinase substrates such as Shc(38Giorgetti S. Pelicci P.G. Pelicci G. Van Obberghen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We must thus await precise analysis of V922E-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation sites of IRS-1 and comprehensive investigation of all possible IGF-IR downstream pathways turned on by this mutation. The differential activation of the two downstream pathways by V922E IGF-IR also suggests that the physiological level of activation of PI 3-kinase does not lead to the activation of the Ras-MAP kinase cascade, signifying that PI 3-kinase may not be the native upstream machinery of the Ras system. This is consistent with multiple reports using the same CHO cells showing that a dominant negative mutant of p85, the adaptor subunit of PI 3-kinase, inhibits insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activation but not Ras activation (36Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Dhand R. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) or a dominant negative mutant of tyrosine-specific phosphatase Syp and that of Ras guanylnucleotide exchange factor SOS both inhibit insulin-induced Ras activation but not PI 3-kinase activation(39Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 40Sakaue M. Bowtell D. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In further support of this notion, 50 nM wortmannin completely inhibits insulin stimulation of PI 3-kinase in CHO cells, whereas the same concentration of wortmannin has no effect on insulin-induced Ras activation. 2K. Takahashi, K. Yonezawa, and I. Nishimoto, unpublished observation. On the other hand, Hu et al.(41Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) have recently shown that expression of the constitutively active mutant of p110, the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, activates Ras-MAP kinase cascade in Xenopus oocytes. The discrepancy between their and our results may be attributed to the difference of cell systems studied. Alternatively, the V922E mutant activated endogenous PI 3-kinase submaximally in our experiments, whereas constitutively active PI 3-kinase has been exogenously overexpressed in their experiments. Both stimulation intensity and spatial localization of PI 3-kinases might be potentially different between these studies. It is therefore quite interesting to compare precisely the action of V922E IGF-IR with that of the activated p110 mutant using the same experimental systems.

https://openalex.org/W1494778490,"Assembly and disassembly of the nucleus at mitosis in eukaryotes involves the reversible interaction of chromatin with the nuclear membrane. Previously we have shown that this interaction is regulated by the antagonistic activities of a kinase and a phosphatase. The kinase promotes membrane release while the phosphatase stimulates binding. In this report we describe four steps in the purification of the kinase needed for release of membranes from chromatin. We also show that the release kinase and the mitotic initiation kinase, cdc2, are distinct and are separated from each other during the second purification step. Reconstitution experiments using these two kinases demonstrate that the release kinase and cdc2 kinase work in concert to cause membrane release from chromatin. In phosphorylation experiments, protein targets that are substrates for the regulatory release kinase are identified on the membranes. These phosphorylated proteins are candidates for regulated proteins mediating membrane-chromatin interaction. Finally, we find that membrane release activity can also be extracted from membranes by high salt treatment, indicating a possible dual localization of this activity. Assembly and disassembly of the nucleus at mitosis in eukaryotes involves the reversible interaction of chromatin with the nuclear membrane. Previously we have shown that this interaction is regulated by the antagonistic activities of a kinase and a phosphatase. The kinase promotes membrane release while the phosphatase stimulates binding. In this report we describe four steps in the purification of the kinase needed for release of membranes from chromatin. We also show that the release kinase and the mitotic initiation kinase, cdc2, are distinct and are separated from each other during the second purification step. Reconstitution experiments using these two kinases demonstrate that the release kinase and cdc2 kinase work in concert to cause membrane release from chromatin. In phosphorylation experiments, protein targets that are substrates for the regulatory release kinase are identified on the membranes. These phosphorylated proteins are candidates for regulated proteins mediating membrane-chromatin interaction. Finally, we find that membrane release activity can also be extracted from membranes by high salt treatment, indicating a possible dual localization of this activity. Recent progress in understanding the dynamics of the cell nucleus has come predominantly from a biochemical approach employing in vitro systems that faithfully reproduce nuclear assembly and disassembly. The most widely used among these in vitro systems employs extracts prepared from mature Xenopuslaevis eggs(1Lohka M. Masui Y.

Cell. 1985; 41: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These cytoplasmic extracts can be prepared in either a mitotic or an interphase state. Mitotic extracts promote nuclear disassembly(5Sheehan M.A. Mills A.D. Sleeman A.M. Laskey R.A. Blow J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 6Lohka M. Maller J.

Cell. 1987; 48: 219-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and interphase extracts support nuclear assembly around a DNA substrate(1Lohka M. Masui Y.

Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Concerning assembly of the nuclear envelope membrane, a binding and a fusion step of precursor membrane vesicles to the nuclear envelope membrane has been resolved. It has been shown that binding of membrane vesicles to chromatin does not require cytosol, provided the chromatin DNA is present in a partially decondensed form(9Pfaller R. Smythe C. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 209-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10Newport J. Dunphy W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 11Boman A.L. Delannoy M.R. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Using this in vitro binding assay, we have established that membrane binding to chromatin is regulated by the activities of a kinase and phosphatase system(9Pfaller R. Smythe C. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 209-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The kinase appears to phosphorylate a membrane bound component, which then inhibits association of vesicles with the chromatin. By contrast, the phosphatase appears to dephosphorylate the membrane component and promote binding of vesicles to chromatin. By modulating the relative activities of these two components in an assembly extract one can promote either vesicle-chromatin association or vesicle-chromatin dissociation. At mitosis, chromatin detaches from the nuclear envelope in all eukaryotic cells. This dissociation occurs whether the cell vesicularizes its nuclear envelope (open mitosis) or the envelope remains intact during this period of the cell cycle (closed mitosis). This suggests that the relative activities of the kinase and phosphatase regulating membrane-chromatin association change at mitosis in favor of phosphorylation. In support of this we have shown that, although the major mitotic kinase, cdc2, is unable to cause membrane-chromatin dissociation directly, it can do so when acting in concert with the regulatory kinase contained in a crude cytosolic protein fraction(9Pfaller R. Smythe C. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 209-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the partial purification of the membrane release activity. Starting from mitotic Xenopus cytosol, four steps of purification are described. The first column of the purification protocol, DEAE sepharose, led to a separation of all three regulatory activities, with cdc2 kinase eluting first, followed by the regulatory phosphatase and the regulatory kinase (measured as membrane release activity). The purest protein fraction containing membrane release activity also contained kinase activity phosphorylating a distinct set of membrane-associated proteins. Concerning the regulatory phosphatase, an assay was developed for purification of this activity. We also found that membrane release activity could be extracted from membranes by high salt treatment, indicating a possible dual localization of this regulatory enzyme, consistent with its proposed function. This is also supported by the observation that the kinase isolated from cytosol and the membrane-associated kinase phosphorylated a similar set of membrane proteins. Published procedures were used to obtain interphase extracts (3Newport J.W. Cell. 1987; 48: 205-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 8Wilson K.L. Newport J.W. J.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2047-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) from mature, unfertilized Xenopus eggs. Cytosol and membrane fractions were obtained from crude egg extracts by ultracentrifugation (1 h at 55,000 rpm, Beckman TLS-55 rotor) as described previously(9Pfaller R. Smythe C. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 209-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mitotic cytosol for purification of membrane release activity was prepared the following way. After ultracentrifugation of crude mitotic egg extract, the resulting cytosol layer together with the membrane layer were separated from a bottom pellet consisting predominantly of glycogen and residual cellular debris. ATPγS 1The abbreviations used are: ATPγSadenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateDMAP6,6′-dimethyl aminopurine. (Boehringer Mannheim) was added (0.5 mM final concentration), and aliquots of the membrane-cytosol mixture (1-ml volume) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until use. adenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate 6,6′-dimethyl aminopurine. Mitotic cytosol-membrane fraction from several preparations was thawed and pooled to give a total volume of 25 ml. 25 ml of EB buffer (80 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 20 mM EGTA, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol), 50 ml of 0.5 mM microcystin LR (Calbiochem; 0.5 mM final concentration), and 250 ml of 50 mM ATPγS (to give a total final concentration of 0.5 mM) were added, and the membrane fraction was separated from the cytosol fraction by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g in a Beckman SW 41 rotor. The cytosol fraction was used for ammonium sulfate precipitation while the membrane pellet was resuspended in egg lysis buffer (250 mM sucrose, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. Ammonium sulfate precipitation of mitotic cytosol was essentially carried out as described for the partial purification of maturation-promoting factor(12Dunphy W.G. Newport J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2047-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Wu M. Gerhart J.G. Dev. Biol. 1980; 79: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The volume of mitotic cytosol was adjusted to 50 ml with EB buffer, and 25 ml of 3.6 M ammonium sulfate, dissolved in EB, was added dropwise with frequent mixing (1.2 M final concentration). After incubation for 30 min on ice, precipitated protein was recovered by centrifugation (Sorvall HB-4 rotor, 10 min at 10,000 rpm). All chromatographic procedures described in the following sections were carried out using fast protein liquid chromatography (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in the cold room. The ammonium sulfate precipitate was dissolved in 10 ml of EB buffer, 0.5 mM ATPγS, and 0.5 mM microcystin LR. 30 ml of 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, was added, and nondissolved material was removed by centrifugation (clinical centrifuge). The supernatant was applied, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, to a DEAE-Sepharose column (Pharmacia, 0.8 × 16 cm), equilibrated in buffer A (20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5). The column was washed, at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, with buffer A, and protein was eluted, at the same flow rate, with a 300-ml linear gradient (0-0.5 M NaCl) in buffer A. Fractions of 6-ml volume were collected, frozen, and kept at −70°C. Membrane release activity eluted between 300-400 mM NaCl. Active fractions from the DEAE column were pooled (total volume, 48 ml), microcystin LR was added (0.5 mM final concentration), and the pool was divided in half, both of which were run over a Mono Q column (Pharmacia) under identical conditions. 24 ml of DEAE pool was diluted with 26 ml of buffer A and, using a 50-ml super loop (Pharmacia), loaded onto a Mono Q column (Pharmacia; flow rate 1 ml/min, equilibrated in buffer A, 0.1 M NaCl). The column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer, and protein was eluted, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, with a 25-ml linear gradient (0.2-0.5 M NaCl) in buffer A. Fractions of 1-ml volume were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. Membrane release activity eluted as a sharp peak at about 380 mM NaCl. Both Mono Q runs were combined, and 4 ml of active Mono Q fraction were recovered. 1 ml of active Mono Q fraction was diluted with 3 ml of buffer A and, using a 10-ml super loop (Pharmacia), was loaded at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min onto a heparin-Sepharose CL-2B column (Pharmacia HR 5/20, 5 × 200 mm), equilibrated in buffer A (heparin-Sepharose CL-2B was a generous gift from Jim Kadonaga, UCSD). The column was washed with 6 ml of buffer A, and protein was eluted by a two-step salt gradient, 4 ml of a gradient from 0-180 mM NaCl followed by 30 ml of a gradient from 180-600 mM NaCl, both in buffer A. 1-ml fractions were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. Membrane release activity eluted at about 480 mM NaCl. At this stage, the protein concentration of the active fraction was very low, and membrane release activity became sensitive to freezing and thawing. An assay, modified from our previously described protocol(9Pfaller R. Smythe C. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 209-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was used to measure membrane release activity. In a first step, the substrate for membrane release assays was prepared in a mix, here described for 10 assays. To 0.1 ml of egg lysis buffer, containing 2 mg of poly-L-glutamic acid/ml (Sigma), membrane vesicles (30 mg, usually from a 5 mg/ml stock), demembranated frog sperm chromatin (7,500/ml, isolated from the testes of male X. laevis frogs as described in Refs. 1 and 8), ATP (2 mM), GTPγS (0.2 mM), and aprotinin and leupeptin (100 mg/ml each) were added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Although not required, for most of the membrane release assays and all of the kinase assays (see below) membranes isolated from Xenopus egg extracts were further purified by flotation(8Wilson K.L. Newport J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of membrane suspensions (and also of fractions from the protein purification) were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 10-ml aliquots of the binding mix were added to 40 ml of protein fraction in EB buffer and 5 ml of a 10-fold concentrated ATP-regenerating mix (consisting of 0.5 mg of creatine kinase/ml, 10 mM ATP, 50 mM creatine phosphate), and, if required, okadaic acid (Moana Bioproducts) or microcystin LR (1 mM final concentration of either phosphatase inhibitor) was added. Binding of membrane vesicles to chromatin was assessed by fluorescence microscopy as described previously (9Pfaller R. Smythe C. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 209-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) using a combination of the fluorescent dyes Hoechst 33258 (DNA) and 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine (Kodak) (membranes). In the very early stages of purification we realized that binding of membrane vesicles to chromatin was strongly ionic strength-dependent, and salt concentrations above 120 mM NaCl reduced dissociation of membranes from chromatin. To avoid ambiguous results due to differences in NaCl concentrations, all protein fractions assayed for membrane release were dialyzed against 100 volumes of EB buffer for 3 h prior to use. Based on our previous observation(9Pfaller R. Smythe C. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 209-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), in a first step, membranes isolated from Xenopus interphase extracts were inactivated for chromatin binding by incubating 3 ml of membrane stock for 30 min at room temperature in 30 ml of interphase cytosol, containing an ATP-regenerating system, 2 mM GTPγS, and 2.5 mM microcystin LR. The incubation mixture was then layered on top of 50 ml of egg lysis buffer containing 0.5 M sucrose, the membranes were reisolated by centrifugation (Eppendorf centrifuge, 15 min at 4°C), and the membrane pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer. In parallel, a mix was prepared consisting of 0.1 ml of EB buffer containing 2 mg of poly L-glutamic acid/ml, 1 mM ATP, and demembranated frog sperm chromatin (7,500 sperm/ml). After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, 15 ml of pretreated membranes were added, and 20-ml aliquots of the resulting mix combined with 20 ml of phosphatase-containing protein fraction (dialyzed into EB buffer as described above). Aliquots of the samples were assessed for restoration of membrane binding to chromatin by fluorescence microscopy as described above. In control samples, microcystin LR was added (2 mM final concentration) to inhibit phosphatase activity. Protein fractions to be assayed for kinase activity were adjusted to a final volume of 10 ml using EB and 10 ml of a mix was added containing 0.4 mM ATP, 2 mM microcystin LR, 5-10 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN), and, if not otherwise indicated, 0.5 mg of membranes isolated from Xenopus egg extracts (further purified by flotation; see membrane release assay). Samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and diluted with 200 ml of EB buffer, and membranes were reisolated by centrifugation (Eppendorf centrifuge; 12 min at 4°C). The membrane pellets were dissolved in SDS-containing sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) and autoradiography of the dried gels. If phosphorylation of the total sample was analyzed, 7 ml of 4-fold concentrated SDS-containing sample buffer was added to stop the kinase reaction. Fractions from the DEAE column were assayed for histone H1 kinase activity as described previously(9Pfaller R. Smythe C. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 209-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Dunphy W.G. Newport J.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 181-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Active fractions were pooled, and one-half of the pool (25-ml volume) was applied to a 1.5-ml column of p13-Sepharose. p13-Sepharose was prepared by coupling purified, recombinant p13 protein (15Brizuela L. Draetta G. Beach D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia) at a concentration of 10 mg of p13/ml of swollen gel, following the manufacturer's instructions. After loading, the column was washed with 20 ml of buffer A, 0.2 M NaCl followed by 15 ml of buffer B (1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 6.8). cdc2 kinase was then eluted with 2 ml of 30 mg/ml p13 in buffer B(17Labbe J.C. Capony J.P. Caput D. Cavadere J.C. Lelias J. Kaghad M. Lelias J.M. Picard A. Doree M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3050-3058Crossref Scopus (376) Google Scholar). 1-ml fractions were collected, and aliquots were assayed for histone H1 kinase activity as described(9Pfaller R. Smythe C. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 209-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Dunphy W.G. Newport J.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 181-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Active fractions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C. A pool of 1.8 ml of membrane suspension, derived from several preparations of interphase extract by ultracentrifugation of the crude extract (approximately 18-ml volume), were diluted with EB buffer to a final volume of 10 ml. Aprotinin and leupeptin were added (10 mg/ml final concentration), and the membranes were reisolated by centrifugation in a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor (1 h, 50,000 rpm). The volume of the firm membrane pellet was determined to be 0.75 ml. It was suspended in a total volume of 1 ml (by adding EB), and then 1 ml of 3-fold concentrated EB, 1 ml of 3 M KCl (1 M final concentration), 1 mM ATP, aprotinin, and leupeptin (20 mg/ml final concentration each) were added. The membranes were thoroughly suspended and kept at room temperature for 15 min followed by centrifugation in a TLA-100.3 rotor (1 h at 60,000 rpm). The supernatant (2.2-ml volume) was dialyzed against 250 ml of EB for 3 h with one change of the dialysis buffer after 1 h. Aliquots of the salt extract were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −70°C. Mature X. laevis eggs can be fractionated by centrifugation. Independent membrane and cytosol fractions can be obtained from such a fractionation, which together will support assembly of a functionally and morphologically intact nuclear envelope around a chromatin substrate in vitro(3Newport J.W. Cell. 1987; 48: 205-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 8Wilson K.L. Newport J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Modification of this system has opened the way to study the specific binding of membrane vesicles on the chromatin surface (9Pfaller R. Smythe C. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 209-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10Newport J. Dunphy W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 16Vigers G.P.A. Lohka M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and their subsequent fusion to form the double membrane of the nuclear envelope (10Newport J. Dunphy W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 11Boman A.L. Delannoy M.R. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We have previously characterized an experimental system to study the binding of membrane vesicles to demembranated Xenopus sperm chromatin in the absence of cytosolic components(9Pfaller R. Smythe C. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 209-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this system, washed membrane vesicles, isolated from X. laevis eggs, are incubated with demembranated frog sperm chromatin in the presence of poly-L-glutamic acid. Under these conditions, the initially highly condensed sperm DNA becomes decondensed and then readily binds the purified membrane vesicles. The binding of membrane vesicles to chromatin can be easily visualized by fluorescence microscopy using dyes specific for either DNA or membranes. Using this membrane-chromatin complex as a substrate, we have developed an assay for measuring the activity of the regulatory kinase contained in Xenopus egg cytosol. When interphase cytosol is added to this substrate, release of chromatin-bound membrane vesicles is observed provided that ATP and okadaic acid (an inhibitor of type 1 and 2A phosphatases) are present. Membrane release resulted in loss of fluorescent membrane stain on chromatin as assessed visually by fluorescence microscopy ((9Pfaller R. Smythe C. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 209-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and Fig. 1). We have used this assay for purification of membrane release activity from Xenopus egg cytosol. Mitotic egg cytosol was used as starting material for the purification because it was apparent from our previous investigations that membrane release activity is markedly enhanced in mitotic extracts relative to interphase extracts(9Pfaller R. Smythe C. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 209-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10Newport J. Dunphy W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In mitosis, the membrane-chromatin binding equilibrium is reversibly altered in favor of membrane release possibly due to mitotic stimulation of the regulatory kinase by cdc2 kinase. So far, we have established four purification steps for the release kinase including ammonium sulfate precipitation, chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, Mono Q, and heparin-Sepharose (see Table1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Fractionation of mitotic Xenopus cytosol with 1.2 M (w/v) ammonium sulfate has previously been described as yielding a crude preparation of maturation-promoting factor/cdc2 kinase(12Dunphy W.G. Newport J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2047-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Dunphy W.G. Newport J.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 181-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 18Wu M. Gerhart J.G. Dev. Biol. 1980; 79: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recently we found that this 1.2 M ammonium sulfate fraction also contained high membrane release activity ((9Pfaller R. Smythe C. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 209-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and Table1). When cdc2 kinase was depleted from this crude maturation-promoting factor preparation, membrane release activity was still present. However, in contrast to the undepleted ammonium sulfate fraction, it could now only be detected in the presence of okadaic acid. 2R. Pfaller and J. Newport, unpublished observations. Thus, it appears that in addition to cdc2 kinase both the regulatory kinase and the phosphatase are also contained in this 1.2 M ammonium sulfate fraction. Chromatography of the 1.2 M ammonium sulfate fraction on DEAE-Sepharose provided a means for separation of all three regulatory activities, with cdc2 kinase eluting at lowest ionic strength followed by the phosphatase (see below) and then the membrane release activity. At this point of purification the membrane release activity is partially contaminated with regulatory phosphatase since the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (or microcystin LR, a phosphatase inhibitor with similar specificity that was used in many experiments) was required to detect membrane release activity. Phosphatase activity antagonizing membrane release was no longer observed in the active fractions of the following purification step (Mono Q column), which also provided concentration of the activity. Chromatography beyond the Mono Q fraction proved to be difficult because release activity became increasingly unstable. Fig. 1 shows release activity of the peak fraction of the last purification step established to date, chromatography on heparin-Sepharose CL-2B. Membrane release using this fraction was ATP-dependent and inhibited by 6,6′-dimethyl aminopurine (DMAP), a kinase inhibitor with broad specificity. Following chromatography on a Mono Q column the protein content of fractions containing release activity was approximately 0.05% of the protein present in the starting cleared mitotic cytosol (Table1). However, the apparent purification at this stage seems rather low (40-100-fold). This low purification is largely due to the separation of cdc2 kinase, an activator of the release kinase activity, from the release kinase during DEAE chromatography. Following the separation of these two kinases the release kinase activity appears to attenuate. This attenuation in release kinase activity can be reversed by the addition of purified active cdc2 kinase (see below). Depending on the preparations used we found that the addition of purified cdc2 kinase to either the Mono Q or the heparin-Sepharose release kinase fractions increased the release activity present in these fractions 4-10-fold. If this normalization is incorporated into calculations for purification, then the purification achieved following Mono Q chromotography ranges between 160- and 400-fold. As previously demonstrated, cdc2 kinase is able to stimulate membrane release(9Pfaller R. Smythe C. Newport J.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 209-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since separation of the regulatory enzymes was not available at that time, it was not clear if stimulation of membrane release was caused by stimulation of the kinase or attenuation of the phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 2, chromatography of the 1.2 M ammonium sulfate cut on DEAE-Sepharose separated cdc2 kinase activity (assayed by phosphorylation of histone H1, one of its substrates) and membrane release activity. Accordingly, we observed a sharp drop in membrane release activity (Table1) and a concomitant dependence of membrane release on okadaic acid. To answer the question of whether cdc2 kinase stimulates membrane release activity in concert with the regulatory kinase, cdc2 kinase was further purified by affinity chromatography on p13 Sepharose (17Labbe J.C. Capony J.P. Caput D. Cavadere J.C. Lelias J. Kaghad M. Lelias J.M. Picard A. Doree M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3050-3058Crossref Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and assayed in combination with membrane release activity at the Mono Q stage. As already mentioned, at this stage of purification, regulatory kinase and phosphatase appeared to have been separated completely. The stimulatory effect of cdc2 kinase on membrane release was assayed the following way. Active Mono Q fraction was employed in the membrane release assay at a 20-fold dilution, in the absence or presence of cdc2 kinase. At this dilution, the Mono Q fraction alone failed to cause membrane release (Fig. 3, Mono Q frc., 1:20 dilution). Membrane release was restored, however, when cdc2 kinase was added (Fig. 3, Mono Q frc., 1:20 dilution, + cdc2 kinase). cdc2 kinase alone did not lead to membrane release even when present at a 2-fold higher concentration. Thus, in this particular case, membrane release activity was stimulated about 4-fold in the presence of cdc2 kinase. It should be noted that stimulation of membrane release varied considerably depending on the preparation of membrane release kinase, and stimulation up to 10-fold has been observed. The cdc2 kinase-mediated activation of membrane release in the absence of the regulatory phosphatase indicates that one pathway of stimulating membrane release in mitotic extracts is mediated by the combined effect of a regulatory kinase and cdc2 kinase. To date, neither the regulatory kinase nor its substrate(s) have been identified and, although we favor a mechanism by which stimulation of membrane release occurs in a linear fashion where cdc2 kinase stimulates the activity of the regulatory kinase, we cannot exclude the possibility that both kinases act in parallel (see “Discussion”).Figu"
https://openalex.org/W1965030380,"To investigate the role of the carboxyl terminus in the regulation of the bombesin (BN) receptor, we constructed two chimeric receptors with carboxyl termini transferred from either m3 muscarinic cholinergic (m3 ACh) (BMC) or cholecystokinin A (CCKA) (BCC) receptors and expressed them in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Previous studies showed that agonist treatment caused rapid internalization of CCKA but not m3 ACh receptors in these cells. In the current study we conducted separate analyses of ligand and receptor internalization and analyzed receptor recycling. Ligand internalization was assessed using acid washing. BN and CCKA receptors internalized ligand with 80 ± 3 and 85 ± 7% in an acid-resistant compartment at equilibrium. Ligand internalization of chimeric receptors generally assumed the properties of the donor receptors. Thus, BCC receptors internalized ligand to a similar extent as wild-type CCKA receptors (75 ± 3%), whereas, BMC receptors showed reduced ligand internalization (38 ± 1%). Receptor internalization was more directly assessed by determining agonist-induced loss of surface binding. BN and CCKA receptors were largely internalized (56 ± 8 and 50 ± 7%, respectively). BCC receptors were also extensively internalized (82 ± 3%). In contrast, BMC receptors were minimally internalized (22 ± 8%). Receptor recycling was assessed as recovery from agonist induced loss of binding. BN, CCKA, and BMC receptors showed rapid recycling. In contrast, BCC receptors did not recycle. These data indicate that carboxyl-terminal structures determine both internalization of ligand-receptor complexes and subsequent receptor recycling. To investigate the role of the carboxyl terminus in the regulation of the bombesin (BN) receptor, we constructed two chimeric receptors with carboxyl termini transferred from either m3 muscarinic cholinergic (m3 ACh) (BMC) or cholecystokinin A (CCKA) (BCC) receptors and expressed them in Chinese hamster ovary cells.

The promoter region of the H2A.X gene was characterized by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase analysis using Balb/c 3T3 cells. Maximal promoter activity was found in the construct containing up to −282 base pairs H2A.X upstream region. Within this region, we found two sequences regulating the promoter activation: one was an E2F site and another was a CCAAT box. These sequences were also required for the DNA/protein binding activities. Thus, these activities corresponded to the promoter activities, implying that the promoter activity of H2A.X gene was controlled by both the transcription factor E2F and H1TF2 through the E2F and CCAAT element. The CCAAT box binding activity was constitutive when cell cycle was progressed by release from G1 arrest, but transiently transfected chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity slightly increased when cells entered S phase. Similarly, the level of the smallest form of E2F (free E2F) became higher when cells reentered the cell cycle, indicating that the free E2F was one capable of inducing the promoter activation. Thus, the free E2F and CCAAT DNA binding activity correlated with regulation of the promoter activity.

One octamer core consists of eight molecules constituted by two molecules of respective core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4(1Zweidler A. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Marzluff W.F. Histone Genes: Structure, Organization, and Regulation. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 339-371Google Scholar). In the past, the histone octamer was thought to play a passive role in packaging DNA. However, now it is recognized that histones play crucial roles in DNA replication (2Bradbury E.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and transcription(3Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar).Four kinds of molecular variants belong to the H2A family. They are different in length and sequence. The histone H2A.1 and H2A.2 of mammalian cells are called major histones because they are primarily synthesized in concert with DNA replication during S phase of the cell cycle, while the other two, H2A.X and H2A.Z, are minor components and are synthesized constantly at low levels throughout the cell cycle(4Wu R.S. Bonner W.M. Cell. 1981; 27: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 5Wu R.S. Tsai S. Bonner W.M. Cell. 1982; 31: 367-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In vertebrate, the H2A.X protein represents 10% of the total H2A proteins, but the major H2As in lower eukaryotes contain the C-terminal amino acid sequence homologous to H2A.X(6Mannironi C. Bonner W.M. Hatch C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9113-9126Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 7Nagata T. Kato T. Morita T. Nozaki M. Kubota H. Yagi H. Matushiro A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2441-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It seems likely that histone H2A.X functions as nucleosomes associated with active genes, such as the immunoglobulin κ chain gene(8Huang S.-Y. Bernard M.B. Xu M. Matsui S. Rose S.M. Garrard W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3738-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).In mammalian cells, the major histone proteins are synthesized in DNA replication-dependent manners, and the expressions are regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (reviewed in (9Heintz N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 10Osley M.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 827-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 11Stein G.S. Stein J.L. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)). Histone gene transcription occurs throughout the cell cycle, but in the case of some major histone genes their transcription levels increase severalfold at the onset of S phase. Transcriptional regulation during the cell cycle of those genes is mediated by several consensus elements. In the case of post-transcriptional regulation, those mRNA levels are regulated in the following two steps: alterations in 3′-processing efficiency of mRNA and in mRNA stability(12Harris M.E. Böhni R. Schneiderman M.H. Ramamurthy L. Schümperli D. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2416-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Those genes are transcribed into non-polyadenylated mRNAs. These mRNA contain a common feature characteristic of a 3′-stem-loop motif, which regulates their mRNA stability, thereby controlling their mRNA levels during the cell cycle. Thus, the replication-dependent protein synthesis is post-transcriptionally controlled by the mRNA levels.The minor histone H2A.X protein is encoded by a single genomic gene without introns(13Ivanova V.S. Hatch C. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24189-24194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous study (7Nagata T. Kato T. Morita T. Nozaki M. Kubota H. Yagi H. Matushiro A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2441-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) indicated that two mRNA species were transcribed from the H2A.X gene: one was in a non-polyadenylated form, and the expression increased in S phase by post-transcriptional regulation; the other was not processed at the 3′-processing site and was polyadenylated at 0.8 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase pair(s)bpbase pair(s)CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasePCRpolymerase chain reaction. downstream of the processing site, and this mRNA was not expressed in a DNA replication-dependent manner. It is likely that the H2A.X protein is synthesized from those two forms of mRNAs in a partially cell cycle-dependent manner.In this paper, we report characterization of the mouse histone H2A.X promoter and of interactions between proteins and promoter activating sequences. CAT reporter gene transfection assay indicates that there are two activating sequences within the promoter region: one element is an E2F binding site and the other is a CCAAT box. However, these two elements are not the same as those required for the human promoter, even though the promoter sequence between mouse and human is highly conserved. The studies of the protein-DNA interactions suggest that the factor binding to the CCAAT box is a previously characterized factor H1TF2(14Gallinari P. La Bella F. Heintz N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1566-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). There are various forms of E2Fs due to multiple proteins binding to the E2F element(15Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3975-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Schwarz J.K. Devoto S.H. Smith E.J. Chellappan S.P. Jakoi E. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Among these E2Fs, a certain form of E2F (free E2F) is capable of inducing the promoter activation (16Schwarz J.K. Devoto S.H. Smith E.J. Chellappan S.P. Jakoi E. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 17Hamel P.A. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Mol. Cell.

In the case of H2A.X promoter, the level of the active form of E2F increases when cells reenter cell cycle. The increase explains the partial cell cycle-dependent activation of H2A.X promoter activity measured by CAT analysis.DISCUSSIONAnalysis of the DNA sequence upstream of the mouse H2A.X gene revealed that at about 1 kb upstream of the translation initiation site there was the GPT gene polyadenylation site and that these two genes, H2A.X and GPT, are transcribed in the same orientation. Downstream of the mouse H2A.X gene, porphobilinogen deaminase gene (35Beaumont C. Porcher C. Picat C. Nordmann Y. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14829-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was located as was seen in human and is supposedly transcribed in the opposite orientation of the H2A.X gene. 2H. Yagi, T. Kato, T. Nagata, T. Habu, M. Nozaki, A. Matsushiro, Y. Nishimune, and T. Morita, unpublished data. These results indicate that the H2A.X gene is not one of the clustered histone genes, unlike the case with the major histone genes.We have shown that the maximal promoter activity was localized within the region of 282 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site, that the proximal promoter of the mouse histone H2A.X gene contained two transcription activation sequences, E2F and CCAAT elements, and that those elements were able to form protein-DNA complexes as demonstrated by gel shift assays. The 5′-promoter regions of the vertebrate histone genes contain many transcriptional regulatory elements: several general promoter elements, e.g. the TATA box and CCAAT motif; elements found in a subfamily of histone genes; and elements that are found only in particular classes of histone genes. So far, involvement of the E2F element in transcriptional regulation of any histone gene has not been demonstrated. However, our results showed that the free E2F was closely associated with the promoter activation. Thus, it is likely that the E2F element is a transcriptional activation element for some histone genes containing the E2F element.Recently, human H2A.X gene was isolated, and its promoter was also characterized(13Ivanova V.S. Hatch C. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24189-24194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Between the human and mouse genes, the proximal promoter sequence was highly conserved. Two conserved CCAAT elements existed, but their properties were different in promoter activity. In mouse, our CAT assay indicated that the distal CCAAT element was involved in the promoter activation and that the proximal one was not. However, the different result has been reported in the human promoter. This different observation may have resulted from the diversification of promoter function between human and mouse. Although our CAT assay did not show the effect of the proximal CCAAT element, the conservation suggests that its effect on the promoter activity might be observed by a different experimental method.A protein-DNA complex was observed by gel retardation assay when the promoter activation region containing the two CCAAT motifs was tested. In the case of mouse H2A.X, only one CCAAT sequence in this region, which was conserved between the human and mouse H2A.X, was needed for the protein-DNA interaction. The necessity of this same CCAAT motif for promoter activation was also demonstrated by the CAT assay, as discussed above. Thus, it is likely that a factor binding to the CCAAT element is required for mouse H2A.X promoter activation. The competition analysis showed that the mutations in the CCAAT flanking sequences also affected DNA binding activity. These results were also consistent with those of the CAT reporter gene studies.As mentioned above, the CCAAT sequence is essential for the protein to bind to DNA, but the flanking sequences also affect its binding activity. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing various types of CCAAT elements competed for the H2A.X promoter binding factor to various degrees. Their competition activities were as follows: C-WT#8773;H1TF2>>>Eα>α-Glob. Since the H1TF2 fragment most strongly competed the H2A.X CCAAT box, it is likely that the factor H1TF2 binds to the H2A.X CCAAT sequence.A DNA binding factor, H1TF2, has been characterized as a transcriptional activator as well as a cell cycle regulator in HeLa cells(14Gallinari P. La Bella F. Heintz N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1566-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 36La Bella F. Gallinari P. McKinney J. Heinz N. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1982-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has been reported that its DNA binding activity increased 2-5-fold in S phase as compared with that in G1 phase. In contrast, our experiment showed that the H2A.X CCAAT box binding activity was not much altered during the cell cycle in Balb/c 3T3 cells and that the H2A.X CCAAT box apparently bound to H1TF2, as discussed above. Although the above report showed the pattern of complex formation in the cell cycle different from ours, we would like to consider that H1TF2 is the one binding to the CCAAT element in H2A.X promoter. As indicated by the transient CAT assay and gel retardation assay, the constitutive complex formation was correlated with the promoter activity. Thus, it seems likely that the H2A.X CCAAT binding factor activates the H2A.X transcription throughout cell cycle.Gel retardation assay showed that the E2F factor bound to the E2F consensus element of H2A.X gene and that E2F could exist in free E2F or in complex with other partner proteins such as a family of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene protein (pRB, p107, and p130) (17Hamel P.A.

Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2392-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Bands A and B in our gel retardation experiments are likely to be formed between the free E2F and those pRB family proteins. Since pRB and p107 inhibited E2F-dependent gene expression (16Schwarz J.K.

Nature. 1992; 358: 259-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), it is likely that only band C (free E2F) could activate the gene expression. Our results indicated that the amounts of E2F complexes A and B were remarkably reduced as cells entered S phase and that free E2F increased when cells re-entered the cell cycle. Thus, we consider that the promoter of histone HA.X was activated partially, when the cells entered the G1/S boundary, due to the increase in free E2F. Since the amount of band C after the treatment with deoxycholate was constant throughout the cell cycle, the other bands are likely formed between the free E2F and its partner proteins depending on the cell cycle. Though the free E2F are thought to have transcription-stimulating activity, we cannot rule out the possibility that the fastest migrating complex D, which emerged from the cells entering S phase, might have a positive role in H2A.X transcription.

It seems likely that histone H2A.X functions as nucleosomes associated with active genes, such as the immunoglobulin κ chain gene(8Huang S.-Y. Bernard M.B. Xu M. Matsui S. Rose S.M. Garrard W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3738-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the major histone proteins are synthesized in DNA replication-dependent manners, and the expressions are regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (reviewed in (9Heintz N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 10Osley M.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 827-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 11Stein G.S. Stein J.L. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)). Histone gene transcription occurs throughout the cell cycle, but in the case of some major histone genes their transcription levels increase severalfold at the onset of S phase. Transcriptional regulation during the cell cycle of those genes is mediated by several consensus elements. In the case of post-transcriptional regulation, those mRNA levels are regulated in the following two steps: alterations in 3′-processing efficiency of mRNA and in mRNA stability(12Harris M.E. Böhni R. Schneiderman M.H. Ramamurthy L. Schümperli D. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2416-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Those genes are transcribed into non-polyadenylated mRNAs. These mRNA contain a common feature characteristic of a 3′-stem-loop motif, which regulates their mRNA stability, thereby controlling their mRNA levels during the cell cycle. Thus, the replication-dependent protein synthesis is post-transcriptionally controlled by the mRNA levels. The minor histone H2A.X protein is encoded by a single genomic gene without introns(13Ivanova V.S. Hatch C. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24189-24194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous study (7Nagata T. Kato T. Morita T. Nozaki M. Kubota H. Yagi H. Matushiro A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2441-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) indicated that two mRNA species were transcribed from the H2A.X gene: one was in a non-polyadenylated form, and the expression increased in S phase by post-transcriptional regulation; the other was not processed at the 3′-processing site and was polyadenylated at 0.8 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase pair(s)bpbase pair(s)CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasePCRpolymerase chain reaction. downstream of the processing site, and this mRNA was not expressed in a DNA replication-dependent manner. It is likely that the H2A.X protein is synthesized from those two forms of mRNAs in a partially cell cycle-dependent manner. kilobase pair(s) base pair(s) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase polymerase chain reaction. In this paper, we report characterization of the mouse histone H2A.X promoter and of interactions between proteins and promoter activating sequences. CAT reporter gene transfection assay indicates that there are two activating sequences within the promoter region: one element is an E2F binding site and the other is a CCAAT box. However, these two elements are not the same as those required for the human promoter, even though the promoter sequence between mouse and human is highly conserved. The studies of the protein-DNA interactions suggest that the factor binding to the CCAAT box is a previously characterized factor H1TF2(14Gallinari P. La Bella F. Heintz N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1566-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). There are various forms of E2Fs due to multiple proteins binding to the E2F element(15Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3975-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Schwarz J.K. Devoto S.H. Smith E.J. Chellappan S.P. Jakoi E. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Among these E2Fs, a certain form of E2F (free E2F) is capable of inducing the promoter activation (16Schwarz J.K. Devoto S.H. Smith E.J. Chellappan S.P. Jakoi E. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 17Hamel P.A. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Mol. Cell.

In the case of H2A.X promoter, the level of the active form of E2F increases when cells reenter cell cycle. The increase explains the partial cell cycle-dependent activation of H2A.X promoter activity measured by CAT analysis. DISCUSSIONAnalysis of the DNA sequence upstream of the mouse H2A.X gene revealed that at about 1 kb upstream of the translation initiation site there was the GPT gene polyadenylation site and that these two genes, H2A.X and GPT, are transcribed in the same orientation. Downstream of the mouse H2A.X gene, porphobilinogen deaminase gene (35Beaumont C. Porcher C. Picat C. Nordmann Y. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14829-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was located as was seen in human and is supposedly transcribed in the opposite orientation of the H2A.X gene. 2H. Yagi, T. Kato, T. Nagata, T. Habu, M. Nozaki, A. Matsushiro, Y. Nishimune, and T. Morita, unpublished data. These results indicate that the H2A.X gene is not one of the clustered histone genes, unlike the case with the major histone genes.We have shown that the maximal promoter activity was localized within the region of 282 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site, that the proximal promoter of the mouse histone H2A.X gene contained two transcription activation sequences, E2F and CCAAT elements, and that those elements were able to form protein-DNA complexes as demonstrated by gel shift assays. The 5′-promoter regions of the vertebrate histone genes contain many transcriptional regulatory elements: several general promoter elements, e.g. the TATA box and CCAAT motif; elements found in a subfamily of histone genes; and elements that are found only in particular classes of histone genes. So far, involvement of the E2F element in transcriptional regulation of any histone gene has not been demonstrated. However, our results showed that the free E2F was closely associated with the promoter activation. Thus, it is likely that the E2F element is a transcriptional activation element for some histone genes containing the E2F element.Recently, human H2A.X gene was isolated, and its promoter was also characterized(13Ivanova V.S. Hatch C. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24189-24194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Between the human and mouse genes, the proximal promoter sequence was highly conserved. Two conserved CCAAT elements existed, but their properties were different in promoter activity. In mouse, our CAT assay indicated that the distal CCAAT element was involved in the promoter activation and that the proximal one was not. However, the different result has been reported in the human promoter. This different observation may have resulted from the diversification of promoter function between human and mouse. Although our CAT assay did not show the effect of the proximal CCAAT element, the conservation suggests that its effect on the promoter activity might be observed by a different experimental method.A protein-DNA complex was observed by gel retardation assay when the promoter activation region containing the two CCAAT motifs was tested. In the case of mouse H2A.X, only one CCAAT sequence in this region, which was conserved between the human and mouse H2A.X, was needed for the protein-DNA interaction. The necessity of this same CCAAT motif for promoter activation was also demonstrated by the CAT assay, as discussed above. Thus, it is likely that a factor binding to the CCAAT element is required for mouse H2A.X promoter activation. The competition analysis showed that the mutations in the CCAAT flanking sequences also affected DNA binding activity. These results were also consistent with those of the CAT reporter gene studies.As mentioned above, the CCAAT sequence is essential for the protein to bind to DNA, but the flanking sequences also affect its binding activity. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing various types of CCAAT elements competed for the H2A.X promoter binding factor to various degrees. Their competition activities were as follows: C-WT#8773;H1TF2>>>Eα>α-Glob. Since the H1TF2 fragment most strongly competed the H2A.X CCAAT box, it is likely that the factor H1TF2 binds to the H2A.X CCAAT sequence.A DNA binding factor, H1TF2, has been characterized as a transcriptional activator as well as a cell cycle regulator in HeLa cells(14Gallinari P. La Bella F. Heintz N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1566-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 36La Bella F. Gallinari P. McKinney J. Heinz N. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1982-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has been reported that its DNA binding activity increased 2-5-fold in S phase as compared with that in G1 phase. In contrast, our experiment showed that the H2A.X CCAAT box binding activity was not much altered during the cell cycle in Balb/c 3T3 cells and that the H2A.X CCAAT box apparently bound to H1TF2, as discussed above. Although the above report showed the pattern of complex formation in the cell cycle different from ours, we would like to consider that H1TF2 is the one binding to the CCAAT element in H2A.X promoter. As indicated by the transient CAT assay and gel retardation assay, the constitutive complex formation was correlated with the promoter activity. Thus, it seems likely that the H2A.X CCAAT binding factor activates the H2A.X transcription throughout cell cycle.Gel retardation assay showed that the E2F factor bound to the E2F consensus element of H2A.X gene and that E2F could exist in free E2F or in complex with other partner proteins such as a family of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene protein (pRB, p107, and p130) (17Hamel P.A.

Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2392-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Bands A and B in our gel retardation experiments are likely to be formed between the free E2F and those pRB family proteins. Since pRB and p107 inhibited E2F-dependent gene expression (16Schwarz J.K.

Nature. 1992; 358: 259-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), it is likely that only band C (free E2F) could activate the gene expression. Our results indicated that the amounts of E2F complexes A and B were remarkably reduced as cells entered S phase and that free E2F increased when cells re-entered the cell cycle. Thus, we consider that the promoter of histone HA.X was activated partially, when the cells entered the G1/S boundary, due to the increase in free E2F. Since the amount of band C after the treatment with deoxycholate was constant throughout the cell cycle, the other bands are likely formed between the free E2F and its partner proteins depending on the cell cycle. Though the free E2F are thought to have transcription-stimulating activity, we cannot rule out the possibility that the fastest migrating complex D, which emerged from the cells entering S phase, might have a positive role in H2A.X transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2136748705,"We describe the characterization of a novel G protein α subunit, Gα<sub>a</sub>. cDNA encoding this subunit was cloned from the central nervous system of the mollusc <i>Lymnaea stagnalis</i>. The deduced protein contains all characteristic guanine nucleotide-binding domains of Gα subunits but shares only a limited degree of overall sequence identity with known subtypes (∼30%). Moreover, two of the nucleotide-binding domains exhibit salient deviations from corresponding sequences in other G protein α subunits. The A domain, determining kinetic features of the GTPase cycle, contains a markedly unique amino acid sequence (ILIIGGPGAGK). In addition, the C domain is also clearly distinct (DVAGQRSL). The presence of a leucine in this motif, instead of glutamic acid, has important implications for hypotheses concerning the GTPase mechanism. In contrast to other Gα subtypes, Gα<sub>a</sub> has no appropriate N-terminal residues that could be acylated. It does contain the strictly conserved arginine residue that serves as a cholera toxin substrate in Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>t</sub> but lacks a site for ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin. <i>In situ</i> hybridization experiments indicate that Gα<sub>a</sub>-encoding mRNA is expressed in a limited subpopulation of neurons within the <i>Lymnaea</i> brain. These data suggest that Gα<sub>a</sub> defines a separate class of G proteins with cell type-specific functions."
