https://openalex.org/W2000540954,"After extensive field experiments, we developed SPAM, a comprehensive mathematical model that simulates energy and material exchange in the plantair layer at the earth's interface. The model is based upon the conservation of energy, where the sun is the driving force. Our understanding and deficiencies were gauged initially by testing model predictions against actual experience with a relatively simple system-a cornfield. Climatic predictions are physically and biologically good enough for many applications, but they reveal inadequacies in our understanding of the fluid dynamics of airflow within the plant stand. Our present inability to measure or predict the degree of wetness of the soil surface hampers correct prediction of evaporation. Probably the most difficult problem to resolve is that of predicting how stomates open and close under drought stress, thus affecting both evaporation and photosynthesis in leaves. Along with resolution of these problems, the basic framework of the model can be adapted to more complex systems in nature, where variability is much greater than in an agricultural crop. The model in its present form can be used, with caution, as a powerful tool to help man order his priorities of plant community traits for whatever outcome he desires, be it food production, nature and water conservation, climate modification, or esthetic enjoyment."

It probably originated in deciduous tree populations already present locally in conifer forest between 24,000 and 18,600 years before present. The cold, dry Late Wisconsin climate ended before 14,600 years before present. A transitional warm, dry phase preceded a precipitation increase at 14,000 years before present."
https://openalex.org/W2044146026,"Documentation of settlement patterns and deforestation in the southeastern United States allows evaluation of regional carbon dynamics since A.D. 1750. From 1750 to 1950, the Southeast was a net source for carbon at an average rate of 0.13 gigaton per year. Only in the past 20 to 30 years has increased productivity of commercial forests resulted in a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide of 0.07 gigaton per year."
https://openalex.org/W1978102560,"A new insect juvenile hormone was isolated from developing embryos of the tobacco hornworm moth, Manduca sexta. The new hormone was found with juvenile hormone I and is a 1-carbon homolog of this substance. The assigned structure is methyl (2E,6E,10-cis)-10,11-epoxy-3,7-diethyl-11-methyl-2,6-tridecadienoate, which constitutes a trishomosesquiterpenoid skeleton. This is the first chemical idetification of any juvenile hormone from insect eggs."
https://openalex.org/W2077526426,"Subglacially erupted volcanic rocks from Mount Early and Sheridan Bluff, Antarctica, yield whole-rock potassium-argon dates and argon-40/argon-39 release spectra of Early Miocene age. Field associations suggest the existence of the East Antarctic ice sheet and significant uplift of the Transantarctic Mountains by that time."
https://openalex.org/W2000296955,"The use of liquid hydrogen as a long-term replacement for hydrocarbon fuel for land and air transportation seems technically feasible. It is an ideal fuel from the standpoint of a completely cyclic system, serving as a ""working substance"" in a closed chemical and thermodynamic cycle. The energy-per-unit-weight advantage (a factor of 3) over gasoline or any other hydrocarbon fuel makes liquid hydrogen particularly advantageous for air craft and long-range land transport. As a pollution-free fuel, it must be seriously considered as the logical replacement for hydrocarbons in the 21st century."
https://openalex.org/W2028382268,"Barnacles attached to the California gray whale have oxygen isotope compositions that serve as a record of changing ocean temperatures as the whale migrates between arctic and subtropical waters. The isotopic values for the barnacles can be used to track whale migrations and to reconstruct the recent movements of beached whales. The method may be useful for tracing the movements of other animals, living or fossil, and for reconstructing the voyages of ancient ships."
https://openalex.org/W2025321017,"A comparison of the size of polar coronal holes with the cosmic-ray intensity observed during the most recent sunspot cycle shows close correspondence. This lends support to recent suggestions that the well-known sunspot-cycle modulation of cosmic rays is a three-dimensional effect, probably related to the global character of the interplanetary magnetic field."
https://openalex.org/W2011920770,"The relative rates of racemization for amino acid residues at the NH(2) and COOH ends of 37 different dipeptides were determined. In nine dipeptides containing alanine, leucine, phenylalanine, aspartic acid, and methionine, the amino acid residue racemized faster at the COOH-terminal position than at the NH(2)-terminal position (COOH > NH(2)). The sterically hindered amino acids isoleucine and valine showed NH(2) > COOH. Six proline dipeptides showed NH(2) > COOH. Intramolecular effects have been invoked to explain these surprising results."
https://openalex.org/W2054780768,"Today's ice cover (2 to 4 meters thick) over the Arctic Ocean provides a shadow that prevents coccolithophorids (photosynthetic, planktonic algae) from living there. Sparse, low-diversity, but indigenous coccolith assemblages in late Pliocene to mid-Pleistocene (but not Holocene) sediments imply deep penetrating warm currents or an ice-free Arctic Ocean, or both, as those layers were being deposited."
https://openalex.org/W1967666217,"Mechanically isolated cell walls of the conchocelis phase of Bangia fuscopurpurea yield cellulose II (regenerated cellulose) upon treatment with Schweitzer's reagent. X-ray powder analysis and thin-layer chromatography of partial hydrolyzates confirm the presence of cellulose in this extract. Gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of wall hydrolyzates indicates that xylose, mannose, galactose, and glucose are major wall constituents. The presence of cellulose in the conchocelis provides evidence that this bangiophycean life cycle phase represents a transitional form or link between the two classes of red algae, Bangiophyceae and Florideophyceae. This suggests a close affinity of the two classes of the Rhodophyta and supports the hypothesis that bangiophycean algae were precursors of the Florideophyceae."
https://openalex.org/W2022290494,"Unlike most insect integuments, the body surfaces of certain bark-inhabiting bugs are wettable. A thin film of water reduces the reflectivity of the insect, resulting in a close match with the wettable bark upon which it rests. Wettability probably aids in concealing the insects from predators."
