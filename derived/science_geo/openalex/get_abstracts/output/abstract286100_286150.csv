https://openalex.org/W2004177958,"The eddy correlation method was used to measure the net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide continuously from April 1990 to December 1991 in a deciduous forest in central Massachusetts. The annual net uptake was 3.7 +/- 0.7 metric tons of carbon per hectare per year. Ecosystem respiration, calculated from the relation between nighttime exchange and soil temperature, was 7.4 metric tons of carbon per hectare per year, implying gross ecosystem production of 11.1 metric tons of carbon per hectare per year. The observed rate of accumulation of carbon reflects recovery from agricultural development in the 1800s. Carbon uptake rates were notably larger than those assumed for temperate forests in global carbon studies. Carbon storage in temperate forests can play an important role in determining future concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide."

Although impact of a 32-molecule NaCl cluster on a solid surface at 3 kilometers per second leads to melting, disordering, fragmentation, and rebounding, the same size cluster colliding with a liquid neon film transfers its energy efficiently to the liquid for a controlled soft landing. Impact on a higher density film (argon) leads to rapid attenuation of the cluster velocity, accompanied by fast heating. Subsequent disordering, melting, and fast cooling by evaporation of argon quench the cluster to a glassy state. These results suggest a method for the controlled growth of nanophase materials."

One of these, the densest form (epsilon phase, hexagonal close-packed) is considered to have formed Earth's core. Theoretical arguments based on available high-temperature and high-pressure iron data indicate the possibility of a fifth less dense iron phase forming the core. Study of iron phase transition conducted between pressures of 20 to 100 gigapascals and 1000 to 2200 Kelvin provides an experimental confirmation of the existence of this new phase. Thee epsilon iron phase transforms to this lower density phase before melting. The new phase may form a large part of Earth's core."

It is now possible to produce CVD diamond with properties approaching those of IIa natural diamonds. The combined electron-hole mobility, as measured by transient photoconductivity at low carrier density, is 4000 square centimeters per volt per second at an electric field of 200 volts per centimeter and is comparable to that of the best single-crystal IIa natural diamonds. Carrier lifetimes measured under the same conditions are 150 picoseconds for the CVD diamond and 300 picoseconds for single-crystal diamond. The collection distance at a field of 10 kilovolts per centimeter is 15 micrometers for the CVD diamond as compared to 30 micrometers for natural diamonds. The electrical qualities appear to correlate with the width of the diamond Raman peak. Also, although the collection distance at the highest fields in the films nearly equals the average grain size, there is no evidence of deleterious grain boundary effects."

https://openalex.org/W2110754702,"The exploration of the universe has captured mankind's interest since the earliest attempts to understand the sun, moon, planets, comets, and stars. The last few decades have seen explosive advances of knowledge, sparked by technological advances and by our entry into the space age. Achievements in solar system exploration, discoveries both in the Milky Way and in the farther universe, and challenges for the future are discussed. Of major concern worldwide is the need for people of goodwill in all nations to concentrate on the peaceful uses of outer space and on international collaboration."

For urban universities, the ability to adapt to changing needs and seize new opportunities has become vital. These universities must take the lead in curricular revision, research emphasizing the application of knowledge, arrangements with private economic enterprises, and public service to improve science and mathematics training in the schools."
