https://openalex.org/W2889339014,"To find an electrical conductivity (EC) in the nutrient solution used for pakchoi (Brassica campestris L. ssp. Chinensis) cultivation that optimizes the plant's physiology, growth, and quality, we conducted an experiment with eight EC treatments (from EC0 to EC9.6) in a hydroponic production system (i.e. soilless culture) under greenhouse condition in Shanghai, China. Plants biomass production, leaf photosynthesis, vegetable quality variables, tissue nitrate and nitrite contents, and antioxidant enzyme activities were measured. The results showed that very high (EC9.6) or low EC (EC0-0.6) treatments clearly decreased plants fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW), leaf size, leaf water content, leaf net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), transpiration rate (Tr), and taste score. Nitrite content, and antioxidant enzyme activities were low in medium EC treatments (EC1.8 and EC2.4), but high in very high or low EC treatments. Leaf relative chlorophyll, ascorbic acid, and nitrate contents increased gradually from low EC to high EC treatments, while crude fiber and soluble sugar contents decreased. Based on growth and quality criteria, the optimal EC treatment would be EC1.8 or EC2.4 for pakchoi in the hydroponic production system. Too high or too low EC would induce nutrient stress, enhance plant antioxidant enzyme activities, and suppress pakchoi growth and quality."
https://openalex.org/W2808823912,"Background Particulate matter (PM) pollutant exposure, which induces oxidative stress and inflammation, and vitamin D insufficiency, which compromises immune regulation, are detrimental in asthma. Objectives Mechanistic cell culture experiments were undertaken to ascertain whether vitamin D abrogates PM-induced inflammatory responses of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) through enhancement of antioxidant pathways. Methods Transcriptome analysis, PCR and ELISA were undertaken to delineate markers of inflammation and oxidative stress; with comparison of expression in primary HBECs from healthy and asthmatic donors cultured with reference urban PM in the presence/absence of vitamin D. Results Transcriptome analysis identified over 500 genes significantly perturbed by PM-stimulation, including multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines. Vitamin D altered expression of a subset of these PM-induced genes, including suppressing IL6. Addition of vitamin D suppressed PM-stimulated IL-6 production, although to significantly greater extent in healthy versus asthmatic donor cultures. Vitamin D also differentially affected PM-stimulated GM-CSF, with suppression in healthy HBECs and enhancement in asthmatic cultures. Vitamin D increased HBEC expression of the antioxidant pathway gene G6PD, increased the ratio of reduced to oxidised glutathione, and in PM-stimulated cultures decreased the formation of 8-isoprostane. Pre-treatment with vitamin D decreased CXCL8 and further decreased IL-6 production in PM-stimulated cultures, an effect abrogated by inhibition of G6PD with DHEA, supporting a role for this pathway in the anti-inflammatory actions of vitamin D. Conclusions In a study using HBECs from 18 donors, vitamin D enhanced HBEC antioxidant responses and modulated the immune response to PM, suggesting that vitamin D may protect the airways from pathological pollution-induced inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2888772962,"Wild boar (Sus scrofa) population spread into urban and periurban areas has exacerbated conflicts with humans. There is a need for planned wild boar management strategies, and Population viability analysis (PVA) combined with perturbation analyses allow the assessment of the management effort of control methods. Our study aims to develop stochastic predictive models of the increasing wild boar population of the 80 km2 peri-urban Mediterranean area of Collserola Natural Park (CNP), located near Barcelona, Spain, as well as assessing specific management measures (including reduced food availability, selective harvest, and reduction in fertility). Population parameters were estimated from previously published census and hunting data provided by the CNP and the local hunting administration. The results revealed that under the current conditions the CNP wild boar population will continue to increase. The most efficient strategy to reduce wild boar abundance was a combination of reducing supplementary anthropogenic food resources and selective removal of juvenile (<1 year) and yearling (1–2 years) wild boar. These strategies will probably be also the most efficient ones in other oversupplemented increasing wild boar populations in similar situations, although specific studies will be needed to fine-tune the best management option for each context. PVA allows the prediction of future population trends and the assessment of the efficacy and efficiency of potential management strategies before implementing management measures."
https://openalex.org/W2888788551,"Aim Infections with carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) are among the most frequent complications in the immunocompromised cancer patients because of their considerable morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to characterize the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing GNB recovered from febrile neutropenic pediatric cancer patients in Egypt. Methods Standard methods were used for identification, sensitivity testing (Kirby-Bauer and broth microdilution method according to CLSI guidelines). Standard methods were applied for both phenotypic and genotypic detection of the carbapenemase-producing GNB. Results A total of 185 GNB were recovered from different clinical specimens, Escherichia (E.) coli (86; 46.48%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (71; 38.37%), Acinetobacter (A.) baumannii (7; 3.78%) and others including Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter (Ent.) cloacae and Proteus spp. (21; 11.35%). It is a matter of concern that 116 out of 171 enterobacterial isolates (94.15%) showed resistance to three or more antimicrobial classes and were considered multidrug resistant. Additionally, the rate of carbapenem-resistance displayed a worrisome trend as 113 out of 171 enterobacterial isolates (66.08%) and 12 out of 14 non fermenting bacilli (85.71%) showed resistance pattern to at least one of the tested carbapenems. After performing a series of phenotypic tests for initial screening of potential carbapenemase producers, molecular characterization to the 29 extracted plasmids were subjected to PCR (using 5 common carbapenemase primers). The results revealed that blaOXA-48 was the most prevalent 17 (58.62%), followed by blaNDM 8(27.58%), then blaVIM 3 (10.3%) and blaKPC 2 (6.89%). Conclusion These results are an alarming threat to public health that calls for urgent application of antimicrobial stewardship programs along with routine surveillance for controlling outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2889453710,"One challenge to achieving Millennium Development Goals was inequitable access to quality health services. In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, interventions need to reach underserved populations. Analyzing health indicators in small geographic units aids the identification of hotspots where coverage lags behind neighboring areas. The purpose of these analyses is to identify areas of low coverage or high need in order to inform effective resource allocation to reduce child health inequity between and within countries. Using data from The Demographic and Health Survey Program surveys conducted in 27 selected African countries between 2010 and 2014, we computed estimates for six child health indicators for subnational regions. We calculated Global Moran’s I statistics and used Local Indicator of Spatial Association analysis to produce a spatial layer showing spatial associations. We created maps to visualize sub-national autocorrelation and spatial clusters. The Global Moran’s I statistic was positive for each indicator (range: 0.41 to 0.68), and statistically significant (p <0.05), suggesting spatial autocorrelation across national borders, and highlighting the need to examine health indicators both across countries and within them. Patterns of substantial differences among contiguous subareas were apparent; the average intra-country difference for each indicator exceeded 20 percentage points. Clusters of cross-border associations were also apparent, facilitating the identification of hotspots and informing the allocation of resources to reduce child health inequity between and within countries. This study exposes differences in health indicators in contiguous geographic areas, indicating that specific regional and subnational, in addition to national, strategies to improve health and reduce health inequalities are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2888999073,"The world is rapidly urbanizing, and many previously biodiverse areas are now mostly composed of impervious surface. This loss of natural habitat causes local bird communities to become dominated by urban dweller and urban utilizer species and reduces the amount of habitat available for migrating and breeding birds. Green roofs can increase green space in urban landscapes, potentially providing new habitat for wildlife. We surveyed birds and arthropods, an important food source for birds, on green roofs and nearby comparable conventional (non-green) roofs in New York City during spring migration and summer breeding seasons. We predicted that green roofs would have a greater abundance and richness of both birds and arthropods than conventional roofs during both migration and the breeding season for birds. Furthermore, we predicted we would find more urban avoider and urban utilizer bird species on green roofs than conventional roofs. We found that both birds and arthropods were more abundant and rich on green roofs than conventional roofs. In addition, green roofs hosted more urban avoider and utilizer bird species than conventional roofs. Our study shows that birds use green roofs as stopover habitat during migration and as foraging habitat during the breeding season. Establishing green roofs in urban landscapes increases the amount of habitat available for migrating and breeding birds and can partially mitigate the loss of habitat due to increasing urbanization."
https://openalex.org/W2889223125,"This paper studies the structure of the Japanese production network, which includes one million firms and five million supplier-customer links. This study finds that this network forms a tightly-knit structure with a core giant strongly connected component (GSCC) surrounded by IN and OUT components constituting two half-shells of the GSCC, which we call a\textit{walnut} structure because of its shape. The hierarchical structure of the communities is studied by the Infomap method, and most of the irreducible communities are found to be at the second level. The composition of some of the major communities, including overexpressions regarding their industrial or regional nature, and the connections that exist between the communities are studied in detail. The findings obtained here cause us to question the validity and accuracy of using the conventional input-output analysis, which is expected to be useful when firms in the same sectors are highly connected to each other."
https://openalex.org/W2888922959,"Previous studies have shown that modified apelin analogues exhibited enzyme resistance in plasma and improved circulating half-life compared to apelin-13. This study investigated the antidiabetic effects of chronic administration of stable long acting fatty acid modified apelin analogues, namely, (Lys8GluPAL)apelin-13 amide and pGlu(Lys8GluPAL)apelin-13 amide, in high-fat fed obese-diabetic mice. Male NIH Swiss mice (groups n = 8) were maintained either on a high-fat diet (45% fat) from 8 to 28 weeks old, or control mice were fed a normal diet (10% fat). When diet induced obesity-diabetes was established after high-fat feeding, mice were injected i.p. once daily with apelin analogues, liraglutide (25 nmol/kg) or saline (controls). Administration of (Lys8GluPAL)apelin-13 amide and pGlu(Lys8GluPAL)apelin-13 amide for 28 days significantly reduced food intake and decreased body weight. Non-fasting glucose was reduced (p<0.01 to p<0.001) and plasma insulin concentrations increased (p<0.01 to p<0.001). This was accompanied by enhanced insulin responses (p<0.01 to p<0.001) and significant reductions in glucose excursion after oral (p<0.01) or i.p. (p<0.01) glucose challenges and feeding. Apelin analogues also significantly improved HbA1c (p<0.01), enhanced insulin sensitivity (p<0.01), reduced triglycerides (p<0.001), increased HDL-cholesterol (p<0.01) and decreased LDL-cholesterol (p<0.01), compared to high-fat fed saline treated control mice. Cholesterol levels were decreased (p<0.01) by pGlu(Lys8GluPAL)apelin-13 amide and both apelin treated groups showed improved bone mineral content, reduced fat deposits and increased plasma GLP-1. Daily treatment with liraglutide mirrored many of these changes (not on bone or adipose tissue), but unlike apelin analogues increased plasma amylase. Consumption of O2, production of CO2, respiratory exchange ratio and energy expenditure were improved by apelin analogues. These results indicate that long-term treatment with acylated analogues (Lys8GluPAL)apelin-13 amide and particularly pGlu(Lys8GluPAL)apelin-13 amide resulted in similar or enhanced therapeutic responses to liraglutide in high-fat fed mice. Fatty acid derived apelin analogues represent a new and exciting development in the treatment of obesity-diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2889407314,"Endolichenic fungi (ELF) are unexplored group of organisms as a source for the production of bioactive secondary metabolites with radical scavenging activity, antilipase and amylase inhibitory activities. Endolichenic fungi in lichens collected from mangrove or mangrove associated plants are least known for their fungal diversity and potential to produce bioactive compounds. A total of 171 ELF strains were isolated from the lichens collected from mangrove and mangrove associated plants in Puttalam lagoon. Out of this collection, 70 isolates were identified using rDNA-ITS region sequence homology to the GenBank accessions and a phylogenetic analysis was performed. Commonly isolated genera of ELF from lichens were Aspergillus, Byssochlamys, Talaromyces, Diaporthe, Phomopsis, Endomelanconiopsis, Schizophyllum, Cerrena, Trichoderma, Xylaria, Hypoxylon, Daldinia, Preussia, Sordaria, Neurospora, and Lasiodiplodia. In the present study, the effectiveness of ethyl acetate extracts of the ELF isolates were investigated against antioxidant activity, antilipase activity and α-amylase inhibition activity in in-vitro conditions. The results revealed that the extracts of Daldinia eschscholtzii, Diaporthe musigena and Sordaria sp. had the highest radical scavenging activity with smaller IC50 values (25 μg/mL to 31 μg/mL) compared to the IC50 values of BHT (76.50±1.47 μg/mL). Antilipase assay revealed that 13 extracts from ELF showed promising antiobesity activity ranged between 25% to 40%. Amylase inhibitory assay indicated that the test extracts do not contain antidiabetic secondary metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W2889416513,"The financial crisis of 2007/08 precipitated a severe global economic downturn, typically referred to as the Great Recession. However, in the United Kingdom this period has been marked by limited change in national indicators of subjective well-being. We assessed the life satisfaction change in response to the Great Recession in a sample of British adults (N = 8,661). We first show that on average the life satisfaction change across the sample was limited. However, average effects may mask substantial amounts of heterogeneity in the data. We therefore explore beyond this average effect to determine whether there were disproportionate changes (losses and gains) in life satisfaction in key sub-groups of the population. We found that individuals experiencing unemployment, who lost income, were sick or disabled, experienced the greatest well-being reductions. Contrastingly the life satisfaction of many individuals did not greatly change following the Great Recession and for some it may have even improved. Our work highlights vulnerable groups that may need additional help during recession periods and also cautions against the over reliance on average measures of well-being."
https://openalex.org/W2889547122,"The Characeae are multicellular green algae with very close relationship to land plants. Their internodal cells have been the subject of numerous (electro-)physiological studies. When exposed to light, internodal cells display alternating bands of low and high pH along their surface in order to facilitate carbon uptake required for photosynthesis. Here we investigated for the first time the subcellular membrane protein composition of acidic and alkaline regions in internodal cells of Chara australis R. Br. using MS-proteomics. The identified peptides were annotated to Chara unigenes using a custom-made Chara database generated from a transcriptome analysis and to orthologous Arabidopsis genes using TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resource) database. Apart from providing the first public-available, functionally-annotated sequence database for Chara australis, the proteome study, which is supported by immunodetection, identified several membrane proteins associated with acidic regions that contain a high density of specific plasma membrane (PM) invaginations, the charasomes, which locally increase the membrane area to overcome diffusion limitation in membrane transport. An increased abundance of PM H+ ATPases at charasomes is consistent with their role in the acidification of the environment, but the characean PM H+ ATPase sequence suggests a different regulation compared to higher plant PM H+ ATPases. A higher abundance of H+ co-transporters in the charasome-rich, acidic regions possibly reflects enhanced uptake of ions and nutrients. The increase in mitochondrial proteins confirms earlier findings about the accumulation of cortical mitochondria in the acidic zones. The significant enrichment of clathrin heavy chains and clathrin adaptor proteins as well as other proteins involved in trafficking indicate a higher activity of membrane transport in the charasome-rich than in charasome-poor areas. New and unexpected data, for instance the upregulation and abundance of vacuolar transporters correlating with the charasome-rich, acidic cell regions account for new perspectives in the formation of charasomes."
https://openalex.org/W2787242366,"Migratory species often roam vast distances bringing them into contact with diverse conditions and threats that could play significant roles in their population dynamics. This is especially true if long-range travels occur within crucial stages of a species’ annual life-cycle. Crested penguins, for example, usually disperse over several hundreds of kilometres after completing the energetically demanding breeding season and in preparation for the costly annual moult. A basic understanding of crested penguins’ pre-moult dispersal is therefore paramount in order to be able to assess factors affecting individual survival. The Fiordland penguin, or Tawaki, the only crested penguin species breeding on the New Zealand mainland, is currently one of the least studied and rarest penguin species in the world. We successfully satellite tracked the pre-moult dispersal of 17 adult Tawaki from a single colony located in the species’ northern breeding distribution. Over the course of 8–10 weeks the penguins travelled up to 2,500 km away from their breeding colony, covering total swimming distances of up to 6,800 km. During outbound travels all penguins headed south-west within a well-defined corridor before branching out towards two general trip destinations. Birds leaving in late November travelled towards the Subtropical Front some 800 km south of Tasmania, whereas penguins that left in December headed further towards the subantarctic front. Using K-select analysis we examined the influence of oceanographic factors on the penguins’ dispersal. Water depth, surface current velocity and sea level anomalies had the greatest influence on penguin movements at the subantarctic Front, while sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration were key for birds travelling to the subtropical front. We discuss our findings in the light of anthropogenic activities (or lack thereof) in the regions visited by the penguins as well as the potential consequences of Tawaki pre-moult dispersal for the species’ breeding distribution on the New Zealand mainland."
https://openalex.org/W2889096098,"The aim of the present study was to compare swimming performances of successful finishers of the 'Triple Crown of Open Water Swimming' from 1875 to 2017, assessing the effects of sex, the place of event and the nationality of swimmers. Data from 535 finishers in 'Catalina Channel Swim', 1,606 finishers in 'English Channel Swim' and 774 finishers in 'Manhattan Island Marathon Swim' were analysed. We performed different analyses and regression model fittings for all swimmers and annual top-5 finishers. Effects (sex, event, time, nationality) and interaction terms (event-time) were examined through a multi-variable spline mixed regression model. Considering all swimmers, we found that (i) women were approximately 0.06 km/h faster than men (p = 0.011) and (ii) Australians were 0.13 km/h faster than Americans (p = 0.004) and Americans were 0.19 km/h faster than British (p<0.001) and 0.21 km/h faster than Canadians (p = 0.015). When considering annual top-5 finishers, we found that (i) women were 0.07 km/h slower than men (p = 0.042) and (ii) Australians were not faster than Americans (p = 0.149) but Americans were 0.21 km/h faster than British (p<0.001). Our findings improved the knowledge about swim performances over time, in the three events, considering the effects of sex and the nationality of swimmers."
https://openalex.org/W2952356255,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that may modulate cortical excitability, metabolite concentration, and human behaviour. The supplementary motor area (SMA) has been largely ignored as a potential target for tDCS neurorehabilitation but is an important region in motor compensation after brain injury with strong efferent connections to the primary motor cortex (M1). The objective of this work was to measure tissue metabolite changes in the human motor cortex immediately following tDCS. We hypothesized that bihemispheric tDCS would change levels of metabolites involved in neuromodulation including N-acetylaspartate (NAA), glutamate (Glu), and creatine (tCr). In this single-blind, randomized, cross-over study, fifteen healthy adults aged 21–60 participated in two 7T MRI sessions, to identify changes in metabolite concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Immediately after 20 minutes of tDCS, there were no significant changes in metabolite levels or metabolite ratios comparing tDCS to sham. However there was a trend toward increased NAA/tCr concentration (p = 0.08) in M1 under the stimulating cathode. There was a strong, positive correlation between the change in the absolute concentration of NAA and the change in the absolute concentration of tCr (p<0.001) suggesting an effect of tDCS. Both NAA and creatine are important markers of neurometabolism. Our findings provide novel insight into the modulation of neural metabolites in the motor cortex immediately following application of bihemispheric tDCS."
https://openalex.org/W2888967128,"Dasypyrum villosum has been used as a valuable gene resource for disease resistances, yield increase and quality improvement in wheat. A novel wheat-D. villosum alien introgression line CD-3 was generated through hybridization between the common wheat Chinese Spring (CS) and a CS- D. villosum 3V addition line having considerably high stripe rust resistance, which enable the characterization of a potential new stripe rust resistance gene (s) derived from D. villosum. The results of non-denaturing fluorescent in situ hybridization (ND-FISH) showed that CD-3 contained 42 chromosomes, including a 3V chromosome pair, and the absence of both of the 3D chromosomes. PCR-based Landmark Unique Gene (PLUG) molecular marker analysis supported results from the FISH analysis, revealing CD-3 was a wheat-D. villosum 3V (3D) disomic substitution line. Resistant test of stripe rust on 52 plants of F2 generation (CD-3/CS), CD-3, CS and D.villosum have been conducted at seedling stage. 7 plants of F2 generation possessing two 3V chromosomes exhibited high resistance to stripe rust as CD-3 and D.villosum, 10 plants carrying one 3V chromosome and 35 plants without 3V chromosome were susceptive to stripe rust as CS. The result implied the high stripe rust resistance of CD-3 should be controlled by recessive gene(s) originating from D.villosum. To rapidly detect chromosome 3V in the genetic background of wheat, we developed a novel Sequence Characterized Amplified Region (SCAR) marker specific for 3V chromosome based on the sequence of a grain size-related gene DvGS5 in D. villosum, an orthologue of TaGS5 from wheat. The SCAR marker was designated DvGS5-1443, which could successfully amplify a unique 3V-specific fragment in CD-3 and D. villosum, suggesting that this SCAR marker could facilitate targeting the chromosome 3V in the genetic background of wheat for wheat improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2889081988,"Honeybees, Apis mellifera, perform re-orientation flights to learn about the new surroundings of the hive when their hive is transported to a new location. Since the pattern of re-orientation flights has not yet been studied, we asked whether this form of exploratory behavior differs from the well described exploratory orientation flights performed by young honeybees before they start foraging. We also investigated whether the exploratory components of re-orientation flights differ from foraging flights and if so how. We recorded re-orientation flights using harmonic radar technology and compared the patterns and flight parameters of these flights with the first exploratory orientation flights of young honeybees and foraging flights of experienced foragers. Just as exploratory orientation flights of young honeybees, re-orientation flights can be classified into short- and long-range flights, and most short-range re-orientation flights were performed under unfavorable weather conditions. This indicates that bees adapt the flight pattern of their re-orientation and orientation flights to changing weather conditions in a similar way. Unlike exploratory orientation flights, more than one sector of the landscape was explored during a long-range re-orientation flight, and significantly longer flight durations and flight distances were observed. Thus, re-orienting bees explored a larger terrain than bees performing their first exploratory orientation flight. By displacing some bees after their first re-orientation flight, we could demonstrate that a single re-orientation flight seems to be sufficient to learn the new location of the hive. The flight patterns of re-orientation flights differed clearly from those of foraging flights. Thus, re-orientation flights represent a special exploratory behavior that is triggered by a change in the location of the hive."
https://openalex.org/W2888875920,"It was previously shown that the estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer cell line MBA-MD-231 expresses high levels of A2B adenosine receptors as the sole adenosine receptor subtype. These receptors couple to both, stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and a Ca2+ signal. In order to establish a potential role of A2B adenosine receptors in tumor growth and development MAPK signaling was investigated in these breast cancer cells. Although it is known that A2B adenosine receptors may stimulate MAPK it was found that in MBA-MD-231 cells ERK1/2 phosphorylation is reduced upon agonist-stimulation of A2B adenosine receptors. This reduction is also triggered by forskolin, but abolished by the PKA inhibitor H89, suggesting an important role for the cAMP-PKA pathway. Likewise, a role for intracellular Ca2+ was established as the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid, tetraacetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) abolished the reduction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation triggered by A2B stimulation. It was shown that various pathways downstream from A2B adenosine receptors resulted in a stimulation of MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) which dephosphorylates phospho ERK1/2, and thus plays a critical role in the regulation of the phosphorylation state of ERK1/2. The reduction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation mediated by A2B adenosine receptors might provide an interesting approach for adjuvant treatment leading to reduced growth of certain tumors expressing the A2B subtype."
https://openalex.org/W2889108541,"Background Over 18 million adults have initiated life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-poor settings; however, mortality and lost-to-follow-up rates continue to be high among patients in their first year after treatment start. Clinical decision tools are needed to identify patients at high risk for poor outcomes in order to provide individualized risk assessment and intervention. This study aimed to develop and externally validate risk prediction tools that estimate the probability of dying or of being lost to follow-up (LTF) during the year after starting ART. Methods We used a derivation cohort of 7,031 adults age 15–70 years initiating ART from 2007 to 2013 at 6 clinics in Haiti; 242 (3.5%) had documented death and 1,521 (21.6%) were LTF at 1 year after starting ART. The following routinely collected data were used as predictors in two logistic regression models (one to predict death and another to predict LTF): age, gender, weight, CD4 count, WHO Stage, and diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). The validation cohort consisted of 1,835 adults initiating ART at a different HIV clinic in Haiti during 2012. We assessed model discrimination by measuring the C-statistic, and measured model calibration by how closely the predicted probabilities approximated actual probabilities of the two outcomes. We derived a nomogram and a point-based risk score from the predictive models. Findings The model predicting death within the year after starting ART had a C-statistic of 0.75 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.81). There was no evidence for significant overfitting and the predictions were well calibrated. The strongest predictors of 1-year mortality were male gender, low weight, low CD4 count, advanced WHO stage, and the absence of TB. In the validation cohort, the C-statistic was 0.69 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.77). A point-based risk score for death had a C-statistic 0.73 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.76) and categorizes patients as low risk (<2% risk of death), average risk (3–4%), and high-risk (8–10%) and very high-risk (14–19%) with likelihood ratios to be used in settings where the baseline risk is different from our study population. The model predicting LTF did not discriminate well (C-statistic 0.59). Conclusions A simple risk-score using routinely collected data can predict 1-year mortality after ART initiation for HIV-positive adults in Haiti. However, predicting lost to follow-up using routinely collected data was not as successful. The next step is to assess whether use of this risk score can identify patients who need tailored services to reduce mortality in resource-poor settings such as Haiti."
https://openalex.org/W2889221429,"Decades of research have demonstrated that we like people who are more similar to us. The present research tested a potential mechanism for this similarity-liking effect in the domain of politics: the stereotype that people’s political orientation reflects their morals. People believe that Democrats are more likely to endorse individualizing morals like fairness and Republicans are more likely to endorse binding morals like obedience to authority. Prior to the 2016 election, American participants (N = 314) viewed an ostensible Facebook profile that shared an article endorsing conservative ideals (pro-Trump or pro-Republican), or liberal ideals (pro-Clinton or pro-Democrat). Participants rated the favorability of the profile-owner, and completed the Moral Foundations Questionnaire for the profile-owner and themselves. As predicted, participants liked the profile-owner more when they shared political beliefs, and used political stereotypes to infer the moral foundations of the profile-owner. Additionally, the perceived moral foundation endorsement of the profile owner differentially mediated the relationship between the ideology and evaluations of the profile owner based on the party affiliation of the participant: perceived individualizing foundations mediated the relationship for Democratic participants and perceived binding foundations mediated the relationship for Republican participants. In other words, people liked their in-group members more because they thought that the profile-owner endorsed a specific type of morals. In Study 2 (N = 486), we ruled out the potential explanation that any political stereotype can account for the similarity-liking effect, replicating the results of Study 1 even when controlling for perceptions of other personality differences. Taken together, these studies highlight that there may be something unique about the perceived type of morality of political in-group and out-group members that may be contributing to the similarity-liking effect in politics."
https://openalex.org/W2888897486,"Hearing and balance depend upon the precise morphogenesis and mechanosensory function of stereocilia, the specialized structures on the apical surface of sensory hair cells in the inner ear. Previous studies of Grxcr1 mutant mice indicated a critical role for this gene in control of stereocilia dimensions during development. In this study, we analyzed expression of the paralog Grxcr2 in the mouse and evaluated auditory and vestibular function of strains carrying targeted mutations of the gene. Peak expression of Grxcr2 occurs during early postnatal development of the inner ear and GRXCR2 is localized to stereocilia in both the cochlea and in vestibular organs. Homozygous Grxcr2 deletion mutants exhibit significant hearing loss by 3 weeks of age that is associated with developmental defects in stereocilia bundle orientation and organization. Despite these bundle defects, the mechanotransduction apparatus assembles in relatively normal fashion as determined by whole cell electrophysiological evaluation and FM1-43 uptake. Although Grxcr2 mutants do not exhibit overt vestibular dysfunction, evaluation of vestibular evoked potentials revealed subtle defects of the mutants in response to linear accelerations. In addition, reduced Grxcr2 expression in a hypomorphic mutant strain is associated with progressive hearing loss and bundle defects. The stereocilia localization of GRXCR2, together with the bundle pathologies observed in the mutants, indicate that GRXCR2 plays an intrinsic role in bundle orientation, organization, and sensory function in the inner ear during development and at maturity."
https://openalex.org/W2888923620,"In this paper, an image-based waste collection scheduling involving a node with three waste bins is considered. First, the system locates the three bins and determines the waste level of each bin using four Laws Masks and a set of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Next, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used to decide on the number of days remaining before waste is collected from the node. This decision is based on the HMM’s previous state and current observations. The HMM waste collection scheduling seeks to maximize the number of days between collection visits while preventing waste contamination due to late collection. The proposed system was trained using 100 training images and then tested on 100 test images. Each test image contains three bins that might be shifted, rotated, occluded or toppled over. The upright bins could be empty, partially full or full of garbage of various shapes and sizes. The method achieves bin detection, waste level classification and collection day scheduling rates of 100%, 99.8% and 100% respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2889027539,"Background The aim of this study was to estimate the rate and predisposing factors associated with stillbirth in the African Great Lakes region (Burundi, Congo Democratic Republic, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda). Methods and findings Cross-sectional data from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of countries in the African Great Lakes region were used in this study. DHS from Congo Democratic Republic was not included in the analyses because data was not collected for stillbirth in the country survey. A pooled sample of 57046 pregnancies of 7+ months’ duration and 1002 stillbirths were included in the final analysis. The analyses were restricted to stillbirths reported in the 5 years preceding the surveys. Stillbirth was defined as foetal death in the third trimester (≥ 28 weeks’ gestation). Multilevel logistic regression analyses that adjusted for cluster and survey weights were used to determine the factors associated with stillbirth in the Africa Great Lakes region. Health service variables and maternal medical condition variables were not included in the analysis because DHS do not collect data on these variables for pregnancies that did not result in a live birth. Burundi had the highest stillbirth rate per 1000 births [23% (95% CI: 20, 25)] within the region. Factors associated with stillbirth across the region were: no schooling [1.85 (95%Cl: 1.44, 2.38)] and primary education [1.64 (1.32, 2.05)], advanced maternal age [2.39 (95% CI: 1.59, 3.59)], smoking [1.99 (95% CI: 1.19, 3.32)] and drinking water from unimproved sources [1.18 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.37)]. Conclusion To achieve Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) stillbirth target of 12 per 1000 births or less by 2030, policy interventions to prevent stillbirth should focus on promoting community-based socio-educational programmes which encourages a healthy lifestyle especially among uneducated women in the advanced age spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W2889152772,"In this study we examined the genotype distribution of the PPARD rs2267668, rs2016520, and rs1053049 alleles in a group of women, before and after the completion of a 12-week training program. There were two significant genotype × training interactions resulting in decreases of total cholesterol (Chol) through training in rs2267668 G allele carriers and significant increases of triglyceride (TGL) levels in rs2267668 AA homozygotes. Carriers of rs2016520 PPARD C allele exhibited a significant decrease in Chol through training with an accompanying decrease in TGL. There was also overrepresentation of PPARD rs1053049 TT homozygotes in the group with higher post-training TGL levels. Moreover (rs2267668/rs2016520/rs1053049) G/C/T haplotype displayed smaller post-training body mass decrease, suggesting that harboring this specific G/C/T haplotype is unfavorable for achieving the desired training-induced body mass changes. On the other hand, the G/C/C haplotype was significantly associated with post-training increase in fat free mass (FFM) and with lower levels of Chol as well as TGL as observed in the blood of the participants in response to applied training. This observation constitutes the second important finding of the study, implying that when specific training-induced biochemical changes are taken into account, some individuals may benefit from carrying the G/C/C haplotype."

Energy deposition and its nm-scale spatial arrangement in the irradiation by electrons, protons, and heavy ions (4He to 81Br) in an NE-102A scintillator were simulated by a track-structure simulation code. The spatial arrangements of the excited molecules emitting scintillation light and those dissipating the excitation energy were then obtained to calculate the strength of the quenching effect. Light emission from the excited molecules was integrated to finally obtain the observable light yield. The calculated light yields are in good agreement with the earlier measurement data. Moreover, in the case of low-LET particle incidence, a statistical micro-dosimetric model can substitute the track-structure simulation code for reproducing the light yield."
https://openalex.org/W2889497123,"Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite widely distributed in animals and humans. Infection of host cells and parasite proliferation are essential steps in Toxoplasma pathology. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a novel automatic High Content Imaging (HCI) assay to study T. gondii infection and proliferation. We tested various fluorescent markers and strategies of image analysis to obtain an automated method providing results comparable to those from gold standard infection and proliferation assays. No significant difference was observed between the results obtained from the HCI assay and the standard assays (manual fluorescence microscopy and incorporation of [3H]-uracil). We developed here a robust and time-saving assay. This automated technology was then used to screen a library of compounds belonging to four classes of either natural compounds or synthetic derivatives. Inhibition of parasite proliferation and host cell toxicity were measured in the same assay and led to the identification of one hit, a thiosemicarbazone that allows important inhibition of Toxoplasma proliferation while being relatively safe for the host cells."
https://openalex.org/W2888905827,"Gene expression profiling using transcriptional drug perturbations are useful for many biomedical discovery studies including drug repurposing and elucidation of drug mechanisms (MoA) and many other pharmacogenomic applications. However, limited data availability across cell types has severely hindered our capacity to progress in these areas. To fill this gap, recently, the LINCS program generated almost 1.3 million profiles for over 40,000 drug and genetic perturbations for over 70 different human cell types, including meta information about the experimental conditions and cell lines. Unfortunately, Big Data like the ones generated from the ongoing LINCS program do not enable easy insights from the data but possess considerable challenges toward their analysis. In this paper, we address some of these challenges. Specifically, first, we study the gene expression signature profiles from all cell lines and their perturbagents in order to obtain insights in the distributional characteristics of available conditions. Second, we investigate the differential expression of genes for all cell lines obtaining an understanding of condition dependent differential expression manifesting the biological complexity of perturbagents. As a result, our analysis helps the experimental design of follow-up studies, e.g., by selecting appropriate cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2889057839,"Despite its well-known antithrombotic properties, the effect of aspirin on blood pressure (BP) and hypertension pathology is unclear. The hugely varying doses used clinically have contributed to this confusion, with high-dose aspirin still commonly used due to concerns about the efficacy of low-dose aspirin. Because prostaglandins have been shown to both promote and inhibit T-cell activation, we also explored the immunomodulatory properties of aspirin in hypertension. Although the common preclinical high dose of 100 mg/kg/d improved vascular dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy, this effect was accompanied by indices of elevated adaptive immunity, renal T-cell infiltration, renal fibrosis, and BP elevation in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats and in angiotensin II-induced hypertensive mice. The cardioprotective effects of aspirin were conserved with a lower dose (10 mg/kg/d) while circumventing heightened adaptive immunity and elevated BP. We also show that low-dose aspirin improves renal fibrosis. Differential inhibition of the COX-2 isoform may underlie the disparate effects of the 2 doses. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of low-dose aspirin in treating a vast array of cardiovascular parameters and suggest modulation of adaptive immunity as a novel mechanism underlying adverse cardiovascular profiles associated with COX-2 inhibitors. Clinical studies should identify the dose of aspirin that achieves maximal cardioprotection with a new awareness that higher doses of aspirin could trigger undesired autoimmunity in hypertensive individuals. This work also warrants an evaluation of high-dose aspirin and COX-2 inhibitor therapy in sufferers of inflammatory conditions who are already at increased risk for cardiovascular disease.—Khan, S.

https://openalex.org/W2889380914,"Mycoplasma gallisepticum is a serious pathogen for poultry that causes chronic respiratory disease in chickens. Increased embryonic mortality, as well as reduced weight gain and egg production have been found in infected chickens, which can lead to considerable economic losses in poultry production. Increased antibiotic resistance compromises the use of tetracyclines, macrolides and quinolones in the farm environment. In the present study, danofloxacin concentrations were simulated below the MIC99, between the MIC99 and MPC (the mutant prevention concentration), and above the MPC in an in vitro dynamic model against M. gallisepticum. The relationship between the simulated danofloxacin pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) parameters and development of resistance for M. gallisepticum was explored based on the available data obtained from various dosing regimens in the in vitro model. Danofloxacin concentration, counts of viable cell and susceptibility were determined during the experiment. The mutations in gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE as well as efflux pumps were examined. The MIC of danofloxacin against M. gallisepticum was increased when drug concentrations were between the lower and upper boundaries of the mutant selection window. The upper boundary of the selection window in vitro was estimated as a Cmax/MPC value of 1. The lower boundary was estimated as Cmax/MPC value of 0.05. Both in terms of the MIC and resistance frequency, M. gallisepticum resistance was developed when danofloxacin concentrations fell inside the mutant selection window (ratios of Cmax to MPC between 0.05 and 1). The single mutation in gyrA (Ser-83→Arg) was found in all mutants, while double mutations in gyrA and parC (Ala-64→Ser) were observed only in the mutant with the highest MIC. In addition, no change of susceptibility in the mutants was observed in the presence of reserpine and carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). This suggested that ATP-binding cassette superfamily (ABC transporter) and major facilitator superfamily (MFS transporter) did not play a role in danofloxacin efflux."
https://openalex.org/W2889453914,"When predators are removed or suppressed for generations, prey populations tend to increase and when predators are re-introduced, prey densities should fall back to pre-control levels. In cases of apparent competition where there are alternate abundant and rare prey species, rare species may decline further than expected or disappear altogether. Recently, concern about the impact of recovering predator populations on wildlife in Laikipia County, Kenya, has led to questions of whether lions (Panthera leo, IUCN Red List Vulnerable) exert top-down pressure on Grevy’s zebra (Equus grevyi, IUCN Red List Endangered). We examined effects of lion predation on Plain’s zebra (E. quagga, IUCN Red List Near Threatened) and Grevy’s zebra populations in a 2,105 km2 area defined by lion movements. We used line transect surveys to estimate density of Grevy’s (0.71/km2) and Plain’s (15.9/km2) zebras, and satellite telemetry to measure movements for lions and both zebras. We tracked lions to potential feeding sites to estimate predation rates on zebras. We compared field-based estimates of predation rates on both zebras to random gas models of encounters that result in predation to ask if lions prey preferentially on Grevy’s zebra at a sufficient rate to drive population declines. Lions preyed on Grevy’s zebra significantly less than expected in 15 of 16 (94%) scenarios considered and lions preyed on Plain’s zebras as expected or significantly less than expected in 15 of 16 scenarios. Population trend of Grevy’s zebra indicates that the Kenya population may be stabilizing. Recruitment rate to the population has tripled since 2004, making it unlikely that lions are having an impact on Grevy’s zebras. In Laikipia County, competitive displacement by livestock (Livestock: Grevy’s zebra ratio = 864:1) and interference competition for grass with Plain’s zebra (Plain’s zebra:Grevy’s zebra ratio = 22:1) are most likely the predominant threats to Grevy’s Zebra recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2888994038,"The number of visible ovarian antral follicles (antral follicle count-AFC) is repeatable in bovine individuals, but highly variable between animals, and with differences between Bos taurus and Bos indicus breeds. Several studies have tried to determine the correlation between AFC and increased fertility in cattle. While the impacts of AFC on embryo production, hormonal levels, and pregnancy rates have been described, the molecular effects of AFC on bovine oviducts have not yet been investigated. Here, the aim was to investigate the impact of breeds, such as Aberdeen Angus and Nelore heifer with high or low AFC, on abundance of transcripts and protein related to oviductal transport, sperm reservoir formation, monospermy control, and gamete interaction in the oviducts. In summary, the ovulation side was the major factor that affected transcript abundance on bovine oviducts. However, a discreet effect among AFC and cattle breeds was also observed. Based on this, we concluded and reinforced here that differential microenvironments between ipsilateral and contralateral oviducts have a major effect on modulating the transcripts related to oviductal transport, sperm reservoir formation, monospermy control, and gamete interaction. However, we cannot exclude that there is minimal effect of AFC or breed on regulation of some genes (such as AGTR1, ACE1, FUCA1, and VEGFA) in bovine oviducts."
https://openalex.org/W2889159032,"The application of appropriate animal models and techniques for the study of osteoporosis is important. Lanyu pigs, a local miniature breed, have been widely used in various biomedical studies in Taiwan. This study aimed to induce bone loss in Lanyu pigs and to examine whether porcine induced pluripotent stem cell (piPSC)-derived osteoblast-like cells could recover bone mass of tibiae via local cell transplantation. piPSCs were directed to differentiate into osteoblast-like cells using osteogenic medium, and differentiated cells expressed osteogenic markers and phenotypes. Twenty mature female Lanyu pigs were divided into four groups, including control (C, 1% calcium diet), treatment 1 (T1, ovariectomy + 1% calcium diet), treatment 2 (T2, ovariectomy + 0.5% calcium diet), and treatment 3 (T3, ovariectomy + 0.5% calcium diet + 1 mg/kg of prednisolone) and were subjected to bone loss induction for twelve months. Micro-CT images revealed that the lowest trabecular bone parameters, such as trabecular bone volume, thickness, separation, number, and total porosity, were detected in the T3 group. The lowest proportions of cortical bone in the proximal metaphysis, proximal diaphysis, and distal diaphysis were also found in the T3 group. These results indicate that ovariectomy, calcium restriction, and prednisolone administration can be applied to induce proper bone loss in Lanyu pigs. After bone loss induction, pigs were subjected to cell transplantation in the left tibiae and were maintained for another six months. Results showed that transplanted piPSC-derived osteoblast-like cells significantly improved trabecular bone structures at transplanted sites and maintained cortical bone structures in the proximal metaphysis. In conclusion, the therapeutic potential of piPSC-derived osteoblast-like cells was confirmed via cell transplantation in the left tibiae of Lanyu pigs. These findings reveal the therapeutic potential of piPSCs for glucocorticoid-induced bone loss in pig models."
https://openalex.org/W2809995848,"Many bird species produce temporally coordinated duets and choruses, requiring the rapid integration of auditory perception and motor production. While males and females of some species are known to participate in these displays for sex-specific purposes, few studies have identified perceptual features that trigger sex-specific contributions of coordinated song. Especially little is known about perception and production in duetting suboscine passerines, which are thought to have innate songs and largely static, rather than dynamic, vocal behavior. Here, we used synthetic stimuli in a playback experiment on chestnut-backed antbirds (Myrmeciza exsul) to (1) test whether differences in song frequency (Hz) can trigger sex-specific vocal behavior in a suboscine passerine (2) test for the functions of duetting in males and females of this species, and (3) determine whether these suboscines can dynamically adjust the temporal and spectral features of their songs. We found sex-specific responses to synthetic playback manipulated in song frequency (Hz), providing evidence that in this context males sing in duets for general territory defense and females join in for mate guarding purposes. In addition, we found that the birds altered the frequency, duration, and timing of their songs depending on the frequency of the playback songs. Thus, we show that these birds integrate spectral and temporal information about conspecific songs and actively modulate their responses in sex-specific ways."
https://openalex.org/W2888869512,"There are many possible strategies to promote naturalization in anthropogenic landscapes to mitigate global change effects. We combined large-scale databases available for continental Spain on: (1) distribution of breeding birds, (2) forest inventory stands, (3) land-use cover, (4) 18 global climate models recently developed at local scales, and (5) historical and genetically-based information on the distribution of natural versus planted pine forests, to analyze whether back to nature strategies may help to mitigate biodiversity loss due to climate change. We performed the analysis along environmental and ecological gradients of pine forests in Southern Europe. Models suggested that, naturalization strategies, in this case defined by the replacement of planted pine forests and eucalyptus forests by natural pine forests, could help to mitigate the expected loss of bird diversity due to climate change, but that mitigation efficiency will vary along environmental and ecological gradients. Maximum levels of diversity mitigation were predicted at intermediate levels of naturalization, with lower bird richness in areas where all pine forests were either planted or naturalized. Efficiency also varied spatially, given that both cold- and hot-spots of climate-driven bird diversity loss were identified. Transforming planted forest into natural forest is not a mitigation panacea, and additional regionally-adapted strategies may be identified to mitigate the expected biodiversity loss in forest ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2270538186,"Group cooperation is fundamental to human society. The public goods game is often used to describe the difficulty of group cooperation. However, there are other structures of institutions to maintain group cooperation such as Rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs). ROSCAs are informal financial institutions that exist worldwide, in which all participants contribute to a common fund and take turns to receive a return. ROSCAs are common in developing countries and among migrant groups in developed countries. There are various types of ROSCAs, and they share a crucial problem in that participants whose turn to receive a return has passed have an incentive to default on their contributions. We conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the mechanisms that can prevent default in a fixed ROSCA, in which the order of receipt of returns is determined before starting and is also known to members. The findings are as follows. (i) Excluding low contributors from ROSCA groups by voting increased contribution rates both before and after the receipt of returns. (ii) ROSCA members exhibited reciprocity and a sense of revenge: that is, members contributed to the returns payments of other members who had contributed to them, and did not contribute to the returns payments of non-contributors. Voluntary behaviors thus sustained ROSCAs. Meanwhile, an exogenous punishment whereby subjects were prevented from receiving returns payments unless they had themselves contributed previously did not increase contribution rates."
https://openalex.org/W2889132114,"The sensitivity of the double agar gel immunodiffusion test is about 90% in patients with untreated paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), but it is much lower in cases of relapse. In addition, serum from patients with PCM caused by Paracoccidioides lutzii, frequent in the Midwest region of Brazil, do not react with the classical antigen obtained from Pb B-339. These findings showed the need for alternative diagnostic methods, such as biological markers through proteomics. The aim of this study was to identify biomarkers for the safe identification of PCM relapse and specific proteins that could distinguish infections caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis from those produced by Paracoccidioides lutzii. Proteomic analysis was performed in serum from 9 patients with PCM caused by P. brasiliensis, with and without relapse, from 4 patients with PCM produced by P. lutzii, and from 3 healthy controls. The comparative evaluation of the 29 identified plasma proteins suggested that the presence of the immunoglobulin (Ig) alpha-2 chain C region and the absence of Ig heavy chain V-III TIL indicate infection by P. lutzii. In addition, the absence of complement factor B protein might be a predictor of relapse. The evaluation of these proteins in a higher number of patients should be carried out in order to validate these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2889533612,"Sleep's relevance for long-term social functioning in psychiatric disorders has been widely overlooked so far. Here, we investigate social functioning in a transdiagnostic sample of 31 patients with severe mental illness, namely schizophrenia (n = 15) or major depression (n = 16), in relation to their polysomnographic sleep characteristics 6 (± 2.4) years earlier. In addition, cognitive performance at follow-up and clinical characteristics (i.e., severity of disorder-related symptoms and number of hospitalizations between baseline and follow-up) are assessed. Multiple regression analysis results in a model with slow-wave sleep (SWS) and number of hospitalizations as significant predictors accounting for 50% (R2 = 0.507; p <0.001) of the variance in social functioning. SWS remains a significant predictor of long-term social functioning throughout a series of refining analyses which also identify baseline functioning as an additional significant predictor, whereas diagnosis is non-significant. Also, the effect of SWS on social functioning is not mediated by number of hospitalizations as assessed by a bootstrapped mediation analysis. We thus conclude that duration of slow-wave sleep is a powerful predictor of long-term social outcome in psychiatric disorders. Also, we discuss the relevance of verbal memory, symptom severity, and diagnostic category for social functioning. Future studies should test this finding by using a prospective design, a bigger sample, optimized predictor variables, and a more diverse set of diagnoses. Moreover, it should be explored whether or not treating sleep disturbances in psychiatric illnesses independently improves long-term social functioning."
https://openalex.org/W2888880249,"Tie strength and tags have been separately suggested as possible attributes for photo access controls in Social Network Services. However, an evaluation is missing about the benefits/drawbacks of adding one or both of these attributes to the ones already used in access controls for Social Network Services (groups and individuals). In this paper, we describe an experiment with 48 participants using access controls that include tie strength and tags (separately and simultaneously) together with attributes for groups and individuals. We analyze the results using several quantitative and qualitative metrics. We find that users consider these two new attributes useful in defining their sharing policies, and they prefer to employ access controls that consider tags and tie strength jointly. Specifically, users believe that tie strength improves policy understandability and that tags help them define sharing policies faster. However, we also observe that when users employ these two attributes they tend to make more mistakes in terms of the resulting sharing policy. We hypothesize that this could be caused by the lack of experience using tie strength and tags in access controls."

https://openalex.org/W2889318406,"In human groups that seek to synchronize to a common steady beat, every member can typically perceive every other member. We question whether this naturally occurring all-sense-all condition is optimal for temporal coordination. We consider alternative configurations represented by directed graphs, in which individuals can only hear or see a subset of others. We identify a trade-off in the topology of such networks: While denser graphs provide stronger coupling, improving synchrony, density increases sensitivity to early taps, which produces rushing. Results from an experimental study with music conservatory students show that networks that combine short path length with low density match all-sense-all networks in synchrony while yielding a steadier beat. These findings suggest that professional teams in arts, sports, industry, and the military may improve temporal coordination by employing technology that strategically configures who can track whom."
https://openalex.org/W2951337539,"Objective To identify in vitro inhibitors of xanthine crystallization that have potential for inhibiting the formation of xanthine crystals in urine and preventing the development of the renal calculi in patients with xanthinuria. Methods The formation of xanthine crystals in synthetic urine and the effects of 10 potential crystallization inhibitors were assessed using a kinetic turbidimetric system with a photometer. The maximum concentration tested for each compound was: 20 mg/L for 3-methylxanthine (3-MX); 40 mg/L for 7-methylxanthine (7-MX), 1-methylxanthine (1-MX), theobromine (TB), theophylline, paraxanthine, and caffeine; 45 mg/L for 1-methyluric acid; 80 mg/L for 1,3-dimethyluric acid; and 200 mg/L for hypoxanthine. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the morphology of the crystals formed when inhibitory effects were observed. Results Only 7-MX, 3-MX, and 1-MX significantly inhibited xanthine crystallization at the tested concentrations. Mixtures of inhibitors had an additive effect rather than a synergistic effect on crystallization. Conclusion Two of the inhibitors identified here—7-MX and 3-MX—are major metabolites of TB. In particular, after TB consumption, 20% is excreted in the urine as TB, 21.5% as 3-MX, and 36% as 7-MX. Thus, consumption of theobromine could protect patients with xanthinuria from the development of renal xanthine calculi. Clinical trials are necessary to demonstrate these effects in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2888991491,"Early detection of cystitis in equine is essential to improve the prognosis and outcome of therapy. However, the conventional white light endoscopy is not sufficiently accurate for this purpose. Hence, this study evaluated chromoendoscopy as a recent diagnostic tool for cystitis in female donkeys. For this purpose, 5 apparently normal donkeys (control group) and 5 female donkeys with cystitis (diseased group) were used. Physical and rectal examinations, urine analysis, white light cystoscopy, methylene blue-based chromoendoscopy and histopathology were performed in all animals. Turbid urine exhibiting an alkaline pH and a significant (P = .02) increase in the numbers of RBCs and WBCs was observed in the diseased group compared to the control one. In the control group, white light cystoscopy showed a smooth pale pink glistening mucosa with two openings of the ureters and visible submucosal blood vessels. During chromocystoscopy, faint bluish discoloration of the mucosal surface with clearly visible submucosal blood vessels was detectable. These findings were correlated with the histopathological findings of the biopsies collected from the urinary bladder. In the diseased group, white-light cystoscopy showed clearly visible blood vessels, mildly hyperaemic mucosa in focal or diffuse forms and small vesicle formation. Chromocystoscopy revealed dark bluish oedematous and irregular mucosa either in a focal form or a diffuse form (marbled appearance) with deeply stained submucosal blood vessels. Histopathologically, the urothelium was hyperplastic with squamous metaplasia and the lamina propria was infiltrated with few leukocytes and congested blood vessels. Small bluish dots representing the absorbed methylene blue dye were seen in the inflamed areas against the lightly stained mucosa of the bladder. Severe diffuse necrotic cystitis was also seen with bacterial aggregations on the surface. Gram's staining revealed both gram positive bacilli and Gram positive coccobacilli. In conclusion, chromoendoscopy is a helpful tool for early diagnosis of cystitis in female donkeys and enables targeted biopsies, which improves the prognosis and outcome of therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2889215686,This paper assesses the extent to which patent renewal data is associated with government funding in a university context by focusing on the relationship between the funded patentees and renewal decisions of their patents. The aim of this paper is to show whether receiving funding from government contributes to high-value patents as measured by the patent renewal decisions made by their owners. Our observations of academic nanotechnology patents in Canada discovered a positive relationship between funded researchers and the rate of patent renewal after 4 years. Further analysis is also undertaken into the relative impact on patent renewal after 8 years and 12 years. Our results suggest that the length of patent renewal in numbers of years can be related to levels of government funding received by their inventors.
https://openalex.org/W2889398116,"The retinal rod pathway, featuring dedicated rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and AII amacrine cells, has been intensely studied in placental mammals. Here, we analyzed the rod pathway in a nocturnal marsupial, the South American opossum Monodelphis domestica to elucidate whether marsupials have a similar rod pathway. The retina was dominated by rods with densities of 338,000-413,000/mm². Immunohistochemistry for the RBC-specific marker protein kinase Cα (PKCα) and the AII cell marker calretinin revealed the presence of both cell types with their typical morphology. This is the first demonstration of RBCs in a marsupial and of the integration of RBCs and AII cells in the rod signaling pathway. Electron microscopy showed invaginating synaptic contacts of the PKCα-immunoreactive bipolar cells with rods; light microscopic co-immunolabeling for the synaptic ribbon marker CtBP2 confirmed dominant rod contacts. The RBC axon terminals were mostly located in the innermost stratum S5 of the inner plexiform layer (IPL), but had additional side branches and synaptic varicosities in strata S3 and S4, with S3-S5 belonging to the presumed functional ON sublayer of the IPL, as shown by immunolabeling for the ON bipolar cell marker Gγ13. Triple-immunolabeling for PKCα, calretinin and CtBP2 demonstrated RBC synapses onto AII cells. These features conform to the pattern seen in placental mammals, indicating a basically similar rod pathway in M. domestica. The density range of RBCs was 9,900-16,600/mm2, that of AII cells was 1,500-3,260/mm2. The numerical convergence (density ratio) of 146-156 rods to 4.7-6.0 RBCs to 1 AII cell is within the broad range found among placental mammals. For comparison, we collected data for the Australian nocturnal dunnart Sminthopsis crassicaudata, and found it to be similar to M. domestica, with rod-contacting PKCα-immunoreactive bipolar cells that had axon terminals also stratifying in IPL strata S3-S5."
https://openalex.org/W2978188190,"Over the last decades, predictive microbiology has made significant advances in the mathematical description of microbial spoiler and pathogen dynamics in or on food products. Recently, the focus of predictive microbiology has shifted from a (semi-)empirical population-level approach towards mechanistic models including information about the intracellular metabolism in order to increase model accuracy and genericness. However, incorporation of this subpopulation-level information increases model complexity and, consequently, the required run time to simulate microbial cell and population dynamics. In this paper, results of metabolic flux balance analyses (FBA) with a genome-scale model are used to calibrate a low-complexity linear model describing the microbial growth and metabolite secretion rates of Escherichia coli as a function of the nutrient and oxygen uptake rate. Hence, the required information about the cellular metabolism (i.e., biomass growth and secretion of cell products) is selected and included in the linear model without incorporating the complete intracellular reaction network. However, the applied FBAs are only representative for microbial dynamics under specific extracellular conditions, viz., a neutral medium without weak acids at a temperature of 37℃. Deviations from these reference conditions lead to metabolic shifts and adjustments of the cellular nutrient uptake or maintenance requirements. This metabolic dependency on extracellular conditions has been taken into account in our low-complex metabolic model. In this way, a novel approach is developed to take the synergistic effects of temperature, pH, and undissociated acids on the cell metabolism into account. Consequently, the developed model is deployable as a tool to describe, predict and control E. coli dynamics in and on food products under various combinations of environmental conditions. To emphasize this point,three specific scenarios are elaborated: (i) aerobic respiration without production of weak acid extracellular metabolites, (ii) anaerobic fermentation with secretion of mixed acid fermentation products into the food environment, and (iii) respiro-fermentative metabolic regimes in between the behaviors at aerobic and anaerobic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2888930614,"Approaches to identify the perception of tinnitus in various animal models have been difficult to apply to mouse. As a result, mice have been underutilized to investigate the cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms underlying tinnitus. A recent study in guinea pigs identified a novel spontaneous behavior (unconditioned response), changes in movement during silent gaps, that identified a subgroup of animals presumably with tinnitus. Guinea pigs identified with tinnitus failed to “freeze” in response to silent gaps in sound. In the hope of developing a rapid and reliable assay for mice, we used a similar approach. C57BL/6J mice underwent three trials in which spontaneous movement was video recorded in the presence of white noise interrupted with six silent gaps. Movement metrics included velocity and body movement. Before the third trial, mice underwent either sham or noise exposure to induce hearing loss and tinnitus. Auditory brainstem responses before and after noise trauma confirmed normal hearing in sham-treated animals and hearing loss in the noise-exposed cohort. No differences in the various movement metrics were detected during the silent gaps either before or after sham/noise exposure. Variability in spontaneous movement both before and after sham/noise exposure was substantially greater in mice compared to guinea pigs. Thus, this assay is not sufficiently statistically powerful to identify changes in movement that might indicate tinnitus perception in mice. Previous observations also reported increased movement overall in guinea pigs identified as suffering tinnitus. In contrast, mice showed no statistically significant differences in movement between the three trials. Despite our results, other unconditioned (as well as conditioned) behaviors should be examined in mice to test their utility to detect changes that indicate the perception of tinnitus. Such assays are essential to accelerate the use of mouse models in tinnitus research."

In this study, we investigate the associations between smoking and obesity prior to a breast cancer diagnosis and the presence of lymph node metastases at diagnosis. Methods Women with stage I-III breast cancer (n = 3,304) were identified from the National Cancer Institute’s Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Univariable and multivariable log-binomial models were used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between lymph node positive breast cancer and; i) smoking, and ii) obesity prior to diagnosis. Results Pre-diagnostic smoking/obesity was not associated with lymph node metastasis at diagnosis in multivariable analyses; (RR 0.82, 95%CI 0.61, 1.10) and (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81, 1.12), respectively. Conclusion Obesity and smoking information was recorded a number of years prior to breast cancer diagnosis, therefore these findings should to be replicated in a larger cohort of women, with more detailed smoking and obesity information."
https://openalex.org/W2889535413,"Microsimulations are increasingly used to estimate the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). These models consist of agents which represent a sexually active population. Matching agents into sexual relationships is computationally intensive and presents modellers with difficult design decisions: how to select which partnerships between agents break up, which agents enter a partnership market, and how to pair agents in the partnership market. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of these design decisions on STI prevalence. We compared two strategies for selecting which agents enter a daily partnership market and which agent partnerships break up: random selection in which agents are treated homogenously versus selection based on data from a large German longitudinal data set that accounts for sex, sexual orientation and age heterogeneity. We also coupled each of these strategies with one of several recently described algorithms for pairing agents and compared their speed and outcomes. Additional design choices were also considered, such as the number of agents used in the model, increasing the heterogeneity of agents' sexual behaviour, and the proportion of relationships which are casual sex encounters. Approaches which account for agent heterogeneity estimated lower prevalence than less sophisticated approaches which treat agents homogeneously. Also, in simulations with non-random pairing of agents, as the risk of infection increased, incidence declined as the number of agents increased. Our algorithms facilitate the execution of thousands of simulations with large numbers of agents quickly. Fast pair-matching algorithms provide a practical way for microsimulation modellers to account for varying sexual behaviour within the population they are studying. For STIs with high infection rates modellers may need to experiment with different population sizes."
https://openalex.org/W2888816930,"Building predictive sensors is of paramount importance in science. Can we make a randomly wired sensor “good enough” at predicting its input simply by making it larger? We show that infinitely large, randomly wired sensors are nonspecific for their input, and therefore nonpredictive of future input, unless they are close to deterministic. Nearly deterministic, randomly wired sensors can capture ∼ 10% of the predictive information of their inputs for “typical” environments."
