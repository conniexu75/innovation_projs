However, the exact roles of TRAF2 and TRAF5 in TNF-induced NF-κB activation still remain controversial. To address this issue, we generated TRAF2 and TRAF5 double knockout (DKO) mice. TNF- but not interleukin-1-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB was severely impaired in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from DKO mice. Moreover, DKO MEFs were more susceptible to TNF-induced cytotoxicity than TRAF2 knockout MEFs. Collectively, these results indicate that both TRAF2 and TRAF5 are involved in TNF-induced NF-κB activation and protection from cell death.

Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 45: 491-503Google Scholar). Although such pleiotropic effects are mediated by two cognate TNF receptors, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2, TNF-induced cell death is mediated mainly by TNF-R1. In response to TNF, TNF-R1 is trimerized and recruits an adapter molecule, TRADD (2Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). In the apoptotic signaling pathway, the recruited TRADD interacts with FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein) (2Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar), which then recruits and activates caspase-8. The activated caspase-8 in turn activates effector caspases, such as caspase-3 and -7, resulting in apoptosis (3Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4559) Google Scholar). On the other hand, recruited TRADD also interacts with RIP and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), both of which are implicated in NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation (4Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar, 5Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a transcriptional factor that regulates expression of various inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules (6Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4284) Google Scholar). NF-κB is activated by inflammatory cytokines and cellular stresses including TNF, IL-1, lipopolysaccharide, UV, or γ-irradiation. In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by binding to IκB inhibitory proteins (7Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, N-terminal serine residues of IκBs are phosphorylated, which leads to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via a 26-S proteasome pathway (8Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). Then the liberated NF-κB from IκBs translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of various target genes. Recently, the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which is responsible for this inducible phosphorylation, was identified and extensively characterized (9Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4086) Google Scholar). The IKK complex is composed of three subunits, including two structurally related kinases, designated IKKα and IKKβ, and one adapter molecule, designated IKKγ or NEMO (9Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4086) Google Scholar). Gene-targeting studies showed essential roles of IKKβ and IKKγ/NEMO in cytokine-induced NF-κB activation (10Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 11Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J.

These studies also demonstrated a critical role of NF-κB in the protection of cells from TNF-induced cell death, although the molecular mechanism is not completely understood. The TRAFs were identified originally as signal-transducing molecules for the TNF-R and the IL-1 receptor superfamilies (16Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 17Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Ex vivo data demonstrated that TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 activate NF-κB and are involved in NF-κB activation through these receptors (16Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 17Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that TRAFs interact with NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), MAP kinase/ERK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), transforming growth factor β-activated kinase, or atypical protein kinase C, and these kinases phosphorylate IKKs resulting in NF-κB activation (18Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 19Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M.

However, the exact contribution of these kinases to cytokine-induced NF-κB activation is not yet clear. So far, RIP and TRAF6 have been shown to play essential roles in TNF- and IL-1/lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-κB activation, respectively (22Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 23Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.C. Sarosi I. Duncan G.S. Furlonger C. Ho A. Morony S. Capparelli C. Van G.

Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In contrast, TRAF2- or TRAF5-deficient mice did not show substantial defects in TNF-induced NF-κB activation (25Yeh W.-C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W.

A. 1999; 96: 9803-9808Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), suggesting that TRAF2 and TRAF5 are not essential or play a redundant role in TNF-induced NF-κB activation. To further examine the contribution of TRAF2 and TRAF5 to TNF-induced NF-κB activation, we generated TRAF2 and TRAF5 double knockout (DKO) mice and characterized the response to TNF. We found redundant or nonredundant roles for TRAF2 and TRAF5 in TNF-induced NF-κB activation, JNK activation, and protection from cell death. Recombinant human TNF, murine TNF, and murine IL-1β were purchased from BD PharMingen. Anti-HA (12CA5) and anti-Flag (M2) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Sigma, respectively. Anti-Myc mAb (9E10) was obtained from ATCC. Anti-RIP mAb was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-IKKα, anti-JNK1, and anti-IκBα antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. HEK293 cells and murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. pcDNA3-HA-TRAF2, pRK5-Flag-RIP, and pRK5-Myc-TRADD were described previously (5Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 27Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19935-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Human TRAF5 was subcloned into pCR-HA vector, designated pCR-HA-TRAF5. To maximize the yield of double mutant mice, we first generated traf2+/−traf5−/− andtraf2+/−traf5+/− mice by crossingtraf2+/− and traf5−/− mice. We then crossed traf2+/−traf5+/− andtraf2+/−traf5−/− mice to generatetraf2−/−traf5−/−mice. Genotypic analysis of these mice was performed as described previously (25Yeh W.-C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed essentially as described previously (28Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbot L. Ware C.F. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Briefly, MEFs (1 × 106) were stimulated with murine TNF (10 ng/ml) or IL-1β (10 ng/nl) for the indicated time periods. Then, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested. The cells were treated with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the nuclear extracts were prepared. The nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated with a 32P-labeled NF-κB-specific oligonucleotide probe containing two tandemly positioned NF-κB-binding sites from the HIV-1 enhancer. Reactions were subjected to 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed on a Fuji BAS2500 image analyzer. In vitro kinase assay was performed essentially as described previously (29Nakano H. Shindo M. Sakon S. Nishinaka S. Mihara M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Briefly, MEFs (4 × 106 for IKK assay; 1 × 106 for JNK assay) were plated in 150- or 100-mm dishes. Then the cells were stimulated with murine TNF (10 ng/ml) or IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for the various times, and the reaction was stopped with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of a lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm NaF. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKγ/NEMO antibody (30Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar) or anti-JNK1 antibody and protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the lysis buffer and twice with the kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The immunoprecipitates were then incubated with 1 μg of GST-IκBα (1) for IKK assay or GST-c-Jun-(1–79) for JNK assay and [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi) in the kinase buffer for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer. The eluted proteins were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the autoradiograms were visualized on an image analyzer (Fujix, BAS2500). In all cases expression of IKKα, RIP, or JNK1 was verified by immunoblotting of aliquots of the cell lysates as described below. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (31Akiba H. Nakano H. Nishinaka S. Shindo M. Kobata T. Morimoto C. Ware C.F. Malinin N.L. Wallach D. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13353-13358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293 cells (4 × 106) were transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed in a lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Then, one-half of the lysates was immunoprecipitated with control IgG, anti-Flag mAb, or anti-Myc mAb followed by the addition of 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose. The precipitates were washed with lysis buffer, and the eluates were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-HA mAb followed by avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (Vectastain). The signal was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting Detection System Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Expression of the transfected proteins was verified by subjecting aliquots of total lysates to immunoblotting with the indicated anti-tag mAbs. MEFs (5 × 103/well) were plated onto 96-well plates and cultured for 12 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Then the cells were incubated with various amounts of murine TNF in the presence or absence of 0.25 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX, Sigma) for 24 h. Cell viability was determined by WST assay using a cell counting kit (Dojindo). Taken that the cells from traf2−/−(T2KO) ortraf5−/− (T5KO) mice did not show a substantial defect in TNF-induced NF-κB activation (25Yeh W.-C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F.

To explore this possibility, we generated TRAF2 and TRAF5 DKO mice by crossing T2KO and T5KO mice. The percentage of DKO pups at birth was lower than the expected Mendelian ratio, and these pups became runted and died within 2 to 3 weeks. A detailed phenotype of DKO mice will be published elsewhere. To investigate whether NF-κB activation was impaired in DKO mice, we prepared MEFs from E13.5–E14.5 embryos. We first examined nuclear translocation of NF-κB by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As reported previously (25Yeh W.-C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L.

A. 1999; 96: 9803-9808Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), TNF-induced NF-κB translocation was not significantly impaired in either T2KO or T5KO MEFs (Fig. 1A). In contrast, DKO MEFs showed severe impairment of nuclear translocation of NF-κB upon TNF stimulation, whereas upon IL-1 stimulation this was intact (Fig. 1A). These results suggested a redundant role of TRAF2 and TRAF5 in TNF-induced NF-κB activation. Nuclear translocation of NF-κB requires phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBs. We next assessed the kinase activity of IKK to phosphorylate IκBα. Wild-type and DKO MEFs were stimulated with TNF or IL-1 for 10 or 30 min, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKγ/NEMO antibody. The precipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase assay using GST-IκBα as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 1B, phosphorylation of GST-IκBα induced by TNF, but not IL-1, at 10 min was dramatically reduced in DKO MEFs as compared with wild type. The late appearance of the kinase activity at 30 min might explain the residual NF-κB binding activity observed in DKO MEFs. We also examined the degradation of IκBα by Western blotting. In wild-type MEFs, IκBα completely disappeared at 10 min and reappeared at 30 min after TNF stimulation (Fig. 1C). In contrast, IκBα levels were only partially reduced at 10 and 30 min after TNF stimulation in DKO MEFs (Fig.1C). On the other hand, IL-1-induced degradation of IκBα was comparable between wild-type and DKO MEFs. These results suggested that TRAF2 and TRAF5 play a critical role in TNF-induced NF-κB activation by mediating rapid activation of IKK and degradation of IκBα. Previous studies showed a severe impairment of JNK activation by TNF in T2KO MEFs but not T5KO MEFs (25Yeh W.-C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D.

A. 1999; 96: 9803-9808Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We next examined TNF-induced JNK activation in DKO MEFs. MEFs were stimulated with TNF or IL-1 for 10 or 30 min, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK antibody. The precipitates were subject to in vitro kinase assay using GST-c-Jun as a substrate. JNK activation by TNF, but not IL-1, was significantly reduced in T2KO and DKO MEFs as compared with wild-type and T5KO MEFs (Fig. 2). The reduction of JNK activity in T2KO MEFs was almost comparable with that in DKO MEFs, suggesting that TRAF5 does not substantially contribute to TNF-induced JNK activation. To further investigate the molecular mechanism by which TRAF5 is involved in TNF-induced NF-κB activation, we examined whether TRAF5 interacts physically with TNF receptor-associated signaling molecules such as TRADD and RIP (4Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar,5Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V.

Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, 293 cells were transiently transfected with Flag-tagged RIP or Myc-tagged TRADD along with HA-tagged TRAF2 or TRAF5. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag or anti-Myc antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. As reported previously (4Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar, 5Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), TRAF2 was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with RIP and TRADD (Fig. 3). TRAF5 was also co-immunoprecipitated with RIP but not TRADD (Fig. 3). These results suggested that TRAF5 participates in the TNF-induced NF-κB activation via interaction with RIP. We next examined the susceptibility of wild-type, T2KO, T5KO, and DKO MEFs to TNF-induced cell death in the presence or absence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, CHX. As reported previously (25Yeh W.-C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), T2KO MEFs were only slightly susceptible to TNF-induced cell death in the absence of CHX (Fig.4A) but was highly susceptible in the presence of CHX (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the susceptibility of T5KO MEFs was almost comparable with that of wild-type MEFs in the absence or presence of CHX. Notably, DKO MEFs were highly susceptible to TNF-induced cell death even in the absence of CHX (Fig. 4A) and were more susceptible than T2KO MEFs in the presence of CHX (Fig. 4B). These results suggested a redundant but critical role of TRAF2 and TRAF5 in protecting MEFs from TNF-induced cell death, which is dependent on protein synthesis, and a predominant role of TRAF2 in the absence of protein synthesis. In the present study, we investigated the relative contributions of TRAF2 and TRAF5 to TNF-induced NF-κB activation, JNK activation, and protection from TNF-induced cell death by utilizing MEFs from T2KO, T5KO, and DKO mice. We found redundant or nonredundant roles for TRAF2 and TRAF5 in these TNF responses. We and others previously showed that TRAF5, as well as TRAF2, is used by multiple members of the TNF receptor superfamily (16Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Thus, we first speculated that TRAF5 is also involved in the TNF-R-mediated signaling pathway and can substitute for TRAF2 in NF-κB activation by TNF. We demonstrated that NF-κB activation by TNF, but not IL-1, was substantially reduced in DKO MEFs (Fig. 1). Moreover, we also showed that TRAF5 physically interacts with RIP (Fig. 3), an essential component of TNF-induced NF-κB activation (22Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 32Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In contrast to RIP-deficient cells (22Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 32Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), significant levels of TNF-induced NF-κB binding activity (Fig. 1A) and IKK activity (Fig.1B) were observed in DKO MEFs, especially at a later time point. This suggests that some molecule other than TRAF2 and TRAF5 may interact with RIP and mediate NF-κB activation. One possible candidate is p62, which interacts with RIP and activates atypical protein kinase C, resulting in IKK activation (33Sanz L. Sanchez P. Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3044-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that RIP interacts directly with IKKγ/NEMO and plays a critical role in the recruitment of the IKK complex to TNF-R1 (34Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 35Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism by which TRAFs activate NF-κB remains obscure. Initial studies have suggested that NIK or MEKK1 is involved in TNF-induced NF-κB activation (18Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 36Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). However, neither NIK- or MEKK1-deficient mice showed a substantial defect in TNF-induced NF-κB activation (37Yujiri T. Ware M. Widmann C. Oyer R. Russell D. Chan E. Zaitsu Y. Clarke P. Tyler K.

Science. 2001; 291: 2162-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), suggesting that these kinases are not essential or play redundant roles in TNF-induced NF-κB activation. Generation of NIK and MEKK1 double deficient mice will be required to address this issue. Alternatively, TRAF2 and TRAF5 may activate other signaling pathways independent of these kinases. A recent paper demonstrated that TRAF6 has ubiquitin ligase activity, which is required for TRAF6-mediated activation of IKK (40Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated a severe defect in TNF-induced JNK activation in T2KO MEFs (25Yeh W.-C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). In contrast to TNF-induced NF-κB activation in DKO MEFs, there was no additional defect in TNF-induced JNK activation in DKO MEFs as compared with T2KO MEFs (Fig. 2). Although overexpression of TRAF5 could activate JNK, the ability of TRAF5 to activate JNK and the dominant negative effect of truncated TRAF5 on JNK activation were relatively weaker than those of TRAF2 (31Akiba H. Nakano H. Nishinaka S. Shindo M. Kobata T. Morimoto C. Ware C.F. Malinin N.L. Wallach D. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13353-13358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Altogether, TRAF5 seems to play a greater role in TNF-induced NF-κB activation than in JNK activation under physiological conditions. Our present examination of the susceptibility of T2KO, T5KO, and DKO MEFs to TNF-induced cell death has revealed both redundant and nonredundant roles of TRAF2 and TRAF5 in protection from TNF-induced cell death. In the absence of CHX, DKO but not T2KO or T5KO MEFs were highly susceptible to TNF-induced cell death (Fig. 4A). In the presence of CHX, both T2KO and DKO but not T5KO MEFs were highly susceptible to TNF-induced cell death (Fig. 4B). Collectively, these data suggested that TRAF2 and TRAF5 may redundantly mediate NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic pathway, which is dependent on protein synthesis. TRAF2 may also mediate an NF-κB-independent anti-apoptotic pathway, which is not dependent on protein synthesis. Previous studies reported that expression of XIAP, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and A1/Bfl-1 was induced by TNF in an NF-κB-dependent manner in various types of cells (41Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentry J.J.

Although our RNase protection assay and Northern blot analysis showed that induction of A1/Bfl-1 was severely impaired in DKO MEFs, stable transfection of A1/Bfl-1 did not fully protect DKO MEFs from TNF-induced cell death (data not shown). These results suggest that some molecule(s) other than A1/Bfl-1 induced by NF-κB may be primary responsible for TRAF-mediated NF-κB-dependent protection from TNF-induced cell death. Further studies are now under way to identify such molecules.

This coordination is achieved by signal transduction systems that integrate signals from the status of the carbon and nitrogen metabolism and regulate the level of glutamine synthetase (GS)1activity and the transcription of genes involved in the utilization of different nitrogen sources (reviewed in Refs. 1Merrick M.J. Edwards R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 604-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Atkinson M.R. Peliska J.A. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 31-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). GS catalyzes the ATP-dependent amidation of glutamate to yield glutamine. GS operates sequentially with the enzyme glutamate synthase (GOGAT), which catalyzes the transfer of the amide group from glutamine to 2-oxoglutarate to yield two molecules of glutamate. This pathway (commonly known as the GS-GOGAT cycle) represents the connecting step between carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Ammonium is the preferred nitrogen source for most of the microorganisms. In the presence of abundant carbon sources, ammonium deficiency results in a high level of GS activity, presumably to warrant the assimilation of the small amount of free ammonium available. At the same time, genes that encode enzymes or transport proteins involved in the utilization of alternative nitrogen sources are activated. On the contrary, in the presence of ammonium, GS activity is down-regulated, and genes involved in utilization of alternative sources of nitrogen are repressed (1Merrick M.J. Edwards R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 604-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Atkinson M.R. Peliska J.A. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 31-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although the general rules outlined above are shared by most of the prokaryotes, the regulatory networks controlling nitrogen metabolism differ between the different bacterial groups. In enteric bacteria, the global Ntr system is responsible for the control of GS activity at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (reviewed in Refs. 1Merrick M.J. Edwards R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 604-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Atkinson M.R. Peliska J.A. Curr. Top. Cell.

The two-component regulatory system composed of the histidine kinase NtrB and the response regulator NtrC controls the transcription of the glnA gene. Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of NtrC by NtrB is controlled by the signal-transducing protein PII and a uridylyltransferase (Utase/UR) that modifies the PII protein, by uridylylation, in response to the nitrogen status of the cell. Uridylyltransferase and PII proteins also control the activity of the adenylyltransferase. This enzyme carries out the covalent modification of GS by adenylylation. The adenylylated GS form is highly sensitive to feedback inhibition by a number of metabolites that contain a nitrogen atom derived from glutamine and that accumulate under nitrogen-rich conditions. Therefore, adenylylation determines that GS activity decreases dramatically. In addition to GS levels, expression of genes involved in transport and metabolism of alternative nitrogen sources is also dependent on the Ntr system. Gram-positive bacteria lack a typical Ntr system, and there is no evidence for a post-transcriptional control of GS activity (6Deuel T.F. Prusiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 257-264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fisher S.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). InBacillus subtilis, transcription of the bicistronic operonglnRA is repressed by the GlnR transcription factor under conditions of nitrogen excess (reviewed in Ref. 7Fisher S.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Among other genes, GlnR also represses the expression of the transcription factor TnrA. Under conditions of nitrogen limitation, repression of glnRAand tnrA expression by GlnR is released; GS activity increases; and TnrA induces the expression of a number of genes involved in utilization of alternative nitrogen sources. Both GlnR and TnrA belong to the MerR family of DNA-binding regulatory proteins. None of them has been shown to be modified in response to nitrogen limitation or excess. In cyanobacteria, transcription of nitrogen-regulated genes is under the control of the DNA-binding protein NtcA (recently reviewed in Ref.8Herrero A. Muro-Pastor A.M. Flores E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). NtcA belongs to the CRP (catabolic repressor protein) family of bacterial transcription factors. Transcription of theglnA gene is activated by NtcA in the presence of poor nitrogen sources (nitrate or dinitrogen) and under conditions of nitrogen starvation. In addition to control glnA expression, NtcA also activates transcription at a set of promoters induced in the absence of ammonium and involved in the utilization of alternative nitrogen sources. Like GlnR or TnrA, NtcA modification in response to the nitrogen status has not been shown; and therefore, how NtcA activity is controlled is unknown. In the cyanobacteriumSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803, GS is inactivated upon ammonium upshift. In this case, GS activity is modulated by protein-protein interaction with two polypeptides (IF7 and IF17). Direct binding of IF7 or IF17 to GS results in the formation of an inactive GS·IF complex (9Garcı́a-Domı́nguez M. Reyes J.C. Florencio F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7161-7166Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). IF7 and IF17 are homologous proteins encoded by two unlinked genes, gifA and gifB. Synechocystis ΔgifA and ΔgifB mutant strains are severely impaired in GS inactivation, and the double mutantΔgifAΔgifB is completely deficient in GS inactivation. Formation of the GS·IF complex seems to be determined only by the intracellular concentration of IFs. Expression of IF7 and IF17 is repressed by the transcription factor NtcA under conditions of nitrogen deficiency (10Garcı́a-Domı́nguez M. Reyes J.C. Florencio F.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1192-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, derepression of the gifA andgifB genes in the presence of ammonium determines the synthesis of IF7 and IF17 and the inactivation of GS. Although the molecular mechanisms that control GS activity and synthesis are relatively well known in several bacterial model systems, such as those that have been discussed above, much less is understood about how the nitrogen status of the cell is sensed and the molecules that are involved in signaling. Many different studies with purified signal transduction components of the adenylylation cascade suggest that 2-oxoglutarate and glutamine are the signaling molecules inEscherichia coli. However, in vivo data are scarce. Early studies by Senior (11Senior P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 407-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in E. coli also indicated that intracellular levels of 2-oxoglutarate and glutamine correlate with the degree of adenylylation of GS. An exhaustive study by Kustu and co-workers (12Ikeda T.P. Shauger A.E. Kustu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) suggests that nitrogen limitation is perceived by Salmonella typhimurium as a decrease in the intracellular concentration of the glutamine pool. This was deduced from the direct correlation between nitrogen-limited growth rate and the intracellular concentration of glutamine. This correlation is far less obvious in B. subtilis, suggesting that other metabolites are probably involved in nitrogen sensing (13Hu P. Leighton T. Ishkhanova G. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5042-5050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the two previously cited works did not report data on the intracellular 2-oxoglutarate pool. In cyanobacteria, it was demonstrated long ago that the ammonium-promoted repression of nitrate or dinitrogen utilization does not occur in the presence of inhibitors of the GS-GOGAT pathway (14Herrero A. Flores E. Guerrero M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 175-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Stewart W.D. Rowell P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 65: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), also suggesting that metabolites related to the GS-GOGAT cycle are involved in signaling. In this work, we used two different Synechocystis mutants with altered levels of GS to study the metabolic signals involved in controlling NtcA-dependent genes. Our data strongly indicate thatSynechocystis senses nitrogen status by detecting changes in the intracellular pool of 2-oxoglutarate irrespective of the intracellular glutamine and glutamate concentrations. Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 was grown photoautotrophically at 30 °C in BG11 medium (16Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) supplemented with 1 g/liter NaHCO3 (BG11C) and bubbled with a continuous stream of 1% (v/v) CO2 in air under continuous fluorescent illumination (50 μmol of photons·m−2 s−1, white light). To achieve nitrogen starvation, cells were harvested at room temperature by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min, washed, and resuspended in fresh medium lacking the nitrogen source (BG110C). For plate cultures, BG11C liquid medium was solidified by 1% (w/v) agar. When ammonium was used as nitrogen source, nitrate was replaced by 10 mm NH4Cl, and the medium was buffered with 20 mm TES (pH 7.0). Total RNA was isolated from 25-ml samples of Synechocystis cultures at the mid-exponential phase (3–5 μg/ml chlorophyll). Extractions were performed by vortexing cells in the presence of phenol/chloroform and acid-washed baked glass beads (0.25–0.3-mm diameter; Braun, Melsungen, Germany) as previously described (17Garcı́a-Domı́nguez M. Florencio F.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For Northern blotting, 15 μg of total RNA was loaded per lane and electrophoresed on denaturing formaldehyde-containing 1.2% agarose gels. Transfer to nylon membranes (Hybond N-plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), prehybridization, hybridization, and washes were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Probes for the genes gifA,gifB, icd, glnA, glnN, andglnB were obtained as previously described (9Garcı́a-Domı́nguez M. Reyes J.C. Florencio F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

AnirA gene probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides nit1 (5′-CGTATTCCCCACGGCTTGCTCACC-3′) and nit2 (5′-GACACCACTGACCGTTGCAGATTG-3′). An nblA gene probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides nbl1 (5′-GAAAGGTAGTCGCCTTGGAGGGC-3′) and nbl2 (5′-CCTGTTGCAAACACTGCAGTTG-3′). As a control, in all cases, the filters were reprobed with a 580-base pair HindIII-BamHI probe from plasmid pAV1100 containing the constitutively expressed RNase P RNA gene from Synechocystis (20Vioque A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6331-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To determine the cpm of radioactive areas in Northern blot hybridizations, an InstantImager electronic autoradiography apparatus (Packard Instrument Co.) was used. GS activity was determined in situusing the Mn2+-dependent γ-glutamyltransferase assay in cells permeabilized with mixed alkyltrimethylammonium bromide (21Mérida A. Candau P. Florencio F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4095-4100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of GS activity corresponds to the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of 1 μmol of γ-glutamyl hydroxamate/min. Cells from 2 ml of culture were recovered by centrifugation, and cell lysates were obtained by adding 0.45 ml of 0.2 n HCl, followed by vigorous shaking and incubation for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation, supernatant was filtered through an Ultrafree-MC 10,000 NMWL filter unit (Millipore Corp.) for deproteinization. The amino acid concentration of the deproteinized lysate was determined by HPLC using a 3.9 × 150-mm Nova-Pak C18 column. Amino acids were separated using a linear gradient from 50 mm phosphate-acetate buffer (pH 7.5)/tetrahydrofuran/methanol (96:2:2) to methanol/water (65:35). The following 19 amino acids were determined (retention times given in parentheses): Asp (2.23 min), Glu (3.69 min), Asn (7.91 min), Ser (9.48 min), Gln (10.93 min), Gly (13.18 min), Arg (14.24 min), Thr (14.86 min), Ala (18.66 min), GABA (20.07 min), Tyr (22.00 min), Met (30.75 min), Val (31.91 min), Trp (33.00 min), Phe (36.48 min), Ile (39.75 min), Leu (41.28 min), Orn (46.83 min), and Lys (48.18 min). For the determination of the intracellular 2-oxoglutarate concentration, cells from 150–200-ml cultures (∼1 mg of chlorophyll) were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 8 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 1.5 ml (final volume) of cold 0.3 mHClO4 and incubated for 15 min on ice. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the 2-oxoglutarate in the supernatant was analyzed spectrophotometrically using glutamate dehydrogenase as described previously (11Senior P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 407-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glass beads crude extracts fromSynechocystis grown under different conditions were made as previously described (22Reyes J.C. Florencio F.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Samples of cell-free extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose sheet, and Western blotting was carried out as described (24Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). Purified polyclonal antibodies obtained against Synechococcus sp. PCC 6301 glutamine synthetase were used (25Marqués S. Mérida A. Candau P. Florencio F.J. Planta. 1992; 187: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two different GS-encoding genes have been found in a number of unicellular non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria: glnA and glnN(26Crespo J.L. Garcı́a-Domı́nguez M. Florencio F.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Reyes J.C. Florencio F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1260-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The glnA gene encodes the typical prokaryotic dodecameric GS (known as GS type I (GSI)). In the presence of a nitrogen source, Synechocystis GSI accounts for >95% of the total GS activity. The glnN gene encodes a hexameric GS (known as GS type III). GS type III is synthesized preferentially under nitrogen deprivation, and its activity is fully inhibited in the presence of ammonium (27Reyes J.C. Florencio F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1260-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 28Reyes J.C. Florencio F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7516-7523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in ammonium-containing medium, Synechocystis ΔglnA cells completely lack GS activity. As expected, ΔglnA cells are unable to grow in ammonium-containing medium. As previously discussed, the transcription factor NtcA is required for regulation (activation or repression) of an extensive number of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism. To investigate the role of GSI in ammonium sensing, we analyzed the expression of three NtcA-dependent genes upon ammonium addition to nitrate-grown WT and ΔglnAmutant cells. We selected genes that strongly change its level of expression upon ammonium upshift, such as the gifA,gifB, and nirA genes. The gifA andgifB genes encode IF7 and IF17, respectively, the inactivating factors of Synechocystis GSI. Both genes are subject to repression by NtcA in the absence of ammonium (10Garcı́a-Domı́nguez M. Reyes J.C. Florencio F.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1192-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, ammonium upshift provoked strong derepression of both promoters in WT cells (Fig. 1). Interestingly, ammonium-promoted derepression of both genes was severely impaired in the ΔglnA cells. We also analyzed the expression of the nirA gene (structural gene for nitrite reductase). Transcription of the nirA gene is activated by NtcA in the absence of ammonium. 2M. I. Muro-Pastor, unpublished data. Ammonium upshift provoked a decrease in the level of nirA transcript in the case of the WT cells, but not in the case of ΔglnA mutant cells. These results suggest that GSI activity is required for the transduction of the ammonium-promoted signal to the NtcA protein. Thereafter, we examined the behavior of NtcA-dependent genes in a strain with constitutive levels of GSI activity. We have previously shown that ΔgifAΔgifB cells are unable to inactivate GSI in response to ammonium upshift (9Garcı́a-Domı́nguez M. Reyes J.C. Florencio F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7161-7166Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, ΔgifA, ΔgifB, and ΔgifAΔgifB mutant cells showed little growth defect using either nitrate (a poor nitrogen source for Synechocystis) or ammonium as nitrogen source (data not shown). We have previously shown that the level of GSI activity in steady-state ammonium-grown WT cells is ∼5–10% of the level in nitrate-grown cells. In contrast, glnA mRNA and GSI protein levels found in ammonium-grown cells were ∼50% of the level found in nitrate-grown cells (Fig.2, B and C) (19Reyes J.C. Muro-Pastor M.I. Florencio F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2678-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,21Mérida A. Candau P. Florencio F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4095-4100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Mérida A. Leurentop L. Candau P. Florencio F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4732-4735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that most of the GSI is inactive in WT cells grown in ammonium-containing medium. Since ΔgifAΔgifB cells lack the GSI inactivation system, a high GSI activity level was expected under these conditions. However, ΔgifAΔgifB cells displayed only ∼2-fold more GSI activity than WT cells (Fig. 2A). To investigate how ΔgifAΔgifB cells are able to down-regulate GSI activity levels in the presence of ammonium, Northern and Western blot experiments were carried out to determine the amount of the glnA transcript and GSI protein, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 (B and C), the levels of both theglnA transcript and GSI protein were strongly down-regulated in ΔgifAΔgifB cells. A clear but less severe reduction in the level of the glnA transcript was also observed in ΔgifA and ΔgifB cells. The addition of ammonium to nitrate-grown cultures provoked a significant decrease in the growth rate of ΔgifAΔgifB cells, but not in WT cells (Fig.3A). Fig. 3B shows the kinetics of the glnA transcript level upon ammonium upshift. In WT cells, the glnA transcript dropped dramatically to almost undetectable levels and then quickly recovered to ∼40% of the original level. However, in ΔgifAΔgifB cells, the level of theglnA transcript remained undetectable 24 h after the ammonium shift. To verify whether the ammonium-promoted hyperrepression found for the glnA gene in ΔgifAΔgifB cells occurred also for other NtcA-dependent genes, we analyzed the ammonium-promoted repression of the nirA and icd (encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase) genes. Interestingly, expression of thenirA gene was also hyperrepressed by ammonium in the ΔgifAΔgifB strain. In contrast, the levels of the icd transcript did not change significantly upon ammonium upshift in either WT or ΔgifAΔgifBcells (Fig. 3, B and C). In fact, it has previously been shown that NtcA induces transcription of theicd gene only under conditions of nitrogen deprivation (18Muro-Pastor M.I. Reyes J.C. Florencio F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4070-4076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see below). To investigate whether alterations in the expression patterns of NtcA-dependent genes can be correlated with changes in the intracellular concentration of metabolites, we determined the intracellular pools of several amino acids and of 2-oxoglutarate. We have previously shown that the addition of ammonium to nitrate-grown Synechocystis cells provokes a quick and dramatic change in the intracellular pools of glutamate and glutamine (21Mérida A. Candau P. Florencio F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4095-4100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A few seconds after the addition of ammonium, the glutamine concentration increases ∼30–40-fold with a concomitant decrease in the glutamate pool. About 5–10 min later, the glutamate and glutamine pools start to revert to the steady-state level, and normal levels are completely restored ∼30 min after ammonium shift. It is worth noting that changes in the glutamate and glutamine pools are dramatically attenuated in ΔglnA mutant cells, indicating that GSI is responsible for the changes in concentration observed in the WT strain (28Reyes J.C. Florencio F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7516-7523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously proposed that restoration of the glutamate and glutamine concentrations to the steady-state levels is the consequence of the GSI inactivation mechanism (21Mérida A. Candau P. Florencio F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4095-4100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If this is true, the amount of glutamine in ΔgifAΔgifB cells should increase endlessly upon the ammonium upshift. We have monitored the intracellular concentration of 19 amino acids (see “Experimental Procedures”) and the keto acid 2-oxoglutarate after ammonium addition to nitrate-grown cells. 1 min after ammonium shift, the level of glutamine increased ∼30-fold in both WT and ΔgifAΔgifB cells. At the same time, the glutamate and GABA pool sizes decreased ∼3- and 6-fold, respectively (Fig. 4A). In the WT cells, the pools of glutamate, glutamine, and GABA were restored gradually during the following hour. However, in ΔgifAΔgifB cells, the pools of these three amino acids remained altered at least during the following 24 h. The glutamine pool decreased partially over a few minutes after reaching the top level and then increased continuously during the 4-h post-ammonium shift. The intracellular glutamine pool reached concentrations as high as 197.9 nmol/mg of protein (∼40 mm), but glutamine was not significantly excreted into the medium. 16 h post-ammonium shift, the glutamine pool initiated a very slow decrease, but 24 h later, the concentration was still ∼50 nmol/mg of protein (∼17-fold higher concentration than in WT cells under the same conditions) (data not shown). The glutamate and GABA pools in ΔgifAΔgifB cells remained at low levels (12.3 ± 2.2 and 13.0 ± 1.6 nmol/mg of protein, respectively) at least during the first 24 h post-ammonium shift (Fig. 4 and data not shown). These data demonstrate that at least one of the physiological functions of the GSI inactivation system in cyanobacteria is to restore amino acid homeostasis upon strong changes in the availability of nitrogen. Thereafter, we determined the change in the intracellular pool of 2-oxoglutarate in the WT, ΔgifAΔgifB, and ΔglnA strains upon the addition of ammonium to nitrate-grown cells. In WT cells, the intracellular concentration of 2-oxoglutarate decreased dramatically 15 min upon ammonium upshift. However, 1 h after the shift, the 2-oxoglutarate concentration recovered to ∼40% of the original level. In the ΔgifAΔgifB cells, the level of 2-oxoglutarate was low (0.22 ± 0.05 nmol/mg of protein) even in nitrate-grown cells. As in the WT strain, the addition of ammonium provoked a decrease in the intracellular pool of 2-oxoglutarate. However and in contrast to the WT strain, the steady-state levels of the keto acid were not recovered 1 h later in this strain. Finally, in the ΔglnA strain, the 2-oxoglutarate pool remained high at least 1 h after ammonium upshift. To investigate the role of the glutamine pool in nitrogen signaling, we analyzed the induction of NtcA-dependent genes in the presence of a high intracellular pool of glutamine. For this, we took advantage of the elevated glutamine concentration of the ΔgifAΔgifB cells upon ammonium upshift. Nitrate-grown WT and ΔgifAΔgifB cells were subjected to ammonium upshift over 4 h and subsequently transferred to nitrogen-free medium. The kinetics of induction of five NtcA-activated genes were analyzed by Northern blotting. In this case, we selected genes that are strongly induced under nitrogen deficiency, such as glnA, glnN (encoding GS type III) (19Reyes J.C. Muro-Pastor M.I. Florencio F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2678-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar),glnB (encoding the signaling protein PII) (17Garcı́a-Domı́nguez M. Florencio F.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar),icd (18Muro-Pastor M.I. Reyes J.C. Florencio F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4070-4076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and nblA (encoding a small polypeptide required for phycobiliprotein degradation during nitrogen starvation) (30Collier J.L. Grossman A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 31Richaud C. Zabulon G. Joder A. Thomas J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2989-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).2 For all the tested genes, accumulation of mRNA was significantly or severely delayed in the ΔgifAΔgifB cells compared with the WT cells (Fig. 5). Furthermore, none of the analyzed transcripts reached the WT levels even 4 h after induction. We also studied the intracellular pools of metabolites under these conditions (Fig. 6). After the first 15 min of nitrogen deprivation, only the glutamine pool changed significantly in the WT strain, decreasing from 3.17 to 0.76 nmol/mg of protein. In the ΔgifAΔgifB cells, nitrogen starvation provoked a fast mobilization of the large glutamine pool. Thus, the glutamine concentration decreased from 92.85 ± 7.01 to 2.76 ± 0.78 nmol/mg of protein in only 15 min. The concomitant increase in the glutamate, GABA, and arginine pools suggests that glutamine was quickly transformed into glutamate by the GOGAT enzyme and that the glutamate was then metaboliz"

Since oxidants have been implicated in the regulation of NF-κB, the focus of the present study was the activation of IKK by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in the presence or absence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Exposure of mouse alveolar epithelial cells to H2O2 was not sufficient to activate IKK, degrade IκBα, or activate NF-κB. In contrast, TNFα induced IKK activity rapidly and transiently resulting in IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation. Importantly, in the presence of H2O2, the ability of TNFα to induce IKK activity was markedly decreased and resulted in prevention of IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation. Neither tyrosine kinases nor phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, known regulators of NF-κB by oxidants, were involved in IKK inhibition by H2O2. Direct addition of H2O2 to the immunoprecipitated IKK complex inhibited enzyme activity. Inhibition of IKK activity by H2O2 was associated with direct oxidation of cysteine residues present in the IKK complex and occurred only in enzymatically active IKK.

For instance, diseases of the lung such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are accompanied by the presence of oxidants (1van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. Shigenaga M.K. Cross C.E. Am.

Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are capable of causing oxidative damage to macromolecules including lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and protein modifications such as oxidation of cysteine residues (4Marshall H.E. Merchant K. Stamler J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14 (900): 1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 5Wu W. Samoszuk M.K. Comhair S.A. Thomassen M.J. Farver C.F. Dweik R.A. Kavuru M.S. Erzurum S.C. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). After exposure, the cellular response to oxidants depends on the induction of signaling cascades and activation of transcription factors like nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)1 and activating protein-1.The transcription factor NF-κB is known to be responsive to oxidative stress (6Flohe L.

Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1317-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). NF-κB plays a pivotal role in the development of chronic inflammation, cell survival, and proliferation (8Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4571) Google Scholar, 9Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 729-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 10Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3414) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm through interaction with IκB inhibitory proteins. Exposure to a number of stimuli (e.g. cytokines, lipopolysaccharide, and viruses) will result in the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IκB, liberating the NF-κB dimers (7Janssen-Heininger Y.M. Poynter M.E. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1317-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 8Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev.

The NF-κB complex translocates into the nucleus and transcriptionally activates target genes by binding to responsive elements in the DNA called κB motifs. Phosphorylation of the inhibitory protein IκB occurs at specific serine residues (11DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16 (304): 1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by IκB kinases (IKKs) (12Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).IKK is present as a large (700–900 kDa) complex composed of two catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ (13Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The IKK complex serves as a point of convergence for both positive and negative NF-κB regulators (14Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Upstream kinases including mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), NF-κB-inducing kinase, and protein kinase B (Akt) activate the IKK complex through mechanisms not fully understood but result in the phosphorylation of two serine residues in the activation loop of IKKα (serines 176 and 180) and IKKβ (serines 177 and 181) (13Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 14Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M.

This activation occurs rapidly and is followed by a series of autophosphorylation events of serine residues present in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the IKKβ subunit. When a critical number of serine residues are phosphorylated, the complex becomes inactive (13Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) as was demonstrated by replacement of 9–10 C-terminal serines residues by alanines, which resulted in a complex that was active four times longer (14Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Since the IKK complex is an important mediator in the positive and negative regulation of NF-κB, it requires stringent regulation achieved through rapid activation and inactivation.An alternative activation pathway of NF-κB exists, specifically important for activation by oxidants, including pervanadate, hypoxia/reoxygenation, and UV-C (16Li N. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13012-13017Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), in which the NF-κB complex was liberated upon tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα (16Li N.

This alternative pathway involves phosphorylation of tyrosine 42 instead of serines 32 and 36 (17, 21), is in some systems (17Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B.

A. 1999; 96: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) associated with degradation of IκBα, and does not appear to involve the activation of IKK (22Schoonbroodt S. Ferreira V. Best-Belpomme M. Boelaert J.R. Legrand-Poels S. Korner M. Piette J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4292-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The interaction between the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα may serve to dissociate NF-κB from IκBα without degradation (21Beraud C. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Importantly oxidants, including H2O2, are known to activate the PI3K pathway (23Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 24Sonoda Y. Watanabe S. Matsumoto Y. Aizu-Yokota E. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10566-10570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which oxidants activate NF-κB remains to be elucidated, but it is becoming clear from the available data that oxidant-induced NF-κB activation is highly cell type-dependent (25Bonizzi G. Piette J. Schoonbroodt S. Greimers R. Havard L. Merville M.P. Bours V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1950-1960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pointing perhaps to a lack of a uniform mechanism of activation (26Li N. Karin M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1137-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar).During pulmonary inflammatory disease states, epithelial cells are simultaneously exposed to both oxidants and inflammatory cytokines. However, most studies to date have not considered simultaneous exposure of cells to oxidants and cytokines. Furthermore, no studies have investigated the effects of oxidants on IKK activation in lung epithelial cells, an important target for inhaled or inflammatory cell-derived oxidants. Therefore, we investigated the effects of TNFα and H2O2 on IKK activation in lung epithelial cells. Our data demonstrates that H2O2 by itself does not activate NF-κB in a line of alveolar type II cells. However, H2O2 decreased the ability of TNFα to induce IKK activation, IκBα degradation, and NF-κB activation by direct oxidation of cysteine residues in the activated IKK complex. In contrast to other observations, our studies demonstrate a negative role for H2O2 in the activation of NF-κB by TNFα due to oxidative inactivation of the IKK complex.DISCUSSIONThe transcription factor NF-κB is an important regulator of immune responses. It is induced by a wide variety of stresses and transcriptionally activates many cytokine and chemokine genes, genes important in proliferation, matrix degradation, and prevention of apoptosis. Oxidative stress has been thought to play a critical role in its activation based upon many observations that demonstrate that cytokine-induced NF-κB can be prevented following treatment with antioxidants or metal chelators. The role of oxidants per se in the activation of NF-κB has been the subject of considerable debate (7Janssen-Heininger Y.M. Poynter M.E. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1317-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 26Li N. Karin M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1137-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). It appears that the ability of H2O2 to induce NF-κB depends on the cell type being investigated and may be linked to the levels of antioxidants present in those cells (7Janssen-Heininger Y.M. Poynter M.E. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1317-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 25Bonizzi G. Piette J. Schoonbroodt S. Greimers R. Havard L. Merville M.P. Bours V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1950-1960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Li N. Karin M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1137-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). However, even within one cell type marked variations in the ability of H2O2 to activate NF-κB are apparent. For instance, among investigated T cell lines, Wurzburg T cells but not Jurkat T lymphocytes are responsive to H2O2 (for a review, see Ref. 26Li N. Karin M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1137-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). In support of this variability, our laboratory demonstrated in a line of RLE cells that H2O2 caused activation of an NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter gene (20Janssen-Heininger Y.M. Macara I. Mossman B.T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 942-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) in contrast to our present observations obtained in the mouse counterpart, C10 cells. The differences in the response to H2O2 between C10 and RLE cells could be due to differences in culture conditions, antioxidant defenses, or time frames that were analyzed. The increases in NF-κB- dependent luciferase activity in RLE cells treated with H2O2 occurred without the preceding activation of IKK (Fig. 2 D) or the degradation of IκBα (20Janssen-Heininger Y.M. Macara I. Mossman B.T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 942-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with findings by other groups demonstrating that the PI3K/Akt pathway, induced by oxidants (23Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 24Sonoda Y. Watanabe S. Matsumoto Y. Aizu-Yokota E. Kasahara T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18881-18887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast to the aforementioned studies, phosphorylation of tyrosine 42 of IκBα induced by H2O2 or pervanadate can in fact result in degradation of IκBα (22Schoonbroodt S. Ferreira V.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8549-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), illustrating the conflicting nature of the studies published to date. In addition to the regulation of IKK and IκBα by oxidants, oxidants also affect NF-κB-dependent transcription. Phosphorylation of RelA by Akt results in transactivation of NF-κB (38Madrid L.V.

Biol. 1999; 19 (805): 4798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thus in NF-κB-regulated gene transcription. Variations in the activation of Akt or other kinases involved in the PI3K/Akt pathway might exist between C10 and RLE cells explaining the discrepancies observed in NF-κB-regulated luciferase activity between rat and mouse. Another explanation for this phenomenon may be the effects oxidants have on the activity of histone deacetylases. For instance, Ito et al.(40Ito K. Lim S. Caramori G. Chung K.F. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1110-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that oxidants are capable of inactivating histone deacetylase-2, thereby promoting gene transcription. Not all histone deacetylases might be equally sensitive to oxidants, and different histone deacetylases might be expressed in different cell lines cells.The IKK complex is an important point of convergence used by many different stimuli to activate NF-κB. Upstream kinases in the NF-κB pathway that include MEKK1 and NF-κB-inducing kinase phosphorylate IKKα on serines 176 and 180 and IKKβ on serines 177 and 181 in their kinase domain. Mutation of these serine residues to alanines leads to inactivation of the IKK complex and inhibits the activation of NF-κB. Importantly IKK is also an important target for negative regulation of NF-κB (41Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G.

Of the two catalytic subunits of the IKK complex, IKKβ has the major role in responding to pro-inflammatory stimuli (5Wu W. Samoszuk M.K. Comhair S.A. Thomassen M.J. Farver C.F. Dweik R.A.

Samoszuk M.K. Comhair S.A. Thomassen M.J. Farver C.F. Dweik R.A. Kavuru M.S. Erzurum S.C. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 26Li N. Karin M.

Since no information exists about the direct effects of H2O2 on the regulation of IKK, we investigated in the present study whether this oxidant could directly affect the enzymatic activity. In support of previous observations demonstrating a lack of degradation of IκBα in response to oxidative stress, our present data also reveal a lack of activation of IKK in cells treated with bolus H2O2 or H2O2 generated continuously by GOx.Despite the lack of effect of H2O2 itself on IKK activity, H2O2 affected signal-induced IKK activation by causing a marked decrease in enzyme activity. This effect was independent of Akt or tyrosine kinase activity and was also observed when H2O2 was added to immunoprecipitated, active IKK. These results strongly suggest that H2O2 is capable of directly inactivating IKK due to the redox sensitivity of the complex. This redox sensitivity was further demonstrated in experiments using BIAM (29Kim J.R. Yoon H.W. Kwon K.S. Lee S.R. Rhee S.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 283: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), which detects oxidation of cysteine residues. Marked cysteine oxidation of the enzymatically active IKK complex occurred following treatment with H2O2. We detected a remarkable difference in cysteine oxidation between sham and TNFα-treated cells exposed to H2O2, indicating that only the active IKK complex is sensitive to H2O2-induced cysteine oxidation. This explains the lack of inhibition of H2O2 on baseline IKK activity as observed in this study.At present, we do not know the cysteine site(s) of the IKK complex that may be oxidatively modified by H2O2. One likely candidate is cysteine 179 in the kinase domain of IKKβ. Recent studies demonstrated that that the cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15-deoxy-Δ12–14-prostaglandin J2 covalently modified cysteine 179 of IKKβ decreasing its enzymatic activity and consequently blocking NF-κB activation (41Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Similarly arsenite, which is reactive toward vicinal thiols, binds cysteine 179 of IKKβ, inhibiting enzymatic activity of the IKK complex (43Kapahi P. Takahashi T. Natoli G. Adams S.R. Chen Y. Tsien R.Y. Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36062-36066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Consequently a mutant of IKKβ, in which cysteine 179 is replaced with alanine, is refractory to inhibition by arsenite or 15-deoxy-Δ12–14-prostaglandin J2. Cysteine 179 is located between serines 177 and 181 in the kinase domain. Oxidative modification of this amino acid might alter the conformation of the complex and may prevent upstream kinases from phosphorylating the serines 177 and 181, thereby preventing activation of the complex. Therefore, cysteine 179 of IKKβ also appears to be a likely candidate for oxidation and enzymatic inactivation by H2O2.The decrease in TNFα-induced IKK activity observed in the presence of H2O2 translated into a diminished degradation of IκBα, decreased NF-κB binding to DNA, and a decrease in the NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation. These results suggest that under inflammatory conditions where H2O2 is formed NF-κB activation could become depressed. The ramifications of this oxidant effect are unclear. The decreased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators may be associated with a dampened inflammatory response in response to proinflammatory stimuli, which could be beneficial to disorders associated with chronic inflammation. Alternatively the decreased ability to activate NF-κB in the presence of H2O2 may be associated with an enhancement of apoptosis when inflammatory cytokines are present. We currently are investigating the ramifications to pulmonary epithelium following combined exposures to cytokines and oxidants. Oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases. For instance, diseases of the lung such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are accompanied by the presence of oxidants (1van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. Shigenaga M.K. Cross C.E. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 2Repine J.E. Bast A. Lankhorst I. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Immunol. 1999; 104: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are capable of causing oxidative damage to macromolecules including lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and protein modifications such as oxidation of cysteine residues (4Marshall H.E. Merchant K. Stamler J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14 (900): 1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 5Wu W. Samoszuk M.K. Comhair S.A. Thomassen M.J. Farver C.F. Dweik R.A. Kavuru M.S. Erzurum S.C. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). After exposure, the cellular response to oxidants depends on the induction of signaling cascades and activation of transcription factors like nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)1 and activating protein-1. The transcription factor NF-κB is known to be responsive to oxidative stress (6Flohe L. Brigelius-Flohe R. Saliou C. Traber M.G. Packer L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 7Janssen-Heininger Y.M. Poynter M.E. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1317-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). NF-κB plays a pivotal role in the development of chronic inflammation, cell survival, and proliferation (8Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4571) Google Scholar, 9Baeuerle P.A.

In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm through interaction with IκB inhibitory proteins. Exposure to a number of stimuli (e.g. cytokines, lipopolysaccharide, and viruses) will result in the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IκB, liberating the NF-κB dimers (7Janssen-Heininger Y.M. Poynter M.E. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1317-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 8Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev.

The NF-κB complex translocates into the nucleus and transcriptionally activates target genes by binding to responsive elements in the DNA called κB motifs. Phosphorylation of the inhibitory protein IκB occurs at specific serine residues (11DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16 (304): 1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by IκB kinases (IKKs) (12Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). IKK is present as a large (700–900 kDa) complex composed of two catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ (13Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The IKK complex serves as a point of convergence for both positive and negative NF-κB regulators (14Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Upstream kinases including mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), NF-κB-inducing kinase, and protein kinase B (Akt) activate the IKK complex through mechanisms not fully understood but result in the phosphorylation of two serine residues in the activation loop of IKKα (serines 176 and 180) and IKKβ (serines 177 and 181) (13Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 14Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 15Yamamoto Y. Yin M.J. Gaynor R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3655-3666Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This activation occurs rapidly and is followed by a series of autophosphorylation events of serine residues present in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the IKKβ subunit. When a critical number of serine residues are phosphorylated, the complex becomes inactive (13Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) as was demonstrated by replacement of 9–10 C-terminal serines residues by alanines, which resulted in a complex that was active four times longer (14Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Since the IKK complex is an important mediator in the positive and negative regulation of NF-κB, it requires stringent regulation achieved through rapid activation and inactivation. An alternative activation pathway of NF-κB exists, specifically important for activation by oxidants, including pervanadate, hypoxia/reoxygenation, and UV-C (16Li N. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13012-13017Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Googl"

Here we show that anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) delay PMN migration across collagen-coated filters or T84 epithelial monolayers toward the chemoattractant formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLP). Despite delayed transmigration by anti-CD47 mAbs, the numbers of PMN migrating across in either condition were the same as in the presence of control non-inhibitory mAbs. Cell surface labeling and immunoprecipitation demonstrated upregulation of CD47 to the PMN cell surface with kinetics similar to those of the transmigration response. Subcellular fractionation studies revealed redistribution of CD47 from intracellular compartments that co-sediment with secondary granules to plasma membrane-containing fractions after fMLP stimulation. Experiments performed to investigate potential signaling pathways revealed that inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation with genistein reversed the anti-CD47-mediated PMN migration delay, whereas inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase only partially reversed anti-CD47 effects that correlated with a rapid increase in PMN cell surface CD47. Analysis of the contribution of epithelial-expressed CD47 to PMN transmigration revealed that PMN migration across CD47-deficient epithelial monolayers (CaCO2) was significantly increased after stable transfection with CD47. These results suggest that cell surface CD47 and downstream tyrosine phosphorylation signaling events regulate, in part, the rate of PMN migration during the inflammatory response.

Under these conditions, PMN release active oxygen species, proteolytic enzymes, and inflammatory mediators that result in tissue injury. Thus, it is intuitive that large scale PMN migration and accumulation in tissues correlates with disease activity and patient symptoms (1Stockley R.A. Am. J.

The process of PMN movement from the vasculature, through the interstitial matrix, and across mucosal surfaces requires sequential interactions between neutrophil surface molecules and counter-receptors present on tissues or cell surfaces (3Parkos C.A.

Previous studies have shown that the leukocyte β2 integrin CD11bCD18 is essential in this process, especially in early interactions with epithelial and endothelial cells during the transmigration response (3Parkos C.A.

Although PMN migration across endothelial monolayers is only partially blocked by anti-CD11bCD18 antibodies, there is near complete inhibition of PMN migration across epithelial monolayers by the same antibodies (9Parkos C.A. Delp C. Arnaout M.A. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The importance of β2 integrins in PMN transmigration is manifested clinically by patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency who lack β2 integrins, resulting in a failure of PMN to migrate out of the vasculature and leaving high levels of circulating PMN (10Anderson D.C. Schmalstieg F.C. Arnaout M.A. Kohl S. Tosi M.F. Dana N. Buffone G.J. Hughes B.J. Brinkley B.R. Dickey W.D. et al.J. Clin.

CD47 was originally defined as a tumor-specific marker for ovarian carcinoma but is now known to be widely expressed on all hematopoietic cells and most other cell types (14Mawby W.J. Holmes C.H. Anstee D.J. Spring F.A. Tanner M.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3419-3425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary structure of human and mouse CD47 predicts the protein containing an N-terminal extracellular IgV domain, a membrane-spanning domain with multiple transmembrane α helices, and an intracellular loop (15Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating PMN transmigration, other studies have implicated CD47 in multiple cellular functions. In particular, antibodies to CD47 have been shown to interfere with αvβ3-mediated cell functions (15Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), as well as to block endothelial Ca2+ influxes during adhesion to fibronectin- or vitronectin-coated surfaces (17Schwartz M.A. Brown E.J.

Despite the diverse array of functional studies on CD47, the biochemical/molecular mechanism(s) of CD47 function remain undefined. Although we have previously observed anti-CD47 antibody-mediated inhibition of PMN transmigration (12Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Liang T.W. Nusrat A. Bacarra A.E. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the mechanism of CD47 function in PMN migration across epithelial cell monolayers and collagen-coated filters. Using a time-course transmigration assay, we demonstrate that fMLP-driven PMN migration across epithelial monolayers and collagen-coated filters is significantly delayed after cell surface CD47 is blocked by functionally inhibitory anti-CD47 mAbs. However, despite delayed transmigration caused by anti-CD47 mAbs, the number of PMN that eventually migrate is the same as that observed with isotype-matched binding controls. Cell surface labeling and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate increased CD47 on the PMN cell surface after stimulation with fMLP and after transmigration. PMN subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that increased cell surface CD47 is derived from intracellular membranes that co-sediment with the secondary (specific) granules. Experiments performed to investigate potential signaling pathways revealed that inhibition of PI3K partially reversed anti-CD47 mediated inhibition of migration while also directly enhancing the rate of PMN migration in a fashion that paralleled a rapid increase of PMN cell surface CD47. Additional inhibitor studies revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation inhibition by genistein reversed anti-CD47 effect in a near complete fashion. In further support of the notion that cell surface CD47 positively regulates the rate of migration, we found that transfection of CD47 into deficient epithelial cells (CaCO2) results in enhanced PMN transepithelial migration. Taken together, these results suggest that translocation of CD47 to the cell surface and tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling events are key components that determine the rate of PMN migration in an inflammatory response. T84 cells (passages 60–80) were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 15 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 14 mm NaHCO3, 40 µg/ml penicillin, 8 µg/ml ampicillin, 90 µg/ml streptomycin, and 6% newborn calf serum. Cells were subcultured or harvested every 6–8 days with 0.1% trypsin and 1.0 mm EDTA in Ca2+ and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. For transmigration experiments, T84 cells were grown on collagen-coated, permeable polycarbonate filters (5-µm pore size) with a surface area of 0.33 cm2 (Costar, Cambridge, MA) as previously described (12Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Liang T.W. Nusrat A. Bacarra A.E. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). CaCO2 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfected CaCO2 cells (CaCO2-pCB6 and CaCO2-CD47) were maintained in the same medium containing 1 mg/ml G418. PMN were isolated from whole blood of normal human volunteers as previously described (12Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Liang T.W. Nusrat A. Bacarra A.E. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Isolated PMN were resuspended in modified Hanks' balanced salt solution devoid of calcium or magnesium (HBSS(−)) (4 °C) at a concentration of 5 × 107 cells/ml and used within 4 h of isolation. C5D5, a functionally inhibitory mAb (IgG1) was produced in our laboratory as previously reported (12Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Liang T.W. Nusrat A. Bacarra A.E. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). B6H12.2, another functionally inhibitory anti-CD47 mAb (IgG1) (13Cooper D. Lindberg F.P. Gamble J.R. Brown E.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3978-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) was purified from supernatants of hybridoma cells obtained from the American Tissue Culture Co. CD47 mAbs PF2.1, PF3.1, and PF10.2 were produced in our laboratory by immunizing female balb/C mice with CD47 immunopurified from 50 g of human spleen cells using previously described methods (12Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Liang T.W. Nusrat A. Bacarra A.E. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Splenocytes from immunized mice were fused with P3U1 myeloma cells and cultured in selection media containing DBA-2 feeder thymocytes. Hybridoma supernatants were screened for reactivity with purified CD47 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in concert with cell surface staining by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry on T84 epithelial cells and PMN. Hybridomas were then subcloned by limiting dilution, weaned from selection media, and injected into the peritoneal cavities of balb/C mice for ascites fluid production. Antibodies were purified using protein-A-Sepharose affinity chromatography and dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Monoclonal antibody PF3.1 was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose at 2–3 mg/ml described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used for immunoprecipitation of CD47. A polyclonal antibody (R12989) was also produced by immunizing rabbits with synthetic peptide SNQKTIQPPRNN, corresponding to a region of the putative C terminus of CD47 (15Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). As a non-inhibitory binding control, mAb J3F.1 (mouse IgG1) reactive with human junction adhesion molecule (JAM) was used (29Liu Y. Nusrat A. Schnell F.J. Reaves T.A. Walsh S. Pochet M. Parkos C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2363-2374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to CD47, JAM is a transmembrane IgV superfamily member expressed on the surfaces of both PMN and epithelial cells (29Liu Y. Nusrat A. Schnell F.J. Reaves T.A. Walsh S. Pochet M. Parkos C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2363-2374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a positive functionally inhibitory control, anti-CD11b mAb CBMR1/29, was used (30Balsam L.B. Liang T.W. Parkos C.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5058-5065PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-β3 integrin mAbs 15, 33, 27, and LIBs-1 were kind gifts from Dr. Mark Ginsberg. LM609 was kindly provided by Dr. David Cherish. An additional anti-β3 mAb AP1 was purchased from GTI Inc. A functionally blocking mAb to β1 integrin, mAb 13, was kindly provided by Dr. Kenneth Yamada. Purified human thrombospondin-1 (TS1) and anti-TS1 polyclonal antibody R1 were kindly provided by Dr. Jack Lawler (31Sipes J.M. Krutzsch H.C. Lawler J. Roberts D.D. J. Biol.

Rabbit polyclonal antibody against human CD11b R7928A was raised by immunizing rabbit with a peptide (DMMSEGGPPGAEPQ) corresponding to the C terminus of CD11b. Peptide 4N1K (KRFYVVMWKK) corresponding to the C-terminal cell binding domain of thrombospondin, which has previously been shown to bind to CD47-transfected cells (18Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B.

Cell. 1998; 9: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), was synthesized and high performance liquid chromatography-purified to >90% by the Emory Microchemical Facility. PMN transepithelial migration experiments were performed using epithelial monolayers as previously described (12Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Liang T.W. Nusrat A. Bacarra A.E. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent T84 or CaCO2 monolayers were washed twice with HBSS (20 °C). PMN (1 × 106) in 150 µl of HBSS with or without antibody was added to the upper chamber of the monolayer setup. Transmigration was initiated by adding 1 ml of 1 µm fMLP (in HBSS) into the lower chamber followed by incubation at 37 °C. PMN migration across monolayers into the fMLP-containing lower chambers was quantified by myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay as previously described (12Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Liang T.W. Nusrat A. Bacarra A.E. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To assay the time course of PMN transmigration, the upper chambers of Transwell devices containing PMN and monolayers were gently moved to new wells containing 1 ml of 1 µm fMLP in 24-well plates at every 30 min as depicted in Fig. 1. PMN migration into the lower chambers at the different time periods was then analyzed by MPO assay. To assay the PMN associated with epithelial monolayers, transmigration was stopped at different time points, and monolayers were washed with HBSS and lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100. Monolayer lysates were then assayed for myeloperoxidase. Apical to basolateral PMN transepithelial migration was performed similarly except that twice as many PMN (2 × 106) were added onto the upper chamber. Additional transmigration experiments were performed using collagen-coated filters devoid of epithelial cells. For these experiments, 20 µl of a PMN suspension containing 1 × 106 cells was stimulated to transmigrate from the upper chamber to the lower chamber containing 0.1 µm fMLP. A number of signal transduction pathway inhibitors were tested for the ability to reverse the effects of anti-CD47 mAbs on PMN transmigration. For these experiments, PMN were pre-treated for 15–60 min with the following agents prior to use in transfilter migration assays: 50–100 nm wortmannin or 20–100 µm LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor (Sigma Chemical Co.)), 0.5 µm straurosporine (PKC and other kinases inhibitor (Biomol)), 10–200 µg/ml genistein (tyrosine phosphorylation inhibitor) and its analog daidzein (both from Biomol), 0.1 µm AG126 (tyrosine phosphorylation inhibitor (Biomol)), 40 µm PP1 (Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Biomol)), 20 µm SB203580 (mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor (Biomol)), 20 µm PD-98059 (MEK inhibitor (Biomol)), 10 µmU73122 (phospholipase C inhibitor (Biomol)), 1 mm propranolol (phospholipase D inhibitor (Biomol)), 1 µm GF109203X (PKC inhibitor (Biomol)), 20 µm AG490 (Jak kinase inhibitor (Biomol)), 20 µm H-8 (PKA/G inhibitor (Biomol)), 10 µm H-89 (PKA inhibitor (Biomol)), etc. Control migration was done in the presence of the same dilution of vehicle (Me2SO) in HBSS. For G-protein pathway inhibition experiments, PMN were pre-treated with 200–2000 ng/ml pertussis toxin (Calbiochem) for 2 h at 37 °C before use in migration assays. Surface CD47 labeling was performed by incubation of 100 µl of non-permeabilized PMN (5 × 106 cells) with anti-CD47 mAb C5D5 (20 µg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C in HBSS after blocking nonspecific binding with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After washing, PMN were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200 dilution in HBSS) (PharMingen) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by wash before flow cytometric analysis. CD47 labeling in this condition was compared to that obtained with normal mouse IgG1. To assay PMN surface CD47 expression during transmigration, PMN that remained in the upper chambers or had migrated into the lower chambers of Transwell setups were cooled on ice after various migration time periods followed by antibody labeling and flow cytometry. Cell surface CD47 on PMN was also assessed after PMN were stimulated with fMLP. In these experiments, 5 × 106 PMN in 2 ml of HBSS were allowed to settle in 24-well or 6-well non-tissue culture plates at room temperature for 5 min. fMLP was then added (50 nm) followed by incubation at 37 °C for various time periods. Cells were then chilled on ice and labeling performed as above. PMN (1.5 × 107/ml), in suspension or adherent to 6-well plates, were stimulated with fMLP followed by cell surface biotinylation with 0.5 mg of sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) in 1 ml of HBSS for 1 h on ice. Excess free Biotin was washed off and quenched with 100 mmNH4Cl. Cells were then solubilized with lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 2 mm Mg Cl2, 1% Triton, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1 µg/ml pepstatin. Cell lysates (200–400 µg of total protein) were precleared with control IgG before incubation with 10 µl of PF3.1-Sepharose (conjugated at 2 mg of antibody/ml of Sepharose) for 3 h (4 °C). Washed immunoprecipitates were boiled in 100 µl of sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to nitrocellulose. Nonspecific binding was blocked by 5% nonfat dry milk in TTBS (50 mm Tris. HCl, 200 nm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Biotin-labeled cell surface CD47 was detected with streptavidin-peroxidase followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)). Total CD47 was detected by blotting with polyclonal rabbit anti-CD47 antibody R12989 (1:200) and was visualized with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary and ECL. Freshly isolated, unstimulated, and fMLP-stimulated PMN (2 × 108/per condition) were resuspended in 5 ml of nitrogen cavitation buffer (0.34m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa2ATP, pH 7.4) followed by lysis by nitrogen cavitation (15 min, 400 p.s.i.) (4 °C). The lysates were centrifuged (1000 × g) and supernatants were then subjected to isopycnic sucrose density gradient fractionation on linear 20–55% sucrose gradients in a Beckman SW-28 swinging bucket rotor (100,000 × g; 3 h, 4 °C) exactly as previously described (33Parkos C.A. Cochrane C.G. Schmitt M. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6541-6547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1.5-ml fractions were collected from each gradient and analyzed for sucrose density, protein, plasma membrane (alkaline phosphatase), primary granules (myeloperoxidase), and secondary granules (lactoferrin) as previously described (33Parkos C.A. Cochrane C.G. Schmitt M. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6541-6547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The entire protein coding region of CD47 was PCR-amplified from reverse-transcribed human colonic cDNA with primers C3 (sense) (5′-atgataagcttcctgcatgtggcccctggtagcg) and C6 (antisense) (5′-agcttctagactactctccaaatcggagtccat) located at the 5′-untranslated repeat and 3′-untranslated repeat, respectively. Amplified PCR product was digested with HindIII/XbaI and cloned into pCB6, which had been predigested with the same restriction endonucleases. CaCO2 cells were transfected with pCB6-CD47 or pCB6 (control transfection) using Lipofectin reagent as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable transfectants were selected by culturing in DMEM containing 1.2 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell surface expression of CD47 was confirmed by immunofluorescence labeling and FACS analysis. The putative extracellular domain of human CD47, including the signal peptide, was PCR-amplified by primers C3(5′-atgataagcttcctgcatgtggcccctggtagcgg) and C4 (5′-ttgattagatctatttggagaaaaccatga) from reverse-transcribed T84 cDNA. The DNA fragment was cloned into the mammalian expression vector AP-tag2 (34Cheng H.J. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 1994; 79: 157-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), which contains the catalytic domain of human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) at the C terminus, throughBglII and HindIII restriction sites. After transformation, at least three independent clones were isolated and the entire protein-coding region was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient transfections of COS-7 were performed using a standard DEAE-dextran method (35Liu Y. The Mechanism of GAG Autoproteolytic Activation and Enzyme Catalysis.Ph.D. dissertation. University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL1997Google Scholar). Protein expression and secretion was monitored by assaying AP activity in cell culture medium (34Cheng H.J. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 1994; 79: 157-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Expressed CD47-AP fusion protein in medium was affinity-purified by PF3.1-Sepharose and eluted with 10 mm TEA/HCl buffer containing 100 mmNaCl, pH 10.5, followed by neutralization, concentration, and dialysis. Previously, we demonstrated that anti-CD47 mAb C5D5 inhibited PMN migration across T84 monolayers (12Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Liang T.W. Nusrat A. Bacarra A.E. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, we noticed that the efficiency of inhibition by C5D5 or another anti-CD47 antibody, B6H12.2 (13Cooper D. Lindberg F.P. Gamble J.R. Brown E.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3978-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), was variable in the standard transmigration assays typically consisting of a single time point (normally 2 h). We surmised that the variable inhibition observed might be the result of differences in PMN motility after CD47 inhibition. To address this and further investigate the mechanism of CD47-mediated migration, we modified the in vitro transepithelial migration assay in which PMN migration was assessed at several time points (Fig. 1). Using this assay setup, we tested the effect of inhibitory anti-CD47 mAbs C5D5 and B6H12.2 on the time course of PMN migration across T84 monolayers. As controls, parallel experiments were performed with binding, non-inhibitory isotype-matched anti-JAM mAb J3F.1 (29Liu Y. Nusrat A. Schnell F.J. Reaves T.A. Walsh S. Pochet M. Parkos C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2363-2374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an inhibitory control antibody reactive with CD11b CD18 (CBRM1/29 (30Balsam L.B. Liang T.W. Parkos C.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5058-5065PubMed Google Scholar)). As shown in Fig. 2A, in the presence of control non-inhibitory mAbs, less than 10% of the total applied PMN migrated across T84 monolayers during the first 30 min (5.8 ± 0.6% for no antibody and 6.1 ± 2.0% for J3F.1). Massive PMN migration across T84 monolayers occurred during the next 30-min period (2nd 30′) with ∼40% of the applied PMN migrating into the lower chambers (43.6 ± 3.7% for no antibody and 38.7 ± 4.4% for J3F.1). In the third 30-min period (3rd 30′), PMN migration into the lower chamber decreased to 14.6 ± 2.9% for no antibody and 16.8 ± 5.2% for J3F.1. In subsequent time periods, PMN migration across the monolayers continued to decrease to <10% in the fourth 30 min and to <5% in the fifth and sixth 30-min periods, respectively. From Fig. 2 A, total migration of PMN into the lower chamber can be plotted as a function of migration time, which is shown in Fig. 2 B. As can be seen, under non-in"

To test whether these antigenic peptides may be inherently resistant to cytosolic peptidases, six different antigenic peptides were incubated with HeLa cell extracts. All six were degraded rapidly by a process involving o-phenanthroline-sensitive metallopeptidases. One antigenic peptide, FAPGNYPAL, was rapidly destroyed in the extracts by a bestatin-sensitive exopeptidase, apparently by the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase.

Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). Once generated, the antigenic peptides are transported by the TAP complex from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they bind to MHC class I molecules and are then transported to the cell surface (1Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 11York I.A. Goldberg A.L. Mo X.Y. Rock K.L. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 49-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In degrading polypeptides, proteasomes generate peptides ranging from 3 to 25 residues in length (12Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N.

Rammensee H.G. Nature. 1991; 351: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar), because they are rapidly hydrolyzed to amino acids. Efficient breakdown of proteasome products is essential to supply amino acids for the synthesis of new proteins, but rapid breakdown of these peptides is probably also important to prevent the build up of protein fragments that might interfere with critical protein-protein interactions in the cell. The enzymes responsible for this rapid hydrolysis of proteasome products have not been identified, nor is it clear how the MHC-presented peptides can escape this degradative fate and serve in antigen presentation. In fact it is presently unknown whether antigenic peptides, once formed, are inherently stable in the cytosol or are susceptible to the peptidase(s) that degrade completely the great majority of proteasome products. One theoretical possibility is that these antigenic peptides are inherently resistant to cytosolic peptidases. Alternatively, formation of a complex between antigenic peptides and chaperones might in principle protect them from further degradation and may even help to shuttle them to the TAP complex. It has been proposed that antigenic peptides may be stabilized in the cytosol by binding to the heat shock proteins, Hsp70 and Hsp90 (15Srivastava P.K. Udono H. Blachere N.E. Li Z. Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In fact, longer versions of an antigenic peptide have been found to be associated in the cell extracts with an unidentified high molecular weight protein, apparently distinct from Hsp70 (16Paz P. Brouwenstijn N. Perry R. Shastri N. Immunity. 1999; 11: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that antigenic peptides may escape destruction in the cytosol, because they may be generated by proteasomes attached to the TAP complex and transported directly to the ER (17Hirsch C. Ploegh H.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 268-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); however, many investigators have tried, but failed to demonstrate such an association of TAP and proteasomes. There is also clear evidence that antigenic peptides can be modified by cytosolic exopeptidases. It had long been assumed that the proteasome releases the mature epitopes directly (18Niedermann G. Grimm R. Geier E. Maurer M. Realini C. Gartmann C. Soll J. Omura S. Rechsteiner M.C. Baumeister W. Eichmann K. J. Exp.

Med. 2000; 191: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, there is growing evidence that antigenic peptides can be released by 26 S proteasomes as longer precursors that undergo trimming in the cytosol or ER to yield the presented epitopes. If introduced in the cytosol, such N-extended versions can be efficiently trimmed to the presented epitope by cytosolic exopeptidases (16Paz P. Brouwenstijn N. Perry R. Shastri N. Immunity. 1999; 11: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 20Craiu A. Akopian T. Goldberg A. Rock K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 2000; 1: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In recent studies, pure proteasomes have been shown to generate from ovalbumin primarily longer versions of the immunodominant epitope SIINFEKL, which contain 1–8 additional residues on its N terminus (24Cascio P. Hilton C. Kisselev A.F. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2357-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that interferon-γ, which stimulates class I presentation, induces specialized forms of the proteasome (often termed immunoproteasomes), which have been found to produce these N-extended versions of antigenic peptides at increased rates (24Cascio P. Hilton C. Kisselev A.F. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2357-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and also have been shown to induce the leucine aminopeptidase, the cytosolic peptidase most active in trimming such longer precursors to the MHC-presented epitopes (21Beninga J. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18734-18742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 25Harris C.A. Hunte B. Krauss M.R. Taylor A. Epstein L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6865-6869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, peptide metabolism in the cytosol can be an important factor determining the extent of antigen presentation. The present studies were undertaken to learn whether antigenic peptides and also N-extended precursors, like other proteasome products, are susceptible to proteolytic digestion in the cytosol. We show here that such peptides are quite labile in cell extracts and that a key enzyme responsible for degradation of most, but not all, peptides studied is the endopeptidase, thimet oligopeptidase (TOP, EC 3.4.24.15) (26Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Dando P.M. Knight C.G. McKie N. Rawlings N.D. Serizawa A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 529-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The physiological function(s) of this enzyme have long been unclear. Although primarily cytosolic, this peptidase may also exist in membrane-associated forms in certain cells (27Crack P.J. Wu T.J. Cummins P.M. Ferro E.S. Tullai J.W. Glucksman M.J. Roberts J.L. Brain Res. 1999; 835: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and a variety of roles for it have been suggested, especially in neuropeptide metabolism (28Carvalho K.M. Camargo A.C.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7082-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Orlowski M. Michaud C. Chu T.G. Eur. J.

Surprisingly, TOP has been reported to bind tightly antigenic peptides, but not to degrade them (31Portaro F.C.V. Gomes M.D. Cabrera A. Fernandes B.L. Silva C.L. Ferro E.S. Juliano L. Camargo A.C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was proposed that the binding of antigenic peptides to TOP may protect them from intracellular destruction (31Portaro F.C.V. Gomes M.D. Cabrera A. Fernandes B.L. Silva C.L. Ferro E.S. Juliano L. Camargo A.C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 32Silva C.L. Portaro F.C.V. Bonato V.L.D. Camargo A.C.M. Ferro E.S. Biochem.

Shen, C. R. Abraham, A. L. Goldberg, and K. L. Rock, submitted for publication. indicate that this enzyme destroys antigenic peptides in the cytosol and thus is an important new factor that limits the efficiency of antigen presentationin vivo. A variety of known antigenic peptides, whose presentation has been extensively studied in vivo, were examined. Peptides were synthesized by Macromolecular Resources (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO) or the Dana Farber Cancer Research Institute core facility (Boston, MA) and were at least 90% pure by HPLC analysis. The peptides were dissolved at 10 mg/ml in Me2SO and stored at 80 °C. The internally quenched fluorogenic substrate Mcc-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-d-Lys (Dnp)-OH (Mcc-PLGPK-Dnp) and the inhibitor Cpp-AAF-pAb were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (San Diego, CA). The fluorogenic substrate for prolyl oligopeptidase (Z-GP-Amc), tripeptidyl peptidase II (AAF-Amc) and aminopeptidases (A-Amc, L-Amc, R-Amc) were obtained from Bachem (Basel, Switzerland). Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B and Protein G-Sepharose 4B Fast Flow, bestatin, o-phenanthroline, PMSF, and E64 were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant human interferon γ was kindly provided by Biogen Inc. (Cambridge, MA). The proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Cbz-Leu-Leu-leucinal) was provided by ProScript Inc. (Cambridge, MA), and phosphinic peptide inhibitor of TOP, Cbz-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Ala-Arg-Phe-OH, was a kind gift of Dr. V. Dive (DIEP/DSV, CEA, Gif sur Yvette, France). Recombinant rat thimet oligopeptidase was provided by Dr. P. Dando and Dr. A. Barrett (Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and also by Dr. A. C. M. Camargo (Instituto Butantan, Sao Paulo, Brazil) and Dr. E. Ferro (Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil). Recombinant human puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase was obtained from Dr. L. B. Hersh (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). Monoclonal, murine TOP antibody was provided by Dr. C. Abraham (Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA), and the polyclonal rat TOP antiserum was a kind gift of Dr. E. Ferro. Rabbit antisera against LMP2 and PA28α were obtained from Dr. K. Tanaka. Rabbit antiserum against purified bovine leucine aminopeptidase was generated in this laboratory. Monoclonal antibody 9B12 against human insulin-degrading enzyme was a gift from Dr. R. Roth (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Monoclonal antibody against proteasomal α-subunit HC3 was purchased from Affinity Research Products, Ltd. (Mamhead, United Kingdom). The human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa S3 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irving Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. HeLa S3 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes containing 10 ml of culture medium and were treated for different periods of time with 150 units/ml interferon γ, as detailed in figure legends. Cells from confluent cultures were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and were removed into a homogenization buffer by using a cell lifter. Cells were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer and by vortexing with glass beads in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 mm sucrose. Extracts were prepared by centrifugation of the homogenates for 10 min at 20,000 × g and for 1 h at 100,000 ×g. Most of the proteasomes were removed by an additional 6-h centrifugation at 100,000 × g. All extracts were stored at −80 °C until use. The residual proteasomal activity in the extracts was inhibited by pre-incubation with 20 μmMG132 for 15 min at room temperature. Protein concentration in the extracts was determined with the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce). Fractionation of 0.5 mg of HeLa cell extract (100,000 ×g, 6-h supernatant) was performed by ion exchange chromatography on a 1-ml MonoQ 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% Brij 35. Bound proteins were eluted with a 20-min linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 msodium chloride and with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The protein elution profiles were measured at 280 nm, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected for further analysis. Hydrolysis of fluorogenic peptide substrates was measured in a continuous assay at 37 °C with 10 μg of HeLa cell extract and the specific fluorogenic substrate in a 500-μl volume of 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. Thimet oligopeptidase activity was analyzed using the quenched fluorogenic substrate, Mcc-PLGPK-Dnp, at 20 μm, and the fluorescent product was measured at an excitation wavelength of 345 nm and an emission wavelength of 405 nm in a SLM Aminco luminescence spectrometer. The activity of prolyl oligopeptidase was measured with Z-GP-Amc at 100 μm final concentration. The release of Amc was monitored at excitation/emission wavelengths of 380/460 nm. The tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPP-II) was assayed with 100 μmAAF-Amc in the presence of the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin. The activity of cytosolic aminopeptidases was determined with 100 μm A-Amc or L-Amc. Five nmol of the antigenic peptides were incubated at 37 °C for various time intervals with 10 μg of HeLa extract in 100 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μm MG132. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid followed by a 15-min incubation on ice and removal of the precipitated protein by centrifugation for 15 min at 20,000 × g. The peptide-containing supernatant was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC on a 4.6 × 250-mm Vydac 5-μm C18 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) in 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elution was performed with a 30-min linear gradient from 5 to 60% acetonitrile. The eluting peptides were calculated by integration of peptide peaks on chromatograms and are given in arbitrary units (21Beninga J. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18734-18742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To study the effects of inhibitors, the extracts were preincubated with the indicated inhibitors for 30 min at room temperature. In order to immobilize antibodies to Protein A-Sepharose, the 25 μl of settled resin was first incubated with 20 μl of rabbit pre-immune serum or 20 μl of rabbit TOP antiserum for 40 min at room temperature in 300 μl of immunodepletion buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.6, containing 140 mm NaCl, 10 mmKCl). Serum proteins were washed away, and 400 μg of HeLa cytosol (300 μl) was added to each resin. After continuous mixing for 2 h at 4 °C, resins were removed by quick centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 s. To ensure complete immunodepletion of the enzyme, the HeLa cytosol from the first round of immunodepletion was added to a second set of Protein A-Sepharose resins pre-adsorbed with the non-immune or TOP antiserum. These samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After removing the resin by centrifugation, HeLa cytosol was transferred to new tubes and stored at −80 °C until analysis. The immunodepletion of the IDE was performed by pre-incubating 400 μg of HeLa cytosol with 5 μg of IDE monoclonal antibodies 9B12 for 2 h in a reaction volume of 300 μl. Protein G-Sepharose was then added to remove antibody-enzyme complexes. After a 2 h incubation at 4 °C, resins were removed by centrifugation and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. IDE antibodies were added for the second round of immunodepletion, which continued as described above. In control reactions, HeLa extract was treated only with Protein G-Sepharose and no antibodies or only with monoclonal antibodies but no Protein G-Sepharose. The extent of TOP and IDE immunodepletion was assessed by Western blotting with TOP antiserum and IDE 9B12 antibodies. In addition, the depletion of TOP was also monitored in an assay with the fluorogenic TOP substrate, Mcc-PLGPK-Dnp. Two rounds of immunodepletion left only small amounts of TOP and IDE in the HeLa extract, as determined by Western blotting, and reduced the degradation of TOP-substrate Mcc-PLGPK-Dnp by 82%. The levels of these enzymes were not affected in control reactions containing only Protein G- or Protein A-Sepharose or only antibodies. Additionally, these procedures did not affect the activities of other cytosolic enzymes tested (e.g. prolyl oligopeptidase and aminopeptidases). The identification and quantification of thimet oligopeptidase in soluble extracts was done by separation of 10 μg of HeLa extract or 40 μl of each sample from fractionated extracts on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by transfer of the proteins to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore). The membranes were blocked for 30 min at room temperature with 0.5% milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated overnight at 4 °C with specific primary antibodies or antiserum. Bound antibodies on the immunoblots were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Signals were developed by ECL with the alkaline phosphatase substrate, CDP-Star (Tropix, Bedford, MA). To determine whether antigenic peptides once formed, are stable in the cytosol or can be degraded by cellular peptidases, we established an HPLC assay to follow the fate of a number of antigenic peptides added to soluble extracts of HeLa cells. The six peptides were incubated with high-speed (100,000 × g, 6 h) supernatants, and at different times the remaining peptides were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC. The following six antigenic peptides were studied: ASNENMETM (influenzavirus nucleoprotein, Flu NP, residues 366–374), SIINFEKL (ovalbumin, residues 257–264), TYQRTRALV (Flu NP, residues 147–154), RGPGRAFVTI (human immunodeficiency virus gp160, residues 318–327), TPHPARIGL (β-galactosidase, residues 876–884), and FAPGNYPAL (Sendai virus nucleoprotein, residues 324–332). All these peptides had previously been found associated with murine MHC class I alleles and shown to induce a T cell immune response (33Rammensee H.G. Friede T. Stevanoviic S. Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 178-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). Consequently, they have often been used in studies of antigen presentation. At the outset of the incubation, the only peptide peak detectable in the non-dialyzed extracts was the added peptide. The failure to find any endogenous peptides in the cytosol is consistent with earlier observation (14Falk K. Rotzschke O. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H.G. Nature. 1991; 351: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar). None of these added peptides were stable in the cell extracts at 37 °C. Peptides were studied at concentrations (50–100 μm), which allowed their degradation to be followed over convenient time periods. Rates of degradation were also dependent on extract concentration, and a concentration was chosen to facilitate the analysis. After 3 h, the amounts of all the peptides studied had decreased by 70–100%, but the rates of disappearance of different peptides varied widely (Fig.1). Four peptides (ASNENMETM, SIINFEKL, TYQRTRALV, TPHPARIGL) were degraded relatively slowly; i.e.∼50% disappeared after 40–100 min under these conditions, while two peptides RGPGRAFVTI and FAPGNYPAL were degraded much more rapidly (i.e. at least 50% of each disappeared within 30 min). To identify the enzymes responsible for peptide degradation, we initially analyzed the effects of different peptidase inhibitors on the disappearance of the Flu NP-derived antigenic 9-mer, ASNENMETM, and the ovalbumin-derived 8-mer, SIINFEKL. Addition to the extract of the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin (100 μm) reduced the degradation of these peptides only slightly (TableI), even though this concentration of bestatin inhibited almost completely the activity of the major cytosolic aminopeptidases, leucine aminopeptidase and the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase against fluorogenic substrates (data not shown). High concentrations of PMSF (1 mm) and E64 (100 μm) caused no inhibition, which argues against the participation of serine and cysteine proteases. By contrast, the metal chelator o-phenanthroline (1 mm) almost completely blocked the degradation of these peptides and also the more rapid digestion of FAPGNYPAL (see below). Thus, metalloendopeptidase(s) appear to be responsible for the degradation of all these peptides (Table I).Table IEffects of protease inhibitors on the degradation of the influenzavirus nucleoprotein-derived antigenic peptide, ASNENMETM, and the ovalbumin-derived peptide, SIINFEKL, in HeLa cell extractInhibitorConcentrationProteases inhibitedInhibitionASNENMETMSIINFEKL%Bestatin100 μmAminopeptidases614PMSF1 mmSerine33E64100 μmCysteine012o-Phenanthroline1 mmMetalloproteases89100Butabindide1 μmTripeptidyl peptidase II00Peptides (50 nmol/ml) were incubated for 2 h with 100 μg/ml HeLa extract in the presence or absence of these inhibitors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reactions were linear and were stopped when ∼50–60% of substrate (in the absence of any inhibitor) was degraded, and peptide levels were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC. Percentage of inhibition was calculated from peak areas obtained by integration of reverse phase HPLC peaks of peptides incubated with or without inhibitors. Because the stated ultracentrifugation removed more than 85% of TPP-II, the effect of inhibitor butabindide was assayed in HeLa extract centrifuged only at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and similar results were obtained. At this concentration, butabindide almost completely inhibited TPP-II, as determined by its effect on bestatin-insensitive AAF-Amc degradation in the extracts. These results are representative of at least two independent experiments.

However, in additional experiments, a similar breakdown of ASNENMETM, SIINFEKL, and FAPGNYPAL was seen in crude extracts containing active proteasomes. In these preparations, their degradation was also sensitive to the metallopeptidase inhibitor and was not significantly affected by a proteasome inhibitor (data not shown). The ultracentrifugation step did not reduce activity of various soluble peptidases (e.g.thimet oligopeptidase, prolyl oligopeptidase, aminopeptidases, or insul"

Here we have investigated the role of the classical progesterone receptor in this nongenomic signaling. TheXenopus progesterone receptor (XPR) was predominantly cytoplasmic; however, a significant fraction (∼5%) of one form of the receptor (p82 XPR) was associated with the plasma membrane-containing P-10,000 fraction, compatible with the observation that membrane-impermeant derivatives of progesterone can induce maturation. XPR co-precipitated with active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor wortmannin delayed progesterone-induced maturation and completely blocked the insulin-dependent maturation, indicating that the association of XPR with PI3-K could be functionally important. We also examined whether the nongenomic signaling properties of XPR can account for the ability of glucocorticoids and the progesterone antagonist RU486 to induce maturation. We found that none of these steroids cause XPR to become associated with active PI3-K; thus, association of XPR with active PI3-K is progesterone-specific. Finally, we showed that p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) associates with XPR after progesterone-induced germinal vesicle breakdown and that active recombinant MAPK is able to phosphorylate p110 XPR in vitro. These findings demonstrate that the classical progesterone receptor is involved in progesterone-induced nongenomic signaling inXenopus oocytes and provide evidence that p42 MAPK and PI3-K activity are directly associated with the classical progesterone receptor.

One physiologically important process that clearly depends upon nontranscriptional effects of steroid hormones is the maturation of fish and amphibian oocytes. Maturation is the series of events through which a fully grown oocyte becomes ready for ovulation and fertilization (8Maller J.L. Biol.

The steroid hormones progesterone (in frogs) or 17α,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (in fish) cause the oocyte to undergo germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD),1 condense its chromosomes and organize a meiotic spindle, complete the first meiotic division, enter meiosis II, and then arrest in metaphase of meiosis II. Steroids may be important in the regulation of mammalian oocyte maturation as well (11Byskov A.G. Andersen C.Y. Leonardsen L. Baltsen M. J. Exp.

Progesterone can induce germinal vesicle breakdown in the presence of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (14Schuetz A.W. J. Exp. Zool. 1967; 166: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and can trigger Cdc2 activation in oocytes whose nuclei have been microsurgically removed (15Masui Y. Markert C.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1971; 177: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 16Smith L.D. Ecker R.E. Dev. Biol. 1969; 19: 281-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cdc2 activation is weaker and less sustained in enucleate Xenopus oocytes than it is in intact oocytes (17Iwashita J. Hayano Y. Sagata N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4392-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); nevertheless, it does occur. These findings demonstrate that nontranscriptional effects are of central importance in progesterone-induced oocyte maturation. The nongenomic effects of progesterone on oocytes could be mediated either by a classical steroid hormone receptor or by some novel type of steroid hormone receptor. Until recently, it was generally believed that the latter was the case, based on several observations. First, progesterone is more effective in inducing maturation when applied to the outside of an oocyte than it is when microinjected into the cytoplasm or nucleus, consistent with a plasma membrane localization for the maturation-inducing receptor (15Masui Y. Markert C.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1971; 177: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 18Smith L.D. Ecker R.E. Dev. Biol. 1971; 25: 232-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In addition, steroids immobilized on agarose beads (19Ishikawa K. Hanaoka Y. Kondo Y. Imai K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1977; 9: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or covalently coupled to a synthetic polymer (20Godeau J.F. Schorderet-Slatkine S. Hubert P. Baulieu E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) can still induce maturation. Since classical steroid hormone receptors are generally found in the cytoplasm or nucleus, the receptor responsible for oocyte maturation was thought not to be a classical steroid hormone receptor. In addition, progesterone can cause rapid, GTP-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in washed oocyte membranes (21Sadler S.E. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6368-6373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sadler S.E. Maller J.L. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1985; 19: 179-194PubMed Google Scholar, 23Finidori-Lepicard J. Schorderet-Slatkine S. Hanoune J. Baulieu E.E. Nature. 1981; 292: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This supports the idea that the progesterone receptor may be localized to the membrane and suggests that the plasma membrane progesterone receptor is a seven-pass, G-protein-coupled receptor. Two recent papers have prompted reexamination of the idea that the oocyte receptor is something other than a classical steroid hormone receptor (24Bayaa M. Booth R.A. Sheng Y. Liu X.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12607-12612Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 25Tian J. Kim S. Heilig E. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14358-14363Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Both papers reported the cloning and characterization of cDNAs for Xenopus homologs of the classical progesterone receptor, one of which appears to represent a complete cDNA, designated XPR-1 (25Tian J. Kim S. Heilig E. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14358-14363Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The XPR-1 sequence shows high similarity to the mammalian progesterone receptor proteins in the C-terminal hormone binding domain and central DNA binding domain and more limited similarity in the N-terminal region that is present in mammalian PR-B proteins and absent from the smaller PR-A proteins (26Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Both groups presented evidence that this classical progesterone receptor plays a role in progesterone-induced maturation. Injection of a truncated XPR mRNA was found to accelerate progesterone-induced Mos synthesis, p42 MAPK activation, and oocyte maturation, showing that a classical steroid hormone receptor can promote maturation (24Bayaa M. Booth R.A. Sheng Y. Liu X.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12607-12612Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 25Tian J. Kim S. Heilig E. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14358-14363Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The transcription inhibitor actinomycin D did not affect the ability of XPR to promote maturation (24Bayaa M. Booth R.A. Sheng Y. Liu X.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12607-12612Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 25Tian J. Kim S. Heilig E. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14358-14363Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition, XPR-1 antisense oligonucleotides were found to inhibit progesterone-induced maturation, and co-injection of sense XPR or human PR-B mRNAs restored progesterone-induced maturation (25Tian J. Kim S. Heilig E. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14358-14363Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These findings support the hypothesis that oocyte maturation is mediated by nontranscriptional effects of a classical progesterone receptor. However, there are a number of aspects of steroid-induced oocyte maturation that are difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that it is mediated by XPR-1 (27Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The first is the apparent localization of the maturation-inducing progesterone receptor to the plasma membrane. Although some classical steroid hormone receptors have been found to associate with the plasma membrane when overexpressed (28Razandi M. Pedram A. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar), Bayaaet al. reported that endogenous XPR-1 is exclusively cytosolic (24Bayaa M. Booth R.A. Sheng Y. Liu X.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12607-12612Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). If so, it would seem unlikely that XPR-1 mediates the progesterone-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in washed membrane preparations or the induction of maturation by immobilized steroids. In addition, a diverse group of nonprogesterone-like steroids, including the glucocorticoids hydrocortisone and deoxycorticosterone, are potent inducers of oocyte maturation (29Baulieu E.E. Godeau F. Schorderet M. Schorderet-Slatkine S. Nature. 1978; 275: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Unless XPR-1 differs markedly from other progesterone receptors in its ability to be activated by nonprogestins, it seems unlikely that it could mediate the effects of these steroids. Here we have examined whether the location of XPR is consistent with its hypothesized role as a mediator of maturation and whether the steroid specificity of XPR-associated effects is consistent with the steroid specificity of maturation. In addition, we looked for a mechanistic connection between XPR and the signal transduction machinery of maturation. We found that mammalian progesterone receptor antibodies recognize two main protein bands in blots and immunoprecipitates of Xenopus oocyte lysates, a prominent 82-kDa band and a less prominent 110-kDa band. We found that about 5% of the oocyte's 82-kDa XPR protein can be recovered from washed oocyte membranes, indicating that XPR could initiate signals at the plasma membrane. Moreover, progesterone caused XPR to become associated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) activity. This association is detectable within 30 min of progesterone treatment and continues to increase until the time of germinal vesicle breakdown. The physical association of XPR with PI3-K provides one possible functional link between XPR and maturation. We also found that XPR becomes associated with p42 MAPK after germinal vesicle breakdown and that p42 MAPK is able to phosphorylate p110 XPR in vitro. This raises the possibility that XPR is regulated by the p42 MAPK pathway. Finally, we showed that RU486, hydrocortisone, and deoxycorticosterone, three steroids that can induce maturation but are not agonists at classical progesterone receptors, do not cause XPR to become associated with PI3-K activity. This finding suggests that although XPR may contribute to progesterone-induced maturation, it probably does not account for the maturation-inducing effects of nonprogestins. Several antibodies were obtained from commercial sources. A polyclonal anti-progesterone receptor antibody (SC-539) and its corresponding blocking peptide (SC-539P) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-CD29 was from Immunotex, mouse monoclonal anti-ERK2 (D2 SC1647) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK was from New England Biolabs. The DC3 rabbit polyclonal anti-p42 MAPK antiserum was raised against a C-terminal peptide (30Hsiao K.-M. Chou S.-y. Shih S.-J. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5480-5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal anti-N1 antibody b2–2B10 was a generous gift from C. Dreyer (31Dreyer C. Development. 1987; 101: 829-846PubMed Google Scholar). The PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin was purchased from Calbiochem, phosphatidylinositol was obtained from Avanti, and recombinant, active p42 MAPK (ERK2) was obtained from New England Biolabs. All other biochemicals, including hydrocortisone, deoxycorticosterone, and (RU486) mifepristone, were obtained from Sigma. Xenopus ovarian tissue was surgically removed, and oocytes were defolliculated for 1–1.5 h at room temperature with 2 mg/ml collagenase and 0.5 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone in Ca2+-free modified Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). The oocytes were then washed four times with modified Barth's solution. Stage VI oocytes were sorted manually and incubated at 16 °C in OR2 solution (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 50 μg/ml gentamicin for at least 10 h to allow the oocytes to recover from the collagenase treatment. Oocytes were then treated with progesterone and scored for GVBD by the appearance of a white dot at the animal pole. Frozen oocytes were thawed rapidly and lysed by pipetting up and down in 60 μl of ice-cold extraction buffer (0.25m sucrose, 0.1 m NaCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) containing 10 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μm microcystin). Samples were clarified by centrifugation for 2.5 min in a Beckman E microcentrifuge with a right angle rotor. Crude cytoplasm was collected and processed for immunoblotting as described (30Hsiao K.-M. Chou S.-y. Shih S.-J. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5480-5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Xenopus oocytes were isolated as above and homogenized in 10 volumes of membrane preparation buffer (83 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9) in a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes, pestle A). The pellet obtained at 100 × g (1100 rpm; Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge) for 10 min (P-100) contained mainly yolk platelets. Centrifugation of the supernatant at 1000 ×g (3500 rpm; Eppendorf tabletop) for 10 min gave a melanosome-enriched pellet (P-1000). The plasma membrane-containing fraction P-10,000 was obtained by centrifugation of the supernatant at 10,000 × g (11,100 rpm; Eppendorf tabletop) (32Blondeau J.P. Baulieu E.E. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The supernatant, which contained cytosol, microsomes, and small vesicles, was saved. The pellet was then overlaid once with membrane preparation buffer and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g to wash away any residual cytosol. Nuclei were isolated by mechanical dissection. Pools of 10–100 oocytes were lysed by pipetting. Lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Afterward, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PR antibody (1.4 μg) and fresh protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 3 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed once with lysis buffer, twice with buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4, and 0.15 m NaCl. In some immunoprecipitations, the PR antibody was preincubated with a 10-fold excess of blocking peptide for 30 min at 4 °C prior to binding to the protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were washed once with 0.25 msucrose, 0.1 m NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) containing 10 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μm microcystin) and twice with the same buffer without EDTA. Another wash was performed in the kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35). The kinase reaction was performed in 25 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 80 μm unlabeled ATP, and 100 units of active MAPK (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C. Pools of 100 oocytes were subjected to immunoprecipitation with PR antibody and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm dithiothreitol; twice with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m LiCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol; and once with 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The PI 3-kinase reaction was performed at room temperature for a 10-min incubation in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol, 40 μmATP, 30 mm MgCl2, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by adding 15 μl of 1 n HCl, and the lipid layer was extracted with 130 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). The lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60 plates (200-μm coating; Alltech) in chloroform/methanol/H2O/NH4OH (43:38:7:5, v/v/v/v), and phosphorylated PI was detected by autoradiography. We looked for a progesterone receptor-related protein inXenopus oocyte lysates by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody (SC-539) that recognizes both the short ∼80-kDa PR-A and longer ∼100-kDa PR-B isoforms of the mammalian progesterone receptor. In agreement with a previous report (24Bayaa M. Booth R.A. Sheng Y. Liu X.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12607-12612Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we found that oocytes possess a prominent 82-kDa PR-related protein, here designated p82 XPR (Fig.1A). Its molecular mass is compatible with its being either a full-length B-isoform of XPR-1 (predicted molecular mass 82 kDa) or an A-isoform (predicted molecular mass 72 kDa) (25Tian J. Kim S. Heilig E. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14358-14363Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). There was also a less prominent 110-kDa band that could represent a B-isoform; the mammalian B-isoforms generally migrate ∼20 kDa above their predicted molecular masses. Alternatively, p110 XPR could represent an XPR-2 protein (25Tian J. Kim S. Heilig E. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14358-14363Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) or some other related protein. Both p82 XPR and p110 XPR were immunoprecipitated by SC-539 (Fig. 1A, right panel). The peptide against which the PR antibody was raised blocked immunoprecipitation of both p82 XPR and p110 XPR (Fig. 1A, right panel). Neither the p82 nor the p110 band changed in intensity during maturation (Fig. 1, A and B); thus, progesterone treatment appeared not to alter either the abundance or immunoprecipitability of either protein. Next we examined the localization of p82 XPR and p110 XPR by subcellular fractionation. Because Bayaa et al. had observed no detectable p82 XPR in immunoblots of one oocyte's worth of washed membranes (24Bayaa M. Booth R.A. Sheng Y. Liu X.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12607-12612Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we chose to analyze larger amounts of material, 50 oocytes' worth of washed membranes/lane and five oocytes' worth of cytoplasm/lane (Fig. 1B). The p82 XPR protein was detected in both the membrane and supernatant fractions of progesterone-treated and -untreated oocytes, with roughly 5% of the p82 XPR present in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1B). Progesterone treatment did not detectably alter the partitioning of p82 XPR between membrane and cytoplasm. As controls, we examined the fractionation of a plasma membrane protein, CD29, a cytoplasmic protein, α-tubulin, and a nuclear and cytoplasmic protein, N1. The washed membrane fraction contained all of the detectable CD29, no detectable N1, and less than 0.4% of the detectable α-tubulin (Fig. 1B). Thus, the membrane-associated p82 XPR cannot be accounted for by cytoplasmic or nuclear contamination. The p110 XPR protein was detected only in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is a critical intermediary in growth factor-induced mitogenesis in somatic cells. PI3-K also becomes activated in oocytes treated with progesterone or insulin (33Muslin A.J. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6661-6666Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that the steroid hormone estradiol causes PI3-K to become activated and to associate with the ERα estrogen receptor (34Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). PI3-K activity was also found to be associated with glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone receptors in a hormone-dependent fashion (34Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). Although the same study reported that PI3-K activity did not become associated with progesterone receptors in response to progestins (34Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar), we nevertheless addressed the possibility that PI3-K might be a mechanistic link between the oocyte's classical progesterone receptors and the signal transduction of maturation. As shown in Fig. 2, PI3-K activity was found to be associated with progesterone receptor immunoprecipitates. The XPR-associated PI3-K activity began to increase within 30 min of progesterone treatment and was maximal at about the time of GVBD (Fig.2). This is similar to the time course of p85-associated PI3-K activity in progesterone-treated oocytes (33Muslin A.J. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6661-6666Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin inhibited the XPR-associated PI3-K activity, as expected if the activity were due to a bona fide PI3-K (Fig. 2). These findings show that the classical progesterone receptor is functional in Xenopus oocytes and that it rapidly engages the PI3-K pathway upon progesterone treatment. Next we examined whether other steroids that are effective at inducing GVBD also cause PI3-K activity to become associated with XPR. We treated oocytes with the glucocorticoids hydrocortisone and deoxycorticosterone, which are potent inducers of maturation (29Baulieu E.E. Godeau F. Schorderet M. Schorderet-Slatkine S. Nature. 1978; 275: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We found that 100% of the oocytes treated with either glucocorticoid matured within 3 h of hormone treatment, but neither glucocorticoid caused PI3-K activity to become associated with XPR (Fig. 3A). We also treated oocytes with mifepristone (RU486), a progesterone receptor antagonist that acts as a weak inducer of oocyte maturation (22Sadler S.E. Maller J.L. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1985; 19: 179-194PubMed Google Scholar). We found that only about 10% of the mifepristone-treated oocytes matured after an overnight incubation, but even among those oocytes that did mature, there was no detectable increase in the amount of XPR-associated PI3-K activity (Fig. 3B). Thus, the signaling properties of the classical progesterone receptor do not account for the broad steroid specificity of oocyte maturation. Mifepristone neither blocked nor augmented the progesterone-stimulated PI3-K activity in XPR immunoprecipitates and did not appreciably affect progesterone-induced maturation (Fig. 3B and data not shown). There is conflicting evidence on whether PI3-K is important for progesterone-induced maturation. As mentioned above, PI3-K is activated in response to both progesterone and insulin (33Muslin A.J. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6661-6666Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,35Liu X.J. Sorisky A. Zhu L. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3563-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Deuter-Reinhard M. Apell G. Pot D. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Kavanaugh W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2559-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, a putative dominant negative form of PI3-K inhibits progesterone-induced oocyte maturation (33Muslin A.J. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6661-6666Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that PI3-K is an important mediator of progesterone-induced maturation. However, the phosphatase SIP/SHIP inhibits the induction of oocyte maturation by PI3-K overexpression and by insulin but does not inhibit progesterone-induced maturation, arguing against an important role for PI3-K in progesterone-induced maturation (36Deuter-Reinhard M. Apell G. Pot D. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Kavanaugh W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2559-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, the PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin has been reported to block insulin-induced maturation but not progesterone-induced maturation (35Liu X.J. Sorisky A. Zhu L. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3563-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These findings argue that PI3-K is at most a redundant, inessential mediator of progesterone-induced maturation. In light of the association of XPR with PI3-K activity, we reassessed the role of PI3-K in progesterone-stimulated oocyte maturation. We used relatively low (more physiological) concentrations of progesterone (0.6 μm) to increase the likelihood that any redundant progesterone-induced pathways would not overwhelm any contribution made by the PI3-K pathway and used various concentrations of the irreversible PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin. As shown in Fig.4A, as little as 10 nm wortmannin was effective in inhibiting the co-precipitation of active PI3-K with XPR. Wortmannin also caused a significant delay in progesterone-induced maturation as assessed by GVBD. The extent of the delay depended on the dosage of wortmannin used (Fig. 4B). Low doses (10 nm) of wortmannin delayed maturation by about 2 h, whereas high doses (1 μm) blocked maturation. In contrast to the relatively modest effects of wortmannin on progesterone-stimulated maturation, insulin-induced maturation was already completely blocked by the lowest dose of wortmannin used (10 nm) (Fig. 4C). Similar results were also obtained with the inhibitor LY29400, which caused a delay in progesterone-induced oocyte maturation and complete inhibition of insulin-stimulated oocyte maturation (data not shown). Thus PI3-K activity may contribute to progesterone-induced oocyte maturation, but it is more important for insulin-induced maturation. The phosphorylation of human PR-B at serine 294 by p42 MAPK signals its degradation by the 26 S proteasome in human breast cancer cells (37Lange C.A. Shen T. Horwitz K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1032-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In Xenopus oocytes, p42 MAPK (ERK2) becomes quantitatively activated just prior to GVBD and remains active in mature oocytes and eggs. p42 MAPK activation promotes Cdc2 activation, suppresses DNA replication between meiosis I and meiosis II, and helps establish the metaphase arrest of matureXenopus oocytes and eggs (10Ferrell Jr., J.E. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 38Abrieu A. Doree M. Fisher D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 257-267PubMed Google Scholar, 39Nebreda A.R. Ferby I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 666-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether p42 MAPK might associate with and phosphorylate XPR in oocytes. No p42 MAPK was detected in XPR immunoprecipitates from G2phase oocytes, which possess inactive p42 MAPK, or from oocytes treated with progesterone for 120 min, which possess active p42 MAPK but have not yet undergone GVBD (Fig.5B). However, p42 MAPK was detected in XPR immunoprecipitates from GVBD-stage oocytes (Fig.5B). The XPR-associated p42 MAPK was detectable with p42 MAPK antibodies and with antibodies to active phospho-MAPK (Fig.5B). Only trace levels of p42 MAPK were detectable in control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5B). Thus, XPR associates with p42 MAPK, but only after GVBD. Since active p42 MAPK was associated with XPR after GVBD, we examined whether p42 MAPK can phosphorylate XPR in vitro. We incubated control and XPR immunoprecipitates with active p42 MAPK in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig.5C, active p42 MAPK brought about the phosphorylation of a 110-kDa protein in the XPR immunoprecipitates but not in the control immunoprecipitates. The phosphoprotein band co-migrated with p110 XPR. There was no detectable phosphorylation of the p82 XPR protein (Fig. 5C). The recent reports that overexpression of XPR accelerates progesterone-induced maturation (24Bayaa M. Booth R.A. Sheng Y. Liu X.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12607-12612Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and antisense XPR oligonucleotides inhibit progesterone-induced maturation (25Tian J. Kim S. Heilig E. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14358-14363Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) support the idea that a classical progesterone receptor mediates progesterone-induced oocyte maturation, a physiological process long thought to be mediated by some other type of receptor. Here we have examined three questions that emerge out of these studies: (i) Can the localization of XPR account for the ability of bead-linked steroids to induce maturation? (ii) Is XPR able to directly engage signal transduction pathways that are involved in maturation? (iii) Can the steroid specificity of XPR-mediated signaling responses account for the steroid specificity of maturation? Bayaa et al. (24Bayaa M. Booth R.A. Sheng Y. Liu X.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12607-12612Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) found no evidence for association of XPR with the plasma membrane. They proposed instead that the evidence that the maturation-inducing receptor was located in the plasma membrane needed to be reexamined. They pointed out that the induction of maturation by bead-linked steroids could result from the leaching of steroids off the beads and into the cytoplasm. They also noted that not all laboratories agree that microinjected progesterone is ineffective at inducing maturation (24Bayaa M. Booth R.A. Sheng Y. Liu X.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12607-12612Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Even so, it would be difficult to reconcile the observation that washed plasma membranes respond to progesterone with the hypothesis that the progesterone receptor is exclusively cytoplasmic. The present studies provide a resolution to this problem. We found that about 5% of the oocytes' p82 XPR is present in washed membranes. This amount of membrane-associated p82 XPR cannot be accounted for by cytoplasmic or nuclear contamination. Thus, p82 XPR could be responsible for the maturation-inducing effects of bead-linked steroids and the effects of progesterone on adenylyl cyclase activity in washed plasma membrane preparations (15Masui Y.

Nature. 1981; 292: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We found two links between XPR and the biochemistry of oocyte maturation. First, we found that progesterone causes XPR to become associated with PI3-K activity. No significant amount of PI3-K activity was found in control immunoprecipitates, indicating that the association is specific to XPR, and no XPR-associated PI3-K activity was found in oocytes induced to mature with RU486, hydrocortisone, or deoxycorticosterone, indicating that the association depends upon the interaction of XPR with a progestin agonist. In agreement with previous studies (35Liu X.J. Sorisky A. Zhu L. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3563-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we found that PI3-K activation plays an important role in insulin-induced maturation. In addition, PI3-K may facilitate progesterone-induced maturation. Oocytes treated with low concentrations of wortmannin (10 nm) exhibited an ∼2-h delay in progesterone-induced maturation when submaximal concentrations of progesterone (0.6 μm) were used. Consistent with these findings, Andersen et al. 2C. B. Andersen, H. Sakaue, M. Wu, R. A. Roth, and M. Conti, manuscript in preparation. have recently shown that inhibition of Akt, an important downstream mediator of PI3-K activity, blocks insulin-induced maturation and delays progesterone-induced maturation, but only when submaximal concentrations of progesterone are used. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that PI3-K and Akt are essential mediators of insulin-induced maturation and contributors to progesterone-induced maturation. However, we found that increasing concentrations of wortmannin (>10 nm) cause increasing degrees of inhibition of maturation, although PI3-K is maximally inhibited by 10 nm wortmannin. This finding raises the possibility that the effects of wortmannin on progesterone-induced maturation are unrelated to inhibition of PI3-K. We also found that XPR interacts with p42 MAPK. This interaction was only detectable after GVBD, suggesting that the activation of p42 MAPK (which occurs prior to GVBD) does not depend upon this association and is not sufficient to bring about this association. In many cell types, active p42 MAPK concentrates in the nucleus. Since XPR is cytoplasmic, perhaps active p42 MAPK is sequestered away from XPR until GVBD occurs. p42 MAPK was able to phosphorylate p110 XPR in XPR immunoprecipitates, raising the possibility that p42 MAPK triggers the degradation of p110 XPR, as has been seen in breast cancer cells (37Lange C.A. Shen T. Horwitz K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1032-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, although some experiments showed an apparent decrease in p110 XPR abundance in progesterone-treated oocytes (see, for example, Fig. 5A), this was not a consistent finding (cf. Fig. 1, Aand B). Finally, we examined whether the steroid specificity of XPR-linked signaling can account for the ability of oocytes to mature in response to RU486, hydrocortisone, and deoxycorticosterone (as well as progesterone). We found no association of XPR with active PI3-K in oocytes that had been induced to mature with RU486, hydrocortisone, or deoxycorticosterone. Thus, some receptor other than XPR is probably responsible for the maturation-inducing effects of these hormones. One attractive hypothesis is that other classical steroid hormone receptors, such as the glucocorticoid receptor, mediate these effects, although the potent glucocorticoid dexamethasone, which would be expected to interact with a classical glucocorticoid receptor, fails to induce maturation (29Baulieu E.E. Godeau F. Schorderet M. Schorderet-Slatkine S. Nature. 1978; 275: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Recently, Morrison et al.(40Morrison T. Waggoner L. Whitworth-Langley L. Stith B.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2145-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have shown that progesterone can bring about the activation of a tyrosine-specific protein kinase in oocyte membrane/cortex preparations. It will be of interest to see whether this tyrosine kinase is also stimulated by RU486, hydrocortisone, and deoxycorticosterone. In summary, our studies provide new evidence for the involvement of a classical progesterone receptor in meiotic maturation. The identity of the receptor responsible for maturation is becoming less elusive, although perhaps not yet conclusive. We thank C. Dreyer for the generous gift of the anti-N1/N2 antibodies.

We analyzed the contribution of the four DBDs to ssDNA binding affinity by assaying recombinant yeast RPA in which a single DBD (A, B, C, or D) was inactive. Inactivation was accomplished by mutating the two conserved aromatic stacking residues present in each DBD. Mutation of domain A had the most severe effect and eliminated binding to a short substrate such as (dT)12. RPA containing mutations in DBDs B and C bound to substrates (dT)12, 17, and 23 but with reduced affinity compared with wild type RPA. Mutation of DBD-D had little or no effect on the binding of RPA to these substrates. However, mutations in domain D did affect the binding to oligonucleotides larger than 23 nucleotides (nt). Protein-DNA cross-linking indicated that DBD-A (in RPA1) is essential for RPA1 to interact efficiently with substrates of 12 nt or less and that DBD-D (RPA2) interacts efficiently with oligonucleotides of 27 nt or larger. The data support a sequential model of binding in which DBD-A is responsible for the initial interaction with ssDNA, that domains A, B, and C (RPA1) contact 12–23 nt of ssDNA, and that DBD-D (RPA2) is needed for RPA to interact with substrates that are 23–27 nt in length.

Human RPA (hsRPA) is a multimeric complex of three subunits, 70 kDa (RPA1), 34 kDa (RPA2), and 11 kDa (RPA3), that binds to ssDNA with high affinity and binds poorly to double-stranded DNA and RNA (2Wold M.S.

RPA has been identified in numerous species including the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae (scRPA), where it is a heterotrimeric complex of 69-, 36-, and 13-kDa subunits (5Heyer W.D. Rao M.R.

Nature. 1989; 342: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The genes encoding scRPA1–3 are referred to as RFA1–3, respectively, and each gene is essential for viability (5Heyer W.D.

The binding of RPA to ssDNA has been analyzed by a number of methods, and a consensus has emerged on the size of ssDNA occluded by a bound trimer. Cross-linking of hsRPA to ssDNA revealed an initially unstable 8-nt binding mode that resolves to a stable mode in which 30 nt are occluded (10Blackwell L.J. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell.

A high affinity 30-nt binding mode was also obtained for hsRPA and scRPA using fluorescence quenching and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (12Kim C. Snyder R.O. Wold M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3050-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 13Kim C. Paulus B.F. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14197-14206Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The binding site size for a number of other species of RPA has been reported, including Drosophila melanogaster (22 nt) (14Mitsis P.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Lehman I.R.

However, a 90-nt binding mode has been reported for scRPA using fluorescence quenching and electron microscopy (17Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The RPA1 subunit displays strong ssDNA binding on its own (6Brill S.J. Stillman B.

Chem. 1989; 264: 2801-2809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the central domain of hsRPA1 has been determined and shown to consist of two structurally similar ssDNA binding domains (DBDs), or OB-folds (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding folds) (19Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA binding by these domains (A and B) is accomplished by aromatic amino acid residues stacking with the individual bases of ssDNA and by hydrogen bonds between the protein and both the phosphate backbone and DNA bases. DBD-A and -B contact 3 nt each, with 2 nt between the two domains. The C-terminal domain of RPA1 (DBD-C) is a third ssDNA binding domain that requires zinc and is likely to contain another OB-fold (20Brill S.J. Bastin-Shanower S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7225-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Bochkareva E. Korolev S. Bochkarev A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27332-27338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RPA2 contains a fourth binding domain (DBD-D) with an OB-fold structure (22Philipova D. Mullen J.R. Maniar H.S. Lu J. Gu C. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2222-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Mass G. Nethanel T. Kaufmann G. Mol. Cell.

These four DBDs display amino acid sequence similarity particularly with respect to the aromatic residues known to stack with the ssDNA bases (20Brill S.J. Bastin-Shanower S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7225-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Structure/function analysis revealed that the N-terminal 18 kDa of RPA1 (RPA1N) is unlikely to play a role in ssDNA binding, as it is dispensable for SV40 DNA replication and has no significant binding activity (20Brill S.J. Bastin-Shanower S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7225-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Gomes X.V. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10558-10568Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, there is currently no evidence that RPA3 binds ssDNA. Our understanding of how these four DBDs contribute to the mechanism of ssDNA binding is incomplete. RPA1 is thought to account for most if not all of the heterotrimer's binding affinity (25Gomes X.V. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10558-10568Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Gomes X.V. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4534-4543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), as the interaction of ssDNA with RPA2 is weak (22Philipova D. Mullen J.R. Maniar H.S. Lu J. Gu C. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2222-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Mass G. Nethanel T. Kaufmann G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6399-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the ssDNA binding by the RPA2/3 sub-complex is difficult to detect (27Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the binding affinity of the RPA2/3 sub-complex is stimulated 100-fold when the N and C termini of RPA2 are truncated to produce a “core” domain bound to RPA3 (24Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Bochkarev A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3932-3936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A direct comparison of binding by the isolated DBDs is difficult due to their insolubility (20Brill S.J. Bastin-Shanower S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7225-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Philipova D. Mullen J.R. Maniar H.S. Lu J. Gu C. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2222-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and a systematic analysis of the role of the individual DBDs within the context of the heterotrimer is lacking. Models of ssDNA binding by the heterotrimer can be formulated based on the evidence that the DBD-A/B dimer interacts with 8 nt of ssDNA. The simplest model to account for most of the data is that the four DBDs collectively interact with 18–20 nt and, together with flanking domains, occlude a total of 30 nt of ssDNA (28Bochkareva E. Belegu V. Korolev S. Bochkarev A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To systematically analyze the role of the four DBDs, we asked how each domain contributes to the overall binding affinity of RPA. To accomplish this, we inactivated a single DBD within the context of the RPA heterotrimer and compared its binding affinity to that of wild type (wt) RPA. Thus, RPA containing an inactive domain A, B, C, or D was purified and bound to substrates of various size. Using a short substrate, such as (dT)12, no stable interaction could be detected with RPA containing inactive domain A (RPA-A−), whereas theKa for RPA-B− or RPA-C−was ∼1/3 that of wild type RPA. The Ka of RPA-D− was unaffected for substrates 12–23 nt in length but was 1/3 to 1/2 that of wild type RPA for substrates of 40 nt or longer. These data suggest that domains A, B, and C interact with 12 nt and that DBD-D interacts with ssDNA greater that 23 nt. This conclusion was confirmed by in vitro cross-linking of substrate DNA to RPA. The plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. To express recombinant RPA using the T7 RNA polymerase system (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar), we constructed triple expression plasmids in which each of theRFA genes is driven by it own T7 promoter. The wt RPA triple expression plasmid, pSAS106, which was used as the parent vector of allRFA1 aromatic amino acid mutants, was constructed from three separate expression plasmids. The RFA1, RFA2, andRFA3 open reading frames were ligated into pET11a (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar) onNdeI/BamHI cassettes to create pRF6, pJM223, and pJM329, respectively. The RFA1 open reading frame in pRF6 was amplified from pJM136 (22Philipova D. Mullen J.R. Maniar H.S. Lu J. Gu C. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2222-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which lacks internal NdeI sites. In addition, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with Vent DNA polymerase was used to introduce unique XhoI andAsp718 sites at codons corresponding to the junctions of the single-stranded DNA binding domains A/B and B/C, respectively (see Fig.1). This resulted in the amino acid replacements S293L, N294E, and I424G, which were found to have no effect on ssDNA binding activity (data not shown). A unique SacII site was also engineered after the stop codon of RFA1 just upstream of the uniqueBamHI of pRF6. The double expression plasmid pJM332 was created by ligating the BglII-BamHI fragment of pJM223 (containing T7-RFA2) into the BamHI site of pJM329 (containing T7-RFA3). TheBglII-BamHI fragment of pJM332 was then ligated into the BamHI site of pRF6 to create the triple expression plasmid pSAS106. DNA sequencing revealed that only the intended changes were present in the final construction.Table IPlasmids used in this studyNameInsertRelevant amino acid changesVectorReference or sourcepRF6RFA1RPA1: S293L,N294E,I424GpET11aThis studypJM223RFA2NonepET11a7Brill S.J.

This plasmid, pSAS204, was subsequently digested with BglII and BamHI, and the released fragment was ligated into the BglII site of pJM128 to create the triple expression plasmid pSAS103. All constructs were sequenced to show that only the intended changes were made. Recombinant RPA proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) essentially as described (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm was 0.5. The cultures were induced for 2 h by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.4 mm. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer B (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing 100 mm NaCl. All subsequent steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Samples were subjected to 3 freeze-thaw cycles and 8 sonication periods of 15 s each. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was applied to a 50-ml Affi-Gel blue affinity resin (Bio-Rad). The column was washed sequentially with 3 column volumes of buffer B containing 800 mm NaCl and buffer B containing 0.5 m NaSCN. The protein was then eluted with buffer B containing 1.5 mNaSCN. Peak fractions identified by the Bradford analysis were pooled, loaded onto a 5-ml hydroxylapatite column (Bio-Rad) and washed sequentially with 15 ml of buffer B containing either 40 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.5), 120 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.5), or 500 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.5). The protein eluted in the 120 mm NaH2PO4 wash. Peak fractions containing RPA were identified by SDS, 17% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), pooled, and dialyzed in buffer A (same as buffer B above, except that 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was substituted for HEPES) containing 100 mm NaCl. The dialyzed fractions were loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) washed with 3 ml of buffer A containing 100 mmNaCl and eluted in a 10-ml linear gradient from 100 to 400 mm NaCl. Peak RPA fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and diluted with buffer A until the conductance was equivalent to buffer A plus 25 mm NaCl. The diluted sample was applied to a 2-ml phosphocellulose column (Whatman) and washed with 5 ml of buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl or 1 m NaCl. The protein was eluted in the 500 mm NaCl wash. Samples from the fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and those containing highly purified RPA were pooled and dialyzed in buffer B containing 25 mm NaCl or buffer B containing no EDTA, 20 μmZnSO4, and 25 mm NaCl. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The standard DNA binding reaction was performed in a total volume of 15 μl and contained the indicated purified protein samples from E. coli, 2 fmols of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide ((dT)12, (dT)17, (dT)23, (dT)40, or (dT)60), 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 20 μmZnSO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. RPA titrations ranged from 0.58 pm to 35 nm. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C, and the products were resolved on native 6% polyacrylamide gels (37.5:1 acrylamide:bis) containing 0.5× Tris-borate EDTA. The band intensities of free and bound DNA were analyzed with a PhosphorImager and IP-Lab Gel software. The proportions of the free and bound oligo were calculated, and a reciprocal plot of the Langmuir isotherm was used to determine the dissociation constant (Kd) for each protein and oligonucleotide. Dissociation constants were then converted to their corresponding association constants (Ka). Binding reactions used for the denaturing immunoprecipitation assay were carried out under identical conditions except for the following. Equimolar amounts of purified protein and 32P-labeled oligonucleotide were incubated together in the absence of glycerol and Nonidet P-40 and in the presence of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reactions were UV-cross-linked using a Stratalinker (Stratagene) at a dose of 1000 J/m2. Samples were then boiled for 10 min in denaturing buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and radioimmune precipitation assay buffer lacking SDS (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate (DOC)) was added to dilute the SDS concentration to 0.2%. Anti-RPA1 or anti-RPA2 antibody was then added, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were incubated with protein A beads at 4 °C for 1 h while mixing and then centrifuged to pellet the antibody-RPA-DNA complex. SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min, resolved by SDS-15% PAGE, and visualized by phosphorimaging. To determine the contribution of the four DBDs of yeast RPA to ssDNA binding, we sought to assay RPA proteins in which a single DBD had been inactivated. The inactivation of these DBDs was accomplished by mutating residues critical for ssDNA binding. The crystal structure of hsRPA domains A and B bound to ssDNA identified a number of residues that make specific hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with ssDNA (19Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). We focused on the two aromatic residues that make hydrophobic stacking interactions with the ssDNA bases for the following reasons. Hydrogen bonding between RPA and the DNA bases is dependent on the sequence of the substrate DNA (19Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), and the amino acid residues involved in these interactions are not conserved in all four DBDs. In contrast, the hydrophobic stacking interactions appear to be independent of DNA sequence, and the positions of the aromatic residues are conserved in all four DBDs (20Brill S.J. Bastin-Shanower S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7225-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, mutation of the two aromatic residues would be expected to have the same effect in each DBD, allowing us to compare the relative roles of the four DBDs in ssDNA binding. Effects due to DNA sequence heterogeneity were eliminated by the use of homopolymeric oligo(dT) as substrate. To assay mutant RPA proteins we designed an expression plasmid in which a variety of mutations could be introduced into a single RPA subunit and co-expressed with the remaining two subunits. Expression in bacteria was essential, as two of the single amino acid replacements (F238A and F537A) were previously shown to be lethal in yeast (20Brill S.J. Bastin-Shanower S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7225-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The schematic diagram presented in Fig. 1illustrates that wt RPA was expressed from a plasmid in which each DBD of RPA1 is encoded by a unique cassette. In addition, each of the three genes is driven by its own T7 promoter (not shown). Amino acid sequence alignment was previously used to identify the aromatic amino acids in each DBD that are homologous to the stacking residues identified in the crystal structure of hsRPA domains A and B (19Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 20Brill S.J. Bastin-Shanower S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7225-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To express RPA with an inactive DBD these residues were mutated to alanine in pairs (Fig. 1). After expression in E. coli, RPA was purified using affinity and ion exchange chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified proteins indicated a purity of at least 95% (Fig.2). Mutation of domain A appeared to cause a significant structural change in the protein as the bands corresponding to the RPA1 subunit in the A− and A−B− mutants migrated somewhat slower than those of wt or other RPA mutants. This behavior may be related to the significance of this domain in mediating ssDNA binding (see below). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to determine the ssDNA binding affinity of wt and mutant RPA. This assay is a sensitive method for the analysis of RPA-DNA interactions that uses nanomolar concentrations of RPA so that equilibrium binding conditions are achieved (12Kim C. Snyder R.O. Wold M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3050-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 13Kim C. Paulus B.F. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14197-14206Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Before performing these assays, we determined the percentage of purified RPA in our preparations that was able to bind ssDNA. A constant amount of RPA was incubated with increasing amounts of radiolabeled (dT)30, and the DNA-protein complexes were separated on a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. The radioactive signals from the free and bound DNA were visualized by phosphorimaging (Fig.3A). Only singly liganded complexes were observed using this substrate. At low levels of input, DNA binding was quantitative, and no free DNA was visible. As the amount of input DNA increased, the signal for the bound complex became more intense until it remained constant. After quantitation of these signals, the fraction of bound RPA was determined and plottedversus moles of substrate DNA. At saturation, ∼24% of the RPA heterotrimer was bound to oligo(dT)30 (Fig. 3B). This fraction of RPA is referred to as the “active” fraction, and analysis of RPA mutants revealed similar levels of activity (data not shown). Therefore, an average value of 24% active protein was used in calculating the binding constants of RPA proteins analyzed in this study. A series of electrophoretic mobility shift assays using various lengths of oligo(dT) was performed using wt and mutant RPA. We incubated increasing amounts of each RPA protein with a fixed amount of32P-labeled oligonucleotide and resolved the bound complex from the free DNA using nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. The amounts of free and bound DNA were then analyzed using phosphorimaging. Fig.4 shows binding assays for wt RPA as well as the C−, D−, and A−B− mutants using (dT)17 and (dT)40 as substrates. Similar experiments were performed with the A−and B− mutants. In the case of (dT)17, titration with RPA resulted in a single complex migrating slower than free probe (Fig.4A). At high concentrations of wt RPA and the D− mutant, all of the ssDNA became bound by protein. In contrast, the A−B− mutant yielded no DNA-protein complex, even at high protein concentrations, and the C− mutant bound ssDNA only at the highest protein concentrations. Based on this qualitative assay, we conclude that wt RPA binds (dT)17 as a singly liganded form and that saturated binding requires a molar excess of RPA over substrate. Furthermore, mutating the stacking residues appears to be an effective method of inactivating the DBDs. Mutation of DBD-C compromises binding of the (dT)17 substrate, whereas the A−B− mutation eliminates binding of (dT)17. Interestingly, the D− mutant appears to bind this substrate as well as wt RPA. In the case of (dT)40, titration with wt RPA revealed a retarded band that was saturated at equimolar levels of RPA (Fig. 4B). At the highest wt RPA concentrations, a second more slowly migrating form appeared. We interpret this to be a multiply liganded complex as previously observed (13Kim C. Paulus B.F. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14197-14206Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A similar response was obtained with the C− and D− mutants, although the multiply liganded complex occurs with somewhat lower levels of RPA-D− than with wt RPA. In contrast, we observed only a singly liganded complex with the A−B− mutant, which only appeared at high protein concentrations (Fig.4B). We conclude that under these conditions (dT)40 is sufficiently large to accommodate two RPA complexes. Furthermore, although the A−B− mutant is unable to bind a substrate of 17 nt, it retains the ability to bind a substrate of 40 nt. This suggests that RPA contains DBDs in addition to A and B that only function with longer oligonucleotides. The binding affinity of wt and mutant RPA was determined by calculating equilibrium binding constants for substrates of various lengths. The intensity of the signal corresponding to the free and bound DNA was quantitated and fitted to the Langmuir equation. The values of the binding constants determined from these and other titrations are presented in Table II, whereas Fig.5 summarizes the findings. For all proteins there was an increased binding affinity for (dT)60 compared with (dT)12 (Table II and Fig. 5). For example, the binding constants (Ka) for wt RPA ranged from 1.8 × 108 m−1 for (dT)12 to 2.3 × 1010 m−1 for (dT)60. This effect was previously repor"

Peak-Chew S.Y. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7229-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Seven of these subunits are encoded in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)1 (2Chomyn A.

Riley M. Doolittle R.F. Attardi G. Science. 1986; 234: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). These subunits have attracted considerable interest because of the diseases that have been associated with mutations in one or the other of their coding genes, in particular the various forms of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) (4Brown M.D. Wallace D.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast to the multisubunit enzyme of mammalian cells, which contains a proton translocating site and is rotenone-sensitive, the internal NADH-Q oxidoreductase ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, NDI1, is a simple subunit of 513 amino acid residues, including the NH2-terminal 26-residue signal sequence for import into mitochondria, which is not proton-translocating and is rotenone-insensitive (5de Vries S. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 6de Vries S. Van Witzenburg R. Grivell L.A. Marres C.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The finding that the NDI1 enzyme, expressed in Escherichia coli, acts as a member of the bacterial respiratory chain (7Kitajima-Ihara T. Yagi T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and the observation that complex I-type enzymes and NDI1-type enzymes co-exist in bacteria and plant and fungal mitochondria (8Yagi T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1991; 23: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 9Yagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) have suggested the possibility that the NDI1 gene, introduced into the nuclear genome of mammalian cells, could be expressed, imported into mitochondria, and integrated into the host cell respiratory chain. If the host cells are complex I-deficient because of a nuclear or mtDNA mutation, functional expression of the NDI1 could be useful to correct the complex I defect. That this is indeed the case for a complex I deficiency associated with a nuclear gene mutation has recently been demonstrated by experiments showing that the S. cerevisiae NDI1 gene, transfected into Chinese hamster cells carrying a deletion in the gene for the essential nuclear-encoded MWFE subunit, can restore the respiratory NADH dehydrogenase activity in the host cells (10Seo B.B. Kitajima-Ihara T. Chan E.K. Scheffler I.E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Proc. Natl. acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9167-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These experiments have clearly pointed to the potential value of transfection of the NDI1 gene for the therapy of mitochondrial diseases. Subsequent observations that theNDI1 gene can be functionally expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (11Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and in non-proliferating human cells (12Seo B.B. Wang J. Flotte T.R. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37774-37780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have supported the above conclusion. Because most human mitochondrial diseases associated with defective complex I activity, which have been reported so far, are due to mutations in the mitochondrial genome (13Wallace D.C. Brown M.D. Lott M.T. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 211-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), it was important to analyze the function of the yeast NDI1 gene and its encoded protein in human cells carrying mutations in mtDNA-encoded complex I subunits. The availability of C4T, a human cell line, isolated in the laboratory, with a homoplasmic frameshift mutation in the mitochondrialND4 gene (14Hofhaus G. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3043-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), provided a unique opportunity to investigate this problem. It has, in fact, been shown that, in C4T cells, there is no assembly of the mtDNA-encoded subunits of NADH dehydrogenase and a complete loss of its respiratory function and enzyme activity. The investigation of the behavior of the NDI1 enzyme introduced into C4T cells seemed the more necessary, as it was conceivable that the continued synthesis and accumulation of the non-mutated mtDNA-encoded subunits of complex I in this cell line (14Hofhaus G. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3043-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) could interfere with the correct integration of the yeast gene in the human respiratory chain, especially in view of the proposed role of ND1 in ubiquinone binding (1Sazanov L.A. Peak-Chew S.Y. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7229-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the present work, the NDI1 gene has been introduced into C4T cells, leading to the isolation of two transformant cell lines with low or high levels of expression of the exogenous gene. These two cell lines exhibited, respectively, near-complete and full restoration of NADH-dependent respiration. This was in both cases insensitive to rotenone and fully inhibitable by antimycin A, the latter finding indicating a coupling of the NDI1 to the downstream portion of the respiratory chain. Furthermore, measurements of P:O ratios revealed that, in transformed cells, this enzyme can modulate oxidative phosphorylation in the host cells. All the human cell lines used in the present work were grown in monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FBS). The construction of the NDI1-expressing plasmid pHook(NDI1) has been described previously (10Seo B.B. Kitajima-Ihara T. Chan E.K. Scheffler I.E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Proc. Natl. acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9167-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The rAAV-NDI1, a recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying the NDI1 gene, was prepared by Dr. Terence R. Flotte (University of Florida, Gainesville) as reported earlier (12Seo B.B. Wang J. Flotte T.R. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37774-37780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The human cell line C4T, carrying in homoplasmic form a frameshift mutation in theND4 gene had also been previously isolated by cytoplast x cell fusion-mediated transfer of mitochondria from a rotenone-resistant mutant (C4) of the VA2B cell line into human mtDNA-less 143B.TK− ρ°206 cells (14Hofhaus G. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3043-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the present work, C4T cells were transfected with pHook (NDI1) by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method (15Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and several transfectant cells lines, among them C4T-Ca, were isolated by screening in DMEM with 10% FBS and 0.6 mg/ml G418 (gentamycin). In another experiment, C4T cells were infected with 9 × 108 infectious units of rAAV-NDI1 virions, and several transduced clones, among them C4T-AAV, were isolated by screening in DMEM with 10% FBS and 0.1 µm rotenone. The clones C4T-Ca and C4T-AAV, with a low and, respectively, a high level of expression of NDI1, were selected for a detailed analysis. To analyze mitochondrial protein synthesis, pulse-labeling experiments with [35S]methionine were performed according to Chomyn (16Chomyn A. Attardi G. Chomyn A. Methods in Enzymology Mitochondrial Biogenesis and Genetics, Part B. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 197-211Google Scholar). Samples of 2 × 106 cells of the desired type were plated on 10-cm Petri dishes, incubated overnight, washed with methionine-free DMEM, and then incubated for 7 min at 37 °C in 4 ml of the same medium containing 100 µg/ml of the cytosolic translational inhibitor emetine. Thereafter, [35S]methionine (0.2 mCi (1175 Ci/mmol)) was added, and the cells were incubated for 30 min. The labeled cells were trypsinized, washed, and lysed in 1% SDS. Samples containing 30–50 µg of protein were electrophoresed through a 15–20% exponential SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel (16Chomyn A. Attardi G. Chomyn A. Methods in Enzymology Mitochondrial Biogenesis and Genetics, Part B. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 197-211Google Scholar). The presence and amount of NDI1gene(s) in the C4T-Ca and C4T-AAV cells were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after PCR amplification from total cell DNA. The PCR reactions were carried out by using primers NDI1-For, AGCACAGCGACAAACCAAAC and NDI1-Rev, TCAGGTTGGTATAGCTGGCT. Another set of primers was used for PCR amplification of the mitochondrialND4 gene: ND4-For, TGCCCAAGAACTATCAAACTCC (positions 11,305–11,326 in the Cambridge sequence, Ref. 17Anderson S. Bankier A.T.

Shakeley R.M. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), except that denaturation was carried out at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The ND4–4For and ND4–4Rev primers were added to the reaction mixture at the end of 6 cycles, and then another 21 cycles were carried out. Total cell RNA was isolated by the RNAzol B procedure (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). RNA extracted from 5 × 106 cells was treated with 30 units of RNase-free DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C overnight. After phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the reverse transcription reactions were carried out as previously described (18Bai Y. Shakeley R.M. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Subsequently, PCR amplification was performed using the same conditions as for DNA analysis, and the products were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cells were grown on glass coverslips, for the last 1.5 h in the presence of 500 nm MitoTracker Green (Molecular Probes) in serum-free medium. The coverslips were washed in PBS (140 mm NaCl, 3.8 mm NaH2PO4, 16.2 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4) and fixed in a mixture of methanol and acetone (3:1) for 2 min at −20 °C. The coverslips were then incubated with rabbit anti-NdI1 antiserum, diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 2% horse serum for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. After three washes in the same buffer, the coverslips were incubated with 1:100-diluted rhodamine red-X-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, the coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides in FluoroGuard Antifade Reagent (Bio-Rad), and analyzed on a Zeiss 310 laser-scanning microscope equipped with a 488 nm argon and a 543 nm helium neon lasers, using constant laser parameters. The medium of the cell lines to be analyzed was replaced with fresh medium the day before the measurements. Determination of the O2 consumption rate in intact cells was carried out on 3.7–6.7 × 106cells in Tris-based, Mg2+,Ca2+-deficient (TD) buffer (0.137 m NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4 at 25 °C), as previously described (19Villani G.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 476-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), about 3.9 to 6.1 × 106 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.1, 10 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose), and then 100 µg of digitonin (1 µl of a 10% solution in dimethyl sulfoxide) in 1 ml of buffer were added. After incubation for 1 min at room temperature, the cell suspension was diluted with 8 ml of buffer. The cells were rapidly pelleted and resuspended in respiration buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.1, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm KPi, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1.0 mm ADP). The measurements were carried out in two chambers of an YSI Model 5300 Biological Oxygen Monitor. The substrates (adjusted to ∼pH 7.0 with NaOH) and inhibitors were added with Hamilton syringes. The final concentrations were as follows: malate, 5 mm; glutamate, 5 mm; succinate, 5 mm; glycerol-3-phosphate, 5 mm; ascorbate, 10 mm;N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD), 0.2 mm; NADH, 0.5 mm; rotenone, 100 nm; flavone, 0.5 mm; antimycin A, 20 nm; and KCN, 1 mm. These were carried out, by a novelin situ method in digitonin-permeabilized cells (21Villani G. Attardi G. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 119-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using a Hansatech oxygraph with an adjustable chamber volume. The measurements were made on 3–7 × 106 cells, permeabilized with 0.005% digitonin in an assay buffer consisting of 75 mm sucrose, 5 mmKH2PO4, 40 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 mmP1,P5-di(adenosine-5′) pentaphosphate (AP5A) (Sigma), 0.32% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Malate (5 mm) and glutamate (5 mm), or, after addition of rotenone (100 nm), succinate (5 mm) were used as respiratory substrates. 37.5–50 nmols of ADP were added, depending on the volume of the cell suspension in the chamber (0.5–1.0 ml) and on the substrate for each P:O measurement. Multiple identical samples of 105 cells were grown for 7 days on 10-cm Petri dishes in the appropriate medium (DMEM, which contains 4.5 mg of glucose/ml and 0.11 mg of pyruvate/ml, or DMEM lacking glucose and containing 0.9 mg of galactose/ml and 0.5 mg of pyruvate/ml, Ref. 22Hayashi J.I.

C4T is a human cell line with a homoplasmic frameshift mutation in the mitochondrial ND4 gene, in which there is no assembly of mtDNA-encoded subunits of NADH dehydrogenase and complete loss of its respiratory function and enzyme activity (14Hofhaus G. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3043-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). C4T cells were either transfected with the plasmid pHook (NDI1) by calcium-phosphate precipitation or infected with rAAV-NDI1 virions, and two transformants, C4T-Ca and C4T-AAV, respectively, were isolated. The success of the transformation was shown by PCR amplification of aNDI1 gene fragment (Fig.1a). The results also showed that C4T-AAV had a higher NDI1 gene copy number (estimated to be ∼10-fold) than C4T-Ca, as a result of the higher transducing efficiency of the recombinant adeno-associated virus vector as the delivering system (12Seo B.B. Wang J. Flotte T.R. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37774-37780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The RNA expression levels of theNDI1 gene were measured by reverse transcription-PCR, and the results (Fig. 1b) showed a higher NDI1 mRNA level in C4T-AAV than in C4T-Ca cells, presumably because of the higherNDI1 gene copy number. C4T-Ca and C4T-AAV cells were also analyzed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy by using anti-NDI1 antiserum and the mitochondrial-specific fluorescent probe MitoTracker. As shown in Fig.2, the NDI1 protein was predominantly localized in mitochondria in both transformants. C4T-AAV cells showed a higher expression level of its protein product. To exclude the possibility of the occurrence of revertants in the original C4T cell population (23Enriquez J.A. Cabezas-Herrera J. Bayona-Bafaluy M.P. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11207-11215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the mitochondrial translation products were labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min in the presence of emetine. As shown in Fig. 3, aand b, there were no ND4 products in either C4T-Ca or C4T-AAV cells, as in their parent C4T cells. To assess the activities of the yeast NDI1 protein in human cells and to investigate whether it can restore the complex I defects in mutant cells, the respiration properties of the wild-type 143B.TK− cells, the mutant C4T cells, and the two NDI1-transfectants, C4T-Ca and C4T-AAV, were investigated in detail. To distinguish the NADH dehydrogenase activity of the mammalian complex I from that of the yeast NDI1 enzyme, the significant difference in their sensitivity to the respiration inhibitor rotenone (5de Vries S. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was utilized. At first, experiments were carried out with intact or digitonin-permeabilized 143B.TK− cells, to investigate the action of flavone, a drug which inhibits the yeast NDI1 (5de Vries S. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), on the mammalian respiratory chain. As shown in Fig. 4, aand b, the endogenous respiration of intact cells was extensively inhibited by 100 nm rotenone and nearly completely by 0.5 mm flavone, the residual low respiration in the presence of the latter drug being insensitive to 20 nm antimycin A. These observations strongly suggested that flavone inhibits complex I or NADH-producing dehydrogenases. This conclusion was confirmed by experiments carried out on digitonin-permeabilized 143B.TK− cells. The malate/glutamate-driven respiration, which usually reflects the rate-limiting activity of complex I, was completely inhibited by rotenone (not shown) and flavone (Fig. 4c). By contrast, the succinate/glycerol-3-phosphate-driven respiration, which usually reflects the rate-limiting activity of complex III, was nearly insensitive to flavone (Fig. 4d), whereas the ascorbate/TMPD-dependent respiration, which reflects the activity of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) was completely insensitive to this drug (Fig. 4e). The endogenous respiration activities of intact C4T cells and their intact NDI1 transformants are shown in Fig.5a. C4T cells, which carry in homoplasmic form the ND4 frameshift mutation, showed severely defective endogenous respiration. The respiration was restored in both C4T-Ca and C4T-AAV cells, although to a different extent relative to that in 143B.TK− cells, in particular, to ∼35 and ∼150%, respectively (Fig. 6a). These restoration extents corresponded to the different expression levels of the NDI1 gene. The restored activities in the NDI1 transformants were insensitive to the complex I inhibitor rotenone, but sensitive to flavone (Fig. 5a), as previously shown for NDI1 in yeast (5de Vries S. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), indicating they were because of the function ofNDI1 gene. Increasing the concentration of flavone to a saturating level did not decrease the flavone-resistant respiration in C4T-AAV cells. The high copy number of NDI1 gene in these cells and its consequent overexpression, together with the poor solubility of this drug, provide an explanation for ∼30% of the endogenous respiration being insensitive to flavone in this cell line (Fig. 5a).Figure 6Quantitative behavior of endogenous and substrate-dependent respiration in 143TK−cells, C4T cells, and C4T transformants.a,averages ± S.E. of triple measurements of endogenous respiration rate in intact 143B.TK−, C4T, C4T-Ca, and C4T-AAV cells.b, averages ± S.E. of triple measurements of the rates of respiration dependent on malate/glutamate (filled bars), succinate/glycerol-3-phosphate (hatched bars), and TMPD/ascorbate (open bars) in digitonin-permeabilized 143B.TK−, C4T, C4T-Ca, and C4T-AAV cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess further the respiration activities in the transformed cells, the malate-glutamate-dependent respiration, the succinate/glycerol-3-phosphate-dependent respiration, and the TMPD/ascorbate-dependent respiration were measured. The oxygraphic tracings for malate/glutamate-dependent respiration are shown in Fig. 5b. In C4T-Ca cells, NDI1 restored ∼70% of the NADH-dependent respiration rate, relative to that in 143B.TK− cells (Fig. 6b). Interestingly, C4T-AAV cells showed a much higher NADH-dependent respiration rate than the wild-type 143B.TK− cells (Figs. 5b and 6b). NADH stimulated only slightly the respiration of digitonin-permeabilized transformants, in particular, to an extent estimated to correspond to ∼14% of the malate/glutamate-dependent respiration in C4T-Ca cells and ∼11% in C4T-AAV cells (Fig. 5c). These observations indicated that the NADH-binding site of the expressed NDI1 faces the matrix compartment, as in yeast mitochondria. The slight stimulation of respiration by NADH in these experiments may be because of the activity of the rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c reductase, which is associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane (24Bernardi P. Azzone G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7187-7192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 6summarizes the quantitative behavior of the endogenous respiration (a) and substrate-dependent respiration (b) in 143B.TK− cells, C4T cells, and the two C4T transformants. The lack of a proton-translocating site in the yeast NDI1 led to the prediction that if the enzyme introduced into C4T cells did transfer electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, the P:O ratio coupled to NADH oxidation would be lower in the C4T-Ca and C4T-AAV transformants compared with the control (143B.TK−) ratio, whereas the P:O ratio coupled to succinate oxidation would be identical in the transformants and the control. This proved indeed to be the case. As shown in Fig. 7, in 143B.TK− cells, the P:O ratios with malate/glutamate and succinate were, respectively, ∼2.1 and ∼1.35. By contrast, the P:O ratios with malate/glutamate and succinate were, respectively, 1.16–1.34 and 1.31–1.46 in the transformants. These experiments did indeed show that the respiration restored by NDI1 in defective C4T cells was coupled with ATP synthesis, confirming the results previously obtained in normal embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with theNDI1 gene (11Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells rely on both oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis to generate ATP. However, they cannot utilize galactose efficiently in the glycolytic pathway. Consequently, in medium containing galactose instead of glucose, they are forced to rely predominantly on oxidative phosphorylation as a source of ATP. As shown in Fig. 8, whereas the wild-type 143B.TK− cells could grow well in both glucose- and galactose-containing medium, the mutant C4T cells grew well in glucose medium, but failed to grow in galactose medium, with the cells becoming progressively detached from the plate after 3 days. C4T-AAV cells showed in galactose medium a totally recovered growth capacity, which was comparable with that of wild-type 143B.TK− cells. By contrast, C4T-Ca cells exhibited only a partial restoration, presumably because of the limited expression level of the NDI1 gene(s), with a considerable decrease in growth rate after the third day, but no significant cell detachment. The present work has extended in a significant way the previous observations indicating that the single polypeptide, rotenone-insensitive internal NADH-quinone oxidoreductase of S. cerevisiae (NDI1) can restore the NADH oxidoreductase activity of complex I-deficient Chinese hamster cells carrying a deletion in the gene for an essential nuclear-encoded subunit. In fact, it has been clearly shown here that the NDI1 gene, either transfected by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method to reach a low copy number, or transduced with a virus vector to reach a high copy number into human C4T cells, carrying a mitochondrial ND4 gene mutation, was expressed appropriately in the nucleus and the cytosol of the chosen host cells. The corresponding protein was, thereafter, imported correctly into mitochondria, its NADH-binding site facing the matrix compartment, as in yeast mitochondria, and restored an NADH-quinone oxidoreductase activity that was rotenoneinsensitive, flavone-sensitive, and antimycin A-sensitive. The latter result indicated that the yeast enzyme was integrated with the downstream portion of the human respiratory chain. Furthermore, as expected from the substitution of the proton-translocating complex I by a non-proton-translocating enzyme, the P:O ratios associated with NADH oxidation were lower in the transformed cells (∼1.16–1.34) compared with the value of ∼2.1 found in 143B.TK− cells, whereas the P:O ratios coupled to succinate oxidation in the transformants (1.31–1.46) were similar to the value found in 143B.TK−cells (∼1.35). This important result indicated that the respiration supported by NDI1 was appropriately coupled to ATP synthesis. The reestablishment of oxidative phosphorylation in the C4T transformants was shown by their reacquisition of the capacity to grow under conditions where their glycolytic activity was strongly limited,i.e. in medium containing galactose instead of glucose. The rate of malate/glutamate-dependent respiration, relative to the rates of succinate or TMPD/ascorbate-driven respiration, in the transformant C4T-Ca appeared to be somewhat lower than in 143B.TK− cells, whereas it was much higher in the transformant C4T-AAV. These differences, presumably, reflected the different level of expression of the NDI1 gene in the two transformants, indicating an independent regulation of NADH-quinone oxidoreductase activity. However, a comparison of the endogenous respiration rates and the malate/glutamate-dependent respiration rates in the two transformed cell lines with the corresponding rates in the parental 143B.TK− cells suggested that the NDI1 activity was rate-limiting for respiration in the two transformants, as complex I activity usually is in 143B.TK− cells (19Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 20Hofhaus G. Shakeley R.M. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 476-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results obtained in the present work have extended to complex I deficiencies associated with mtDNA mutations the complementing capacity of the yeast NDI1, providing at the same time important insights into the regulation of its integration in the human respiratory chain. The potential usefulness of the yeast NDI1 gene as a therapeutic tool for diseases involving complex I defects has, therefore, been confirmed, and its scope, amplified."

We performed mutagenesis analysis to establish structural requirements for the interaction of CD151 with the α3β1 integrin and with other tetraspanins. Using a panel of CD151/CD9 chimeras and CD151 deletion mutants we show that the minimal region, which confers stable (e.g. Triton X-100-resistant) association of the tetraspanin with α3β1, maps within the large extracellular loop (LECL) of CD151 (the amino acid sequence between residues Leu149 and Glu213). Furthermore, the substitution of 11 amino acids (residues 195–205) from this region for a corresponding sequence from CD9 LECL or point mutations of cysteines in the conserved CCG and PXXCC motifs abolish the interaction. The removal of the LECL CD151 does not affect the association of the protein with other tetraspanins (e.g. CD9, CD81, CD63, and wild-type CD151). On the other hand, the mutation of the CCG motif selectively prevents the homotypic CD151·CD151 interaction but does not influence the association of the mutagenized CD151 with other tetraspanins. These results demonstrate the differences in structural requirements for the heterotypic and homotypic tetraspanin·tetraspanin interactions. Various deletions involving the small extracellular loop and the first three transmembrane domains prevent surface expression of the CD151 mutants but do not affect the CD151·α3β1interaction. The CD151 deletion mutants are accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum and redirected to the lysosomes. The assembly of the CD151·α3β1 complex occurs early during the integrin biosynthesis and precedes the interaction of CD151 with other tetraspanins.

Tetraspanins are expressed in different combinations on all cell types analyzed, and they are able to associate with one another and with a number of other transmembrane proteins thereby forming large multiprotein clusters on the cell surface (often referred to as a “tetraspanin web”) (9Lagaudriere-Gesbert C.

It has been proposed that tetraspanins may participate in a lateral cross-talk between various types of the receptors within the “web” thereby contributing to their signaling properties (9Lagaudriere-Gesbert C. Le Naour F. Lebel-Binay S. Billard M. Lemichez E. Boquet P. Boucheix C. Conjeaud H. Rubinstein E. Cell. Immunol. 1997; 182: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 10Sugiura T. Berditchevski F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1375-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To understand how tetraspanins affect signaling processes one has to examine spatial orientation of the proteins within the tetraspanin web and establish the mechanisms that control its assembly. This issue has been addressed in a number of recent studies, which revealed that both extracellular and cytoplasmic regions could be involved in mediating interactions of tetraspanins with other transmembrane proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Hemler M.E. Mannion B.A. Berditchevski F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 67-71PubMed Google Scholar, 2Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Specifically, it has been shown that the large extracellular loop (LECL)1 is required for the association of CD9 with the heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (11Sakuma T. Higashiyama S. Hosoe S. Hayashi S. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 474-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similarly, the extracellular portions of CD19 and the α3β1 integrin were critical for the assembly of the CD19·CD81 and α3β1·CD151 complexes thereby implicating the extracellular domains of the tetraspanins in these interactions (12Bradbury L.E. Goldmacher V.S. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2915-2927PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yauch R.L. Berditchevski F. Harler M.B. Reichner J. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2751-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the region critical for the interaction of CD4 with CD81/TAPA-1 was mapped to the juxtamembrane portion of CD4 cytoplasmic tail (14Imai T. Kakizaki M. Nishimura M. Yoshie O. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1229-1239PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, both cytoplasmic and extracellular domains of CD4 are required for its association with CD82 (14Imai T. Kakizaki M. Nishimura M.

In most of these studies to prevent dissociation of the integrin·tetraspanin complexes the analysis (e.g.immunoprecipitation) was carried out in the presence of so-called “non-stringent,” less hydrophobic detergents (e.g.CHAPS, various Brij detergents). Although solubilization of the complexes with non-stringent detergents allows assessing the specificity of the association, this approach precludes a detailed mapping analysis of the integrin·tetraspanin interactions. Indeed, under these experimental conditions the immunoprecipitated complexes include a varying number of tetraspanins and some other transmembrane proteins thereby complicating a pair-wise analysis of a particular protein·protein interaction. We have previously shown that the interaction of tetraspanin CD151 with the α3β1 integrin could be observed under the experimental conditions that dissociated all other integrin·tetraspanin complexes (e.g. in the presence of Triton X-100) (13Yauch R.L.

Not only did these data suggest a close proximity of CD151 and α3β1, but they also pointed to a critical role this tetraspanin might play in the regulation of other α3β1·tetraspanin interactions. Thus, thorough assessment of the α3β1·CD151 association (under both “stringent” and “non-stringent” conditions) may prove to be crucial for understanding the assembly and function of the integrin·tetraspanin web. It has been recently illustrated that the resistance of the α3β1·CD151 complex to Triton X-100 was lost when a C-terminal region of the CD151 LECL (a sequence between residues Lys186 and Gln217) was substituted for the corresponding residues of tetraspanin NAG-2/Tspan-4 (24Yauch R.L. Kazarov A.R. Desai B. Lee R.T. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9230-9238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Because a reciprocal chimeric protein has not been examined in this study, it was possible that this “loss-of-function” substitution within CD151 affected overall folding of the LECL rather than specifically removed the sequences that were engaged in interaction with the integrin. In addition, it remains unclear whether other parts of the CD151 LECL can contribute to the incorporation of the protein into the tetraspanin web. In this report we utilized a large panel of the CD151 mutants to carry out a detailed examination of the α3β1·CD151 and tetraspanin·CD151 interactions. We found that the 186–217 region of the CD151 LECL was necessary but not sufficient to confer a stable interaction of the tetraspanin with α3β1. We showed that, although the assembly of the α3β1·CD151 complex is an early step during the integrin biosynthesis, the association with other tetraspanins is likely to occur when CD151 is delivered to the cell surface and it does not involve the CD151 LECL.

The cells were plated in serum-free L-15 media on glass coverslips coated with the laminin-5-containing extracellular matrix (prepared as described previously (31Berditchevski F. Odintsova E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar)). In other experiments cells were grown on glass coverslips in complete media for 24–36 h. Spread cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10–15 min. After subsequent washes with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 1% Brij 98/PBS for 1.5 min (or left untreated). In some experiments fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1%Triton X-100/PBS for 30 s. The staining with primary and fluorochrome-conjugated secondary Abs was carried out as previously described (32Golberg A.F.X. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13726-13730Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The staining was analyzed using the Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. Images were acquired using the Leica DC200 digital camera and subsequently processed using the DC200 image processing program. The proteins were solubilized into the immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1% Brij 98/PBS (or 1% Triton X-100/PBS), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin for 2–16 h at 4 °C. The insoluble material was pelleted at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and the cell lysates were precleared by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C with agarose beads conjugated with goat anti-mouse antibodies (Sigma). Immune complexes were collected on the agarose beads that were prebound with mAbs, followed by four washes with the immunoprecipitation buffer. Immune complexes were eluted from the beads with Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved in 11% SDS-PAGE, transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane, and developed with the appropriate Ab. Protein bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and Enhanced Chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). Cells were incubated with saturating concentrations of primary mouse mAbs for 45 min at 4 °C, washed twice, and then labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin. Stained cells were analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, UK). The cells were labeled with 1 mCi of EXPRE35S35S (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 15 min in the serum-, methionine-, and cysteine-free MEM and subsequently chased for various time intervals with the complete DMEM containing 10% FCS. The immunoprecipitation was carried out as described in the above section. The gel pretreated with the Amplifier (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was dried and exposed to the x-ray Kodak film at −70 °C. In this study our goal was to identify the regions within CD151 that are critical for the interactions of the protein with the α3β1 integrin and with other tetraspanins. Previous studies have shown that stability of the CD9·α3β1 complex is compromised in the presence of Triton X-100 (18Berditchevski F. Zutter M.M. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Hence, to delineate the sequences required for mediating tight (e.g. Triton X-100-resistant) association of CD151 with the α3β1integrin, a series of the chimeric CD9-CD151 cDNA constructs were generated (Fig. 1). To avoid antibody counter-reactivity toward the endogenous CD9 and CD151 (both tetraspanins are widely expressed on cultured human cells), the association of the chimeric proteins with α3β1 was analyzed in the CHOA3B1 hamster cells (a variant of CHO cells that expresses human α3β1 integrin). The immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that in CHOA3B1 cells wild-type human CD151 is associated with the α3β1 in the presence of both Triton X-100 and Brij 98 (Fig.2A, lanes 1 and2). On the other hand, the association of human CD9 with the integrin can be observed only when the immunoprecipitation is carried out in Brij 98 (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and4). These results established that the detergent sensitivity of the CD151·α3β1 and CD9·α3β1 complexes purified from the hamster cells was similar to that observed in human cells. Hence, the CHOA3B1 cells represent a suitable model system to carry out the biochemical analysis of the CD9/CD151 chimeras. The association of the chimeric proteins (SW-series) with the α3β1integrin was examined by the immunoprecipitation→Western blotting protocol using both Brij 98 and Triton X-100. As illustrated in Fig. 2B, in the presence of Triton X-100 the α3β1 integrin was co-immunoprecipitated only when the chimeric proteins included the LECL of the CD151 (e.g. chimeras SW2, SW4, and SW6) (lanes 4,8, and 10). In contrast, when this region of the protein was substituted for a corresponding part of CD9 (chimeras SW1 and SW3) the association was detected only in the presence of Brij 98 (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 5). In the control experiments we showed that comparable amounts of the SW1 and SW3 proteins were immunoprecipitated from both Brij 98 and Triton X-100 cellular lysates (results not shown). In addition, we examined the association of α3β1 with the truncated variants of CD151 (mutants CD151/Δ1, CD151/Δ2, and CD151/Δ3 (Fig.1)). In the Δ mutants various parts of CD151 that preceded the LECL were deleted. Fig. 2C shows that all three truncated proteins could be co-immunoprecipitated with α3β1 from both Brij 98 and Triton X-100 lysates. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the presence of the CD151 LECL (the amino acid sequence between residues Leu118 and Glu213) is necessary and sufficient for mediating stable (e.g. Triton-resistant) association of the tetraspanin with the integrin. A computer-based analysis of the large extracellular loops of all tetraspanins in the GenBank™ data base (BLAST algorithm) indicate that there are three unique regions within LECL of CD151 that show no similarity to the corresponding sequences of any other member of the family (sequences between the amino acids 119–150, 166–181, and 194–206). We therefore hypothesized that one of these regions may be important for mediating tight association of CD151 with α3β1. To investigate this idea we generated mutants of CD151 in which two of these regions (120–148 and 195–205) were swapped for the corresponding CD9 sequences (chimeras SW7 and SW10, respectively (Fig. 1)). The immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that the α3β1·SW7 complex was resistant to the presence of Triton X-100 (Fig.3, lane 2). Notably, due to poor extractability of SW7 protein we were unable to detect the signal when cells were lysed in Brij 98 (Fig. 3, lane 1). These results showed that, although the 120–148 region of the CD151 LECL was not required for mediating stable association with α3β1, it might regulate other properties of the protein. In agreement with this conclusion we found that the protein, in which the first 148 amino acids of CD151 were replaced for the CD9 sequence (SW5 chimera (Fig. 1)), also formed a stable complex with the integrin and was poorly extracted from the cells by Brij 98 (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, the α3β1·SW10 complex was sensitive to Triton X-100 (Fig. 3, compare lanes 5 and 6) thereby suggesting that the 195–205 region of CD151 was important. To substantiate this conclusion further we generated a reciprocal chimera, in which this sequence was embedded into the LECL of CD9 (SW8 chimera (Fig. 1)). Surprisingly, the SW8 protein also failed to form a stable complex with α3β1 (Fig. 3, comparelanes 7 and 8). Hence, by itself the CD151195–205 sequence does not confer the stable association of the chimeric protein with α3β1. Finally, we tested the interaction of α3β1 integrin with the SW9 chimera. This chimeric protein contains the CD151 sequence that includes the second and third unique regions"

Three different pathways have been suggested to be involved in the inhibition of ERK by cAMP: 1) cAMP-activated PKA phosphorylates Rap1, which induces Rap1 GTP-binding by an unknown mechanism, resulting in competition with Ras for the binding of Raf-1 and thereby blocking Ras-induced Raf-1 activation (9Schmitt J.M.

Inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathways by cAMP has been reported in Swiss 3T3, HEK293, COS, and Rat2 cells, although the mechanism(s) by which this occurs is largely uncharacterized (22Kim S. Jee K. Kim D.

Rat C6 glioma cells are one of the well established glioma cell lines used for a variety of studies related to glioma cell biology (23Barth R.F. J. Neurooncol. 1998; 36: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that cAMP inhibits both C6 cell growth and expression of the autocrine growth factor IGF-I (24Wang L. Adamo M.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3041-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The addition of exogenous IGF-I peptide to cAMP-treated C6 cells only partially prevents the decrease in cell growth caused by cAMP treatment, suggesting that cAMP inhibits C6 cell growth by another mechanism(s) in addition to down-regulation of IGF-I gene expression. It has been reported that cAMP inhibits ERK activity in both primary astrocytes and C6 cells (6Dugan L.L. Kim J.S. Zhang Y. Bart R.D. Sun Y. Holtzman D.M. Gutmann D.H. J. Biol.

This inactivation of ERK has been proposed to mediate the inhibitory effect of cAMP on astrocyte or C6 cell growth, although as described above, the mechanism(s) by which cAMP inhibits ERK remains to be clarified. In this study, we showed that cAMP inhibited ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways by inhibiting Rap1 activity in C6 cells. Neither PKA nor Epac (Exchangeprotein directly activated by cAMP) was involved in the cAMP-dependent inactivation of ERK and Akt. Moreover, the inhibition of these two pathways contributes to cAMP effects on cellular gene expression and growth. Rat C6 glioma cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Ham's F12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and supplemented with antibiotics as described (24Wang L. Adamo M.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3041-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Prior to treatments, C6 cells were incubated in Ham's F12 containing 1% FBS for 24 h. 8-(4-Chloropenylthio)-cAMP (8-CPT-cAMP), forskolin, isoproterenol, glutathione-agarose beads, and protein A-Sepharose beads were purchased from Sigma.

A vector containing p110*, a constitutively active form of PI3K, was provided by Drs. Anke Klippel and Lewis T. Williams (Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA). The empty vector for p110* (p110 vector) was generated by releasing the p110* insert from theXbaI and BamHI sites of the vector. PKA-REVab, a dominant negative form of PKA, PKA-CEVα, an active form of PKA, and their parental vector Zem3 were kind gifts from Dr. G. Stanley McKnight (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). An active form of Epac (EpacΔcAMP), its parental vector pmt2-HA, and RalGDS GST-RBD constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Johannes L. Bos (University Medical Center, Utrecht, Netherlands). The pcDNA3 was from Invitrogen, and Flag-Rap1 and Flag-Rap1GAP1 were generous gifts from Dr. Philip J. Stork (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). C6 cells were plated in 60-mm plates (Corning, Corning, NY) at 5 × 105 cells/60-mm plate and were grown for 3 days in complete medium. Transient transfection was then performed using 2 μg of the expression vector(s) or its respective parental vector, with the LipofectAMINE Plus system (Life Technologies, Inc.) in Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Three hours after transfection, Opti-MEM medium was replaced with Ham's F-12 medium containing 1% FBS. After 24 h, 100 μm8-CPT-cAMP was added into the conditioned medium. Cells transfected with HA-ERK2 were then harvested after 30 min, and cells transfected with Myc-Akt were harvested after 3 h. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm β-glycerol-phosphate for 30 min on ice. Lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 20 min, and supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation or Western immunoblot. For immunoprecipitation studies, cell lysates were incubated with specific antibodies precoupled to protein A-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. After incubation, immunoprecipitates were collected and washed twice with wash buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in Laemmli buffer. Immunoprecipitates or cell lysate proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked in TTBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat dry milk. The blots were then incubated with the appropriate primary and secondary antibody, with each incubation followed by washing in TTBS. Proteins in the membrane were detected by exposure to film after incubation with Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Two hundred μg of cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipiated with anti-Akt antibody precoupled to protein A-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation and then washed twice with wash buffer and once with reaction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The precipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of reaction buffer with 3 μg of histone H2B, 2 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol). The reaction was carried out for 15 min at room temperature and stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer. The reaction products were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiographic visualization of 32P-labeled H2B. Activated Rap1,i.e. Rap1GTP, was isolated from cell lysate proteins using a protocol provided by Dr. Johannes L. Bos, which was adapted from Ref. 27Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar. The RalGDS GST-RBD fusion protein, which contains a binding site (RBD) for Rap1GTP, was expressed in bacteria by growing them to an A600 between 0.6 and 1 followed by induction of protein expression with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The bacteria were spun down and lysed in bacteria lysis buffer (9/400 of the original culture volume) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10% glycerol, and 1% Nonidet P-40 with sonication 8 to 10 times for 30 s each. The bacterial lysates were then spun down, and 150 μl of the supernatant was incubated with 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rotation. Beads containing bound RalGDS GST-RBD were then pelleted and washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. C6 cell lysate proteins were then incubated with these glutathione-agarose beads coupled to RalGDS GST-RBD fusion protein for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Beads were pelleted and washed four times with lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted from the beads with Laemmli buffer and detected by Western immunoblot using anti-Flag or anti-Rap1 antibodies for transfected Flag-Rap1 or endogenous Rap1 proteins, respectively. Total RNA was prepared using the Ultraspec reagent (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). RNA concentrations were determined using the absorbance at 260 nm. Antisense RNA probes were labeled and synthesized using the protocol described previously (28Adamo M.L. Stannard B. Leroith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. de Pableo F. Scanes C.G. Weitraub B.D. Handbook of Endocrine Research Techniques. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 421-455Google Scholar) with reagents from Promega (Madison, WI) and Ambion (Austin, TX), and [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol). Solution hybridization/RNase protection assays were conducted using the protocol described previously (28Adamo M.L. Stannard B. Leroith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. de Pableo F. Scanes C.G. Weitraub B.D. Handbook of Endocrine Research Techniques. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 421-455Google Scholar) with reagents supplied by Ambion. The antisense RNA probes used in this study to measure levels of rat IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and β-actin mRNAs were described previously (24Wang L. Adamo M.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3041-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar,29Wang L. Ma X. Yeh L.C. Adamo M.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). C6 cells were plated in 48-well cell culture clusters (Corning) at 5 × 104 cells per well in complete Ham's F-12 medium and were cultured for 24 h followed by another 24-h incubation in Ham's F-12 medium with 1% FBS in place of 10% FBS. Cells were then treated with 8-CPT-cAMP, PD98059, or LY294002 in Ham's F-12 medium containing 1% FBS. Twenty-four hours later, 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine was added into each well. After a 4-h incubation, C6 cells were harvested for scintillation counting as described previously (24Wang L. Adamo M.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3041-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). C6 cells were plated in 100-mm plates (Corning) at 1.4 × 106 cells/100-mm plate and grown for 24 h in complete medium followed by a 24-h incubation in Ham's F-12 medium with 1% FBS in place of 10% FBS. Cells were then treated with or without 100 μm 8-CPT-cAMP. Twenty-four hours later, cells were trypsinized, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at −20 °C. Cells were then pelleted, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and treated with 250 μg/μl RNase A (DNase-free, Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA). Cells were illuminated with 15 milliwatts of 488 nm argon-ion laser light. Propidium iodide fluorescence was read through a 625/35 nm band-pass filter. Typically, 40,000 cells were counted for each sample, and data were analyzed using the ModFit LT V2.0 DNA analysis program from Verity Software House, Inc. (Topsham, ME). When C6 cells were treated with 100 μm 8-CPT-cAMP, a synthetic cell-permeable cAMP analogue, the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 were reduced at 30 min to 6 h after cAMP addition but returned back to near control levels at 12 and 24 h (Fig.1A). Total ERK1/2 protein levels were not altered by cAMP (Fig. 1A). Forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, and isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic receptor agonist, both of which should increase intracellular cAMP levels, also inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels at 30 min after treatment (Fig. 1B). Because phosphorylation levels of ERKs are an indicator of ERK activation, these results strongly suggest that a cAMP-dependent signaling pathway inhibits ERK activity in C6 glioma cells, consistent with previous reports (6Dugan L.L.

Cyclic AMP exerts differential effects on Akt activity depending on the specific cell types (19Cass L.A. Summers S.A. Prendergast G.V. Backer J.M. Birnbaum M.J. Meinkoth J.L. Mol. Cell.

Treatment of C6 cells with 100 μm 8-CPT-cAMP caused a reduction in levels of Akt phosphorylated at the Ser-473 site in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The inhibition was maximal at 3 h after treatment and was sustained for at least 24 h after treatment (Fig. 2A). Akt phosphorylation at Thr-308 was detectable only using much higher amounts of cell lysate proteins requiring immunoprecipitation with anti-Akt antibody prior to immunoblot. Phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308 was inhibited by 8-CPT-cAMP in a time-dependent pattern similar to that at Ser-473 (Fig. 2B). Phosphorylation of both Thr-308 and Ser-473 is essential for Akt activation (30Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 210-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Total Akt protein levels were not altered by 8-CPT-cAMP treatment (Fig. 2, A and B). Increasing intracellular cAMP levels by treatment with forskolin or isoproterenol also reduced Akt phosphorylation at both the Ser-473 and Thr-308 sites (Fig. 2C). Neither of these agents altered total Akt levels. The inhibition of Thr-308 phosphorylation by cAMP appeared to be more potent than that of Ser-473. This inhibitory effect of cAMP on Akt activation was confirmed by in vitro Akt kinase assay using histone H2B as substrate. Akt activity was potently decreased by cAMP, forskolin, or isoproterenol (Fig. 2C), showing that Akt phosphorylation levels indeed reflect its activation state. In order to use transfected ERK or Akt to study the signaling pathways by which cAMP inhibits ERK and Akt activation in C6 cells, we first determined the effect of cAMP on transfected HA-tagged ERK2 or Myc-tagged Akt phosphorylation. The time of cAMP treatment was chosen based on our observation that maximal inhibition of endogenous ERK and Akt phosphorylation by cAMP occurred at 30 min (Fig. 1A) and 3 h (Fig. 2, A and B), respectively. Phosphorylation of transfected ERK was inhibited by treatment with 8-CPT-cAMP for 30 min (Fig.3A), which is consistent with the changes in endogenous ERK phosphorylation in response to cAMP. Phosphorylation of transfected Akt at both Thr-308 and Ser-473 was inhibited by cAMP after 3 h, and phosphorylation of Thr-308 appeared to be more susceptible to inhibition by cAMP (Fig.3B) similar to what was observed for endogenous Akt. A previous study demonstrated that cAMP inhibits Akt activity in a number of cell lines by altering the subcellular localization of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 as a consequence of PI3K inactivation (22Kim S. Jee K. Kim D. Koh H. Chung J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12864-12870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To confirm that inhibition of Akt by cAMP is a result of PI3K inhibition in C6 cells, a constitutively active form of the PI3K catalytic subunit (p110*) was co-transfected with the Akt expression vector in C6 cells. Akt phosphorylation levels were elevated by p110* in the absence of cAMP (Fig. 4), presumably as a result of increasing phosphatidylinositol 3′-phosphate production. Moreover, p110* prevented the decrease in Akt phosphorylation levels caused by cAMP treatment (Fig. 4). These results support the hypothesis that cAMP inhibits Akt activity by inhibiting PI3K. cAMP-mediated effects in eukaryotes have traditionally been considered the result of cAMP binding to the regulatory subunits of the PKA tetramer, leading to the activation of the PKA catalytic subunits and subsequent phosphorylation of cellular substrates (31Beebe S.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 285-294PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the inhibition of ERK and Akt by cAMP is mediated by PKA, C6 cells were pre-incubated with or without H89, a specific PKA inhibitor, prior to treatment with 8-CPT-cAMP. We have previously shown that H89 effectively blocks cAMP-induced PKA activation in C6 cells (24Wang L. Adamo M.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3041-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). H89 did not alter the ERK1/2 phosphorylation either in the presence or in the absence of cAMP (Fig.5A), suggesting that PKA is not involved in the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by cAMP. This conclusion is supported by the findings that a dominant negative form of PKA (PKA-REVab) did not block the cAMP inhibitory effect on ERK phosphorylation and that overexpression of an active form of PKA (PKA-CEVα) had a minor effect on ERK phosphorylation (Fig.5B). With respect to Akt, H89 alone did not alter the phosphorylation at Ser-473, whereas it actually reduced phosphorylation at Thr-308 (Fig.5C). Nevertheless, Akt phosphorylation at both Ser-473 and Thr-308 was inhibited by cAMP even in the presence of H89 (Fig.5C). Expression of the dominant negative PKA neither affected basal Akt phosphorylation nor did it prevent the cAMP from inhibiting Akt (Fig. 5D). Moreover, the active form of PKA did not inhibit Akt (Fig. 5D). Thus, cAMP appears to inhibit both ERK and Akt phosphorylation in a PKA-independent manner. Because PKA was not involved in the inhibition of ERK and Akt by cAMP (Fig. 5), we assessed the possible involvement of another cAMP effector, Epac, a recently discovered cAMP-dependent guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which is activated upon cAMP binding and then stimulates Rap1 (32de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar, 33Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S.

A plasmid encoding an Epac protein lacking the cAMP-binding domain (EpacΔcAMP), which represents an activated version of this exchange factor (32de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar), was co-transfected with Rap1, ERK, or Akt expression vector in C6 cells. As shown in Fig.6A, EpacΔcAMP expression increased Flag-Rap1 GTP binding but did not alter total transfected Flag-Rap1 protein levels, indicating that EpacΔcAMP is indeed an active form of Epac. If cAMP inhibits ERK and Akt by activating Epac, EpacΔcAMP should mimic cAMP effects. However, we found that EpacΔcAMP increased rather than decreased phosphorylation of ERK and Akt in the absence of cAMP (Fig. 6, B and C), suggesting that activation of Epac may increase ERK and Akt phosphorylation. Moreover, in the presence of EpacΔcAMP, the phosphorylation levels of ERK and Akt were still inhibited by cAMP (Fig. 6, B and C). These results suggest that Epac is unlikely to mediate the inhibitory signal from cAMP to ERK or Akt that we have observed in C6 cells. Rap1 has been shown to function as a regulator of ERK and Akt pathways in response to cAMP (9Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3671-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 12Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.

https://openalex.org/W1995054863,"The genes coding for two different proteins with homologies to glutaredoxins have been identified in the genome of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Both genes were amplified from a gametocytic cDNA and overexpressed inEscherichia coli. The smaller protein (named PfGrx-1) with 12.4 kDa in size exhibits the typical glutaredoxin active site motif “CPYC,” shows glutathione-dependent glutaredoxin activity in the β-hydroxyethyl disulfide (HEDS) assay, and reducesTrypanosoma brucei ribonucleotide reductase. Glutathione:HEDS transhydrogenase activity (approximately 60 milliunits/mg of protein) was clearly detectable in trophozoite extracts from eight different P. falciparum strains and did not differ between chloroquine-resistant and -sensitive parasites. Five different antimalarial drugs at 100 μm did not significantly influence isolated PfGrx-1 activity. In contrast, the second protein (deduced mass 19.9 kDa) with homology to glutaredoxins (31% identity to Schizosaccharomyces pombe in a 140-amino acid overlap) was not active in the HEDS assay; however, its general dithiol reducing activity was demonstrated in the insulin assay in the presence of dithiothreitol. Interestingly, the sequence contains a PICOT (for protein kinase C-interacting cousin of thioredoxin) homology domain, which might suggest regulatory functions of the protein. We named this protein PfGLP-1, for P. falciparum1-Cys-glutaredoxin-like protein-1. In contrast to glutaredoxins, PfGLP-1 could not be reduced by glutathione. This is the first report on glutaredoxin-like proteins in the family ofPlasmodia. The genes coding for two different proteins with homologies to glutaredoxins have been identified in the genome of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Both genes were amplified from a gametocytic cDNA and overexpressed inEscherichia coli. The smaller protein (named PfGrx-1) with 12.4 kDa in size exhibits the typical glutaredoxin active site motif “CPYC,” shows glutathione-dependent glutaredoxin activity in the β-hydroxyethyl disulfide (HEDS) assay, and reducesTrypanosoma brucei ribonucleotide reductase. Glutathione:HEDS transhydrogenase activity (approximately 60 milliunits/mg of protein) was clearly detectable in trophozoite extracts from eight different P. falciparum strains and did not differ between chloroquine-resistant and -sensitive parasites. Five different antimalarial drugs at 100 μm did not significantly influence isolated PfGrx-1 activity. In contrast, the second protein (deduced mass 19.9 kDa) with homology to glutaredoxins (31% identity to Schizosaccharomyces pombe in a 140-amino acid overlap) was not active in the HEDS assay; however, its general dithiol reducing activity was demonstrated in the insulin assay in the presence of dithiothreitol. Interestingly, the sequence contains a PICOT (for protein kinase C-interacting cousin of thioredoxin) homology domain, which might suggest regulatory functions of the protein. We named this protein PfGLP-1, for P. falciparum1-Cys-glutaredoxin-like protein-1. In contrast to glutaredoxins, PfGLP-1 could not be reduced by glutathione.

They are ubiquitously distributed and were found first in bacteria (1Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), then also in eukaria (2Luthman M. Eriksson S. Holmgren A. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Glutaredoxins belong to the thioredoxin superfamily, of which thioredoxins (Trx), tryparedoxin, and protein-disulfide isomerases are further members (7Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). They all show a similar structure, the “thioredoxin or glutaredoxin fold,” which consists of a central four-stranded β-sheet surrounded by α-helices. As shown for yeast, at least one out of four Grx and Trx genes must be present for viability (8Draculic T. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Classical glutaredoxins have an active site with two conserved cysteine residues, Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys, of which the N-terminal cysteine has been shown to be essential for both protein-disulfide reduction and reduction of mixed protein-glutathione disulfides (9Bushweller, J. H., Aslund, F., Wuthrich, K., and Holmgren, A. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 9288–9293Google Scholar). The C-terminal cysteine residue is required for protein-disulfide reduction but not for reduction of mixed protein disulfides. Glutaredoxin contributes to a range of important cellular processes. It is an important redox active protein protecting against oxidative damage (10Luikenhuis S. Perrone G. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), it serves as a hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase (7Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 11Holmgren A. Aslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and it is associated with transcriptional control (12Hirota K. Matsui M. Murata M. Takashima Y. Cheng F.S. Itoh T. Fukuda K. Junji Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Grx is involved in vaccinia virion morphogenesis (13White C.L. Weisberg A.S. Moss B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9175-9183Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and has even been detected in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (14Davis D.A. Newcomb F.M. Starke D.W. Ott D.E. Mieyal J.J. Yarchoan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25935-25940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Many organisms including Escherichia coli, yeast, and mammals have more than one Grx. Even in the phage T4, where genetic space is limited, two glutaredoxins are encoded (15Gvakharia B.O. Hanson E. Koonin E.K. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15307-15310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, as shown by genome sequencing, there are also organisms like Mycoplasma, which appear to lack a glutathione/glutaredoxin system (16Himmelreich R. Hilbert H. Plagens H. Pirkl E. Li B.C. Herrmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4420-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). The transcription of genes contributing to Grx and Trx pathways and related enzymes is regulated in bacteria in response to oxidative stress (17Prieto-Alamo M.J. Jurado J. Gallardo-Madueno R. Monje-Casas F. Holmgren A. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13398-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of Grx-like proteins including Grx3 to Grx5 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and also the second glutaredoxin-like protein studied here have been grouped into one family of so-called PICOT-HD (protein kinase C-interacting cousin of thioredoxin homology domain)-containing proteins of yet unknown function (18Isakov N. Witte S. Altman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 537-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Witte S. Villalba M. Bi K. Liu Y. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum is known to be exposed to high fluxes of reactive oxygen species. The parasite multiplies in erythrocytes, an environment of high oxygen tension. Furthermore, toxic heme products, derived from heme degradation by the parasite, represent a continuous source of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, proteins involved in antioxidant defense are promising targets for antimalarial drug development (20Schirmer R.H. Müller J.G. Krauth-Siegel L. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 141-154Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). P. falciparum has recently been shown to possess a functional thioredoxin system comprising NADPH, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and thioredoxin (21Kanzok S.M. Schirmer R.H. Turbachova I. Iozef R. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40180-40186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 22Krnajski Z. Gilberger T. Walter R.D. Muller S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, thioredoxin-dependent peroxidases have recently been characterized (23Rahlfs S. Becker K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1404-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as well as a 1-Cys-peroxiredoxin with yet unknown dependence (24Kawazu S. Tsuji N. Hatabu T. Kawai S. Matsumoto Y. Kano S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 109: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Glutathione peroxidase of P. falciparum(25Gamain B. Langsley G. Fourmaux M.N. Touzel J.P. Camus D. Dive D. Slomianny C. Mol. Biochem.

In parallel, a functional glutathione system comprising NADPH, an FAD-dependent homodimeric glutathione reductase (PfGR), and glutathione exists in P. falciparum. PfGR has been studied in detail (27Farber P.M. Becker K. Muller S. Schirmer R.H. Franklin R.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Farber P.M.

Biochem. 1996; 235: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here we describe for the first time the presence of a functional glutaredoxin in P. falciparum, and demonstrate the presence of a second, glutaredoxin-like protein, which shares similarities with PICOT-HD-containing proteins. All chemicals used were of the highest available purity and were obtained from Roth or Merck, HEDS was from Lancaster, and insulin and the inhibitors studied were obtained from Sigma/Aldrich. The cloning vector pBluescriptSK+ was obtained from Stratagene, the expression system QIAexpress (vector pQE30, E. coli host strain M15, and Ni2+-NTA matrices for purification of His-tagged protein) was purchased from Qiagen. PCR primers were obtained from MWG-Biotech, the sequencing reactions were carried out by MWG-Biotech. PfGR was recombinantly produced and purified as described previously (28Farber P.M. Arscott L.D Williams Jr, C.H. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and kindly placed at our disposal by Prof. R. Heiner Schirmer (Biochemistry Center, Heidelberg, Germany). Two complete open reading frames of two different glutaredoxin-like genes were identified by online screening of the P. falciparum genome sequencing project on chromosome 3 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Malaria/plasmodiumblcus.html). Four homologous primers were derived from these genes. For subsequent cloning procedures, restriction site sequences (underlined) were introduced forBamHI and HindIII at the 5′ end of the respective primers (primer for Pfgrx-1, N-terminal (Opfgrx-1f; 5′-CGCGGGATCCGCTGGTACAAGTGAAGCAGTTAAAAAATGG-3′) and C-terminal (Opfgrx-1r; 5′-GCGCAAGCTTTCAATTGACTAATCCCAATTTTTGTAG-3′); primer for Pfglp-1, N-terminal (Opfglp-1f, 5′-CGCGGGATCCATAATGAAAAACAAATATGGAG-3′) and C-terminal (Opfglp-1r; 5′-GCGCAAGCTTTTATTTTATAATTTTTTCCAAC-3′). A gametocyte cDNA library from the P. falciparum strain 3D7 was kindly provided by Prof. David Kaslow (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (30Rawlings D.J. Kaslow D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3976-3982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used as template to amplify the two glutaredoxin genes by PCR. The PCR was carried out with Taq polymerase (2.5 min at 94 °C; 94 °C, 30 s; 66 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 45 s; 25 cycles, 72 °C, 2 min) and the derived fragments of correct size were cloned into pBluescript SK+for sequencing and for subcloning into the expression vector pQE30. The E. coli strain M15 was used for expression of the P. falciparum glutaredoxin-like genes. Competent cells were transformed with the respective pQE30/grx plasmid. Five ml of LB medium was inoculated with a single colony and used as a starter culture for 250- or 500-ml cultures. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml) to anA600 of 0.5; subsequently, the expression was induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were grown for an additional 4 h, harvested, and directly used for protein purification or frozen at −20 °C. For purification, the cells were disintegrated by sonication in the presence of protease-inhibitors. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. After washing the column with increasing imidazole concentrations, the respective protein was eluted with 175–200 mm imidazole; collected fractions were tested for enzymatic activity and for purity by 15% SDS gel electrophoresis. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated via ultrafiltration, and dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, prior to use. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad dye assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard and on the basis of the calculated extinction coefficient of the protein (ε280 nm for His-tagged recombinant proteins: PfGrx-1, 9.62 mm−1 cm−1; PfGLP-1, 19.80 mm−1 cm−1). One ml of assay mixture containing 100 μm NADPH, 1 unit of PfGR (as determined with GSH as substrate; it was taken care that the PfGR concentration did not become rate-limiting), and 1 mm GSH was equilibrated to 25 °C. After addition of glutaredoxin, the reaction was started with 735 μm HEDS. NADPH consumption (ε340 nm = 6.22 mm−1cm−1) was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (11Holmgren A. Aslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In this coupled assay system, constantly high concentrations of reduced glutathione were maintained by the NADPH/GR system. The activities were corrected for the rate of the spontaneous chemical reaction of HEDS with GSH by using a reference cuvette that did not contain glutaredoxin. One ml of reaction mixture contained 0.17 mm porcine insulin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The reaction was started at 25 °C by adding 1 mm DTT in the absence and presence of 10 μm PfGrx-1, PfGLP-1-N, and PfTrx, respectively. The precipitation of insulin reduced to A and B chains was followed turbidimetrically at 600 nm (31Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ribonucleotide reductase activity was determined from the rate of conversion of [3H]GDP into [3H]dGDP essentially as described for CDP reduction (32Engström Y. Eriksson S. Thelander L. Akerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained in a total volume of 200 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 500 μm GDP (including 1.25 μCi of [3H]GDP), 100 μm dTTP, 100 mm KCl, 6.4 mmMgCl2, 400 μm NADPH, 400 milliunits of human glutathione reductase, 4 mm reduced glutathione, and various concentrations of glutaredoxin (0.1–3 μm). In the assay 1.9 μm Trypanosoma bruceiribonucleotide reductase subunit R1 with an excess of R2 (26.9 μm) was used (1 unit corresponds to 1 nmol of dGDP formation/min). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by boiling for 10 min, and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. The reaction components were dephosphorylated by 30-min incubation with 10 units of alkaline phosphatase. Guanosine, deoxyguanosine, and guanine were separated isocratically by high performance liquid chromatography on an Aminex A9 column (250 × 4 mm) in 100 mm ammonium borate, pH 8.3, and quantified by scintillation counting (33Willing A. Follmann H. Auling G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 170: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The effects of the antimalarial drugs chloroquine, primaquine, quinine, methylene blue, and artemisinin on PfGrx-1 were tested in the glutathione:HEDS transhydrogenase assay described above in the presence of 200 milliunits/ml GR. The respective drug at a concentration of 100 μm was added to the assay before the reaction was started with HEDS at 25 °C. Since PfGLP-1 was not active in the glutathione:HEDS transhydrogenase assay (see “Results”), the GSH dependence of the protein was tested in a GR-coupled reaction: Two different concentrations (8 and 16 μm) of PfGLP-1 and PfGrx-1 were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C with 1 mm GSH and 100 μm NADPH in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The total sample volume was 1 ml. The formation of GSSG was determined by adding 1 unit/ml PfGR and measuring total NADPH consumption in comparison with control samples. Intraerythrocytic stages of eight different P. falciparum strains (four chloroquine-sensitive strains (HB3, S106, D10, 3D7) and four chloroquine-resistant strains (Dd2, K1, 7G8, FCR3)) were culturedin vitro according to Trager and Jensen (34Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar), and synchronized to ring stages by the sorbitol method (35Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar). After approximately 30 h, parasites in the trophozoite stage were isolated by suspending the red cells in a 20-fold volume of buffer containing 7 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 11 mmNaHCO3, 58 mm KCl, 56 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 14 mm glucose, and 0.02% saponin for 10 min at 37 °C. The pellets were washed three times, and the parasites were diluted in 150 μl of the same buffer and disrupted by freezing and thawing three times. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used for the various analyses. The parasite extract was diluted in buffer (150 mm KH2PO4, pH 8.0), and on the basis of the absorbance at 280 nm and the Bio-Rad protein dye assay (with bovine serum albumin as standard) the protein concentration was calculated. Glutathione:HEDS transhydrogenase activity was determined with 50 μl of parasite extract as described above for the isolated PfGrx-1, however, in the presence of 0.5 unit/ml GR. Screening the Plasmodium genome sequencing data base with different known glutaredoxin sequences resulted in the identification of an expressed sequence tag clone sequence ofPlasmodium berghei (submitted as GenBank™ accession no.AF288686). A further search with this putative P. bergheiglutaredoxin-sequence led to a P. falciparum grx sequence (see Table I) which consists of 5 exons (Fig. 1). Perfect match primers were designed and a PCR was performed with PfcDNA as template. A fragment of expected size was obtained, cloned into pSK+, and completely sequenced. The sequence was in full agreement with the respective exon-sequences found in the genomic data base. ThePfgrx-1 gene is located on chromosome 3 and consists of 336 base pairs (GenBank™ accession no. AF276083). The amino acid sequence contains the typical active site motif CPYC, and an alignment with the putative P. berghei Grx amino acid sequence shows high identities of 71% (Fig. 2).Table IProperties of PfGrx-1 and PfGLP-1PfGrx-1PfGLP-1Accession no.GenBank™AF276083GenBank™ AY014839Location in P. falciparumgenomeChromosome 3Chromosome 3Genomic DNA numberingbp 118703–117655 (according to GenBank™ AL034558), comprises 5 exons1-cbp, base pair(s).bp 41725–42480 (according to GenBank™ AL034558, comprises 3 exons)mRNA336 bp (with start and stop codon)384 bp (with start and stop codon)516 bp with predicted MTSAmino acids111128 (171 with MTS)Molecular mass1-aDeduced, without His tag.12.4 kDa15.0 kDa (19.9 kDa with MTS)Highest identity on amino acid level71% to a putative P. berghei Grx (GenBank™ accession no.AF288686)41.5% to S. cerevisiae Grx5 (acc. no.

This sequence does not contain the typical active site motif CPYC. We cloned this unusual 516-base pair glutaredoxin-like gene, resubmitted the sequence to GenBank™ under the accession number AY014839, and named the respective proteinP. falciparum 1-Cys-glutaredoxin-like protein-1 (PfGLP-1). The two grx genes were each inserted into the expression vector pQE30. Freshly transformed E. coli M15 cells were used for production of the recombinant proteins with a yield of 15 mg of PfGrx-1/liter of cell culture and 5 mg of PfGLP-1/liter of cell culture. The N-terminal hexahistidyl tag contributed by the pQE vector allowed purification over Ni2+-NTA-agarose columns. All assays described in this paper (except for the data obtained with P. falciparumextracts) were carried out with the His-tagged proteins, the characteristics of which might differ slightly from the wild type enzymes. According to silver stained SDS gels, the proteins were >99% pure. The calculated molecular masses (of the His-tagged proteins) are 13.5 kDa for PfGrx-1 and 21 kDa for PfGLP-1. These values correspond well to the data obtained by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The concentrated glutaredoxins were stable at 4 °C over weeks. PfGrx-1 comprises 111 amino acids and has a deduced molecular mass of 12.4 kDa. Further characteristics of PfGrx-1 are summarized in Table I. PfGrx-1 was found to be highly active in the glutathione:HEDS transhydrogenase assay, which represents a typical feature of glutaredoxins. The specific activity of PfGrx-1 was determined to be 47 units/mg in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, in the presence of 1 mm GSH, 1 unit/ml GR, and 735 μm HEDS at 25 °C. For measuring Kmvalues, the respective substrate concentrations were systematically varied (300 μm to 4 mm for GSH and 150–735 μm for HEDS). In a reference cuvette without Grx-1, the rather strong spontaneous reaction between GSH and HEDS was subtracted. Under these conditions a Km value of 700 μm was determined for HEDS. Due to the strong reaction between GSH and HEDS, GSH concentrations higher than 4 mmcould not be tested. Graphical analysis of the data obtained for GSH concentrations between 300 μm and 4 mm in a Lineweaver-Burk plot resulted reproducibly in a Kmvalue of 8.5 mm. Since, however, GSH concentrations >4 mm could not be tested, we prefer to give aKm of >4 mm and will further evaluate this phenomenon when substrates other than HEDS have been identified for the enzyme. In the above glutathione:HEDS transhydrogenase assay, a pH profile of PfGrx-1 was carried out and indicated an optimum at pH 8.6 (see Fig.3). For comparability with previous studies and to guarantee appropriate activity of PfGR, we decided to perform further assays at the more physiological pH of 8.0. The addition of KCl to final concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 mm, respectively, did not enhance the enzyme activity. To test whether PfGrx-1 shares the remarkable temperature stability with other glutaredoxins (1Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As shown in Fig. 3, the protein was stable up to 60 °C; even after 10 min of incubation at 90 °C, it was 50% active. Antibodies for further investigations like immunolocalization and stage-specific expression studies are presently produced. In contrast to other glutaredoxins, PfGLP-1 lacks detectable activity in the glutathione:HEDS transhydrogenase assay. A computer algorithm (36Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar) predicted a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS, with a probability of 68.5%) with a possible cleavage site (37Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Prot. Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar) at position 43. The resulting protein has a size of 15 kDa. The MTS sequence was deleted from thePfglp-1 gene by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting gene was cloned as described above, and the respective recombinantly produced protein was named PfGLP-1-N. However, this new gene product was not active in the HEDS assay either. We therefore tested the GSH dependence of PfGLP-1-N and PfGrx-1 (as control) in a GR-coupled reaction; PfGLP-1-N and PfGrx-1, respectively, were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C with 1 mm GSH and 100 μm NADPH. Then, the formation of GSSG was determined by adding 1 unit/ml PfGR and measuring total NADPH (ε340 nm= 6.22 mm−1 cm−1) consumption. For the samples containing 16.5 μm PfGrx-1, an immediate decrease in absorbance of 0.106 was determined, which corresponds to an almost stoichiometric reduction of PfGrx-1. This result clearly supports the data from the HEDS assay and shows that PfGrx-1 is a typical glutaredoxin. For 8 and 16 μm PfGLP-1-N, however, the resulting change in absorbance did not significantly differ from control samples. This indicates that PfGLP-1-N cannot be reduced by GSH or, which is rather unlikely, is present in reduced state after purification and storage. PfGLP-1-N and PfGrx-1 were tested as substrates of PfTrxR. In the presence of 50 milliunits/ml PfTrxR (as determined in the DTNB assay), 100 μm NADPH, and 40 μm amount of the respective substrate (in 100 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, at 25 °C), no significant activity (ΔA/min < 0.001) was detected for PfGLP-1-N. PfGrx-1 was reduced with a ΔA/min of 0.010; the control with 40 μm PfTrx showed an immediate and complete reduction. To test PfGLP-1-N and PfGrx-1 for their general thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity, the insulin assay was applied. In this assay the putative redox-active proteins are reduced by DTT and in turn reduce disulfide bonds in insulin. The following precipitation of insulin is followed turbidimetrically.

SF-1 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of a variety of genes such as the steroid hydroxylase genes, the luteinizing hormone receptor, the adrenocorticotropin receptor, the prolactin receptor, and the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (5Hu Z.

Disruption of the SF-1 gene in mice leads to the complete agenesis of the adrenals and gonads and to abnormalities in the ventromedial hypothalamus (11Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L.

A mutation in the human gene encoding for SF-1 (FTZF1; fushi tarazu-related factor 1) has been described in a phenotypically female patient exhibiting primary adrenal failure and XY sex reversal (13Achermann J.C. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The ligand for SF-1 is still unknown. The activity of SF-1 is dependent on post-translational modifications. Phosphorylation-dependent SF-1 activation is mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase, and a single serine 203 residue in the activation function 1 domain is important in this process (14Hammer G.D.

SF-1 may be directly involved in the cAMP-dependent regulation of steroid hydroxylase, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, aromatase, and inhibin α-promoter gene expression (15Liu Z. Simpson E.R.

We have demonstrated previously that mutations in the activation function 2 domain of SF-1 also interfered with cAMP-regulated SF-1 activation in the bovine CYP17 gene (22Jacob A.L. Lund J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13391-13394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Modulation of SF-1 activity is also mediated by protein-protein interactions. SF-1 interacts directly with the coactivators CBP (CREB binding protein) and steroid receptor coactivator 1, and transactivation was enhanced synergistically in the presence of both coactivators (23Ito M., Yu, R.N. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Monte D. DeWitte F. Hum D.W. J. Biol.

The precise mechanisms responsible for the stimulatory effect on the transcriptional activity of SF-1 by these coactivators are not yet known. Both structural and mutational analyses have indicated that the presence of LXXLL domains in the coactivators is important for the interactions with nuclear receptors and may be involved in the recruitment of still other proteins into the transcriptional complex (25Westin S. Kurokawa R. Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Milburn M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 395: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 26Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E.

Nuclear receptor coactivators such as p300/CBP, GCN5 (general control nonderepressed), steroid receptor coactivator 1, p300/CBP-associated factor, and activator of thyroid and retinoic acid receptor exhibit HAT (histone acetyltransferase) activity. These HAT proteins acetylate nucleosomal histones, which further increase the accessibility of transcription factors to their DNA targets (27Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L. Kurokawa R.

SF-1 interacts with a HAT coactivator GCN5, and GCN5 acetylates SF-1 in vitro. Acetylation by GCN5 enhanced SF-1-mediated transactivation. Lysines 34, 38, and 72 in the C-terminal domain of zinc finger motifs of SF-1 might be among the target lysines being acetylated. Inhibition of deacetylation by trichostatin A (TSA) regulates the SF-1 activity at multiple levels. COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (low glucose), and Y-1 cells were maintained in DMEM (high glucose). COS-1 cells were transfected by the Superfectin (Qiagen) method according to standard procedures. For gene reporter assays, COS-1 cells (1.25 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates) and Y-1 cells (2.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates) were transfected. The calcium phosphate coprecipitation method was used to transfect Y-1 cells (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (22Jacob A.L. Lund J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13391-13394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Constructions of the reporter plasmid pT81-4CRS2LUC and the expression plasmid pCMV5-SF-1 are as described (35Bakke M. Lund J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 327-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A Myc-His-tagged SF-1 plasmid was generated by cloning a polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment of SF-1 into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His A vector (Invitrogen). For mutagenesis the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used (22Jacob A.L. Lund J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13391-13394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The SF-1 full-length cDNA was cloned into the pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The different GST constructs were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21-codonplus-RIL. Bacterial cells were grown in 37 °C and lysed with 50 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The GST-SF-1 fusion protein was purified with glutathione beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from bacterial lysates according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected COS-1 cells were washed with PBS and lysed with EBC (20 mmHepes, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) buffer. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with polyclonal antibodies against SF-1, and antibodies were captured by adding 100 μl of 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunopurified protein was solubilized with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis of SF-1 proteins was carried out with a polyclonal antiserum to Ad4BP-SF-1 (kindly provided by Dr. Ken Morohashi). Anti-myc-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Invitrogen) was used to detect myc-tagged SF-1 protein. The antibodies against hGCN5 (kindly provided by Dr. Shelley Berger) were used to detect GCN5 protein. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 15 μg of SF-1 expression plasmid or mutant plasmids was transfected into 1 × 10 6COS-1 cells/10-cm dish. After 24 h of transfection, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of DMEM containing 0.05 mCi/ml sodium [1-14C]acetate (39 mCi/mmol) (Sigma) and 2 μm TSA (Wako)/ml for 2 h. After incubation, DMEM was removed, and cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with EBC buffer. Equal amounts of lysates were used for immunoprecipitation. Immunopurified protein was solubilized with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Protein acetyltransferse assays for GST fusion proteins were performed as described previously (31Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar) with some modifications. GST fusion proteins were incubated with an equal amount of immunoprecipitated GCN5 in the presence of 2 μl of [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (59 mCi/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 37 °C. Proteins were solubilized with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. 10 μg of SF-1 expression plasmid was transfected into 1 × 10 6 COS-1 cells/10-cm dish. After 24 h of transfection, cells were starved for 1 h in methionine-free medium. Then the cells were labeled with methionine-free medium containing 0.25 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h. Radioactive medium was removed, and cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h (for time point zero) with a 10-fold excess of nonradioactive methionine. Cells were harvested thereafter for 1, 3, 6, and 24 h. Equal amounts of radioactive lysates were used for immunoprecipitation. Labeled proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted, and autoradiographed. Y-1 cells were transferred to glass coverslips and fixed for 15 min with 2% parafomaldehyde in PBS. Cells were permeabilized by incubating in 0.5% Triton X-100 in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. After blocking with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated with anti-SF-1 antibody for 2 h. Cells were washed with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h. After washing with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, cells were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield. Confocal microscopy was used for detection of SF-1 protein. The acetylation of lysine groups in transcription factors modulates their activity, both in vivo and in vitro (29Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 30Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 31Gu W.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The presence of GK amino acids in a motif seems to be required for acetylation, as shown by mutational analyses done on the importin-α protein (36Bannister A.J. Miska E.A. Gorlich D. Kouzarides T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 467-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Structural analyses of histone peptide acetylation by the HAT GCN5 also identified GKXXP as the recognition motif (37Rojas J.R. Trievel R.C. Zhou J. Mo Y. Li X. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Nature. 1999; 401: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In SF-1, the potential lysine motifs are identified C-terminal to the zinc finger domains, based on the previously reported consensus acetylation sequences (Fig.1B). In this study the lysines of the RFQK and KGFFK motifs were mutated to alanine. To determine SF-1 acetylation in vivo, COS-1 cells were transfected with an SF-1 expression plasmid or with mutant forms of SF-1. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were pulse labeled with 0.05 mCi/ml sodium [1-14C]acetate (39 mCi/mmol) for 2 h in the presence of histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA (2 μm). The cells were immediately lysed with EBC buffer and immunoprecipitated with an SF-1 antibody. As a control, nontransfected cells were pulse labeled and immunoprecipitated using the same conditions as above. The autoradiograph shown in Fig. 1Cdemonstrates the acetylation of the SF-1 and mutant proteins in COS-1 cells. No band is detected in the mock control. The presence of SF-1 and mutant proteins in the lysates is shown by Western blot (Fig.1D). RFQK and KGFFK mutants were characterized in COS-1 and mouse adrenocortical Y-1 cells. COS-1 cells were cotransfected with the reporter plasmid pT81-4CRS2LUC, and either wild-type SF-1 or mutant plasmids. The reporter plasmid contains the SF-1 binding site of the cytochrome P-450 17α-hydroxylase gene (CYP17). The transactivation effect of wild-type SF-1 and its mutants in COS-1 cells is shown in Fig.2A. Transactivation activity by the mutants in Y-1 cells, which express endogenous SF-1, is shown in Fig. 2B. Transfection of the plasmid with mutation in the RFQK domain, located C-terminal to the second zinc finger domain, positively increased transactivation in both cell types. Transfection of the plasmid with mutations in theKGFFK domain, which is C-terminal to the first zinc finger domain, showed reduced activity in both Y-1 and COS-1 cells. COS-1 cells transfected with either wild-type or mutant plasmids expressed equal amounts of the SF-1 protein (Fig. 2C). The HAT GCN5, the first identified acetyltransferase (38Berger S.L. Pina B.

Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar), was used to analyze the in vitro acetylation of SF-1. Acetylation of transcription factors p53, E2F1, erythroid Kruppel-like factor by GCN5 family members has been reported previously (29Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 32Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). We used immunoprecipitated GCN5 protein from COS-1 cells to analyze the in vitro acetylation of a GST-SF-1 fusion protein. Fig.3A shows that GCN5 acetylates the GST-SF-1 protein. A GST protein control was not acetylated by GCN5. Mutations in the RFQK or KGFFK motifs in the SF-1 protein show clear hypoacetylation (Fig.3B). To study the in vivo interaction of GCN5 with SF-1, 1 × 10 6COS-1 cells/10-cm dish were transfected with a myc-His-tagged SF-1 expression vector and incubated in presence of 1 μm TSA for 12 h. After 40 h of transfection the cells were lysed with EBC buffer and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against hGCN5. Detection of SF-1 (Fig. 3D) by Western blot analyses demonstrated that GCN5 was able to pull down detectable amounts of SF-1. Nontransfected COS-1 cells were immunoprecipitated as above, in which no SF-1 band is detected. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous GCN5 with hGCN5 antibodies is shown in Fig. 3E. The effect of the HAT proteins GCN5 and CBP on SF-1 transactivation was analyzed. COS-1 cells were cotransfected with the reporter plasmid pT81-4CRS2LUC and either the SF-1 plasmid alone or with the GCN5 expression plasmid. The results in Fig. 4A indicate that GCN5 stimulates SF-1 transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of histone deacetylase inhibitor repressed transactivation in the presence of GCN5 (Fig. 4B). Transactivation of SF-1 with CBP expression plasmid is consistent with previous results (Fig.4C). In the presence of CBP, TSA enhanced transactivation of SF-1. To determine the functional consequences of the inhibition of histone deacetylation by TSA in SF-1 transactivation in COS-1 cells, cotransfections were performed with an SF-1 wild-type plasmid and a reporter plasmid pT81-4CRS2LUC. The transfected cells were incubated with TSA at various concentrations for 12 h. After 40 h of transfection, cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity was determined. The results in the Fig. 4D indicate that SF-1 activates the pT81-4CRS2LUC reporter plasmid, and TSA increased SF-1 transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of TSA to the cells transfected with theKGFFK mutant had shown no effect on the reduced transcriptional activity; a further increase in transcriptional activity was observed with the RFQK mutant (data not shown). The expression of SF-1 protein in transfected COS-1 cells, in the presence or absence of TSA, was analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and SF-1 was detected by immunoblotting using polyclonal antibodies specific for SF-1. The addition of TSA resulted in a significant increase of SF-1 protein levels (Fig. 5A). To demonstrate that the increased protein level is the result of stabilization of the SF-1 protein, pulse-chase experiments were done. The half-life of exogenously introduced SF-1 in COS-1 cells was calculated in the presence or absence of TSA. COS-1 cells were transfected with SF-1 expression plasmid and pulse labeled after 24 h of transfection. Radioactive labeled SF-1 protein was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the SF-1 protein. SF-1 protein expression was detected by autoradiography (Fig.5B). In COS-1 cells the amount of SF-1 protein was reduced to 71.4% after 1 h compared with time point zero hour, which was set to 100%. After 3 h the amount of protein measured was 44.8%. The cells treated with TSA, the SF-1 amount of protein in 1 h was 96.7%, and after 3 h it decreased to 65.1%. Increased half-life of SF-1 is observed in the cells treated with TSA (Fig.5C). Because TSA increased SF-1 protein levels we checked the localization of the endogenously expressed SF-1 in Y-1 cells treated with TSA. The addition of TSA to Y-1 cells increases transactivation (not shown). The localization of endogenous SF-1 in Y-1 cells is revealed by immunofluorescence analysis. Nuclear localization of endogenous SF-1 in the steroidogenic mouse MA-10 Leydig cells and in human adrenocortical H295R cells has been shown previously (42Lalli E. Ohe K. Hindelang C. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In Y-1 cells SF-1 is localized in the nucleus (Fig. 6). After treatment with TSA, both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of SF-1 is observed in Y-1 cells. The same distribution was found in COS-1 cells transfected with an SF-1 expression plasmid (not shown). By using confocal microscopy, punctuated appearance of SF-1 in the cytoplasm is revealed. To show that the cytoplasmic localization of SF-1 is a consequence of inhibition of deacetylation, Y-1 cells were treated with forskolin, which stimulates adenylyl cyclase in different cell types. Even though forskolin increased SF-1 transactivation in Y-1 cells (35Bakke M. Lund J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 327-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the addition of forskolin did not affect the nuclear localization. The recruitment of coactivators and corepressors at the target gene promoter is an important process during transactivation by nuclear receptors (25Westin S. Kurokawa R. Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B.

Acetylation of transcription factors modulates levels of transactivation, protein stability, protein-protein interactions, and DNA recognition (28Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that SF-1 is acetylated in vivo. The acetylation of mutant SF-1 proteins might be caused by multiple lysines being acetylated in vivo by different HAT enzymes. In p53, the lysines were acetylated by CBP, and p300/CBP-associated factor are different (31Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar, 41Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Among the mammalian nuclear cofactors with HAT activity, human GCN5 has been well characterized (44Wang L. Mizzen C. Ying C. Candau R. Barlev N. Brownell J. Allis C.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The GCN5 HAT enzyme is a part of a multimeric complex with the other components, such as ADA2, which are necessary for its activity (45Candau R. Zhou J.X. Allis C.D. Berger S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 46Syntichaki P. Thireos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24414-24419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The use of immunoprecipitated GCN5 for acetylation experiments provides the additional components important for acetylation. In vitro acetylation of SF-1 by GCN5 shows that GCN5 can be one of the potential enzymes involved in acetylationin vivo. Hypoacetylation of mutants of SF-1 by GCN5 further proves that the lysine motifs C-terminal to the zinc finger domains are the targets of acetylation. In vitro acetylation of SF-1 by GCN5 led us to analyze the consequences of acetylation in vivo. Overexpression of GCN5 increased the transcriptional activity of SF-1. Enhanced transcriptional activity by coactivator GCN5 is consistent with acetylation being a necessary modification used in SF-1 transactivation. Several acetylation-regulated protein-protein interactions have been reported recently. For example, activator of thyroid and retinoic acid receptor association with nuclear receptors is inhibited by acetylation (28Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Enhanced protein interactions as a result of acetylation are shown in transcription factors c-Myb and HNF-4 for CBP (47Sano Y. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3674-3682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 48Soutoglou E. Katrakili N. Talianidis I. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 745-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In the present study recruitment of SF-1 by GCN5 demonstrates in vivo interaction of SF-1 with GCN5. This association of acetylated SF-1 with this HAT protein suggests direct modification of SF-1 by GCN5 in vivo and might be important for the ultimate recruitment of other proteins to the transcriptional complex. Mutations of the lysine residues C-terminal to the zinc finger domains also affect transactivation. These lysines might be necessary for regulation of the SF-1 activity. Histone deacetylases are involved in transcriptional regulation by deacetylation of histones (49Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar, 50Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) and transcription factors (51Luo J. Su F. Chen D. Shiloh A. Gu W. Nature. 2000; 408: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Histone deacetylase enzyme activities are inhibited by TSA through direct interaction of TSA with histone deacetylases (52Furumai R. Komatsu Y. Nishino N. Khochbin S. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 53Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Breslow R. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). TSA increases the acetylation level and transcriptional activity in p53 (51Luo J. Su F. Chen D. Shiloh A. Gu W. Nature. 2000; 408: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The addition of TSA enhanced SF-1-mediated transactivation. Another consequence of the TSA treatment of cells is an increased expression level of SF-1 and its half-life. The mechanism of protection from degradation by inhibition of deacetylation is unknown. Pulse-chase analyses of SF-1 reveal that its turnover is strikingly rapid. Rapid degradation might be necessary for modulating the transcriptional activity of steroid receptors. In glucocorticoid receptors, rapid exchange of the receptor bound to chromatin in the presence of hormones has been demonstrated recently by using photobleaching techniques (54McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Continuous exchange of the receptors bound to chromatin takes place even in the presence of hormones or ligands in the cells. Rapid exchange of the receptors might increase the availability of receptors for modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation. Histone deacetylase inhibitors are potent antitumor agents, involved in induction of cell differentiation and apoptosis (55Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 56Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1210-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Addition of the deacetylation inhibitor TSA led to cytoplasmic localization of SF-1 protein in Y-1 cells. The punctuate clustering appearance of SF-1 in the cytoplasm might be that SF-1 is localized to organelles or associated with other structures in the cytoplasm. Recent reports suggest that cellular localization affects ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of proteins. Components involved in ubiquitin-mediated degradation are not distributed evenly inside the cell (57Lenk U. Sommer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39403-39410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The active transport of SF-1 protein into the cytoplasm might be the reason for the increased half-life of SF-1 in the presence of TSA.

The complex consists of a major vault protein (MVP), two minor vault proteins (VPARP and TEP1), and several small untranslated RNA molecules.

Fifteen years ago, vaults were first observed in preparations of clathrin-coated vesicles from rat liver as unusual ovoid particles that displayed highly regular dimensions possessing a complex barrel-shaped morphology. The structures were named “vaults,” a term that describes the morphology of the particles, which contain multiple arches reminiscent of vaulted ceilings in cathedrals. Since then, vaults of nearly identical size and morphology have been reported to occur in phylogenetic groups as diverse as mammals, avians, amphibians, slime molds, echinoderms, mollusks, and protozoa. The mammalian vault particle consists of multiple copies of a 100-kDa major vault protein (MVP1), the minor vault proteins of 193 and 240 kDa, and small untranslated RNA molecules of 88–141 bases. The precise cellular function(s) of the vault complex are not yet completely clear (for reviews see Refs. 1Rome L. Kedersha N. Chugani D.

However, there are reports that describe vaults to be associated with the nucleus (4Abbondanza C. Rossi V. Roscigno A. Gallo L. Belsito A. Piluso G. Medici N. Nigro V. Molinari A.M. Moncharmont B.

In addition, other lines of evidence suggest that vaults may function in intracellular detoxification processes and as a consequence function in multidrug resistance (MDR). Expression of MVP reflects the chemoresistance profile of many tumor cell lines and untreated cancers (3Scheffer G.L. Schroeijers A.B. Izquierdo M.A. Wiemer E.A. Scheper R.J. Curr. Opin.

Furthermore, it was shown in several MDR cell lines that not only MVP was up-regulated but other vault components as well (13Kickhoefer V.A. Rajavel K.S. Scheffer G.L. Dalton W.S. Scheper R.J.

The most compelling data that link vaults to MDR comes from Kitazono et al. (15Kitazono M. Sumizawa T. Takebayashi Y. Chen Z.S. Furukawa T. Nagayama S. Tani A. Takao S. Aikou T. Akiyama S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1647-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Kitazono M. Okumura H. Ikeda R. Sumizawa T. Furukawa T. Nagayama S. Seto K. Aikou T. Akiyama S. Int. J.

In this setting it was demonstrated that the reduction of MVP expression reverses the drug-resistant phenotype of the sodium butyrate-treated cells. It is still unclear by which molecular mechanism vaults function in MDR. However, the experiments by Kitazonoet al. suggest that vaults play a role in MDR by blocking or preventing the accumulation of the anthracycline doxorubicin in the nucleus. The mammalian vault complex is assembled into a typical hollow barrel-like structure with an 8-2-2 symmetry. It has an invaginated waist and two protruding caps, which most likely consist of the minor vault proteins and the vault RNA (17Kedersha N.L. Heuser J.E. Chugani D.C. Rome L.H. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The major vault protein is believed to be the main structural determinant of the complex, comprising 70% of its molecular mass. Each vault particle is composed of 96 MVP molecules, 8 molecules of p193, 2 molecules of p240, and at least 6 molecules of vault RNA. The p193 subunit contains a distinct domain with similarity to the catalytic domain of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). It was subsequently demonstrated that p193 catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of itself and MVP (21Kickhoefer V.A. Siva A.C. Kedersha N.L. Inman E.M. Ruland C. Streuli M. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). No other substrates for p193 have been described so far. Because of the PARP activity of p193 it was renamed vault PARP (VPARP). The p240 subunit was found to be identical to a previously described component of the telomerase complex, the telomerase-associated protein 1 (TEP1) (22Kickhoefer V.A. Stephen A.G. Harrington L.

The precise role of this subunit within the telomerase complex is not yet clear except that it is able to bind telomerase RNA. In a three-hybrid system TEP1 was shown to associate with vault RNA (22Kickhoefer V.A. Stephen A.G. Harrington L. Robinson M.O. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32712-32717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently it was found that TEP1 is required for a stable association of the vault RNA with the vault complex (20Kickhoefer V.A. Liu Y. Kong L.B. Snow B.E. Stewart P.L. Harrington L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The role of the vault RNA is still an enigma. However, based on experiments in which degradation of the vault RNA by RNase treatment did not lead to morphological changes, the vault RNA is more likely to be a functional rather than a structural component (17Kedersha N.L. Heuser J.E. Chugani D.C. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Kong L.B. Siva A.C. Kickhoefer V.A. Rome L.H. Stewart P.L. RNA (N.

Immunoblotting experiments were performed with the rabbit polyclonal anti-MVP and the mouse monoclonal anti-p193 (mAb p193-4) (14Schroeijers A.B. Siva A.C. Scheffer G.L. de Jong M.C. Bolick S.C. Dukers D.F. Slootstra J.W. Meloen R.H. Wiemer E. Kickhoefer V.A. Rome L.H. Scheper R.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1104-1110PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin was purchased from the Sigma-Aldrich Corp. (St. Louis, MO). Species-specific anti-Ig antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. (West Grove, PA). In immunoprecipitation experiments the rabbit polyclonal anti-MVP and the mouse monoclonal anti-MVP (LRP-56; Monosan, Uden, The Netherlands) were used. The preimmune serum and the isotypic IgG2b were used as controls in these experiments. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE after which the size-fractionated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. By incubating the membranes in TBST (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) the remaining protein binding sites were saturated. Subsequently the membranes were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies diluted in the same buffer. Immune-complexes were detected using the BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate (POD) kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) and visualized on Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). RNA was isolated from freshly harvested cell pellets. The isolation was performed using RNAzol B according to recommendations from the manufacturer (Campro Scientific, Veenendaal, The Netherlands). About 15 μg of total RNA was dissolved in RNA loading buffer (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA, 90% (v/v) formamide). RNA samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% poly-acrylamide gel containing 8m urea. The separated RNA was transferred to a Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using a semi-dry blotting method. In brief: RNAs were electroblotted at 10 V for 15 min followed by 30 V for 30 min in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mmEDTA). Afterward the membrane was cross-linked by UV (Bio-Rad GS gene linker) and prehybridized in Church buffer (30Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar) at 55 °C for at least 2 h. The following oligonucleotide probes were used: HVG1, 5′-GCTTGTTTCAATTAAAGAACTGTCG; HVG2, 5′-AGGTGGTTACAATGTACTCGAAG; HVG3, 5′-GAGGTGGTTTGATGACACGCGAAG; and HVG4, 5′-CCTAACCATGGAAAGCATTGTCG. Alternatively, a universal probe (5′- GCCCGCGGGTYTCGAAC) was used, encompassing a region shared by all human vault RNAs. The probes were end-labeled with [γ32P]dATP. Hybridizations were performed at 55 °C in Church buffer for 3–4 h. Subsequently, the membranes were washed twice at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS (20 × SSC: 3 m sodium chloride, 0.3 mtrisodium citrate dihydrate, pH 8) and once in 5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min at 55 °C. Blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) at −80 °C or exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) for quantitation. Afterward the blots were stripped and reprobed with a 5 S rRNA-specific oligonucleotide (5′-TCTCCCATCCAAGTACTAACCAGGCC) as a control for equal loading. Putative human vault RNA genes were cloned by PCR using two primers, based on conserved regions in the rat and bullfrog vault RNA sequences (31Kickhoefer V.A. Searles R.P. Kedersha N.L. Garber M.E. Johnson D.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7868-7873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The forward primer was 5′-AGCTCAGCGGTTACTTC and the reverse primer was 5′-GCCCGCGGGTYTCGAAC. As template we used 300 ng of human genomic DNA. The PCR was performed with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the following conditions: 95 °C for 4 min, then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min followed by 72 °C for 8 min. The product of ∼100 bp was excised from an agarose gel, cloned into pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and analyzed by sequencing. The plasmids formed (pCR-HVG1, pCR-HVG2, pCR-HVG3, and pCR-HVG4) were used as a control for the specificity of the probes. An IgG fraction of rabbit polyclonal anti-MVP was coupled to Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Immunoprecipitations were carried out for 2–14 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) supplemented with proteinase inhibitors mixture (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 0.1 unit/μl RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI). Subsequently, the beads were washed two times with lysis buffer and three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100. The beads were suspended in 0.5 ml of RNAzol B (Campro Scientific) for RNA isolation or in protein sample buffer for Western analysis. When RNA was used for RT-PCR, the immunoprecipitated vaults were treated with DNase I (RNase-free) prior to the addition of RNAzol. After treatment RNAzol B was added and RNA could be isolated. By using random hexamers, cDNA was generated in a reverse transcriptase reaction using Superscript RT (Life Technologies Inc.). On the generated cDNA, a PCR reaction using Taqpolymerase (Promega) was performed with the universal primers described above. The RT-PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon transfer membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were cross-linked by UV light and hybridized as described above (Northern analysis). Mouse monoclonal anti-MVP (LRP-56) was coupled to Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The immunoprecipitations were carried out for 2 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 75 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) supplemented with proteinase inhibitors mixture (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 0.1 unit/μl RNasin (Promega). The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and RNAzol B was added to the beads. The supernatant of the first immunoprecipitation was used for a second immunoprecipitation using the same conditions. The beads of the second immunoprecipitation were also dissolved in RNAzol B after the wash steps. RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer (Campro Scientific). RNA of the two immunoprecipitations of the same cell line were pooled, separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 8m urea, semi-dry blotted, and detected as described before. To screen the human genome for genes encoding putative vault RNAs, a PCR was performed using primers based on the conserved parts of the rat and bullfrog vault RNA. The amplified fragments of ∼100 bp were cloned and analyzed by sequencing. The analysis of 27 independent clones revealed the four previously described vault RNA genes (HVG1–4). No additional genes encoding vault RNAs were found. A BLAST search showed that HVG1–3 are arranged in a triple repeat structure on chromosome 5q33.1 (BAC clone 119j3 (LBNL H175)) and HVG4 is localized on chromosome Xp11.2 (PAC 339A18). The sequences spacing the HVGs on chromosome 5, about 7600 bp between HVG1 and HVG2 and 7200 bp between HVG2 and HVG3, do not encode any open reading frames. The alignment of the four detected hvg species (Fig. 1A) clearly shows two conserved stretches at both ends, which contain polymerase III internal promoter elements (A and B boxes). In between these conserved regions there is a part of variable length with no significant homologous stretches. Notably, the HVG1 gene contains a small duplication of 47 bp after the stop codon (TTTT). This repeat includes a second B box and ends with a genuine stop. This larger fragment was also amplified by PCR on genomic DNA with the universal primers, whereas a PCR performed on cDNA prepared from human mononuclear cells isolated from bone marrow did not give rise to this larger HVG1 fragment implying it is not expressed (data not shown). Although the stop codon of HVG3 is mutated to TCTT, it seems to be functional, because an HVG3 expression product of the right size (88 bases) could be detected. Comparison of upstream sequences of HVG1–4 revealed a high degree of similarity between HVG1, 2, and3. Several external polymerase III promoter elements could be identified: a TATA box at position −20, a proximal sequence element at position −70, and two distal sequence elements at −340 and −440 (Fig. 1B). The upstream sequence of HVG4 was totally different and did not contain any recognizable external promoter elements. The TATA box of HVG3 is different from the other HVGs, TACAAT instead of TATAAT. The major vault protein is expressed in all cell lines examined, although expression levels vary considerably (Fig.2). Low levels were found in the breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7 and the embryonal kidney cell line 293. MVP could only be detected in these cell lines if vaults were concentrated by immunoprecipitation (data not shown). MVP is overexpressed in a number of drug-resistant cancer cell lines such as the SW1573/2R120 and GLC4/ADR in which the drug resistance is not mediated by P-glycoprotein (10Scheper R.J. Broxterman H.J. Scheffer G.L. Kaaijk P. Dalton W.S. van Heijningen T.H. van Kalken C.K. Slovak M.L. de Vries E.G. van der Valk P. et al.Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1475-1479PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kickhoefer V.A. Rajavel K.S. Scheffer G.L. Dalton W.S. Scheper R.J. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In general a 2- to 5-fold increase in MVP levels is detected by Western analysis in the resistant cell lines. Usually the difference in MVP levels between GLC4 and GLC4/ADR is more pronounced than the difference observed in the SW1573 and SW1573/2R120 combination. The reason why vault levels vary is not exactly clear and may be influenced by culture conditions. Interestingly, vaults are also overexpressed in the P-glycoprotein expressing resistant cell lines 8226 D40 and KB8. Generally, the expression levels of VPARP (p193) closely follow the MVP levels as would be expected, because they are both components of the same complex. However, this is not the case in the 8226 S and 8226 D40 cell lines. Northern analysis was used to determine the expression levels of the four vault RNA species. Individual vault RNAs were detected by oligonucleotide probes (see Fig. 1A) that hybridize exclusively to specific vault RNAs. A universal probe, corresponding to the reverse primer, hybridizes to the conserved box B element that is present in all vault RNAs (Fig.3A). Identical Northern blots were hybridized with these probes and with a 5 S rRNA probe as a control for equal loading. There is expression of hvg1, 2, and 3 in all cell lines examined (Fig. 3B). Longer exposure times revealed low levels of hvg2 and hvg3 in the GLC4 and GLC4/ADR cells and hvg3 in the 8226 S and 8226 D40 cells. Note that two hybridizing bands were observed with the HVG3 probe. The RNAs migrate so close together in the gel system that they cannot differ more than a few bases in length. It is not clear whether these RNAs represent two true variants of hvg3 or whether they are the result of degradation during the procedure. hvg4 was not detected in any of the cell lines. Hybridization of a Northern blot with the universal probe verified the results and showed two bands in most lanes. The top band corresponded to hvg1 of 98 bases and the lower band to the co-migrating hvg2 and 3, both 88 bases in length. Quantification of the signal in each lane and calculation of the ratio hvg1 versus hvg2/3 showed that the expression ratio is cell line-dependent, the ratio being more or less equal in HeLa and the SW1573 and 8226 S cells. A slightly increased ratio was detected in the respective resistant derivatives, indicating a higher expression level of hvg1. The KB series and the L88/5 cells contained approximately twice as much hvg1 as hvg2/3, whereas the SW620, MCF7, and in particular 293 expressed more hvg2/3 than hvg1. To check if the hvg species are present in a non-vault-associated fraction, we performed three consecutive immunoprecipitations with rabbit polyclonal anti-MVP bound to Protein A-Sepharose beads. On a Western blot equal portions of the precipitated proteins (1, 2, and 3) and the remaining supernatant (S) were loaded (Fig.4A). No residual MVP signal could be detected in the supernatant, indicating that it was cleared from vault particles. From the same samples RNA was isolated that was converted to cDNA and used in a PCR with a primer set capable of amplifying all vault RNA species. Equal portions of the PCR product were loaded onto an agarose gel, which was stained with ethidium bromide (Fig. 4B). The signal of the amplified vault RNAs decreased with each immunoprecipitation, which is clearly visible in the case of the GLC4 and GLC4/ADR cells. However, in all cell lines there was a strong signal in the supernatant fraction (S), indicating the presence of a pool of vault RNA. Southern analysis on the S fractions revealed that in all cases the pool consists of hvg1, 2, and 3 (only S fraction of GLC4/ADR is shown). When all vault RNA species have the same affinity for the vault complex, one would expect the expression ratio of hvg1–3 to be similar to the ratio found associated with the vault complex. Therefore, we isolated RNA from immunoprecipitated vaults and determined the levels of the hvg species by Northern analysis using the universal probe (Fig. 5). In several parental cell lines we found that the bulk of the associated vault RNA is hvg1. On average, 50% of the expressed vault RNA is hvg1, however, about 80% of the vault RNA found bound to the vault complex is hvg1 (Table I). Clearly the hvg expression ratio does not reflect the ratio in which hvgs are associated with the complex.Table IPercent hvg1 expressed versus percent hvg1 bound to vaultsCell linehvg1 expressedhvg1 associated%SW157348678226 S4790KB 3–16781Represented are the percentage of hvg1 that is expressed and the percentage of hvg1 that is associated to vaults in three parental cell lines.

https://openalex.org/W1980275980,"Recently, a cyanobacteriumSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has been shown to contain an Na+/H+ antiporter gene homologous to plants (SOS1 and AtNHX1 from Arabidopsis) and mammalians (NHEs from human) but not toEscherichia coli (nhaA and nhaB). Here, we examined whether a halotolerant cyanobacteriumAphanothece halophytica has homologous genes. It turned out that A. halophytica contains an Na+/H+ antiporter homologous to plants, mammalians, and some bacteria (nhaP fromPseudomonas and synnhaP fromSynechocystis) but with novel ion specificity. Its gene product, ApNhaP (Na+/H+ antiporter fromAphanothece halophytica), exhibited the Na+/H+ antiporter activity over a wide pH range between 5 and 9 and complemented the Na+-sensitive phenotype of the antiporter-deficient E. coli mutant. The ApNhaP had virtually no activity for the Li+/H+ antiporter but showed high Ca2+/H+ antiporter activity at alkaline pH. The ApNhaP complemented the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype of theE. coli mutant but not the Li+-sensitive phenotype. The replacement of a long C-terminal tail of ApNhaP with that of Synechocystis altered the ion specificity of the antiporter. These results suggest that the ion specificity of an Na+/H+ antiporter is partly determined by the structural properties of the C-terminal tail, which was well exemplified in the case of A. halophytica.

The homology between E. coli antiporters and eukaryotic ones was very low, suggesting the independent evolution among Na+/H+ antiporter genes. In a previous study (9Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we showed that a cyanobacteriumSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 contains an Na+/H+ antiporter, SynNhaP,1 homologous to eukaryotic and prokaryotic (NhaP from Pseudomonas aeruginosa) ones but not to the NhaA, NhaB, and ChaA. It was also shown that the SynNhaP contains a conserved Asp138in the transmembrane (TM)-spanning region and a relatively long C-terminal hydrophilic tail, which are important for the carrier activity. The long C-terminal tails are believed to play a role in the regulation of transport activity in animals (2Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

These facts suggest that the cyanobacterial antiporters would provide a model system for the study of the structural and functional properties of eukaryotic Na+/H+ antiporters. To date, only a few functional residues, especially the residues involved in the cation transport, have been identified in Na+/H+ antiporter proteins. The importance of Asp138 in SynNhaP (9Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and Asp133, Asp163, and Asp164 in NhaA (11Inoue H. Noumi T. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H.

Acta. 1995; 1230: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) has been reported. The Na+/H+ antiporter has been thought to exchange specifically between H+ and Na+ or Li+, but some antiporters exhibited low exchange activity between H+ and Li+ (13Utsugi J. Inaba K. Kuroda T. Tsuda M. Tsuchiya T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). TheE. coli ChaA has been reported to have an exchange activity between Ca2+ and H+ as well as Na+and H+ at alkaline pH (14Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Pinner E. Karpel R. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Krulwich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 11296-11303Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), but this has not been examined in detail. It is not clear by which factors ion specificity is determined. To identify the conserved sequences for the cation transport in Na+/H+ antiporters, the cloning of an antiporter with novel ion specificity is a prerequisite. Aphanothece halophytica is a halotolerant cyanobacterium that can grow in a wide range of salinity conditions from 0.25 to 3.0m NaCl (15Ishitani M. Takabe T. Kojima K. Takabe T. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 20: 693-703Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Takabe T. Incharoensakdi A. Arakawa K. Yokota S. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A. halophytica accumulates an osmoprotectant glycine betaine at high salinity (15Ishitani M. Takabe T. Kojima K. Takabe T. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 20: 693-703Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The DnaK protein of A. halophytica has been shown to contain a longer C-terminal segment than other DnaK/Hsp70 family members (17Lee B.H. Hibino T. Jo J. Viale A.M. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 763-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and exhibit extremely high protein folding activity at high salinity (18Hibino T. Kaku N. Yoshikawa H. Takabe T. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Transformation of tobacco with the DnaK from A. halophytica was shown to enhance the tolerance for salt (19Sugino M. Hibino T. Tanaka Y. Nii N. Takabe T. Takabe T. Plant Sci. (Shannon). 1999; 137: 81-88Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to examine whether A. halophytica contains a unique Na+/H+antiporter. Here, we isolated an Na+/H+antiporter gene, homologous to eukaryotic ones but with novel ion specificity. It was also shown that the ion specificity was affected by the C-terminal tail. A. halophyticacells were grown photoautotrophically in BG11 medium plus 18 mmNaNO3 and Turk Island salt solution as described previously (15Ishitani M. Takabe T. Kojima K. Takabe T. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 20: 693-703Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Takabe T. Incharoensakdi A. Arakawa K. Yokota S. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lee B.H.

Biol. 1997; 35: 763-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) except that the NaCl concentration of the culture medium was adjusted to a range from 0.25 to 2.5 m as desired. Cotton-plugged 500-ml conical flasks containing 200 ml of medium each were used and shaken on a reciprocal shaker without supplementation of condensed CO2 gas. The culture flasks were incubated at 28 °C under continuous fluorescent white light (30 microeinsteins m−2 s−1). A. halophytica genomic DNA was isolated as described (17Lee B.H. Hibino T. Jo J. Viale A.M. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 763-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Partially degenerate oligonucleotides were designed based on two highly conserved polypeptide regions among several Na+/H+ antiporters (9Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The forward primer, NP-F, was designed after the polypeptide stretch Phe-Leu-Pro-Pro-Leu-Leu-Phe-Glu-Ala (residues 73 to 81 in SynNhaP). The reverse primer, NP-R, contains the complementary sequence corresponding to the stretch Glu-Gly-Glu-Ser-Leu-Phe-Asn-Asp-Gly (residues 160 to 168 in SynNhaP). The sequences of all the primers are shown in Fig.1A. Amplified DNA fragments of an expected size (∼0.3 kilobase pairs) were obtained and sequenced. Using the determined nucleotide sequence, the adjacent unknown regions of DNA were amplified by the inverse polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method (20Triglia T. Peterson M.G. Kemp D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 25: 8186Crossref Scopus (725) Google Scholar). For this, DNA fragments obtained by partial digestion with Sau3AI or complete digestion withEcoRI or AseI were size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragments from 1–5 kilobase pairs were self-ligated using a ligation kit (Takara Shuzo Co., Shiga, Japan), and then the specific DNA fragment was amplified and sequenced. By repeating this, the nucleotide sequence of about 2.4 kilobase pairs, which covers the whole sequence of the Na+/H+antiporter gene (apnhaP) of A. halophytica, was determined. The DNA sequence was determined using an ABI310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and analyzed with the DNASIS program (Hitachi Software Engineering, Kanagawa, Japan). The coding region ofapnhaP was isolated by the PCR reaction. The forward primer, ANP-NcoI, contains the start codon ATG and NcoI site. The reverse primer, ANP-HindIII, contains theHindIII restriction site. The amplified fragment was ligated into NcoI/HindIII sites of the pTrcHis2C plasmid. The resulting plasmid, pANhaP, encodes the ApNhaP fused in-frame to six histidines and was transferred first to E. coli DH5α cells and then to TO114 cells in which nhaA, nhaB, andchaA genes were deleted (21Ohyama T. Igarashi K. Kobayashi H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 176: 4311-4315Crossref Google Scholar). A chimeric gene that encodes the TM region of ApNhaP (residues Met1–Ile401) and the C-terminal cytosolic region of SynNhaP (residues Gln401–Ser527) was constructed as follows (Fig. 1). The nucleotides corresponding to the TM region of ApNhaP and C-terminal region of SynNhaP were amplified by the forward/reverse primer sets, ANP-NcoI/ANP-N-R and SNP-C-F/SNP-C-R, respectively. The template for the former nucleotide was the pANhaP, and that for the latter was the pSNhaP in which thesynnhaP gene was ligated into theNcoI/EcoRI site of pTrcHis2C (9Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The forward primer, SNP-C-F, contains the sequence corresponding to the polypeptide stretches Gln398-Thr-Val-Ile401 of ApNhaP and Gln401-Phe-Val-Leu404 of SynNhaP, and the reverse primer, ANP-N-R, is the complementary sequence of SNP-C-F. The reverse primer, SNP-C-R, contains the EcoRI site just before the stop codon of pSNhaP. Upon mixing both PCR products, a chimeric gene apsynnhaP was amplified using the forward ANP-NcoI and reverse SNP-C-R primers and ligated into theNcoI/EcoRI-digested sites of pTrcHis2C, which generated the plasmid pASNhaP. For the construction of a chimeric gene that encodes the TM region of SynNhaP (residues Met1–Thr400) and the C-terminal region of ApNhaP (residues Glu402–Glu521), the respective nucleotides were amplified by the following forward/reverse primer sets, SNP-N-F/SNP-N-R and ANP-C-F/ANP-HindIII. Here, the reverse primer, SNP-N-R, is the complementary sequence of ANP-C-F. Upon mixing both PCR products, a chimeric gene synapnhaP was amplified using the forward SNP-N-F and reverse ANP-HindIII primers and ligated into theNcoI/HindIII-digested sites of pTrcHis2C, which generated the plasmid pSANhaP. The Na+/H+ antiporter activity was examined on everted membrane vesicles prepared from the cells grown in LBK medium (Luria broth with KCl instead of NaCl) as described (9Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Rosen B.P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and then washed with a suspension buffer TCDS (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.14 m choline chloride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25 m sucrose). The pellet was suspended in 10 ml of TCDS buffer and applied to a French pressure cell (4,000 p.s.i.). Then, the solution was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 110,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was suspended in 600 μl of TCDS buffer. The antiporter activity was estimated from the changes of ΔpH (transmembrane pH gradient) by the addition of salt to the reaction mixture, which contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (titrated with HCl to the indicated pH), 5 mmMgCl2, 0.14 m choline chloride, 1 μm acridine orange, and membrane vesicles (50 μg of protein) in a volume of 2 ml. The ΔpH was monitored with acridine orange fluorescence, which was obtained by excitation at 492 nm and emission at 525 nm. Before the addition of salt, Tris-dl-lactate (2 mm) was added to initiate fluorescence quenching (Q) due to respiration. Lactate energizes the vesicle and accumulates H+ intravesiculary, which causes the accumulation of dye and fluorescence quenching (Q). Upon the addition of salt (5 mm), fluorescence increases because of the excretion of H+ by antiporters and dequenched fluorescence (ΔQ) were monitored. Then, NH4Cl (25 mm) was added to dissipate ΔpH. The hydropathy profile of the deduced amino acid sequence was predicted according to the method of Kyte and Doolittle (23Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar). The possible TMs of the ApNhaP sequence was deduced by a computer program TopPredII (24Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 331-337PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (17Lee B.H. Hibino T. Jo J. Viale A.M. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 763-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An antibody raised against 6× histidine (His6 tag) was obtained from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Using the mixed oligonucleotides of two highly conserved regions among several NhaP-type antiporters, a fragment of the Na+/H+ antiporter gene was amplified and sequenced. Then, the upstream and downstream regions of the fragment were amplified by the inverse PCR method (20Triglia T. Peterson M.G. Kemp D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 25: 8186Crossref Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the entire 2431 bp was determined (Fig.2A). The sequence analysis revealed one possible open reading frame, apnhaP, spanning positions 796 to 2361. The predicted gene product consists of 521 amino acids with a molecular mass of 56,881 Da (ApNhaP). The upstream sequence of the first Met revealed the presence of −10 (ATGAAT) and −35 (TACACT) consensus sequences (Fig. 2B). At further upstream region-spanning positions 185 to 676, another open reading frame encoding a low potential cytochrome cassociated with the photosystem II (cytochromec550) was found. The amino acid sequence of cytochrome c550 deduced from the nucleotide sequence showed high homology to those from cyanobacteria, algae, and plants (data not shown). The homology search revealed that ApNhaP is highly homologous to the Na+/H+ antiporters from eukaryotes (SOS1, NHEs, AtNHX1, and NHX1) and prokaryotes (NhaP, SynNhaP, and SynNhaP2) as shown in Fig. 3. Here, SynNhaP2 is the second NhaP-type antiporter found in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (9Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). ApNhaP showed the highest homology to SynNhaP (∼61% identity in amino acids). Analysis of the hydropathy plot (23Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) and the TM prediction program (24Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 331-337PubMed Google Scholar) predicted 11 putative TM segments in ApNhaP (Fig. 3A). The Asp139 in ApNhaP was the conserved ionic amino acid in the membrane-spanning region whose importance for the exchange activity has been shown by the mutagenesis analysis of SynNhaP (9Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The ApNhaP contained a long hydrophilic C-terminal tail, which is the case in eukaryotic Na+/H+ antiporters but not in the NhaP fromP. aeruginosa. These data indicate that a halotolerant cyanobacterium A. halophytica contains an Na+/H+ antiporter homologous to eukaryotic ones. To characterize the molecular properties of ApNhaP, theapnhaP gene was ligated into the pTrcHis2C plasmid. The resulting plasmid, pANhaP, as well as pSNhaP, was expressed in theE. coli host cells (TO114) in which NhaA, NhaB, and ChaA were absent (9Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Ohyama T. Igarashi K. Kobayashi H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 176: 4311-4315Crossref Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis of the membrane fractions revealed that the E. coli cells transformed with pANhaP and pSNhaP exhibited a single cross-reaction band corresponding to ∼53 kDa, whereas the E. coli cells transformed with the vector alone (pTrcHis2C) did not show any band (data not shown). These results indicate that the ApNhaP could be expressed and assembled in E. coli membranes. Fig. 4A shows that theE. coli TO114 cells transformed with pANhaP can grow with a similar rate to that of the TO114 cells transformed with pTrcHis2C and pSNhaP in LBK medium at pH 7.0 and 37 °C. However, because of the absence of Na+/H+ antiporter genes (nhaA, nhaB, and chaA) in TO114 cells, the E. coli cells transformed with pTrcHis2C could not grow in the presence of 0.2 m NaCl (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the E. coli cells transformed with pANhaP or pSNhaP could grow (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the TO114 cells transformed with pANhaP grow slightly faster than those transformed with pSNhaP (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4B suggests the different complementation ability between ApNhaP and SynNhaP. Thus, we examined other conditions that cause more clear differences in the complementation ability in these two antiporters. Fig. 5A shows that at the growth temperature of 30 °C, the TO114 cells transformed with pANhaP could grow slightly faster than those transformed with pSNhaP at alkaline pH in LBK medium. Under these conditions, ApNhaP could complement the salt-sensitive phenotype of TO114 cells when the growth medium contained 0.2 m NaCl, whereas SynNhaP could not (Fig. 5B). TO114 cells transformed with pANhaP could even grow in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl (Fig.5C). These differences in complementation ability were not observed at lower pH values (data not shown). The above results indicate that ApNhaP could complement more efficiently than SynNhaP at alkaline pH. To examine directly the antiporter activity of ApNhaP, the everted membrane vesicles were prepared, and their antiporter activities were monitored by measuring the lactate-induced fluorescence quenching (Q) and salt-induced fluorescence dequenching (ΔQ). As shown in the upper panel of Fig.6, the dequenching (ΔQ x100/Q) was observed upon the addition of NaCl in the ApNhaP-expressing cells but not in the control (pTrcHis2C) cells, indicating that ApNhaP has Na+/H+ antiporter activity. Fig. 6Ashows that the dequenching of fluorescence by ApNhaP was observed over a wide pH range between 5 and 9, which is similar to dequenching by SynNhaP (9Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) but quite different from that by E. coliNhaA. In E. coli NhaA, the antiporter activity could not be observed below pH 7.5, whereas the activity increased with increasing pH (1Padan E. Schuldiner S. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. 2. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1996: 501-531Google Scholar). To examine the ion specificity of ApNhaP, the dequenching was measured upon the addition of different cations. In contrast with most Na+/H+ antiporters, which could catalyze the exchange between Li+ and H+, ApNhaP showed virtually no activity of the Li+/H+ antiporter at various pH values (Fig. 6B). Moreover, it was found that ApNhaP could exhibit Ca2+ antiporter activity at neutral or alkaline pH (Fig. 6C), whereas only small or no antiporter activity was observed for K+/H+ or Mg2+/H+, respectively (data not shown). These results indicate that ApNhaP is an antiporter with novel ion specificity. Since the above results indicate that ApNhaP has an exchange activity between Ca2+and H+, but not between Li+ and H+, we further examined whether these ion specificities could be demonstrated in the complementation of salt-sensitive phenotypes ofE. coli mutant cells. As shown in Fig.7A, the TO114 cells expressing ApNhaP could not grow in LBK medium containing 4 mm LiCl at pH 8.0, whereas the TO114 cells expressing SynNhaP could grow. In contrast, Fig. 7B indicates that the TO114 cells expressing ApNhaP could grow well in the TrisE medium containing 0.1m CaCl2 at pH 8.0 (26Brockman R.W. Heppel L.A. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2554-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but the TO114 cells expressing SynNhaP grew slowly. In both cases, the control cells (vector only) could not grow (Fig. 7, A and B). These results are consistent with the results of the Li+/H+ and Ca2+/H+antiporter activities of ApNhaP and SynNhaP (Fig. 6, B andC), although the growth rate of SynNhaP-expressing cells in Ca2+-containing medium appeared to be slower than that anticipated from the Ca2+/H+ exchange activity of SynNhaP (Figs. 7B and 6C). Previously, it was shown that the partial deletion of the C-terminal tail decreased the Na+/H+ antiporter activity of SynNhaP (9Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although ApNhaP showed the highest homology to SynNhaP, the charges on the C-terminal tail of these two antiporters are significantly different, 22 basic and 14 acidic amino acids in ApNhaP and 15 basic and 24 acidic amino acids in SynNhaP. Therefore, we constructed the chimeric antiporters, ASNhaP and SANhaP, in which the long C-terminal tails of ApNhaP and SynNhaP were replaced with those of SynNhaP and ApNhaP, respectively, as shown in Fig.8. The exchange activities of chimeras were measured using the everted membrane vesicles. Fig.9 shows that the ASNhaP chimera exhibited comparable Na+/H+, Li+/H+, and Ca2+/H+exchange activities with those of the parental ApNhaP, which were shown in Fig. 6. Interestingly, the Li+/H+ exchange activity, which was virtually nondetectable in ApNhaP (Fig.6B), could be clearly observed in the ASNhaP chimera (Fig.9B). On the other hand, the SANhaP chimera showed reduced exchange activities of both Na+/H+ and Li+/H+ as compared with the parental SynNhaP (Fig. 9 versus Fig. 6). Furthermore, the Ca2+/H+ exchange activity in the SANhaP chimera appeared to be pH-dependent, i.e. increased activity was observed at neutral or alkaline pH (Fig. 9C), which was in contrast with that observed for the parental SynNhaP, showing relatively unchanged activity irrespective of the pH (Fig.6C). These results suggest that the C-terminal region plays a role for the ion specificity of ApNhaP and SynNhaP, although some activity data do not reconcile with this viewpoint. For example, the SANhaP chimera had low Na+/H+ exchange activity compared with that of ApNhaP and SynNhaP (Figs. 9A and6A), and the Ca2+/H+ exchange activity of ASNhaP chimera was pH-dependent, which is the same as that for the parental ApNhaP but different from that for the SynNhaP (Fig. 9C). These results suggest that the ion specificities of ApNhaP and SynNhaP are also affected by the structures in TM regions, as is assumed in most cases of Na+/H+ antiporters (1Padan E. Schuldiner S. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. 2. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1996: 501-531Google Scholar).Figure 9The activities of chimeric antiporters.The E. coli cells expressing ASNhaP and SANhaP chimeras were grown in LBK medium without the addition of extra salts. From these cells, the everted membrane vesicles were prepared. The antiporter activity was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Each value shows the average of three independent measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The exchange activity data of chimeras were further substantiated by the complementation analysis. As shown in Fig.10, the ASNhaP chimera could complement the Na+-, Li+-, and Ca2+-sensitive phenotypes of the E. coli mutant, whereas the SANhaP chimera could hardly complement the Na+- and Li+-sensitive phenotype of the E. coli mutant. The growth rate of E. coli mutant cells expressing SANhaP was slower than that anticipated from the Ca2+/H+ exchange activity of the SANhaP chimera (Figs. 10C and 9C). We could isolate an Na+/H+ antiporter gene homologous to eukaryotic ones from a halotolerant cyanobacteriumA. halophytica. The A. halophytica antiporter gene exhibits the highest homology to the synnhaP and encodes a polypeptide consisting of 521 amino acids. The hydropathy plot and TM prediction analysis of ApNhaP suggested the presence of 11 TM segments and a relatively long C-terminal tail in cytosolic space. One of the important ionic amino acids, Asp139 in ApNhaP, was conserved in the membrane-spanning region. Based on the findings that the antiporter-deficient E. coliTO114 mutant cells became salt-tolerant by transformation with theapnhaP gene (Fig. 4) and also by the direct observation of Na+/H+ antiporter activity in the transformant membrane vesicles (Fig. 6), it was concluded that the apnhaP encodes the Na+/H+ antiporter ApNhaP. The most striking functional feature of ApNhaP is its novel ion specificity. The ApNhaP did not show the Li+/H+ antiporter activity (Fig. 6B) but did show the Ca2+/H+ antiporter activity (Fig.6C). These conclusions were also substantiated by the observations that the ApNhaP did not complement the Li+-sensitive phenotype of the E. coli mutant (Fig. 7A) but complemented the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype of the E. coli mutant (Fig. 7B). It has been reported that the E. coli ChaA has proton/cation exchange activity with Na+ or Ca2+ but not with Li+ or K+ (14Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Pinner E. Karpel R. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Krulwich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 11296-11303Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 21Ohyama T. Igarashi K. Kobayashi H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 176: 4311-4315Crossref Google Scholar), which is essentially the same ion specificity as that of ApNhaP. However, the ChaA did not show any homology to the ApNhaP. The ChaA has the acidic motif Glu200-His-Glu-Asp-Asp-Ser-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp209conserved in several Ca2+-binding proteins such as calsequestrin, calreticulin, and Na+/Ca2+exchanger (14Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Pinner E. Karpel R. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Krulwich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 11296-11303Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), whereas the ApNhaP lacks the acidic motif. The hydropathy plot of ChaA suggests the absence of a long hydrophilic C-terminal tail seen with the ApNhaP (data not shown). The ApNhaP did not show any homology to the vacuolar Ca2+/H+exchangers from yeast (27Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and plants (28Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Nakanishi Y. Tanaka Y. Maeshima M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All these data suggest that the ApNhaP is an Na+/H+ antiporter with a different structure from that of ChaA. The data of Fig. 9 show that the exchange of long C-terminal tails of ApNhaP and SynNhaP with those of SynNhaP and ApNhaP greatly affected the ion specificity of the antiporter, especially that of the Li+/H+ exchange activity. These data suggest that exchange of the long C-terminal tail could disrupt the structural elements of the antiporter that are critical for ion-specific binding. A remarkable difference between the C-terminal tails of ApNhaP and SynNhaP is the net charges, 22 basic and 14 acidic amino acids in ApNhaP as compared with 15 basic and 24 acidic amino acids in SynNhaP. An intriguing possibility is that the negative charges on the C-terminal tail of SynNhaP help the binding of Li+, which has a smaller ion radius and consequently a higher positive charge density than Na+, on the membrane-spanning region of the antiporter, thereby allowing the Li+/H+exchange activity. However, the data of Ca2+/H+exchange activity between parental and chimeric antiporters (Figs.6C and 9C) do not reconcile with the above viewpoint, suggesting that TM region(s) may also be important for the ion specificity of Na+/H+ antiporters. Since the functional role of the C-terminal domain is relevant to its topology, the topological study on ApNhaP might be interesting. In fact, although the C-terminal domains of Na+/H+antiporters have generally been assumed to be entirely cytosolic, exposure of at least some portion of C-terminal domains to the periplasm has been demonstrated (29Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12391-12396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Wells K.M. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3401-3407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The construction of various mutants with alteration in the C-terminal hydrophilic region of ApNhaP is needed to elucidate the mechanism underlying the ion specificity of ApNhaP. In addition, the construction of additional chimera in whichchaA from E. coli that lacks a C-terminal tail serving as a parental antiporter may give further insight into the role of the C-terminal tail. It is worthwhile to note that there is an apparent disparity of the data between the exchange activity and the growth rate. The difference of growth rates between ApNhaP- and SynNhaP-expressing cells (Fig.7B) was much greater than the difference of Ca2+/H+ antiporter activities between ApNhaP and SynNhaP (Fig. 6C). In the case of the complementation of Ca2+-sensitive E. coli cells (Fig.7B), Ca2+ must be excluded from the cells against the concentration gradient of Ca2+. This activity was much higher in ApNhaP-expressing cells as compared with SynNhaP-expressing cells. In contrast, for Ca2+/H+ exchange, the activity was measured using the everted membrane vesicles subjected to the concentration gradient of Ca2+. The difference in this activity between ApNhaP and SynNhaP was not so high (Fig. 6C). Thus, the experimental conditions are different between the exchange activity measurement and the complementation test, at least on the orientation of vesicles, Ca2+ concentration gradient, and pH at the H+ binding site. These different experimental conditions might be the cause, at least partly, for the apparent disparity between the exchange activity and the growth rate, although the exact nature of this disparity is still unknown. The data of Figs. 4 and 5 show that the complementation ability of ApNhaP is more effective than that of SynNhaP. This finding would suggest an interesting application of ApNhaP for the genetic engineering of salt-tolerant plants. Previously, we showed that the DnaK from A. halophytica exhibits in vitro much higher refolding activity than that of the DnaK from freshwater cyanobacterium (18Hibino T. Kaku N. Yoshikawa H. Takabe T. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The transformation of tobacco plants by A. halophytica DnaK conferred salt tolerance (19Sugino M. Hibino T. Tanaka Y. Nii N. Takabe T. Takabe T. Plant Sci. (Shannon). 1999; 137: 81-88Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) as well as high temperature tolerance (31Ono K. Hibino T. Kohinata T. Suzuki S. Tanaka Y. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Takabe T. Plant Sci. (Shannon). 2001; 160: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since it has been reported that the transformation of Arabidopsis by the vacuole-type Na+/H+ antiporter AtNHX1 fromArabidopsis could confer salt tolerance ofArabidopsis (32Apse M.P. Aharon G.S. Snedden W.A. Blumwald E. Science. 1999; 285: 1256-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar), further studies aimed at constructing the transgenic plants using ApNhaP would enable us to obtain improved salt-tolerant plants. Transfer of multiple salt-tolerant genes fromA. halophytica into plants will provide an interesting example to construct the salt-tolerant plants. In conclusion, we could isolate a eukaryotic Na+/H+ antiporter gene from halotolerant cyanobacterium A. halophytica. ApNhaP exhibited the Na+/H+ antiporter activity over a wide pH range. The ion specificity of ApNhaP is unique. The ApNhaP did not show any activity of the Li+/H+ antiporter but had high Ca2+/H+ antiporter activity. The replacement of a long C-terminal tail of ApNhaP with that ofSynechocystis altered the ion specificity of antiporter. The Na+/H+ antiporter activity was activated by salt shock as well as by an osmoprotectant, betaine. Thus, ApNhaP would provide a unique system for the study of the ion specificity of eukaryotic Na+/H+ antiporters and also an application for the genetic engineering of salt-tolerant plants.

This reaction occurs as a spontaneous intramolecular rearrangement involving a succinimide intermediate in which both carboxyls of Asp are linked to the α-nitrogen of the C-flanking amino acid. During in vitroaging at physiological temperature and pH, isoAsp tends to form most rapidly (though by no means exclusively) at Asn-Gly, Asn-Ser, and Asp-Gly sequences, especially when these sequences occur in short flexible peptides or in flexible domains of proteins (4Aswad D.W.

Methylation of isoAsp-containing peptides in vitro initiates conversion of the atypical β-linkage to a normal α-linkage, suggesting that PIMT may serve a repair function in vivo (8McFadden P.N.

Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the Escherichia coli histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (11Brennan T.V. Anderson J.W. Jia Z. Waygood E.B. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24586-24595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were incubated with PIMT and the methyl donorS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet), significant biological activity was restored. Two independent lines of study demonstrate that PIMT activity is necessary to prevent accumulation of isoAsp in vivo. Our laboratory incubated rat PC12 cells with 10 μm adenosine dialdehyde (AdOx), a methyltransferase inhibitor, for 24 h and found that isoAsp in soluble extracts of treated cells increased to a level 2.5 times that found in control cells (12Johnson B.A. Najbauer J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6174-6181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability was not compromised by AdOx treatment, and isoAsp levels returned to normal within a few hours of transferring the cells back to inhibitor-free medium. More recently, Kim et al. (13Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) generated PIMT-deficient (KO) mice by disrupting the single gene for this enzyme, which exhibits a ubiquitous tissue distribution in rodents. The KO mice died between 28 and 60 days after birth following epileptic seizures. IsoAsp levels in tissue extracts of PIMT (−/−) mice were found to be 5–10 times those found in the (−/+) or (+/+) littermates. Similar results were subsequently reported in an independent study by Yamamotoet al. (14Yamamoto A. Takagi H. Kitamura D. Tatsuoka H. Nakano H. Kawano H. Kuroyanagi H. Yahagi Y. Kobayashi S. Koizumi K. Sakai T. Saito K. Chiba T. Kawamura K. Suzuki K. Watanabe T. Mori H. Shirasawa T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2063-2074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To learn more about the cellular function of PIMT, it is important to identify which proteins serve as major targets of its action in vivo. As an approach to this goal, we report here an extension of our previous studies on the effect of PIMT inhibition in PC12 cells (12Johnson B.A. Najbauer J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6174-6181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treating cells with AdOx inhibitsS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolase causing a large increase in intracellularS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, a potent competitive inhibitor of PIMT, and many other AdoMet-utilizing methyltransferases (15Hoffman J.L. Usdin E. Borchardt R.T. Creveling C.R. Transmethylation. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Incl, New York1979: 181-186Google Scholar, 16Bartel R.L. Borchardt R.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 418-424PubMed Google Scholar). This results in a significant increase in isoAsp levels, consistent with the hypothesis that PIMT repairs isoAsp sites or targets isoAsp proteins for degradation. In the present work, we started by characterizing AdOx-related changes in the methyl-accepting capacity of various subcellular fractions of this cell line. This led to the finding of a very large and selective isoAsp increase in a 14-kDa nuclear protein that we identified as histone H2B. Based on previous studies (17Mamula M.J. Gee R.J. Elliott J.I.

Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), the presence of isoAsp-containing self-proteins may initiate autoimmune responses similar to those found in systemic lupus erythematosus. S-Adenosyl-[methyl-3H]l-methionine (15 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. AdoMet of lower specific activity was prepared by dilution with unlabeled, purified AdoMet (19Chirpich T.P. Lysine 2,3-aminomutase; purification and properties.Ph.D. dissertation. University of California, Berkeley1968Google Scholar). Calf thymus histone H2B and mixed core histones were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other chemicals, including AdOx, were purchased from Sigma. Synthesis and characterization of the peptide R3 (Ac-GGRGGFGGRGGFGGRGGFG-NH2) has been described (20Najbauer J. Johnson B.A. Young A.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10501-10509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PIMT from cow brain, used in early experiments, was prepared as described by Aswad and Deight (21Aswad D.W. Deight E.A. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 1718-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recombinant rat PIMT, used in later experiments, was prepared according to David and Aswad (22David C.L. Aswad D.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Rat PC12 cells were obtained from Dr. Gabor Tigyi at the University of California, Irvine. All culture media were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. PIMT knockout(−/−) and wild-type(+/+) littermates were bred from PIMT(+/−) founder pairs generously provided by Dr. Edward Kim, Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, San Francisco and Dr. Stephen Clarke of the University of California, Los Angeles (13Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Mice were screened for the presence of the neo gene and the absence of the PIMT gene by polymerase chain reaction analysis of tail DNA. Primer sequences were: PIMT forward, 5′-gcagcgacggcagtaacagc-3′; PIMT reverse, 5′cgcatcgagcgagcacgtactcgg-3′; neo forward, 5′-gcacgaggaagcggtcagcccattc-3′; neo reverse, 5′-cgcatcgagcgagcacgtactcgg-3′. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at ∼4–6 weeks of age. Brains were rapidly removed and frozen at −80 °C prior to analysis. Cell cultures were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml in 50 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% normal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 1 μg/ml Fungizone on polylysine-coated 175-cm2 polystyrene flasks. One hour after seeding, 0.5 ml of 1 mm AdOx was added to a final concentration of 10 μm to half of the flasks; an identical volume of RPMI media was added to the remaining “control,” or untreated, flasks. Cultures were grown in a humidified atmosphere for 1 or 3 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cell counts and viability measurements were performed on cells diluted (1:5) with trypan blue stain and counted in a hemacytometer. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of chilled H1 buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/liter leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) per 1 × 108 cells and then disrupted with a chilled Dounce homogenizer using 10 strokes with a loose pestle and 65 strokes with a tight pestle. Sucrose (2m in H1 buffer) was added to the extract to a final concentration of 0.25 m. Subcellular fractionation of PC12 cell homogenates was carried out by differential centrifugation according to Rickwood (23Rickwood D. Rickwood D. Centrifugation: A Practical Approach. Information Retreival Ltd., London1978: 135-142Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4 °C. Fractions enriched in nuclei and mitochondria were obtained as pellets resulting from 10-min spins at 3000 ×g and 9800 × g, respectively, in a Beckman JA-20 rotor. The membrane/microsome-enriched fraction was obtained as the pellet from a 50-min spin of the postmitochondrial supernatant at 100,000 × g in a Beckman 50 Ti rotor. Each fraction was the result of two identical spins, the second serving as a wash to reduce cross-contamination between fractions. Washed pellets were resuspended in an approximately equal weight of H1 buffer by 20 passages through a 25-gauge needle and then stored at −70 °C in the presence of 10% glycerol. The cytosol fraction, taken as the 100,000 × g postmembrane/microsomal supernatant, was stored at −70 °C in the presence of 5% glycerol. Preparation of mouse brain nuclei was carried out at 4 °C. Four brains (weighing a total of 1.5 ± 0.1 g) from wild-type(+/+) or PIMT knockout(−/−) mice were homogenized in a Teflon/glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in 9 volumes of H2 buffer (5 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.6, containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) sucrose, and a 1/100 dilution of mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma catalog number P8340)). The crude nuclear fraction was obtained as the pellet from a 20-min centrifugation at 800 × g, dispersed into 8 ml of fresh H2 buffer by 20 passages through a 25-gauge needle, and then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in 6 ml of H2 buffer. Nuclei were stored at −70 °C after addition of glycerol to 10% (w/v). Methylation of subcellular fractions or isolated histones was carried out for 10 min at 30 °C in 10–1000-μl reactions containing 50 mm K-MES, pH 6.2, 20–50 μm [methyl-3H]AdoMet (5000–10,000 dpm/pmol), 1.5–8.0 μm purified PIMT, and substrate protein as indicated in the relevant figure. Reactions were stopped with either electrophoresis sample buffer (for gel electrophoresis) or with HCl (for histone isolation). Methylation reaction conditions were designed to achieve maximal methylation of available isoAsp sites (24Johnson B.A. Aswad D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Methylation reactions containing nuclei from PC12 cells or mouse brains were terminated by the addition of HCl to a final concentration of 0.2–0.4 m. After mixing for 1 h at 4 °C, acidified samples were centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 10 min. Histones were precipitated from the supernatant by adding 10 volumes of cold acetone and incubating overnight at 4 °C. Precipitated histones were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in acetone:ethanol (1:1), repelleted, and then air-dried. Acidic SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) at pH 2.4 was carried out according to Fairbanks and Avruch (25Fairbanks G. Avruch J. J. Supramol. Struct. 1972; 1: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), except that the catalyst concentrations were raised to 0.15% ascorbic acid, 0.0045% ferrous sulfate, and 0.09% hydrogen peroxide. Gels were run at a constant 50 V for 2.5 h, stained with Coomassie Blue, and subjected to fluorography by the method of Laskey and Mills (26Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 56: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (3037) Google Scholar). Urea/acetic acid/Triton (UAT) gels were composed of 15% acrylamide, 8 m urea, 5% acetic acid, and 0.375% Triton X-100 (27Weikowski M. DePamphilis M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Gels were run in a Bio-Rad mini-Protean II apparatus at 200 V constant voltage for 1.75 h using 5% acetic acid as the running buffer. Staining and fluorography were the same as for the SDS-PAGE. 3H-Methylated histones were solubilized in 0.3% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto a reversed-phase HPLC column (Brownlee Labs RP-300, 100 × 4.6 mm) pre-equilibrated with 0.3% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 35% (v/v) acetonitrile in water. Histones were eluted by increasing the acetonitrile concentration to 70% over 60 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, and a portion of each fraction was subjected to liquid scintillation counting after addition of 1.0 ml of Liquiscint (National Diagnostics). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after precipitation in the presence of 7% trichloroacetic acid. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. We previously demonstrated that treatment of PC12 cells with 10 μm AdOx for 24 h significantly increased the isoAsp content of cellular proteins as judged by the ability to accept [3H]methyl groups from [methyl-3H]AdoMet in an in vitroreaction catalyzed by PIMT (12Johnson B.A. Najbauer J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6174-6181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In that study, methylation was carried out on proteins present in a 38,000 × g supernatant obtained from cell homogenates. This rise in isoAsp sites in response to PIMT inhibition was predicted by the hypothesis that PIMT functionsin vivo to prevent isoAsp accumulation either by repairing these sites or by facilitating the degradation of the polypeptides in which they arise. To determine how isoAsp accumulation is distributed among various cell fractions, we carried out a similar incubation of PC12 cells in the presence or absence of 10 μm AdOx for 24 h and then fractionated the cells by differential centrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples of each fraction were3H-methylated in vitro with purified PIMT and then subjected to SDS-PAGE at pH 2.4. Fig.1A shows that a substantial AdOx-dependent increase in isoAsp occurred in all of the fractions analyzed. The smallest increase occurred in the mitochondrial fraction, and much of this appeared to be due to cross-contamination by the membrane fraction. Previous studies on the basal level of isoAsp sites in subcellular fractions of rat brain revealed significantly lower levels of isoAsp in the mitochondrial fraction than in synaptic membranes (29Johnson B.A. Aswad D.W. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 1119-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Of the AdOx effects seen in Fig. 1A, the single most dramatic increase was observed at 14 kDa in the nuclear fraction. To confirm that this increased labeling was caused by isoAsp and not the modification of arginine residues by endogenous protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (30Tang J. Frankel A. Cook R.J. Kim S. Paik W.K. Williams K.R. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7723-7730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), we carried out methylation of a +AdOx nuclear extract with or without added PIMT. We also included in this assay the highly effective R3 peptide substrate for protein arginine methyltransferase 1 to further reduce any endogenous protein arginine methylation (20Najbauer J. Johnson B.A. Young A.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10501-10509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that methylation of the 14-kDa protein was indeed PIMT-dependent and therefore reflects increased isoAsp resulting from the AdOx-induced inhibition of PIMT in the cultured PC12 cells. The apparent mass and nuclear location of the 14-kDa protein suggested to us that it might be a histone. We therefore isolated nuclei from +AdOx and −AdOx cells, subjected them to 3H-methylation in vitro, and then extracted the histone-rich fraction with 0.2m HCl. SDS-PAGE at pH 2.4 revealed that virtually all of the 14-kDa protein was solubilized by the acid, and none was present in the acid-insoluble pellet (data not shown). To determine which histone(s) or histone-like protein(s) carried the [3H]methyl label, we analyzed acid extracts of3H-methylated nuclei by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a UAT buffer system commonly used for histone separation. As shown in Fig. 2, most of the [3H]methyl label comigrated with a histone H2B standard and not with standards of the other three core histones (H2A, H3, and H4). Automethylation of PIMT was seen in both lanes. Automethylation of PIMT has been reported (31Lindquist J.A. McFadden P.N. J. Protein Chem. 1994; 13: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and has been attributed to partial deamidation/isomerization of Asn188–Gln189 and Asp217–Lys218 (33Lindquist J.A. Barofsky E. McFadden P.N. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). AdOx-dependent methylation was also seen in proteins near and just below the position of histone H2A. This may reflect a small increase in isoAsp in native and partially degraded forms of H2A and/or the presence of isoAsp in other nuclear proteins that co-extract with histones. Because isoAsp formation is a non-enzymatic intramolecular reaction observed in many (but not all) proteins during in vitroaging at physiological pH and temperature, we incubated a commercial preparation of purified calf thymus H2B (which is identical in sequence to rat H2B) for 1 or 3 days at 37 °C, pH 7.4 and then assayed the histone for [3H]methyl-accepting capacity. As shown in Fig. 2B, the methylation capacity of calf H2B increased progressively over this incubation period. We have also observed a selective accumulation of isoAsp in H2B when purified rat mononucleosomes were incubated under the same conditions. 2W. G. Carter and D. W. Aswad, unpublished data. To confirm the identity of H2B as the major methyl acceptor in nuclei from AdOx-treated cells, we subjected the same type of3H-methylated acid extracts used in Fig. 2 to reversed-phase HPLC. Fig. 3 shows again that AdOx treatment of PC12 cells selectively and dramatically increased the methylation capacity of H2B. Separation of histones by HPLC facilitates the estimation of individual histone amounts (achieved by comparing peak sizes with those of histone standards run under the same conditions), allows easy quantitation of 3H-methyl incorporation by liquid scintillation counting of collected fractions, and is carried out under solvent conditions (0.3% trifluoroacetic acid) that stabilize isoAsp methyl esters. We therefore used the results of Fig. 3 to estimate the stoichiometry of isoAsp accumulation in H2B afforded by AdOx treatment. Data from panel Aindicate that ∼0.37% of the H2B molecules from AdOx-treated cells were methylated, whereas data from panel B indicate that only 0.02% of the H2B molecules from control cells were methylated. Although the methylation capacity is not high in either case, the increase is at least 18-fold. The absolute rate of isoAsp formation in H2B in vivo is almost certainly greater than 0.37% per 24 h. This conclusion is based on the fact that incubation of PC12 cells with AdOx does not completely inhibit PIMT activity (12Johnson B.A. Najbauer J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6174-6181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the fact that the instability of protein methyl esters typically results in yields of 80% or less (24Johnson B.A. Aswad D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). With these considerations in mind, we estimate that the rate of isoAsp formation in histone H2B is roughly 1% per day in cultured PC12 cells. The recent availability of PIMT KO mice provided us with an independent means of assessing the specificity and physiological relevance of isoAsp formation in histones. Brains from PIMT (−/−) or (+/+) littermates were homogenized and used to prepare a crude nuclear fraction as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After3H-methylating the nuclei in vitro with purified PIMT, histones were extracted and then separated by HPLC as in Fig. 3. As seen in Fig. 4, the results obtained with histones from PIMT (−/−) and (+/+) mice were strikingly similar to the results obtained with histones from the +AdOx and −AdOx PC12 cells, respectively. IsoAsp accumulation was seen exclusively in histone H2B. We calculated isoAsp stoichiometries of 8.1 and 0.09% in H2B from the (−/−) and (+/+) mice, respectively, resulting in a difference of at least 80-fold between the two genotypes. As with the data from Fig. 3, the absolute stoichiometries calculated here probably underestimate the true level and rate of isoAsp formation in the KO mice. In this case, the rate of isoAsp formation is underestimated not only because methyl esters are lost during the methylation and subsequent handling and analysis but also because of the likelihood that accumulation of damaged, isoAsp-containing H2B molecules is attenuated and ultimately limited by proteolytic degradation pathways (34Lowenson J.D. Kim E. Young S.G. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20695-20702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We suspect that 10–12% of H2B molecules in the (−/−) mice contain isoAsp. Regardless of the exact stoichiometry, the isoAsp content of H2B in the KO mice is considerably higher than in the normal mice, and the absolute level of isoAsp in these mice is an order of magnitude greater than that found during short-term, partial inhibition of PIMT in PC12 cells. Our findings suggest that histone H2B generates isoAsp sites at a rate of ∼1% per day in rodents. Accumulation of isoAsp sites under normal conditions is apparently held in check by the action of PIMT. When PIMT activity is reduced by chemical inhibition (AdOx) or by genetic means, isoAsp accumulates well beyond its normal levels in numerous proteins. The ability of PIMT to repair isoAsp sites in vitro implies that it may also function in vivo as a repair enzyme. An alternative in vivo role for PIMT is that it promotes rapid degradation of isoAsp-bearing proteins. Histones are abundant proteins that exhibit extremely slow turnover. As components of the nucleosome, core histones play a key role in stabilizing DNA structure and in mediating alterations in the accessibility of DNA to nucleic acid polymerases and regulatory proteins during transcription and cell division. Depending on the location(s) in H2B, isoAsp sites could destabilize nucleosome structure and/or disrupt interaction of the flexible N terminus of H2B with the surrounding DNA and with proteins that regulate chromatin structure. Accumulation of isoAsp in H2B may make an important contribution to the reduced life span of PIMT KO mice and to any mammalian condition in which PIMT expression is abnormally low. In vitro aging of synthetic peptides and structured proteins indicates that isoAsp forms most readily at Asn-Gly, Asn-Ser, and Asp-Gly sites when the polypeptide flexibility encompassing such sequences is high (4Aswad D.W. Paranandi M.V. Schurter B.T. J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 2000; 21: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 5Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 91-113Google Scholar). The presence of an Asp-Gly sequence in positions 25–26 at the boundary of the highly flexible N terminus of H2B may explain why isoAsp accumulation is unique to this histone. The only other occurrence of these three isoAsp-prone sequences in rat core histones is Asn63-Ser64 found in the more structured central region of histone H2B. None of the other three core histones have any Asn or Asp sites that are predicted to isomerize rapidly. Recent studies2 suggest that Asp25-Gly26 is in fact the major site of isopeptide bond formation in H2B. This means that PIMT-dependent conversion of the isopeptide bond to a normal peptide bond would constitute a complete repair of the damaged histone. Such a repair would not be complete if isoAsp arose via deamidation of an Asn site. Lowenson et al. (34Lowenson J.D. Kim E. Young S.G. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20695-20702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have recently reported on the phenotype of PIMT KO mice in which PIMT activity was selectively restored to neurons using a transgene controlled by the neuron-specific enolase promoter. Although PIMT activity in the transgenic brains was restored to only 13% of its normal value, these mice lived 5 times longer than the KO mice, and epileptic seizures were correspondingly delayed. This suggests that neurons have a stronger need than other cell types to keep isoAsp levels in check, an idea that fits well with the observations that brain exhibits relatively high levels of PIMT in mammals and that the accumulation of isoAsp sites in PIMT KO mice is most dramatic in the brain (13Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 14Yamamoto A. Takagi H. Kitamura D. Tatsuoka H.

Although histones are abundant in all cells that have DNA, the highly complex functions of neurons may be particularly sensitive to abnormalities of gene expression. The selective accumulation of isoAsp in histone H2B also has interesting implications regarding molecular mechanisms that lead to autoimmunity.

By the process of epitope spreading, antibodies are also made to other regions of the same protein and to other proteins that strongly associate with the isoAsp protein.

Many types, including voltage-gated potassium channels, are assembled as heteromultimeric complexes including distinct pore-forming and accessory or modulatory subunits. The manner in which these complexes are formed and the structural basis by which subunits interact are under-studied areas of ion channel biology. Members of a new class of voltage-gated potassium channels encoded by the KCNQ gene subfamily have been implicated in inherited forms of cardiac arrhythmia (1Wang Q. Curran M.E. Splawski I. Burn T.C.

Recombinant KCNQ/KCNE potassium channels are excellent tools with which to study physiologically important subunit-subunit interactions. Previous work by many investigators has provided provocative ideas regarding how minK interacts with KvLQT1 and which regions of KvLQT1 are involved in minK-mediated modulation. Romeyet al. (17Romey G. Attali B. Chouabe C. Abitbol I. Guillemare E. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16713-16716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) used yeast two-hybrid and immunodetection analysis to demonstrate that the KvLQT1 pore loop may interact directly with the minK carboxyl terminus, although surprisingly, no other intersubunit interactions were detected. Tai and Goldstein (18Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Nature. 1998; 391: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) used scanning cysteine mutagenesis to demonstrate that cysteine substitution of amino acids within the minK transmembrane domain rendered IKs susceptible to partial block by external Cd2+. In this study, Cd2+ inhibition of the potassium current appeared to occur by direct pore block, suggesting that the minK transmembrane domain may line the permeation pathway of the channel complex. Recently, Kurokawa et al. (22Kurokawa J. Motoike H.K. Kass R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) argued against the idea that minK resides within the IKspore region on the basis of their observation that channels remain Cd2+-sensitive during high affinity pore block by tetraethylammonium. We have recently shown that association of minK with KvLQT1 is mediated, in part, by residues within its transmembrane segment (19Tapper A.R. George Jr., A.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Despite these efforts, fundamental questions regarding the location and orientation of minK within the IKs channel complex remain unanswered. We have now determined that a cysteine residue native to the KvLQT1 S6 transmembrane segment (Cys-331) is necessary to form a Cd2+binding site in conjunction with engineered cysteines in the minK transmembrane domain. These data indicate that the minK transmembrane segment must reside in close proximity to the KvLQT1 S6 segment in the IKs channel complex. By homology with the structure of the bacterial potassium channel KcsA, the sulfhydryl side chain of Cys-331 projects away from the central axis of the KvLQT1 pore, and this argues that minK resides outside of the permeation pathway. Using a helical wheel model for the orientation of minK in relation to S6, we successfully predicted a novel Cd2+ binding site that could be created by engineering additional cysteine residues into both subunits. Our findings establish spatial relationships between two important families of potassium channel subunits and provide a new framework for interpreting data regarding structure and function inKCNQ/KCNE channels. Mutations in KvLQT1 and minK were introduced using site-directed polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis as previously described (19Tapper A.R. George Jr., A.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). KvLQT1 and minK mutant constructs were unidirectionally ligated into plasmid vectors pSP64T and pRc/CMV, respectively. RNA from all KvLQT1 and minK contructs were transcribed in vitro from EcoRI- orXbaI-linearized DNA templates using Sp6 or T7 RNA polymerase and other reagents included in the mMessage mMachine transcription system (Ambion Corp.). RNA size and integrity were evaluated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, and full-length RNA concentrations were estimated by comparison with a 0.24–9.5-kb RNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.). Currents were recorded from oocytes at room temperature 2–5 days after injection using a two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique with an OC-725B amplifier (Warner Instruments Corp.). Pipettes were filled with 3 m KCl and had 0.5–2mΩ resistances. Oocytes were bathed in ND-96 containing (in mm): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.5. For Cd2+experiments, a modified ND-96 solution in which NaCl was replaced isotonically with CdCl2 was used. In these experiments, oocytes were depolarized to +20 mV for 10 s from a holding potential of −80 mV, and this was repeated at 30-s intervals. Once a steady-state current level was achieved, Cd2+ was perfused into the bath, and repetitive pulsing was continued to monitor the effect. Typically, Cd2+ elicited a maximum effect after 8–11 pulses (320–440 s). Washout was performed by bath perfusion with ND-96 after a plateau in Cd2+-induced current reduction was reached. To minimize contamination of endogenous XenopusKvLQT1 (xKvLQT1), only currents larger than 1 μA were selected for use in experiments. In addition, xKvLQT1 levels were monitored in each batch of oocytes by injecting minK cRNA into control cells. For each set of experiments, IKs derived from xKvLQT1 never exceeded 0.2 μA when recorded at the end of a 10-s test depolarization to +20 mV. Data were recorded using the pCLAMP-6 software program (Axon Instruments, Inc.), filtered at 200 Hz, and digitized at 1 kHz. Data were analyzed and plotted using a combination of pCLAMP and Origin (Microcal) software packages. Normalized isochronal voltage-activation relationships were obtained by measuring current 2 s after the onset of depolarizing test pulses between −50 and +60 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV. Data were fit with a Boltzmann function of the form: 1/{1 + exp[(V −V½app)/kapp]}, where V½app is the apparent half-maximal activation voltage and kapp is the apparent slope factor. Other data are presented as means ± S.E., and comparisons were made using Student's t test with significance assumed at the p < 0.05 level. A homology model of the KvLQT1 pore was constructed by aligning the KvLQT1 amino acid sequence spanning the pore loop through the S6 transmembrane segment with the KcsA crystallographic coordinates obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Homology alignment and energy minimization (24Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9555) Google Scholar) were performed by the SWISS-MODEL server (www.expasy.ch/spdbv/). The model was rendered using the biopolymer module within Insight II (version 98.0; Molecular Simulations, Burlington, MA). Tai and Goldstein (18Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Nature. 1998; 391: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) reported that cysteine substitution of two residues within the minK transmembrane segment (Phe-54 and Gly-55) confers heterologously expressed IKs channels (KvLQT1 co-expressed with minK) with susceptibility to partial block by external Cd2+. Fig. 1illustrates this effect of Cd2+ on channels expressed inXenopus oocytes. With depolarization to +20 mV, oocytes expressing KvLQT1 with wild-type minK exhibit slowly activating outward potassium currents that are relatively insensitive to external 0.5 mm Cd2+ (Fig. 1, A andE). By contrast, oocytes expressing KvLQT1 with either one of two minK cysteine mutants (F54C or G55C) have outward currents that can be blocked partially and reversibly by external Cd2+. After a 3-min extracellular exposure to 0.5 mmCd2+, currents derived from F54C or G55C minK and KvLQT1 channels were reduced by an average of 39.6 ± 5.4% (n = 5) and 36.0 ± 4.3% (n = 5), respectively. compared with only 4.5 ± 1.4% (n = 5) for wild-type channels. These data indicate that expression of KvLQT1 with F54C or G55C minK creates a Cd2+ coordination site that is not present or very weak in wild-type channels. In complex protein structures, binding of Cd2+, a soft metal ion, can occur when two or more electron-donating Lewis base amino acid side chains, such as those present in cysteines, are in close proximity (20Lippard S.J. Berg J.M. Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1994Google Scholar). In channel complexes containing either F54C or G55C, we hypothesize that a cysteine residue native to KvLQT1 participates with engineered minK cysteines to coordinate Cd2+. To test our hypothesis, we individually mutated three potentially accessible native KvLQT1 cysteines, co-expressed the mutants with F54C or G55C, and determined the effect of Cd2+ on the resulting channels. KvLQT1 contains seven endogenous cysteines. Three cysteines, Cys-136 (S1 segment), Cys-214 (S3 segment), and Cys-331 (S6 segment), are located within transmembrane segments and could potentially reside adjacent to the membrane-spanning domain of minK. The remaining four cysteine residues are located within intracellular regions of the protein and were not considered to be likely coordinating ligands for extracellular metal ions. To determine whether any of these residues are required for the effect of Cd2+, we individually mutated each residue to alanine (C136A, C214A, and C331A) and characterized the resulting channels in the presence or absence of the minK cysteine mutants. When expressed alone, all three KvLQT1 mutants formed functional channels that exhibited rapidly activating outward potassium currents in response to membrane depolarization (Fig.2, top). Each mutant also displayed a “hook” in deactivating tail currents that is characteristic of wild-type KvLQT1. The voltage dependence of activation determined for each mutant was also very similar to that of wild-type KvLQT1, although C136A did have an approximately −10-mV shift in activation compared with wild-type KvLQT1, as well as a slower rate of deactivation (Table I and Fig.2). Coexpression of minK with each mutant resulted in slowing of activation, removal of inactivation, and a significant positive shift in the apparent voltage dependence of activation (Fig. 2,bottom, and Table I). Although minK did shift theV½app of C136A and C214A to a lesser extent than wild-type KvLQT1 (Table I), these results generally indicate that the alanine substitutions did not drastically alter function of the channel.Table IApparent voltage at half-maximal activation and slope factors for mutant and wild-type KvLQT1 expressed with or without minKChannelV½ appkappΔV½ app1-aDifference betweenV½ app determined in the presence and absence of minK.mVmVKvLQT1−22.4 ± 1.111.2 ± 1.0C136A KvLQT1−31.9 ± 1.89.6 ± 1.6C214A KvLQT1−22.4 ± 1.412.1 ± 1.2C331A KvLQT1−15.6 ± 1.514.0 ± 1.3KvLQT1 + minK31.2 ± 1.513.3 ± 1.453.7 ± 2.9C136A KvLQT1 + minK2.3 ± 2.219.6 ± 1.627.3 ± 6.51-bp < 0.01.C214A KvLQT1 + minK22.5 ± 2.221.0 ± 1.137.8 ± 3.21-bp < 0.01.C331A KvLQT1 + minK21.5 ± 2.017.1 ± 1.736.5 ± 11.21-a Difference betweenV½ app determined in the presence and absence of minK.1-b p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab Coexpression of C136A or C214A with either F54C or G55C minK yielded currents that were significantly reduced by external 0.5 mmCd2+ (Fig. 3, Aand B; n = 6). However, coexpression of F54C or G55C with C331A resulted in Cd2+-insensitive currents (Fig. 3C). The proportion of Cd2+-insensitive, steady-state outward current measured at +20 mV in these experiments was 94 ± 4.1% (n = 8) and 94.4 ± 2.4% (n = 8) for C331A expressed with F54C and G55C, respectively (compared with 95.5 ± 1.4, 60.4 ± 5.4, and 64.0 ± 4.3% for wild-type KvLQT1 expressed with wild-type minK, F54C, and G55C, respectively.). Even at a 4-fold higher Cd2+ concentration (2 mm), the degree of block exhibited by channel complexes containing C331A was substantially less than for channels containing wild-type KvLQT1 (current remaining after application of 2 mm external Cd2+: wild-type KvLQT1 and wild-type minK, 95.3 ± 1.9%; n = 5; wild-type KvLQT1 and G55C, 52.9 ± 3.0%; n = 5; KvLQT1 and F54C, 47.8 ± 4.2%; n = 5; C331A and G55C, 90.0 ± 2.3%; n = 9; and C331A and F54C, 85.4 ± 2.2%; n = 9; data are from at least three experiments). Together, our results indicate that the effect of Cd2+ on IKs channel complexes containing F54C or G55C is dependent on Cys-331 in KvLQT1 and that this residue likely participates with a cysteine in the minK transmembrane domain to form a metal ion coordination site. Given that the mean cadmium-sulfur bond distances in metalloproteins with defined structure is 2.6 Å (21Rulisek L. Vondrasek J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1998; 71: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), our results indicate that minK must reside in very close proximity (within ∼5 Å) to the KvLQT1 S6 segment in the IKs channel complex. There are data both supporting and refuting the idea that minK may line the pore of IKs channels (18Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Nature. 1998; 391: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Kurokawa J. Motoike H.K. Kass R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In light of our data suggesting apposition of the minK transmembrane domain with the S6 segment of KvLQT1, the spatial orientation of the Cys-331 side chain relative to the central pore cavity should help define whether minK resides within or external to the conduction pathway. Using the atomic scale structure of the bacterial potassium channel KcsA (23Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5731) Google Scholar), we created a KvLQT1 homology model to examine the position of Cys-331 (24Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9555) Google Scholar). Fig. 4Aillustrates that the predicted position of this side chain in our model projects away from the central axis of the permeation pathway. This information suggests that to form a metal ion binding site between Cys-331 and minK, the accessory subunit must come into close contact with the region of the S6 transmembrane segment (analogous to the KcsA inner helix) facing away from the channel pore. Assuming that the minK transmembrane segment also forms an α-helix, this information further defines which helical surfaces must be directly opposed to facilitate formation of a Cd2+ coordination site between minK (Phe-54 or Gly-55) and the KvLQT1 S6 segment (Cys-331; Fig. 4B). Based on our helical wheel model, we predicted that a novel Cd2+coordination site could be engineered into the IKs channel complex by introducing cysteine residues in the minK transmembrane domain and KvLQT1 S6 segment that were in the same orientation as Phe-54 in minK and Cys-331 in KvLQT1. To test this, we placed cysteines at minK position 51 (L51C) and KvLQT1 position 328 (I328C) in the background of the Cd2+-insensitive C331A mutant. Both of these residues are predicted to reside one helical turn extracellular to minK amino acid 54 and KvLQT1 residue 331, respectively. Introducing a cysteine at position 51 of minK does not itself render the channel Cd2+-sensitive (Fig.5A). Also, expression of L51C minK alone in Xenopus oocytes generated small Cd2+-insensitive IKs currents, indicating that L51C does not confer Cd2+ sensitivity to the endogenous oocyte KvLQT1 (data not shown), in agreement with previously reported observations (18Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Nature. 1998; 391: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Similarly, coexpression of I328C KvLQT1 with wild-type minK resulted in the expression of Cd2+-insensitive currents. However, currents derived from coexpression of I328C KvLQT1 with L51C minK were significantly and reversibly reduced by external 0.5 mm Cd2+(current reduction was 13.1 ± 1.1%; Fig. 5). In addition, increasing the Cd2+ concentration to 2 mmcaused a 21.5 ± 1.2% current reduction, indicating that the Cd2+ effect is dose-dependent (data not shown;n = 4). These data indicate that L51C and I328C are sufficiently close to form a novel metal ion binding site and support the predicted location and orientation of minK within the IKs channel complex. KvLQT1 associates with minK in the heart to form a channel complex responsible for the slowly activating potassium current, IKs, that is critical for myocardial repolarization (7Barhanin J. Lesage F.

The structural basis for subunit-subunit interactions in KCNQ/KCNEchannels bears fundamental importance for understanding their physiological and pathophysiological significance. The concept that members of the KCNE family of potassium channel subunits may have a structural role in forming theKCNQ permeation pathway has been advanced on the basis of a series of experiments reported by Tai and Goldstein (18Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Nature. 1998; 391: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These investigators suggested that Cd2+ reduces IKscurrent when channels are formed with certain minK cysteine mutants through a direct pore-blocking mechanism. A principal line of evidence supporting this conclusion was that the effect of Cd2+ on mutant channels could be competed with tetraethylammonium, a known potassium channel pore blocker. However, recently Kurokawa et al. (22Kurokawa J. Motoike H.K. Kass R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have shown that the effect of Cd2+ on channel complexes containing F54C or G55C is not pore-delimited, suggesting that minK may reside elsewhere in the IKs complex. The results from our Cd2+ susceptibility analysis provide a framework for defining the location and orientation of minK within the IKs channel complex. Our data indicate that KvLQT1 residue Cys-331 forms a Cd2+ binding site in conjunction with cysteines in minK, providing evidence that the KvLQT1 S6 segment comes within ∼5 Å of the minK transmembrane domain at the level of Phe-54 and Gly-55. In addition, because both minK mutants F54C and G55C can coordinate Cd2+ jointly with KvLQT1 Cys-331, we can approximate the orientation of the minK transmembrane domain in relation to the KvLQT1 S6 segment (Fig. 4B). Our data predict that the face of the minK helix containing Phe-54 and Gly-55 (Fig. 4B, red residues) faces the region of the KvLQT1 S6 segment containing residue Cys-331 with the sulfhydryl side chain positioned somewhere between the two minK residues. On the basis of the position of Cys-331 in a KvLQT1 homology model, we predict that this residue projects away from the central axis of the permeation pathway, suggesting that minK cannot effectively line the pore of the IKs channel complex (Fig. 4A). Consistent with this idea, three S6 residues analogous to amino acids demonstrated to be accessible through the inner pore vestibule ofShaker potassium channels (25Liu Y. Holmgren M. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1997; 19: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 26Zhou M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 411: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) reside on the helical face opposite Cys-331 (Fig. 4B, yellow residues). For minK to be positioned close to S6, we predict that an aqueous crevice is formed between the KvLQT1 S6 segment and other transmembrane regions, which provides access to minK in the assembled IKs channel complex. The effect of Cd2+ on KvLQT1/minK complexes is voltage-dependent, can modulate selectivity for monovalent cations, and decreases single channel current (18Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Nature. 1998; 391: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). How can these properties of Cd2+-sensitive channels be explained if not by a direct pore-blocking mechanism? We propose that Cd2+exerts its effect through an allosteric mechanism mediated through S6. First, it appears that an aqueous crevice must be formed between the minK transmembrane domain and the KvLQT1 S6 segment, allowing Cd2+ to reach its binding site. Once bound, Cd2+ may exert a steric influence on the position of the S6 transmembrane segment, leading to a conformational change within the channel complex that is transmitted to the adjacent pore loop. Even minor conformational changes that affect pore geometry are expected to modify the strict spatial relationships of carbonyl oxygen atoms responsible for binding dehydrated permeant ions (23Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5731) Google Scholar), resulting in altered cation selectivity and reduced single channel current amplitude. Furthermore, because the predicted Cd2+coordination site is located within the lipid bilayer, and possibly within the transmembrane electric field, Cd2+ binding may also be voltage-dependent, consistent with previous observations (18Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Nature. 1998; 391: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In summary, our results provide evidence defining the location and orientation of minK within the IKs channel complex. We further propose that Cd2+ exerts its effect on IKs through an allosteric mechanism as opposed to direct pore blockade. These findings provide new information relevant to understanding the structural basis of subunit-subunit interactions in voltage-gated potassium channels and will contribute to understanding the biophysical properties of KCNQ/KCNE channel complexes.

We are interested in this gene for two reasons. First, it codes for a distinct amino acid signature sequence (Sequence 1) categorizing it as a member of the Nudix hydrolases, a widespread family of enzymes catalyzing the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives (2Bessman M.J.

Furthermore, ygdP is of interest because we have previously demonstrated that another gene associated with invasion, ialA from Bartonella bacilliformis, the only bacterium known to invade human red blood cells, designates a Nudix hydrolase active on Ap4A1 (4Conyers G.B. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1203-1206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Cartwright J.L. Britton P. Minnick M.F. McLennan A.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In this paper we describe the cloning and expression of ygdPand the purification and characterization of the gene product, YgdP (Orf176). It has been identified as a member of the same subfamily of Nudix hydrolases active on Ap4A, Ap5A, and Ap6A. Thus, the ability to invade cells by these two very different human pathogens is associated with Nudix hydrolases specific for members of the diadenosine oligophosphate family, suggesting that this interesting class of compounds is involved in the invasion process. Enzymes used in cloning were from Stratagene, Life Technologies Inc., or United States Biochemical Corp. Biochemicals were from Sigma, and oligonucleotide primers were from Integrated DNA Technologies. PET11b and HMS174(DE3) were from Novagen. HiLoad® Superdex® and DEAE-Sepharose were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Gene ygdP (GenBankTMaccession number AE000366) was amplified from E. coliK12 genomic DNA prepared in this laboratory. Forward primers were constructed to contain an NdeI site and reverse primers to contain a BamHI site. After digestion withNdeI and BamHI, the gene was inserted into the corresponding sites of pET11b to form pOrf176 under control of a T7 promoter and was engineered into HMS174(DE3) for expression. Two liters of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin were inoculated with 40 ml of an overnight culture of pOrf176:HMS174(DE3), grown to anA600 of 0.8, and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mmfinal concentration). After 3 h at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, resuspended in 4 volumes of TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA) and disrupted in a French press. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 10 mg/ml by the addition of TE buffer. Two liters of cells cultured and treated in this manner yielded ∼30 ml of extract (Fraction I). Fraction I was adjusted to 1 m ammonium sulfate, applied to an anion exchange column (DEAE-Sepharose, 2.5 × 24 cm), and eluted with TE buffer. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated by precipitation in 60% saturated ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was dissolved in a minimal volume of TE buffer (Fraction II). Fraction II was applied to a gel filtration column (HiLoad® Superdex®)and eluted with TE buffer containing 200 mmNaCl. Active fractions were combined and concentrated by precipitation in 60% ammonium sulfate, dialyzed against TE buffer containing 100 mm ammonium sulfate, and stored at −80 °C. This assay measures the conversion of a phosphatase-insensitive substrate to a phosphatase-sensitive product. The standard incubation mixture contained in 50 μl: 2 mmsubstrate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 4 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and 0.1–1 milliunit of enzyme. After 15 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 250 μl of 4 mm EDTA and assayed for Pi by the procedure of Ames and Dubin (6Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A unit of enzyme hydrolyzes 1 μmol of substrate/min under these conditions. Note that for every μmol of Ap5A hydrolyzed, 5 μmol of Pi is produced. Cloning ofygdP and expression of YgdP protein in host HMS174(DE3) produced a strongly visible band on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel that was not found with the parent vector. Treatment of the cell extract as outlined under “Methods” yielded ∼12 mg of highly purified protein as seen in Fig. 1. Usually, our first step in a purification scheme is the removal of nucleic acids with streptomycin. However, in this instance, YgdP precipitated with the nucleic acids fraction and then resisted all efforts at further purification. This was most likely a result of the high concentration of basic amino acids in the protein (net charge, 12; pI, 11.1) interacting with the polyanionic nucleic acids. An alternate procedure involving the adsorption of the nucleic acids on a polycationic resin (DEAE-Sepharose) was successful in separating the protein for further purification by gel filtration. The presence in YgdP of the signature sequence characteristic of the Nudix hydrolases strongly implicated a nucleoside diphosphate derivative as a likely substrate of the enzyme. Furthermore, the association of ygdP with invasion and the strong homology of the protein with IalA, the invasion protein of B. bacilliformis (see Fig.2), suggested that Ap4A, the substrate of the Bartonella enzyme, was also likely to be a substrate for YgdP. Accordingly, several members of the diadenosine oligophosphate family were tested as substrates. As expected, the enzyme hydrolyzed Ap4A, but Ap5A was hydrolyzed at a higher rate. This is shown in TableI along with data from theBartonella enzyme IalA for comparison. As with IalA, YgdP had little or no activity toward the lower homologue of the diadenosine oligophosphate family, Ap3A, and with the higher homologue, Ap6A, the rate was approximately 70% of the favored substrate. YgdP did not act on other nucleoside diphosphate derivatives such as ADP-ribose, NADH, UDP-glucose, etc., typical substrates of various members of the Nudix hydrolase family (data not shown)Table ISubstrate specificities of YgdP and IalASubstrateRelative activityYgdPIalA1-aThese data are taken from Ref. 4.Ap3A<1<1Ap4A14100Ap5A10077Ap6A9267All substrates were present at a concentration of 1 mm in the standard assay.

The favored substrate for each enzyme under these conditions was set at 100. The actual value for YgdP was 3.3 nmol of Ap5A hydrolyzed and for IalA, 12.3 nmol of Ap4A hydrolyzed. The standard assay was scaled up and modified to omit alkaline phosphatase. After 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min of incubation, aliquots were applied to a calibrated reverse phase column and subjected to high performance liquid chromatography. Fig.3 is a tracing of the zero time and 20 min values. Intermediate time points (not shown) had similar profiles allowing for their relative incubation times. A visual inspection of the chromatogram shows the formation of ATP and ADP at the expense of Ap5A. Quantification of the nucleotide species by integrating the areas under the respective curves indicated that at 20 min, 24 nmol of Ap4A were hydrolyzed with the concomitant formation of ∼26 nmol of ATP and 27 nmol of ADP. No Ap4A was detectable throughout the course of the incubation. The stoichiometry of the hydrolytic reaction is described by the following equation: Ap5A + H2O → ATP + ADP. In corresponding experiments, Ap4A led to the formation of ATP and AMP, and Ap6A yielded 2 mol of ATP (data not shown). Thus with all three substrates ATP was produced, suggesting that the nucleophilic attack was on the gamma or delta phosphorus. YgdP behaves like a monomer in solution, eluting from a gel filtration column at a position characteristic of a 20-kDa protein. It has an absolute requirement for a divalent cation and is maximally active at 10 mmMg2+ and to a lesser extent with Zn2+ and Mn2+. Like most of the other Nudix hydrolases YgdP has an alkaline pH optimum between 8.5 and 9.0, and under optimal conditions it has a specific activity of ∼3.3 units mg−1 protein, equivalent to a kcat of 1 s−1 andKm of 0.36 for Ap5A and akcat of 0.1 and Km of 0.07 for Ap4A. Here we present a second example in which a gene associated with the invasiveness of a human pathogen has been shown to be a member of the Nudix hydrolase subfamily of dinucleoside oligophosphate pyrophosphatases. In B. bacilliformis, the invasion-associated gene ialA codes for an Ap4A pyrophosphatase (4Conyers G.B. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1203-1206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Cartwright J.L. Britton P. Minnick M.F. McLennan A.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this paper it has been demonstrated that ygdP, associated with the invasiveness of E. coli K1, designates an enzyme preferring diadenosine pentaphosphate. Actually, both enzymes are active on Ap4A, Ap5A, and Ap6A, as shown in Table I, and so the differences in their relative specificities may only reflect small changes in the architecture of the active site brought about by random amino acid substitutions in this region. The area containing the Nudix signature sequence (see Fig. 2) encompasses the catalytic site of members of the Nudix hydrolase family (7Frick D.N. Weber D.J. Abeygunawardana C. Gittis A.G.

Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the Ap4A Nudix hydrolase from Lupinus angustifolius has been solved (11Swarbrick J.D. Bashtannyk T. Maksel D. Zhang X.-R. Blackburn G.M. Gayler K.R.

Amzell, unpublished observations. A comparison of these two structures may provide insight into the physical basis for the small differences in specificity. The dinucleoside oligophosphates themselves were discovered in 1966 as a byproduct of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase reactions (12Zamecnik P.C. Stephenson M.L. Janeway C.M. Randerath K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 24: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and since that time there have been numerous reports of their presence intracellularly in many different cell types, as well as extracellularly in chromaffin granules, secretory cells, synaptosomes, and synaptic vesicles (for review see Ref. 13McClennan A.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 73-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). All of these substrates, including Ap3A, have been implicated in diverse physiological responses such as inhibition of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (14Jovanovic A. Alekseev A.E. Terzic A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 54: 219-225Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), activation of purinoceptors (15Pintor J. Diaz-Hernandez M. Gualix J. Gomez-Villafuertes R. Hernando F. Miras-Portugal M.T. Pharmacol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and involvement in pain transduction (17Burgstahler R. Grafe P. NeuroReport. 2001; 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). They have thus been categorized as a novel class of signaling molecules (18Kisselev L.L. Justesen J. Wolfson A.D. Frolova L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although there have been a plethora of reports on the distribution and putative function of this family of molecules, there is little hard evidence on their mechanism of action. One attractive hypothesis concerning the role of YgdP and IalA in cellular invasion relates to the observation that the diadenosine oligophosphates are involved in cellular stress responses. As a result of heat shock or oxidative stress, the concentrations of these compounds, termed ”alarmones,“ can increase more than 100-fold over their endogenous level (19Lee P.C. Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7496-7500Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 20Bochner B.R. Lee P.C. Wilson S.W. Cutler C.W. Ames B.N. Cell. 1984; 37: 225-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). YgdP and IalA might function by reducing the concentrations of these signaling molecules during the invasion process. If this were the case, the location of these enzymes in the cell would be an important determinant of their efficacy. In this regard, it has been shown that members of the diadenosine oligophosphate hydrolases from a variety of animal tissues areecto-enzymes located on the cell surface (21Mateo J. Miras-Portugal M.T. Rotlan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C918-C927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22von Drygalski A. Ogilvie A.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We are presently raising antibodies against pure YgdP in order to address this question. Although at present YgdP and IalA are the only two members of the diadenosine oligophosphate pyrophosphatases that have been characterized as invasion associated enzymes, it seems more than coincidental that this subfamily of the Nudix hydrolases is somehow involved in the invasion process.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Thirteen of the 16 organisms listed are well known invasive animal or plant pathogens, and a 14th, Mesorhizobium loti, is a root nodulating symbiont involved in nitrogen fixation. Preliminary characterization of the Rickettsia prowazekii homologous protein (third entry in Fig. 4) indicates that it is an Ap5A pyrophosphatase, 3Gaywee, J., Radulovic, S., Bessman, M. J., Kim, K. S., and Azad, A. F. (2001) Poster B-262, presented at the 101st General Meeting, American Society of Microbiology, Orlando, FL (May 20–24, 2001). and it is likely that many if not all of the other proteins listed in Fig. 4 are dinucleoside oligophosphate pyrophosphatases. In addition to ialA and ygdP, other genes of unknown function are associated with the invasion process in B. bacilliformis (25Mitchell S.J. Minnick M.F.

The identity of ialB, a gene supplementary to ialA and that is required for the invasion of human red blood cells by B. bacilliformis, has remained a mystery, because searches did not reveal significant similarity to other proteins in the data banks. We have recently uncovered an open reading frame (GenBankTM accession number BAB50118) in the newly sequenced M. loti genome (27Kaneko T. Nakamura Y. Sato S. Asamizu E. Kato T. Sasamato S.

It would be of interest to see whether the two unidentified genes from these widely different species complement each other and perhaps provide some clue as to the role played in the invasion process by this interesting family of dinucleoside oligophosphates and their cognate pyrophosphatases."

The hyperosmotic stress-induced nuclear exit of TC45 was not inhibited by leptomycin B, indicating that TC45 nuclear exit was independent of the exportin CRM-1. Moreover, hyperosmotic stress did not induce the cytoplasmic accumulation of a green fluorescent protein-TC45 fusion protein that was too large to diffuse across the nuclear pore. Our results indicate that TC45 nuclear exit may occur by passive diffusion and that cellular stress may induce the cytoplasmic accumulation of TC45 by inhibiting nuclear import.

We found that only those stresses that stimulated the metabolic stress-sensing enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) induced the redistribution of TC45.

Our studies indicate that specific stress-activated signaling pathways that involve the AMPK can alter the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of TC45 and thus regulate TC45 functionin vivo. protein-tyrosine phosphatase T-cell PTP nuclear localization sequence epidermal growth factor protein-tyrosine kinase 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase bovine serum albumin Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum phosphate-buffered saline c-Jun N-terminal kinase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis nuclear export sequence human immunodeficiency virus green fluorescent protein mitogen-activated protein kinase 5-aminoimidazole-4-calboxamide ribonucleoside Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs)1 are a large and structurally diverse family of enzymes that catalyze the dephosphorylation of tyrosyl phosphorylated proteins (1Tonks N.K.

Indeed, in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor activation, the TC45-D182A substrate trapping mutant, which can form stable complexes with tyrosine phosphorylated substrates including the EGF receptor (13Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), accumulates in the cytoplasm. Consistent with TC45 having an important role in events outside the nucleus, we have shown that both wild type TC45 and the TC45-D182A mutant can down-regulate the EGF- and integrin-induced activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase/Akt pathway, which has been implicated in cellular proliferation, migration, and survival (12Tiganis T. Kemp B.E. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27768-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies from our laboratory indicate that TC45 can also down-regulate insulin receptor-mediated signaling events at the cell surface. 2M. T. Fodero-Tavoletti, M.

Tiganis, unpublished observations.Whereas our previous studies have implicated importin β1 and an unidentified 116-kDa protein in the nuclear import of TC45 (10Tiganis T. Flint A.J. Adam S.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), nothing is known about the export of TC45. A characterization of the mechanism by which TC45 localization is regulated may yield broad insights into the regulation of receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) signal transduction.The 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a metabolic stress-sensing enzyme whose activity is elevated by a rise in the cellular AMP:ATP ratio. AMPK activity is elevated in response to vigorous exercise, nutrient starvation, and ischemia/hypoxia and the AMPK regulates transcription, exercise-induced glucose uptake and glycogen, fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis (14Kemp B.E.

Symp. 1999; 64: 13-27PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that specific cellular stresses that activate the AMPK cause a dramatic accumulation of TC45 in the cytosol. We report that TC45 nuclear exit occurs by passive diffusion and that TC45 localization may be regulated at the level of nuclear import. Our studies indicate that specific signaling events involving the AMPK can alter TC45 nucleocytoplasmic distribution to regulate TC45 access to substrates and therefore function.DISCUSSIONTC45 can regulate signal transduction events induced by receptor PTKs such as the EGF receptor at the cell surface. Hyperactivation of the EGF receptor is known to contribute to transformation and malignant progression of many human tumors. Therefore maintenance of TC45 in the cytoplasm may provide a means by which to suppress EGF receptor signaling in transformed cells. To this end we have focused on elucidating the processes involved in the control of TC45 subcellular localization. We have demonstrated that specific cellular stresses lead to the cytoplasmic accumulation of TC45. This change in localization of the phosphatase occurred in various cell types and was reversed when cellular stress was alleviated. As such, the events triggered by cellular stress can be regulated and may provide an important means for manipulating TC45 localization reversibly in vivo.Cellular stress may either stimulate nuclear export or inhibit nuclear import. A recent study has indicated that cellular stresses such as osmotic shock and H2O2 can induce the cytoplasmic accumulation of HIV Rev, whereas UV irradiation and heat shock have no effect (37Soros V. Cochrane A. Virology. 2001; 280: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the case of HIV Rev, it was concluded that cellular stress activated the CRM-1-mediated export of Rev (37Soros V. Cochrane A. Virology. 2001; 280: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that the TC45 nuclear import is an active process, as manifested by the apparently exclusive nuclear localization of the GFP-TC45 fusion protein that was too large to diffuse into the nucleus. In contrast, TC45 nuclear exit was independent of CRM-1 and occurred instead by passive diffusion. Accordingly, we propose that the stress-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of TC45 may result from an inhibition of TC45 nuclear import.Our previous studies indicate that TC45 nuclear import may occur via a novel mechanism (13Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas classical nuclear import is mediated by the direct interaction of importin α with SV40 T-antigen-like NLS motifs (31Ohno M. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1998; 92: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 32Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 38Jans D.A. Xiao C.Y. Lam M.H. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), the nuclear import of TC45 is conferred by an atypical bipartite NLS (10Tiganis T. Flint A.J. Adam S.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Like the NLS motifs of ribosomal protein L23a (39Jakel S. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), parathyroid hormone-related protein (40Lam M. Briggs L.J. Hu W. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7391-7398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and histone H1 (41Jakel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), which bind directly to importin β family members, the TC45 NLS binds directly to importin β1 (10Tiganis T. Flint A.J. Adam S.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition, the TC45 NLS also binds an unidentified 116-kDa protein and also interacts with lower affinity to importin α (10Tiganis T. Flint A.J. Adam S.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the case of L23a, parathyroid hormone-related protein, or histone H1, binding of importin β family members is sufficient for nuclear import independent of importin α. Moreover, in the case of histone H1, optimal nuclear import is conferred by a heterodimer of importin β1 and the importin β family member importin 7 (41Jakel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the case of TC45, importin β1 alone is not sufficient for nuclear import, and the nuclear import mechanism of TC45 may require additional factors such as the unidentified 116-kDa protein (10Tiganis T. Flint A.J. Adam S.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because the exact proteins mediating TC45 nuclear import remain unknown, we cannot ascertain directly whether cellular stress does indeed inhibit TC45 nuclear import using in vitro nuclear import assays.A recent study by Czubryt et al. (34Czubryt M.P. Austria J.A. Pierce G.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) has indicated that in digitonin permeabilized cells, H2O2-induced oxidative stress can inhibit the nuclear import of the SV40 T-antigen NLS. Moreover, this H2O2-induced inhibition of nuclear import is mediated by the MAPK p42Erk2 (34Czubryt M.P. Austria J.A. Pierce G.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the case of TC45, we showed that neither p42Erk2 nor the MAPKs JNK, or p38 were involved in the stress-induced cytoplasmic accumulation. These results are again consistent with distinct mechanisms for the nuclear import of TC45 and the SV40 T-antigen. In another recent study, Kehlenbach and Gerace (33Kehlenbach R.H. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17848-17856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have reported that in digitonin-permeabilized cells the activation of Ser/Thr kinases with Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors can suppress the nuclear import of the SV40 T-antigen NLS (mediated by importin α/β) and the import of M9 sequence of hnRNP A1 (mediated by the importin β family member transportin). In this latter study, a role for the MAPK p42Erk2 in the inhibition of nuclear import was excluded (33Kehlenbach R.H. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17848-17856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As such it would seem that multiple Ser/Thr kinases might play important roles in regulating the nuclear import of proteins. It is conceivable that distinct phosphorylation-dependent signaling cascades have evolved to regulate the import processes conferred by an ever growing number of importin family members (42Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).In this study we found a correlation between the cellular stresses that activated the Ser/Thr protein kinase AMPK and the induced cytoplasmic accumulation of TC45. Agents such as anisomycin, heat shock, and EGF that did not significantly activate the AMPK had no measurable effect on TC45 localization. We found that Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors such as okadaic acid, which lead to the hyperphosphorylation of proteinsin vivo but do not activate the AMPK in intact cells (43Moore F. Weekes J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), also had no effect on TC45 localization. Moreover, specific pharmacological activation of the AMPK with AICAR induced the cytoplasmic accumulation of TC45, providing compelling evidence that the AMPK may be a critical regulator of the subcellular distribution of TC45. Cellular stress and the AMPK exerted their effects on TC45 subcellular localization without altering the phosphorylation state of the phosphatase. Similarly, the activation of Ser/Thr kinases can lead to the inhibition of nuclear import of the M9 sequence of hnRNP A1 or SV40 large T-antigen NLS without altering the phosphorylation of these proteins (33Kehlenbach R.H. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17848-17856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34Czubryt M.P. Austria J.A. Pierce G.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore cellular stress and the AMPK may exert their effects by altering the phosphorylation state of proteins involved in the subcellular targeting of TC45 rather than the phosphatase itself. As has been previously postulated for the import of the SV40 T-antigen NLS and the M9 sequence of hnRNP A1 (33Kehlenbach R.H. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17848-17856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34Czubryt M.P. Austria J.A. Pierce G.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), this may involve the phosphorylation and inhibition of proteins involved in TC45 nuclear import.In this study we have shown that specific cellular stresses that activate the AMPK can induce the cytoplasmic accumulation of TC45. In the cytoplasm, TC45 down-regulates stress-induced signaling events including the activation of the EGF receptor and the MAPK JNK. Our results indicate that TC45 nuclear exit occurs by passive diffusion and that cellular stress-induced signaling pathways may act to inhibit TC45 nuclear import. The control of such signaling pathways would provide a means for achieving an acute regulation of TC45 localization and function in vivo. Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs)1 are a large and structurally diverse family of enzymes that catalyze the dephosphorylation of tyrosyl phosphorylated proteins (1Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the case of L23a, parathyroid hormone-related protein, or histone H1, binding of importin β family members is sufficient for nuclear import independent of importin α. Moreover, in the case of histone H1, optimal nuclear import is conferred by a heterodimer of importin β1 and the importin β family member importin 7 (41Jakel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the case of TC45, importin β1 alone is not sufficient for nuclear import, and the nuclear import mechanism of TC45 may require additional factors such as the unidentified 116-kDa protein (10Tiganis T.

Because the exact proteins mediating TC45 nuclear import remain unknown, we cannot ascertain directly whether cellular stress does indeed inhibit TC45 nuclear import using in vitro nuclear import assays.A recent study by Czubryt et al. (34Czubryt M.P. Austria J.A. Pierce G.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) has indicated that in digitonin permeabilized cells, H2O2-induced oxidative stress can inhibit the nuclear import of the SV40 T-antigen NLS. Moreover, this H2O2-induced inhibition of nuclear import is mediated by the MAPK p42Erk2 (34Czubryt M.P. Austria J.A. Pierce G.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the case of TC45, we showed that neither p42Erk2 nor the MAPKs JNK, or p38 were involved in the stress-induced cytoplasmic accumulation. These results are again consistent with distinct mechanisms for the nuclear import of TC45 and the SV40 T-antigen. In another recent study, Kehlenbach and Gerace (33Kehlenbach R.H. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17848-17856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have reported that in digitonin-permeabilized cells the activation of Ser/Thr kinases with Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors can suppress the nuclear import of the SV40 T-antigen NLS (mediated by importin α/β) and the import of M9 sequence of hnRNP A1 (mediated by the importin β family member transportin). In this latter study, a role for the MAPK p42Erk2 in the inhibition of nuclear import was excluded (33Kehlenbach R.H. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17848-17856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As such it would seem that multiple Ser/Thr kinases might play important roles in regulating the nuclear import of proteins. It is conceivable that distinct phosphorylation-dependent signaling cascades have evolved to regulate the import processes conferred by an ever growing number of importin family members (42Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).In this study we found a correlation between the cellular stresses that activated the Ser/Thr protein kinase AMPK and the induced cytoplasmic accumulation of TC45. Agents such as anisomycin, heat shock, and EGF that did not significantly activate the AMPK had no measurable effect on TC45 localization. We found that Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors such as okadaic acid, which lead to the hyperphosphorylation of proteinsin vivo but do not activate the AMPK in intact cells (43Moore F. Weekes J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), also had no effect on TC45 localization. Moreover, specific pharmacological activation of the AMPK with AICAR induced the cytoplasmic accumulation of TC45, providing compelling evidence that the AMPK may be a critical regulator of the subcellular distribution of TC45. Cellular stress and the AMPK exerted their effects on TC45 subcellular localization without altering the phosphorylation state of the phosphatase. Similarly, the activation of Ser/Thr kinases can lead to the inhibition of nuclear import of the M9 sequence of hnRNP A1 or SV40 large T-antigen NLS without altering the phosphorylation of these proteins (33Kehlenbach R.H. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17848-17856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34Czubryt M.P. Austria J.A. Pierce G.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore cellular stress and the AMPK may exert their effects by altering the phosphorylation state of proteins involved in the subcellular targeting of TC45 rather than the phosphatase itself. As has been previously postulated for the import of the SV40 T-antigen NLS and the M9 sequence of hnRNP A1 (33Kehlenbach R.H. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17848-17856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34Czubryt M.P. Austria J.A. Pierce G.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), this may involve the phosphorylation and inhibition of proteins involved in TC45 nuclear import.In this study we have shown that specific cellular stresses that activate the AMPK can induce the cytoplasmic accumulation of TC45. In the cytoplasm, TC45 down-regulates stress-induced signaling events including the activation of the EGF receptor and the MAPK JNK. Our results indicate that TC45 nuclear exit occurs by passive diffusion and that cellular stress-induced signaling pathways may act to inhibit TC45 nuclear import. The control of such signaling pathways would provide a means for achieving an acute regulation of TC45 localization and function in vivo. TC45 can regulate signal transduction events induced by receptor PTKs such as the EGF receptor at the cell surface. Hyperactivation of the EGF receptor is known to contribute to transformation and malignant progression of many human tumors. Therefore maintenance of TC45 in the cytoplasm may provide a means by which to suppress EGF receptor signaling in transformed cells. To this end we have focused on elucidating the processes involved in the control of TC45 subcellular localization. We have demonstrated that specific cellular stresses lead to the cytoplasmic accumulation of TC45. This change in localization of the phosphatase occurred in various cell types and was reversed when cellular stress was alleviated. As such, the events triggered by cellular stress can be regulated and may provide an important means for manipulating TC45 localization reversibly in vivo. Cellular stress may either stimulate nuclear export or inhibit nuclear import. A recent study has indicated that cellular stresses such as osmotic shock and H2O2 can induce the cytoplasmic accumulation of HIV Rev, whereas UV irradiation and heat shock have no effect (37Soros V. Cochrane A. Virology. 2001; 280: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the case of HIV Rev, it was concluded that cellular stress activated the CRM-1-mediated export of Rev (37Soros V. Cochrane A. Virology. 2001; 280: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that the TC45 nuclear import is an active process, as manifested by the apparently exclusive nuclear localization of the GFP-TC45 fusion protein that was too large to diffuse into the nucleus. In contrast, TC45 nuclear exit was independent of CRM-1 and occurred instead by passive diffusion. Accordingly, we propose that the stress-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of TC45 may result from an inhibition of TC45 nuclear import. Our previous studies indicate that TC45 nuclear import may occur via a novel mechanism (13Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas classical nuclear import is mediated by the direct interaction of importin α with SV40 T-antigen-like NLS motifs (31Ohno M. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1998; 92: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 32Nigg E.A.

In addition to this coupled uptake, these transporters also mediate a sodium- and glutamate-dependent uncoupled anion conductance. Most models assume that the initial steps for both processes are the same, leading to the anticipation that both may exhibit a similar requirement for cations. In this study we have tested this idea in the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC-1. We report that in this transporter lithium can replace sodium in the coupled uptake. Strikingly, the glutamate-dependent gating of the uncoupled conductance mediated by EAAC-1 has a strict requirement for sodium; lithium cannot substitute for it. Moreover, we describe two mutants, T370S and G410S, in which the cation selectivity of the two processes is affected differently. In both mutants sodium, but not lithium, can support coupled transport. On the other hand, the sodium selectivity of the gated anion conductance in oocytes expressing the mutant transporters is not affected. Our observations indicate that although both the coupled and the uncoupled fluxes are sodium-dependent, the conformation gating the anion conductance is different from that during substrate translocation.

In addition to this coupled flux, glutamate transporters mediate a thermodynamically uncoupled chloride flux, activated by two of the molecules they transport: sodium and glutamate (16Wadiche J.I.

The homology is significantly higher in the carboxyl-terminal half which has a non-conventional topology containing two reentrant loops, two transmembrane domains, 7 and 8, as well as an outward facing hydrophobic region (22Grunewald M.

Some of the features of the topology remain under debate as a different study assigns transmembrane domain 7 as a reentrant loop (25Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G.

Two adjacent amino acid residues of GLT-1 located in transmembrane domain 7 and conserved in all the other glutamate transporters, tyrosine 403 and glutamate 404, are required for potassium binding (15Kavanaugh M.P.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have suggested that this site may be formed by the invariant residues 396–400 (26Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Zarbiv R. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the studies described here we have attempted to find evidence for this idea by analyzing conservative mutations of these residues in EAAC-1 (20Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar), which has better functional expression inXenopus laevis oocytes than GLT-1. In this stretch, only mutant T370S (corresponding to position 400 of GLT-1) retained significant activity. The mutation causes a change in the selectivity for cations in coupled flux. During the in-depth study of the cation selectivity of transporter-mediated currents in the mutant and the wild type, we found that in wild type EAAC-1 the ion selectivity for the coupled flux is less stringent than that of the uncoupled chloride flux. This came as a surprise because in most models it is assumed that the sodium and glutamate binding steps for both processes are the same. Our observations indicate that the conformation gating the anion conductance is different from that during substrate translocation. Wild type EAAC-1 (20Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar) with nine histidines added (27Bendahan A. Armon A. Madani N. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). Briefly, the parent DNA was used to transform Escherichia coli CJ236 (dut−/−, ung−/−). From one of the transformants, single-stranded uracil containing DNA was isolated upon growth in a uridine-containing medium according to the standard protocol from Stratagene using helper phage R408. This yields the sense strand, and consequently the mutagenic primers were designed to be antisense. Mutagenic primers were designed to contain the desired mutation and a diagnostic restriction site. Restriction enzymesPinAI and PflMI were used to subclone the mutations into the construct containing the His-tagged wild type EAAC-1 in pOG2 (27Bendahan A. Armon A. Madani N. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The latter is an oocyte expression vector that contains a 5′-untranslated Xenopus β-globin sequence and a 3′-poly(A) signal. The coding and non-coding strands were sequenced between the above two restriction sites. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biological Industries, number 01-055-1A) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2% penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine and plated on 24-well plates (Nunc/Costar) 24–27 h prior to transient transfection. 75–90% confluent cells were incubated 30 min in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium using the recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus vTF7–3 (30Fuerst R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar) and then transfected with 0.5 µg of DNA/well using LipofectAMINE (2 µg/well) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Uptake was initiated ∼19 h after transfection, usingl-[2,3-3H]aspartic acid (ARC, St. Louis, number ART211, 32 Ci/mmol) at 2 µCi/ml uptake solution (in mm); NaCl 150, potassium Pi 5, MgSO4 0.5, CaCl2 0.3, pH 7.4. Endogenous HeLa cell uptake and effect of transfection was assayed by transfecting cells with the pBluescriptSK(−) vector alone. Cells were washed twice in 37 °C uptake solution containing choline chloride instead of NaCl before 200 µl/well radioactive uptake solution was added. Uptake was stopped after 10 min by removing the transport solution. Subsequently the cells were washed twice in cold sodium uptake solution before lysis by 1% SDS (500 µl/well) and transferal to scintillation vials. For dose-response experiments l-[2,3-3H]aspartic acid was supplemented with non-radioactive l-aspartate (prepared in equimolar Tris-OH), and NaCl was replaced by equimolar choline chloride or LiCl in NaCl titration experiments (data not shown). Capped run-off cRNA transcripts were made from transporter constructs in pOG2 linearized withSacI using mMessage mMachine (Ambion). Oocytes were removed from anesthetized X. laevis frogs and treated with collagenase (type1A, Sigma number C-9891) until capillaries were absent and injected with 50 nl of diluted or undiluted cRNA the same or the next day. Oocytes were maintained in modified Barth's saline (in mm); NaCl 88, KCl 1, MgSO4 1, NaHCO3 2.4, CaCl2 1, Ca(NO3)2 0.3, HEPES 10, pH 7.5, with freshly added sodium pyruvic acid 2, and theophylline 0.5 and supplemented with 10000 units/l penicillin, 10 mg/l streptomycin, 50 mg/l gentamicin. Oocytes were placed in the recording chamber, penetrated with two micropipettes (backfilled with 2 m KCl, resistance varied between 0.5 and 2 MΩ), and voltage clamped using GeneClamp 500 (Axon Instruments) and digitized using Digidata 1200A (Axon Instruments) both controlled with the pClamp6 suite (Axon Instruments). Currents were acquired with Clampex6.03 at 10 kHz every 2 ms. Oocytes were stepped from −100 mV to +40 mV in +10 mV increments, using −25 mV as holding potential. Each potential was held clamped for 250 ms. The membrane potential was measured relative to an extracellular Ag/AgCl electrode in the recording chamber. Penetrated oocytes were gravity-perfused with Ringer buffer (in mm): NaCl 130, KCl 2.5, CaCl2 1.8, MgCl2 1.0, HEPES/Tris 1, pH 7.4. NaCl was replaced with equimolar LiCl or choline chloride in dose-response experiments. For thiocyanate experiments: 2.5 mm KCl was replaced with 20 mm KSCN, and the 130 mm NaCl was replaced with either 110 mm NaCl, 110 mm choline chloride, or 110 mm LiCl (NaSCN, LiSCN, or choline thiocyanate Ringers, respectively). In these experiments, the extracellular Ag/AgCl electrode was placed in 2 m KCl and connected with an agar/2 m KCl bridge into the recording chamber. Steady-state net currents (defined as (Ibuffer+Lasp)-(Ibuffer)) were analyzed using Clampfit6.05 and Origin6.1 (Microcal). Unless stated otherwise oocytes were perfused in Ringer ± 300 µml-aspartate (Sigma, A-8949, 0.5 m stock made in Tris-OH buffer). For uptake, five oocytes were pre-equilibrated for 5 min in Ringer and transferred to 500 µl of Ringer with 62 nml-[2,3-3H]aspartic acid (32 Ci/mmol), and the uptake was stopped after 20 min by washing the oocytes several times in Ringer. The oocytes were then transferred to scintillation vials and lysed with 1% SDS, and scintillation fluid was added. Radioactive decay was measured by scintillation counting (Kontron Instruments). We found that the relation between oocyte survival and cRNA concentration was always inversely proportional. Dilutions of cRNA were injected to increase the survival, with the result of lower expression. Therefore, data have been normalized when appropriate. The expression level in oocytes, as assayed by uptake or currents, peaked at days 4–7. In the experiments involving dependence of the net current on the substrate concentration (sodium orl-aspartate), we have displayed for clarity the results obtained at two voltages: −60 and −100 mV. Data points were connected by lines drawn with parameters determined from fitting net currents (I) to Equation 1, I=Imax·[S]nKmn+[S]nEquation 1 with S representing Na+ or l-aspartate. Imax (maximum current) was fixed and Km andn were allowed to vary. In Fig. 7B the data were fitted using a two-site independent model defined by Equation 2, I=Imax1·[L−Asp]Km1+[L−Asp]+Imax2·[L−Asp]Km2+[L−Asp]Equation 2 with a fixed Imax1 and Imax2 for each individual oocyte and defining Imax1 as the current at 100 µml-aspartate and Imax2 as the difference between the current obtained at 5 mml-aspartate and Imax1. The stretch Asp366-Met-Asp-Gly-Thr370 (EAAC-1 numbering) is conserved in all eukaryotic sodium-coupled glutamate transporters. This stretch has been implicated to be important for the interaction of the transporters with sodium (26Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Zarbiv R. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As a first step to examine this idea, we have made conservative substitutions at each of these positions and examined the sodium-dependentl-[3H]aspartate transport of the mutant transporters transiently expressed in HeLa cells (Fig.1). The mutant in which threonine-370 is replaced by serine, T370S, exhibits significant transport, around 50% of that of the wild type (Fig. 1). Threonine 370 is important for expression of transport because no detectable activity is observed when it is replaced by alanine (T370A, Fig. 1), and the same is true for the corresponding threonine residue in the GLT-1 transporter (replacements to alanine, cysteine, or asparagine, data not shown). Asparagine 366 is also essential as judged from the lack of activity of the N366D and N366Q mutants, and the same is true for asparagine 368 (Fig. 1). The corresponding aspartate is also essential for functional expression in GLT-1 (28Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Very low transport is observed in replacement mutants of methionine 367 and glycine 369 (Fig. 1). To compare the cation dependence of the uptake of l-[3H]aspartate by wild type and the T370S mutant with that of their respective transporter-associated currents, cRNA was prepared and injected inX. laevis oocytes. Although uptake ofl-[3H]aspartate by wild type EAAC-1 is sodium-dependent, also lithium can support considerable uptake (Fig. 2). A strikingly different situation is observed in the T370S mutant. Here only sodium, but not lithium, supports the uptake (Fig. 2). In both cases uptake obtained in choline media was indistinguishable from those with uninjected oocytes (data not shown). Although not shown, similar data are observed whend-[3H]aspartate orl-[3H]glutamate uptake are compared between wild type and mutant, except that the ratio of uptake in the wild type in lithium versus sodium ranged between 15–30% rather than around the 50% observed with l-aspartate. A similar change in cation ion selectivity is observed when uptake is measured in HeLa cells (data not shown). A similar cation selectivity change in the mutant is observed when transporter currents are recorded from the oocytes (Fig.3). Thus, l-aspartate-induced currents are observed in the wild type both in sodium- and lithium-containing media (Fig. 3A). However, in the T370S mutant transporter currents are observed only in sodium-containing media (Fig. 3B). It is well established that uptake of excitatory amino acids by all cloned glutamate transporters thus far characterized, results in the activation of a current reflecting the sum of two currents. The first is a non-reversing inward rectifying current (reflecting the coupled cycle), whereas the second is a reversing non-rectifying anion current that is thermodynamically uncoupled (16Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar,17Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 21Arriza J.L. Eliasof S. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4155-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Indeed, in sodium-containing media, the currents induced byl-aspartate in wild type EAAC-1 reverse around 0 mV (Fig.3A). Moreover, in experiments where part of the external chloride (20 mm) is substituted by thiocyanate, larger outward currents are observed that reverse at more negative potentials (around −25 mV, Fig. 4A). The latter anion has a much higher permeability (≈70-fold) than chloride (16Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 31Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, in lithium-containing media no reversal of the current is seen in the absence (Fig. 3A) or presence of external thiocyanate (Fig. 4A). It appears therefore that while sodium and lithium can both supportl-[3H]aspartate uptake as well as the coupled current in wild type EAAC-1, the l-aspartate-induced anion conductance is only observed in sodium. Thus, in the T370S mutant where lithium cannot support the coupled uptake, nol-aspartate-induced currents are observed in the presence of this cation, neither in the absence (Fig. 3B) nor the presence of thiocyanate (Fig. 4B). The responses observed with the mutant in lithium are indistinguishable from those obtained in the presence of the inert choline (Figs. 3B and4B). The l-aspartate-induced currents in T370S do not reverse in chloride-containing media —at least up to +40 mV (Fig. 3B). This indicates that the anion conductance is lower in this mutant but not necessarily absent. Since the current observed is the sum of the contributions of the coupled and uncoupled fluxes, it is possible that at +40 mV, T370S exhibits a small outward current (due to the entry of chloride), but it is masked by a coupled inward current of almost the same size. The same measurements done in the presence of the highly permeant thiocyanate anion show that the anion conductance pathway indeed exists as current reversal is observed in sodium media (Fig. 4B). To examine if the mutation has changed the affinity of the transporter for sodium in addition to its change in selectivity, transport currents of wild type and mutant have been compared at varying extracellular sodium concentrations (choline substitution, Fig. 5,A and B). In the wild type saturation at around 100 mm sodium is observed with a half-maximal activation at 18 ± 0.3 mm at −100 mV and 13 ± 2.5 mm at −60 mV (n = 3) (Eq. 1) (Fig. 5A). The process appears to be cooperative with a Hill number of 1.6 ± 0.1 at both holding potentials. In the mutant no saturation is observed in the entire range in which these experiments are feasible, 0–130 mm sodium (Fig. 5B). At around 50 mmsodium approximately half the current of that measured at 130 mm is observed (Fig. 5B). When lithium is used as a sodium substituent rather than choline, the increment in current observed in the wild type behaves as a rectangular hyperbola with a half-maximal activation between 5–10 mmsodium (Fig. 6A). Again, in contrast to wild type (Fig. 6A), no saturation is achieved in T370S at concentrations as high as 130 mm sodium (Fig.6B). Thus, in the mutant the activation curve by sodium is similar regardless whether choline (Fig. 5B) or lithium (Fig. 6B) is used as a substituent. When the lithium concentration dependence is monitored in the wild type in the absence of sodium (choline substitution) a sigmoid behavior is observed (data not shown). The concentration dependence of the wild type currents onl-aspartate is shown in Fig.7A. In the wild type the apparent affinity is around 10 µm and is almost voltage independent: 14 ± 1 µm at −60 mV, 11 ± 0.5 µm at −100 mV (n = 3). This independence of the apparent Km on the membrane potential agrees well with previous studies by others (32Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Hebert S.C. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16561-16568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 33Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In the T370S mutant the curve can be fitted by two independent components (Eq. 2): one of high affinity similar to that of the wild type and another with an apparentKm of 1120 ± 50 µm (−60 mV,n = 3) and 1270 ± 20 µm (−100 mV,n = 3), assuming saturation at 5 mml-aspartate. We have observed that the apparent affinity constants of l-[3H]aspartate uptake (tested up to 120 µm) are similar in wild type, 18.7 ± 0.9 µm and T370S mutant, 21.7 ± 0.9 µm(n = 3). Thus it appears likely that the low-affinity component of the current observed in the mutant is due to that of the uncoupled current. The ability of lithium to support radioactive substrate flux in wild type EAAC-1 is intriguing, since we have documented that in the astroglial glutamate transporter, GLT-1, only sodium is capable of doing so (34Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Strikingly, mutation of serine 440 of GLT-1 to glycine, the residue occupying this position in the other glutamate transporters, caused a broadening of the sodium selectivity for electrogenic acidic amino acid uptake (34Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the reverse also could be true, mutation of this glycine in EAAC-1 to serine (G410S) might confer the phenotype of GLT-1, a stringent sodium specificity, upon EAAC-1. The data presented in Fig. 8indicate that this idea indeed is correct. Similar to the data with the T370S mutant,l-aspartate-induced currents, with or without thiocyanate, are observed only in sodium and not in lithium media (Fig. 8). This selectivity change is also observed with fluxes ofl-[3H]glutamate andl-[3H]aspartate in this mutant (data not shown). Our results show that in wild type EAAC-1 lithium can substitute for sodium in the coupled uptake (Fig. 2) and current (Fig.3A) but not in the substrate-gated anion conductance (Figs.3A and 4A). This more stringent sodium requirement for activating the anion current indicates that at least one of the steps in this gating process is not shared with those leading to sodium-coupled glutamate/aspartate translocation. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that in two mutants, T370S and G410S, the sodium/lithium selectivity ratio of the transport mode is changed, whereas that of the anion-conducting mode is not (Figs. 2, 3,4, and 8). Our observations are in harmony with kinetic experiments that indicate that the onset of the uncoupled current is delayed compared with that of the coupled current (35Otis T.S. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2749-2757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Grewer C. Watzke N. Wiessner M. Rauen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9706-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 37Auger C. Attwell D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 547-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and also with the different pH profiles of these two currents (38Watzke N. Rauen T. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Possible interrelationships of the coupled and uncoupled fluxes are shown in Fig. 9. The sodium-coupled glutamate translocation, with the participating potassium ion and proton omitted for simplicity, is represented by steps 1–4 (Fig. 9, C = Na). After binding of sodium and glutamate on the extracellular side (step 1), the translocation complex is formed. After translocation (step 2), the substrates are released on the intracellular side (step 3). The unloaded transporter binds potassium (not shown) and after translocation to the outside (step 4), potassium is released and the transporter is ready to start a new cycle. Because the very substrates that are transported also gate the anion conductance, most models (35Otis T.S. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2749-2757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Grewer C.

Neuron. 2000; 28: 547-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) propose a transition step of the outward facing substrate loaded transporter to an anion-conducting state (Fig. 9,outT*3Na, Glu). However, our data indicate that for the gating of the anion conductance, at least one of the sodium ions cannot be replaced by lithium (Fig. 9). On the other hand, in the translocation cycle of EAAC-1 all three sodium ions are promiscuous, lithium can replace them (Figs. 2 and 3), and this is visualized in Fig. 9 (C = Li, steps 1–4). It is important to note that the functional knowledge of the coupled and uncoupled fluxes is not paralleled by structural insights, especially in the case of the uncoupled process. It has been suggested that the same translocation pathway may be used for both processes (16Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), but an alternative speculation is that the coupled flux occurs within a glutamate transporter monomer, whereas the anion conducting pathway is formed in the space between the monomers in a pentameric structure (39Eskandari S. Kreman M. Kavanaugh M.P. Wright E.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 95: 8641-8646Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that mutants T370S and G410S both exhibit a reduced anion permeability (Figs. 3, 4, and 8). This suggests a link between the way sodium is bound to the transporter and the gating of the anion conductance, although the molecular basis for this is unclear at present. Regarding the coupled cycle, it is of interest to note that the sodium selectivity of EAAC-1 is different from that of GLT-1. In the latter, lithium cannot replace sodium and this is apparently because one of the three sodium ions cannot be substituted by lithium (34Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mutation of a single serine to glycine, this latter residue occupies the position of serine 440 in all other eukaryotic glutamate transporters, leads to a broadened sodium selectivity; the “specific” sodium site can now also accept lithium (34Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Further evidence for this idea is provided by the fact that, in the “reverse mutant” G410S-EAAC-1, lithium cannot replace sodium in supporting the coupled flux (Fig. 8). Unlike wild type EAAC-1, where lithium by itself can sustain steps 1–3 (Fig. 9), this is no longer true for G410S-EAAC-1, which has become similar to GLT-1 in this regard. Since three sodium ions are translocated in each cycle, other residues involved in their binding should be identifiable. One such residue is threonine 370. In the T370S mutant only sodium, but not lithium, can support the translocation cycle (Figs. 2 and 3). Since multiple residues far away in the primary sequence but close in space may ligand a single sodium ion, it is not clear if threonine 370 and glycine 410 control the specificity of the same or different sodium ion binding sites. The residue(s) involved in liganding the third sodium ion are yet to be identified. Possible candidates are the essential asparagine 366 and aspartate 368 (Fig. 1) as well as essential aspartate residues in transmembrane domain 8 (28Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 40Slotboom D.J. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Asparagine 366 and aspartate 368 would be close, at least in the primary structure, to threonine 370. But this does not rule out the possibility that they may be involved in the binding of separate sodium ions. Examination of the high resolution structure of the Ca2+-ATPase reveals that even a single aspartate residue can participate in the simultaneous liganding of two calcium ions (41Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). Further information on the interrelationship of residues controlling sodium selectivity will require information on the transporter's tertiary structure. In fact, we are now probing distances between various domains of the glutamate transporters by engineering pairs of cysteines and studying the impact of their oxidative cross-linking on transporter function. 1L.

https://openalex.org/W1530449641,"ADARs are adenosine deaminases responsible for RNA-editing reactions that occur within duplex RNA. Currently little is known regarding the nature of the protein-RNA interactions that lead to site-selective adenosine deamination. We previously reported that ADAR2 induced changes in 2-aminopurine fluorescence of a modified substrate, consistent with a base-flipping mechanism. Additional data have been obtained using full-length ADAR2 and a protein comprising only the RNA binding domain (RBD) of ADAR2. The increase in 2-aminopurine fluorescence is specific to the editing site and dependent on the presence of the catalytic domain. Hydroxyl radical footprinting demonstrates that the RBD protects a region of the RNA duplex around the editing site, suggesting a significant role for the RBD in identifying potential ADAR2 editing sites. Nucleotides near the editing site on the non-edited strand become hypersensitive to hydrolytic cleavage upon binding of ADAR2 RBD. Therefore, the RBD may assist base flipping by increasing the conformational flexibility of nucleotides in the duplex adjacent to its binding site. In addition, an increase in tryptophan fluorescence is observed when ADAR2 binds duplex RNA, suggesting a conformational change in the catalytic domain of the enzyme. Furthermore, acrylamide quenching experiments indicate that RNA binding creates heterogeneity in the solvent accessibility of ADAR2 tryptophan residues, with one out of five tryptophans more solvent-accessible in the ADAR2·RNA complex.

RNA binding domain adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA double-stranded RNA binding motif RNA-dependent protein kinase 2-aminopurine glutathioneS-transferase dithiothreitol double-stranded single-stranded RNA editing is a term used to describe the structural alteration, insertion, or deletion of nucleotides in RNA that changes its coding properties (1Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998: 551-553Google Scholar). If the modification occurs in messenger RNA (mRNA), it can result in the translation of a protein sequence different from that predicted by the DNA sequence of the gene. Thus, this process plays an important role in creating functional diversity in the protein products of gene expression. Processing of the mRNA for mammalian GluR-B, a subunit of a glutamate-gated ion channel, involves editing reactions where genomically encoded sequences are altered in the pre-mRNA by adenosine deamination (2Higuchi M. Single F.N. Kohler M. Sommer B. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The deamination of adenosine (A) in the mRNA results in inosine (I) at that position. Because inosine is translated as guanosine (G), the editing reaction causes a functional A to G replacement. For example, the R/G-editing site of the GluR-B pre-mRNA is located in an arginine codon that is converted to a sequence that encodes for glycine. Receptors assembled with edited GluR-B subunits have been shown to recover from desensitization faster than receptors with arginine at this position (3Lomeli H. Mosbacher J. Melcher T. Hoger T.

The dsRBM is found in a number of double-stranded RNA-binding proteins such as PKR (the RNA-dependent protein kinase) and staufen (aDrosophila RNA trafficking protein) (8Fierro-Monti I. Mathews M.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 241-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Consistent with the presence of dsRBMs in ADAR2, duplex RNA secondary structure in the substrate is a requirement for the ADAR2-catalyzed reaction. In the case of the R/G-editing site of the GluR-B pre-mRNA, this duplex is formed by the base-pairing of nucleotides at the 3′ end of exon 13 and editing site complementary sequence found in intron 13 (3). C-terminal to the dsRBMs in ADAR2, amino acid sequences have been identified that may comprise the deamination active site (9Lai F. Drakas R. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17098-17105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 10Hough R.F. Bass B.L. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 356-370PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleoside deaminases such as adenosine deaminase (ADA) and cytidine deaminase have been extensively characterized structurally and mechanistically (11Carter Jr., C.W. Biochemie (Paris). 1995; 77: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The reactivity of substrate analogs implies that the deamination steps in the reaction mechanism for ADARs are similar to those found for the nucleoside deaminases (12Easterwood L.M. Veliz E.A. Beal P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 11537-11538Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). One major difference between the nucleoside deaminases and the ADARs is the requirement for duplex RNA structure in the ADAR substrate (13Polson A.G. Crain P.F. Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Bass B.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11507-11514Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The necessary trajectory of an attacking water molecule for hydrolytic deamination of adenosine makes it likely that the reactive nucleotide is flipped out of the duplex during reaction. Indeed, the fluorescence changes that occur when ADAR2 binds a 2-aminopurine-modified substrate are consistent with a base-flipping mechanism for this enzyme (14Stephens O.M. Yi-Brunozzi H.Y. Beal P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12243-12251Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this work, we describe experiments using R/G-editing site analogs derived from the GluR-B pre-mRNA in complex with full-length ADAR2 or the isolated RBD. These experiments demonstrate that the RBD has a specificity and affinity for duplex RNA similar to that of the full-length enzyme but cannot induce the structural change that leads to an increase in 2-aminopurine (2-AP) fluorescence. Furthermore, we observe a protein-dependent sensitivity to hydrolytic cleavage at nucleotides on the strand opposite the targeted adenosine, indicative of an increase in conformational flexibility of the RNA upon binding of the RBD. This is the first study to suggest that the RBD of an ADAR alters the conformational dynamics of the RNA, indicating that this part of the protein plays more than just a recognition role in the ADAR2-editing reaction. Finally, analysis of the ADAR2 tryptophan fluorescence in the presence and absence of RNA indicates the protein undergoes conformational changes upon substrate binding. Acrylamide quenching suggests one of the five tryptophans in the catalytic domain is more exposed in the protein·RNA complex. These studies begin to shed light on the complex conformational changes that occur in both the protein and RNA during the RNA-editing adenosine deaminase reaction. Distilled, deionized water was used for all aqueous reactions and dilutions. Biochemical reagents were obtained from Sigma/Aldrich unless otherwise noted. Common enzymes were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals or New England Biolabs. Oligonucleotides were prepared on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/ABI model 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer with β-cyanoethylphosphoramidites. Protected adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, uridine, and 2-aminopurine ribonucleoside phosphoramidites were purchased from Glen Research. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and [5′-32P]pCp (cytidine 3′,5′-bisphosphate) (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Storage phosphor autoradiography was carried out using imaging plates obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. A Molecular Dynamics STORM 840 was used to obtain all data from phosphorimaging plates. Liquid scintillation counting was carried out with a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter and Bio-Safe II mixture from Research Products International Corp. PKR RBD was overexpressed in bacteria using pGEX-(His)6-RBD and has been described previously (15Vuyisich M. Beal P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2369-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Full-length ADAR2 was overexpressed inSaccharomyces cerevisiae using the plasmid pScE[hA2a-His6] containing the human ADAR2 gene under the transcriptional control of a galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. This expression system and the purification protocol employed were developed by Herbert L. Ley III and Prof. Brenda Bass, Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Utah (16Ley III, H.L. Editing of Hepatitis Delta Virus Antigenomic RNA by Recombinant Human Adenosine Deaminases That Act on RNA. Ph.D. thesis. University of Utah, 2001Google Scholar). The human ADAR2 RBD (amino acids 71–316) was obtained as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein by expression in Escherichia coli using derivatives of the bacterial expression plasmid pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This fragment contains both dsRBMs and the intervening sequence (17Yang C.-C. Sklar P. Axel R. Maniatis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4354-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The following primers were used to amplify the RBD-coding sequence using the plasmid pScE[hA2a-His6] as template (16Ley III, H.L. Editing of Hepatitis Delta Virus Antigenomic RNA by Recombinant Human Adenosine Deaminases That Act on RNA. Ph.D. thesis. University of Utah, 2001Google Scholar): 5′ primer, 5′-GCGTGAggatccAGGAAAACACCAGGGCCCGTC-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-TCACGCggtaccTTACTGAAGACCCTCACTGGGAAT-3′. Lowercase letters represent incorporated restriction sites (ADAR2 RBD template 5′ primerBamHI and 3′ primer KpnI). BL-21 E. coli (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) cells were transformed with the ADAR2 RBD expression plasmid. A 5-ml overnight culture was used to inoculate 500 ml of media containing 16 g of bactotryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 2.5 g of sodium chloride, 1 mm zinc sulfate, and 60 μg of ampicillin at 37 °C. The culture was grown to an A600 between 0.5 and 0.6, at which point isopropylthiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 20 μm. The induced culture was grown for an additional 20 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 25 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, and 100 μg/ml lysozyme. The cell suspension was frozen at −80 °C followed by thawing at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were then lysed two times at 12,000 p.s.i. using a French pressure cell (Carver). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The clarified lysate was incubated with 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 h at 4 °C. Unbound proteins were removed by 2 × 20 ml and 5 × 1 ml washes containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The affinity matrix with bound GST-RBD was equilibrated with thrombin cleavage buffer (120 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.6, 150 mm NaCl, 7 mmCaCl2). The GST domain of the fusion protein was removed by cleaving with 0.5 units of thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); the cleavage reaction was allowed to proceed for 18 h at 4 °C. Thrombin cleavage results in a protein with the sequence NH2-GS(human ADAR2 (71))-COOH. To remove thrombin from the ADAR2 RBD, the supernatant was incubated with 600 μl of benzamidine-Sepharose 6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl. The supernatant was removed after 1 h of incubation at 4 °C. The matrix was washed with the above buffer, and the supernatants were combined. The purified protein was loaded into a 10,000-Da molecular mass cut-off Slide-A-Lyzer cassette (Pierce) and dialyzed overnight into 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm NaCl. The purity of the ADAR2 RBD was estimated to be >95% based on analysis by Coomassie Blue-stained protein gels. A standard curve for protein concentration was generated by resolving known amounts of bovine serum albumin on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel, visualizing the band by SyproOrange (Bio-Rad) staining, and quantifying the band intensities with a Molecular Dynamics STORM 840 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. All protein samples were separated into aliquots in 20–30-μl fractions and stored at −20 °C. Deprotection of synthetic oligoribonucleotides was carried out in 10 mCH3NH2 for 6 h at 35 °C followed by 0.1m tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran for 8 h at 35 °C and desalted on Nap-10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Deprotected oligonucleotides were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, visualized by UV shadowing, and extracted from the gel by the crush and soak method with 0.5 mNH4OAc, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA. Extinction coefficients for absorbance at 260 nm for the RNAs were calculated as the sum of the extinction coefficients of the component nucleotides using 1000 cm−1·M−1 for 2-AP. A known amount of an oligonucleotide containing the 2-AP modification and a 1.5-fold excess of the complementary strand in 15 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.003% Nonidet P-40, 0.3 mm DTT was heated at 85 °C and allowed to slow cool for 2.5 h until it reached room temperature for fluorescence experiments. For the formation of labeled duplex RNA, a given oligonucleotide was labeled at the 5′ end using [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase or at the 3′ end using [5′-32P]pCp (3000 Ci/mmol) and T4 RNA ligase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP or [5′-32P]pCp was removed using a Microspin G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The labeled strand was first purified on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, excised, and extracted before it was hybridized to the unlabeled complement in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA) with 50 mm NaCl. The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 5 min and allowed to slow cool to room temperature. The duplex was purified on a 16% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The appropriate band was visualized by storage phosphor autoradiography, excised, and extracted into TE buffer overnight at room temperature. Polyacrylamide particles were removed using a Spin-X (Costar) centrifuge column. The RNA duplex was ethanol-precipitated, redissolved in deionized water, and stored at −20 °C. The concentration was determined using scintillation counting and the specific activity of the labeled strand. Varying amounts of protein, 25 nm duplex RNA, and 1 μg/ml yeast tRNAPhe in 6.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 27 mm KCl, 0.001% Nonidet P-40 were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C before final concentrations of 1.5 mm EDTA·Fe, 20 mmsodium ascorbate, and 0.3% H2O2 were added (20-μl final reaction volume). The cleavage reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched with 5 μl of a solution containing 50% glycerol and 1 mm EDTA. The RNA was extracted with phenol and chloroform and precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol. The precipitated RNA was washed with 70 and 90% ethanol then denatured at 95 °C in 95% formamide and separated by electrophoresis on 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (29:1). Storage phosphorimaging plates were pressed flat against the polyacrylamide gels and exposed overnight. The cleavage data were analyzed and quantified using ImageQuant software. Varying amounts of protein, 25 nm duplex RNA, and 1 μg/ml yeast tRNAPhewere incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in 6.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 or pH 9, 27 mm KCl, 0.001% Nonidet P-40. The final volume for each reaction was brought to 20 μl, and incubation proceeded for an additional 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction products were treated as described above for EDTA·Fe cleavage experiments. Fluorescence measurements were performed utilizing an Instruments S. A., Inc., Fluorolog-3 spectrophotometer. Excitation was at 310 nm, and the fluorescence emission was scanned from 335 to 430 nm for 2-AP-containing RNAs. Spectra were obtained for solutions containing 0.8 μmRNA, with increasing amounts of ADAR2 in 36 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 7% glycerol, 142 mm KCl, 3.6 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.7 mm DTT at room temperature. The fluorescence spectrum of the reaction buffer and enzyme was obtained and subtracted as background from all reactions. Slit widths of 5.0 nm were used for excitation and emission in all experiments. For the detection of tryptophan fluorescence, the excitation was at 295 nm, and the fluorescence emission was scanned from 330 to 355 nm. Spectra were obtained for solutions containing 400 nm ADAR2, with increasing concentrations of RNA. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching experiments with acrylamide were carried out by monitoring the change in the intensity at the emission maximum with increasing amounts of acrylamide. Fluorescence quenching data were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation (Equation 1) (18Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar),Fo/F=1+KSV[Q]Equation 1 where Ksv is the collisional Stern-Volmer constant, and Fo and F are the fluorescence intensities of ADAR2 in the absence and presence of duplex RNA, respectively. [Q] is the acrylamide concentration. A plot of Fo/Fversus [Q] yields a linear plot for homogeneous fluorescence emitters. A downward curvature of the Stern-Volmer plot indicates a heterogeneous population, i.e. only a fraction of the tryptophans is accessible to the quencher (19Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Klumer Academics/Plenum Press, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). The fraction of the initial fluorescence accessible to the quencher can be determined by using a modified Stern-Volmer equation (Equation 2),Fo/(FO−F)=1/{[Q]faKQ}+1/faEquation 2 where fa is the fraction of the fluorophores accessible to quencher, and KQ is the quenching constant. The plot of Fo/(Fo − F)versus 1/[Q] is linear, and the yintercept = 1/fa, whereas the slope = 1/faKQ. To determine the dissociation constant (Kd) for ADAR2 RBD binding to the GluR-B duplex, varying amounts of RBD were added to 50 pm5′-32P end-labeled duplex in 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.003% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm DTT and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. To simulate conditions employed in the fluorescence experiments, binding reactions were carried out by combining 0.8 μm 5′-32P end-labeled RNA duplex with varying concentrations of protein in 36 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 7% glycerol, 142 mm KCl, 3.6 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.7 mm DTT and allowing the mixture to incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Samples were then loaded onto a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (79:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) and electrophoresed in 0.5× Tris-borate EDTA at 4 °C. Samples were loaded onto the gel while constant voltage was applied. Storage phosphorimaging plates were pressed flat against the polyacrylamide gels for exposure. The data were analyzed by performing volume integrations of the regions corresponding to free RNA, the ADAR2·RNA or RBD· RNA complex using the ImageQuant software. For the determination of dissociation constants, the data were fit to Equation 3 using the least-squares method of KaleidaGraph.Fraction bound=[RBD]/([RBD]+Kd)Equation 3 We demonstrated previously that when ADAR2 bound a duplex with 2-AP located at a position corresponding to the R/G-editing site of GluR-B pre-mRNA, the fluorescence emission maximum shifted 14 nm, and the intensity increased ∼3.5-fold (14Stephens O.M. Yi-Brunozzi H.Y. Beal P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12243-12251Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This is consistent with ADAR2 flipping out the reactive nucleotide into a binding pocket similar in nature to that of the adenine N6 DNA methyltransferases (20Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 21Goedecke K. Pignot M. Goody R.S. Scheidig A.J. Weinhold E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To further define the structural features of the protein responsible for this effect, we carried out similar experiments using the isolated RBD of ADAR2 lacking the catalytic domain. ADAR2 RBD is defined here as the protein sequence that includes both dsRBMs and the intervening linker sequence (Fig. 1). For these experiments, we expressed a protein corresponding in sequence to human ADAR2 amino acids 71–316 as a GST fusion in E. coli. For analysis of the properties of the RBD, the GST domain was removed by specific proteolysis with thrombin. Gel mobility shift assays were performed to determine the dissociation constant (Kd) for binding to a substrate model of the GluR-B R/G site (DS R/G) (Fig.1). The binding affinity of the RBD for this RNA (Kd= 12 ± 2 nm) was found to be similar to that previously determined for full-length ADAR2 (Kd = 22 ± 4 nm) (Fig. 2, A andB) (14Stephens O.M. Yi-Brunozzi H.Y. Beal P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12243-12251Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Figure 2A, quantitative gel mobility shift analysis of the binding of RBD to the DS R/G duplex. Shown is the storage phosphor autoradiogram of the gel used to separate bound from free RNA; lanes 1–12: 0, 0.1, 0.4, 0.7, 1.6, 5.0, 14, 43, 86, 129, 172, and 387 nm RBD added. B, plot of the fraction RNA bound as a function of RBD concentration. The data were fit to the equation, fraction bound = [RBD]/([RBD] +Kd), using the least squares method of KaleidaGraph. Data points reported are the average ± S.D. for three independent experiments. C, hydroxyl radical cleavage of the 5′ end-labeled 2-AP-containing strand of 25 nm DS R/G 2-AP was investigated in the presence of increasing amounts of RBD.

D, mapping of the protection of the duplex in the presence of RBD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if ADAR2 RBD bound the RNA with any selectivity, we used EDTA·Fe to generate a hydroxyl radical footprint for this protein bound to the R/G site duplex. Previously, full-length rat ADAR2 was shown to protect a region of 16 nucleotides surrounding the R/G site using ribonuclease V1 footprinting (22Ohman M. Kallman A.M. Bass B.L. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We observe a region of protection ∼13 nucleotides in length (U3-G15) on the edited strand near the editing site (Fig. 2, C and D). We also observe protection of over ∼10 nucleotides on the non-edited strand (data not shown). Therefore, the RBD displays selective binding around the editing site on this duplex. The binding site observed here for ADAR2 RBD is similar to that detected for full-length rat ADAR2 and has been confirmed using affinity cleavage experiments with EDTA·Fe-modified RBD (22Ohman M. Kallman A.M. Bass B.L. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 2O. M. Stephens and P. A. Beal, manuscript in preparation.Interestingly, while carrying out footprinting experiments with ADAR2 RBD using a duplex with the non-edited strand labeled, we observed a protein-dependent hyperreactivity of nucleotides near the editing site (see below). In addition to protection from cleavage by hydroxyl radical on the non-edited strand, we observed that some nucleotides on this strand near the editing site became hyperreactive in the presence of ADAR2 RBD (Fig. 3). This cleavage reaction is hydrolytic as it was not dependent on the presence of EDTA·Fe, was accelerated at higher pH, and the products comigrated with the products of RNase T1 and alkaline hydrolysis (for both 5′ and 3′ end-labeled RNA). This protein-induced hypersensitivity to hydrolytic cleavage is site-selective, as the cleavage sites were only present on the non-edited strand in a region near the edited adenosine and not found at any other site on the duplex (Fig. 3, B andC). Furthermore, this effect is specific to ADAR2 RBD, as the RNA binding domain from a different member of the dsRBM protein family, the RNA-dependent protein kinase, expressed and purified via similar methods as the ADAR2 RBD, did not induce the hyperreactivity (Fig. 3C). 2-AP is a fluorescent adenosine analog whose quantum yields and emission λmax are sensitive to its electronic environment (23Ward D.C. Reich E. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1228-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single-stranded oligonucleotides containing 2-AP are highly fluorescent; however, when present in a base-paired duplex, the 2-AP fluorescence is quenched. Together, these properties have made 2-AP a useful probe for the base-flipping step in the reactions of nucleic acid-modifying enzymes (20Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Stivers J.T. Pankiewicz K.W. Watanabe K.A.

When full-length human ADAR2 is added to duplex RNA with 2-AP at the R/G-editing site, the measured fluorescence intensity increases (14Stephens O.M. Yi-Brunozzi H.Y. Beal P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12243-12251Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensities observed when various concentrations of ADAR2 were added to a solution of 0.8 μm DS R/G 2-AP are shown in Fig.4A. Also plotted is the fractional saturation of the RNA by the protein under the same conditions measured by a gel shift assay. As can be seen from this analysis, the observed increase in fluorescence intensity correlates with RNA binding, with the maximum intensity occurring when the RNA is maximally bound. When 1.8 μm ADAR2 was added to 0.8 μm DS R/G 2-AP, the emission intensity increased 4.2-fold, and the emission maximum shifted to 359 nm as reported previously (Fig. 4, A and B) (14Stephens O.M. Yi-Brunozzi H.Y. Beal P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12243-12251Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To determine if these fluorescence changes were localized to the editing site, the concentration of ADAR2 that gave the maximum fluorescence change with the DS R/G 2-AP substrate was used with substrates DS G-7 2-AP and DS A-24 2-AP, where the 2-AP is located at nucleotide positions not modified by the enzyme (Fig. 1A). When ADAR2 was added to these other modified substrates, little change in the 2-AP fluorescence was detected (Fig. 4B). The change observed with these substrates was similar to that observed with single-stranded RNA with 2-AP at the R/G-editing site (SS R/G 2-AP). Importantly, when ADAR2 RBD was added to these various RNAs, little change in fluorescence was observed. To ensure that this was not due to differences in binding, gel mobility shift assays were performed under the conditions of the fluorescence measurements (Fig. 4C). We found that the fractional saturation of 2-AP modified RNA by various concentrations of RBD was similar to that observed for full-length ADAR2 (Fig.4C). Therefore, even though ADAR2 RBD is capable of high affinity and selective binding to the RNA duplex, it cannot i"
https://openalex.org/W2005247350,"We used published peptide library data to identify PDZ recognition sequences in integrin α subunit cytoplasmic domains and found that the α6A and α5subunits contain a type I PDZ binding site (TSDA*) (asterisk indicates the stop codon). The α6A cytoplasmic domain was used for screening a two-hybrid library to find interacting proteins. The bulk of the captured cDNAs (60%) coded for TIP-2/GIPC, a cytoplasmic protein with one PDZ domain. The interaction of TIP-2/GIPC with different integrin subunits was tested in two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays. Surprisingly, TIP-2/GIPC bound strongly to the C terminus of both α6A and α6B, although the α6B sequence (ESYS*) is not suggestive of a PDZ binding site because of its polar C-terminal residue. For high affinity interaction with TIP-2/GIPC, at least one of the residues at positions –1 and –3 must be negatively charged. An aliphatic residue at position 0 increases the affinity of but is not required for this interaction. The α5 integrin subunit also bound to TIP-2/GIPC. The α6 integrin and TIP-2/GIPC co-localize in retraction fibers in carcinoma cells plated on laminin, a finding suggesting a functional interaction in vivo. Our results demonstrate that both splice variants of α6integrin contain a conserved PDZ binding site that enables interaction with TIP-2/GIPC. The binding site in α6B defines a new subclass of type I PDZ interaction site, characterized by a non-aliphatic residue at position 0.

The extracellular domains of integrins dictate the specificity toward extracellular ligands (1Plow E.F. Haas T.A. Zhang L. Loftus J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar), whereas their highly diverse cytoplasmic domains have specific functions in cell signaling and in mediating interactions with the cytoskeleton (2Calderwood D.A.

Integrin α subunit cytoplasmic domains are short, comprised of only tens of amino acids, and they are devoid of enzymatic activities. Despite their small size, these domains are important for integrin function. Studies with chimeric integrin constructs suggested that the conserved, membrane-proximal part of both the α and β subunit cytoplasmic tail is necessary to maintain integrins in a low activation state (3Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12411-12417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although many of the known interactions of integrins with cytoplasmic proteins are mediated by β subunits (4Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), integrin α subunits play important roles in regulating integrin function (5Ylänne J. Chen Y. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Takada Y.

Cell. 1994; 5: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The diversity of integrin α cytoplasmic domains derives from the large number of α subunit gene products, as well as alternative mRNA splicing of these genes (7de Melker A.A. Sonnenberg A. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Comparative studies of specific cytoplasmic domain splice variants, as well as studies with chimeric integrin constructs have linked individual α-subunit sequences to specific cellular responses (8Chan B.M.

Chem. 2000; 276: 9503-9511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which cytoplasmic domain sequences dictate function, however, are largely unknown. Surprisingly, few direct interactions between integrin α subunit tails and intracellular proteins have been described so far (see recent review in Ref. 4Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Paxillin binds to a conserved motif in the α4 cytoplasmic tail (14Liu S. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22736-22742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that α4 is exceptional among α-subunits in interacting with a focal adhesion protein directly. Also, the focal adhesion protein talin has been reported to bind to the αIIb integrin subunit (15Knezevic I. Leisner T.M. Lam S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16416-16421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Nischarin, a recently characterized cytoplasmic protein, binds to the α5 integrin cytoplasmic tail but not to several other α subunits (16Alahari S.K. Lee J.W. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1141-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Nischarin has little homology to proteins with well characterized function, but initial studies suggested that nischarin inhibits cell motility on fibronectin and seems to modulate small G protein function. PDZ domains are found in numerous cytoplasmic proteins, and they interact specifically with either C termini of other proteins or short recognition sequences in a β-hairpin structure somewhere else in the protein (17Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of PDZ domains have explained the need for the C-terminal or β-hairpin location for the recognition sequence. A hydrophobic GLGF-motif acts as a steric block that efficiently prevents longer peptide sequences from interacting with the PDZ domain (18Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). This motif also provides the critical amino acids for coordinating the terminal COOH-group in PDZ interaction with C-terminal sequences (19Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). The recognition sequence is only a few amino acids in length, and the preferred recognition sequences of several different PDZ proteins have been analyzed by the peptide library approach. These studies divided PDZ recognition sequences into two major groups. In class I interactions, the –2 position in the recognition sequence is occupied by a hydroxyl group-containing amino acid (Ser, Thr, or Tyr), whereas in class II interactions, there is a hydrophobic residue in the –2 position. The C-terminal residue (position 0) is hydrophobic (20Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). The peptide library studies make it possible to predict potential PDZ binding sites in the C termini of different proteins. In the current literature, there is no analysis of possible PDZ binding sites in integrin subunits, and no PDZ interactions have been described between integrin cytoplasmic domains and cytoplasmic proteins. For this reason, we analyzed the amino acid sequences of different integrin α subunits and identified two subunits, α6A and α5, with a potential PDZ recognition motif. We used this information for a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify PDZ proteins that interact with the α6A integrin subunit. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate the presence of PDZ interaction site in both splice variants of α6 integrin. The PDZ binding site present in α6B splice variant was not predicted by any previously published models of PDZ interactions, and it defines a new type of PDZ recognition sequence that may be present in many other proteins, too. The pRC/CMV expression vectors containing the α6A and α6B cDNAs have been described previously (21Shaw L.M. Lotz M.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11401-11408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A new α6A construct lacking the last three amino acids was created by site directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The three nucleotides that encode the serine in the –2 position in the C terminus were changed to a stop codon. cDNAs coding for integrin cytoplasmic domains were designed using a common strategy. These constructs started with the first residue of the conserved, membrane-proximal domain of all integrin α subunits. The primers used were as follows: α6A-sense, AAGAATTCAAGTGTGGTTTCTTCAAGA; α6A-antisense, TTGTCGACTTGCATGGTATCGGGGAACAC, α6B-sense, TTGAATTCAAGTGTGGATTCTTTAAACG; α6B-antisense, TTGTCGACCTATGAGTAGCTTTCATTTCTG; αV-sense, TTGAATTCAGGATGGGCTTTTTTAAACG; αV-antisense, TTGTCGACCAGTTAAGTTTCTGAGTTTCC; α2-sense, TAGAATTCAAGCTCGGCTTCTTCAAAAG; α2-antisense, TTGTCGACCCACAATTTCTTCATTC; α3A-sense, TTGAATTCAAGTGCGGCTTCTTCAAG; α3B-sense, TTGAATTCAAGTGTGACTTCTTTAAGC; α3A/B-antisense, TTGTCGACCCTGTGGACTGTCAGAG; α5-sense, TTGAATTCAAGCTTGGATTCTTCAAACG; and α5-antisense, TTGTCGACGACTCAGGCATCAGAGGTG. An alternative construct lacking the last three amino acids was created for α subunits with a PDZ binding domain (α5, α6A, and α6B). In these constructs the PDZ binding domain was deleted by replacing the serine residue in position –2 by a stop codon. These constructs were named Δpdz. α6AΔpdz was created by using the regular α6A-sense/-antisense primers and the α6AΔPDZ full-length cDNA as a template. The other Δpdz constructs were made by using modified antisense primers: α5Δpdz, TTGTCGACGACTCAGGCATCTCAGGTG; α6BΔpdz, TTGTCGACCTATGAGTATCATTCATTTCTG. In addition, constructs coding for only the last seven amino acids of α6A and α6B were designed separately. Primers for these constructs were as follows: α6A-7aa-sense, TTGAATTCGAGAGGCTTACTTCTGATGC; α6A-7aa-antisense, TTGTCGACTTTTGAGTAGCTTTCATTTCTGTTC; α6B-7aa-sense, TTGAATTCAACAGAAATGAAAGCTACTC and α6B-7aa-antisense, TTGTCGACACATGATGTAAGTCAG. Additional mutations to the α6A and α6B C termini were created by using the same sense primer as for other constructs and a mutating the antisense primer as follows (where the asterisk (*) indicates the stop codon): α5/TADA*, TTGTCGACGACTCAGGCATCAGCGGTGGC; α6A/TADA*, TTGTCGACCTATGCATCAGCAGTAAGCCTCTCTTTATC; α6A/ASDA*, TTGTCGACCTATGCATCAGAAGCAAGCCTCTCTTTATC; α6A/ESDA*, TTGTCGACCTATGCATCAGACTCAAGCCTCTCTTTATC; α6A/TSAA*, TTGTCGACCTATGCAGCAGAAGTAAGCCTCTCTTTATC; α6B/EAYS*, TTGTCGACCTATGAGTAGGCTTCATTTCTGTTCCAC; α6B/ASYS*, TTGTCGACCTATGAGTAGCTTGCATTTCTGTTCCAC; α6B/TSYS*, TTGTCGACCTATGAGTAGCTTGTATTTCTGTTCCAC; α6B/ESYA*, TTGTCGACCTATGCGTAGCTTTCATTTCTGTTCCAC; α6B/ESFS*, TTGTCGACCTATGAAAAGCTTTCATTTCTGTTCCAC. The α6A and α6B constructs were created by standard PCR (Expand High Fidelity, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the full-length cDNA as a template, whereas all other sequences were cloned by RT-PCR (Titan, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using MDA-MB-435 (α2 integrin), clone A (α3A, α3B), or Jar (αV, α5) total RNA as a template. Total RNA from these cells was prepared using Tri reagent method (Sigma), and treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega, Madison, WI). The cDNAs were cloned in the EcoRI/SalI site of either pAS2–1 bait vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) or pGEX-4T1 GST1 fusion vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The entire coding sequence of TIP-2/GIPC was amplified by RT-PCR using total RNA from MDA-MB-231 cells, and cloned in frame in the XhoI/EcoRI site of pBAD-A bacterial expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The desired cDNA was amplified in two parts, using the following primers: GIPC5′-sense, TTCTCGAGATGCCGCTGGGACTGGG; GIPC5′-antisense, AATGGCCTTCTCTTCAAAGG; GIPC3′-sense, ACATGATCGAGGCCATTAAC; and GIPC3′-antisense, TTGAATTCACGTCAGTGTCCCTGCTG. The final construct was made by fusing the overlapping sequences at the unique SmlI site. One of the TIP-2/GIPC clones retrieved by yeast two-hybrid screen was used for site directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). The GLGF-loop of TIP-2/GIPC was mutated as previously described (22Lou X. Yano H. Lee F. Chao M.V. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), using the following oligonucleotides: sense, CAAGTCGGAGGATGCAGCCGAGCTCACCATCACGGAC; antisense, GTCCGTGATGGTGAGCTCGGCTGCATCCTCCGACTTG. Three prey vector (pACT2) constructs containing various parts of TIP-2/GIPC sequence were created by standard PCR using the clones retrieved from the two-hybrid screen as a template. The antisense primers were designed to introduce a stop codon immediately after the last included residue of TIP-2/GIPC. The primers were as follows: TIP-2/GIPC (115) sense, AAAGAATTCAGGGCCAAATCGGGCTGGAG; antisense, AACTCGAGCTAGGCCTTGCGAGGCTCCGT; TIP-2/GIPC (123) sense, AAAGAATTCTCATCTTCGCCCACGTGAAGG; antisense, AACTCGAGCTAGGCCTTGCGAGGCTCCGT; TIP-2/GIPC (218) sense, AAAGAATTCCCTTCGACATGATCAGCCAG; antisense, AAACTCGAGTCATCATCG- CAGGGTCCG. Components of the Matchmaker II two-hybrid system were purchased from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA). The cDNA coding for the entire α6A cytoplasmic domain in PAS2–1 vector was used for screening of human mammary gland library (CLONTECH HL4036AH) in yeast strain Y190 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rapidly growing, brownish colonies were picked up between days 6 and 14 of the screen, restreaked, and subjected to the β-galactosidase test. The β-galactosidase reaction was described as being very strong (+++) if apparent in less than 1 h, strong (++) if apparent in 2 h, weak (+) if apparent in 2–6 h, and negative if no color change was detected within 6 h. Prey vector was separated from positive clones by electroporation in HB101 Escherichia coli strain and selection on M9 plates according to the manufacturer's protocol. Inserts were recognized by running a single sequencing reaction using a universal primer binding to the prey vector upstream of the multiple cloning site. A selected insert was recloned in Bluescript KS vector and prepared for further sequencing by nested deletions (ExoIII/mung bean deletion kit, Stratagene). Library colonies tested positive in initial screening were further characterized by two-hybrid tests using several different baits cloned in the EcoRI/SalI site of the pAS2–1 vector. Total cellular RNA was isolated by Tri reagent (Sigma) method. 20 μg of total cellular RNA was run in a reducing paraformaldehyde gel and transferred on Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary transfer using standard protocols. ApaI fragment of TIP-2/GIPC was used as the template for the probe. Labeling was done by Rediprime II random prime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Hybridization was done at 68 °C in QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene), and washes were done up to the stringency of 68 °C/0.1× SSC. The TIP-2/GIPC recombinant protein was produced in E. coli, using the pBAD construct described above and TOP10 E. coli strain (Invitrogen). Cultures in late logarithmic phase were induced with 0.2% l-arabinose (Sigma) for 3.5 h at 37 °C, and the recombinant protein was isolated from the bacterial pellets with Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen). The protein was eluted from column by 250 mm imidazole and dialyzed against 100 mm KCl/20 mm Tris, pH 7.2. GST fusion proteins of integrin cytoplasmic tails were produced using pGEX-4T1 derived plasmids described above and BL21 bacterial strain (Stratagene). Cultures in late logarithmic growth phase were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h. Bacterial pellets were frozen on dry ice, thawed once, and then resuspended in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Bacterial preps were then sonicated, and recombinant proteins were captured from cleared lysates by glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by washes and elution by 5 mm glutathione in 100 mm KCl/50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. All recombinant proteins were stored as glycerol stocks at −80 °C. 500 pmol of GST fusion constructs and 20 pmol of recombinant His6/GIPC protein were used for each in vitro pull-down assay. Recombinant proteins were diluted in 500 μl of buffer and stirred with glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were blocked with 5% milk before use. RIPA binding buffer contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% BSA, 1% Triton-X, 1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Binding buffer “1%NP” contained 50 mmTris, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% BSA, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After the binding, beads were washed three times with a buffer identical to the binding buffer but lacking BSA. Samples were analyzed by standard Western blotting using INDIA His-Probe (Pierce). Signal was detected by West Pico chemiluminescence system (Pierce). The experiments were performed in quadruple, and the results were quantified from the film by image analyzing techniques. Binding to GST was used as the measure of background binding, and this was subtracted from the experimental data before analysis. Mutant constructs were compared with the wild type integrin construct, and the results were expressed as a percentage ± S.D. MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell lines were obtained from Lombardi Breast Cancer Depository at Georgetown University. They were grown in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Clone A colon carcinoma cells were grown in RPMI-1680 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Coverslips were coated with 50 μg/ml of type I collagen (Vitrogen, Cohesion Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) or 20 μg/ml of EHS-laminin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in PBS overnight and subsequently blocked with 1% BSA. Cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA and washed three times with RPMI 1680 medium containing 0.2% BSA. Cells were plated on coverslips and incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 for the time periods described. In some experiments, the cells were plated on collagen for 50 min and then treated with 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma) for 10 min. In another set of experiments, the cells were plated on laminin for 30 min and then treated with 100 nmstaurosporine (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for 15 min. After the experiment the cells were washed once with PBS and fixed with paraformaldehyde for 5 min as previously described (23Rabinovitz I. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). After fixation, the cells were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and then washed several times with PBS. Immunohistochemical stainings with anti-GIPC antiserum (kind gift of Dr. Marilyn Gist Farquhar) and anti-α6 integrin antibody (GoH3; Immunotech, Marseilles, France) were followed by secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Cy3-coupled antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). After the staining and washes, the samples were treated with 1% paraformaldehyde for 3 min and then washed and embedded in medium containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 150 mmNaCl, 90% glycerol, and 1% n-propyl gallate. The samples were analyzed by confocal microscopy. The expression pattern of the α6A and α6B integrin splice variants was studied by RT-PCR. The primer pair was designed so that both upper and lower primer hybridized with the sequence common to both splice variants, and the reaction product spanned the differentially spliced region. The expected product sizes were 347 (α6A) and 216 base pairs (α6B). The primers were as follows: α6-sense, TCATCCTAGTGGCTATTCTC; α6-antisense, CTTTCATTTCTGTTCCACTT. DNase-treated total RNA (0.2 μg) was used for the reaction, and the reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel. A 100-base pair ladder (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was used as the molecular weight standard. Analysis of the sequences of human integrin α subunits (Fig. 1) revealed that two human integrin α chains have a typical class I PDZ binding sequence in their C terminus: α6A and α5 (last three residues SDA*). This motif constitutes a classical Class I PDZ binding site, with a hydroxyl group-containing residue at –2 and a hydrophobic residue at 0. Although most PDZ domains seem to favor isoleucine or valine at 0, the SDA* sequence is an almost perfect match with the peptide library data (20Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar) and the structural model of critical interaction sites (19Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Although some other integrin α subunits (αV, α6B, and α7C) have a serine residue at –2, they fail to comply with the requirement of an aliphatic residue at position 0. We did not recognize type II PDZ binding sites in any of the integrin sequences presented in Fig. 1. It should be noted that the α7 sequences are of rat origin, because only the human α7B isoform is currently available in data bases. Integrin cytoplasmic domains are highly conserved between species, and therefore the use of rat α7 sequences in the analysis is unlikely to affect the results. Based on our sequence analysis, we sought to identify proteins that interact with the type I PDZ interaction site found in the α6A and α5integrins. The entire α6A cytoplasmic domain was cloned in the pAS2–1 bait vector and used for screening a human mammary gland yeast two-hybrid library. Most tissues and cell lines express both isoforms of the α6 integrin, whereas the ductal and alveolar epithelia of the mammary gland are known to express the α6A isoform solely (7de Melker A.A. Sonnenberg A. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, a mammary gland library was considered particularly suitable for identifying potential binding partners of the α6A integrin. Nineteen of the most rapidly growing clones that were positive in the β-galactosidase test were selected for analysis by automated sequencing. Of these clones, 11 of 19 contained varying lengths of the same cDNA sequence. The sequence data obtained was identical to AF028824and AK022585; the former sequence is the partial reading frame of TIP-2 (Tax interaction protein clone 2) (24Rousset R. Fabre S. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and the latter sequence is the complete coding sequence of TIP-2 from an unrelated sequencing project. Except for some conservative mutations our sequences were also identical to the published sequence of human GIPC (AF089816) (25De Vries L. Lou X. Zhao G. Zheng B. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12340-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). One of our clones contained the entire reading frame, and we sequenced this clone to verify the identity of our sequence. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the amino acid sequences of TIP-2 and GIPC are 100% identical, and therefore we refer to the protein as TIP-2/GIPC. For functional studies we cloned the open reading frame of TIP-2/GIPC from MDA-MB-231 cells by RT-PCR, and also this sequence was identical to the published TIP-2 sequence (AF028824/AK022585). The published sequences of TIP-2/GIPC contain very little sequence upstream of the proposed translation start site. Also, the clone that we isolated from the library started only a few nucleotides in the 5′ direction of the start codon. To exclude the possibility that there was any unpublished coding sequence, we performed Northern hybridization of total RNA isolated from two breast carcinoma cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 (Fig.2). Northern hybridization cannot differentiate between TIP-2 and GIPC sequences, but it clearly shows that the probe detects a single band at about 2.0 kilobases, the size of GIPC (25De Vries L. Lou X. Zhao G. Zheng B. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12340-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that mRNAs of TIP-2 and GIPC are of the same size and that they contain the same size of an open reading frame and identical amino acid sequences. Thus, the discrepancies between published TIP-2 and GIPC sequences make no difference for functional studies. The specificity of the interaction between α6A integrin and TIP-2/GIPC was verified by two-hybrid tests using wild type and mutated integrin sequences. Because the α5 integrin has the same putative PDZ recognition sequence (TSDA*) as α6A, this integrin subunit was also used in these tests. Mutant constructs of both α6A and α5 with the last three amino acids deleted were created (named α6AΔpdz and α5Δpdz). Because mutation of the –2 position serine should be sufficient for abolishing type I PDZ interaction, we also made constructs with the –2 position serine mutated to alanine. These constructs, as well as all other integrin cytoplasmic domain point mutants used in this study, were named by listing the last four residues using the standard one-letter code for amino acids (α6A/TADA* and α5/TADA*). The α6B cytoplasmic domain was selected as a negative control. The results of these experiments are shown in TableI. A TIP-2/GIPC clone containing residues 102–333 and captured by the original two-hybrid screen was used as a prey in these experiments. TIP-2/GIPC interacted strongly with both α6A and α5, and deletion of the last three amino acids (Δpdz) or mutation of the –2 position serine (α6A/TADA* and α5/TADA*) completely abolished the interaction, as expected. Surprisingly, however, α6B also interacted with TIP-2/GIPC.Table IConfirmatory yeast two-hybrid testsβ-Galactosidase testpAS2–1Negativeα6A++α6AΔPDZNegativeα6A/TADA*Negativeα5++α5ΔpdzNegativeα5/TADA*Negativeα6B++A TIP-2/GIPC clone captured in the original library screen, and coding for residues 102–333 was used in confirmatory yeast two-hybrid tests. pAS2–1 is the bait vector, and other constructs are described in detail in the text.

The color reaction was estimated as follows: visible within 1 h, +++; within 2 h, ++; within 6 h, +; no reaction, negative. Because the α6B integrin C terminus (ESYS*) is not suggestive of a PDZ domain, we designed several lines of experiments to find out whether the interaction between the α6B cytoplasmic domain and TIP-2/GIPC actually was a PDZ interaction. A deletion mutant of α6B lacking the last three amino acids (α6BΔpdz) and –2 position point mutation construct (α6B/EAYS*) were used for verifying the interaction site, and several other integrins were included in the two-hybrid tests as controls. Because the interaction between α6A/α5 and TIP-2/GIPC is clearly a type I PDZ interaction, we reasoned that α6B integrin sequence might represent a subtype of PDZ interaction site not revealed by the peptide library screens.

https://openalex.org/W2028445104,"We have previously shown a connection between histone H1 phosphorylation and the transcriptional competence of the hormone inducible mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter. Prolonged exposure of mouse cells to dexamethasone concurrently dephosphorylated histone H1 and rendered the MMTV promoter refractory to hormonal stimulation and, therefore, transcriptionally unresponsive. Using electrospray mass spectrometry, we demonstrate here that prolonged dexamethasone treatment differentially effects a subset of the six somatic H1 isoforms in mouse cells. H1 isoforms H1.0, H1.1, and H1.2 are non-responsive to hormone whereas prolonged dexamethasone treatment effectively dephosphorylated the H1.3, H1.4, and H1.5 isoforms. The protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, shown to dephosphorylate histone H1 and down-regulate MMTV in cultured cells, appears only to completely dephosphorylate the H1.3 isoform. These results suggest that dephosphorylation of specific histone H1 isoforms may contribute to the previously observed decrease in transcriptional competence of the MMTV promoter through the modulation of chromatin structure. In a broader sense, this work advances the hypothesis that post-translational modifications of individual histone H1 isoforms directly influence the transcriptional activation/repression of specific genes.

In a broader sense, this work advances the hypothesis that post-translational modifications of individual histone H1 isoforms directly influence the transcriptional activation/repression of specific genes. mouse mammary tumor virus reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Eukaryotic DNA is efficiently organized into the highly ordered yet dynamic structure called chromatin (1van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar, 2Zlatanova J. Leuba S.H. van Holde K. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1999; 9: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The primary, repeating structural unit of chromatin is the nucleosome and is composed of 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around an octamer of four core histone proteins: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (3Wolffe A.P. Kurumizaka H. Progr. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 379-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the linker histone or histone H1 protein binds to the linker DNA between nucleosomes and is thought to function primarily in the condensation of chromatin into higher ordered structures (4Ramakrishnan V. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1997; 7: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). While the core histones are highly conserved in eukaryotes, with H4 being nearly invariant, histone H1 is much more evolutionarily diverse, and in mammals, consists of six somatic H1 isoforms (H1.0 through H1.5, using the nomenclature of Doenecke and co-workers, Ref. 5Albig W. Kardalinou E. Drabent B. Zimmer A. Doenecke D. Genomics. 1991; 10: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and one testis-specific isoform (H1.t). The H1 isoforms share a common protein structural fold with the N- and C-terminal “tail” regions extending from a central globular domain. The central globular domain is primarily responsible for binding to DNA, while the tail regions function to modulate protein interaction with DNA (4Ramakrishnan V. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1997; 7: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that histone H1 binds nucleosomes at the dyad axis and contacts duplex DNA as it enters and exits the nucleosome (6Thomas J.O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, in the specific case of the 5 S rRNA gene from Xenopus, there is evidence to suggest that histone H1 binds asymmetrically to the nucleosome on a position off the dyad axis and within a DNA gyre (6Thomas J.O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 7Pruss D. Bartholomew B. Persinger J. Hayes J. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Wolffe A.P.

A growing body of evidence suggests that the linker histones function in part to modulate transcriptional activity through chromatin organization (reviewed in Ref. 9Zlatanova J. Caiafa P. Van Holde K. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Initially, it was thought that histone H1 would have a general role in global gene activity, as actively transcribed genes are depleted of H1 proteins (10Zlatanova J. van Holde K. Progr. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 52: 217-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bresnick E.H. Bustin M. Marsaud V. Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, studies have demonstrated that histone H1 differentially acts on specific gene sequences to control transcription. Shen and Gorovsky (12Shen X. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 475-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) showed, using a knockout technique in Tetrahymena thermophila, that H1 removal produces targeted and not global effects on gene activity. It was further shown that the phosphorylation of Tetrahymena histone H1 regulates specific gene activity by mimicking H1 removal from chromatin (13Dou Y. Mizzen C.A. Abrams M. Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 641-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Studies inXenopus oocytes have shown that H1 acts as a specific repressor of the 5S rRNA gene through the modulation of chromatin structure (14Bouvet P. Dimitrov S. Wolffe A.P.

In addition, Brown et al. (19Brown D.T. Alexander B.T. Sittman D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have studied the effect of overexpression of specific H1 isoforms on gene expression in mammalian cells and found in one instance that H1.0 overexpression led to specific gene repression while H1.2 overexpression lead to specific gene activation. In contrast, in the case of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)1 promoter, overexpression of H1.0 and H1.2 isoforms was shown to increase both the basal and hormone-induced levels of the MMTV reporter gene transcript (20Gunjan A. Brown D.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3355-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The positively charged tails of the linker histones neutralize the negatively charged backbone of DNA and facilitate the structural organization of chromatin into higher ordered structures (4Ramakrishnan V. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1997; 7: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of specific serine and threonine residues in the C-terminal tail region of histone H1 is thought to loosen its interaction with DNA and serves to modulate protein function. Histone H1 phosphorylation is cell cycle-dependent. The phosphorylation level of the H1 isoforms is the lowest in the G1 phase and increases as the cell cycle proceeds, with maximal phosphorylation occurring during M-phase (21Talasz H. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. Lindner H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, hyperphosphorylation of histone H1, a state generally associated with the opening of chromatin domains, is correlated with mitotic condensation of chromosomes (22Bradbury E.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 23Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 93-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), yet H1 phosphorylation does not appear to be a requirement for mitotic chromatin condensation in either mammals (24Guo X.W. Th'ng J.P. Swank R.A. Anderson H.J. Tudan C. Bradbury E.M. Roberge M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) or Xenopus oocytes (25Ohsumi K. Katagiri C. Kishimoto T. Science. 1993; 262: 2033-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). While the phosphorylation status of bulk histone H1 has been well characterized in the different stages of the cell cycle, little is known about the role of phosphorylation in the cellular function of individual H1 isoforms. In addition, while histone H1 is a common in vitrosubstrate for numerous protein kinases, little is known about specificin vivo histone H1 modifying enzymes. Cdk2 is a cell cycle-dependent protein kinase known to act on histone H1in vivo (26Spencer V.A. Davie J.R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 240: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and recent evidence suggests that the kinase activity of Cdk2 toward H1 can be down-regulated in response to prolonged exposure to the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (27Bhattacharjee R.N. Banks G.C. Trotter K.W. Lee H.L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5417-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that prolonged exposure of 1471.1 cells to the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone significantly decreased the level of histone H1 phosphorylation (28Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the decrease in histone H1 phosphorylation after prolonged dexamethasone treatment was correlated with the MMTV promoter becoming refractory to glucocorticoid stimulation (28Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The MMTV promoter is an ideal system to study the relationship between chromatin structure and gene expression because of its well characterized chromatin architecture and hormone responsiveness (29Archer T.K. Cordingley M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 30Hager G.L. Archer T.K. Fragoso G. Bresnick E.H. Tsukagoshi Y. John S. Smith C.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylated histone H1, when bound to the chromatin structure over the MMTV promoter, is thought to restrict chromatin remodeling and transcription factor access, which are necessary steps in the transcriptional activation of MMTV. Furthermore, exposure of cells to staurosporine, a potent kinase inhibitor, resulted in the complete dephosphorylation of histone H1 and the MMTV promoter becoming refractory to hormonal stimulation (28Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As the Western analysis used in our previous investigation did not differentiate between the specific histone H1 isoforms, we chose to investigate the phosphorylation status of the individual histone H1 isoforms in response to hormone treatment using mass spectrometry. Specifically, we investigated which isoforms were dephosphorylated in response to staurosporine and prolonged dexamethasone treatment and therefore may be responsible for the MMTV promoter's refractory state. Using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), we have identified three H1 isoforms (H1.3, H1.4, and H1.5) that are responsive to hormone exposure; i.e. prolonged dexamethasone exposure results in a decline in the relative phosphorylation level of the isoforms. In addition, we show by ESI-MS that while staurosporine did not significantly affect the phosphorylation status of isoforms H1.0, H1.1, and H1.2, it decreased the level of H1.4 and H1.5 phosphorylation and completely dephosphorylated H1.3. These data suggest that phosphorylation of specific histone H1 isoforms can be modulated by hormone exposure. Mouse 1471.1 cells, derived from a C127 parental cell line, were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% CO2 (28Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cells were untreated or treated with 10−7 m dexamethasone for 48 h or 10−7 m dexamethasone for 24 h followed by 24-h washout conditions. Washout conditions consisted of washing the cells twice with phosphate-buffered saline and adding DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. In other experiments, 1471.1 cells were co-treated with staurosporine (100 ng/ml) and dexamethasone (10−7 m) or 24 h. Staurosporine was purchased from Sigma. Histone H1 and other chromatin-related proteins are soluble in dilute acid and were initially extracted from whole cells using 5% perchloric acid. After centrifugation to remove cellular debris, the remaining soluble proteins were precipitated using trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 30%. The precipitated proteins were then washed twice with acetone, dried, reconstituted in water, and stored at −80 °C until analysis. The histone H1 isoforms were further purified from other acid soluble proteins using an Agilent HP110 HPLC system and anAmersham Pharmacia Biotech Sephasil C4 reverse phase column (5 μm, 4.6/250 mm) with a linear gradient from 33 to 45% buffer B over 65 min. Buffer A consisted of water plus 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, and buffer B consisted of acetonitrile plus 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The elution profile was constructed from absorbance measurements at 214 nm. Purified samples were dried, reconstituted in water, and stored at −80 °C until use. A Micromass Q-Tof (Altrincham, UK) hybrid tandem mass spectrometer (31Borchers C. Parker C.E. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 854: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was used for the acquisition of the ESI-MS spectra. The instrument is equipped with a nanoflow electrospray source and consists of a quadrupole mass filter and an orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The needle voltage was ∼3000 V, cone voltage was 60 V, collision energy was 4.0 eV, and the source was maintained at 80 °C for the MS analyses. Samples for flow injection analyses were infused into the mass spectrometer at ∼200 nanoliters/min using a pressure injection vessel (32Deterding L.J. Moseley M.A. Tomer K.B. Jorgenson J.W. Anal. Chem. 1989; 61: 2504-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Data were acquired over the m/zrange of 50–3000 at 1.9 s/scan. Data analysis was accomplished with a MassLynx data system and MaxEnt software supplied by the manufacturer. The total relative phosphorylation level for each isoform was computed first by normalizing the intensity of each phosphorylated ion species to the unphosphorylated ion within each spectrum and (see Fig. 4), second, by taking the sum of the normalized intensities for the phosphorylated ions. The summed intensities were then normalized to the untreated sample to produce the numbers in Table II. While the direct comparison of ion abundance between different spectra cannot be made, comparison of the total relative phosphorylation levels of isoforms between spectra is possible. Although the addition of negatively charged phosphate groups to a protein generally reduces its ion abundance in the mass spectrometer in the positive ion mode, relative to the unphosphorylated species, the H1 isoforms have large overall positive charges with ∼50 positively charged amino acid residues per isoform (4Ramakrishnan V. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1997; 7: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore, the addition of 1 or 2 phosphate groups per H1 protein molecule is not expected to significantly affect the ionization potential and thus allows for comparative analysis of the relative phosphorylation level between the different spectra. The presence of sodium adducts on some ions and not others is merely coincidental and are artifacts of the mass spectrometry procedure.Table IISummary of total relative phosphorylation levels of the histone H1.3, H1.4, and H1.5 isoformsH1.3H1.4H1.5Untreated11148 Dex0.390.200.2024/24 Dex0.870.700.45Staurosporine−0.280.30Relative H1 phosphorylation levels were computed as described in “Materials and Methods” for each of the four different conditions (untreated, 48-hour Dex., 24/24-hour Dex./washout, and co-treatment of staurosporine + dexamethasone (Staurosporine)).

The numbers correspond to phosphorylation levels normalized to the level of the untreated sample for each isoform. No phosphorylation was detected by ESI-MS for the H1.3 staurosporine sample, as indicated by the minus symbol (−). Acid soluble proteins extracted from whole cells were run on 16% Tris/glycine gels (Novex/Invitrogen) at 150 V for 3 h at room temperature. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 2 h at 300 mA and probed using 1 μg/μl anti-histone H1 and phosphospecific histone H1 antibodies (Upstate Biotech) under standard conditions (28Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Using immunological techniques, our laboratory has previously shown that histone H1 is progressively dephosphorylated in response to prolonged dexamethasone treatment (28Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, this type of analysis is inherently limited, as the available phosphospecific antibody has been reported to recognize only one of the six H1 isoforms present, see below (33Chadee D.N. Allis C.D. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8113-8116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To gain a more complete picture of histone H1 phosphorylation status, we chose to examine the dexamethasone-induced changes in phosphorylation of the individual histone H1 isoforms by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Prior to ESI-MS analysis, H1 proteins were acid-extracted from mouse 1471.1 cells and further purified from other acid soluble proteins using RP-HPLC. Samples were purified on a C4 reverse phase column with a linear gradient from 33 to 45% organic phase over 65 min (Fig.1). A representative chromatogram for the purification of histone H1 from 1471.1 cells is shown in Fig. 1, with the isoforms fractionating into two groups, Peak 1 and Peak 2. All the H1 samples analyzed by ESI-MS in this work were first purified by RP-HPLC as described above and exhibited a similar elution profile as shown in Fig. 1 (data not shown). There are six somatic histone H1 isoforms present in this mouse cell line, H1.0 though H1.5, yet only four bands are present on the 16% SDS-PAGE gel because H1.1, H1.3, and H1.4 isoforms co-migrate and are therefore not resolved (Fig. 1,inset). As observed by Lee and Archer (28Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) using Western analysis with the phosphospecific H1 antibody, a decrease in the level of histone H1 phosphorylation is observed after 48 h of dexamethasone treatment (Fig. 2A, lane 2) followed by subsequent re-phosphorylation upon washout of the hormone in the 24/24-hour conditions (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Further analysis of the Western blot in comparison to the stained gel in Fig.2A, illustrates that of four protein bands observed on the SDS gel only one band is recognized by the phosphospecific H1 antibody (compare the lower stained SDS-PAGE gel to theupper Western blot in Fig. 2A). Furthermore, Fig.2A clearly illustrates that the band recognized by the phosphospecific histone H1 antibody is from the RP-HPLC Peak 2 fraction. This protein band that is recognized by the antibody in Peak 2 contains the H1.1, H1.3, and H1.4 isoforms as determined by mass spectrometry in Fig. 3B. The other protein band observed on the SDS-PAGE gel from Peak 2 in Fig.2A contains only the H1.2 isoform. Previously published results have suggested that the phosphorylated form of H1.5 (using the nomenclature of Doenecke and co-workers Ref. 5Albig W. Kardalinou E. Drabent B. Zimmer A. Doenecke D. Genomics. 1991; 10: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar or H1.b using the nomenclature of Lennox et al., Ref. 34Lennox R.W. Oshima R.G. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5183-5189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is the target of this phosphospecific antibody (35Lu M.J. Dadd C.A. Mizzen C.A. Perry C.A. McLachlan D.R. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1994; 103: 111-121PubMed Google Scholar). However, we demonstrate that this antibody does not recognize any protein in Peak 1 (Fig. 2A,lane 4), which contains the H1.0 and H1.5 isoforms as determined by mass spectrometry (Fig. 3A). Although the Western blot analysis in Fig. 2A tells us that the H1.1, H1.3, or H1.4 isoforms are exhibiting dexamethasone-induced changes in phosphorylation, the mass spectral data in Fig. 3A and B demonstrates that other isoforms are also phosphorylated. Therefore, other phosphorylated histone H1 isoforms that are invisible to the phosphospecific H1 antibody may also display dexamethasone-induced changes in phosphorylation status, which ESI-MS will determine.Figure 3Electrospray mass spectra for an RP-HPLC-purified sample demonstrates that all somatic histone H1 isoforms are present. 1471.1 cells were treated for 24 h with 10−7 m dexamethasone followed by 24 h of washout conditions, acid-extracted from whole cells, and purified by RP-HPLC, as shown in Fig. 1, prior to electrospray mass spectrometry analysis. There are a total of six somatic histone H1 isoforms present in 1471.1 cells, and the spectrum corresponding to the RP-HPLC Peak 1 fraction (A) contains the H1.0 and H1.5 isoforms while the Peak 2 fraction (B) contains the H1.1, H1.2, H1.3, and H1.4 isoforms. See Table I for observed m/z values. For simplicity, ions are labeled with the particular type of post-translational modification adorning the protein: A,acetyl group (43 Da); P phosphate group (80 Da);Na+, sodium adduct (23 Da); unmod., unmodified. The presence of sodium adducts on some ions and not others is merely coincidental and are artifacts of the mass spectrometry procedure. Note that individual ions labeled with P only are phosphorylated and not acetylated, while ions labeled only withA are acetylated and not phosphorylated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Additional Western analysis of the acid-extracted proteins using the anti-H1 antibody (which recognizes all histone H1 isoforms) in Fig.2B, lane 2 illustrates that all bands observed on the stained gel (Fig. 2B, lane 1) are histone H1. As has been previously published, staurosporine can completely dephosphorylate histone H1 (28Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Western analysis using the phosphospecific H1 antibody (Fig. 2C lane 2) confirms that histone H1 isolated from 1471.1 cells co-treated with staurosporine and dexamethasone does not contain measurable levels of phosphorylation. Staurosporine-dephosphorylated H1 samples from 1471.1 cells were subsequently used as a control for the mass spectrometry analysis of the untreated and dexamethasone-treated samples. From the ESI-MS analysis of histone H1 from 1471.1 cells (Fig. 3, A and B), we show that the H1.0 and H1.5 isoforms are present in RP-HPLC Peak 1 and the H1.1, H1.2, H1.3, and H1.4 isoforms are present in RP-HPLC Peak 2 (see TableI for observed mass values). The mass spectra for Peak 1 and Peak 2 also illustrate that the H1 isoforms are monoacetylated and, except for H1.0, are phosphorylated to varying degrees. H1.2 exhibits the highest level of phosphorylation relative to the other H1 isoforms, with up to six phosphate groups present per protein molecule. However, not all of the total cellular H1.2 protein is fully saturated to the maximal level, but instead we see a range of protein phosphorylation that steps up in mass by 80 Da (one phosphate group) from one phosphate to a maximum of six phosphates. This kind of phosphorylation for H1.2, where the isoform is essentially unsaturated, is observed for all the isoforms expect for H1.0.Table IObserved mass values for histone H1 isoforms from 1471.1 cellsIsoformUntreated48 Dex24/24 DexStaur.Calc.

Although each of the three H1.3 samples (untreated (panel a), 48-hour (panel b), and 24/24-hour (panel c)) in Fig. 4Amaintain a certain level of phosphorylation, the abundance of the 1P,1A ion (1 phosphate group and 1 acetyl group) relative to the unphosphorylated 1A ion for the 48-hour sample is decreased in comparison to the relative abundance of the same ions for the untreated and 24/24-hour samples. Therefore, these data suggest that the relative phosphorylation level of the H1.3 isoform is less in the 48-hour sample compared with the untreated and 24/24-hour samples. This pattern of phosphorylation was also seen for the H1.4 and H1.5 isoforms (Fig. 4,B and C) and mimics the Western blot analysis of the same samples shown in Fig. 2A. As mentioned above, the phosphospecific H1 antibody was shown to recognize a single band in the peak that contained H1.1, H1.3, and H1.4 isoforms (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2C demonstrates that the H1 isoform(s) isolated from staurosporine-treated cells are completely dephosphorylated as determined by Western blot analysis using the phosphospecific H1 antibody. Interestingly, analysis of the ESI-MS data for the staurosporine-treated samples indicates that while H1.4 is phosphorylated, no detectable level of phosphorylation is evident for the H1.3 isoform (see Fig. 4, A and B and TableII). ESI-MS analysis also shows that the H1.0, H1.1, and H1.2 isoforms are relatively unaffected by staurosporine treatment (see Table I). Therefore, these data led us to the conclusion that the phosphospecific H1 antibody specifically targets the phosphorylated H1.3 isoform. Moreover, the H1.2, H1.4, and H1.5 isoforms are more highly phosphorylated than H1.3 under all the conditions analyzed. For example, the H1.3-untreated sample in Fig.4A has only one phosphate group per protein molecule while both the H1.4- and H1.5-untreated samples have up to two phosphate groups (Fig. 4, B and C), and H1.2 has up to six phosphate groups per protein molecule (see Fig. 3B and TableI). The observed mass values for all the isoforms from 1471.1 cells under the different dexamethasone and staurosporine treatments are listed in Table I. H1.0 is the only isoform that is completely unmodified and is predominately found in this unmodified state, relative to the monoacetylated form of the isoform (see Fig. 3A). While all the other isoforms are monoacetylated, the H1.2 protein consists of a mixture of unacetylated and monoacetylated forms. The total relative phosphorylation level of the H1.3, H1.4, and H1.5 isoforms under the different conditions is summarized in Table II (see “Materials and Methods” for details on computing total relative phosphorylation levels). These three H1 isoforms each exhibited a similar pattern of dephosphorylation after 48 hours of dexamethasone treatment with a concomitant re-phosphorylation after dexamethasone washout (24/24-hour Dex). The phosphorylation level of the H1.0, H1.1, and H1.2 isoforms did not significantly change under all conditions tested, and, therefore, are not included in TableII. Staurosporine appeared to affect phosphorylation of the H1.3 isoform most intensely such that H1.3 was completely dephosphorylated relative to what was observed with dexamethasone alone. Post-translational modification of histones serves as a powerful yet reversible mechanism for regulating their function in cellular processes (9Zlatanova J. Caiafa P. Van Holde K. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Bradbury E.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 23Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Trends Biochem.

Grunstein M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown an assortment of post-translational modifications (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and ADP-ribosylation) of the core and linker histones can modulate chromatin structure and function (reviewed in Refs. 22Bradbury E.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar and 26Spencer V.A. Davie J.R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 240: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been suggested that combinations of modifications on histones in a localized area of chromatin may translate into some type of “histone code” that facilitates or signals other proteins to act (37Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6448) Google Scholar). To this end, differential modifications of the H1 isoforms have been reported; however, the contribution of these modifications toward the function of individual H1 isoforms in chromatin organization and gene regulation remains elusive (21Talasz H. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. Lindner H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 38Giancotti V. Bandiera A. Ciani L. Santoro D. Crane-Robinson C. Goodwin G.H. Boiocchi M. Dolcetti R. Casetta B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Lee and Archer (28Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) have suggested a direct connection between H1 phosphorylation and the transcriptional responsiveness of the MMTV promoter. It was reasoned that dephosphorylated histone H1 would repress chromatin remodeling and transcription factor loading by modulating the chromatin structure over the MMTV promoter (28Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As was observed using the 5 S rRNA gene, the mobility of precisely positioned nucleosomes was suppressed by the binding of histone H1 (39Pennings S. Meersseman G. Bradbury E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10275-10279Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and is the same type of mechanism expected for the MMTV promoter with its phased array of positioned nucleosomes. However, the Western blot technique employed previously (28Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) precluded the analysis of the phosphorylation status of the specific isoforms. The data here suggest that H1.3, H1.4, and H1.5 isoforms may be responsible for the refractory state of the MMTV promoter after prolonged hormone exposure. Furthermore, ESI-MS analysis of the staurosporine sample, showing only the complete dephosphorylation of the H1.3 isoform (Fig. 4A), implicates H1.3 as the specific isoform responsible for modulating the chromatin structure over the MMTV promoter. Previously it was suggested that the phosphospecific antibody was recognizing phosphorylated H1.5 as its target (33Chadee D.N. Allis C.D. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8113-8116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35Lu M.J. Dadd C.A. Mizzen C.A. Perry C.A. McLachlan D.R. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1994; 103: 111-121PubMed Google Scholar). However, a combination of Western blot and ESI-MS analyses (Figs. 2 and 3) indicate that the phosphospecific antibody is recognizing either the H1.1, H1.3, or H1.4 isoforms. Because H1.3 is the only isoform completely dephosphorylated after staurosporine treatment (Fig. 4, compare A, panel d to B, panel d and C, panel d) and no phosphoproteins were detected in the Western analysis of the staurosporine-treated samples (Fig.2C), the phosphospecific H1 antibody is most likely recognizing the phosphorylated form of the H1.3 isoform (Fig.2A). Giancotti et al. (38Giancotti V. Bandiera A. Ciani L. Santoro D. Crane-Robinson C. Goodwin G.H. Boiocchi M. Dolcetti R. Casetta B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) used mass spectrometry to show that mouse H1.0 is unmodified and H1.2 (H1c, Ref. 34Lennox R.W. Oshima R.G. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5183-5189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has up to five phosphate groups. Similar to our findings, they showed H1.2 was unsaturated with 2, 3, and 5 phosphate groups present (38Giancotti V. Bandiera A. Ciani L. Santoro D. Crane-Robinson C. Goodwin G.H. Boiocchi M. Dolcetti R. Casetta B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, Giancotti et al. (38Giancotti V. Bandiera A. Ciani L. Santoro D. Crane-Robinson C. Goodwin G.H. Boiocchi M. Dolcetti R. Casetta B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), showed that H1.3, H1.4, and H1.5 (H1.d, H1e, and H1b respectively) had a maximum of one phosphate group per isoform in mouse Lewis Lung Carcinoma, normal lung, thymus, and lymphoma tissue. Using acid/urea gel electrophoresis, Talaszet al. (21Talasz H. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. Lindner H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) analyzed mouse histone H1 from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, at different stages of the cell cycle. They separated the H1 isoforms into two groups: low phosphorylation levels H1.0, H1.1, and H1.2 (H1a, H1c, H10, Ref. 34Lennox R.W. Oshima R.G. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5183-5189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and high phosphorylation levels H1.3, H1.4, H1.5 (H1b, H1d, H1e, Ref. 34Lennox R.W. Oshima R.G. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5183-5189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During mitosis, they found that the H1.1, H1.2, and H1.4 isoforms had four phosphate groups while H1.3 and H1.5 had five phosphate groups, but the levels of phosphorylation decreased significantly in G1 phase. Differences in phosphorylation levels of the H1 isoforms observed in this work relative to Talasz et al. (21Talasz H. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. Lindner H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) are likely due to differences in cell type and origin. The ability of a small negatively charged phosphate group to exert such a large influence over functional properties of histone H1 is not surprising. Although the H1 isoforms carry a high positive charge and the addition of 1 to 2 phosphate groups will not make significant changes to the overall charge of the protein, small localized changes in the DNA-contacting regions or in the secondary structure of the protein may be responsible for the observed phosphorylation induced effects (40Gaudet R. Savage J.R. McLaughlin J.N. Willardson B.M. Sigler P.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, identifying the post-translational modifications of the individual isoforms will be important in defining their roles in activities such as gene-specific transcriptional regulation. In addition, identifying kinases, such as the cell cycle-dependent enzyme Cdk2, that may act on a subset of H1 isoforms in vivo will be important to understanding the functional significance of the various post-translational modifications (26Spencer V.A. Davie J.R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 240: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). From data to be published elsewhere, our laboratory has shown that dexamethasone inhibits Cdk2, and this inhibition is primarily responsible for the decline in H1 phosphorylation levels after prolonged dexamethasone exposure (27Bhattacharjee R.N. Banks G.C. Trotter K.W. Lee H.L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5417-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However the presence of numerous phosphorylated isoforms after prolonged dexamethasone and staurosporine treatment, i.e. H1.4 and H1.5, suggests that additional kinases, not sensitive to these compounds, are acting on the isoforms. Distribution of the H1 isoforms to distinct regions of the nucleus may also contribute to the differential functionality of the isoforms (41Parseghian M.H. Harris D.A. Rishwain D.R. Hamkalo B.A. Chromosoma. 1994; 103: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar,42Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and such trafficking may depend on post-translational modifications of the proteins in response to varied stimuli (43Lu M.J. Mpoke S.S. Dadd C.A. Allis C.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 44Lever M.A. Th'ng J.P. Sun X. Hendzel M.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Future experiments will need to expand on the concept of individual histone H1 isoforms acting as gene-specific regulators of transcriptional activity through the modulation of chromatin structure.

Although both proteins are required for activity, core RAG1 (the catalytically active region containing residues 384–1008 of 1040) alone displays binding specificity for the conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences of the RSS. The nonamer-binding region lies near the N terminus of core RAG1, whereas the heptamer-binding region has not been identified. Here, potential domains within core RAG1 were identified using limited proteolysis studies. An iterative procedure of DNA cloning, protein expression, and characterization revealed the presence of two topologically independent domains within core RAG1, referred to as the central domain (residues 528–760) and the C-terminal domain (residues 761–980). The domains do not include the nonamer-binding region but rather largely span the remaining relatively uncharacterized region of core RAG1. Characterization of macromolecular interactions revealed that the central domain bound to the RSS with specificity for the heptamer and contained the predominant binding site for RAG2. The C-terminal domain bound DNA cooperatively but did not show specificity for either conserved RSS element.

The basis for this immense diversity in many species is a complex rearrangement of the V (variable), D (diversity), and J (joining) gene segments that together encode the variable regions of T cell receptors and immunoglobulins (see Ref. 1Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar for review). This process, known as V(D)J recombination, requires the activity of a wide array of enzymes and is initiated by the lymphoid-specific recombination-activating proteins RAG1 and RAG2. The RAG proteins guide recombination events to conserved recombination signal sequences (RSSs)1 that flank the genomic regions to be rearranged. Each RSS consists of a conserved heptamer and nonamer sequence separated by a 12- or 23-base pair spacer, the sequence of which is poorly conserved. Efficient recombination occurs generally between an RSS containing a 12-base pair spacer (12RSS) and one containing a 23-base pair spacer (23RSS), a requirement referred to as the 12/23 rule. The recombination process is often divided into two phases, the first phase of which consists of two distinct enzymatic steps catalyzed by the RAG proteins. The first step involves the binding of a RAG1-RAG2 complex to an RSS and the subsequent generation of a nick between the heptamer and its adjacent coding strand. The resulting 3′-OH group then performs a nucleophilic attack on the phosphodiester bond of the opposite strand. The primary products of this transesterification reaction are a covalently sealed hairpin, referred to as the coding end, and a blunt-ended 5′ phosphorylated RSS, referred to as the signal end (2McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C.

Science. 1996; 271: 1592-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In the physiological reaction, coupled cleavage likely occurs on a 12- and 23RSS held in a precleavage complex by the RAG proteins. The hairpin formation step, in particular, seems to be highly restricted to the synaptic complex (4Eastman Q.M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4370-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5West R.B. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6408-6415Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Yu K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7914-7921Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The second phase of the reaction is governed by an array of enzymes that catalyze the opening and processing of the coding-end hairpins (1Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Processed coding ends are then joined, most likely by DNA ligase IV with XRCC4, resulting in the ligation of two formerly distant regions of the genome (7Grawunder U. Zimmer D. Fugmann S. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 477-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 8Grawunder U. Zimmer D. Kulesza P. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24708-24714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The signal ends are also joined to form a precise heptamer/heptamer junction. Less is understood about the precise role played by the RAG proteins in the second phase of V(D)J recombination. Studies have shown that the RAG proteins remain bound to the signal and coding ends in a post-cleavage complex, possibly to stabilize and direct the appropriate joining of cleaved ends (9Agrawal A. Schatz D.G. Cell. 1997; 89: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 10Hiom K. Gellert M. Mol.

Proteins that function in double-strand DNA-break repair through the nonhomologous end-joining pathway (e.g. Ku70, Ku80, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, and the recently identified protein Artemis (14Moshous D. Callebaut I. de Chasseval R. Corneo B. Cavazzana-Calvo M. Le Deist F. Tezcan I. Sanal O. Bertrand Y. Philippe N. Fischer A. de Villartay J.-P. Cell. 2001; 105: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar)) are also essential for the processing and joining reactions (reviewed in Ref. 15Grawunder U. Harfst E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although the first phase of V(D)J recombination has been well defined mechanistically, many questions remain concerning the RAG proteins and the nature of the protein-protein and protein-DNA complexes responsible for the DNA cleavage reaction. The investigation of these proteins was facilitated by the identification of the catalytically active regions of the RAG proteins, termed the core regions, which include residues 384–1008 (of 1040 total residues) in murine RAG1 and residues 1–387 (of 527 total residues) in murine RAG2 (1Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). These core regions, capable of achieving effective recombination when expressed together, are more soluble than their parent full-length proteins and therefore have been the focal points for the majority of subsequent research. A multisubunit complex consisting of both RAG1 and RAG2 is required for cleavage of the RSS to yield first nicks and then hairpinned coding ends. Recognition and binding to the RSS seems to be largely mediated by RAG1. For instance, the RSS nonamer-binding site is localized to the N terminus of core RAG1 (residues 384–460) (16Spanopoulou E. Zaitseva F. Wang F.-H. Santagata S. Baltimore D. Panayotou G. Cell. 1996; 87: 263-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 17Difilippantonio M.J. McMahan C.J. Eastman Q.M. Spanopoulou E. Schatz D.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, protein-DNA crosslinking studies showed that core RAG1 formed specific contacts with the RSS heptamer in the presence of RAG2 (18Swanson P.C. Desiderio S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Eastman Q.M. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7025-7031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays have demonstrated that core RAG1 bound to an isolated RSS in the absence of RAG2 and that this binding was specific for both the heptamer and the nonamer (21Rodgers K.K. Villey I.J. Ptaszek L. Corbett E. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2938-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,22Aidinis V. Bonaldi T. Beltrame M. Santagata S. Bianchi M.E. Spanopoulou E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6532-6542Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although the region of RAG1 responsible for RSS nonamer recognition has been identified and shown to be homologous to the DNA-binding domain of Hin recombinase (16Spanopoulou E. Zaitseva F. Wang F.-H. Santagata S. Baltimore D. Panayotou G. Cell. 1996; 87: 263-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), the region of core RAG1 responsible for heptamer recognition has not yet been identified. In addition to its ability to recognize an isolated RSS, RAG1 has been shown recently to possess a triad of acidic residues (Asp-600, Asp-708, and Glu-962, known as the DDE motif) that are essential for the endonucleolytic activities catalyzed by the RAG proteins (23Kim D.R. Dai Y. Mundy C.L. Yang W. Oettinger M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3070-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 24Fugmann S.D. Villey I.J. Ptaszek L.M. Schatz D.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Landree M.A. Wibbenmeyer J.A. Roth D.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3059-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These residues are believed to coordinate 1–2 divalent metal cations, as is characteristic of other enzymes containing the DDE motif (26Rice P.A. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 302-307Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Interaction between RAG1 and RAG2 has been shown to occur in the absence of DNA, suggesting that the two proteins bind to the RSS as a preformed complex (27Santagata S. Aidinis V. Spanopoulou E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16325-16331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, regions within core RAG1 mediate protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that are essential for the V(D)J recombination reaction. We propose that individual domains in the core region contribute each RAG1 binding activity and that these domains, as isolated modules, may retain their ability to form macromolecular interactions. To determine this possibility, we used limited proteolysis studies to identify and then characterize structural, or topologically independent, domains within core RAG1. The results from this study demonstrate that core RAG1 consists of multiple domains, each of which functions individually in one or more of the essential macromolecular interactions formed by the intact core protein. Fragments of the murineRAG1 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers that introduced a BamHI site at the 5′ end of the product and two stop codons and a SalI site at the 3′ end of the product. A gene encoding for an MBP fusion protein was created by inserting the appropriate RAG1 fragment into theBamHI and SalI sites of the multiple cloning site of pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs). Fusion proteins of residues 714–1008, 528–1008, 528–760, 761–1008, and 761–980 to MBP were encoded by plasmids pRS1, pRS2, pRS3, pRS4, and pJLA1, respectively. The fusion proteins listed above as well as MBP fused to core RAG1 were expressed inEscherichia coli and released by sonication as described previously (21Rodgers K.K. Villey I.J. Ptaszek L. Corbett E. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2938-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The proteins were bound to an amylose column in purification buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 μm ZnCl2, 10% glycerol, and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) plus 500 mm NaCl, the column was washed with purification buffer plus 1.5 m NaCl, and the fusion proteins were eluted from the column in purification buffer plus 500 mm NaCl and 10 mm maltose. In some applications, the proteins were purified further through a Q-Sepharose fast flow column, eluting with a NaCl gradient of 0.1–0.6m in purification buffer. In the last purification step the fusion proteins were chromatographed through a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using purification buffer plus 500 mm NaCl. Fractions containing the fusion protein were pooled, concentrated, and stored either at −80 °C or in 50% glycerol at −20 °C. Each protein was judged to be >95% pure by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels. GST-core RAG2, expressed by transfection in 293T cells, was purified as described previously (16Spanopoulou E. Zaitseva F. Wang F.-H. Santagata S. Baltimore D. Panayotou G. Cell. 1996; 87: 263-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A 5–10-μg sample of purified MBP-core RAG1 was incubated with increasing concentrations of porcine pancreatic trypsin (Sigma) ranging from 0.05 to 1.00 μg at 4 °C for 2 h in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol, 25 μmZnCl2, and 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The reactions then were resolved on a 12% polyacrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.), and analyzed by N-terminal sequencing at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Molecular Biology Resource Facility. The lengths of the degradation products (generated during the purification of MBP fusion proteins with RAG1 fragments 500–1008 and 760–1008) were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Each purified fusion protein was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 μmZnCl2 and analyzed at the National Science Foundation Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research Oklahoma Laser Mass Spectrometry facility. The fusion proteins were combined with sinapinic acid, spotted onto a grid, and analyzed by the Voyager Elite MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was blocked with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in interaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 μmZnCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times with interaction buffer, and 200 ng of the appropriate MBP fusion plus 200 ng of GST-core RAG2 or GST in interaction buffer were added to the resin. The samples were incubated on the resin for 30 min at 4 °C. After three interaction buffer washes with interaction buffer, the bound protein was eluted from the resin with SDS loading buffer. The proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gel) and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Two gels were run in parallel to enable Western analysis of both MBP and GST proteins. After transfer, the membrane was blocked for 2 h in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TTBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). Next, the membranes were incubated with the respective primary antibody for 1 h (MBP, rabbit polyclonal anti-MBP, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; GST, mouse monoclonal anti-GST, Berkeley Antibody Co.) followed by a biotinylated secondary antibody for 1 h and avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase for 45 min. Detection was done using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by exposure to Kodak X-OMAT film. The various 12RSS substrates used were prepared by annealing complementary oligonucleotides. The sequence of the top strand of the WT12RSS is d(GATATGGCTCGTCTTACACAGTGATATAGACCTTAACAAAAACCTCCAATCGAGCGGAG). The MH12RSS oligonucleotide sequence is identical to that of the WT12RSS except that the heptamer sequence (CACAGTG) has been replaced by the sequence GAGAAGC. Similarly, the mutated nonamer 12RSS contains the sequence AGGCTCTGA in place of the WT nonamer sequence (ACAAAAACC). Substrates were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, where indicated, using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Fusion proteins of each core RAG1 domain with MBP were incubated with32P-labeled WT12RSS and resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel as described (21Rodgers K.K. Villey I.J. Ptaszek L. Corbett E. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2938-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The binding buffer contained 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 6% glycerol, and 100 mmNaCl. Each reaction contained 0.5 μm of a 24-base single-stranded nonspecific competitor, d(TACGATGAAGGATCCGTCCGGGAA). Protein-DNA specificity assays, also referred to here as competition assays, were performed in the same binding buffer described above. The two domains were added to reactions containing 1 nm 32P-labeled WT12RSS and 0–50 nm of the indicated unlabeled competitor. Each reaction contains either 1.0 μm central domain or 0.5 μm C-terminal domain, as indicated. The bands on the autoradiograms from different exposures were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics SI densitometer and ImageQuaNT software. To identify domain boundaries within core RAG1, a fusion protein between MBP and core RAG1 (MBP-core RAG1) was digested with increasing concentrations of trypsin under limiting conditions (Fig. 1A). By limiting the reaction conditions the initial cleavage events occur primarily at the more accessible regions of the protein. The initial products generated by tryptic cleavage are core RAG1 and MBP, consistent with the presence of the long flexible linker (including 10 consecutive asparagine residues) connecting the two tethered proteins. ProductsA–D are the result of further digestion of core RAG1, because this band is diminished with increasing amounts of trypsin, whereas the intensity of the MBP band remains relatively constant. N-terminal sequencing of these products indicated that cleavage had occurred primarily C-terminal to residues Arg-529, Arg-713, and Lys-777 (Fig. 1B). (All RAG1 residue numbers referred to in this study are from the full-length murine RAG1 sequence.) The molecular mass (and length) of each product was estimated by comparison of molecular mass standards with SDS-PAGE. With this combined information, the order of progression of the digestion of core RAG1 can be inferred from Fig. 1A. For instance, productsA and B are formed readily at lower concentrations of trypsin. Product A appears to become further proteolyzed to product D, whereas productB does not appear to significantly degrade further with increasing concentrations of trypsin. Finally, product Conly appears at the highest concentrations of trypsin, apparently as intact core RAG1 is further proteolyzed. Limited proteolysis of MBP-core RAG1 was also performed with thermolysin, yielding similar results to those shown in Fig. 1 (data not shown). This confirms that cleavage at the basic residues listed above is caused by increased accessibility in those regions of the protein and not strictly by enzyme specificity. It is important to note that the tryptic fragments generated above may or may not represent topologically independent domains. Although the limited proteolytic reaction would restrict cleavage to the most accessible regions of the protein, the protease may also cleave at exposed loops in the protein that do not represent domain boundaries. To establish valid domain boundaries within core RAG1, we performed the following iterative procedure. First, regions of the core RAG1 gene were cloned based on the tryptic cleavage results. Second, the corresponding regions of the core RAG1 protein were expressed and purified as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Finally, whether the purified fragments of RAG1 represented structural and functional domains of the intact core protein was assessed. For clarity here, structural and functional domains represent regions that fold autonomously and perform functions similar to those characterized previously for the intact core RAG1 protein. The assignment of structural, or topologically independent, domains was based on the ability of the protein fragments to form discrete species (monomeric or dimeric) as determined by size-exclusion chromatography. The benchmark for assessing whether the protein regions represented functional domains of core RAG1 was based on the ability of the protein fragments to achieve one or more of the macromolecular interactions attributed to RAG1 in the V(D)J recombination reaction. As outlined in detail below, the purification of core RAG1 fragments fused to MBP twice resulted in proteolysis from endogenous E. coliproteases, which appeared to occur during cell lysis (data not shown). This proved to be advantageous in both instances, because the resulting products had an increased ability to form distinct monomeric or dimeric species (see following text). Although cleavage at the N terminus of each of the fusion proteins was possible in these cases, such cleavage would have removed significant portions of the MBP required to bind substrate (and the amylose column), because an N-terminal loop including residues 1–20 contains important contacts to the substrate in the binding pocket (28Spurlino J.C. Lu G.Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Had cleavage occurred at the N terminus of the fusion protein, the cleaved protein would not have been recovered from the purification protocol used in these studies. The degradation products were identified as described in the following section, and the procedure outlined above was repeated. Based on the identified tryptic cleavage sites, two fragments of RAG1 (residues 528–1008 and 714–1008) were cloned as fusions to MBP. Purification of the MBP fusion with RAG1 residues 528–1008 (N528a) resulted in a degradation product that was topologically independent based on its elution from size-exclusion chromatography as a distinct single species. In contrast, the full-length protein (N528a) eluted entirely in the void volume indicative of misfolded and/or nonspecifically aggregated protein, perhaps resulting from solvent-exposed hydrophobic regions that are typically buried in the intact core protein. Analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry indicated that the degradation product was ∼250 residues smaller than N528a (Fig. 2A), corresponding to truncation of the fusion protein at RAG1 residue 760. A fusion protein of MBP with RAG1 residues 528–760 (N528b) was then produced and, based on its ability to form a discrete species, appears to exist as a topologically independent domain. With the identification of a structural domain that spans residues 528–760, we subsequently cloned the region encoding residues 761–1008 into the pMAL-c2 plasmid. In purifying the fusion protein of MBP to RAG1 residues 761–1008 (N761a) the full-length fusion protein was mostly misfolded and aggregated. However, as seen in the purification of N528a, proteolysis had occurred at the C terminus of the fusion protein, producing cleavage products that formed autonomously folded modules based on size-exclusion chromatography. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of these products (Fig. 2B) indicated that cleavage had occurred at the residues indicated. To be conservative in the establishment of our domain boundary, we chose the largest of the products to further characterize. Purification of a fusion protein of residues 761–980 (N761b) resulted in a proteolytically resistant, topologically independent domain capable of forming distinct monomeric and dimeric species (see the following text and Fig. 3). The fragment consisting of RAG1 residues 714–1008 was cloned as a fusion to MBP, purified, and characterized as outlined above. The fusion protein was entirely aggregated with the formation of no obvious degradation products. Although these observations do not preclude Arg-713 as a valid domain boundary, we chose not to pursue this site as an N-terminal domain boundary. Although tryptic cleavage at residue 530 suggested the presence of an N-terminal domain between residues 384 and 529 of RAG1, no protease-resistant fragments in this region of the core remained after limited tryptic digestion. As a result, we were unable to establish the boundaries of an N-terminal domain. The N-terminal region of the core contains a putative helix-loop-helix motif that has been shown to form specific interactions with the RSS nonamer (16Spanopoulou E. Zaitseva F. Wang F.-H.

Schatz D.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is possible that in the absence of DNA this region may be relatively unstructured and thus more susceptible to tryptic cleavage. Nevertheless, an isolated fragment of core RAG1 containing the nonamer-binding region has been shown previously to bind specifically to the RSS nonamer (16Spanopoulou E. Zaitseva F. Wang F.-H. Santagata S. Baltimore D. Panayotou G. Cell. 1996; 87: 263-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), indicating that an N-terminal domain does exist in core RAG1, although its boundaries are not yet well defined. However, because the function of this region of core RAG1 has been characterized fairly well, we chose to focus our studies on N528b and N761b, hereafter referred to as the central and C-terminal domains, respectively (Fig. 2C). It should be noted that these two domains correspond fairly well with the trypsin-generated fragments B and C in Fig.1. In our domain model the central domain contains a zinc finger motif, referred to as ZFB, as well as the two aspartate catalytic active site residues (Asp-600 and Asp-708) of the DDE triad. The third active site residue (Glu-962) is located in the C-terminal domain. This domain model is supported further by the ability of each domain to form macromolecular complexes essential to V(D)J recombination (see the following figures). In the experiments performed in these studies, both domains were expressed as fusion proteins to MBP. It was shown previously that MBP-core RAG1 is predominantly dimeric in solution (21Rodgers K.K. Villey I.J. Ptaszek L. Corbett E. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2938-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To assess the self-association properties of the individual core RAG1 domains, each purified domain (fused to MBP) was analyzed using size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3). By comparing the elution profiles of each independent domain to those of known molecular mass standards, the molecular mass of each eluted species was determined. The elution profile of the central domain resulted in one major peak. The molecular mass of this eluted species indicated that this domain persists predominantly as a monomer (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the elution profile of the C-terminal domain indicated the presence of two distinct species (Fig. 3B). When compared with the elution profiles of known standards, it is clear that the first of the two peaks represents a dimer, and the second represents a monomer. The C-terminal domain therefore represents a dimerization domain that most likely contributes to the self-association properties of core"

CS proteoglycans (CSPGs) consist of a core protein to which one or more CS chains are attached via a serine residue. Although several brain CSPGs, including mouse DSD-1-PG/phosphacan, have been found to contain the oversulfated D disaccharide motif, no brain CSPG has been reported to contain the oversulfated E motif. Here we analyzed the CS chain of appican, the CSPG form of the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein. Appican is expressed almost exclusively by astrocytes and has been reported to have brain- and astrocyte-specific functions including stimulation of both neural cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth. The present findings show that the CS chain of appican has a molecular mass of 25–50 kDa. This chain contains a significant fraction (14.3%) of the oversulfated E motif GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate). The rest of the chain consists of GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate) (81.2%) and minor fractions of GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc and GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate). We also show that the CS chain of appican contains in its linkage region the 4-O-sulfated Gal structure. Thus, appican is the first example of a specific brain CSPG that contains the E disaccharide unit in its sugar backbone and the 4-O-sulfated Gal residue in its linkage region. The presence of the E unit is consistent with and may explain the neurotrophic activities of appican.

The core protein of appican belongs to a group of APP isoforms, termed L-APP, that lacks the peptide sequence corresponding to exon 15 (4). Fusion of exon 14 to exon 16 creates a consensus amino acid sequence containing the specific serine residue for the attachment of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain (4Pangalos M.N. Efthimiopoulos S.

L-APPs are “part-time PGs,” because they occur in both PG (appican) and non-PG forms. Appican is found in human and rat brains and in primary cultures of rat astrocytes (5Shioi J. Pangalos M.N.

It has been reported that appican promotes adhesion of primary astrocytes and neural cell lines including rat glioblastoma C6, mouse neuroblastoma N2a, and rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells but fails to promote adhesion of fibroblast cells. The cell adhesion function of appican is mainly due to the CS chain (6Wu A. Pangalos M.N. Efthimiopoulos S. Shioi J. Robakis N.K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4987-4993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Despite the large number of CSPGs identified in vertebrate brains, the structure of the CS chains attached to individual core proteins has not been rigorously investigated, and presently no specific examples of brain CSPGs are known that contain the oversulfated E disaccharide units (reviewed in Ref. 39Oohira A. Matsui F. Tokita Y. Yamauchi S. Aono S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Here we report the analysis of the chemical composition of the CS chain of appican. Our data show that appican constitutes the first example of a specific brain CSPG that contains the E disaccharide motif. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with and may explain the neurotrophic activities of appican. Thus, in addition to being a potential precursor of the Alzheimer's amyloid peptide, appican may affect the neuropathology of AD by acting as a neurotrophic factor for the abnormal neurite outgrowth observed in this disorder. Preliminary findings of this work have been reported in abstract form (40Tsuchida, K., Takahashi, Y., Yamada, S., Sugahara, K., Shioi, J., Boghosian, G., Wu, A., Gai, H., and Robakis, N. K.

Appican was purified essentially as described in our previous report (1Shioi J. Anderson J.P. Ripellino J.A. Robakis N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13819-13822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, rat C6 glioma cells transfected with the L-APP cDNA (6Wu A. Pangalos M.N. Efthimiopoulos S. Shioi J. Robakis N.K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4987-4993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with supplements. Secreted appican, which consists of recombinant and endogenous molecular species, was purified from the conditioned culture medium by column chromatographies using dextran sulfate and Poros HQ/F anion exchange resin (PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA). Chondroitinase digest of the final preparation showed a single band in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis stained with Gelcode stain (Pierce) and was quantified with a reference of varying amounts of bovine serum albumin within the same gel. Approximately 0.6 mg of purified appican was obtained from a 7-liter culture. Purified APP was also collected in other fractions of the same anion exchange column as mentioned above. The following authentic tetra- and hexasaccharides were obtained from whale cartilage CS-A as reported (42Sakaguchi H. Watanabe M. Ueoka C. Sugiyama E. Taketomi T. Yamada S. Sugahara K. J. Biochem.

Other materials were obtained from the following sources: chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4), chondroitinase AC-II (EC 4.2.2.5), chondro-4-O-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.9), and chondro-6-O-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.10) from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan) and 2-aminobenzamide (2AB) from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). The purified appican (30 μg containing 20 μg of the core protein) was treated with 0.5 m LiOH at 4 °C for 16 h to liberateO-linked saccharides including GAG chains from the core protein APP (42Sakaguchi H.

After neutralization with 1 m acetic acid, the sample was applied to a column (300 μl) of anion exchange resin AG 50W-X2 (H+ form; Bio-Rad) equilibrated with water. The flow-through fraction containing the liberated O-linked saccharides was pooled, neutralized with 1 mNH4HCO3, and derivatized with 2AB. Derivatization of the saccharides with a fluorophore 2AB was performed as previously reported (44Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The 2AB-derivatives were then subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex peptide column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 20 mm CH3COONH4, pH 7.5, as an effluent at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluates were monitored by fluorescence with excitation and emission wavelengths at 330 and 420 nm, respectively. The flow-through fraction containing 2AB-derivatized GAG chains was pooled and lyophilized. Approximately 55 pmol of high molecular weight 2AB derivatives were obtained from 30 μg of appican. Enzymatic digestion with chondroitinase ABC was carried out using 5 mIU of the enzyme and 5 pmol of the 2AB-derivatized polysaccharide or 1 μg of appican in a total volume of 20 μl of 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.05 m sodium acetate at 37 °C for 20 min (45Yamagata T.

Chondroitinase AC-II digestion of the linkage hexasaccharides or 1 μg of appican was conducted using 5 mIU of the enzyme in a total volume of 30 μl of 0.03 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, at 37 °C for 10 min (45Yamagata T. Saito H. Habuchi O. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1523-1535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chondro-4-O-sulfatase or chondro-6-O-sulfatase digestion of the linkage hexasaccharides (5 pmol) was carried out using 20 mIU of the enzyme in a total volume of 30 μl of 0.04 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.04 m sodium acetate and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, at 37 °C for 2 h (46Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated by heating at 100 °C for 1 min. Each digest was treated with a 0.45-μm C3HV membrane filter (Millipore), and an aliquot was subjected to HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA03 column (4.6 × 250 mm) (YMC Co., Kyoto, Japan) using a linear gradient of NaH2PO4 from 16 to 530 mm over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluates were monitored by fluorescence intensity with excitation and emission wavelengths of 330 and 420 nm or by absorbance at 232 nm (44Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of a chondroitinase digest of our appican preparation followed by dye staining yielded only one core protein at 110 kDa (data not shown; see also Ref. 1Shioi J. Anderson J.P. Ripellino J.A. Robakis N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13819-13822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein reacted with anti-APP antibodies that show no reactivity toward amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2). Because the core protein of APLP2 PG has an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mobility distinct from the appican core protein (47Pangalos M.N. Shioi J. Robakis N.K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 48Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22099-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our preparation had no significant contamination of the APLP2 PG (see also Ref. 47Pangalos M.N. Shioi J. Robakis N.K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). APP, but not the APLP2, sequence was found in the core protein of our appican preparations from C6 cells following chondroitinase digestion (1Shioi J. Anderson J.P. Ripellino J.A. Robakis N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13819-13822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified appican was treated with LiOH to liberate GAGs from the core protein. Liberated saccharides were then labeled with a fluorophore 2AB, and most of the labeled sugar chains were recovered in the flow-through fraction on gel filtration using a Superdex peptide column (data not shown). The flow-through fractions containing 2AB-labeled GAG chains were pooled and digested exhaustively with chondroitinase ABC. The resultant disaccharides were labeled again with 2AB and analyzed by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column. Mono- and disulfated disaccharide peaks, designated I and II, were detected at the elution positions of 2AB derivatives of ΔDi-4S and ΔDi-diSE, respectively (Fig.1A). Minor peaks eluted at the positions of 2AB-labeled ΔDi-0S and ΔDi-6S were also detected. When the obtained disaccharides were digested further with chondro-6-O-sulfatase, the disulfated disaccharide peak II was shifted to the elution position of 2AB-labeled ΔDi-4S (Fig.1B). The disulfated disaccharide peak II was resistant to the action of chondro-4-O-sulfatase, whereas the monosulfated peak I was shifted to the elution position of 2AB-labeled ΔDi-0S by the enzyme treatment, confirming that the predominant components in the disaccharide peaks I and II were 2AB-labeled ΔDi-4S and ΔDi-diSE, respectively (Fig. 1C) (46Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The disaccharide composition of the appican CS determined by the analysis is summarized in Table I. The predominant component was ΔDi-4S, accounting for 81.2%, with a considerable proportion (14.3%) of ΔDi-diSE. Trace amounts of the minor components, ΔDi-0S and ΔDi-6S, were also detected (Table I). ΔDi-diSE has also been detected in DS chains of various tissues after chondroitinase ABC digestion and has attracted attention (reviewed in Refs. 29Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci.

However, because chondroitinase ABC and AC-II digests of appican showed identical HPLC profiles (data not shown), it is concluded that appican contains CS-E but not DS-E (CS-H) (50Anno K. Seno N.

Open table in a new tab Disaccharide composition was determined by enzymatic digestion with chondroitinase ABC followed by HPLC analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To examine whether the CS chains of appican with oversulfated units also contain 3-O-sulfated GlcUA residues (49Kinoshita A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19656-19665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we took advantage of the differential susceptibility of 3-O-sulfated GlcUA to chondroitinases ABC and AC-II. Oligosaccharide chains containing this sugar residue are decomposed by chondroitinase ABC treatment but are resistant to chondroitinase AC-II (52Sugahara K. Tanaka Y. Yamada S. Seno N. Kitagawa H.

However, as described above, we detected no difference in the HPLC profiles of chondroitinase ABC and AC-II digests of appican, indicating that the appican CS chain did not contain a 3-O-sulfated GlcUA residue (data not shown). CS-E from squid cartilage is known to be occasionally branched with glucose residues (53Habuchi O. Sugiura K. Kawai N. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4570-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a Glc-containing trisaccharide (ΔHexUAα1–3(Glcβ1–6)GalNAc(4S)) 2A. Kinoshita, T. Nakamura, and K. Sugahara, unpublished results.and pentasaccharides such as ΔHexUAα1–3(Glcβ1–6)GalNAc(4S)β1–4GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4S, 6S) have been isolated after digestion with chondroitinases ABC or AC-II (53Habuchi O.

(1998) XIXth International Carbohydrate Symposium, San Diego, CA, August 9–14, 1998, abstract AP077, International Carbohydrate OrganizationGoogle Scholar). In our HPLC system, the above trisaccharide labeled with 2AB is eluted slightly ahead of and separable from 2AB-labeled ΔDi-6S.2 In this study, no such trisaccharide or the above mentioned pentasaccharide was detected, indicating that the appican CS is not branched with Glc. The 2AB-GAG fraction obtained from Superdex peptide column chromatography after LiOH treatment of appican was subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a column of Superdex 200. Because of limited amounts of materials, no signal was detected in the eluted fractions by direct fluorescence measurement (data not shown). Therefore, each fraction from the gel filtration chromatography was digested with chondroitinase ABC and labeled with 2AB, and the resultant 2AB-disaccharides were analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 2B). The gel filtration profile of the 2AB-derivatives of disaccharides showed that the molecular mass of the appican CS was similar to that of the commercial whale cartilage CS-A (Fig. 2A), which has been reported to be 25–50 kDa by the manufacturer. Both 2AB-labeled ΔDi-4S and ΔDi-diSE gave similar chromatographic profiles (Fig. 2B), suggesting that both disaccharide units were derived from a common CS chain. To characterize the CS protein linkage hexasaccharide, the appican CS chain was first liberated with LiOH, labeled with 2AB, and then treated with chondroitinase ABC to digest the repeating disaccharide region. The resultant linkage hexasaccharides were analyzed by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two predominant peaks, designated Iabc and IIabc, were observed at the elution positions of the authentic 2AB-hexasaccharides, ΔHexUAα1–3GalNAc(4S)β1–4GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-2AB and ΔHexUAα1–3GalNAc(4S)β1–4GlcUAβ1–3Gal(4S)β1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-2AB, respectively, in a molar ratio of 0.36:0.64 (Fig.3A). When this sample was co-chromatographed with the standard linkage hexasaccharides, these peaks were co-eluted with the corresponding standards (data not shown). Upon subsequent chondro-4-O-sulfatase digestion, both peaks of this sample shifted to the elution position of the authentic nonsulfated 2AB-hexasaccharide, ΔHexUAα1–3GalNAcβ1–4GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-2AB (Fig. 3B), indicating that peaks Iabc and IIabc contained one and two 4-O-sulfate groups in the linkage hexasaccharide structure, respectively. The identical sulfated structures were previously detected in the linkage region hexasaccharides isolated from whale cartilage CS chains (55Sugahara K. Masuda M. Harada T. Yamashina I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To further identify the tetrasaccharide core structures of the linkage region, the 2AB-GAGs were digested first with chondroitinases ABC and then with AC-II. The resultant enzyme digests were analyzed by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column. Two predominant peaks, designated Iac and IIac, were observed at the elution positions of the authentic 2AB-tetrasaccharides, ΔHexUAα1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-2AB and ΔHexUAα1–3Gal(4S)β1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-2AB, respectively, in a molar ratio of 0.36:0.64 (Fig.4A). Their molar ratio was in good agreement with that obtained for the 2AB-hexasaccharide peaks Iabc and IIabc, indicating that peaks Iac and IIac were derived from peaks Iabc and IIabc, respectively. Furthermore, peaks Iac and IIac were co-chromatographed with the corresponding standards (data not shown), confirming their structural identities. Upon subsequent digestion with chondro-4-O-sulfatase, peak IIac was shifted to the elution position of ΔHexUAα1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-2AB as expected (Fig. 4B). Together, these findings indicate that the hexasaccharide linkage region of appican is primarily composed of the structures summarized in Table II. We detected no 2-O-phosphorylation of the linkage Xyl residue of appican, although this structure has been detected in the linkage region of other PGs containing CS and heparin/HS (56Sugahara K.

However, the NO so formed has been found to auto-inhibit the enzymatic activity significantly. We hypothesized that the NO reactivity is in part controlled by hydrogen bonding between the conserved tryptophan residue (position 409 in the neuronal isoform of NOS (nNOS)) and the cysteine residue that forms the proximal bond to the heme. By using resonance Raman spectroscopy and NO as a probe of the heme environment, we show that in the W409F and W409Y mutants of the oxygenase domain of the neuronal enzyme (nNOSox), the Fe-NO bond in the Fe3+NO complex is weaker than in the wild type enzyme, consistent with the loss of a hydrogen bond on the sulfur atom of the proximal cysteine residue. The weaker Fe-NO bond in the W409F and W409Y mutants might result in a faster rate of NO dissociation from the ferric heme in the Trp-409 mutants as compared with the wild type enzyme, which could contribute to the lower accumulation of the inhibitory NO-bound complexes observed during catalysis with the Trp-409 mutants (Adak, S., Crooks, C., Wang, Q., Crane, B.

The optical and resonance Raman spectra of the Fe2+NO complexes of the Trp-409 mutants differ from those of the wild type enzyme and indicate that a significant population of a five-coordinate Fe2+NO complex is present. These data show that the hydrogen bond provided by the Trp-409 residue is necessary to maintain the thiolate coordination when NO binds to the ferrous heme. Taken together our results indicate that the heme environment on the proximal side of nNOS is critical for the formation of a stable iron-cysteine bond and for the control of the electronic properties of heme-NO complexes.

Each class of heme protein is well adapted to carry out its particular function through the optimization of the environment of the heme pocket, both on the proximal and distal side of the heme. Nitric oxide synthases (NOSs),1 like cytochrome P450 and chloroperoxidase, belong to the family of thiolate-coordinated heme proteins in which the proximal ligand to the heme iron is the sulfur atom of a cysteine residue (4Feldman P.L.

NO is synthesized at the heme active site by two consecutive hydroxylation reactions, each consuming O2 and NADPH; the first reaction results in the oxidation of l-arginine toNω-hydroxy-l-arginine (NOHA), and the second reaction converts NOHA to citrulline and NO (8Griffith O.W.

The amide nitrogens of two surrounding groups also share a hydrogen bond with the sulfur atom (see Fig. 1). This arrangement is similar to that of cytochrome P450 (15Poulos T.L. The Porphyrin Handbook. 4. Academic Press, New York2000: 189-218Google Scholar, 16Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), where the amide nitrogens of the three residues downstream of the proximal cysteine may form hydrogen bonds with the sulfur atom of the proximal cysteine, and chloroperoxidase, where the amide nitrogen of the second and third residues after the cysteine residue along the peptide chain could also share hydrogen bonds with the proximal cysteine residue (15Poulos T.L. The Porphyrin Handbook. 4. Academic Press, New York2000: 189-218Google Scholar) (Fig.1). It was shown from resonance Raman studies that the frequencies of the νFe-CO and νFe-NO-stretching modes are different in chloroperoxidase as compared with cytochrome P450cam (17Hu S. Kincaid J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6189-6193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Differences in the proximal environment of these proteins may contribute to these observations, particularly since the Fe-Cys bond is weaker in ferric chloroperoxidase (νFe-Cys 347 cm−1) (18Bangcharoenpaurpong O. Champion P.M. Hall K.S. Hager L.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2374-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) than in ferric cytochrome P450cam (νFe-Cys 351 cm−1) (19Champion P.M. Stallard B.R. Wagner G.C. Gunsalus I.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 5469-5472Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For nNOS, resonance Raman studies of NO complexes revealed that the Fe-NO frequencies are more similar to those of chloroperoxidase than those of cytochrome P450cam (20Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10512-10516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which indicates that the proximal environment of NOS might be more similar to chloroperoxidase than cytochrome P450. The importance of the hydrogen bonds to the axial cysteine in controlling the electron-donating properties of the sulfur atom and in controlling the electronic properties of heme-bound ligands is essentially unknown, as it is difficult experimentally to alter these hydrogen bonds in cytochrome P450 and in chloroperoxidase. However, those studies are possible in NOS by replacing the tryptophan residue at position 409. Adak et al. (21Adak S. Crooks C. Wang Q. Crane B.R. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

It is possible that the structure and the reactivity of heme-ligand complexes were altered due to an increase in the electron density of the sulfur group caused by the mutations. To determine the effect of the Trp-409 mutation on the structure and electronic properties of heme-ligand complexes of NOS, we have used resonance Raman spectroscopy to characterize the heme pocket of the W409F and the W409Y mutants of the oxygenase domain of nNOS (nNOSox).1 We show that the spectra of the Trp-409 mutants in the exogenous ligand-free ferric state are similar to those of the wild type enzyme, which suggests that the mutations did not cause large structural changes in the heme pocket. However, the electronic properties of the complexes formed between the heme iron and NO in the Trp-409 mutants of the ferric state differ from those of the wild type enzyme and reveal the importance of the Trp-409 residue in controlling the amount of electron donation from the sulfur atom of the proximal cysteine residue to the heme iron. We also show the importance of the Trp-409 residue in the stabilization of the thiolate bond in NO complexes with the ferrous heme. (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (H4B) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). l-Arginine, dl-dithiothreitol, EPPS, and CHES buffers were purchased from Sigma. 14N16O and N2 gases were from Tech Air (White Plains, NY), and15N16O gas was from Icon (Mt. Marion, NY). Wild type nNOSox and the single amino acid mutants at position 409 (W409Y and W409F) were expressed inEscherichia coli from the cloned cDNAs and were purified as previously described in the absence of l-arginine and H4B (23Abu-Soud H.M. Ichimori K. Presta A. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17349-17357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When required, l-arginine and H4B were added to the purified enzyme in a 100- and 3–5-fold excess concentration over heme, respectively. The incubation of the enzymes with the substrate and cofactor were performed at room temperature for ∼12 h. The binding of these compounds was followed by optical spectroscopy from the change in the spin state of the ferric enzyme (24Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The enzyme preparations were then either used immediately or kept in liquid nitrogen in buffer containing 10% glycerol. The buffers used for the spectroscopy measurements were 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm dl-dithiothreitol and 40 mmCHES, pH 9–9.5, containing 1 mm dl-dithiothreitol. Fe3+NO complexes were prepared by adding NO gas to the various proteins made anaerobic by equilibration with nitrogen gas in an anaerobic cell. Fe2+NO complexes were prepared by adding sodium dithionite to the Fe3+NO complexes. Optical spectra were recorded at room temperature with a Shimadzu UV2100U spectrophotometer. Samples used for resonance Raman spectroscopy were prepared as described above. The output at 406 nm from a krypton ion laser (Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CA) or at 442 nm from a helium/cadmium laser (Liconix, Santa Clara, CA), 3–10 milliwatts, was used to obtain spectra of samples placed in a cell rotating at ∼3000 rpm to avoid local heating. The scattered light was collected and focused on the entrance slit (100 μm) of a 1.25-m SPEX spectrometer (Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ) and was detected with a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Princeton, NJ). All measurements were done at room temperature (∼25 °C). The resonance Raman spectra were calibrated with the lines of indene. Cosmic ray lines were removed from the spectra by a routine in the Winspec software (Roper Scientific, Princeton, NJ). Typically, several 1–2 min spectra were acquired and averaged. We obtained the resonance Raman spectra of the W409Y and W409F mutants in the high frequency region to analyze the structure of the heme pocket. This region of the spectrum is comprised of in-plane vibrational modes of the heme that are sensitive to the oxidation, coordination, and spin-state of the heme iron (25Hu S. Smith K.S. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12638-12646Crossref Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 26Spiro T.G. Li X.Y. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 427-454Google Scholar). The spectra of the W409Y and W409F mutants in the ferric state, recorded in the absence ofl-arginine and H4B, show the presence a single ν4 line at 1372 cm−1, confirming the ferric oxidation state of the heme as this line appears near 1370 cm−1 for various oxidized heme proteins (Fig.2, C and D). Two ν3 lines, with frequencies characteristic of five-coordinate high spin and six-coordinate low spin species are detected at 1488 and 1502 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 2,C and D). In the presence ofl-arginine and H4B, the heme is totally five-coordinate and high spin in both Trp-409 mutants, as shown by the single ν3 line at 1488 cm−1 (Fig. 2,A and B). The line at 1488 cm−1 is also predominant in the spectra of H4B-containing samples, without substrate, showing that H4B is sufficient to convert most of the heme to the five-coordinate high spin form (not shown). These results show that the heme pocket structures of the ferric form of the W409Y and W409F mutants are similar to those of wild type nNOSox (not shown) and full-length nNOS (28Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7080-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which also exhibit a change in the coordination and spin state of the heme upon the binding of H4B and substrate. No resonance Raman studies of the NO complexes of nNOSox have been reported in the past. We first characterized the NO complexes of wild type nNOSox to determine the effect of the Trp-409 mutation on these complexes. The optical spectrum of the Fe3+NO complex of wild type nNOSox has wavelength maxima at 440, 546, and 579 nm (Fig.3C). The resonance Raman spectrum of this complex, recorded in the high frequency region, has a ν4 line at 1376 cm−1 and a ν3line at 1503 cm−1 that are typical of six-coordinate, low spin complexes (not shown). In addition to the heme modes, the low frequency region of the resonance Raman spectra of heme proteins also often contains the vibrational modes associated with the axial ligands of the heme, thus allowing the identification of the ligands coordinated to the heme (26Spiro T.G. Li X.Y. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 1-37Google Scholar,27Wang J. Caughey W.S. Rousseau D.L. Feelisch M. Stamler J. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 427-454Google Scholar). In the low frequency region of the resonance Raman spectra of the Fe3+NO complex of nNOSox, in the absence ofl-arginine and H4B, we detect a line at 535 cm−1 with 14N16O that shifts to 532 cm−1 with 15N16O (Fig.3A, spectra G and H). These lines are observed as a positive peak at 540 cm−1 and as a negative peak at 528 cm−1 in the 14N16O minus 15N16O difference spectrum, (Fig.3A, spectrum I). The frequency of this isotope-sensitive line (535 cm−1) and the magnitude of the isotopic shift (Δν ∼3 cm−1) are similar to those of the νFe-NO-stretching mode of the Fe3+NO complex cytochrome P450cam in the absence of substrate (528 cm−1, Δν ∼4 cm−1), chloroperoxidase (538 cm−1, Δν ∼4 cm−1), and cytochrome P450nor (530 cm−1, Δν ∼5 cm−1) (TableI). We therefore assign the 535 cm−1 line as the νFe-NO-stretching mode of substrate-free and H4B-free nNOSox.Table IFrequencies of vibrational modes of ferric-NO complexes of heme proteinsProteinProximal ligandνFe-NO(15N16O)δFe-N-O (15N16O)nNOSox (−Arg/−H4B)1-aThis work.Cys535 (532)AbsentnNOSox (−Arg/+H4B)1-aThis work.Cys542 (537)AbsentnNOSox (+Arg/+H4B)1-aThis work.Cys546 (536)AbsentW409Y nNOSox (−Arg/−H4B)1-aThis work.Cys529 (524)AbsentW409Y nNOSox (+Arg/+H4B)1-aThis work.Cys539 (531)AbsentW409F nNOSox (−Arg/−H4B)1-aThis work.Cys527 (524)AbsentW409F nNOSox (+Arg/+H4B)1-aThis work.Cys539 (531)AbsentFull-length nNOS (−Arg/+H4B)1-bRefs. 20 and 27.Cys540 (524)1-c15N18O isotope.AbsentFull length nNOS (+Arg/+H4B)1-bRefs. 20 and 27.Cys545AbsentP-450cam (substrate free)1-dRef. 36.Cys528 (524)AbsentP-450cam (+adamatoanone)1-dRef. 36.Cys520542P-450cam (+camphor)1-dRef. 36.Cys522 (520)546 (533)P-450cam (+norcamphor)1-c15N18O isotope.Cys524 (521)AbsentP-450 Bm3 (substrate-free)1-eRef. 49.Cys526548P-450 Bm3 (+palmitate)1-eRef. 49.Cys526548CPO1-fRef. 17.Cys538 (534)558 (546)P450nor1-gRef. 50.Cys530 (525)AbsentMyoglobin1-hRef. 51.His595 (589)573 (562)Horseradish peroxidase1-hRef. 51.His604 (598)574 (464)CPO, chloroperoxidase.1-a This work.1-b Refs. 20Wang J.

Open table in a new tab CPO, chloroperoxidase. In the presence of H4B, the νFe-NO-stretching mode of the Fe3+NO complex of nNOSox is detected at 542 cm−1 with 14N16O (Fig.3A, spectrum E), a frequency higher than that of the νFe-NO-stretching mode of the H4B-free sample (535 cm−1) (Table I). The addition of the substratel-arginine causes a further shift to higher frequency of the νFe-NO-stretching mode, to 546 cm−1(Fig. 3A, spectrum B and Table I). At each set of conditions, in the absence of both substrate and H4B, in the presence of H4B alone, and in the presence of both H4B and substrate, we detected only one isotope-sensitive line as evident from the 14N16O minus15N16O difference spectra (Fig. 3A, spectra C, F, and I). However, we observe differences in the intensity and position of several lines in the resonance Raman spectra recorded in the presence of H4B (Fig. 3A, spectra A, B, D, and E) as compared with the spectra obtained in the absence of H4B (Fig. 3A, spectra G andH). In the presence of H4B, we observe new lines in the 350–410 and the 700–760 cm−1 regions, the disappearance of the line at 716 cm−1, and an increase of the intensity of the line at 685 cm−1. These spectral differences reveal that the heme group underwent significant electronic and/or conformational changes after the binding of H4B. The types of changes we observe are reminiscent of those detected in the comparison between unfolded and native cytochrome c, in which the folding of the polypeptide around the heme causes a distortion away from the planar symmetry that occurs in the unfolded state (25Hu S. Smith K.S. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12638-12646Crossref Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 29Yeh S.-R. Han S. Rousseau D.L. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 727-736Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the binding of H4B restructures the heme pocket, leading to the distortion of the heme in the NO complexes. It is well established that the binding of H4B or the substrate causes a shift to the high spin state of the heme in the ferric, resting state of NOS. Our results now indicate that the electronic/structural changes induced by the binding of H4B are not only significant in the ferric resting state but are also significant in the heme-NO complexes of nNOSox. With the W409F and W409Y mutants, the initial complexes formed after the addition of NO to the ferric enzymes in the absence of H4B and substrate have a Soret band at 436 and 433 nm, respectively, and two visible bands near 543 and 575 nm, indicating that a significant population of ferric six-coordinate NO complex is present (Fig. 3C) (22Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17434-17439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Within several minutes after the addition of NO, this spectrum converts to a species with a Soret band at 395 nm and a single band in the visible region at 555 cm−1. This species corresponds to a five-coordinate Fe2+NO complex that was not further characterized here. 2The resonance Raman spectrum of the stable NO complexes of the W409F and W409Y mutants, obtained in the absence ofl-arginine and H4B, upon the addition of NO to the ferric proteins is typical of five-coordinate ferrous NO complexes with ν4 at 1375 cm−1 and an intense ν3 line at 1508 cm−1 (not shown). We infer that NO is responsible for the reduction of the heme iron, a phenomenon observed previously for other heme proteins such as myoglobin (45Hoshino M. Maeda M. Konishi R. Seki H. Ford P.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5702-5707Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and cytochrome P450 (46Nakano R. Sato H. Watanabe A. Ito O. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8570-8574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). With an excitation source at 442 nm to specifically enhance the initial six-coordinate Fe3+NO complexes, a single isotope-sensitive line was identified at 529 cm−1 with 14N16O (524 cm−1 with 15N16O) for the W409Y mutant (Fig. 3B, spectra D andE) and at 527 cm−1 (524 cm−1 with15N16O) for the W409F mutant (Fig.3B, spectra J and K). These lines are assigned as the νFe-NO-stretching modes of the Fe3+NO complexes of the W409Y and W409F mutants, respectively (Table I). In the presence of H4B andl-arginine, the six-coordinate Fe3+NO complexes of the W409F and W409Y mutants are stable with time. The νFe-NO line of these complexes is identified at 539 cm−1 (531 with 15N16O) in the low frequency region of the spectra of the W409Y and W409F mutants (Fig.3B, spectra A, B, G, andH and Table I). The spectral changes that we observe upon the binding of H4B to wild type nNOSox, namely the appearance of new lines in the 350–410 cm−1 and the 710 to 760 cm−1 regions, the disappearance of the line at 716 cm−1, and the increase of the intensity of the line at 685 cm−1 are also observed in the spectra of H4B-containing samples as compared with the H4B free samples (Fig. 3). The resonance Raman spectrum of the Fe2+NO complex of nNOSox, recorded in the high frequency region in the absence of H4B and substrate (Fig.4B), has a line at 1376 cm−1 assigned to ν4, a line at 1508 cm−1 assigned to ν3, and a line at 1646 cm−1 assigned to ν10. The frequencies of these lines are typical of five-coordinate Fe2+NO complexes of heme proteins (30Reynolds M.F. Parks R.B. Burstyn J.N. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4939-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is known that the six-coordinate Fe2+NO complexes of NOSox proteins are stable only in the presence of H4B or l-arginine; in their absence, the initial six-coordinate complex is unstable and converts with time to a five-coordinate species characterized by wavelength maxima at 394 nm and ∼570 nm (33Abu-Soud H.M. Wu C. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3777-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 34Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As expected, the resonance Raman spectrum of the Fe2+NO complex of H4B-bound nNOSox, recorded in the high frequency region, shows the ν4 line at 1376 cm−1 and the ν3 line at 1497 cm−1, consistent with the formation of a stable six-coordinate species (Fig. 4A). In the low frequency region of the resonance Raman spectrum of the six-coordinate Fe2+NO complex of nNOSox/H4B, we detect a single isotope-sensitive line at 543 cm−1 (528 cm−1 with15N16O) (Fig. 5,D and E, Table II). The frequency of this line is similar to the frequencies of the νFe-NO-stretching modes of Fe2+NO complexes of full-length nNOS, cytochrome P450cam, chloroperoxidase, and cytochrome P450nor (Table II) and is therefore assigned to the νFe-NO-stretching mode of the six-coordinate Fe2+NO complex of nNOSox/H4B. In the presence of l-arginine, the νFe-NO-stretching mode is detected at 549 cm−1 (Fig. 5B, Table II). The increase in the frequency of the νFe-NO-stretching mode observed after the binding of l-arginine shows that the Fe2+NO complex is sensitive to the binding ofl-arginine, most probably due to electrostatic/steric interactions between l-arginine and NO. A similar conclusion was reached from the EPR study of l-arginine binding to the Fe2+NO complex of nNOS (35Migita C.T. Salerno J.C. Masters B.S.S. Martasek P. McMillan K. Ikeda-Saito M.

https://openalex.org/W2049912169,"The native state of human muscle acylphosphatase (AcP) presents two α-helices. In this study we have investigated folding and aggregation of a number of protein variants having mutations aimed at changing the propensity of these helical regions. Equilibrium and kinetic measurements of folding indicate that only helix-2, spanning residues 55–67, is largely stabilized in the transition state for folding therefore playing a relevant role in this process. On the contrary, the aggregation rate appears to vary only for the variants in which the propensity of the region corresponding to helix-1, spanning residues 22–32, is changed. Mutations that stabilize the first helix slow down the aggregation process while those that destabilize it increase the aggregation rate. AcP variants with the first helix destabilized aggregate with rates increased to different extents depending on whether the introduced mutations also alter the propensity to form β-sheet structure. The fact that the first α-helix is important for aggregation and the second helix is important for folding indicates that these processes are highly specific. This partitioning does not reflect the difference in intrinsic α-helical propensities of the two helices, because helix-1 is the one presenting the highest propensity. Both processes of folding and aggregation do not therefore initiate from regions that have simply secondary structure propensities favorable for such processes. The identification of the regions involved in aggregation and the understanding of the factors that promote such a process are of fundamental importance to elucidate the principles by which proteins have evolved and for successful protein design. The native state of human muscle acylphosphatase (AcP) presents two α-helices. In this study we have investigated folding and aggregation of a number of protein variants having mutations aimed at changing the propensity of these helical regions. Equilibrium and kinetic measurements of folding indicate that only helix-2, spanning residues 55–67, is largely stabilized in the transition state for folding therefore playing a relevant role in this process. On the contrary, the aggregation rate appears to vary only for the variants in which the propensity of the region corresponding to helix-1, spanning residues 22–32, is changed. Mutations that stabilize the first helix slow down the aggregation process while those that destabilize it increase the aggregation rate. AcP variants with the first helix destabilized aggregate with rates increased to different extents depending on whether the introduced mutations also alter the propensity to form β-sheet structure. The fact that the first α-helix is important for aggregation and the second helix is important for folding indicates that these processes are highly specific. This partitioning does not reflect the difference in intrinsic α-helical propensities of the two helices, because helix-1 is the one presenting the highest propensity. Both processes of folding and aggregation do not therefore initiate from regions that have simply secondary structure propensities favorable for such processes. The identification of the regions involved in aggregation and the understanding of the factors that promote such a process are of fundamental importance to elucidate the principles by which proteins have evolved and for successful protein design. acylphosphatase 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol thioflavin T Y25L/D28E AcP variant E27N/D28N/R31N AcP variant E27T/D28T/R31T AcP variant N59A/S60K/S63E/S66A AcP variant The role played by secondary structure in protein folding has been recently actively discussed (1Goldenberg D.P.

The rational design of mutations increasing the α-helical propensity of regions that are in α-helical conformation in the native state has been one of the most popular experimental strategies adopted to stabilize the native fold of several proteins (4Muñoz V.

Biol. 2000; 300: 633-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Such conformational stabilization can be largely determined by an increase of folding rate, when the mutated helix is formed to a considerable extent in the folding transition state (5Viguera A.R. Villegas V. Aviles F.X. Serrano L. Folding Des. 1997; 2: 23-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Zitzewitz J.A. Ibarra-Molero B. Fishel D.R. Terry K.L. Matthews C.R.

Biol. 2000; 300: 633-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Formation of local secondary structure to an extent similar to that existing in the transition state has been estimated to contribute to a significant, although small, fraction of the activation free energy required for folding (7Taddei N. Chiti F. Fiaschi T. Bucciantini M. Capanni C. Stefani M. Serrano L. Dobson C.M. Ramponi G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 633-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recent experiments on SH3 domains from drkN and spectrin have shown that these β-sheet proteins can be strongly stabilized by single mutations that enhance the propensity of a region of the polypeptide chain to form the native β-turn structure (8Martinez J.C. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1010-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 9Mok Y.-K. Elisseeva E.L. Davidson A.R. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 913-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Protein aggregation is the process from which amyloid formation develops. A number of severe human pathologies are based on extracellular deposition of insoluble protein aggregates known as amyloid fibrils (10Bellotti V. Mangione P. Stoppini M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 977-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 11Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). These show a common ultrastructural architecture independent of the protein involved in their formation and feature intermolecular β-sheet structure (12Sunde M. Blake C.C.F. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 123-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aggregation process is today considered as a process acting in competition with the normal folding pathway. This concept has derived from the facts that protein aggregation is a common property of any polypeptide chain and that the process takes place from at least partially unfolded states (11Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 13Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 9: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). The native protein and the amyloid aggregates can therefore be seen as originating from a common population of partially unfolded, interconverting molecules. In other words, protein aggregation and protein folding are the two sides of the same coin, and it could be argued that structural factors playing relevant roles in one process are also involved in the other one. Human muscle acylphosphatase (AcP)1 is an α/β 98-residue protein that has been shown, depending on experimental conditions, to fold following a two-state mechanism (14van Nuland N.A.J. Chiti F. Taddei N. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) or to aggregate to produce amyloid fibrils structurally similar to those associated with disease (15Chiti F. Webster P. Taddei N. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3590-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Two-state folding of AcP occurs through a transition state structure containing a primitive, not completely stabilized, hydrophobic core and significantly formed elements of secondary structure (16Chiti F. Taddei N. van Nuland N.A.J. Magherini F. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Chiti F. Taddei N. White P.M. Bucciantini M.

Nature. 2001; 409: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). A study on the common-type AcP isoenzyme has shown that the second α-helix of the protein is completely formed in the transition state whereas the first is only partially structured (7Taddei N. Chiti F. Fiaschi T. Bucciantini M. Capanni C. Stefani M. Serrano L. Dobson C.M. Ramponi G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 633-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). By means of an experimental approach conceptually similar to the φ value analysis introduced by Alan Fersht (19Fersht A.R. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York, NY1999: 558-563Google Scholar) for the structural characterization of the transition state of folding at a residue level, the aggregation rate has been investigated for a number of AcP mutants 2F. Chiti, N. Taddei, C. Capanni, N. Stefani, G. Rampoin, and C. M. Dobson, manuscript in preparation.. The main results of this study are that AcP aggregation is a highly ordered process taking place from specific regions of the protein and that these regions are highly distinct from those involved in protein folding (17Chiti F. Taddei N. White P.M. Bucciantini M. Magherini F. Stefani M. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar)2. AcP has therefore proven to be a particularly suitable model system to investigate folding and aggregation in parallel. In this report we investigate the role of regions corresponding to the two α-helices of AcP and of their propensity to form α-helical structure in folding and aggregation. This provides an opportunity not just to explore the fundamentals of the two processes of folding and aggregation but also to evaluate whether the two processes can be rationally decoupled by specific mutations, an aspect that has relevance for establishing the principles of successful protein design. All the mutants were produced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The presence of the desired mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. All proteins used in this study have cysteine at position 21 replaced by a serine residue, to eliminate complexities in folding reaction associated with the presence of a free cysteine residue (14van Nuland N.A.J. Chiti F. Taddei N. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For simplicity the protein displaying the sole C21S mutation is referred to as wild-type AcP throughout the manuscript. Cloning, expression, and purification of wild-type and mutated AcP were performed as described by Taddei et al. (20Taddei N. Stefani M. Magherini F. Chiti F. Modesti A. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7077-7083Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzymatic activity of the AcP mutants was measured by a continuous spectrophotometric method, using benzoylphosphate as a substrate (21Ramponi G. Treves C. Guerritore A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 115: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by UV absorption using a ε280 value of 1.49 ml mg−1cm−1. The equilibrium denaturation of wild-type AcP and of its variants was studied by measuring the intrinsic fluorescence of 25–28 equilibrated samples containing various concentrations of urea, ranging from 0 to 8.1 m, in 50 mm acetate buffer pH 5.5, at 28 °C. Protein concentration in each sample was 0.02 mg/ml. A Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorophotometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 335 nm, respectively, was used. Each curve, representing the change of fluorescence as a function of urea concentration, was analyzed according to the method of Santoro and Bolen (22Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar) to yield the free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturants ( ΔGH2O), the dependence of ΔG on denaturant concentration (mvalue) and the urea concentration at which half of the protein molecules are denatured (Cm). Unfolding and refolding reactions were followed using a Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorophotometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 335 nm, respectively. All the experiments were performed at 28 °C in 50 mmacetate buffer, pH 5.5, at a final protein concentration of 0.02 mg/ml. The refolding experiments were carried out by a 20-fold dilution of AcP samples denatured in 6 m urea, into solutions containing various concentrations of urea, ranging from 0 to 4.5 m. The unfolding experiments were performed similarly by a 20-fold dilution of urea-free AcP samples into solutions containing urea at concentrations ranging from 3.5 to 8.5 m. The fluorescence traces were fitted to exponential functions to determine the folding and unfolding rate constants kf andku, respectively. Plots of lnkf and lnku against urea concentration were fitted to the equation reported by Jackson and Fersht (23Jackson S.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10428-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar) to obtain the natural logarithm of the folding and unfolding rates in water (ln kfH2Oand ln kuH2O) and their dependences on denaturant concentration (mf and mu). Them, ΔGH2O, andCm values were calculated from these kinetic data according to the method of Jackson and Fersht (23Jackson S.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10428-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). The φ values were calculated as described by Chiti et al. (17Chiti F. Taddei N. White P.M. Bucciantini M. Magherini F. Stefani M. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Aggregation of AcP and its variants was initiated by incubating the protein at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in 25% (v/v) TFE, 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 25 °C. The kinetics of aggregates formation was monitored by mixing aliquots of 60 μl of the incubating solution with 440 μl of 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 25 μmThT, at regular time intervals. Fluorescence measurements were carried out using a Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorophotometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 440 and 485 nm, respectively. The spectrofluorophotometer was thermostatted at 25 °C. Plots of ThT fluorescence against time were fitted to single exponential functions to determine the rate constants of aggregation. Two α-helices are present in the native state of muscle AcP (Fig. 1), encompassing residues 22–32 (helix-1) and 55–67 (helix-2). Fig.2 reports the α-helical propensity of the AcP sequence as determined by the AGADIR1 s-2 algorithm (24Lacroix E. Viguera A.R. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 173-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The polypeptide sequence corresponding to helix-1 shows a remarkable α-helical propensity whereas that corresponding to helix-2 has virtually no inclination to form α-helical structure. Mutations aimed at changing the α-helical propensity of these two regions were designed using the AGADIR1 s-2 algorithm. Particular attention was paid to minimize the perturbation of the hydrophobic packing of the native state. For this reason only those residues completely exposed to the solvent and not involved in hydrophobic contacts were replaced.Figure 2Plot of α-helical propensity (%) versus AcP sequence. Wild-type AcP (continuous line), helix-1 (α+) (dashed line), helix-1 (α−/β−) (dashed-dotted line), helix-2 (α+) (dotted line). The calculation has been run using the software AGADIR1 s-2 (24Lacroix E. Viguera A.R. Serrano L. J. Mol.

The effects of these substitutions on α-helical propensity are reported in Fig. 2. The stabilizing mutations of the helix-1 (α+) and helix-2 (α+) variants were selected to optimize electrostatic interactions and to increase the helical propensity of the inherent residues. Mutations involving a reduction of α-helical propensity of the region corresponding to helix-1 were chosen with an additional criterion, i.e. their effect on the propensity to form β-sheet structure. To this purpose, the scale of Street and Mayo (25Street A.G. Mayo S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9074-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was used to evaluate whether the amino acid substitutions led to an increase or decrease of β-sheet propensity. Protein variants were generated in which, together with a destabilization of α-helical structure, the β-sheet propensity was minimized (helix-1, α−/β− mutant) and enhanced (helix-1, α−/β+ mutant), respectively. The conformational stability of all AcP variants has been determined by means of equilibrium urea unfolding experiments at pH 5.5, 28 °C. Intrinsic fluorescence of pre-equilibrated samples has been measured in the presence of different urea concentrations, and the corresponding unfolding curves are reported in Fig.3. Urea denaturation was found to be completely reversible under the experimental conditions used here. Table I summarizes the relevant thermodynamic parameters evaluated with the fitting procedure developed by Santoro and Bolen (22Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). The helix-2 (α+) variant results to be more resistant to urea denaturation and shows a significantly higher conformational stability, as indicated by the Cmand ΔGU­FH2Ovalues, respectively. The helix-1 (α+) variant possesses, within the experimental error, the same conformational stability of the wild-type protein. The introduction of mutations that decrease the helical propensity of the polypeptide chain (helix-1 (α−/β+) and helix-1 (α−/β−) variants) leads to moderate destabilization of AcP independently of the amino acid residue used for the replacement. The dependence of the free energy of unfolding on denaturant concentration,i.e. the m value, is very similar, within the experimental error, for all the species under investigation.Table IEquilibrium urea-induced unfolding parameters and enzymatic activity of AcP variantsAcP variantCmmΔGU­FH2OEnzyme activitymkJ mol−1 m−1kJ mol−1IU mg−1Wild-type3.934.7618.693800Helix-1 (α+)4.015.1620.681100Helix-1 (α−/β−)3.115.2816.433400Helix-1 (α−/β+)3.364.9016.483800Helix-2 (α+)4.664.9423.032900All experiments were performed at 28 °C, in 50 mmacetate buffer, pH 5.5 Cm is the urea concentration required to unfold 50% of the protein molecules.

The average error for eachm and ΔGU­FH2O value is approximately 7%, for Cm is 0.15 m and for the enzymatic activity is 10%. All protein variants display a significant enzymatic activity (TableI). It has been previously suggested that enzymatic activity can be used as a probe for the assessment of the native-like structure of an AcP protein variant, provided that the mutated residue does not participate to the catalytic mechanism and/or does not contribute to the formation of the active site (26Paoli P. Taddei N. Fiaschi T. Veggi D. Camici G. Manao G. Raugei G. Chiti F. Ramponi G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The activity measurements performed here clearly show that all these AcP variants maintain a native-like structural architecture. AcP active site is formed by residues belonging to the long 15–21 loop and a primary role in substrate binding is played by Arg-23, a residue positioned in the N-terminal region of helix-1 (27Taddei N. Stefani M. Vecchi M. Modesti A. Raugei G. Bucciantini M. Magherini F. Ramponi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Taddei N. Chiti F. Magherini F. Stefani M. Thunnissen M.M.G.M. Nordlund P. Ramponi G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7217-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It can therefore be assumed that, during catalysis, this region undergoes those minor structural modifications required for an optimal catalytic efficiency. This necessarily implies a degree of flexibility of the active site region. The AcP variant carrying mutations that stabilize the helix-1 is the only one showing a significantly decreased enzymatic activity (TableI). The stabilization of the helix would increase the stiffness of the active site region giving rise to a non-optimized catalytic cycle, as it has been found to occur in the thermophilic counterparts of mesophilic enzymes. An alternative explanation for this fact is that the replacement of the residues Tyr-25 and Asp-28 in the helix-1 (α+) mutant determines a minor change of the geometry of the active site resulting in a decreased catalytic efficiency. The rates of folding and unfolding were measured to understand the origin of the change of conformational stability. Stabilization or destabilization of a protein variant can arise from specific effects on either folding or unfolding rates or from a combination of effects on both rates. Refolding rates were measured following the intrinsic fluorescence changes upon dilution of urea-denatured AcP samples at different final urea concentrations. Unfolding kinetics were followed after placing fully native protein at different final denaturant concentrations. All kinetic traces were satisfactorily fitted to single-exponential functions. The natural logarithms of folding and unfolding rates as a function of denaturant concentration are reported in Fig. 4. Analysis of the data shown in the figure enabled us to evaluate the kinetic constants in water,kfH2O and kuH2O, and the dependence of lnk on urea concentration,mf and mu values. The absence of a down-curvature for refolding data points at low denaturant concentration, known as “roll-over,” rules out that any of the protein variants used here fold with significant accumulation of intermediate species. Table II summarizes the relevant kinetic and thermodynamic parameters obtained from these measurements. The helix-2 (α+) AcP variant shows a remarkable increase (over 5-fold) of the refolding rate accompanied by a negligible effect on the unfolding rate. It is, therefore, straightforward to attribute the increased conformational stability of this variant to a specific increase of the rate of the folding reaction. The kinetic data permit the estimation of a φ value close to 1.0 for this AcP variant confirming the importance of the second α-helix in the folding process.Table IIRelevant kinetic and thermodynamic parametersAcP variantkfH2OkuH2OmfmumCmΔGU­FH2Os−12-aParameters obtained by fitting of the data reported in Fig. 4.m−12-aParameters obtained by fitting of the data reported in Fig. 4.kJ mol−1m−12-bParameters obtained according to Jackson and Fersht (23).m2-bParameters obtained according to Jackson and Fersht (23).kJ/mol2-bParameters obtained according to Jackson and Fersht (23).Wild-type0.250.96 × 10−41.690.485.433.6219.68Helix-1 (α+)0.491.66 × 10−41.510.595.263.8019.99Helix-1 (α−/β−)0.0760.59 × 10−41.870.736.502.7617.93Helix-1 (α−/β+)0.0770.36 × 10−41.840.746.462.9719.19Helix-2 (α+)1.341.25 × 10−41.700.425.314.3723.22All the experiments were performed in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, at 28 °C.

Experimental errors, given by the fitting procedure, are as follows:kfH2O andkuH2O, 10%;mf and mu, 5%;Cm, 0.3 m; m and ΔGU­FH2O, 5%. The helix-1 (α+) variant shows an increase, to comparable extents, of both folding and unfolding rates. This results in a basically unchanged conformational stability (Table II). Both helix-1 destabilized variants display a decrease of both folding and unfolding rates in water. From the kinetic constant values it is possible to determine the free energy change of the unfolding reaction that, for both mutants, was found not to be significantly different from that found for the wild-type protein (Table II). The conformational stability values calculated kinetically are in partial disagreement with the thermodynamic parameters obtained from equilibrium experiments (cf. Tables I and II) which indicate, at least in part, a destabilization of the two AcP variants. The discrepancy can be attributed to the different m values obtained from equilibrium and kinetic experiments for these variants. Indeed, the dependence of the unfolding rate on urea concentration,mu, is significantly higher for the helix-1-destabilized variants as compared with the wild-type protein. A direct consequence of this fact is that the kuH2Ovalues obtained by linear extrapolation are lower than the corresponding value of the wild-type protein, whereas, in the range of denaturing urea concentrations, the unfolding rates are always higher. The discrepancy between m values calculated from equilibrium and kinetic experiments has already been found for common-type AcP folding, and it cannot be simply attributed to uncertainties of measurements (29Taddei N. Chiti F. Paoli P. Fiaschi T. Bucciantini M. Stefani M. Dobson C.M. Ramponi G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2135-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for this observation is the presence of native-like intermediates containing non-nativecis X-Pro peptide bonds significantly populated at equilibrium (30Chiti F. Taddei N. Giannoni E. van Nuland N.A.J. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20151-20158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The effects of the helix-1 mutations on the folding and unfolding rates are, in all cases, of similar nature. The helix-1 (α+) variant has both folding and unfolding rates increased; the two helix-1 (α−) variants have both the folding and unfolding rates decreased. These observations lead to estimates of φ values lower than 0 or higher than 1, which are attributable to the presence of non-native structure in the folding transition state. The change of themu value upon helix-1 mutation further complicates the attainment of reliable estimates of the φ value. Wild-type AcP undergoes aggregation in the presence of 25% (v/v) trifluoroethanol (TFE) at pH 5.5 (15Chiti F. Webster P. Taddei N. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3590-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). At the protein concentrations used here, TFE denatures the protein very rapidly, and aggregation develops from an ensemble of disordered conformations on a minute-hour time scale. Such protein aggregates convert subsequently to mature amyloid fibrils after a few weeks. It is possible to get a reproducible measure of the rate of formation of early aggregates by a simple optical test based on the binding of a fluorescent dye, thioflavin T, specific for amyloid2. Because the conformational stability of a protein is often of critical importance for the aggregation process (31Hurle M.R. Helms L.R. Li L. Chan W. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5446-5450Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 32Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C.F.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the experimental conditions used here cancel out the contribution of this factor and the measurement of the aggregation rate becomes a significant parameter accounting for the intrinsic propensity of AcP variants to aggregate. Fig. 5 reports the kinetic traces of the aggregation process for all AcP variants. The fluorescence traces are satisfactorily fitted to single-exponential functions, and the aggregation rates derived from curve fitting are reported in TableIII. Although the helix-2 (α+) variant shows an aggregation rate comparable to that of the wild-type protein, all variants carrying substitutions on helix-1 were found to aggregate with rates significantly different. Stabilization and destabilization of helix-1 causes the aggregation process to be decelerated and accelerated, respectively. In particular, the accelerating effect is much more marked for the variant carrying mutations that, in addition to decreasing the helical propensity, increase the propensity to form the β-structure. A 4-fold acceleration of aggregation is observed for the helix-1 (α−/β+) variant (Table III).Table IIIAggregation rates of AcP variantsAcP variantkaggrk′aggr/kaggr3-bAggregation experiments were performed at 25 °C, in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, in the presence of 25% TFE (v/v).

Open table in a new tab Among the protein variants studied here, the only one showing a notable conformational stabilization, as demonstrated from equilibrium and kinetic folding experiments, is helix-2 (α+). All mutations within the helix-1 region of AcP lead to ΔG of global unfolding only marginally different from that of the wild-type protein, although the stability changes are those predicted on the basis of their effect on α-helical propensity. The φ value analysis of the kinetic data is a powerful method to assess the degree of consolidation of native-like contacts in the transition state for folding of those proteins whose refolding processes follow a two-state model (19Fersht A.R. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York, NY1999: 558-563Google Scholar). The φ value of nearly 1 for the helix-2 (α+) variant indicates that, in the transition state, helix-2 of AcP is consolidated to an extent similar to that in the native state. This finding is in agreement with previous results obtained for the highly homologous common-type AcP (7Taddei N. Chiti F. Fiaschi T. Bucciantini M. Capanni C. Stefani M. Serrano L. Dobson C.M. Ramponi G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 633-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For the reasons explained under “Results,” the degree of formation of helix-1 in the transition state is difficult to evaluate. Some single point mutations of residues within helix-1 of AcP also led to φ values out of the 0–1 range, indicating the presence of non-native structure (17Chiti F. Taddei N. White P.M. Bucciantini M. Magherini F. Stefani M. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Interestingly, molecular dynamics simulations provided a transition state structure with a non-native β-turn in the central portions of helix-1 3E. Paci, personal communication., an observation particularly intriguing when considering that such structural determination was not biased by the present experimental findings. The ability of helix-1 mutations to affect the unfolding rate indicates, however, that helix-1 is not fully formed in the transition state. Previous results obtained on the highly homologous common-type AcP indicate that helix-1 is 30–40% stabilized, compared with the native protein (7Taddei N. Chiti F. Fiaschi T. Bucciantini M. Capanni C. Stefani M. Serrano L. Dobson C.M. Ramponi G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 633-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Hence, the two helices of AcP play different roles in the folding process, helix-2 being more important to develop the folding transition state. Interestingly, both helix-1 and helix-2 have different α-helical propensities in the two isoforms. Helix-1 is more stable than helix-2 in muscle AcP. Nevertheless, when common-type AcP is considered, helix-2 is then the most stable one. Despite such differences, the extent of formation of each of the two helices in the transition state is comparable in the two isoenzymes, reinforcing the theory that overall topology, as opposed to local conformational preferences, determine a key role in the folding mechanism of proteins displaying the topology of AcP (17Chiti F. Taddei N. White P.M. Bucciantini M. Magherini F. Stefani M. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The effects of various mutations studied here on the rate of folding are very different from those observed on the rate of aggregation (Table III). The replacements on helix-2, although causing the folding rate to be considerably accelerated, do not affect the aggregation rate significantly. A recent and systematic mutational analysis has shown that, in the aggregation process of AcP taking place from a partially denatured ensemble, a region, including helix-1, plays a crucial role whereas helix-2 is not relevant.2 The inability of the mutations stabilizing helix-2 to affect the aggregation rate is consistent with this region being non-critical in the aggregation process. By contrast, the change of aggregation rate upon mutation within helix-1 is consistent with the crucial role played by such a region in aggregation. Such changes are, however, opposite to those observed on folding rate. From the values reported in Table III, it is clear that destabilization of helix-1 decelerates folding and accelerates aggregation and that the opposite effects are caused by stabilization of the helix. The two sets of mutations destabilizing helix-1 produce similar effects on folding and favor aggregation to different extents as a result of the different contribution of these mutations on β-sheet propensity. When environmental conditions, such as those used in our experiments to promote aggregation, disfavor thermodynamically normal folding, the secondary structure-forming propensities of the polypeptide chain become critical factors in determining the aggregation efficiency. Both α and β propensity appear to be relevant. Only α-helical propensity appears, on the other hand, critical for folding, most likely because the mutated region is committed to this type of secondary structure in the native state. The results obtained using AcP as a model system are in very good agreement with a recent study, in which the relationships between theoretical secondary structure predictions and the actual structure of the native state have been investigated for a number of amyloid-forming proteins (34Kallberg Y. Gustafson M. Persson B. Thyberg J. Johansson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12945-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Some of these pathologic proteins, such as the prion protein, the Alzheimer's amyloid β-peptide, and the lung surfactant protein C, contain discordant helices, i.e. secondary structural elements that are helical in the native structure but, according to the theoretical predictions, display a very poor α-helical propensity and a high inclination to form β-structure. When residues placed within these helices are substituted to increase the helical propensity of the polypeptide chain, the resulting protein variants do not undergo aggregation and fibril formation (34Kallberg Y. Gustafson M. Persson B. Thyberg J. Johansson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12945-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Similar results have also been obtained for the activation domain of human procarboxypeptidase (35Villegas V. Zurdo J. Filimonov V.V. Aviles F.X. Dobson C.M. Serrano L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1700-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Protein variants carrying mutations aimed at increasing the local stability of the helical regions of the native state reduce the aggregation propensity of this protein (35Villegas V. Zurdo J. Filimonov V.V. Aviles F.X. Dobson C.M. Serrano L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1700-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A kinetic partitioning of folding and aggregation exists as the two α-helical regions characterizing the native state of AcP have distinct relevance in the two processes. This partitioning does not reflect the difference in intrinsic α-helical propensities of the two helices, indicating that both processes of folding and aggregation are specific and do not initiate from regions that have simply secondary structure propensities favorable for such processes. Despite this, folding and aggregation are both sensitive to changes of α-helical propensity of the relevant regions. Mutations enhancing the α-helical propensity increase the rate of folding and decrease that of aggregation as long as the mutated helices are at least partially formed in the transition state for folding and involved in the rate-determining steps of aggregation, respectively. In addition to underlying the fundamentals of folding and aggregation, these findings are also relevant for understanding how protein sequences have evolved and for providing simple rules in protein design. An evolutionary pressure must have existed not just to favor folding to specific globular structures but also to render aggregation less competitive than folding. Identification of the regions involved in the aggregation process and design of their sequence with a relatively high α-helical propensity and a low tendency to form β-sheet structure may aid significantly the attainment and maintenance of stable folding."

For this purpose, we studied proteolytic cleavage of CaMKLK by caspases in vitro and in neuronal NG108 cells. In addition, we have investigated the effect of overexpression of wild type and mutant CaMKLK proteins on staurosporine- and serum deprivation-induced apoptosis of NG108 cells. We found that CaMKLK is a substrate for caspase-3 and -8, both in vitro and in NG108 cells during staurosporine- and serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis. Substitution of an aspartic acid residue at position 62 in an asparagine residue within a putative caspase cleavage site completely blocked cleavage of CaMKLK, strongly indicating that59DEND62 is the caspase recognition site. Overexpression of an Asp62 → Asn CaMKLK mutant protected NG108 cells from staurosporine-induced apoptosis to a similar extent as Bcl-xL.

Moreover, microinjection of Asp62 → Asn CaMKLK protected NG108 cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis, while overexpression of a caspase-generated noncatalytic N-terminal CaMKLK fragment exacerbated apoptosis.

A splice variant encoded by the CaMKLK gene, called CaMK-related peptide (CARP), is highly up-regulated in hippocampi of animals displaying kainate-induced seizures (1Vreugdenhil E. de Jong J.

In humans, two genes have been characterized encoding proteins that exhibit a high degree of homology with CaMKLK. KIAA0369 encodes a 740-amino acid-long protein (5Omori Y. Suzuki M. Ozaki K. Harada Y. Nakamura Y. Takahashi E. Fujiwara T. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 43: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) of which the C-terminal 400 amino acids are 99% identical to CaMKLK, suggesting that the KIAA0369 gene is the human analogue of rat CaMKLK. The N-terminal 300 amino acids of KIAA0369 exhibit 70% sequence identity with a protein predicted by the human doublecortin (DC) gene; the noncatalytic N terminus of rat CaMKLK also has 70% sequence identity with the C-terminal amino acids of human DC (3Vreugdenhil E. Datson N. Engels B. de Jong J. van Koningsbruggen S. Schaaf M. de Kloet E.R. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mutations in the DC gene have been associated with the double cortex syndrome, a disease that is characterized by a malformation of the cortex and by mental retardation and epileptic attacks (6Gleeson J.G.

Possible functions of CaMKLK are indicated by several reports describing that modulation of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) signaling pathway is associated with neuronal survival or neuronal apoptosis. For example, Akt/PKB, an anti-apoptotic kinase that inactivates proapoptotic Bax, is activated by CaMK kinase, thus linking the CaMK cascade to pathways mediating neuronal survival (8Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Inhibition of CaMK-II activity with CaMK-specific inhibitors induces apoptosis in NIH 3T3 cells (9Tombes R.M. Grant S. Westin E.H. Krystal G. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1063-1070PubMed Google Scholar) and sensitizes etoposide-resistant cells to apoptotic challenge (10Kawamura K. Grabowski D. Krivacic K. Hidaka H. Ganapathi R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 1903-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In particular, CaMK-IV, a downstream effector molecule of CaMK kinase, has been associated with apoptosis. Thymic T cells from transgenic mice expressing a catalytically inactive form of CaMK-IV show defects in survival and activation (11Anderson K.A. Ribar T.J. Illario M. Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, CaMK-IV is cleaved during apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells challenged with the proapoptotic agent thapsigargin, suggesting that CaMK-IV is a survival signal, which needs to be shut off during cell death (12McGinnis K.M. Whitton M.M. Gnegy M.E. Wang K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19993-20000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A key factor in apoptosis is the activation of caspases, cysteine proteases that cleave a variety of proteins and by doing so disable important cellular processes and break down structural components such as laminin, eventually causing apoptotic cell death (13Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). In adult neurons, caspase family members, in particular caspase-3 (14Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar), are the critical effectors of neuronal death. This has been demonstrated in a variety of in vitro models, such as PC12 cells (15Yamakawa H. Ito Y. Naganawa T. Banno Y. Nakashima S. Yoshimura S. Sawada M. Nishimura Y. Nozawa Y. Sakai N. Neurol. Res. 2000; 22: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), primary cervical ganglia neurons (16Werth J.L. Deshmukh M. Cocabo J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Rothman S.M. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 161: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and primary cerebral granule neurons (17Boutillier A.L. Trinh E. Loeffler J.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2171-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of caspases, although not always accompanied by overt apoptosis, has been shown to be associated with a number of acute and chronic neurodegenerative brain disorders (reviewed in Refs. 18Eldadah B.A. Faden A.I. J. Neurotrauma. 2000; 17: 811-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar and 19Kitamura Y. Shimohama S. Kamoshima W. Ota T. Matsuoka Y. Nomura Y. Smith M.A. Perry G. Whitehouse P.J. Taniguchi T. Brain Res. 1998; 780: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) such as ischemia and Alzheimer's disease. The importance of caspase activation for neuronal cell death is underscored by studies showing that the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor ZVAD.fmk exerts significant neuroprotection in mouse models of transient cerebral ischemia (20Endres M. Namura S. Shimizu-Sasamata M. Waeber C. Zhang L. Gomez-Isla T. Hyman B.T. Moskowitz M.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1998; 18: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 21Hara H. Fink K.

Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Inspection of the primary structure of CaMKLK revealed the presence of the tetrapeptide sequence DEND at positions 59–62 that is a potential caspase cleavage site (13Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). This, in combination with the fact that a CaMKLK splice variant is up-regulated during kainate-induced seizures, a process accompanied by apoptosis (23Pollard H. Charriaut-Marlangue C. Cantagrel S. Represa A. Robain O. Moreau J. Ben-Ari Y. Neuroscience. 1994; 63: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), prompted us to investigate the role of the CaMKLK gene in apoptosis. We found that it is a substrate for caspases and that overexpression of a noncleavable mutant protects NG108 cells from serum-deprived apoptosis, while overexpression of a caspase-generated serine/proline-rich N-terminal CaMKLK fragment exacerbates apoptosis. Together, our data suggest that cleavage of CAMKLK facilitates neuronal apoptosis. Anti-CaMKLK antibodies were produced in rabbits by injection of a 55-amino acid-long synthetic peptide immunogen corresponding to the N-terminal domain of CaMKLK, designated CARP (3Vreugdenhil E. Datson N. Engels B. de Jong J. van Koningsbruggen S. Schaaf M. de Kloet E.R. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of synthetic CARP and cell lysates of transfected and nontransfected COS cells shows that the anti-CARP antibody recognizes both CARP and full-length CaMKLK (data not shown). Anti-CaMK-IV antibody (polyclonal) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; anti-cytochrome C for immunoblotting, clone 7H8.2C12, FITC-conjugated annexin-V, and propidium iodide (PI) were from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA); and anti-FLAG antibody (M2) was from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech, and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). ZVAD.fmk, DEVD.fmk, human recombinant caspase-3, and caspase-8 were obtained from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. All cell culture chemicals were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. NG108-15 cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) without sodium pyruvate (catalog no. 11965), supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, hybridoma (HAT) mix, and 10% fetal calf serum. At t = 0, cells grown to 80% confluence were washed three times with DMEM (37 °C) and exposed to 2 µmthapsigargin (from a 20 mm stock solution in Me2SO), 20–200 nm staurosporine (from a 0.2 mm stock solution in Me2SO), and 2 mm EGTA in DMEM, supplemented with 0.1% serum for the indicated times. When needed, cells were preincubated with inhibitors for 30 min prior to the addition of the above mentioned chemicals. Transient transfection experiments were performed with Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Cells were exposed to staurosporine 24 h after transfection, and the viability was assessed based on morphology by microscopy. Cells were cultured on eight-well Lab-TekR chamberslides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) and treated as described above. At the indicated times, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS and blocked for at least 1 h with blocking buffer: PBS, pH 7.2, 0.1% immunoglobulin-free bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody in blocking buffer, washed three times with PBS, incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody in blocking buffer with or without 0.1 µg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 3 h, rinsed three times with PBS, and analyzed. Images were obtained with a Zeiss inverted fluorescent microscope (Axiovert S100 TV) coupled to a Hamamatsu digital camera (C4742–95) operated by Openlab 2.2.0 software (Becton Dickinson). The percentage of live, dead, and apoptotic cells was determined using FITC-conjugated annexin-V and PI (Pharmingen). Cells were trypsinized, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2) at 1 × 106 cells/ml. Five µl of the annexin solution and 10 µl of 1 mm PI were then added to 100 µl of cell suspension. Cells were incubated in the dark for at least 15 min and analyzed using a FACscan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), equipped with an argon laser, using the Lysis II program. FITC fluorescence was detected in the FL1 detector (emission 500–550 nm; green). PI fluorescence was detected by the FL3 detector (emission >600 nm; red). Apoptotic cells were defined as annexin-V-positive/PI negative cells. Necrotic cells were annexin-V- and PI-positive cells. Viable cells were both PI- and annexin-V-negative. Total protein was extracted by lysing a million cells in 100 µl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, supplemented with CompleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein concentration was determined with a modified Lowry assay (Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit). Equal amounts of protein were separated by electrophoresis on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10–15%) and semidry electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Blots were blocked with blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween (TBS-T), 2.5% milk) and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer, washed three times with blocking buffer, incubated with secondary HPA-conjugated antibodies for 3 h at room temperature, and washed three times. Binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. All CaMKLK cDNA templates were derived from the plasmids described by Vreugdenhil et al. (3Vreugdenhil E. Datson N. Engels B. de Jong J. van Koningsbruggen S. Schaaf M. de Kloet E.R. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and subcloned in the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (InVitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). The C-terminal FLAG-tagged wild type CaMKLK was constructed by PCR-amplifying a 1.3-kilobase pair fragment using the sense oligonucleotide CCAGGATCCACCATGTTAGAACTCATAG and antisense oligonucleotide CCCGAATTCCTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCAAAGGGCGAATTGGGGGAG and PfuI as a proofreading polymerase. After purification on QuiaQuick columns, the fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRI (underlined in oligonucleotides) and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3.1. Similarly, the C-terminal CaMKLK construct was synthesized using CCAGGATCCACCATGGGCCCTGGGGAAGAAGAGTC as a sense oligonucleotide and CCCGAATTCCTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCAAAGGGCGAATTGGGGGAG as antisense oligonucleotide. The N-terminal CaMKLK construct was generated by using CCAGGATCCACCATGTTAGAACTCATAG as a sense oligonucleotide and CGCGAATTCCTAATCGTTCTCATCCATTGAGCTGCA as an antisense primer. Finally, an Asp62 → Asn CaMKLK mutant was synthesized using CAATGGATGAGAACAATGGCCCTGGGGAAG as a sense and CTTCCCCAGGGCCATTGTTCTCATCCATTG as an antisense oligonucleotide in the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Total RNA was isolated from NG108 cells using Trizol, according to the manufacturer's instructions. As a negative control, serum without any NG108 cells was used and processed similarly. Five µg of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the accompanying instructions at 42 °C for 1 h with oligo(dT) as primer. The cDNA was diluted to 200 µl and 5 µl of this was used as a template in a subsequent PCR with AGCTCTCTACTCCACGCTCG as sense primer and GGCCCATCAAGATCTGGTCA as antisense primer at 1 pmol each, 125 mmol of dNTPs, 1 unit of Supertaq (SphearoQ, Leiden, The Netherlands) and 1× Supertaq buffer. PCR conditions were 4 min at 95 °C, followed by 27 cycles at 48 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and 95 °C for 30 s. NG108 cells were transfected in triplicate with Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the protocol of the manufacturer and lysed after 24 h in lysis buffer (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 1.5 mm DTT, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaFl) and protease inhibitors. The cells were scraped from the plate and centrifuged (14,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C); supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was determined using the Pierce method. 0.5 mg of protein was incubated with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C and then precipitated with protein G-Sepharose. The precipitate was washed three times with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, once with 0.5 m LiCl in PBS, and twice in washing buffer (15 mmβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 0.75 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mmNa3VO4). Washed immunoprecipitates were aspirated to 30 µl, and 10 µl of this was added to 10 µl of buffer B (125 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 25 mm MgAc, 125 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 2.5 mm Na3VO4, 3 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1.25 mm ATP), 15 µl of myelin basic protein (1 µg/µl) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 15 µl of loading buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 9% SDS, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% saturated solution of bromphenol blue in water) and heating for 5 min at 100 °C. Subsequently, samples were size-separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gels (20 h, 75 V), which were dried and exposed to x-ray film. The density of bands was determined using NIH Image 1.62 software. Values were corrected for background and for the amount of immunoprecipitated antigen. The latter was determined by Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated material using the polyclonal antibody FLAG probe CD8 in combination with the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were seeded on glass-bottomed coverslip dishes (Matteck Corp., Ashland, OR) 24–48 h prior to injection. Nuclear microinjection was performed using an automated microinjection system (Eppendorf Transjector 5246, micromanipulator 5171). Identical standardized conditions of pressure (150 hectopascals) and time (0.1 s) were used for microinjection in all experiments. CaMKLK plasmid DNA was mixed 1:5 with EGFP-N1 reporter plasmid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) in ultrapure water to a final concentration of 100 ng/µl of CaMKLK plasmid. Cells were injected, and the next morning the number of green viable cells was counted (t = 0). Cells were washed three times with serum-free medium to remove all serum and kept in serum-free medium. Cells were counted again 48 h after serum withdrawal. Viability was expressed as green viable cells at a given time after serum withdrawal as percentage of green cells at t = 0. For each construct, at least 400 green cells were counted from an average of six independent injection experiments. Injection of pcDNA 3.1 plasmid served as control. CaMKLK wasin vitro translated using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT transcription/translation system) in a 50-µl reaction volume with35S-labeled methionine (Redivue; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). Five µl of the in vitro translation reaction were used in a 50-µl caspase degradation assay with 40 units of recombinant caspase. Reactions were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was fixed for 15 min in destain solution, dried at 80 °C for 1 h, and exposed overnight to Kodak Biomax film. Caspase-3 assay conditions were as follows: 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, 5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mmEDTA. Caspase-8 assay conditions were as follows: 100 mmPIPES, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% CHAPS, 50% sucrose, 50 mm DTT (24Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Caspases were preincubated with 50 µm ZVAD.fmk 30 min prior to the addition of the in vitro translated CaMKLK. Subcellular fractionation was performed as described in Ref. 25Juin P. Hueber A.O. Littlewood T. Evan G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1367-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar. Cells grown on 15-cm dishes were scraped using a Teflon scraper, collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g, and washed twice with PBS. Cells were resuspended in sucrose-supplemented cell extract buffer (SCEB; 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 µmcytochalasin B, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), left on ice for 30 min, and then homogenized by 50 strokes in an ice-cold Dounce homogenizer. Intact cells and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 2,000 × g. Mitochondria were collected from the resulting supernatant by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The mitochondrial pellet, resuspended in SCEB and the postmitochondrial fraction, was aliquotted and frozen at −80 °C prior to protein determination and immunoblotting. For immunoblotting, 10 µg of mitochondrial and 20 µg of postmitochondrial fractions were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P. To determine whether the novel kinase CaMKLK is expressed in NG108-15 cells, we performed Western blot analysis and RT-PCR experiments. A synthetic peptide immunogen, corresponding to the serine/proline-rich N terminus of CaMKLK, was used to raise polyclonal antibodies. This region is similar to the serine/proline-rich region of CaMK-IV. In order to rule out the possibility of cross-reactivity, blots were stained with both anti-CaMKLK (Fig. 1A) and anti-CaMK-IV (Fig. 1B). The blot incubated with anti-CaMKLK revealed one major band of 52 kDa, which was smaller than the band recognized by the anti-CaMK-IV antibody (Fig. 1B). In accordance with other studies, the anti-CaMK-IV antibody recognized a 62-kDa band. RT-PCR confirmed CaMKLK expression in NG108-15 cells. Using two CaMKLK-specific primers, a single band was observed of ∼850 base pairs after 27 rounds of amplification, which is in agreement with an expected CaMKLK cDNA fragment of 851 base pairs (Fig.2). We conclude that both CaMKLK transcripts and protein are expressed in NG108 cells, allowing the study of CaMKLK function in these cells as an in vitro model system. To test whether CaMKLK is a substrate for caspases, we incubated radiolabeled CaMKLK with recombinant caspase-8, an early “upstream” caspase, and caspase-3, a presumed effector caspase (13Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). CaMKLK is cleaved by both caspase-8 and -3 (Fig.3, A and B) at the same caspase site, generating a detectable and characteristic 42-kDa cleavage product. The size of the caspase-generated fragment (42 kDa) (lane 2 in Fig. 3A, lane 1 in Fig. 3B) is identical to the size of anin vitro translated construct starting at the59DEND62 and ending at the C terminus of CaMKLK (C-terminal) protein (Fig. 3, C-term). This suggests that the caspases indeed cleave at the predicted59DEND62. The cleavage is inhibited by the pancaspase inhibitor ZVAD.fmk, confirming the caspase specificity of the observed degradation of CaMKLK. Moreover, mutation of the cleavage site from Asp62 into Asn62 completely abrogated the cleavage, strongly indicating that 59DEND62is the site of caspase cleavage in vitro. We wished to assess whether cleavage of CaMKLK occurs in apoptotic NG108-15 cells and what its significance might be for apoptosis. To achieve this, we first examined the nature of cell death in NG108 cells induced by a number of agents, which have been shown to trigger apoptosis in other cell lines. Cell death was induced by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+/Mg2+ ATPase, by EGTA, a calcium chelator, and by staurosporine, a generic inhibitor of protein kinases. NG108-15 cells undergo cell death in response to all agents within 18 h. The observed death was indeed apoptotic, since cells exposed to all agents displayed chromatin condensation and fragmentation typical of apoptosis. An example is shown in Fig.4. Cells also released cytochromec from the mitochondria into the cytosol (Fig.5), another hallmark of apoptosis. Finally, cells exposed phosphatidylserine on the exterior of the cells as determined using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of annexin-V staining of live cells (Fig.6).Figure 5Cytochrome c release induced by several triggers of apoptosis in NG108 cells. NG108 cells were treated with 20–200 nm staurosporine or 2 µm thapsigargin (Th) for 18 h in DMEM, 0.1% serum. Subcellular fractionation and immunoblot of the heavy membrane fraction (mitochondria) and the postmitochondrial fraction (cytosol) were performed as described. All triggers induce a relocation of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Induction of apoptosis in NG108 cells analyzed by annexin-V staining of live cells by flow cytometry.NG108 cells were treated with 20–200 nm staurosporine (Stauro), 2 µm thapsigargin (Th), or 2 mm EGTA in DMEM, 0.1% serum. After 18 h, cells were trypsinized and stained for PS exposure using annexin-V as described. Apoptotic cells were defined as annexin-positive/PI-negative cells. All triggers except serum withdrawal induce apoptosis within 18 h. *, statistically significant relative to control (t test, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we investigated possible CaMKLK cleavage during apoptosis. We transfected FLAG-tagged CaMKLK into NG108-15 cells and subsequently induced apoptosis with staurosporine. FLAG-tagged CaMKLK was cleaved by the endogenous caspases in NG108 cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig.7). The cleavage probably occurs at the putative caspase site described above, since we observed only a single cleavage product whose size (42 kDa) is identical to that of the fragment generated by incubation of CaMKLK with recombinant caspase-3 and -8 (Fig. 3). In order to assess whether the cleavage of CaMKLK by caspases serves some facilitating purpose during apoptosis, we determined the effect of expression of a noncleavable mutant Asp62 → Asn CaMKLK on staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Bcl-xL, a potent protector of cells undergoing apoptosis, which depends on release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (26Kroemer G. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 66: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. As expected, compared with the control (pcDNA 3.1; see Fig.8A), overexpression of Bcl-xL reduces cell death considerably (Fig.8D). All cells transfected with pcDNA 3.1 had detached from the plate within 18 h of staurosporine exposure (Fig.8A), whereas 20–30% of cells transfected with Bcl-xL were still attached after 18 h of exposure to staurosporine. Overexpression of wild type CaMKLK (Fig. 8C) did not observably affect staurosporine-induced cell death;i.e. 100% of cells had detached from the plate. However, overexpression of Asp62 → Asn CaMKLK (Fig. 8B) reduced cell death to the same extent as overexpression of Bcl-xL; 20–30% of the cells remained attached to the dish after 18 h of staurosporine exposure. Thus, Asp62 → Asn CaMKLK protects against apoptosis. This suggested that the actual cleavage of CaMKLK facilitated apoptosis and indicated that CaMKLK is not just a victim of caspases, activated during apoptosis. In order to assess whether one or both of the generated fragments served pos"

To induce disease, both toxins must first bind ganglioside GM1 at the apical surface of polarized intestinal epithelial cells, enter the cell by endocytosis, and traffic retrograde through the Golgi cisternae to the ER, where the toxin's enzymatic subunit unfolds and translocates to the cytosol (1Lencer W.I.

Recent studies indicate that toxin function depends on binding specifically to GM1 and on association with detergent-insoluble membrane microdomains (lipid rafts) (4Wolf A.A. Jobling M.G. Wimer-Mackin S. Madara J.L. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we have proposed that toxin binding to GM1represents a form of protein-lipid modification that provides the sorting motif for association with lipid rafts and retrograde trafficking into the secretory pathway of target epithelial cells (1Lencer W.I. Hirst T.R. Holmes R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar,4Wolf A.A. Jobling M.G. Wimer-Mackin S. Madara J.L. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). CT and LTI consist of five identical B-subunits (≈11 kDa) and a single A-subunit with two domains termed the A1- and A2-peptides. The pentameric B-subunit (≈55 kDa) binds with high affinity to GM1 at the apical cell surface (5Cuatrecasas P. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3558-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 6Holmgren J. Lonnroth I. Mansson J.-E. Svennerholm L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dis. 1973; 127: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and thus tethers the toxin to the membrane of host cells. The A1-peptide (≈22 kDa) is enzymatically active and acts inside the cell to activate adenylyl cyclase by catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of the heterotrimeric GTPase Gαs(8Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2455-2457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Moss J. Stanley S.J. Lin M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11993-11996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cassel D.

In the intestine, activation of adenylyl cyclase induces Cl− secretion, the fundamental transport event responsible for secretory diarrhea. The B-subunits of CT and LTI isolated from all toxigenic V. cholerae and E. coli strains contain a highly conserved exposed peptide loop (Glu51–Ile58) that faces the cell membrane upon B-subunit binding to GM1. The peptides in this loop are not essential for B-subunit assembly or secretion (11Sixma T.K. Pronk S.E. Kalk H.H. Wartna E.S. van Zanten B.A.M. Witholt B. Hol W.G.J.

Biol. 1995; 251: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and the reason for the high degree of evolutionary conservation in this region is not readily apparent. Residues at both “edges” of this loop, however, participate indirectly in binding the oligosaccharide domain of GM1 (14Merritt E.A. Sarfaty S. van der Akker F. L'Hoir C. Martial J.A. Hol W.G.J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). We have recently examined the function of this loop by alanine scanning mutagenesis. Substitution of histidine with alanine at position 57 resulted in a toxin (CT-H57A) that bound purified GM1 with high affinity, nearly equivalent to that of wt CT (15Aman A.T. Fraser S. Merritt E.A. Rodigherio C. Kenny M.J. Ahn M. Hol W.G. Williams N.A. Lencer W.I. Hirst T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8536-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The H57A substitution, however, rendered the B-subunit unable to induce apoptosis when applied to primary isolates of mouse CD8+ T cells and the holotoxin functionally inactive when applied to cultured human intestinal T84 cells (15Aman A.T. Fraser S. Merritt E.A. Rodigherio C. Kenny M.J. Ahn M. Hol W.G. Williams N.A. Lencer W.I. Hirst T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8536-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These data implied that the H57A mutation uncoupled toxin binding to its cell-surface receptor GM1 from downstream signal transduction, possibly by affecting toxin trafficking into the cell. In this study, we sought to understand the defect in the cellular processing that rendered the H57A toxin variant inactive when applied to the polarized human intestinal cell line T84. Our data show that CT-H57A bound to only a fraction of the cell-surface receptors available to wt CT. The bulk of cell-surface receptors inaccessible to CT-H57A localized to detergent-insoluble apical membrane microdomains. Compared with wt CT, CT-H57A exhibited less stable binding to GM1, and the bulk of CT-H57A was rapidly released from intact cells at physiologic temperatures or degraded intracellularly. CT-H57A was not transported into the Golgi and ER, which is necessary for toxicity. These results indicate that CT action on polarized epithelial cells depends on stable high affinity binding to GM1 and emphasize the importance of lipid trafficking in CT action. Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Sigma) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES and with pH adjusted to 7.4 was used for all assays unless otherwise stated. T84 cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection were cultured and passaged as described previously (16Lencer W.I. Delp C. Neutra M.R. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Measurements of short circuit current (Isc) and resistance were performed with 0.33-cm2 monolayers, whereas biochemical studies were performed with 5- or 45-cm2 monolayers as described previously (4Wolf A.A.

After clarification and filtration, this was applied to a HiTrap® affinity column (5 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-charged with 0.1 m NiCl2 and equilibrated with buffer A, and the bound material was eluted using a linear gradient of imidazole (0–0.5 m) in buffer A. Fractions containing the toxin were pooled; desalted by overnight dialysis against 20 mm Tris base and 20 nm NaCl (pH 8.75) at 4 °C; and then applied to a Resource Q ion-exchange column (6 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (20 mm to 0.5 m) in 20 mm of Tris base (pH 8.75). Fractions containing the toxin were added to a NAP-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to replace the buffer with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Toxin concentration was determined by UV absorbance at λ = 280 nm using the theoretical molar extinction coefficient for the holotoxin. Recombinant wt and mutant H57A cholera toxin B-subunits (CTB and CTB-H57A, respectively) were purified by the method reported by Richards et al. (20Richards C.M. Aman A.T. Hirst T.R. Hill T.J. Williams N.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1664-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). T84 cells grown on 96-well plates (Costar Corp., New Bedford, MA) or 96-well plates coated with 2 μg/ml GM1 (Matreya, Inc., Pleasant Gap, PA) were incubated with 3 nm HRP-labeled cholera toxin B-subunit (Sigma) alone or in combination with increasing concentrations of recombinant wild-type or mutant cholera toxin B-subunit as a competitor in HBSS containing 0.5% BSA for 45 min at 4 or 37 °C, respectively. Plates were washed with HBSS and developed at 37 °C using standard conditions for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (4Wolf A.A. Jobling M.G. Wimer-Mackin S. Madara J.L. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. J.

Liposomes containing pure GM1, GD1a (Matreya, Inc.), or the indicated combinations of the two were prepared by dissolving the gangliosides in methanol, followed by evaporation of the solvent using a vacuum pump. Pellets were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) (2 μg/ml final concentration), immediately sonicated, and used for coating 96-well plates. Toxin binding affinity was assessed as described above. Binding isotherms for wild-type CTB and mutant CTB-H57A were determined by incubating at 4 °C increasing amount of toxins in HBSS and 0.5% BSA with T84 cells grown to confluence on 96-well plates. After 45 min, the plates were washed with HBSS, and the presence of specifically bound CTB or CTB-H57A was assayed using rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the cholera toxin B-subunit (1:1000 in HBSS and 0.5% BSA). The antibody recognized both CTB and CTB-H57A equally as assessed by ELISA and Western blotting. Binding curves were analyzed for mass action binding to fit one or two classes of receptor as previously reported (21Lencer W.I. Chu S.H. Walker W.A. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 3126-3130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATP depletion of glucose-starved T84 cell monolayers was achieved using antimycin A (10 μm) and 2-deoxyglucose (10 mm) following the method described by Bacallao et al. (22Bacallao R. Garfinkel A. Monke S. Zampighi G. Mandel L.J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3301-3313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type or mutant cholera toxin B-subunits (20 nm) were applied to apical membranes of confluent monolayers of T84 cells in 45-cm2 inserts at 4 °C. Cells were washed of any unbound toxins and used for isolation of detergent-insoluble membranes (lipid rafts) by sucrose equilibrium density centrifugation as previously described (23Badizadegan K. Dickinson B.L. Wheeler H.E. Blumberg R.S. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G895-G904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Representative fractions of the floating membranes and the soluble fractions were collected as needed. Wild-type or mutant cholera toxin B-subunits (20 nm) were applied at 4 °C for 45 min to confluent T84 cells grown on 96-well plates and washed three times with ice-cooled HBSS and once with warm HBSS (37 °C). Plates were then moved to 37 °C for the indicated times and back to 4 °C prior to immunolabeling. Binding of surface-bound toxin was visualized using rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the cholera toxin B-subunit (1:1000 in HBSS and 0.5% fish gelatin). For studies of cell-associated toxin at 4 °C and after endocytosis, 20 nm CTB or CTB-H57A was applied apically to confluent monolayers of T84 cells in 5-cm2inserts at 4 °C for 45 min. Cells were washed of unbound toxins with ice-cooled HBSS and moved to 37 °C for the indicated times or kept at 4 °C until lysis in 400 μl of 5% SDS in water. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and the DNA was removed by hard vortexing and centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min). Samples were run on 10–20% denaturing Tris·HCl-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting, Western-blotted using rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the cholera toxin B-subunit (1:1000 in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20) and HRP-conjugated goat secondary antibody, and detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, cells were treated with toxins as described above (both apically and basolaterally); scraped; and washed with buffer containing 0.34 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C. Pellets were then extracted at 4 °C with 2 ml of buffer composed of 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1.25%n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, 0.25% SDS, and 0.1% BSA with the addition of a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After solubilization of the cellular and cell-associated proteins, samples were clarified (10,000 ×g for 10 min), and the B-subunit of CT was immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies covalently coupled to polystyrene beads (Polyscience) prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immune complexes formed overnight at 4 °C were recovered by centrifugation (6000 × g for 6 min) and washed three times with water. Immunoprecipitated proteins and co-immunoprecipitated gangliosides were released from the beads by heating in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer at 100 °C for 5 min. For the detection of GM1, samples were run on polyacrylamide gels (any ganglioside will run with the dye front), transferred to nitrocellulose using a transfer buffer without methanol, and blotted with HRP-labeled cholera toxin B-subunit (3 nm in 1% BSA in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20). Wild-type and mutant H57A holotoxins were engineered to contain the sulfation consensus motif SAEDYEYPES at the C terminus of their respective B-subunits. 2Y. Fujinaga and W. I. Lencer, unpublished data. Recombinant toxins were produced and purified as described above. For in vivo sulfation experiments, T84 cells were first washed three times with sulfate-free HBSS, kept at 37 °C for 1.5 h in sulfate-free HBSS, and then incubated with 0.5 mCi/ml Na235SO4 in the same buffer for 30 min. The sulfation toxin variants were added to T84 cells both apically and basolaterally to a final concentration of 20 nm, further incubated for 50 min at 37 °C, and then washed twice with ice-cold HBSS. Following total cell lysis, immunoprecipitation using rabbit anti-CTB antibodies as described previously (17Lencer W.I. Moe S. Rufo P.A. Madara J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was performed. Samples were run on 10–20% denaturing Tris·HCl-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Both wt CT and the H57A variant (CT-H57A) were expressed and purified from V. cholerae O395NT supernatants. Expression and assembly into holotoxin of CT-H57A were equal to those observed with wt CT (data not shown). The purified CT B-subunit containing the H57A substitution exhibited stability in protein folding and high affinity binding to purified GM1 as assessed by surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore; apparent Kd = 46 and 249 pm for wt CTB versus CTB-H57A when tested at 20 nm) (15Aman A.T. Fraser S. Merritt E.A. Rodigherio C. Kenny M.J. Ahn M. Hol W.G. Williams N.A. Lencer W.I. Hirst T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8536-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and modified GM1 ELISA (apparentKd ≈ 1 nm for both toxins). Initial studies showed that the H57A substitution strongly attenuated the toxicity of the holotoxin when applied to human intestinal T84 cell monolayers (Fig. 1). Both apical (Fig.1A) and basolateral (Fig. 1B) cell surfaces were equally resistant to toxin application. Dose-response experiments showed that CT-H57A displayed an almost complete lack of toxicity (Fig.1C). A small secretory response was, however, detected with CT-H57A concentrations >50 nm. This activity was completely inhibited by competition with excess wt CT B-subunit, but not tetanus toxin C fragment, which binds only ganglioside GD1b (Fig. 1D). Moreover, brefeldin A, a fungal metabolite that inhibits vesicular transport in the secretory pathway and vesicular exchange between endosomes and Golgi cisternae/ER in most eukaryotic cells (24Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar, 25Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1991; 67: 449-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), including T84 cells (26Lencer W.I. de Almeida J.B. Moe S. Stow J.L. Ausiello D.A. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2941-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), also inhibited CT-H57A-induced Cl− secretion (Fig.1D). Thus, the small secretory response induced by high concentrations of CT-H57A was specific to toxin binding to GM1 and sensitive to inhibition of retrograde vesicular transport into the ER. These characteristics are consistent with the mechanism of action described for wt CT (1Lencer W.I. Hirst T.R. Holmes R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 27Lencer W.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G781-G786PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the H57A substitution rendered CT completely inactive when applied at toxin concentrations (20 nm) that far exceeded the apparentKd for binding GM1 and were predicted to saturate 100% of available receptors at steady state (Fig. 1,A and B). These initial data implied that the H57A mutation uncoupled the CT·GM1 complex from downstream signal transduction, presumably by affecting toxin trafficking into the cell. Given the discrepancy between the in vitro binding studies and the in vivo toxicity data, we asked if the H57A toxin variant could bind GM1 on T84 cell membranes with wild-type affinity as seen with immobilized GM1 on plates. In initial studies, we compared the ability of wt and H57A variant B-subunits to act as competitive inhibitors of CT action on T84 cells. Fig.2A shows that excess wt CT B-subunit effectively blocked the Cl− secretory response to wt holotoxin (0.5 nm applied apically), but excess B-subunit containing the H57A substitution had no effect (Fig.2B). These results were not predicted based on the high affinity binding of CT-H57A to GM1 as assessed in vitro (15Aman A.T. Fraser S. Merritt E.A. Rodigherio C. Kenny M.J. Ahn M. Hol W.G. Williams N.A. Lencer W.I. Hirst T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8536-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Rather, they indicted that CT-H57A exhibited a lower affinity binding to receptors on T84 cell membranes and failed to compete with wt CT for entry into the cell. To test this idea, toxin binding to confluent monolayers of T84 cells was assessed directly. Steady-state binding isotherms showed that CTB-H57A exhibited high affinity binding to T84 monolayers (apparent Kd equal to that of wt CT as assessed in this assay), but did not recognize all binding sites available to wt toxin (Fig.3A). Even at the highest doses tested (2.5 logs higher than that required for wt toxin to elicit maximal binding and a maximal physiologic response), still ∼30–40% less CTB-H57A was bound to T84 cell membranes. These data were confirmed by Western blotting of total cell-associated toxin (data shown below in Fig. 6) and reproduced at 37 °C on T84 monolayers depleted of ATP to inhibit endocytosis. We also found that unlike wt CT, the binding isotherms for CTB-H57A fit only to a Michaelis-Menten model for two classes of receptors. In contrast, binding of wt CTB to T84 cells fit closely to a mass action model for a single class of receptor sites.Figure 6CTB-H57A fails to enter T84 cells. A, rate of endocytosis for wt CTB (●) and CTB-H57A (○) measured as the disappearance of cell surface-bound toxin. T84 cells preincubated at 4 °C with 20 nm concentrations of the respective toxins were moved to 37 °C for the indicated times, and the specific surface-exposed toxin was measured by modified ELISA.B, total cell-associated CTB before and after endocytosis as assessed by Western blotting of total cell lysates.

C, immunoprecipitation of CTB from total T84 cell extracts before and after endocytosis and co-immunoprecipitation of the CT B-subunit with ganglioside GM1.

D, sulfation of wt CTB and CTB-H57A containing the sulfation motif SAEDYEYPS appended to the C terminus of the B-subunit after 50 min of incubation with T84 cells at 37 °C. The lower panel shows that equal amounts of cell-associated toxin were loaded in each lane after immunoprecipitation from total T84 cell extracts. Immunoprecipitation of CTB-H57A was performed on a 3-fold greater mass of T84 cell lysates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Apparent binding affinities for cell-surface receptors were also assessed for CTB and CTB-H57A by competition against wt CTB labeled with HRP. These studies indicated that CTB-H57A exhibited a notable change in binding affinity for native membrane receptors. Fig.3B shows the binding isotherm for HRP-labeled CT B-subunit (3 nm) incubated with increasing doses of recombinant wt or H57A variant B-subunits as competitive ligands. Compared with wt CTB, CTB-H57A exhibited 30-fold lower affinity for binding T84 cell membranes. At the highest dose tested (10 μm), CTB-H57A displaced less than the full complement (∼60%) of wt toxin from the cell surface. When assessed for binding to purified GM1 immobilized on plastic, the apparent ID50 for CTB-H57A competition against HRP-labeled CTB was shifted 3–6-fold to the right (Fig.4A), comparable to that found for toxin binding to GM1 as assessed by surface plasmon resonance. These data implied that the H57A substitution affected the lectin activity of the B-subunit. In support of this idea, we found that, in contrast to wt CT, CTB-H57A failed to bind the closely related ganglioside GD1a (Fig. 4B). GD1adoes not function as a receptor for CT in T84 cells (4Wolf A.A. Jobling M.G. Wimer-Mackin S. Madara J.L. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), but can be used in vitro as an alternative lower affinity receptor for CT that differs structurally from GM1 by the addition of an extra sialic acid after the terminal galactose in the oligosaccharide head group. Thus, the H57A substitution had a direct but subtle effect on the lectin function of the B-subunit, as CTB-H57A exhibited a small but reproducible decrease in apparent binding affinity for the oligosaccharide domain of GM1 and failed to bind the alternative receptor GD1a. The H57A substitution disproportionately affected toxin binding to receptors localized within lipid rafts (Fig.5, A and B). Compared with wt CTB, CTB-H57A did not fractionate preferentially with detergent-insoluble membrane microdomains (compare first andthird lanes for CTB and second and fourth lanes for CTB-H57A). In these studies, both soluble and raft-associated toxins were recovered in their pentameric form (data not shown), indicating that Triton X-100 extraction had no effect on the stability of the wt or H57A B-pentamer. Taken together, these data provide evidence for functional heterogeneity in receptor sites for CT on T84 cells that was evident only when assessed using B-subunits containing the H57A mutation. Even at the highest toxin concentrations, CT-H57A bound at steady state to only a subset of receptors available to wt CT, and CT-H57A specifically failed to bind those receptors associated with detergent-insoluble membrane microdomains that are thought to be the functional binding sites. Still, at 4 °C, a significant fraction of CTB-H57A bound stably to T84 cell membranes and co-fractionated with apical membrane lipid rafts. At 20 nm CT-H57A, with 40–50% of the available receptors occupied, we would have predicted a functional response. However, this was not observed. To explain why CT-H57A bound to cell-surface receptors, but failed to induce wild-type toxicity, we examined whether the toxin entered the cell. CTB or CTB-H57A was bound to T84 cell monolayers at 4 °C for 45 min, washed free of unbound toxin, and then shifted to 37 °C for the indicated times. Immunoreactive toxin remaining at the cell surface was then detected by modified cell-surface ELISA. Fig.6A shows that after <1 min of incubation at 37 °C, the immunoreactive mass of CTB-H57A located at the cell surface was >3-fold less than that of wt CTB. Fig.6A also shows that both toxins disappeared from the cell surface over time, consistent with the idea that both CTB and CTB-H57A were internalized by endo"

This new concept of a quantitative antibody detection system allows test kits to be set up for fast diagnosis of infectious diseases. To develop a quick and homogeneous assay for the detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, we have explored two acceptor sites of the bacterial Escherichia coli β-galactosidase for the accommodation of HIV antigenic peptides. Two overlapping epitopes (namely P1 and P2) from the gp41 envelope glycoprotein, contained in different sized peptides, were inserted in the vicinity of the enzyme active site to generate a set of hybrid, enzymatically active β-galactosidases. Regulable enzymes of different responsiveness to monoclonal antibody binding were generated with both acceptor sites tested. These biosensors were also sensitive to immune sera from HIV-infected patients.

Yanagawa H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase enzyme (EC 3.2.1.23), encoded by the Escherichia coli lacZ gene, hydrolyzes lactose into glucose and galactose (2Jacob F. Monod J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 318-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (2972) Google Scholar) which are then metabolized for cell growth. In addition, this enzyme also hydrolyzes other substrates producing colored compounds useful to monitor a wide range of biological processes. The three-dimensional structure of β-galactosidase (3Jacobson R.H. Zhang X.J. DuBose R.F. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) permits the permissiveness of solvent-exposed loops to heterologously inserted peptides to be explored. In this context, we previously constructed some recombinant β-galactosidases displaying foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV)1 B-cell epitope peptides accommodated in solvent-exposed surfaces (4Benito A. Feliu J.X. Villaverde A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21251-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Feliu J.X. Villaverde A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The peptide insertion results in hybrid β-galactosidases with reduced enzymatic activity. However, in the presence of anti-peptide monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal sera, these hybrid enzymes translate the antigen-antibody interaction into an easily measurable increase of the enzymatic activity (4Benito A. Feliu J.X. Villaverde A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21251-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Feliu J.X. Villaverde A.

Because the results obtained with these FMDV-based biosensor prototypes were very promising in the context of a fast and easy diagnosis of infectious diseases in a homogeneous assay, we were prompted to design new recombinant β-galactosidases as biosensors for anti-HIV human antibodies. The development of such a homogeneous colorimetric assay could be of great impact in human health and also be helpful in better understanding the mechanism of enzymatic regulation in biosensors by testing whether β-galactosidase enzymatic modulation is restricted to particular epitopes or specific peptide sequence, length, or conformation. Therefore, we have inserted in two acceptor sites ofE. coli β-galactosidase different sized peptides comprising amino acids 589–618 of the env-encoded precursor gp160 of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (9Sanchez-Pescador R.

In addition, we demonstrate that the regulable enzymes specifically respond to anti-HIV-1 antibodies in serum of infected patients, proving the high performance and robustness of these biosensors in complex samples and their usefulness in real diagnostic situations. Both antibody binding and enzymatic modulation data were analyzed in the context of the local conformation of the displayed peptides by three-dimensional modeling of the engineered enzymes, and these are discussed in regard to structure-function relationship. The E. coli K12 strain MC1061 ((F−, λ−), Δ(araA-leu)7697, Δ(cod-lacI)3, araD139,galE15, galK16, hsdR2,mcrA, mcrB, relA1, rpsL150(strR), spoT1) was used for cloning and small-scale protein production. Protein NF795gpC (Fig. 1) was obtained at medium scale in the protease-deficient E. coli BL26 (Novagen), a Lac− derivative of BL21 (hsdS galLon− OmpT−). E. coli FA113 (DHB4gor522 … mini-Tn10Tc trxB::Kmsupp), a derivative of DHB4 (MC1000 ΔphoA(PvuII) phoRΔmalF3 F′(lac+(lacIQ)pro)) with more oxidizing conditions in the cytoplasm was kindly provided by G. Georgiou (19Bessette P.H. Aslund F. Beckwith J. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13703-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and used for the production of S795gp (Fig. 1). The plasmid pJLACZ (20Benito A. Vidal M. Villaverde A. J. Biotechnol. 1993; 29: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and its derivative pJX795 (5Feliu J.X. Villaverde A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) encode engineered β-galactosidases under the control of the cI857-repressed lambda p L andp R strong promoters. The construction of recombinant β-galactosidases displaying HIV B-cell epitopes was achieved by using synthetic DNA fragments that encode the desired amino acid sequences. For cloning at positions 278 and 795 of protein LACZ, ClaI and BamHI restriction sites were added, respectively, at both ends of the synthetic oligonucleotides, resulting in either one ID or two GS extra amino acids. These segments were inserted into a pseudo-wild-typelacZ gene either by using an existing ClaI site for position 278 or an engineered BamHI site for 795 (5Feliu J.X. Villaverde A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid clones were characterized by polymerase chain reaction, restriction analysis, and further DNA sequencing by using an ABI PRISM sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems) in an ABI 373A DNA sequencer. Cell cultures were grown at 28 °C in Luria-Bertani medium plus 50 µg/ml ampicillin (for both E. coli strains MC1061 and FA113) and 30 µg/ml streptomycin (only for E. colistrain MC1061) until they reached anA 550 of 0.4 and were then transferred to a 42 °C water bath where recombinant gene expression was allowed for 3 h. The production of the β-galactosidase recombinant proteins from the pJLACZ-derived plasmids is driven by both λp L and p R promoters and controlled by the thermolabile cI857 repressor encoded on the same vector. Proteins were detected in crude cell extracts by Western blot as described (4Benito A. Feliu J.X. Villaverde A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21251-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Essentially, small amounts of cultures (around 20 µl) were submitted to rapid centrifugation and solubilized cell sediments loaded on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Bands were developed with anti-βgalactosidase rabbit serum (1/500). Anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Sigma and used at 1/2500. For protein purification, cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 10 mmMgCl2 with protease inhibitors benzamidine and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 25 µm and 1 mm, respectively. Cells were disrupted by ultrasonication, and 1.6 m NaCl was then added to the clarified supernatant before loading on an affinity chromatography column for a single-step purification (21Ullmann A. Gene. 1984; 29: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol was finally added to the elution buffer. The medium-scale production of NF795gpC for the standard HIV detection test was done with E. coli BL26 harboring the construction pNF795gpC. Cells were grown in a 5-liter bioreactor on a defined medium with glucose as the carbon source and supplemented with thiamin and ampicillin. The batch culture was started with an initialA 600 of 0.1. Recombinant gene expression was induced by temperature shift from 30 to 42 °C at anA 600 of 4.0, and after 4 h cells were harvested by centrifugation and kept at −70 °C. The composition and the preparation of the medium and the conditions for the batch culture have been described previously (22Seeger A. Schneppe B. McCarthy J.E.G. Deckwer W.D. Rinas U. Enzyme Microb.

The NF795gpC was purified by affinity chromatography as explained above except that no protease inhibitors were added and the process was done always in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using the molar absorption coefficient of E. coli β-galactosidase (ε = 1.5 × 106 ± 1.4 × 105m−1 cm−1). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described previously (23Benito A. Valero F. Lafuente J. Vidal M. Cairo J. Sola C. Villaverde A. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1993; 15: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the purified mutant proteins was calculated from Western blot sheets, using known amounts of pure β-galactosidase (Roche Diagnostics, S.L.) as standard. Taking into account that a fraction of protein could be inactive after purification, the actual concentration of active enzyme was obtained for analytical purposes by comparing the specific activity of purified mutant proteins with that of a cell crude extract, in which the freshly produced enzyme was used as a standard. For determination ofk cat, known amounts of recombinant proteins were incubated with different concentrations of the substrate (ortho-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside) in ELISA microtiter plates. The absorbance at 414 nm was read in a Labsystems iEMS Reader MF. The values of ΔA/min were converted to rate constants and K m andV max values were determined by using the SigmaPlot Scientific Graphing Software. The first-order rate constantk cat (turnover number) for each mutant protein was expressed as V max/active enzyme concentration (s−1). The analysis of the multimeric state of β-galactosidase fusion proteins was carried out in a Biosep SEC S3000 (300 × 7.8 mm) column (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany) using 0.1 msodium phosphate (pH 7), 1 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm dithiothreitol at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Eluted proteins were detected with a diode array detector at a wavelength of 280 nm. For protein size estimation, a gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad #151–1901) was used. Monoclonal antibodies anti-P1 and anti-P2 (kindly provided by Roche Diagnostic GmbH, Penzberg, as research reagents) elicited against the HIV epitopes P1 and P2, respectively, were used in competitive ELISA for the antigenic analysis of the displayed peptides. Streptavidin-coated 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Nunc) were incubated with biotin-BSA-coupled synthetic peptides P1 and P2 (kindly provided by Roche Diagnostic GmbH, Penzberg, as research reagents) for 12 h at a concentration of 50 ng/ml, at 4 °C in 0.1 m carbonate (pH 9.6). ELISA microtiter plates were blocked with 100 µg/ml biotin in PBS for at least 2 h and then washed with PBS. Different amounts of each competing antigen were mixed in 1% BSA-PBS with a pre-defined amount of monoclonal antibody. After 1.5 h of incubation at 37 °C, 95 µl of each mixture were added to the peptide-coated wells and further incubated for one additional hour. After several washing steps with PBS plus 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, bound antibodies were detected with a goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) and developed with 4-chloro-1-naphtol and H2O2. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 µl of 2 m H2SO4, and the absorbance was read at 620 nm. Biotin-BSA-coupled synthetic peptide P2 was also used as unbound, competing antigen. Anti-P1 and anti-P2 antibodies in human sera were detected by indirect ELISA in peptide-coated plates by standard procedures. The modulation assay was performed in low protein binding ELISA microtiter plates (Nunc Polysorp). Two pmol of purified protein were incubated with or without either anti-P1 or anti-P2 monoclonal antibodies at 25 ng/µl or incubated with or without sera from HIV-infected patients or non immune human sera in 80 µl of Z buffer [0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7), 10 mm KCl and 1 mm MgSO4] with 1% (w/v) BSA at 28 °C for 45–60 min. Then, 40 µl of 2 mg/ml ortho-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside or 0.4 mg/ml chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and the reaction was stopped when the corresponding color appeared by adding 50 µl of 1m Na2CO3. The absorbance at 414 or 595 nm was read in a Labsystems iEMS Reader MF. Values were obtained as the relative activity between the mutant protein in contact with the antibody in relation to the activity of the same protein without antibody expressed as a percentage. All experiments were performed in triplicate. For comparison purposes, a blinded assay was performed on a panel of human sera from different sources with both a commercial, automated HIV-1/2 test and the β-galactosidase reactivation analysis described above. The automated test was performed in an AxSYM® immunoassay analyzer from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, IL) according to the standard protocols provided by the supplier. This is a validated routine assay for HIV-1/2 diagnosis approved by the American Food and Drug Administration. A protocol to generate candidate three-dimensional structures for the engineered β-galactosidases displaying antigenic HIV peptides of various lengths inserted at position 795 (see Fig. 1) was developed. A comparative modeling method (Modeler software (24Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar)) and also secondary structure prediction techniques (Fugue program (25Rooman M.J. Kocher J.-P.A. Wodak S.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10226-10238Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)) were utilized to produce the three-dimensional modeled structures of the engineered proteins. The Modeler program builds a three-dimensional structure based on a) the satisfaction of spatial restraints extracted from the alignment of the target protein sequence with those of the template structures and b) the optimization of the energy of the built molecule. The model-building protocol involved the following three consecutive steps. Experimental structures for the amino acid sequences of gpA, gpC, and gpD corresponding to HIV antigenic peptides of increasing length (see Fig. 1 B) are not known. Hence, to model possible conformations of these sequences we used two structural templates. One is the structure of a segment of the HIV gp41 ectodomain (PDB code 1ENV) that, however, does not include all of the amino acids of the sequences to be modeled. We therefore had to use another template, namely the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) gp41 ectodomain structure (PDB code 2EZO). The two additional GS amino acids flanking the HIV peptides were modeled ab initio, i.e. without any spatial restraints derived from the template structures. 40 three-dimensional models were built for each of the three peptides so as to produce enough conformational variety. Because this number is too large to proceed with the construction of engineered protein models, we used the program NMRCLUST (26Kelley L.A. Gardner S.P. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1063-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) to reduce the number of HIV peptide models while keeping as much diversity as possible. This program determines clusters comprising close structures and selects one representative model per cluster. Similarity among the HIV peptide models was evaluated on the basis of the r.m.s.d. value of the backbone atomic positions, defined as the square root of the sum of the square of the distances computed between equivalent atoms divided by the number of atoms. After clustering, the number of representative models was 6, 9, and 8 for gpA, gpC, and gpD peptides, respectively. Starting from the three-dimensional representative models generated for gpA, gpC, and gpD and from the x-ray structure of β-galactosidase (PDB code 1BGL), we built intermediate three-dimensional models in which the amino acid sequences were those of HIV peptides flanked on each side by amino acid stretches corresponding to the β-galactosidase local sequence in the vicinity of position 795. Conformational changes were allowed to potentially propagate locally along the β-galactosidase sequence until the protein chain folded into a well defined secondary structure, as detected in the wild-type β-galactosidase structure. The sequences to be modeled extended therefore to Phe-784 on the N-terminal side and to Ala-805 on the C-terminal side (Fig. 1 A). This step was required so as to account for possible conformational changes mutually induced by the β-galactosidase and the insertions. Secondary structure predictions were performed so as to look for the local propensity of these sequences to adopt a preferred secondary structure. High propensities were taken into account in the construction of the intermediate models. After applying a clustering procedure similar to that used in step (i), we ended up with 8, 7, and 9 representative models for the sequences comprising gpA, gpC, and gpD, respectively. Starting from the known x-ray structure of the AD dimer of β-galactosidase and from the different representative intermediate three-dimensional models, we generated three-dimensional dimeric models of the engineered proteins. The modeling of a dimer was required because the β-galactosidase structure shows a protruding loop (residues 272–288) of one monomer extending toward the active site of the facing monomer. The validity of the generated models was evaluated by assessing their stereochemistry using the Procheck program (27Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and by visual inspection. Respectively, 7, 6, and 10 models of NF795gpA, NF795gpC, and NF795gpD monomers passed the validity tests. The three-dimensional models were examined so as to reveal whether they could interpret the experimental data. For this purpose, the contact area between the active site residues and the rest of the structure was computed. This parameter was calculated as the sum of the areas of the polyhedral faces that atoms of a given residue pair have in common. The polyhedral calculation was performed using a method based on radical planes implemented in the program SurVol (28Alard P. Calculs de Surface et d'Energie dans le Domaine des Macromolecules. PhD thesis. Université Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels1990Google Scholar). The conservation of the epitope conformations in the three-dimensional models was evaluated by computing the r.m.s.d. for backbone atoms using a three-dimensional model of a gp41 peptide as a reference. This model was built using segments of the SIV and HIV gp41 ectodomains as templates because the HIV x-ray structure lacks most of the amino acids of the epitopes. This peptide comprises 45 residues and contains P1 and P2 epitopes. Epitope solvent exposure was computed from atomic coordinates of the three-dimensional models with a probe radius of 1.4 Å using the analytic procedure of SurVol implemented in the BRUGEL package (29Delhaise P. Van Belle D. Bardiaux M. Alard P. Hamers P. Van Cutsem E. Wodak S.J. J. Mol. Graph. 1985; 3: 116-119Google Scholar). The pseudo-wild-type E. coliβ-galactosidase LACZ protein (20Benito A. Vidal M. Villaverde A. J. Biotechnol. 1993; 29: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was engineered to explore its potential to respond to specific anti-HIV antibodies by modulation of its enzymatic activity (Fig.1 A). Two overlapping HIV epitopes of the env-encoded gp41 glycoprotein, namely P1 (16Wang J.J. Steel S. Wisniewolski R. Wang C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6159-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and P2 (17Stigler R.D. Ruker F. Katinger D. Elliott G. Hohne W. Henklein P. Ho J.X. Keeling K. Carter D.C. Nugel E. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Gnann Jr., J.W. Schwimmbeck P.L. Nelson J.A. Truax A.B. Oldstone M.B. J. Infect. Dis. 1987; 156: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), contained in five different sized peptides (Fig.1 B) were inserted either at position 278 or position 795, both located in permissive solvent-exposed loops of the assembled enzyme tetramer. An additional protein, SD7895gp, which harbors HIV peptides at both positions in the β-galactosidase monomer, was also constructed to increase the number of displayed epitopes in the sensor molecules. The sequence of all these proteins at the insertion sites was checked by DNA sequencing of the encoding plasmid vectors after clone screening. The resulting 11 enzymes, carrying insertions that range from 15 to 45 amino acids, were produced in a heat-inducible expression system by thermal up-shift, rendering detectable amounts of β-galactosidase activity in the cell extracts (not shown). With the exception of NF795gpB that was seen only as a low molecular mass fragment in Western blot, all of the enzymes were produced as stable proteins with the expected molecular mass (Fig. 1 C) and were purified efficiently by a single-step affinity chromatography procedure from disrupted cells (not shown). The impact of different sized peptide insertions on β-galactosidase enzymatic parameters was studied in NF795gpA, NF795gpC, and NF795gpD proteins, because their enzymatic activity seemed to be higher than the analogous NF278 series as inferred from activity of cell extracts (data not shown). The enzymatic constants for those proteins are shown in TableI, in which LACZ and JX795A (the last one containing an FMDV antigenic peptide inserted at the same position 795 (5Feliu J.X. Villaverde A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)) were added as controls. Both K m andk cat are strongly affected by peptide insertion in an apparently opposite fashion. Furthermore, increasing peptide size increases the value of K m (although the latter always remains below the K m value of the parental protein LACZ) and progressively impairs the catalytic constant. Also, the resulting specificity constant (k cat/K m) is reduced by peptide insertions with the highest impact observed in NF795gpD, which accommodates the largest foreign peptide. These results suggest that peptide size has a strong but also steady influence on enzyme performance. This seems to be true irrespective of the precise amino acid sequence, because protein JX795A, containing a 27-mer FMDV peptide (Table I), seems to fit in the general profile observed for the HIV sensors. To confirm this presumed influence of peptide length, enzymatic constants were plotted versus peptide size. As seen in Fig. 2,k cat responds linearly to peptide size in the modified enzymes. K m values show a similar trend, although the linearity is not statistically significant. As expected, the resulting specificity constant is also dependent on peptide size but intriguingly, in this case, the nonmodified LACZ enzyme also fits into the correlation. The important impact of peptide insertions on thek cat of the bacterial enzyme was seen as a promising hint concerning the possible responsiveness of these enzymes to antibodies, because the proper performance of enzymatic biosensors depends on k cat modification (37Ferrer-Miralles N. Feliu J.X. Villaverde A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Open table in a new tab The accessibility of the heterologous epitopes to specific anti-epitope antibodies is required for proper sensor responsiveness. This parameter was monitored by a competitive ELISA in which the proteins from the NF795 series were used as competitors for the binding of monoclonal antibodies to their respective antigens. In streptavidin-coated plates incubated with P1-biotin peptide antigen, all proteins competed for the anti-P1 monoclonal antibody, indicating that the epitope is surface-exposed after monomer folding and tetramer formation, although differences in the IC50 values are seen in different proteins (for instance, compare NF795gpC and NF795gpA in Fig.3A). These differences, despite being not clearly dependent on the peptide size, might be due to slightly different structural constraints determined by peptide conformation that could affect either the solvent exposure or the presentation of the B-cell epitope in recombinant P1 peptide. When biotinylated P2 peptide was used as bound antigen in competitive ELISA, none of the protein constructs competed for the binding of the monoclonal antibody anti-P2, whereas synthetic P2 alone indeed did (Fig. 3 B). Noticeably, a model of the anti-HIV 3D6 Fab fragment bound to the P2 epitope predicts the cyclization of this epitope via the two cysteine residues that are critical for antibody-epitope interaction (17Stigler R.D.

TMPIP, the 1,2,3-trimethyl analogue of SCH28080, and variants of TMPIP containing fluorine in the phenylmethoxy ring exhibited IC50 values for porcine H+/K+-ATPase inhibition falling in the sub-10 μm range. Deuterium NMR spectra of a2H-labeled inhibitor titrated into H+/K+-ATPase membranes revealed that 80–100% of inhibitor was bound to the protein, and K+-competition2H NMR experiments confirmed that the inhibitor lay within the active site. The active binding conformation of the pentafluorophenylmethoxy analogue of TMPIP was determined from13C–19F dipolar coupling measurements using the cross-polarization magic angle spinning NMR method, REDOR. It was found that the inhibitor adopts an energetically favorable extended conformation falling between fully planar and partially bowed extremes. These findings allowed a model to be proposed for the binding of this inhibitor to H+/K+-ATPase based on the results of independent site-directed mutagenesis studies. In the model, the partially bowed inhibitor interacts with Phe126 close to the N-terminal membrane spanning helix M1 and residues in the extracellular loop bridging membrane helices M5 and M6 and is flanked by residues in M4.

The P2-type ATPases constitute a family of phosphoenzyme-forming ion pumps that includes the Ca2+-ATPases, Na+/K+-ATPases, and H+/K+-ATPases (1Stokes D.L. Taylor W.R. Green M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All are integral membrane proteins that undergo a series of nucleotide-driven conformational changes to expose binding sites sequentially to ions on each side of the membrane (2Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). A 2.6-Å crystal structure (3Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar) revealed that the Ca2+-ATPase possesses 10 transmembrane helices (M1–M10), a feature that is believed to be common to this family of proteins. The ATP hydrolysis site and aspartyl phosphorylation site are contained within a major cytoplasmic loop between M5 and M6 (6Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H.

The gastric H+/K+-ATPase (gastric proton pump) is concentrated in parietal cells from where it secretes H+into the lumen of gastric glands in electroneutral exchange for extracellular K+ (8Rabon E. Reuben M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The assembly consists of a 1035-residue catalytic α-subunit and a 35-kDa glycosylated β-subunit, which plays a role in membrane insertion, organization, and targeting of the protein (9Jaunin P. Horisberger J.D. Richter K. Good P.J. Rossier B.C. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Catalytic activity of the α-subunit is accompanied by conformational toggling betweenE1 and E1–P,E2—P, and E2 forms of the protein. The E1 forms are responsible for ATP hydrolysis and H+ binding, and theE2 forms are associated with K+binding, dephosphorylation, and release of H+ into the lumen (10Wallmark B. Stewart H.B. Rabon E. Saccomani G. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5313-5319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Modification of the H+/K+-ATPase with the carbodiimide reagent dicyclohexylcarbodiimide revealed that Glu857 at the cytosolic face of M7 is an important carboxyl site for cation binding (11Rabon E.C. Hoggatt M. Smillie K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32137-32146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This finding was supported by the results of mutations of Glu857 to positively charged residues, which gave a 3-fold reduction in the sensitivity of the H+/K+-ATPase to K+ (12Rulli S.J. Horiba M.N. Skripnikova E. Rabon E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15245-15250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Mutations in membrane domains M5 and M6 have also indicated that Glu820 might play a role in K+ binding and conformational transitions (13Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. de Boer M.

Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Many PPIs have been identified, but two have been studied extensively. One is omeprazole, a substituted benzimidazole that reacts covalently with Cys813 in the extracellular M5-loop-M6 region of the H+/K+-ATPase (15Besancon M. Simon A. Sachs G. Shin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22438-22446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The other is SCH28080, a substituted imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine that binds reversibly and noncovalently to the E2 andE2-P forms competitively with respect to K+ (16Keeling D.J. Taylor A.G. Schudt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5545-5551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to accumulation of the phosphoenzyme and inhibition of ion transport (17Mendlein J. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5030-5036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reversible H+/K+-ATPase inhibitors such as SCH28080 have aroused particular interest as potential drugs because their pharmacological activity is modulated by the attendant reduction in gastric acidity after binding to the target protein. The molecular basis for H+/K+-ATPase inhibition by SCH28080 remains unclear. Pre-incubation of the protein with SCH28080 prevents modification of Cys813 by omeprazole (18Hersey S.J. Steiner L. Mendlein J. Rabon E. Sachs G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 956: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which implies that there is some overlap in the binding sites of the two inhibitors. Mutation of Glu820 to Gln in the extracellular M5-loop-M6 sequence produced an enzyme capable of forming a phosphorylated intermediate with low sensitivity toward K+ and SCH28080 (13Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. de Boer M. Fransen J.A.M. de Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29764-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Swarts and co-workers (20Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H.G.M. de Pont J.J.H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 541-547PubMed Google Scholar) argued later, however, that this observation reflected the low tendency of the E820Q mutant to adopt the SCH28080-sensitiveE2 form rather than signifying that Glu820 plays a direct role in inhibitor binding. Experiments with a photoreactive radiolabeled analogue of SCH28080 ([3H]mDAZIP) showed that two peptide sequences in the N-terminal M1-loop-M2 region reacted with the 4-azidophenyl group of the inhibitor (21Munson K.B. Gutierrez C. Balaji V.N. Ramnarayan K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18976-18988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, it has been proposed that SCH28080 and similar inhibitors might interact with the extracellular face of H+/K+-ATPase both in the N- and the C-terminal regions (22Lambrecht N. Munson K. Vagin O. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4041-4048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a mechanism that appears to underlie the inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase by cardiac glycosides (23Palasis M. Kutzweiler T.A. Argüello J.M. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14176-14182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This model for SCH28080 binding could be tested by determining the molecular conformation of the inhibitor or close analogues when bound to the H+/K+-ATPase, thereby placing constraints on the geometry and dimensions of the binding site. Detailed structural information about ATPase inhibitors and other membrane protein ligands has been obtained using high resolution solid-state NMR methods to measure interatomic distances within the molecules at their pharmacological sites of action (24Watts A.

A. 2000; 97: 13602-13607Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) NMR experiments have been performed previously on a complex between H+/K+-ATPase and TMPIP, the non-diazido analogue of mDAZIP (28Middleton D.A. Robins R. Feng X. Levitt M.H. Spiers I.D. Schwalbe C. Watts A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The molecular conformation of TMPIP can be expressed in terms of three torsional angles, φ1, φ2, and φ3, which define the relative orientations of the imidazopyridine and phenylmethoxy rings (Fig. 1). The conformation of TMPIP in the binding site was partially determined by calculating torsional angle φ1 (165 ± 15°) indirectly from a measurement of the internuclear distance between13C labels placed in the N-CH3 and O-CH2 groups of the inhibitor (Fig. 1). In the early stages of investigation, however, it was not possible to determine the complete structure of the bound inhibitor unambiguously. Here, a new strategy has been used to describe the complete active binding conformation of the imidazopyridine class of PPIs. The constraint on torsional angle φ1 determined previously for TMPIP (28Middleton D.A. Robins R. Feng X. Levitt M.H. Spiers I.D. Schwalbe C. Watts A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) has been combined with new structural measurements on a series of novel and biologically active analogues of TMPIP (TM2FPIP, TM4FPIP, TMPFPIP) containing 19F in the phenylmethoxy ring. The values of torsional angles φ2 and φ3were probed by measuring dipolar couplings between the N-CH3 carbon and 19F in the phenyl ring (Fig.1) using the CP-MAS method rotational echo double resonance (REDOR). The structure of the bound inhibitor and information on the binding site gained from site-directed mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling were used to describe models for SCH28080 and its analogues at the site of functional efficacy. Gastric membrane vesicles enriched with H+/K+-ATPase were prepared according to a method modified from that previously described (30Saccomani G. Stewart H.B. Shaw D. Lewin M. Sachs G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 465: 311-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Fresh hog stomachs were obtained and transported on ice in a solution of saturated NaCl. The stomach sac was washed of excess mucous, and any remainder was removed by scraping the fundic region with the blunt edge of a knife and with vigorous rubbing with paper toweling. Membrane enrichment was carried out at 4 °C; 60-g batches of crude fundic slices were minced through a press and suspended in Isolation buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm PIPES, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The suspension was homogenized using 5 strokes of a mechanical homogenizer operating at ∼2000 rpm. The homogenate was separated by ultracentrifugation (Beckman JA-14 rotor, 12,000 rpm, 20 min), and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged to form a pellet (Beckman Ti-45, 40,000 rpm, 45 min). The pellet was resuspended in Isolation buffer and homogenized by 3 strokes of a tight fitting hand-held homogenizer. The suspension was layered over a sucrose/Ficoll density gradient (from the bottom: 15 ml of 30% (w/v) sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 15 ml of 7.5% Ficoll in Isolation buffer) and centrifuged (Beckman SW28 rotor, 24,000 rpm, 90 min). GI microsomal membranes were collected as a band above the Ficoll/Isolation buffer interface. The GI vesicles were maintained by 1:1 dilution in 60% (w/w) sucrose solution (5 mm TRIS-HCl, 5 mm PIPES, pH 7.4) and stored at −20 °C. Protein concentration was determined using a modified Lowry method, and ATPase activity was found according to a method modified from that described elsewhere (31LeBel D. Poirier G.G. Beaudouin A.R. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 85: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Lyophilized membranes (10 μg) were added to 0.5 ml of assay medium (2 mmMgCl2·6 H2O, 2 mm ATP, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 40 mm KCl) and inhibitor. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and quenched by adding 1 ml of ice-cold acid-molybdate (4:1, 5% ammonium molybdate:60% perchloric acid). ATPase activity was estimated as a release of inorganic phosphate from ATP into butyl acetate. K+-stimulated activity was estimated by subtracting basal activity due to Mg2+ stimulation from the activity of the enzyme in the presence of K+ and Mg2+. All of the compounds examined were derived from 2,3-dimethyl-8-hydroxyimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine and 2-methyl-8-hydroxy-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine, which were synthesized by methods described previously (32Kaminski J. Bristol J. Puchalski C. Lovey R. Elliott A. Guzik H. Solomon D. Conn D. Domalski M. Wong S-C. Gold E. Long J. Chiu P. Steingberg M. McPhail A. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 876-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). TM2FPIP, TM4FPIP, and TMPFPIP were prepared in the following manner. 5 mol eq of potassium carbonate in dimethylformamide was added to 1 mol eq of 2,3-dimethyl-8-hydroxyimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine. After 30 min of stirring at room temperature, 1 mol eq of 2-fluorobenzylbromide, 4-fluorobenzylbromide, or pentafluorobenzylbromide was added as appropriate, and the reaction was allowed to stir for 48 h during which a scarlet color developed. The reaction was stopped by dropwise neutralization with 1.0 m HCl until the pH was reduced to below pH 7.0. The mixture was filtered and washed with chloroform. The organic phases were pooled and concentrated to give a crimson oil, which was then separated on a Si60 Keiselgel silica column eluting with chloroform:ethyl acetate (4:1). The quaternary ammonium compounds TMPIP (I), DMPIP (II), TM2FPIP (III), TM4PIP (IV), and TMPFPIP (V) (structures are defined in Table I) were prepared as iodide salts by reaction of the appropriate tertiary amine with 5 mol eq of methyl iodide in 5 ml of acetone. For13C labeled compounds, 13C-methyl iodide was used in place of the natural isotope abundance reagent. The reaction was stirred under reflux until a precipitate had formed. The reaction was removed from the heat and allowed to cool with stirring. The mixture was filtered, washed with ether, and recrystallized from water.Table ISummary of the structure-activity relationship of substituted imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines studied in this workCompoundNameIC50μmITMPIP2.8 ± 3.5IIDMPIP>100IIITM2FPIP5.0 ± 0.9IVTM4FPIP2.7 ± 0.7VTMPFPIP8.2 ± 4.0The IC50 values represent the half-maximal concentrations for inhibition of K+-stimulated ATPase activity in purified gastric membranes (GI fraction). Open table in a new tab The IC50 values represent the half-maximal concentrations for inhibition of K+-stimulated ATPase activity in purified gastric membranes (GI fraction). Substituted imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines were dissolved and diluted in ethanol. The final ethanol concentration upon pipetting an aliquot of inhibitor solution was 2% and was regarded as having no effect on the enzyme preparation. The final concentration range of inhibitor assessed in the assay was 0.1 mm--10 nm. All assays were performed in triplicate on three preparations unless otherwise indicated. The IC50 values were defined as the inhibitor concentration that produced 50% inhibition of K+-stimulated ATPase activity (33Briving C. Andersson B-M. Nordberg P. Wallmark B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 946: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The IC50values were calculated by non-linear least-squares fitting of a sigmoidal function to the experimental data using MicrocalTM OriginTM 5.0. The sample size was based on three assays each measured in triplicate for each compound. Lyophilized H+/K+-ATPase membranes (GI fraction) containing 30 mg of protein were prepared as a pellet by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and incubated with 0–300 μm of labeled inhibitor in 50 μl of incubation medium for 60 min at 37 °C. It was assumed in the first instance that 1 mg of total protein contained 2.5–3.0 nmol of inhibitor binding sites. The pellet was transferred to a 6-mm external diameter zirconia MAS rotor fitted with Kel-F inserts to confine the sample to the center of the rotor. All solid-state NMR experiments were performed on a Varian Infinity spectrometer operating at a magnetic field of 11.7 tesla at temperatures between 5 °C and −50 °C. Wide-line 2H NMR experiments were carried out in a probe head fitted with 7-turn 5-mm coil tuned to 76 MHz, using the quadrupole echo sequence with a pulse length of 3.5 μs. CP-MAS experiments were performed by rotating the sample at a MAS frequency (ν R) of 3–6 kHz. Hartmann-Hahn cross-polarization from 1H to13C was achieved over a 1.6-ms contact time at a field of 65 kHz for both nuclei, and protons were decoupled during signal acquisition at a field of 65 kHz. REDOR experiments (13C observe, 19F dephase) were conducted at a sample spinning frequency ν R of 4500 Hz using a standard pulse sequence with rotor-synchronized π pulses applied at the frequencies of 13C and 19F (34Pan Y. Gullion T. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 90: 330-340Google Scholar). The π pulse length for both the 19F and 13C frequencies was 9 μs. Numerical simulations of multiple-spin REDOR curves were carried out by adaptation of the general algorithms of Goetz and Schaefer (35Goetz J.M. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 127: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The activities of the five imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine analogues TMPIP, DMPIP, TM2FPIP, TM4FPIP, and TMPFPIP were assessed from their concentration-dependent inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by H+/K+-ATPase in a lyophilized gastric membrane (GI) preparation (Table I). TMPIP, with an IC50 of 3 μm, exhibited a marginally higher (although not statistically significant) activity than the activities of the fluorine-containing analogues. The activities of the fluorinated analogues were in the rank order TM2FPIP = TM4FPIP > TMPFPIP, with TMPFPIP having an IC50 of 8.2 μm. By contrast, the analogue DMPIP, which lacks both fluorine and a methyl group at the 3-position of the imidazo ring, was the least active of the compounds studied, exhibiting an IC50 of over 100 μm. Hence, the substitution of fluorine into the phenylmethoxy ring has little or no impact on the activity of the inhibitors, whereas minor changes in substitutions to the imidazo ring appear to have a profound effect on activity. It has been established that an 8-aryl substituent to the imidazopyridine ring system of this class of PPIs is essential for their activity (36Kaminski J.J. Wallmark B. Briving C. Andersson B.-M. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), indicating that the aryl group probably plays a key role in the interaction with the binding site. In the compounds examined here, the aryl group was represented either by a phenylmethoxy or fluorophenylmethoxy moiety. The similar activities of these compounds may provide some clues about their binding and inhibitory mechanisms. Fluorine and hydrogen have comparable atomic radii, and replacement of one atom by the other in an aryl group is not expected to alter the steric properties of a molecule. One consequence of substituting fluorine into aromatic rings, however, is to lower the propensity of the aryl π electrons to interact with neighboring cationic groups; the strength of the interaction is reduced progressively as the number of fluorine substituents in the ring increases (37Ngola S.M. Dougherty D.A. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 4566-4567Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). That the phenylmethoxy and fluorophenylmethoxy compounds have similar activities suggests that the binding mechanism of these inhibitors does not involve an interaction of the phenylmethoxy group with cationic residues in the binding site. It is more probable that the aryl group participates in a π-π stacking interaction with aromatic side groups, because this type of interaction is perturbed much less by fluorine substituents (38Williams J.H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 593-598Crossref Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The close similarity in the activities of TMPIP, TM2FPIP, TM4FPIP, and TMPFPIP indicates that all of these inhibitors share a common binding mechanism, and it is reasonable to assume that the molecular conformation at the binding site is very similar in each case. The torsional angle φ1 of 165 ± 15° determined previously for TMPIP (28Middleton D.A. Robins R. Feng X. Levitt M.H. Spiers I.D. Schwalbe C. Watts A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was therefore considered to be a valid constraint in the structural analysis of the fluorine-containing inhibitors. For reliable determination of the binding conformation of inhibitors it is essential that the inhibitor be observed spectroscopically at its site of action in the H+/K+-ATPase. Wide line 2H NMR was used to investigate the relative proportions of free and bound inhibitor under similar conditions, volumes, and quantities to those used in the REDOR structure analysis (see below). Deuterium was incorporated into the TM2FPIP by forming the quaternary N-CD3 group in place of N-CH3 (Table I), and the deuterated inhibitor was titrated into lyophilized GI membranes in molar equivalence to the phosphorylation sites (∼3 nmol/mg protein). A representative spectrum of [2H3]TM2FPIP in gastric membranes (at −5 °C) is shown in Fig.2 A. The spectrum exhibits two components in superposition, a narrow central line corresponding to highly mobile inhibitor and a broad powder pattern ascribed to the motion-restricted inhibitor. A comparison of the spectrum with simulated spectra (39Zhang H. Bryant R.G. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 363-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) representing different proportions of the two components indicated that the powder component represented over 80% of the total spectral intensity. When [2H3]TM2FPIP was added to a similarly hydrated volume of extracted gastric membrane lipids, only a single line from the mobile inhibitor was observed (Fig. 2 B). This indicates that the broad component arose from interaction of the inhibitor with protein in the GI membrane preparation. After the addition of KCl to the GI membranes containing protein-bound [2H3]TM2FPIP, the broad spectral component disappeared leaving only a single narrow line (Fig. 2 C). K+ competes with imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines for the same high affinity site on the extracellular face of H+/K+-ATPase (16Keeling D.J. Taylor A.G. Schudt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5545-5551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mendlein J. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5030-5036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, these results indicate that over 80% of [2H3]TM2FPIP added to GI membranes was bound to H+/K+-ATPase and could be observed spectroscopically. The active binding conformation of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines was investigated using the CP-MAS NMR method REDOR (34Pan Y. Gullion T. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 90: 330-340Google Scholar, 35Goetz J.M. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 127: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), which provides interatomic distance information from measurements of dipolar interactions between different atomic nuclei (e.g. 13C and 19F). In the REDOR experiment, heteronuclear dipolar couplings, which are usually attenuated or eliminated by magic angle spinning, are reintroduced by applying a train of rotationally synchronous radio frequency pulses at the resonance frequency of one of the nuclear spins (e.g. 19F). The signal from the other nuclear spin (e.g. 13C) is recorded, and the dipolar coupling constant is measured from the observed dipolar dephased signal intensity after applying the recoupling pulses for a duration defined by the number of sample rotations N c and the sample spinning frequency ν R. For a single pair of heteronuclear spins, the internuclear distance is calculated from the quantity S/S0, which represents the fraction of signal lost (dephased) exclusively as a result of the dipolar coupling between the two nuclei of interest. In practice, the accuracy of the distance measurement is improved by measuring S/S0 for a range of dephasing times N c v R (34Pan Y. Gullion T. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 90: 330-340Google Scholar), although it is possible to measure only at single dephasing times in the case of low sample concentrations (40Li Y Poliks B. Cegelski L. Poliks M. Gryczynski Z. Piszczek G. Jagtap P.G. Studelska D.R. Kingston D.G.I. Schaefer J. Bane S. Biochemistry. 2000; 31: 281-291Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The structures of 8-(fluorophenylmethoxy)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines in the H+/K+-ATPase binding site can be probed by REDOR experiments that measure couplings between 19F in the benzyl ring and 13C (the observed nucleus) placed in the N-CH3 group of the quaternary ammonium cation. In the cases of TM2FPIP and TM4FPIP (Table I, compounds IIIand IV) the measured S/S0 values can be converted directly into single 13C–19F internuclear distances (34Pan Y. Gullion T. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 90: 330-340Google Scholar), which are, in turn, functions of the relative orientations of the phenylmethoxy group and the imidazopyridine ring. However, numerical simulations of REDOR dephasing curves showed that measurement of a single distance between13C and 19F at either the 2- or 4-position of the ring cannot provide sufficient information to determine the inhibitor structure unambiguously. The structure could not be resolved from either of these distance measurements even after incorporating the predetermined torsional angle φ1 of 165 ± 15° (28Middleton D.A. Robins R. Feng X. Levitt M.H. Spiers I.D. Schwalbe C. Watts A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) as a constraint. To avoid such ambiguities in the structure analysis, we chose to examine the pentafluorophenylmethoxy compound [13C]TMPFPIP (Table I, compound V) in the binding site. The pres"

We demonstrated previously that the 12/15-lipoxygenase overexpressed in mouse macrophage-like J774A.1 cells was required for the cell-mediated LDL oxidation. However, the mechanism of the oxidation of extracellular LDL by the intracellular 12/15-lipoxygenase has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we found that not only the LDL receptor but also LDL receptor-related protein (LRP), both of which are cell surface native LDL-binding receptors, were down-regulated by the preincubation of the cells with cholesterol or LDL and up-regulated by lipoprotein-deficient serum. Moreover, 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cell-mediated LDL oxidation was decreased by the preincubation of the cells with LDL or cholesterol and increased by the preincubation with lipoprotein-deficient serum. Heparin-binding protein 44, an antagonist of the LDL receptor family, also suppressed the cell-mediated LDL oxidation in a dose-dependent manner. The cell-mediated LDL oxidation was dose-dependently blocked by an anti-LRP antibody but not by an anti-LDL receptor antibody. Furthermore, antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides against LRP reduced the cell-mediated LDL oxidation under the conditions in which the expression of LRP was decreased. The results taken together indicate that LRP was involved essentially for the cell-mediated LDL oxidation by 12/15-lipoxygenase expressed in J774A.1 cells, suggesting an important pathophysiological role of this receptor-enzyme system as the initial trigger of the progression of atherosclerosis.

Because the leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase and 15-lipoxygenase-1 are highly related in their primary structures and enzymological properties and are abundant in various tissues of many species, these enzymes are called collectively 12/15-lipoxygenases (2Funk C.D.

As the mechanism of the cell-mediated oxidation of extracellular LDL, we postulate that binding of native LDL to cell surface receptors is the first step in the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells. Among such receptors, the LDL receptor plays an important role in LDL metabolism in liver and steroidogenic tissues. However, the LDL receptor is not expressed in the intima of normal or atherosclerotic arteries (22Hiltunen T.P. Yla-Herttuala S. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 137: S81-S88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Importantly, the LDL receptor is not required in the cell-mediated LDL oxidation as shown by in vitro experiments (23Cathcart M.K. Li Q. Chisolm G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1857-1865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and LDL receptor-deficient mice studies (20Harats D. Shaish A. George J. Mulkins M. Kurihara H. Levkovitz H. Sigal E.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The native LDL also binds to LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) and scavenger receptor BI (22Hiltunen T.P. Yla-Herttuala S. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 137: S81-S88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The former is also referred to as α2-macroglobulin receptor or CD91 and the latter as high density lipoprotein receptor. It was demonstrated that the both receptors were expressed on the cell surface of macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions (22Hiltunen T.P. Yla-Herttuala S. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 137: S81-S88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Pallesen G. Cell Tissue Res. 1992; 269: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and LRP internalized the ligand into the cell by endocytosis (26Willnow T.E. Sheng Z. Ishibashi S. Herz J. Science. 1994; 264: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It is of importance to identify the receptor involved in the initial step of LDL oxidation that leads to the development of atherosclerosis. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time the essential requirement of LRP for the cell-mediated oxidation of LDL by 12/15-lipoxygenase. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was obtained from Nissui (Tokyo, Japan), fetal bovine serum from JRH biosciences (Lenexa, KS), Sepasol from Nacalai (Kyoto, Japan), SuperScript II reverse transcriptase from Life Technologies, Inc., ExTaq DNA polymerase from Takara (Kyoto, Japan), [α-32P]dCTP (110 TBq/mmol), Megaprime DNA labeling system and Hybond N+ nylon membrane from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, QuikHyb hybridization solution from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), lipoprotein-deficient serum and calf thymus DNA from Sigma, restriction enzymes from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan), 2-thiobarbituric acid and 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane (malondialdehyde bis) from Wako (Osaka, Japan), nickel-nitrilotriacetate agarose from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany), and 3,3′-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine (DiI)-LDL from Molecular Probes (Junction City, OR). Oligodeoxyribonucleotides for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were synthesized by Hokkaido System Science (Sapporo, Japan). Antisense and sense oligodeoxyribonucleotides synthesized by the phosphorothioate approach using tetraethylthiuram disulfate (27Yonekura H. Migita H. Sakurai S. Wang H. Harada S. Abedin M.J. Yamagishi S. Yamamoto H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2591-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were obtained from Greiner (Tokyo, Japan). A murine macrophage-like cell line, J774A.1, was provided kindly by Dr. Y. Saeki of Shiga University of Medical Science. An expression vector, pEF-BOS (28Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar), having a powerful elongation factor-1α promoter was provided kindly by Dr. S. Nagata of Osaka University. An anti-LRP antibody (29Kowal R.C. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Esser V. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5810-5814Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Michael R. Brown of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. J774A.1 cells transfected with the pEF-BOS vector carrying porcine leukocyte 12/15-lipoxygenase cDNA and mock-transfected cells were established as described previously (21Sakashita T. Takahashi Y. Kinoshita T. Yoshimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. The cells were subcultured every 2–3 days using a standard trypsin protocol. Human LDL (relative density = 1.019–1.063) was prepared from fresh plasma of healthy volunteers by sequential floating ultracentrifugation in potassium bromide density gradient (21Sakashita T. Takahashi Y. Kinoshita T. Yoshimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). Approximately 20 mg of protein of LDL was obtained from 50 ml of plasma. LDL was stored at 4 °C in the dark and used within 2 weeks. EDTA was removed from the LDL by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 24 h before each experiment. A synthetic peptide, CDSDRDCLDGSDE, was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The peptide represents 106–118 amino acid residues in the third cysteine-rich repeat of the ligand binding domain of the human LDL receptor and shares 92% identity with the mouse receptor. Rabbits were immunized with the conjugate in Freund's complete adjuvants and subsequently received six booster injections at 2-week intervals. IgG was purified from rabbit serum by ammonium sulfate precipitation and protein A-Sepharose chromatography according to manufacturer protocol. Specificity of the anti-LDL receptor antibody was confirmed by Western blotting using a membrane fraction from Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human LDL receptor and HepG2 cells. The 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells (2 × 105) were incubated with 400 μg/ml of LDL in 100 μl of DMEM without serum for 12 h, and the culture medium was subjected to TBARS assay as described previously (21Sakashita T. Takahashi Y. Kinoshita T. Yoshimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Total RNA was isolated from 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells using Sepasol according to manufacturer instructions. cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT)12–18 as a primer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. PCR was carried out with ExTaq DNA polymerase and primers as shown in Table I under the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. An equal amount of aliquots from 15 and 20 thermocycles was electrophoresed in 2% agarose gel. The amplified DNAs were transferred to a nylon membrane and fixed by UV irradiation. The membrane was hybridized in QuikHyb hybridization solution with cDNA for the LDL receptor, LRP, scavenger receptor BI, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which had been labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Megaprime DNA labeling system. After washing the membrane, radioactivity was analyzed by a Fujix BAS1000 imaging analyzer (Tokyo, Japan). Nucleotide sequences of the LDL receptor, LRP, scavenger receptor BI, GAPDH, and heparin-binding protein 44 (see below) were determined by dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing kit using an automated DNA sequencer ABI PRISM 310 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Table IPrimers of PCRPrimerSequenceLength of PCR productbase pairsGAPDH-1F5′-GAGAACGGGAAGCTTGTCATCAATGG-3′339GAPDH-2R5′-AGTTGAGTCCTTCCACGATACCAAAG-3′LDL receptor-1F5′-GAAGACTCATGCAGCAGGAACG-3′468LDL receptor-2R5′-CTCATCGGAGCCGTCAACACAG-3′LRP-1F5′-GTATCTCAAAGGGCTGGCGGTG-3′619LRP-2R5′-TGCACCCAGCATACGGTCTC-3′Scavenger receptor BI-1F5′-CTCGGCGTTGTCATGATCCTCAT-3′912Scavenger receptor BI-2R5′-GCCAGACTCTCGGCATGGGCAGA-3′ Open table in a new tab The full-length cDNA for hexahistidine-tagged (underlined below) heparin-binding protein 44 (32Furukawa T. Ozawa M. Huang R.P. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was prepared with total RNA from J774A.1 cells by RT-PCR using the following primers: upstream, 5′-TCTAGAATGGGGGGTTCTCATCATCATCATCATCATTACTCGCGAGAGAAGAACGAGCC-3′, and downstream, 5′-TCTAGATCAGAGCTCATTGTGCCGAGCCC-3′. The cDNA was subcloned in pCR2.1 and then ligated to the pEF-BOS vector. The resultant plasmid was introduced into COS-7 cells by the DEAE-dextran method (33Qiao N. Takahashi Y. Takamatsu H. Yoshimoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). After incubation for 48 h, the cells were harvested and sonicated on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. β-Octylglucopyranoside at 50 mm was added, and the lysate was incubated on ice for 1 h (34Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 250,000 × gat 4 °C for 30 min, the supernatant was subjected to nickel-nitrilotriacetate agarose column chromatography using manufacturer instructions. The histidine-tagged heparin-binding protein 44 was eluted with 0.2 m histidine in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4. Sequences of sense and antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides for the LDL receptor, LRP, and scavenger receptor BI are shown in Table II. To destroy secondary structure the oligodeoxyribonucleotides were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then chilled on ice. 12/15-Lipoxygenase-expressing cells were incubated with 25 μm of the oligodeoxyribonucleotides in DMEM supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum for 7 days (27Yonekura H. Migita H. Sakurai S. Wang H. Harada S. Abedin M.J. Yamagishi S. Yamamoto H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2591-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated further for 12 h with 400 μg/ml LDL followed by TBARS assay. The oligodeoxyribonucleotides-treated cells were also subjected to RT-PCR analysis for the LDL receptor, LRP, and scavenger receptor BI.Table IIAntisense repertoiresOligodeoxyribonucleotidesSequenceLDL receptor sense5′-ATGAGCACCGCGGATCTGAT-3′LDL receptor anti-sense5′-ATCAGATCCGCGGTGCTCAT-3′LRP sense5′-ATGCTGACCCCGCCGTTGCT-3′LRP anti-sense5′-AGCAACGGCGGGGTCAGCAT-3′Scavenger receptor BI sense5′-ATGGGCGGCAGCTCCAGGGC-3′Scavenger receptor BI anti-sense5′-GCCCTGGAGCTGCCGCCCAT-3′ Open table in a new tab The 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. DiI-LDL at 5 μg of protein/ml was added, and the cells were incubated further for 2 h. After washing the cells three times at 4 °C, photographs were taken using an Olympus BX-50/BX-FLA fluorescent microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an appropriate excitation filter (35Stephan Z.F. Yurachek E.C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 325-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For flow-cytometric analysis, the cells were dispersed with trypsin, washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The 6 × 103 cells were analyzed in each experiment using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) equipped with an argon ion laser that emits at 488 nm. Forward and side scatter were adjusted to exclude debris and dead cells. The mean fluorescence intensity was determined after subtracting the auto fluorescence obtained from the cells incubated in the absence of DiI-LDL. We previously reported that the 12/15-lipoxygenase of porcine leukocytes overexpressed in macrophage-like J774A.1 cells was responsible for oxidative modification of LDL in the medium (21Sakashita T. Takahashi Y. Kinoshita T. Yoshimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As shown in the control of Fig.1, the oxidation of LDL by the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells was 3.7 times higher than that by mock-transfected cells as determined by TBARS generation. To explore mechanisms of the LDL oxidation caused by intracellular 12/15-lipoxygenase, we examined the possible involvement of the LDL receptor expressed on the surface of 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells. It is known that expression of the LDL receptor is down-regulated by the incubation of the cells with LDL or cholesterol and up-regulated by the incubation of lipoprotein-deficient serum (36Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1975; 6: 307-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In fact, as shown in Fig. 2, incubation of the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells with LDL or cholesterol decreased the mRNA level of the LDL receptor by 77 and 58%, respectively, as determined by RT-PCR using each set of primers shown in Table I. In contrast, incubation of the cells with lipoprotein-deficient serum increased the mRNA of the LDL receptor by 2.6 times under our experimental conditions. We examined whether the LDL oxidation would be changed by the above-mentioned preincubations. As shown in Fig. 1, TBARS generation by the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells was reduced by 39 and 19% after the preincubation of the cells with LDL and cholesterol, respectively. On the other hand, an ∼2-fold increase in TBARS generation was observed after the preincubation of the cells with lipoprotein-deficient serum. There were no apparent changes of TBARS generation in mock-transfected cells preincubated with LDL, cholesterol, or lipoprotein-deficient serum (Fig. 1, open bars). These results suggest that the LDL oxidation by the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells is mediated by either the LDL receptor or other cell surface proteins that bind to native LDL and are down- and up-regulated by the culture conditions described above. It was reported that LRP and scavenger receptor BI bound to native LDL and expressed in J774A.1 cells (22Hiltunen T.P. Yla-Herttuala S. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 137: S81-S88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 37Wu S.M. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We then examined whether expression levels of these receptors would be altered by the different culture conditions. RT-PCR was carried out to analyze the mRNA level of these receptors in the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells preincubated with LDL, cholesterol, or lipoprotein-deficient serum. Primers for GAPDH were also included as internal control for RNA quantity and integrity. As shown in Fig. 2A, aliquots from 15 and 20 cycles were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to verify the linearity of PCR amplification. The LRP mRNA level of the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells was decreased by preincubation with LDL and cholesterol to 65 and 62% of the control, respectively. The LRP expression was up-regulated 1.3-fold after the preincubation of the cells with lipoprotein-deficient serum (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, scavenger receptor BI mRNA expression apparently did not change under the same preincubation conditions.Figure 2Changes of expression level of LDL-binding receptors under different culture conditions. A, the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h, and abbreviations are as described in the Fig. 1 legend. Total RNA from the treated cells was subjected to RT-PCR analysis for the LDL receptor (LDLR), LRP, and scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI); bp, base pairs. GAPDH (339 base pairs) was also amplified as an internal standard. B, radioactivity was quantified and normalized with that of GAPDH. The ratios to control are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Heparin-binding protein 44, a mouse homologue of human LRP receptor-associated protein, is a universal antagonist of the LDL receptor family including the LDL receptor and LRP and inhibits the binding of LDL (38Strickland D.K.

Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effect of heparin-binding protein 44 on the 12/15-lipoxygenase-mediated LDL oxidation, the hexahistidine-tagged heparin-binding protein 44 was expressed in COS-7 cells and purified by affinity chromatography. The 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing or mock-transfected cells were incubated with LDL in the presence of the purified heparin-binding protein 44. As shown in Fig. 3A, heparin-binding protein 44 inhibited TBARS generation in a concentration-dependent fashion, and a maximal inhibition was observed at a concentration as low as 2 μg/ml. These results suggest that the LDL receptor and/or LRP are involved in the LDL oxidation by intracellular 12/15-lipoxygenase. To examine whether the LDL receptor and LRP are involved in the cell-mediated LDL oxidation, we employed antibodies against the LDL receptor (this study) and LRP (29Kowal R.C. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Esser V. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5810-5814Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), both of which blocked the LDL binding to the cells. The LDL binding to the LDL receptor was inhibited almost completely by 10 μg/ml IgG against the LDL receptor (data not shown). The 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells and mock-transfected cells then were incubated with 400 μg/ml LDL in the serum-free DMEM in the presence of the anti-LDL receptor IgG at 37 °C for 12 h. As shown in Fig. 3B, the 12/15-lipoxygenase-mediated TBARS generation was not inhibited by the antibody at concentrations up to 50 μg/ml. It should be noted that the anti-LRP antibody suppressed TBARS generation by the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). The TBARS generation was inhibited by more than 90% with 10 μl/ml antiserum. The anti-LRP antibody had no effects on the LDL oxidation by CuSO4 or mock-transfected cells. On the other hand, the nonimmunized rabbit serum was without effect on the TBARS generation. The results strongly suggest that LRP is at least one of the receptors required for the LDL oxidation by 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells. To confirm the role of LRP in cell-mediated LDL oxidation, antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides complementary to the 5′ region of the mouse LRP, LDL receptor, and scavenger receptor BI mRNA containing the initiator AUG codon were synthesized as well as the corresponding sense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (Table II). After incubation of the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells with the antisense or sense oligodeoxyribonucleotides for 7 days, RT-PCR analysis was carried out. As shown in Fig.4A, the antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides inhibited the mRNA expression of respective receptors, whereas the sense oligodeoxyribonucleotides did not inhibit the receptor expression. We performed Western blotting for LRP and the LDL receptor, but the specific bands were not observed probably because of the low expression of these receptors. We then examined the TBARS generation by the 12/15-lipoxygenase cells after the treatment with the antisense or sense oligodeoxyribonucleotides. As shown in Fig. 4B, the antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides against LRP suppressed TBARS generation in the culture medium by the 12/15-lipoxygenase cells by 67% as compared with control incubation, whereas sense oligodeoxyribonucleotides did not inhibit the TBARS generation. As anticipated from the data in Fig. 3B, antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides against the LDL receptor or scavenger receptor BI did not affect the TBARS generation by the 12/15-lipoxygenase cells. These results taken together indicate that LRP is responsible for the 12/15-lipoxygenase cell-mediated LDL oxidation, and neither the LDL receptor nor scavenger receptor BI is involved in this process. To confirm the specific binding of native LDL to LRP, fluorescence-labeled LDL, DiI-LDL, was incubated with the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells. After a 2-h incubation, bright fluorescence was observed in most of the cells (Fig.5A), whereas little or no fluorescence in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled LDL (Fig. 5D). When the LRP (Fig. 5B) or the LDL receptor (Fig. 5C) was blocked by co-incubation of the antibodies with DiI-LDL, much less fluorescence was observed in the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells as compared with the control incubation. The means of the fluorescence intensity as determined by the flow-cytometric analysis was decreased by 39, 41, and 78% in the presence of anti-LRP antibody at 10 μl/ml, anti-LDL receptor IgG at 50 μg/ml, and a 100-fold excess of unlabeled LDL, respectively. This result indicates that LRP as well as the LDL receptor is responsible for the specific binding of LDL to the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells. LRP was shown to be expressed in the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing J774A.1 cells and responsible for cell-mediated LDL oxidation by these cells. The LRP expression was down-regulated by incubations with LDL or cholesterol and up-regulated by lipoprotein-deficient serum (Fig. 2). A previous study showed that LRP expression was not changed significantly by cholesterol loading in the LDL receptor-deficient human fibroblasts (29Kowal R.C. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Esser V. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5810-5814Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The reasons for apparently different response of LRP expression to cholesterol are not known and may be the difference of cell types used in the experiments. It should be emphasized that changes of both LDL oxidation and LRP expression of the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells coincided under the above culture conditions (Figs. 1 and 2). The change of LDL oxidation was not caused by the alteration of 12/15-lipoxygenase expression, because the enzyme activity did not change significantly under these culture conditions (data not shown). Involvement of LRP in the LDL oxidation by 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells is also supported by the experiment with heparin-binding protein 44. This protein is a mouse homologue of the human LRP receptor-associated protein, is a universal antagonist of the LDL receptor family, and inhibits the binding of LDL to the LDL receptor and LRP (38Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Battey F. Behre E. McTigue K. Battey J.F. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13364-13369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Medh J.D. Fry G.L. Bowen S.L.

The LDL oxidation caused by the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells was blocked by heparin-binding protein 44, confirming that LDL binding to cell surface receptors was necessary for the cell-mediated LDL oxidation (Fig. 3A). The LDL oxidation by 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells was blocked by an anti-LRP antibody in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3C). Furthermore, antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides against LRP that suppressed the mRNA expression of LRP also inhibited the LDL oxidation (Fig. 4). We tested whether LRP could mediate LDL oxidation by thioglycollate-induced peritoneal macrophages of C57BL/6 mice (42Zhuang D. Kawajiri H. Takahashi Y. Yoshimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The anti-LRP serum at 10 μl/ml inhibited LDL oxidation by 56.3%. The LDL oxidation as determined by TBARS of 1 × 105 peritoneal macrophages was 0.39 ± 0.03 (n = 4) nmol of malondialdehyde/mg of LDL, and that of 2 × 105 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing J774A.1 cells was 0.26 ± 0.07 (n = 4) nmol of malondialdehyde/mg of LDL. When the 12/15-lipoxygenase activity of these cells was determined using 25 μm exogenous arachidonic acid as substrate (21Sakashita T. Takahashi Y. Kinoshita T. Yoshimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it was 74.8 and 37.2 nmol/10 min/mg of protein, respectively. Our results taken together suggest that LRP, at least in part, mediates the LDL oxidation not only by 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing J774A.1 cells but also by normal macrophages, which express 12/15-lipoxygenase at a high level and accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions (16Yla-Herttuala S. Rosenfeld M.E. Parthasarathy S. Sigal E. Sarkioja T. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1146-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 22Hiltunen T.P. Yla-Herttuala S. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 137: S81-S88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The very low level of LDL oxidation by mock-transfected cells that hardly expressed 12/15-lipoxygenase was not affected by heparin-binding protein 44 or an anti-LRP antibody, suggesting 12/15-lipoxygenase-independent LDL oxidation, if any, was not mediated by LRP. We could not detect specific bands of LRP or the LDL receptor by Western blotting, suggesting that the expression level of these receptors in the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells was not high. However, antibodies against these two receptors significantly inhibited binding of DiI-LDL to these cells as assessed by flow-cytometric analysis, indicating that functional receptors were definitely expressed in these cells. Small fluorescence was still observed even when both antibodies were added at the same time to the cells incubated with DiI-LDL (data not shown). The results agree with the expression of scavenger receptor BI in these cells and also suggest the presence of other LDL-binding receptors. The LDL receptor did not seem to be involved in the cell-mediated LDL oxidation (Figs. 3B and 4B). This is in good agreement with the previous reports showing that macrophages prepared from the LDL receptor-deficient mouse could oxidize LDL to the same extent as the wild-type mouse (24Tangirala R.K. Mol M.J. Steinberg D. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the LDL receptor processes native LDL via receptor-mediated endocytosis in which the LDL particle is delivered to lysosomes, in which cholesteryl ester is hydrolyzed to free cholesterol for use by the cells (43Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 897-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar). LRP is a multiligand receptor, and the binding of ligands to the receptor is usually followed by receptor-mediated endocytosis and degradation of the ligands in lysosomes (26Willnow T.E. Sheng Z. Ishibashi S. Herz J. Science. 1994; 264: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, a recent paper reported that LRP also mediated the selective uptake of cholesteryl ester in LDL, which is transferred to the plasma membrane without internalization and degradation of LDL particles (44Swarnakar S. Beers J. Strickland D.K. Azhar S. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21121-21128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is possible that the cholesteryl ester in the plasma membrane is oxygenated directly by the intracellular 12/15-lipoxygenase followed by reincorporation to the LDL particles (45Kuhn H. Belkner J. Suzuki H. Yamamoto S. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1749-1759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Takahashi Y. Glasgow W.C. Suzuki H. Taketani Y. Yamamoto S. Anton M. Kuhn H. Brash A.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Scavenger receptor BI is an 82-kDa protein that binds high density lipoprotein, LDL, modified LDL, and very low density lipoprotein (47de Villiers W.J. Smart E.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 66: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The receptor is expressed on the surface of macrophage in atherosclerotic lesions (22Hiltunen T.P. Yla-Herttuala S. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 137: S81-S88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It was reported that scavenger receptor BI, similar to LRP, mediates the selective uptake of cholesteryl ester in LDL and high density lipoprotein (48Swarnakar S. Temel R.E. Connelly M.A. Azhar S. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29733-29739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 49Stangl H. Hyatt M. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). However, mRNA expression of scavenger receptor BI was not altered by the preincubation with LDL, cholesterol, or lipoprotein-deficient serum under our experimental conditions (Fig. 2). Furthermore, no inhibition of LDL oxidation by antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides against scavenger receptor BI suggests a trivial role of this receptor (Fig.4). The reason that scavenger receptor BI is not responsible for the cell-mediated LDL oxidation is not known, but this receptor could be involved in the LDL oxidation in the other experimental systems (48Swarnakar S. Temel R.E. Connelly M.A. Azhar S. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29733-29739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). LRP was reported to bind to a variety of ligands including LDL, α2-macroglobulin, very low density lipoprotein remnants, plasminogen activator, and so on (41Willnow T.E. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, the receptor has been postulated to participate in a number of diverse physiological and pathological processes such as the homeostasis of plasma lipoproteins and atherosclerosis, fibrinolysis, and neuronal regeneration (41Willnow T.E. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A recent study revealed the role of the receptor in clearance of chylomicron remnants by inducible disruption of “hepatic” LRP in mice (51Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Our study implicates a novel function of “macrophage” LRP in the 12/15-lipoxygenase-mediated LDL oxidation as the initial trigger of the progression of atherosclerosis. Further investigations are needed to explore the LRP-mediated LDL oxidation in detail in relation to other receptors and cellular factors. We are indebted to Drs. H. Yonekura, O. Amano, and A.

Findings made using this methodology have been used to support the concept that insulin stimulates its own release. In the present studies, the effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine on stimulated insulin secretion from isolated perifused rat islets was determined. When added together with stimulatory glucose, 5-hydroxytryptamine (0.5 mm) significantly reduced both phases of 8 mm glucose-induced secretion and reduced the first phase of 15 mmglucose-induced release by 60% without any effect on sustained insulin release rates.

Over 30 years ago (1Sodoyez J.-C. Sodoyez-Goffaux F. Foà P.P. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1969; 130: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 2Iversen J. Miles D.W.

Zawalich K.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3287-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), in agreement with several prior studies (11Hagiwara S. Sakurai T. Tashiro F. Hashimoto Y. Matsuda Y.

This conclusion was based upon insulin secretion measurements from isolated perifused rat islets that retain physiologic insulin secretory responses similar to those observed using the perfused rat pancreas preparation (13Gerich J.E. Charles M.A. Grodsky G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 54: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 14Curry D.L.

Invest. 1974; 54: 819-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We also suggested that an impairment in PI3K signaling in β-cells might be responsible for the hyperinsulinemia noted in a variety of insulin-resistant states including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Thus, whereas disruption of PI3K signaling results in insulin resistance in peripheral insulin-dependent tissues (16Kim Y.-B. Nikoulina S.E. Ciaraldi T.P. Henry R.R. Kahn B.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 17Cusi K. Maezono K. Osman A. Pendergrass M. Patti M.E. Pratipanawatr T. DeFronzo R.A. Kahn C.R. Mandarino L.J. J. Clin.

This elegant communications network allows the β-cell to match the degree of insulin resistance and the secretion of insulin thus maintaining glucose tolerance. This concept presupposes that insulin exerts a negative feedback effect on its own secretion and utilizes the same biochemical signaling systems described in liver, muscle, and adipose tissues (18Virkamäki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 19Kahn B.B. Flier S.J. J. Clin.

In contrast to the numerous studies demonstrating that insulin inhibits its own secretion (1Sodoyez J.-C. Sodoyez-Goffaux F. Foà P.P. Proc. Soc. Exp.

Amperometrically measured spikes of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) release from β-cells preincubated in 0.5 mm 5HT for 16 h provided the experimental support for this concept. This method takes advantage of the fact that amperometric measurements of 5HT release from preloaded β-cells can be used as a surrogate marker for insulin release and has been utilized by several groups (21Aspinwall C.A.

It is based upon earlier studies in which 5HT was found to be localized in islet secretory granules and thought to be cosecreted with insulin (27Gylfe E. J. Endocrinol. 1978; 78: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Not all reports, however, agreed with this concept (28Hellman B. Lernmark A. Sehlin J. Täljedal I.-B. Biochem.

Horm. Metab. Res. 1971; 3: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Gagliardino J.J. Nierle C. Pfeiffer E.F. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the possibility that 5HT preloading might negatively affect secretion was not examined in any of these amperometry studies. In an attempt to resolve the opposite concepts with regard to the inhibitory or stimulatory effects of insulin on β-cell secretion, we conducted studies with islets treated with 0.5 mm 5HT. In agreement with several previous studies (29Lernmark A. Horm. Metab. Res. 1971; 3: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Gagliardino J.J. Nierle C. Pfeiffer E.F. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we observed that 5HT exerts profound acute and long lasting inhibitory effects on glucose-induced insulin secretion from perifused rat islets. It also abolished tolbutamide-induced secretion as well. The concept that amperometric measurements of 5HT release from β-cells reflect the physiologic regulation of insulin secretion should be reconsidered. The detailed methodologies employed to assess insulin output from collagenase-isolated rat islets have been described previously (10Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3287-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 166: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (350–475 g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, MA). All animals were treated in a manner that complied with the NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (41National Institutes of Health NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, NIH Publication No. 85-23. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1985Google Scholar). The animals were fed ad libitum. After intraperitoneal Nembutal (pentobarbital sodium, 50 mg/kg; Abbott, North Chicago, IL)-induced anesthesia, islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and hand-picked, using a glass loop pipette, under a stereo microscope. They were free of exocrine contamination. After isolation, groups of 16–18 islets were loaded onto nylon filters (Tetko, Inc., Briarcliff Manor, NY), placed in small glass vials, and incubated for 3 h in 400 μl of a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) solution containing 0.5 mm 5HT plus 5 mm glucose. This solution, oxygenated and warmed (37 °C), was gently added to the vial with islets. The vial was capped with a rubber stopper and gassed for 10 s with 95% O2, 5%CO2. The vials were again gently oxygenated after 90 min. After the preloading period, the islets still on nylon filters were washed with 5 ml of fresh KRB and perifused as described below. Groups of 14–18 freshly isolated or preincubated islets were perifused with KRB at a flow rate of 1 ml/min for 30 min, usually with 3 mm glucose, to establish basal and stable insulin secretory rates. In some experiments 0.5 mm 5HT was included during this period. After this 30-min stabilization period they were then perifused with the appropriate agonist or agonist combinations as indicated in the figure legends and under “Results.” Perifusate solutions were gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and maintained at 37 °C. Insulin released into the medium was measured by radioimmunoassay (32Albano J.D.M. Ekins R.P. Maritz G. Turner R.C. Acta Endocrinol. 1972; 70: 487-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Hanks' solution was used for the islet isolation. The perifusion medium consisted of 115 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 24 mm NaHCO3, and 0.17 g/dl bovine serum albumin. The 125I-labeled insulin used for the insulin assay was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Bovine serum albumin (radioimmunoassay grade), glucose, 5-HT hydrochloride, and the salts used to make the Hanks' solution and perifusion medium were purchased from Sigma. Rat insulin standard (lot 615-ZS-157) was the generous gift of Dr. Gerald Gold, Eli Lilly Co. (Indianapolis, IN). Collagenase (Type P) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Statistical significance was determined using the Student's t test for unpaired data or analysis of variance in conjunction with the Newman-Keuls test for unpaired data. Ap value less than or equal to 0.05 was taken as significant. Values presented in the figures and under “Results” represent means ± S.E. of at least three observations. In the initial series of experiments islets were perifused immediately after isolation. In response to 8 mm glucose, insulin secretory rates increased most significantly during the final 20 min of the perifusion (Fig.1, top panel). For example, 20, 30, or 40 min after the onset of stimulation with 8 mmglucose, secretory rates averaged 159 ± 14, 199 ± 25, or 214 ± 18 pg/islet/min (n = 6). The inclusion of 5HT during the stimulatory period with 8 mm glucose significantly reduced islet insulin secretory responses. For example, 20, 30, or 40 min after the onset of stimulation with 8 mmglucose, secretory rates now averaged 87 ± 20, 102 ± 15, or 112 ± 12 pg/islet/min (n = 4). Peak first phase release noted during the initial minutes of 8 mm glucose stimulation was also impaired by the inclusion of 0.5 mm5HT. They averaged 89 ± 7 pg/islet/min from control islets and 62 ± 6 pg/islet/min from islets stimulated with the combination of 8 mm glucose plus 5HT. When stimulated with 15 mm glucose, control islets responded with a brisk biphasic insulin secretory response (Fig. 1,bottom panel). Peak first phase secretion averaged 177 ± 21 pg/islet/min whereas release rates measured 35–40 min after the onset of stimulation increased to 834 ± 80 pg/islet/min (n = 8). The presence of 0.5 mm 5HT during stimulation with 15 mm glucose significantly reduced peak first phase secretion, which fell from 177 ± 21 pg/islet/min from control islets to 76 ± 9 pg/islet/min (n = 4) in the presence of 5HT, a reduction of ∼60%. Rates of insulin secretion during the final 20 min of stimulation with 15 mm glucose (745 ± 32 pg/islet/min) were comparable with those from control islets. In the amperometric studies in which 5HT oxidation was used as the index of insulin secretion (21Aspinwall C.A. Lakey J.R.T. Kennedy R.T. J. Biol.

In the next series of studies, we explored the impact of prior exposure to 5HT on insulin secretion. Two different protocols were employed. In the first series of studies, 0.5 mm 5HT was included together with 3 mm glucose only during the initial 30-min stabilization period of the perifusion with 3 mm glucose. Similar to the amperometric studies conducted with 5HT-preloaded islets (21Aspinwall C.A. Lakey J.R.T. Kennedy R.T. J. Biol.

Most dramatic was the reduction in peak first phase secretion, which was decreased to 49 ± 14 pg/islet/min (n = 4). The impact of 5HT on secretion was evident during the entire 40-min stimulatory period with 15 mm glucose alone. Thus, despite its absence from the perifusion medium for 40 min, the adverse effect of 5HT on release is sustained. In the next series of experiments, islets were first exposed to 0.5 mm 5HT for 3 h. This period of preexposure was chosen because longer culture periods result in a deterioration of glucose-induced secretion (33Malaisse-Lagae F. Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Acta Diabetol. Lat. 1987; 24: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34Metz S.A. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 3-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Kelley G.G. Acta Diabetol. 1995; 32: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), a situation that might complicate interpretation of the findings. The islets were then perifused for 30 min with 3 mm glucose alone prior to stimulation. The results are presented in Fig. 3. In response to 200 μm tolbutamide a small increase in secretion from control islets was observed only during the initial few minutes of stimulation (Fig. 3, top panel). This agrees with previous studies that have demonstrated a marked glucose dependence for the insulin stimulatory effect of sulfonylurea (36Grodsky G.M., G.H., E. Fanska R. Karam J.H. Fed. Proc. 1977; 36: 2714-2719PubMed Google Scholar, 37Curry D.L. Bennett L.L. Grodsky G.M. Endocrinology. 1968; 83: 572-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 38Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 816-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After prior exposure to 0.5 mm 5HT for 3 h, this minimal secretory response was abolished. In response to 15 mm glucose, control islets responded with a biphasic insulin secretory response (Fig. 3, bottom panel). First phase release averaged 196 ± 21 pg/islet/min whereas sustained rates of secretion averaged 570 ± 57 pg/islet/min (n = 9) during the final 5 min of stimulation. Similar to the findings made when 5HT-preloaded islets were stimulated with tolbutamide, the response to 15 mmglucose was significantly reduced by a 3-h exposure to 5HT. Most dramatic was the reduction in the first phase response, which declined from 196 ± 21 pg/islet/min to 60 ± 16 pg/islet/min (n = 5). The adverse effect of 5HT preexposure on glucose-induced insulin release was sustained for at least 70 min. Release rates measured 35–40 min after the onset of 15 mmglucose were still significantly less than control islet responses. They averaged 240 ± 38 pg/islet/min in the 5HT-pretreated islets at this time point. In an attempt to improve the time resolution between the electrical and secretory events that participate in insulin release, several groups have employed amperometry (21Aspinwall C.A. Lakey J.R.T.

This technique has also been applied to insulin receptor substrate-1 gene-disrupted β-cells as well (25Aspinwall C.A. Qian W.-J. Roper M.G. Kulkarni R.N. Kahn C.R. Kennedy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22331-22338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Initially employed in studies using adrenal chromaffin cells (39Chow R.H. Ruden L. Neher E. Nature. 1992; 356: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), secretion is detected with this methodology by a carbon fiber electrode placed next to the cell of interest. As described by Ashcroft and co-workers (23Smith P.A. Duchen M.R. Ashcroft F.M. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 808-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) “the electrode is held at or above the oxidation potential of the secreted compound and secretion monitored by the current associated with the oxidation of the vesicle contents.” The method is only applicable to readily oxidized compounds, but unfortunately, insulin is not such a compound. To circumvent this shortcoming of insulin, these groups have preloaded β-cells for 4–16 h with 5HT, a highly electroactive compound (21Aspinwall C.A. Lakey J.R.T. Kennedy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6360-6365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 22Smith P. Duchen M. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 475P: 157Google Scholar, 23Smith P.A.

Chem. 1996; 270: 270-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because it appears to be confined to secretory granules, it has been assumed in these amperometric studies that the secretion of 5HT accurately reflects the physiologic secretion of insulin. Unfortunately, in none of these aforementioned β-cell amperometric studies was insulin secretion actually measured. It was assumed to occur in parallel with the amperometric changes induced by the oxidation of 5HT. In the present series of experiments, insulin secretion from perifused rat islets was measured during acute exposure to or after a 30-min to 3-h preloading period with 5HT. The level of 5HT (0.5 mm) employed was identical to that used in the amperometric studies. The exposure times to 5HT were not as prolonged. However, considering the time-dependent inhibitory actions of 5HT noted in our studies, the adverse effects of more prolonged exposure to 5HT on stimulated secretion may be even more severe than demonstrated here. In response to 8 mm glucose, a modest insulin secretory response was evoked from control rat islets. Second phase release rates after 40 min of stimulation were increased 4–6-fold above prestimulatory rates whereas the initial response, although modest, was approximately doubled. The inclusion of 5HT together with 8 mm glucose significantly reduced both phases of 8 mm glucose-induced secretion. Using a higher glucose level (15 mm) resulted in a more pronounced first phase response and a large rising second phase response from control islets. Inclusion of 5HT during acute stimulation with 15 mm glucose reduced the peak first phase response by about 60%. Sustained second phase release rates were comparable with control values. Preexposure to 0.5 mm 5HT for either 30 min or 3 h resulted in a profound suppression of both phases of 15 mmglucose-induced release. Thus, in agreement with previous studies using mouse islets (29Lernmark A. Horm. Metab. Res. 1971; 3: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Gagliardino J.J. Nierle C. Pfeiffer E.F. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), 5HT is a powerful inhibitor of the insulin secretory response to glucose. In a recent report (21Aspinwall C.A. Lakey J.R.T. Kennedy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6360-6365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and in contrast to other studies in which insulin or connecting peptide levels were measured (1Sodoyez J.-C.

Diabetes. 1987; 36: 959-962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was concluded based on amperometric measurements of 5HT release that insulin stimulates its own secretion. In addition to insulin, 16-h 5HT-preloaded β-cells were also stimulated with 200 μmtolbutamide in the presence of 3 mm glucose. We performed additional studies utilizing this stimulatory protocol using islets preloaded with 5HT for 3 h. Islets were perifused and stimulated with 200 μm tolbutamide in the presence of 3 mm glucose. Consistent with previous studies using the perfused rat pancreas (36Grodsky G.M., G.H., E. Fanska R. Karam J.H. Fed. Proc. 1977; 36: 2714-2719PubMed Google Scholar) or perifused islets (38Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 816-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a small, transient, and minimal insulin secretory response that rapidly subsided was observed. Under conditions employed in these studies and in which insulin secretion rates were measured, prior exposure to 0.5 mm 5HT for 3 h abolished this weak response to tolbutamide. What is the experimental basis for suggesting that 5HT secretion mirrors physiologic insulin release? One of the earliest studies with 5HT (28Hellman B. Lernmark A. Sehlin J. Täljedal I.-B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1972; 21: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) demonstrated that neither 20 mm glucose nor the sulfonylurea glibenclamide mobilized granule-bound 5HT. In fact these two compounds tended to inhibit the efflux of 5HT under conditions in which they both stimulated insulin secretion measured in parallel studies. Other secretion studies demonstrated that 5HT profoundly reduced stimulated insulin secretion (29Lernmark A. Horm. Metab. Res. 1971; 3: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Gagliardino J.J. Nierle C. Pfeiffer E.F. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In a subsequent report (27Gylfe E. J. Endocrinol. 1978; 78: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a small, transient increase in 5HT release was observed from perifused mouse islets. One bothersome issue regarding the use of 5HT as a barometer of insulin secretion is that 11 mm glucose alone failed to increase 5HT release in most cells studied by Ashcroft and co-workers (23Smith P.A. Duchen M.R. Ashcroft F.M. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 808-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Forskolin (10 μm) had to be included together with glucose. In rat islets at least, 10 mmglucose is a powerful stimulant of insulin secretion in the absence of forskolin (40Zawalich W.S. Bonnet-Eymard M. Zawalich K.C. Metabolism. 2000; 49: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). According to Aspinwall et al. (24Aspinwall C.A. Brooks S.A. Kennedy R.T. Lakey J.R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31308-31314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), “Substantial evidence now exists that demonstrates that 5HT is loaded primarily into secretory vesicles and that 5HT is co-secreted with insulin by exocytosis (22Smith P. Duchen M. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 475P: 157Google Scholar, 23Smith P.A. Duchen M.R. Ashcroft F.M. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J.

Chem. 1996; 270: 270-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (111) Google Scholar).” The references supporting this claim were all amperometric studies unsubstantiated by actual insulin secretory measurements. Our data indicate that 5HT is a powerful inhibitor of the release process and that results obtained with 5HT have to be interpreted cautiously. In conclusion, our studies and several previous reports (29Lernmark A. Horm. Metab. Res. 1971; 3: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Gagliardino J.J. Nierle C. Pfeiffer E.F. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) demonstrate that prior exposure of β-cells to 5HT results in a profound time-dependent suppression of the insulin secretory process. The concept that the secretion of 5HT from preloaded β-cells reflects physiologic secretion is not supported by these or other studies (28Hellman B. Lernmark A. Sehlin J. Täljedal I.-B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1972; 21: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Lernmark A. Horm. Metab. Res. 1971; 3: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Gagliardino J.J. Nierle C. Pfeiffer E.F. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is premature to conclude that insulin, under physiologic conditions, stimulates its own secretion based exclusively on studies using amperometric measurements of 5HT release without substantial corroborating data including actual measurements of insulin secretion from 5HT-preloaded β-cells."

To elucidate the biosynthetic route to the Neu5Acα2–3GalNAc linkage, we tested commercial recombinant α2,3-sialyltransferases for their ability to sialylate enzymatically synthesized, unconjugated X2 pentasaccharide.

The product, representing the putative X2 pentasaccharide, GalNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc, was isolated from the reaction mixture by gel filtration chromatography. Takeya et al. (18Takeya A.

We established the structure of the putative X2 pentasaccharide by the following set of experiments. First, its MALDI-TOF mass spectrum revealed two peaks atm/z 933.33 and 949.33, which were assigned to [M + Na]+ and [M + K]+ of HexNAc1(Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc), respectively (calculated m/z 933.32 and 949.29, respectively). Second, the terminal HexNAc was sensitive to jack bean β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (data not shown), but it was not GlcNAc as it could not be galactosylated by β1,4-galactosyltransferase from bovine milk (data not shown). Finally, the HMBC spectrum of the sialyl X2 revealed that the distal β-GalNAc and the peridistal Gal of the X2 core were joined by a 1,3-bond (Fig. 7a).Enzymatic MethodsST3Gal II Reactions600 nmol of acceptor oligosaccharide and 2.4 μmol of CMP-Neu5Ac were incubated with 40 milliunits of rat recombinant ST3Gal II (α2,3-(O)-sialyltransferase, EC2.4.99.4) in 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, 0.02% NaN3, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and 8 mmMnCl2 in a reaction volume of 600 μl for 6 days at room temperature. 20 milliunits of fresh enzyme was added on day 3.

https://openalex.org/W2034000451,"The interplay between activated G proteins and intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) in the regulation of secretion was studied in the macrophage, coupling membrane capacitance with calcium-sensitive microfluorimetry. Intracellular elevation of either the nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP, guanosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS), or [Ca2+]i enhanced the amplitude and shortened the time course of stimulus-induced secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Both the ionophore- and the stimulus-induced secretory response were abolished in the presence of guanosine-5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDPβS). TheKd of Ca2+-driven secretion was independent of GTPγS concentration, whereas theKd of the GTPγS-driven response decreased from 63 to 31 μM in the presence of saturating concentrations of [Ca2+]i. The time course of stimulus-induced secretion was dependent upon the concentration of [Ca2+]i. The time course of GTPγS-driven secretion was concentration-independent at high levels of [Ca2+]i, suggesting that a calcium-dependent translocation/binding step was rate-limiting. Our data strongly support a model in which [Ca2+]i and activated G proteins act independently of one another in the sequential regulation of macrophage secretion. [Ca2+]i appears to play a role in the recruitment and priming of vesicles from reserve intracellular pools at a step that is upstream of G protein activation. While activated, G proteins appear to play a key role in fusion of docked vesicles. Thus, secretion can result either from activating more G proteins or from elevating [Ca2+]i at basal levels of G protein activation.

In addition, hematopoietic cells in general and macrophages in particular contain several distinct secretory organelles that appear to be selectively mobilized for secretion by different stimuli. In macrophages this may include different types of dense core granules as well as phagosomes and phagolysosomes. Although the initial steps in the intracellular signal transduction cascades from the receptors that eventuate secretion and/or phagocytosis are known, the Ca2+ and G protein dependence of the pathway(s) that links receptor binding and cross-linking to vesicle fusion is still unclear.In the studies described in this investigation, heat-aggregated immunoglobulin G (HAIGG),1which binds to and aggregates Fc receptors, was used to mimic immune complex stimulation. When Fcγ receptors are engaged at the cell surface by the opsonized surface of interacting particles, the resultant receptor clustering initiates tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic residues in the immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs by Src-family kinases. The resultant tyrosine-phosphorylated residues form anchoring sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins, the most important of which seems to the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Syk, which can phosphorylate several downstream substrates involved in the phagocytic response. One such substrate is the Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav, which activates the small G proteins Rac and Cdc42. HAIGG, thus, was used in our studies to maximize G protein turnover contributing to actin polymerization and, as our data demonstrate, the exocytotic fusion of vesicles. The studies were carried out to elucidate the relative roles of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and activated G proteins in mediating the secretory response in the activated macrophage.Membrane capacitance is proportional to cell surface area, and therefore, the measurement of membrane capacitance has become an important technique for studying exocytosis and endocytosis in a wide variety of secretory cells (1Neher E.

Macrophage stimulation is accompanied by a complex series of capacitance changes reflective of exocytosis and phagocytosis (12Holevinsky K.O. Nelson D.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2577-2586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this study we have taken advantage of the differential sensitivity of phagocytosis and exocytosis to temperature and [Ca2+]i to study the regulation of the stimulus-induced secretory response in isolation.Classically, in cells of neurosecretory origin, regulated secretory responses are triggered by an increase in the [[Ca2+]i] through the opening of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels. GTP-binding proteins clearly play a role, but they appear to be subservient to the primary Ca2+ signal (very little secretion occurs with GTPγS at resting [Ca2+]i levels). By contrast, the regulated secretory response of hematopoietic cells is substantially dependent on G proteins, whereas Ca2+ seems to play a more modulatory role (6Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 395: 193-214Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 13Nüsse O. Lindau M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2117-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Fernandez J.M. Neher E. Gomperts B.D. Nature. 1984; 312: 453-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Studies in permeabilized mast cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils show that secretion can be induced by GTPγS in the effective absence of [Ca2+]i(<10−9 m) (15Pinxteren J.A. O'Sullivan A.J. Larbi K.Y. Tatham P.E. Gomperts B.D. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast to mast cells, very little is known about the regulation of secretion in phagocytes, and our studies represent a first approach to this problem.Previous studies suggested that the regulated secretory response of the phagocyte, as with other cells in the immune system, are triggered by guanine nucleotides and shaped in time course by local gradients in [Ca2+]i (6Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 395: 193-214Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 13Nüsse O. Lindau M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2117-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Fernandez J.M. Neher E. Gomperts B.D. Nature. 1984; 312: 453-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). However, the interplay between the two signaling elements has made it difficult to study their individual effects, since in both mast cells and neutrophils, GTPγS induces a transient increase in [Ca2+]i in cells that are weakly Ca2+-buffered (6Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 395: 193-214Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 13Nüsse O. Lindau M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2117-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Nüsse O. Lindau M. Biosci. Rep. 1990; 10: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) by a mechanism that is still unknown. Therefore, to elucidate the role of [Ca2+]i and GTP-binding proteins in the signal transduction cascade, we studied their effects on secretion in isolation. Cells were stimulated through three pathways; they are 1) surface Fc receptor ligation by multivalent ligands that enhanced the turnover of G proteins in the presence of elevated [Ca2+]i, 2) exposure to the Ca2+ionophore A23187 in Ca2+-containing external solutions in the absence of enhanced G protein activation, and 3) intracellular application of GTPγS in highly Ca2+-buffered internal solutions with and without receptor stimulation. Previous data obtained from the mast cell indicated that [Ca2+]iinfluenced the latency and rise time but not the amplitude of the degranulation response (6Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 395: 193-214Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In our studies, both the time course and amplitude of secretion in the macrophage is a sensitive function of [Ca2+]i, suggesting that Ca2+-mediated regulatory control of secretion is present at least in some cells of hematopoietic origin. Our data suggest that, like the mast cell, Ca2+ may be permissive and GTP may be essential to the secretory process. Thus, GTPγS can elicit a capacitance increase in the nominal absence of Ca2+, and Ca2+-induced secretion is ablated by GDPβS (a GDP analogue that prevents G proteins from binding GTP). Moreover, the presence of GTPγS does not alter the Ca2+ sensitivity of secretion, whereas the Kd for GTPγS is reduced in the presence of optimal [[Ca2+]i].It has become clear that the final stages of exocytosis in cells of hematopoietic origin are determined by the activation of GTP-binding proteins. The nature of the specific G proteins involved in hematopoietic cell secretion is, however, still not entirely clear. Early investigators proposed the existence of an elusive GEprotein, implying that it was hetrotrimeric in nature (17Gomperts B.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 591-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Aridor M. Rajmilevich G. Beaven M.A. Sagi-Eisenberg R. Science. 1993; 262: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, there is a growing body of evidence that one or more of the small GTP-binding proteins, including members of the Rho family (Rho, Rac, Cdc42) as well as Ras, Rab, and ARF family members may be involved in vesicle mobilization, docking, and/or membrane fusion in cells of hematopoietic origin (15Pinxteren J.A. O'Sullivan A.J. Larbi K.Y. Tatham P.E. Gomperts B.D. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Pinxteren J.A. O'Sullivan A.J. Tatham P.E. Gomperts B.D.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). For example, antagonism of Rho family function using specific proteins appears to block mast cell degranulation in a permeabilized cell model (20Brown A.M. O'Sullivan A.J. Gomperts B.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Mariot P. O'Sullivan A.J. Brown A.M. Tatham P.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6476-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Rab GTPases appear to recruit tethering and docking proteins from the cytosol to the membrane after an interconversion between inactive, GDP-bound forms and active, GTP-bound forms, a process that does not appear to require GTP hydrolysis (22Pfeffer S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Rab not only appears to regulate vesicle docking but also has been found to enable SNARE complex formation preceding and, finally, permitting vesicle fusion (for review, see Ref. 22Pfeffer S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, our data suggest a role for a GTPase-dependent step in the final stages of vesicle fusion.The rationale for the present studies was the unresolved role that activated G proteins and Ca2+ play in the regulation of exocytosis in the macrophage. The controversy resides in Ca2+ versus the GTP sensitivity of the response. The early studies of Neher (6Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 395: 193-214Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar) on the mast cell suggest that elevations in [Ca2+]i do not lead to secretion in the absence of GTPγS. Instead it was proposed that GTPγS was involved in priming the Ca2+-regulated exocytotic response. Although Ca2+ did not initiate secretion, the response was interpreted as ultimately Ca2+-regulated in that increases in [Ca2+]i accelerated the time course of degranulation. However, the dose dependence of secretion on the levels of activated G proteins was not investigated. Our studies were carried out under conditions in which we examined the sensitivity of the G protein regulatory arm of the response in isolation from the Ca2+-dependent arm. We demonstrate that the pathway linking receptor binding and exocytosis induced by human HAIGG involves both G protein activation and calcium signaling as independent yet synergistic secretory stimuli. Although activated G proteins are both necessary and sufficient stimuli for secretion, the response in the macrophage is highly sensitive to changes in [Ca2+]i both in amplitude and time course. The fact that GTPγS increases the amplitude but not the sensitivity of Ca2+-driven exocytosis suggests that the Ca2+regulatory step is independent and upstream of the G protein-sensitive step and that the two regulatory pathways are additive. The observation that Ca2+ shifts the sensitivity of GTPγS-induced secretion indicates that the activated G protein-sensitive step is downstream of the Ca2+ regulatory step, and its sensitivity can be enhanced by Ca2+ priming. Therefore, unlike secretion in the mast cell, where GTP increases the Ca2+sensitivity of exocytosis (6Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 395: 193-214Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and G proteins are thought to prime a Ca2+ regulated response, in our studies of stimulus-induced secretion in the macrophage, Ca2+ enhances the sensitivity of a GTP-dependent process.DISCUSSIONWe have studied quantitatively the regulation of exocytosis in single cells from the murine macrophage cell line J774 using high resolution time-resolved membrane capacitance techniques. We have examined the interaction of cytosolic Ca2+ and activated G proteins in the control of commitment to vesicle fusion in exocytosis after surface receptor binding.The Isolation of Exocytosis from PhagocytosisFocal exocytosis and eventual particle uptake are tightly linked and highly regulated sequelae after binding to surface receptors in mononuclear phagocytes. In support of this observation, our studies demonstrate a rapid secretory phase in the capacitance record that precedes the phagocytic uptake of the multivalent HAIGG bound to surface Fc receptors for immunoglobulin G. Our capacitance observations are consistent with the studies of Bajno et al. (31Bajno L. Peng X.-R. Schreiber A. Moore H.-P. Trimble W. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), who were able to demonstrate focal exocytosis of endosomal vesicles at sites of phagosome formation. To study the regulation of the exocytic signaling pathway initiated after particle binding to the macrophage surface receptors, we took advantage of the differential temperature and [Ca2+]i sensitivity to separate the two tightly coupled events.Although it is well established that phagocytosis is highly temperature-dependent (32Heymann D. Guicheux J. Rousselle A.V. Histol. Histopathol. 2001; 16: 37-44PubMed Google Scholar, 33Griffin Jr., F.M. Griffin J.A. Leider J.E. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1975; 142: 1263-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 34Illinger D. Poindron P. Kuhry J.G. Biol. Cell. 1991; 73: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the question of whether or not phagocytosis is a Ca2+-dependent process has been at issue for some time. Fc receptor-mediated particle uptake has been observed to occur in the absence of changes in [Ca2+]i when averaged over the whole cell (35McNeil P. Swanson J. Wright S. Silverstein S. Taylor D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 1986: 1586-1592Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 36DiVirgilio F. Meyer B.C. Greenberg S. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 37Greenberg S. Khoury J.E. Virgilio F.D. Kaplan E. Silverstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In apparent contrast, other investigations have found that there is a significant reduction in the phagocytic index in cells in which [Ca2+]i is highly buffered (38Young J.-E. Ko S. Cohn Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5430-5434Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 39Hishikawa T. Cheung J. Yelamarty R. Knutson D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A possible resolution to the contradictory findings came from studies suggesting that perhaps two pathways mediating phagocytosis might co-exist in the same cell, a Ca2+-dependent mechanism triggered by ligation of Fc receptors and a Ca2+-independent mechanism triggered by activation of C3b/bi receptors (40Lew D.P. Andersson T. Hed J. Di Virgilio F. Pozzan T. Stendahl O. Nature. 1985; 315: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although the possibility of multiple signal transduction pathways controlling phagocytosis might be present in a single cell, it did not resolve questions of regional distribution in [Ca2+]i in the stimulated versusunstimulated cell. Subcellular localization studies of [Ca2+]i transients subsequently demonstrated that neutrophils ingesting opsonized zymosan particles had the highest level of [Ca2+]i in the periphagosomal cytoplasm and that most of the increase in Ca2+ was obtained from external sources (41Sawyer D. Sullivan J. Mandell G. Science. 1985; 230: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The localization of the obligate increase in [Ca2+]i after FcRγ ligation appeared to be orchestrated by the remolding of the filamentous actin cytoskeleton, which reorganized in the early stages of the developing phagosome. During this process of cellular remodeling, Ca2+ storage organelles appear to undergo spatial reorganization and accumulate in the area around the ingested particle (42Stendahl O. Krause K.-H. Krischer J. Jerström P. Theler J.-M. Clark R.A. Carpentier J.-L. Lew D.P. Science. 1994; 265: 1439-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), giving rise to highly localized changes in intracellular Ca2+. It may be this highly localized transient increase in [Ca2+]ithat not only mobilizes cytoplasmic granules into the area surrounding the nascent phagosome but that also enhances their fusion with the phagosomal/plasma membrane in the presence of activated G proteins. In our studies, a rapid secretory phase in the capacitance record precedes the phagocytic uptake of the multivalent HAIGG. Our capacitance observations are consistent with the studies of Bajno et al.(31Bajno L. Peng X.-R. Schreiber A. Moore H.-P. Trimble W. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), who were able to demonstrate focal exocytosis of endosomal vesicles at sites of phagosome formation.Regulation of Exocytosis by [Ca2+]i and Activation of G ProteinAs with the mast cell (6Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 395: 193-214Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar), our data demonstrate that an increase in [Ca2+]i in the absence of G protein activation is not sufficient for secretion after stimulation with HAIGG. In contrast to the mast cell, however, exocytosis in macrophages can result from activating more G proteins or from elevating [Ca2+]i at resting levels of G protein activation. Calcium increases the amplitude and decreases the time course of the secretory response in a dose-dependent manner after stimulation with HAIGG. The fact that calcium-dependent increases in the secretory response can be further stimulated in the presence of saturating concentrations of GTPγS suggests that the two signaling elements, activated G proteins and [Ca2+]i, control secretion in an additive, two-step process. This is further emphasized by the fact that the amplitude and the kinetics of the HAIGG-induced secretory response is dramatically different in the presence and absence of BAPTA (see Fig.3). Thus, it is to be concluded that both G protein activation and increases in [Ca2+]i are essential for an optimal exocytotic response.A Model for the Exocytosis Regulated by G Protein and [Ca2+]i in MacrophageOur data support a model where the calcium lowers the threshold of a GTP-dependent process in the control of stimulus-induced secretion in the macrophage (see Fig. 6B). Treatment of the cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 induced marked secretion. GDPβS blocks this effect, indicating that activated G proteins are necessary for the secretory response. Fig.8 depicts a two-step model in which a Ca2+-dependent translocation step enhances the relocation of vesicles from a reserve pool to docked sites at the membrane. The docked vesicles eventually fuse with the plasma membrane in a G protein-dependent step. Activated G proteins appear to be much less effective in moving vesicles from the reserve pool. This model predicts, as was observed in our study, that Ca2+-dependent transport of vesicles from the reserve pool is rate-limiting in the secretory response. Once the reserve pool has been translocated to a membrane-docked site at saturating [Ca2+]i, the rate of release is rapid and no longer dependent upon further elevation in the GTPγS concentration. Furthermore, the model predicts that at saturating GTP concentrations the rate of release should be [Ca2+]i-dependent, reflecting the rate of calcium-dependent vesicle migration from the reserve pool, as was observed in Fig. 6A. And finally, the model predicts that the calcium-dependent step should be upstream of the GTP-dependent step controlling the rate of vesicle supply to the pool of docked granules. Thus, GTP should not alter the Kd of the Ca2+ dependence, as was observed in Fig. 6A. [Ca2+]i, however, [Ca2+]i strongly influenced theKd of the GTP dependence, as was observed in Fig.6B, presumably augmenting the number of vesicles available for fusion. Further experimental evidence for a GTP-mediated fusion step comes from data in which transient fusion events were observed without external stimulus in BAPTA-buffered internal solutions and high concentrations of GTPγS (see the inset in Fig. 8).The molecular processes that control docking and fusion of secretory granules in the phagocyte appear to involve interactions between elements of the SNARE complex, which comprise the cellular fusion machinery mediating membrane trafficking and neurotransmitter release in neuroendocrine cells. Isoforms of vesicle-associated membrane proteins, VAMPs, are involved in the recognition of target or t-SNARE proteins associated with the plasma membrane in the docking process. Hackam et al. (43Hackam D. Rotstein O. Sjolin C. Schreiber A. Trimble W. Grinstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11691-11696Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) were the first to describe the presence of VAMP-2 in J774 cells, where it associated with an apparent vesicular compartment. Those molecules, which are recognized by the VAMP proteins on the plasma membrane, are termed t-SNARES. Isoform-specific antibodies have been used to delineate the subcellular distribution of t-SNARE proteins in macrophages. The syntaxins are a subset of the specific t-SNARE-docking proteins thought to control vesicle fusion. Hackam et al. (44Hackam D. Rotstein O. Bennett M. Klip A. Grinstein S. Manolson M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4377-4383PubMed Google Scholar) use confocal microscopy to demonstrate that syntaxin 2, 3, and 4 were present not only on the plasma membrane of human and murine macrophages but on intracellular vesicles as well. Although not demonstrated, it is possible that the syntaxins play a role in targeting as well as fusion in the macrophage in the exocytotic release of granular contents into the extracellular compartment. The observation that SNARE proteins also contribute to Ca2+cooperativity of synaptic transmission (45Stewart B.A. Mohtashami M. Trimble W.S. Boulianne G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13955-13960Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) suggests that SNARE proteins may be one of the integrative factors by which Ca2+ and activated G proteins synergistically regulate the exocytosis in the activated macrophage. The class of phagocytic inflammatory cells encompasses the mononuclear phagocytes, including circulating monocytes, tissue macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils. The macrophage is the primary differentiated cell of this system and plays a major role in host defense against microbial infections. Macrophages possess a diversity of plasma membrane receptors that recognize and bind both particulate and soluble stimuli found in body fluids.

When Fcγ receptors are engaged at the cell surface by the opsonized surface of interacting particles, the resultant receptor clustering initiates tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic residues in the immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs by Src-family kinases. The resultant tyrosine-phosphorylated residues form anchoring sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins, the most important of which seems to the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Syk, which can phosphorylate several downstream substrates involved in the phagocytic response. One such substrate is the Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav, which activates the small G proteins Rac and Cdc42.

Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 232: 15-48PubMed Google Scholar, 2Groettrup M. Soza A. Kuckelkorn U. Kloetzel P.-M. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 429-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) are then translocated via peptide-specific transporters (transporter associated with antigen processing) into the endoplasmic reticulum where they assemble with the MHC class I molecules and are eventually subjected to further trimming (3Elliott T.

In contrast to the well studied processing pathway of peptides derived from cytosolic proteins, very little is known about the ability of glycopeptides originating from viral glycoproteins to successfully pass through the above mentioned steps.

However, given the failure to identify naturally processedN-glycopeptides as epitopes to date, the fate of viral glycopeptides as MHC class I-restricted antigens remains very unclear.

The presence of glycopeptides derived from the LCMV glycoproteins bearing the H-2Db binding motif makes LCMV infection a model of choice to study the fate of glycopeptides as CTL epitopes. We recently showed that the LCMV GP92–101 subdominant epitope (CSANNSHHYI), which bears the glycosylation motif NNS within its sequence, was post-translationally modified in infected cells and presented at the cell surface by H-2Db molecules in two different forms, a nonglycosylated form (CSANNSHHYI) and a de-N-glycosylated form (CSADNSHHYI) resulting from the N-glycanase-mediated de-N-glycosylation of a previously N-glycosylated peptide sequence (16Hudrisier D. Riond J. Mazarguil H. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36274-36280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). An additional H-2Db-restricted glycopeptide GP392–400 (WLVTNGSYL) was previously identified in the LCMV GP2 protein (25Hudrisier D. Mazarguil H. Laval F. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17829-17836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It shares similar biochemical properties with GP92–101. Like GP92–101, GP392–400: (i) bears a NXS glycosylation motif, (ii) is N-glycosylated in the mature LCMV GP2 glycoprotein (27Wright K.E. Spiro R.C. Burns J.W. Buchmeier M.J. Virology. 1990; 177: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and (iii) binds efficiently to H-2Db (25Hudrisier D. Mazarguil H. Laval F. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17829-17836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28Oldstone M.B.A. Lewicki H. Borrow P. Hudrisier D. Gairin J.E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to GP92–101, no CTL response against GP392–400 has been detected (28Oldstone M.B.A. Lewicki H. Borrow P. Hudrisier D. Gairin J.E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its cellular status remains unknown. The contrasting immunogenic properties of GP92–101 and GP392–400 suggest that the common biochemical events or intracellular mechanisms encountered by these two viral glycopeptides along the processing and presentation pathway lead to different fates as MHC class I-restricted CTL epitopes. This would not have been predicted on the basis of their biochemical properties. The aim of our study was therefore to explore and dissect the intracellular molecular mechanisms that may differentially affect the processing pathways of these two viral glycopeptides and explain their different antigenic properties. CTL were obtained from C57BL/6 mice immunized subcutaneously at the base of the tail with 50–100 μg of the indicated peptides mixed with 5 μg of P30 T-helper epitope from tetanus toxoid in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. After 1 week, draining lymph nodes were removed, and CTL were restimulated at weekly intervals with irradiated (2,500 rads) C57BL/6 splenocytes and irradiated (10,000 rads) peptide-pulsed (1 μm) RMA cells in the presence of 30 IU/ml interleukin-2 (EL4 supernatant). Murine H-2b mutant RMA-S cells were used in binding experiments. The murine H-2b cell lines RMA and MC57 were used inin vitro cytotoxicity assays. The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (RMA, RMA-S, and MC57) containing 5% bovine serum, l-glutamine (2 mm), and antibiotics (10 units/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin). The LCMV Armstrong strain (LCMV Arm) was used to infect mice or cells. The peptides were synthesized by the solid phase method using Fmoc chemistry. For Asn-glycosylated peptides, Fmoc-Asn(Ac3AcNH-βGlc)-OH, a commercially available derivative of Asn bearing GlcNAc (Novabiochem) was used. After standard protocols for solid phase synthesis, cleavage, and deprotection, the glycopeptide was de-O-acetylated with 0.1m sodium hydroxide as described previously (16Hudrisier D. Riond J. Mazarguil H. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36274-36280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The peptides were purified by HPLC on a RP300-C8 reversed phase column (Brownlee Lab), and their identities were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. RMA or MC57 cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in medium containing 10-fold dilutions of peptides. MC57 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 2 with LCMV Arm 48 h prior to the assay. RMA (peptide-pulsed or not) or MC57 (LCMV-infected or not) cells were51Cr-labeled and used as targets (5 × 103/well) in chromium release assays. CTL (1.5 × 104/well or at the indicated E/T ratio) were added, and after 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the 51Cr content of supernatants was determined. The specific lysis was calculated as 100 × [(experimental − spontaneous release)/(total − spontaneous release)]. The binding studies were performed as described previously (25Hudrisier D.

Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, RMA-S cells (5 × 105 cells/well) previously incubated at 26 °C for 40 h were placed in U-bottomed 96-well plates for 4 h at 37 °C with increasing concentrations (0–10−4m) of unlabeled peptides. The cells were then washed twice with BSA/PBS and incubated at 4 °C for 45 min. with the 28–14-8S anti-H-2Db monoclonal antibody (hybridoma supernatant) (30Ozato K. Hansen T.H. Sachs D.H. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 2473-2477PubMed Google Scholar). After two washes in BSA/PBS, an anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) was added for 45 min. Then the cells were washed twice in BSA/PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. The peptides were extracted from the surface of LCMV-infected MC57 (H-2b) cells as described previously (16Hudrisier D. Riond J. Mazarguil H. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36274-36280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (1–2 × 109) were washed in PBS and then resuspended in 0.1 m citrate/phosphate buffer at pH 3.0 for 2 min. The eluted material was desalted on a SepPak column, transferred onto a Centricon 10, and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Material less than 10 kDa was vacuum concentrated then resuspended in 20 μl of 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were separated by HPLC (Waters 600S controller system) on a reversed phase C18 column (7 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm, Aquapore, BrownleeTM) according to the following procedure: solution A, 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O; solution B, 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN; a 60-min gradient, 5–60% B; flow rate: 400 μl/min. The fractions (200 μl) were collected in U-bottomed 96-well plates, lyophilized, reconstituted in PBS, and stored at −80 °C before analysis. The three-dimensional models for LCMV GP92–101 (CSANNSHHYI) and LCMV GP392–400 (WLVTNGSYL) interacting with H-2Db have been produced using the online modeling facility SwissModel (GlaxoWellcome) at the following address: www.expasy.ch/spdbv/. Peptides bearing aN-glycosylation motif NX(S/T) can theoretically exist in three different forms: a nonglycosylated one bearing an unmodified NX(S/T) sequence, a N-glycosylated one in which a glycan moiety is attached to Asn, and a de-N-glycosylated one resulting in the conversion of Asn to Asp. To analyze their fate as CTL epitopes, we synthesized peptides corresponding to the nonglycosylated (genetically encoded),N-glycosylated, and de-N-glycosylated forms of LCMV GP392–400 (named GP392–400, [GlcNAc-N396]-GP392–400, and [D396]-GP392–400 respectively), and of LCMV GP92–101 (named GP92–101, [GlcNAc-N95]-GP92–101, and [D95]-GP92–101 respectively). The N-acetyl-d-glucosamine moiety was chosen to mimic the glycosylated form because it is the first carbohydrate attached to Asn and common to all eukaryotic glycosylation processes. Previous studies have failed to reveal a response to LCMV GP392–400 following LCMV infection of mice (28Oldstone M.B.A. Lewicki H. Borrow P. Hudrisier D. Gairin J.E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but in these studies the fact that GP392–400 bears a N-glycan in the mature viral protein was not taken into account. Our first aim was therefore to analyze the ability of the different unmodified (GP392–400) and post-translationally modified ([GlcNAc-N396]-GP392–400 and [D396]-GP392–400) forms of LCMV GP392–400 to generate a CTL response upon immunization. After several rounds of in vitrorestimulation, CTL from peptide-immunized B6 mice were obtained against the GP392–400 form but not against the [GlcNAc-N396]-GP392–400 and [D396]-GP392–400 forms. This indicated that only GP392–400 was immunogenic, a result that contrasted with those obtained with LCMV GP92–101, where all three forms (GP92–101, [GlcNAc-N95]-GP92–101, and [D95]-GP92–101) were found to be immunogenic under the same experimental conditions (16Hudrisier D. Riond J. Mazarguil H. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36274-36280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, anti-GP392–400 CTL specifically recognized the H-2b RMA (panel A) or MC57 (panel B) cells pulsed with GP392–400, in an effector:target (E:T) ratio-dependent manner. Unpulsed targets were not lysed (RMA) or were lysed weakly at the highest E:T ratios (MC57). A CTL clone was then derived from the LCMV GP392–400-specific CTL line by limiting dilution. We tested the ability of these CTL to kill target cells coated with the immunizing peptide GP392–400 or its post-translationally modified forms [GlcNAc-N396]-GP392–400 or [D396]-GP392–400. Both the CTL line (Fig.2A) and the CTL clone (Fig.2B) recognized and lysed GP392–400-pulsed target cells with comparable efficacy (half-maximal lysis in the pm range). In contrast, 3–4-log higher concentrations of [GlcNAc-N396]-GP392–400 or of [D396]-GP392–400 (half-maximal lysis in the 10−9–10−8m range) were required to obtain the same lysis by both the CTL line and the clone. In a comparative analysis shown in Fig. 2C, LCMV GP92–101-specific CTL generated against the GP92–101 peptide recognized the [D95]-GP92–101 form more efficiently than the GP92–101 form used for the immunization (half-maximal lysis at 10−12 and 10−10m, respectively). Higher concentrations of [GlcNAc-N95]-GP92–101 (half-maximal lysis in the 10−8m range, comparable with that of [GlcNAc-N396]-GP392–400 by anti-GP392–400 specific CTL) were necessary to sensitize target cells to CTL killing, confirming previous results (16Hudrisier D. Riond J. Mazarguil H. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36274-36280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because one of the factors determining the immunogenicity of peptides is their ability to be presented by MHC class-I molecules (31vandenBurg S.H. Visseren M.J.W. Brandt R.M.P. Kast W.M. Melief C.J.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3308-3314PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hudrisier D. Riond J. Gairin J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2468-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that post-translational modifications could differentially affect the MHC class I presentation and could result in different immunogenic properties of the LCMV viral glycopeptides. Peptide binding to H-2Db was measured in a previously described MHC stabilization assay on RMA-S cells (25Hudrisier D. Mazarguil H. Laval F. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17829-17836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Hudrisier D. Mazarguil H. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3A, GP392–400 bound efficiently to H-2Db (half-maximal binding in the 0.1–0.2 μm range), in agreement with previous observations (25Hudrisier D. Mazarguil H. Laval F. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17829-17836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast binding of the two modified analogs to H-2Dbwas strongly reduced; [D396]-GP392–400 showed a 2-log decrease in H-2Db binding properties (half-maximal binding at 10 μm). Half-maximal binding was even not measurable for [GlcNAc-N396]-GP392–400 (only ∼25% maximal binding was observed at the highest concentration tested (10−4m)). Deficiency in MHC binding of these two peptides is therefore likely one of the reasons that may explain their lack of immunogenicity. A different situation was observed with the LCMV GP92–101 subdominant antigen for which the three forms bound efficiently to H-2Db (Fig. 3B). GP92–101 and [D95]-GP92–101 showed superimposed curves (half-maximal binding at <0.1 μm), whereas the [GlcNAc-N395]-GP92–101 form exhibited a 1-log higher binding (half-maximal binding at <0.01 μm). The differences in the efficiency with which they are recognized by CTL may thus likely reflect differences in TCR recognition rather than MHC binding (16Hudrisier D. Riond J. Mazarguil H. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36274-36280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It can be deduced from the experiments presented above that only the Asn396 form of GP392–400 is likely to be presented by H-2Db at the surface of infected cells, whereas all three forms of GP92–101 could be presented. The cytolytic activity of the anti-GP392–400 CTL was thus tested against LCMV-infected or uninfected MC57 target cells. Fig.4 shows that neither the CTL line (panel A) nor the CTL clone (panel B) generated against GP392–400 were able to kill LCMV-infected cells, even at the highest E:T ratio tested. In comparison (panel C), efficient killing was observed when the CTL line generated against the unmodified form of the subdominant LCMV epitope GP92–101 was used, in accord with a previous study (16Hudrisier D. Riond J. Mazarguil H. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36274-36280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Further, when HPLC-fractionated material eluted from the surface of LCMV-infected MC57 cells was used to pulse uninfected targets, no lysis by anti-GP392–400 CTL was observed (Fig.5B). This observation contrasted that made with cells coated with mock-extracted synthetic GP392–400 peptide (Fig. 5A) and results obtained with anti-GP92–101 CTL directed against cells pulsed with the same pool of peptides extracted from LCMV-infected MC57 cells (16Hudrisier D.

Because a very low number of copies (100 or less) of an antigenic peptide present at the cell surface is sufficient to trigger CTL lysis, we can conclude from these results that GP392–400 is not naturally presented at the surface of LCMV-infected cells. This observation contrasts with that made with LCMV GP92–101 for which we found that both the genetically encoded GP92–101 and post-translationally modified [D95]-GP92–101 forms were co-presented to CTL at the surface of LCMV-infected cells, whereas the N-glycosylated form [GlcNAc-N95]-GP92–101 was absent (16Hudrisier D.

We previously reported that synthetic peptides corresponding to the unmodified (genetically encoded),N-glycosylated or de-N-glycosylated analogs of GP92–101 share the ability to bind strongly to H-2Db, are both immunogenic, and are naturally processed and presented at the surface of infected cells (16Hudrisier D.

We now show that post-translational modifications of so called “high affinity peptides” do not always have a positive effect on the diversity of antigen presentation. The results presented in this paper show that N-glycosylation or de-N-glycosylation of GP392–400 led to peptides with reduced MHC binding properties at physiological concentrations, whereas unmodified GP392–400 efficiently bound to this molecule. This may be one of the reasons why only the unmodified form of GP392–400 is immunogenic in C56BL/6 mice and could generate epitope-specific CTL that efficiently lysed peptide-pulsed target cells. However GP392–400-specific CTL did not recognize LCMV-infected cells, showing that GP392–400 is not presented by H-2Db in a natural situation. The lack of presentation of the [GlcNAc-N396]-GP392–400 and [D396]-GP392–400 forms can be easily explained by our observation that those peptides are poor H-2Db binders and show no immunogenicity. Indeed above a certain threshold of binding to the MHC, the immunogenicity of peptides rapidly drops, preventing these peptides from acting as T cell epitopes (33Barber L.D. Parham P. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1191-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). That LCMV-infected cells were not recognized by anti-GP392–400 CTL tells us that not only [GlcNAc-N396]-GP392–400 and [D396]-GP392–400 but also GP392–400, despite its high H-2Db binding properties, were absent from the infected cell surface.Table ISummary of the cellular, biochemical, and immunological properties of the different forms of the viral glycopeptides LCMV GP392–400 and GP92–101SequencePeptideCellular statusCTL epitopeH-2D1-bPeptides were considered as immunogenic or not when a CTL response was generated or not following injection of synthetic peptide as described under “Experimental Procedures.”binding1-aBinding was considered as efficient, moderate, or weak when measured half-maximal binding values were ≤1 μm, ≤100 μm, or >100 μm, respectively.Immunogenicity1-bPeptides were considered as immunogenic or not when a CTL response was generated or not following injection of synthetic peptide as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Presented by LCMV-infected cellsG"
