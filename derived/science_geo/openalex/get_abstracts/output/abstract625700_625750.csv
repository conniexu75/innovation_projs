https://openalex.org/W4231640017,"The machinery behind amyloid peptides β-Amyloid peptides, which are derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP), form the plaques in the brain that are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Zhou et al. report a high-resolution structure of a transmembrane segment of APP bound to human γ-secretase, the transmembrane protease that cleaves APP to give β-amyloid peptides (see the Perspective by Lichtenthaler and Güner). Disease-associated mutations within presenilin-1, the catalytic subunit of APP, likely affect how the substrate is bound and thus which peptides are generated, with some being more amyloidogenic. It may now be possible to exploit the features of substrate binding to design inhibitors. Science , this issue p. eaaw0930 ; see also p. 690"

Gopinadhan et al. engineered two-dimensional water channels by removing an atomic plane of atoms from a sandwich made from bulk crystal with a graphene spacer. Water flowed through the channels without resistance, but the channels excluded all ions except for protons because the ion hydration shells could not squeeze through the channels.

It is not straightforward to excise regular fragments in a top-down fashion to produce periodic gaps. Sun et al. showcase the beginnings of a bottom-up strategy toward this end. They used borylations and catalytic cross-coupling chemistry to prepare a discrete cylindrical carbon compound composed of 40 benzene rings bonded to one another at the 1, 3, and 5 positions to leave regular void spaces in the walls. Catenation of multiple similar segments could ultimately lead to an extended nanotube with periodic wall defects. Science , this issue p. 151"

In Study 1, we attempted to replicate Boutwell et al.’s findings using a more direct measure of discrimination. Using data from the Pew Research Center, we examined a large sample of American respondents (N = 3,716) and explored the prevalence of discrimination experiences among various racial groups. Our findings stand in contrast to Boutwell et al.’s estimates, revealing that between 50% and 75% of Black, Hispanic, and Asian respondents (depending on the group and analytic approach) reported discriminatory treatment. In Study 2, we explored whether question framing affected how participants responded to Boutwell’s question about experiencing less respect and courtesy. Regardless of question framing, non-White participants reported more experiences than White participants. Further, there was an interaction of participant race and question framing such that when participants were asked about experiences of less respect or courtesy broadly, there were no differences between non-White participants and White participants, but when they were asked about experiences that were specifically race-based, non-White participants reported more experiences than White participants. The current research provides a counterweight to the claim that discrimination is not a prevalent feature of the lives of minority groups and the serious implications this claim poses for research and public policy."

Weyl physics arises when the valence band and conduction bands meet at discrete points in the band structure. Jia et al. designed and fabricated a photonic metamaterial in which the position of the Weyl points in momentum space could be tuned using a huge artificial magnetic field. Because these points are stable, the ability to design and control such a Weyl system with a robust chiral optical mode could be exploited in future optical information processing applications.

https://openalex.org/W2908723002,"Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease γ-secretase is linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We report an atomic structure of human γ-secretase in complex with a transmembrane (TM) APP fragment at 2.6-angstrom resolution. The TM helix of APP closely interacts with five surrounding TMs of PS1 (the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase). A hybrid β sheet, which is formed by a β strand from APP and two β strands from PS1, guides γ-secretase to the scissile peptide bond of APP between its TM and β strand. Residues at the interface between PS1 and APP are heavily targeted by recurring mutations from AD patients. This structure, together with that of γ-secretase bound to Notch, reveal contrasting features of substrate binding, which may be applied toward the design of substrate-specific inhibitors."

Such memory traces are largely contributed by a selection of preconfigured neuronal patterns. However, when and how these preconfigured patterns first emerge in the hippocampus is unknown. Farooq and Dragoi identified an age-dependent development of network preconfiguration into trajectory-like sequences. This preconfiguration was expressed spontaneously during sleep and emerged from the assembly of persistent, location-depicting ensembles, largely controlled by intrinsic developmental programs. Thus, the compressed binding of adjacent locations into spatial trajectories during navigation and their experience-dependent replay emerge in coordination from spontaneous preconfigured sequences.

https://openalex.org/W2909270764,"Switching ON resistance Clonal bacterial colonies will often grow dissimilar patches, similar to a tortoiseshell pattern. These differing phenotypes arise by reversible mechanisms called phase variation. Jiang et al. developed an algorithm to survey bacterial genomes for invertible promoters that cause phase variation. Inverted repeats signal the presence of these promoters, which can flip between ON and OFF states catalyzed by phage integrase analogs called invertases. Invertible promoters linked to antibiotic resistance genes were widespread among vertebrate gut–associated organisms, including Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, and Verrucomicrobia. These bacteria are thus equipped and prepared for sudden environmental stress, including antibiotic exposure. Science , this issue p. 181"
https://openalex.org/W2909114367,"Unmasking an agent of inflammatory anemia Infectious and autoimmune diseases are associated with anemia and thrombocytopenia. A severe form of inflammatory cytopenia called macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) may occur during rheumatological disorders and viral infections. Akilesh et al. show that monocyte recognition of self- or pathogen-derived nucleic acids via Toll-like receptors 7 and 9 (TLR7 and TLR9) drives MAS-like disease in mice. TLR7 or TLR9 signaling in monocytes causes these cells to differentiate into inflammatory hematophagocytes (iHPCs), which are similar to but distinct from red pulp macrophages. Preventing iHPC differentiation by depleting monocytes relieves MAS-like symptoms. When mice were subjected to a model of malarial anemia, MyD88- and endosomal TLR-dependent iHPC differentiation also occurred. Thus, iHPCs may play a role in both MAS-driven and malarial anemia, as well as thrombocytopenia. Science , this issue p. eaao5213"
https://openalex.org/W2908605292,"TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a nucleic acid–binding protein, and its aggregation represents the defining pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and related proteinopathies. Recent studies implicate cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) as hubs that may facilitate TDP-43 aggregation. Here, using cellular fractionation, biochemical analyses, and histological assays, we show that TDP-43 targeted to the cytoplasm has multiple fates. Whereas a TDP-43 subpopulation is indeed recruited to SGs, mature aggregated TDP-43, produced with aggregate-prone TDP-43 variants or exposure to oxidative stress, generates distinct TDP-43 inclusions that are surprisingly devoid of SGs. Consistent with this observation, we found that SG components are predominantly excluded from TDP-43 pathology in motor neurons from individuals with ALS. We generated de novo SGs by expressing the fragile X protein (FMRP) and found that rather than directly engaging TDP-43 aggregates, SGs can sequester the proteostasis factor histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and thereby impede TDP-43 clearance from cells. These findings indicate that SGs form distinct cytoplasmic structures that can indirectly enhance TDP-43 aggregation. Therapeutic approaches that inhibit SG formation may therefore be effective at suppressing TDP-43–mediated toxicity in patients with ALS and related TDP-43 proteinopathies."

When the two types of molecules are mixed, they tend to phase separate. Yano et al. found the right recipe that allowed enough affinity between the disks and rods so that they formed a blended twisted columnar phase. The phase could be stabilized by polymerizing the disks. The orientation of the twisted columns could be altered using electric fields, whereas optical stimuli could lead to a second ordering transition. Science , this issue p. 161"

https://openalex.org/W2910457294,"Background Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are one of the leading causes of child mortality worldwide and contribute significant health burden for developing nations such as Bangladesh. Seeking care and prompt management is crucial to reduce disease severity and to prevent associated morbidity and mortality. Objective This study investigated the prevalence and care-seeking behaviors among under-five children in Bangladesh and identified factors associated with ARI prevalence and subsequent care-seeking behaviors. Method The present study analyzed cross-sectional data from the 2014 Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey. Bivariate analysis was performed to estimate the prevalence of ARIs and associated care-seeking. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the influencing socio-economic and demographic predictors. A p-value of <0.05 was considered as the level of significance. Result Among 6,566 under-five children, 5.42% had experienced ARI symptoms, care being sought for 90% of affected children. Prevalence was significantly higher among children < 2 years old, and among males. Children from poorer and the poorest quintiles of households were 2.40 (95% CI = 1.12, 5.15) and 2.36 (95% CI = 1.06, 5.24) times more likely to suffer from ARIs compared to the wealthiest group. Seeking care was significantly higher among female children (AOR = 2.19, 95% CI = 0.94, 5.12). The likelihood of seeking care was less for children belonging to the poorest quintile compared to the richest (AOR = 0.03, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.55). Seeking care from untrained providers was 3.74 more likely among rural residents compared to urban (RRR = 3.74, 95% CI = 1.10, 12.77). Conclusion ARIs continue to contribute high disease burden among under-five children in Bangladesh lacking of appropriate care-seeking behavior. Various factors, such as age and sex of the children, wealth index, the education of the mother, and household lifestyle factors were significantly associated with ARI prevalence and care-seeking behaviors. In addition to public-private actions to increase service accessibility for poorer households, equitable and efficient service distribution and interventions targeting households with low socio-economic status and lower education level, are recommended."

https://openalex.org/W2908962914,"Selective inhibition of BCL-2 is expected to enhance therapeutic vulnerability in luminal estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers. We show here that the BCL-2 dependency of luminal tumor cells is nevertheless mitigated by breast cancer-associated fibroblasts (bCAFs) in a manner that defines MCL-1 as another critical therapeutic target. bCAFs favor MCL-1 expression and apoptotic resistance in luminal cancer cells in a IL-6 dependent manner while their own, robust, survival also relies on MCL-1. Studies based on ex vivo cultures of human luminal breast cancer tissues further argue that the contribution of stroma-derived signals to MCL-1 expression shapes BCL-2 dependency. Thus, MCL-1 inhibitors are beneficial for targeted apoptosis of breast tumor ecosystems, even in a subtype where MCL-1 dependency is not intrinsically driven by oncogenic pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2909858700,"Recently, our group demonstrated that immobilized VEGF can capture flowing endothelial cells (ECs) from the blood in vitro and promote endothelialization and patency of acellular tissue-engineered vessels (A-TEVs) into the arterial system of an ovine animal model. Here, we demonstrate implantability of submillimeter diameter heparin and VEGF-decorated A-TEVs in a mouse model and discuss the cellular and immunologic response. At 1 mo postimplantation, the graft lumen was fully endothelialized, as shown by expression of EC markers such as CD144, eNOS, CD31, and VEGFR2. Interestingly, the same cells coexpressed leukocyte/macrophage (Mϕ) markers CD14, CD16, VEGFR1, CD38, and EGR2. Notably, there was a stark difference in the cellular makeup between grafts containing VEGF and those containing heparin alone. In VEGF-containing grafts, infiltrating monocytes (MCs) converted into anti-inflammatory M2-Mϕs, and the grafts developed well-demarcated luminal and medial layers resembling those of native arteries. In contrast, in grafts containing only heparin, MCs converted primarily into M1-Mϕs, and the endothelial and smooth muscle layers were not well defined. Our results indicate that VEGF may play an important role in regulating A-TEV patency and regeneration, possibly by regulating the inflammatory response to the implants.-Smith, R.

https://openalex.org/W2910047409,"A novel CAD scheme for automated lung nodule detection is proposed to assist radiologists with the detection of lung cancer on CT scans. The proposed scheme is composed of four major steps: (1) lung volume segmentation, (2) nodule candidate extraction and grouping, (3) false positives reduction for the non-vessel tree group, and (4) classification for the vessel tree group. Lung segmentation is performed first. Then, 3D labeling technology is used to divide nodule candidates into two groups. For the non-vessel tree group, nodule candidates are classified as true nodules at the false positive reduction stage if the candidates survive the rule-based classifier and are not screened out by the dot filter. For the vessel tree group, nodule candidates are extracted using dot filter. Next, RSFS feature selection is used to select the most discriminating features for classification. Finally, WSVM with an undersampling approach is adopted to discriminate true nodules from vessel bifurcations in vessel tree group. The proposed method was evaluated on 154 thin-slice scans with 204 nodules in the LIDC database. The performance of the proposed CAD scheme yielded a high sensitivity (87.81%) while maintaining a low false rate (1.057 FPs/scan). The experimental results indicate the performance of our method may be better than the existing methods."

https://openalex.org/W2909661552,"Flotillin-1 (Flot-1) has been shown to regulate cancer progression, but the regulatory role of post-translational modifications of Flot-1 on cancers remains elusive. Herein, we show that up-regulated E2 conjugating enzyme UBC9 sumoylates Flot-1 at Lys-51 and Lys-195 with small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-2/3 modification in metastatic prostate cancer. Mitogen induced the sumoylation and nuclear translocation of Flot-1. The nuclear-targeted Flot-1 physically interacted with Snail, and inhibited Snail degradation through the proteasome in a sumoylation-dependent manner, thereby promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Sumoylation of Flot-1 by up-regulated UBC9 in human metastatic prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer cells with high metastatic potential positively correlated with the stabilization of Snail and the induction of Snail-mediated EMT genes in the metastatic prostate cancer. Our study reveals a new mechanism of sumoylated Flot-1-mediating Snail stabilization, and identifies a novel sumoylated Flot-1-Snail signaling axis in EMT of metastatic prostate cancer."

Tyrosine aminotransferases (TATs) catalyze the reversible reaction between Tyr and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP), representing the entry point in plants for both biosynthesis of various natural products and Tyr degradation in the recycling of energy and nutrients. To better understand the roles of TATs and how Tyr is metabolized in planta, here we characterized single and double loss-of-function mutants of TAT1 (At5g53970) and TAT2 (At5g36160) in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. As reported previously, tat1 mutants exhibited elevated and decreased levels of Tyr and tocopherols, respectively. The tat2 mutation alone had no impact on Tyr and tocopherol levels, but a tat1 tat2 double mutant had increased Tyr accumulation and decreased tocopherol levels under high-light stress compared with the tat1 mutant. Relative to WT and the tat2 mutant, the tat1 mutant displayed increased vulnerability to continuous dark treatment, associated with an early drop in respiratory activity and sucrose depletion. During isotope-labeled Tyr feeding in the dark, we observed that the tat1 mutant exhibits much slower 13C incorporation into tocopherols, fumarate, and other tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates than WT and the tat2 mutant. These results indicate that TAT1 and TAT2 function together in tocopherol biosynthesis, with TAT2 having a lesser role, and that TAT1 plays the major role in Tyr degradation in planta.

The removal of the amino group of Tyr is the committed step of Tyr degradation and some Tyr metabolic pathways (Fig. 1).

Current knowledge of the Tyr degradation pathway is mainly based on knowledge from microbes and mammals (Fig. 1); Tyr is first converted to HPP by TAT and then to homogentisate by HPP dioxygenase (HPPD). Homogentisate is further converted to maleylacetoacetate and fumarylacetoacetate by homogentisate oxidase (HGO) and maleylacetoacetate isomerase (MAAI), respectively. Finally, fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) converts fumarylacetoacetate into acetoacetate and fumarate, which enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (34Phornphutkul C. Introne W.J. Perry M.B.

Thus, the major degradation pathway of Tyr is likely located in the cytosol (Fig. 1), although some upstream reactions may redundantly operate in the plastids, depending on plant species (45Wang M.

The FAH mutants of Arabidopsis show a short-day-sensitive-cell-death (sscd) phenotype, which can be recovered by simultaneously knocking out the upstream HGO, likely due to elimination of the accumulation of a toxic succinylacetoacetate derived from fumarylacetoacetate (48Han C.

In plants, homogentisate, an intermediate of the Tyr degradation pathway, is also used for synthesis of tocochromanols and plastoquinone (49DellaPenna D. Pogson B.J.

In Arabidopsis, HPPD knockdown mutant showed an albino phenotype due to reduced level of plastoquinone, whereas HPPD overexpression resulted in elevated accumulation of tocopherols (50Norris S.R.

Early feeding experiments of spinach chloroplasts indicated that [14C]homogentisate is incorporated into tocopherols and plastoquinone as efficiently as [14C]Tyr or [14C]HPP (52Whistance G.R.

However, it is not fully understood how TATs contribute to the Tyr degradation pathway in planta. Virus-induced silencing of TAT in Papaver somniferum led to reduction in the levels of isoquinoline alkaloids derived from both HPP and Tyr (53Lee E.-J. Facchini P.J.

The TAT1 enzyme prefers Tyr as an amino donor substrate, has a low Km toward Tyr, and favors Tyr deamination to form HPP rather than the reverse reaction. TAT1 had relatively broad keto acid acceptor specificity, and the amino group of Tyr could be transferred to α-ketoglutarate, phenylpyruvate, and, to a lesser extent, 4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoate, which are then converted to glutamate, phenylalanine, and methionine, respectively (45Wang M.

Knocking out TAT1 does not induce visible phenotype under normal conditions but led to a decrease in tocopherol levels, indicating that TAT1 is involved in the biosynthesis of tocopherols (55Riewe D.

The TAT2 enzyme, on the other hand, has a broad substrate specificity and a relatively high Km toward Tyr and prefers HPP transamination to Tyr (45Wang M. Toda K. Maeda H.A.

Here, we established an experimental system using circular arrays of positioned nucleosomes to investigate whether variations in nucleosome linker length could affect nucleosome folding, self-association, and interactions. We conducted EM, DNA topology, native electrophoretic assays, and Mg2+-dependent self-association assays to study intrinsic folding of linear and circular nucleosome arrays with linker DNA length of 36 bp and 41 bp (3.5 turns and 4 turns of DNA double helix, respectively). These experiments revealed that potential artifacts arising from open DNA ends and full DNA relaxation in the linear arrays do not significantly affect overall chromatin compaction and self-association. We observed that the 0.5 DNA helical turn difference between the two DNA linker lengths significantly affects DNA topology and nucleosome interactions. In particular, the 41-bp linkers promoted interactions between any two nucleosome beads separated by one bead as expected for a zigzag fiber, whereas the 36-bp linkers promoted interactions between two nucleosome beads separated by two other beads and also reduced negative superhelicity. Monte Carlo simulations accurately reproduce periodic modulations of chromatin compaction, DNA topology, and internucleosomal interactions with a 10-bp periodicity. We propose that the nucleosome spacing and associated chromatin structure modulations may play an important role in formation of different chromatin epigenetic states, thus suggesting implications for how chromatin accessibility to DNA-binding factors and the RNA transcription machinery is regulated.

We propose that the nucleosome spacing and associated chromatin structure modulations may play an important role in formation of different chromatin epigenetic states, thus suggesting implications for how chromatin accessibility to DNA-binding factors and the RNA transcription machinery is regulated. Understanding the mechanisms by which eukaryotic DNA is tightly packed in the interphase chromatin and metaphase chromosomes and at the same time remains accessible to the biological machinery remains one of the most fundamental problems in cell biology. Most textbooks, based on structural studies of biochemically defined linear nucleosome arrays in vitro, describe chromatin folding as helical fibers, either the one-start solenoidal helix with bent DNA or the two-start helical zigzag with relatively straight linker DNA. However, recent evidence from in vivo and in situ studies suggests that regular helical structures are absent from nuclear chromatin and that in most proliferating cells the chromatin is highly irregular in situ without any distinct order above the nucleosome diameter (10 nm) (1Joti Y.

Within the same nucleus, the linker DNA length is preferentially quantized with ∼10-bp repeat (one DNA double helix turn) suggesting that it reflects steric features of chromatin folding (11Widom J.

Earlier biochemical experiments showed that the DNA linkers contain noninteger numbers of DNA turns, such as L = 5, 15, 25 bp (12Lohr D. The salt dependence of chicken and yeast chromatin structure.

Here, the type of DNA linkers with integer number of turns is denoted as {10n} and the linker lengths shifted by 5 bp as {10n+5}. Subsequent genome-wide mapping of yeast nucleosomes by parallel sequencing has also showed linker DNA distribution with peaks at {10n+5} bp (13Wang J.P. Fondufe-Mittendorf Y. Xi L. Tsai G.F. Segal E.

The highly variable nature of eukaryotic chromatin makes it necessary to create adequate in vitro and in silico models that could account for the complex and dynamic mechanism(s) and factors that mediate chromatin folding in vivo. Biochemically defined nucleosome arrays assembled from histone octamers and synthetic clone 601 nucleosome positioning DNA (19Lowary P.T. Widom J.

Using this system, an increase of linker DNA length from about 20 to 60 bp in ∼10-bp increments was shown to considerably alter chromatin fiber folding in vitro (20Robinson P.J. Fairall L. Huynh V.A.

Sedimentation and imaging analysis of clone 601–based nucleosome arrays with linker DNA lengths varying by small, 2- to 3-bp increments (24Correll S.J. Schubert M.H. Grigoryev S.A. Short nucleosome repeats impose rotational modulations on chromatin fibre folding.EMBO J. 2012; 31 (22473209): 2416-242610.1038/emboj.2012.80Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) allowed us to observe a periodic modulation of chromatin folding with strongest changes between the compact arrays with L = 20 {10n} and unfolded nucleosome chains with L = 25 bp {10n+5}. These experimental findings were consistent with later Monte Carlo simulations showing that 3D structure of the {10n+5} linkers precludes the nucleosomes from coming into close contact by their histone interfaces in contrast to the {10n} linkers (25Norouzi D. Zhurkin V.B. Topological polymorphism of the two-start chromatin fiber.Biophys.

Furthermore, linker DNA sequence–dependent bending was sufficient to significantly modulate nucleosome array folding (26Buckwalter J.M. Norouzi D. Harutyunyan A. Zhurkin V.B. Grigoryev S.A. Regulation of chromatin folding by conformational variations of nucleosome linker DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28934465): 9372-938710.1093/nar/gkx562Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Nuclear chromatin substantially differs from the linear arrays models by its ability to form topologically closed loops and thus to maintain different levels of DNA supercoiling. It also does not have free DNA ends and terminal nucleosomes that may promote unnatural end-to-end interactions in vitro. However, nucleosome arrays can be also assembled on circular covalently closed DNA forming circular nucleosome arrays in vitro and minichromosomes in vivo. Recently, using precisely positioned clone 601–based circular nucleosome arrays, we have conducted topological analysis showing that a 5-bp difference leading to rotational change of half turns between nucleosomes could strongly affect DNA topology in the circular arrays (27Nikitina T. Norouzi D. Grigoryev S.A. Zhurkin V.B. DNA topology in chromatin is defined by nucleosome spacing.Sci. Adv. 2017; 3 (29098179)e170095710.1126/sciadv.1700957Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This observation, based on analysis of relatively short 20- and 25-bp linkers typical for yeast genome, poses new questions: Whether the effect on DNA topology could be extended to larger DNA linkers such as those found in eukaryotic cells and whether the nucleosomes in topologically constrained circular nucleosome arrays would adopt a folded structure substantially different from those found in linear arrays. Guided by these questions, we constructed and studied linear and circular arrays containing 12-mer nucleosomes with 41- and 36-bp linker DNA corresponding to 188 and 183 nucleosome repeat lengths (NRLs) previously observed with human HeLa cell chromatin (28Compton J.L. Bellard M. Chambon P. Biochemical evidence of variability in the DNA repeat length in the chromatin of higher eukaryotes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73 (826906): 4382-438610.1073/pnas.73.12.4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 29Lohr D. Corden J. Tatchell K. Kovacic R.T. Van Holde K.E.

First, by analytical ultracentrifugation, agarose gel mobility, transmission EM, and DNA topology assays we observed that the NRL = 188 bp imposes a more compact chromatin folding of the linear arrays than the NRL = 183 bp arrays, thus showing that linker DNA length affects topology of a nucleosome array for NRLs typical of higher eukaryotes. These changes fall within the periodic structural modulations of nucleosome arrays with 20- and 25-bp linkers. Despite the substantial difference in DNA topology, the chromatin higher-order structure including salt-dependent chromatin compaction and self-association appeared to be rather similar and thus not affected by DNA topology and by the absence of open DNA ends in circular arrays. Remarkably, by EM-assisted Nucleosome Interaction Capture (EMANIC) we observed that the interactions between any two nucleosomes separated by one nucleosome (i ± 2) is notably stronger with NRL = 188 whereas interactions between any two nucleosomes separated by two other nucleosomes (i ± 3) is stronger with NRL = 183 in linear as well as in circular arrays. Our new computational model that combines multiple nucleosome rotational settings with dynamic opening of linker DNA was able to accurately recapitulate all experimentally observed properties of the positioned nucleosome arrays and extend experimental prediction for wide range of arrays (L = 20–60 bp) effectively covering nucleosome repeat length in most eukaryotic genomes. Based on our experiments and modeling, we suggest that the {10n} DNA linker length may play an important role in formation of folded chromatin fiber structures and DNA topology typical of heterochromatin, whereas {10n+5} linkers support the more flexible and amenable chromatin structures, thus providing new implications for regulation of chromatin accessibility to DNA binding factors and RNA transcription machinery. To investigate whether the difference in nucleosome spacing between 183- and 186-bp NRLs typical of higher vertebrates, in particular human HeLa cells (28Compton J.L. Bellard M. Chambon P. Biochemical evidence of variability in the DNA repeat length in the chromatin of higher eukaryotes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Proper histone/DNA ratios in the reconstituted linear arrays were monitored as we described previously (24Correll S.J. Schubert M.H. Grigoryev S.A. Short nucleosome repeats impose rotational modulations on chromatin fibre folding.EMBO J. 2012; 31 (22473209): 2416-242610.1038/emboj.2012.80Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Buckwalter J.M.

To monitor the extent of salt-dependent chromatin folding in the linear 183 × 12 and 188 × 12 arrays, we fixed the nucleosome arrays with 0.1% glutaraldehyde in a buffer containing either 5 or 150 mm NaCl. The fixed arrays were then subjected to deoxynucleoprotein (DNP) agarose gel electrophoresis. The agarose gel (Fig. 1A) shows that whereas at 5 mm NaCl the 183 × 12 and 188 × 12 arrays migrate with the same mobility (lanes 2, 3, 6, 7), at 150 mm NaCl the electrophoretic mobility of 188 × 12 is notably higher (Fig. 1B), consistent with its tighter compaction. Next, by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), we observed that at physiological salt concentration (150 mm NaCl) the 188 × 12 arrays undergo a more compact folding (s20,w0 = 42.0) than the NRL = 183-bp arrays (s20,w0 = 39.0) (Fig. 1, C–E). At low salt concentration (5 mm NaCl) no difference between the two arrays was observed (Fig. 1E) showing that the observed difference in sedimentation velocity is because of folding and not molecular mass or other difference in DNA or protein composition. The average of four AUC experiments indicated a statistically significant difference in sedimentation velocity between 183 × 12 and 188 × 12 at 150 mm NaCl (t test: p <0.001; Fig. 1E). A comparison with previous data (24Correll S.J. Schubert M.H. Grigoryev S.A. Short nucleosome repeats impose rotational modulations on chromatin fibre folding.EMBO J. 2012; 31 (22473209): 2416-242610.1038/emboj.2012.80Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) suggests that the changes in the salt-dependent nucleosome array compaction are periodically modulated in phase with periodic changes in linker DNA length in the NRL 165- to 188-bp range (Fig. 1F). Transmission EM (TEM) imaging was used to confirm results of DNP electrophoresis and AUC experiments. The 183 × 12 and 188 × 12 nucleosome arrays were fixed at 5 mm NaCl and 150 mm NaCl, attached to carbon-coated EM grids and imaged (Fig. 1H). At 5 mm NaCl, both 183 × 12 and 188 × 12 showed an open “beads on a string” conformation. At 150 mm NaCl, both arrays underwent a significant compaction with only a few nucleosomes protruding from the compacted chromatin fibers. To quantitate the linear compaction of the nucleosome arrays, we measured the number of nucleosomes per unit length for each construct (Fig. 1G). At low salt, the two constructs do not show significant differences in compaction. The increasing concentration of NaCl led to an ∼3-fold linear compaction and a notable difference between the 183 × 12 and 188 × 12 arrays. At 150 mm NaCl, the number of nucleosomes per 11 nm was significantly higher in 188 × 12 than in 183 × 12 arrays (t test: p <0.01). Thus, the TEM measurements confirm the 188 × 12 arrays undergo stronger longitudinal compaction at physiological ion conditions. Covalently closed circular DNA is characterized by the linking number (Lk) defined as the number of turns of one strand of the DNA double helix around the other (30Bauer W.R. Crick F.H. White J.H. Supercoiled DNA.Sci. Am. 1980; 243 (6256851): 100-113PubMed Google Scholar). Negative DNA supercoiling around histone octamer introduces Lk difference (ΔLk) between −1 and −1.5 depending on the linker DNA length (27Nikitina T. Norouzi D. Grigoryev S.A. Zhurkin V.B. DNA topology in chromatin is defined by nucleosome spacing.Sci. Adv. 2017; 3 (29098179)e170095710.1126/sciadv.1700957Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the longer nucleosome linkers typical of higher vertebrates (∼40 bp) could affect DNA linking number, we reconstituted circular nucleosome arrays using two different methods described by us previously (27Nikitina T. Norouzi D. Grigoryev S.A. Zhurkin V.B. DNA topology in chromatin is defined by nucleosome spacing.Sci. Adv. 2017; 3 (29098179)e170095710.1126/sciadv.1700957Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the first method, we used plasmid-based templates containing the same 183 × 12 and 188 × 12 12-nucleosome templates inserted into pUC19 vector. In these 4.7-kb–long circles, about half of DNA belongs to pUC19 vector, which is not a nucleosome positioning sequence. To ensure that the total plasmid DNA does not affect the resulting measurements of ΔLk, we inserted an additional 60-bp linker after the 183 × 12 repeat so that the net length of the 183 × 12 and 188 × 12 DNA are equal. The isolated plasmid DNA extracted from Escherichia coli has superhelical density σ = −0.06 (30Bauer W.R. Crick F.H. White J.H. Supercoiled DNA.Sci. Am. 1980; 243 (6256851): 100-113PubMed Google Scholar), which facilitates formation of nucleosomes. We reconstituted these circular plasmids with histone octamers by the standard salt dialysis method. Examination of the resulting circular plasmid nucleosome arrays by restriction nuclease protection assay and EM analysis both show practically complete incorporation of DNA into the nucleosomes at the histone octamer/nucleosome ratio of ∼1.0 (Fig. S2, C and D). After reconstitution with histones, the nucleosome arrays were relaxed with topoisomerase I, deproteinized, and the supercoiled DNA analyzed on agarose gels containing intercalator chloroquine (CQ) that is needed to increase positive DNA supercoiling and resolve the fast-migrating DNA topoisomers (31Shure M. Pulleyblank D.E. Vinograd J. The problems of eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA packaging and in vivo conformation posed by superhelix density heterogeneity.Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4 (197488): 1183-120510.1093/nar/4.5.1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Comparison of the electrophoretic mobility of single copy DNA obtained with variable histone loading shows the increase in the superhelical density of DNA that accompanies formation of nucleosomes (Fig. 2A). Without core histones, both DNA circles, p-183 × 12 and p-188 × 12 are equally relaxed (ΔLk = 0) and run near the bottom of the gel (lanes 1 and 2). Gradual increase in the core histone loading increases the superhelical density and accordingly changes the electrophoretic mobility, which first increases and then decreases so that for DNA with 80–100% histone loading we achieve the optimal resolution of DNA topoisomers on the gel in the presence of 1.5 μg/ml CQ (Fig. 2A). Using densitometry scanning of the agarose gels we can accurately determine the difference in the DNA linking number, Δ(ΔLk), induced by formation of nucleosomes. Evaluation of the linking number difference between the peak values in p-183 × 12 and p-188 × 12 nucleosome arrays gives a change of Δ(ΔLk) = 4 supercoils (sc) (Fig. 2B). Provided that the nucleosome arrays have the same number of “601” nucleosomes and the vector-associated nucleosomes are not supposed to change between the two samples, our data show a substantial difference in Δ(ΔLk) = 0.33 (per “601” nucleosome) between the p-183 × 12 and p-188 × 12 constructs. In a complementary approach, needed to ensure that the Lk difference between the 182 × 12 and 188 × 12 arrays is not affected by vector DNA, we reconstituted minicircles containing only the repeats of 183 × 12 and 188 × 12 nucleosomes. The supercoiled DNA minicircles were prepared by ligation and relaxation by topoisomerase I in the presence of 4.0 μg/ml of EtBr yielding formation of 11 (±1) nucleosomes per minicircle (27Nikitina T. Norouzi D. Grigoryev S.A. Zhurkin V.B. DNA topology in chromatin is defined by nucleosome spacing.Sci. Adv. 2017; 3 (29098179)e170095710.1126/sciadv.1700957Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of nucleosomes with histone octamers leading to full saturation of the nucleosome templates as assayed by BamHI digestion (Fig. S3) provided a result qualitatively similar to that in the case of the plasmid-based circles, namely, DNA in 188 × 12 arrays is more negatively supercoiled than in 183 × 12 arrays (Fig. 2, C and D), with the topological difference Δ(ΔLk) = 3.5 sc. To evaluate the absolute ΔLk values in these minicircles, we used the same approach we employed recently analyzing the 167 × 12 and 172 × 12 minicircle arrays (27Nikitina T. Norouzi D. Grigoryev S.A. Zhurkin V.B. DNA topology in chromatin is defined by nucleosome spacing.Sci. Adv. 2017; 3 (29098179)e170095710.1126/sciadv.1700957Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As a reference we used the supercoiled 188 × 12 minicircles (denoted sc188 in Fig. 2, C and D), having on average 12 negative supercoils determined as described (27Nikitina T. Norouzi D.

Comparison with sc188 gives us ΔLk = −11.5 sc for 183 × 12 arrays and −15 sc for 188 × 12 arrays (Fig. 2, C and D). The ΔLk values recalculated per nucleosome (Table 1) demonstrate a very good agreement between our topological gel assay (Fig. 2) and Monte Carlo simulations (32Norouzi D. Zhurkin V.B.

Thus, with two different approaches, we were able to show that the linker DNA length difference in the nucleosome repeats typical of higher vertebrates (NRL = 183–188 bp) could significantly affect DNA topology consistent with computational modeling (25Norouzi D.

Their growing number challenges the paradigm of a strong relationship between structure and function. Those proteins require new strategies to study their shape and their interactions. Here we focus on proteins composed of structured domains linked by disordered segments. Those segments and thus the whole protein can adopt a broad ensemble of conformations. These ensembles are highly influenced by their environment. In particular, the molecular crowding, the local ion concentrations, pH, or viscosity present in live cells may change the set of accessible conformations. Nevertheless, when they are associated with diseases, knowledge about both their structure and their affinity with partners is essential to identify potential drug targets in medicinal chemistry.

The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is one of the seven isoforms of the Nox family and a major enzyme of the immune system because of its pronounced production of microbicidal reactive oxygen species (ROS). A pathological hyperactivity of this oxidase leads to chronic inflammation, which is associated with cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (3Sumimoto H. Structure, regulation and evolution of Nox-family NADPH oxidases that produce reactive oxygen species.FEBS J. 2008; 275 (18513324): 3249-327710.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06488.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The activity is regulated by the spatiotemporal organization of the intra- and intermolecular interactions of its cytosolic subunits, p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox, forming a soluble complex before activation. Upon activation, these subunits translocate together with the small GTPase Rac to the membrane subunits Nox2 and p22phox to form the active oxidase complex. The protein interactions within the cytosolic complex were extensively studied in vitro (Fig. 1) (3Sumimoto H. Structure, regulation and evolution of Nox-family NADPH oxidases that produce reactive oxygen species.FEBS J. 2008; 275 (18513324): 3249-327710.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06488.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In addition to the interactions between p40phox and p67phox or p47phox and p67phox, an interaction between the SH3 domain of p40phox and the PRR domain of p47phox has been observed, but its physiological relevance is not clear (4Massenet C.

Only domains either isolated or in interaction were solved (3Sumimoto H.

To date, neither the spatial organization nor the stoichiometric composition of the entire complex in live cells was clarified. Using live cell FRET–FLIM and FCCS approaches with fluorescent protein-tagged subunits, we demonstrated a 1:1:1 stoichiometry of the three subunits, estimated their affinity, and analyzed their spatial organization. Finally, we used these findings to elaborate a new 3D in silico model of the entire cytosolic complex in the live cell situation. This model shows an elongated complex and a flexible hinge. It is fully compatible with the multiple steps of oxidase activation. In addition, it can guide the identification of potential sites for anti-inflammatory drug targets to regulate the NADPH oxidase activity. The cytosolic subunits p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox were tagged with fluorescent proteins (FPs; Table S1), either cyan (CFP: mTurquoise or Aquamarine) (7Merola F. Erard M. Fredj A. Pasquier H.

Biotechnol. 2004; 22 (15558047): 1567-157210.1038/nbt1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar). The size of the fusion proteins expressed by COS7 cells was verified by Western blotting (Fig. S1A). To assess whether the FP-labeled subunits are able to reconstitute the active oxidase complex, we used COSNox2/p22 cells stably expressing the membranous subunits Nox2/p22phox and Rac, but no endogenous cytosolic subunits (10Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. Biosynthesis of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase cytochrome b558: role of heme incorporation and heterodimer formation in maturation and stability of gp91phox and p22phox subunits.J.

COSNox2/p22 were transiently transfected with the three cytosolic subunits with or without a FP tag (Fig. 2A). The production of superoxide anions was monitored by a luminometry assay sensitive to extracellular ROS (Fig. 2B). The ROS production started upon activation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and stopped immediately after addition of diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a NADPH oxidase inhibitor. All constructs allowed a pronounced ROS production (Fig. 2C). The production with N-terminal tagged p47phox and p67phox was lower compared with the C-terminal tagged variants but still much higher than the nontransfected cells. The presence of the FP tags slowed down the ROS production and consequently delayed the time point at which the maximal signal was reached (Fig. S1, B and C). Taken together, these observations show that all our FP-tagged subunits are able to reconstitute an active NADPH oxidase complex and are fully suitable to explore their spatial organization and affinity. FRET is observed between fluorescent proteins at both ends of individual subunits and is not strongly modified in presence of their partners. We then tagged each of the cytosolic subunits p40phox, p47phox and p67phox simultaneously at both termini with a donor (D) and an acceptor (A) FP for FRET, resulting in so-called tandems (Fig. 3 and Table S1). We used as a positive control a simple D/A tandem in which the donor and acceptor FPs were linked by a flexible 27-amino acid-long peptide (11Betolngar D.-B. Erard M. Pasquier H. Bousmah Y. Diop-Sy A. Guiot E. Vincent P. Mérola F. pH sensitivity of FRET reporters based on cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins.Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2015; 407 (25814274): 4183-419310.1007/s00216-015-8636-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Tandems were expressed in COS7 cells, and FRET was monitored by FLIM. The apparent FRET efficiencies, Eapp, were derived from the average fluorescence lifetime of the donor FP measured in individual cells (Equations 1–4 under “Experimental procedures”). Eapp values for the p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox tandems were significant, although lower than in the simple D/A tandem (Eapp = 8.2 ± 1.2%, 12.3 ± 1.2%, 7.7 ± 1.1%, and 32.7 ± 1.8%, respectively; Fig. 3B). The low Eapp values for the subunit tandems are consistent with the much larger size of the central subunits as compared with a 27-amino acid peptide linker. Next, we studied the influence of the p67phox partner on the p47phox tandem and of p40phox on the p67phox tandem. Either p47phox or p67phox tandems were co-expressed with a plasmid coding for the partner subunit connected to RFP via the viral P2A peptide (12Kim J.H. Lee S.-R. Li L.-H. Park H.-J. Park J.-H.

High cleavage efficiency of a 2A peptide derived from porcine teschovirus-1 in human cell lines, zebrafish and mice.PLoS One. 2011; 6 (21602908)e1855610.1371/journal.pone.0018556Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 13Goedhart J. van Weeren L.

The P2A sequence prevents the peptide bond formation and leads to the separate expression of the subunit and the RFP, the presence of the RFP proving the correct expression of the partner subunit. The co-expression of tandems with RFP alone was taken as reference (Fig. 3C). The co-expression of RFP-2A-p67phox did not change the apparent FRET efficiency in the p47phox tandem, and similarly, the presence of p40phox did not modify the FRET level of the p67phox tandem (Fig. 3C and Fig. S2), showing that in both cases, the overall geometry of the tandem is not significantly modified upon interaction with their partners. The bimolecular interaction between FP-tagged cytosolic subunits was then investigated using similar FLIM-FRET methodologies (Fig. 4). First, we studied the interaction of p67phox and p47phox (Fig. 4, A–C and F). Upon co-expression of p47phox-CFP/p67phox-YFP, the lifetimes of the CFP donor were on average significantly shorter than the reference value for p47phox-CFP alone (Fig. 4, A and B). However, as usual in dual expression systems, FRET efficiencies Eapp varied strongly from cell to cell, depending on the amount of expressed acceptor. We thus determined Eapp as a function of the acceptor quantity, as estimated from its average fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4C), or as a function of the ratio [A]/[D] (Fig. 4F), using a custom calibration procedure (see supporting information), as shown by others (14Cardarelli F. Bizzarri R. Serresi M. Albertazzi L. Beltram F. Probing nuclear localization signal–importin α binding equilibria in living cells.J. Biol.

Rep. 2016; 6 (27833095)3679210.1038/srep36792Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In all cases, the FRET efficiency increases with the absolute or relative amount of acceptor. For p47phox and p67phox subunits labeled at their C termini (CC labeling), Eapp reaches a maximum value ∼12% at high acceptor levels (Fig. 4, C and F). This is significantly higher than the negative control, consisting of the co-expression of p47phox-CFP with YFP alone (Fig. 4C and Fig. S3A). As a second negative control, we used a truncated version of p47phox missing the PRR domain (p47phoxΔCter [1–342]) and leading in vitro to a complete abrogation of any interaction with p67phox (16Marcoux J. Man P. Petit-Haertlein I. Vivès C. Forest E. Fieschi F. p47phox molecular activation for assembly of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase complex.J. Biol.

The co-expression of p47phoxΔCter-CFP with p67phox-YFP gives clearly different FLIM images as compared with p47phox-CFP, with well-separated average lifetime distributions (Fig. 4, A and B), and measured Eapp values in the range of the first negative control (Fig. 4C and Fig. S3A). The observation of a plateau value for Eapp, well above the values of the controls, provides strong evidence for a specific interaction (17Grailhe R. Merola F. Ridard J. Couvignou S. Le Poupon C. Changeux J.-P. Laguitton-Pasquier H. Monitoring protein interactions in the living cell through the fluorescence decays of the cyan fluorescent protein.ChemPhysChem. 2006; 7 (16739159): 1442-145410.1002/cphc.200600057Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The absence of significant FRET in the case of p47phoxΔCter shows in addition that the PRR domain of p47phox is required for this interaction in live cells. We then modified the labeling sites of our FP tags, either by switching them to the N termini or by exchanging FP colors between p47phox and p67phox (Fig. 4, C and F). For the CN tags, the maximum Eapp of 8% was lower than for the CC labeling (Fig. 4F), yet significantly above the negative controls (Fig. S3A). For the NN tags, Eapp values remained very low and close to the range of the negative controls (Fig. 4C and Fig. S3A). To evaluate independently the occurrence of an interaction between p47phox and p67phox tagged at their N termini, we used FCCS. In this technique, the fluctuations of the fluorescence intensities of FP-tagged p47phox and p67phox diffusing in and out a confocal volume in the cytosol of COS7 cells are analyzed by auto- and cross-correlation functions (see “Experimental procedures”). A cross-correlation function with a non-null amplitude was observed for p47phox and p67phox tagged either at their CC and NN termini (Fig. 5A), showing in both cases a co-diffusion of the fluorophores indicative of complex formation. We thus observe a specific interaction between p47phox and p67phox cytosolic subunits for all tested positions and types of FP tags, with in most cases Eapp well above negative controls. Apparent FRET efficiencies measured in living cells are very complex average quantities. In addition, the efficiency of energy transfer depends on both the distance and relative orientation between the donor and the acceptor, as predicted by Förster theory (see “Experimental procedures”). Because the fluorescent proteins are attached to the subunits through variable flexible linkers (Table S1), a large range of relative FP orientations are likely allowed, leading to some averaging of the orientation factor. In the frame of this paper, we will thus assume that major differences in FRET efficiencies are chiefly governed by distance. This is supported by the similar FRET efficiencies observed when different D/A pairs are used or when the anchoring sites of donor and acceptor are swapped (see for example Fig. 4, C and F). In this frame, the relative FRET efficiencies observed for donor and acceptor located at different termini provide interesting topological information. The maximum apparent FRET efficiency is higher for the CC labeling than for the CN labeling (Fig. 4F). Indeed, the two C termini are known to bind to each other and should be closer than the N terminus of p67phox and the C terminus of p47phox, which are separated by p67phox itself (Fig. 1). For the NN labeling, the distance between FPs is most likely too large to observe FRET, because we have evidence for complex formation through FCCS. The upper distance limit for a FRET-positive situation is approximately twice the Förster radius of the FRET pair (see “Experimental procedures”), ∼100 Å. To fulfill this distance condition, the N termini of both subunits should point to opposite directions in the complex. We studied similarly the interactions between FP-tagged p40phox and p67phox (Fig. 4, D and G, and Fig. S3B). For all tag positions (NC, NN, or CC), specific FRET was observed with the same maximum efficiency, ∼8% at the plateau (Fig. 4, D and G). The similar maximum FRET efficiencies indicate comparable distances between the different termini of p40phox and p67phox. The direct p40phox–p47phox interaction was questioned to be of physiological relevance or to be rather an artificial phenomenon resulting from test tube experiments in the absence of p67phox (4Massenet C. Chenavas S. Cohen-Addad C. Dagher M.-C. Brandolin G. Pebay-Peyroula E. Fieschi F. Effects of p47phox C terminus phosphorylations on binding interactions with p40phox and p67phox: structural and functional comparison of p40phox and p67phox SH3 domains.J. Biol.

The possible interaction sites were identified in vitro to be the SH3 domain of p40phox and the C-terminal PRR domain of p47phox, which is also the binding site for p67phox (Fig. 1). We co-expressed p40phox and p47phox or its truncated version p47phoxΔCter with NC or CC labeling (Fig. 4, E and H). We found specific FRET in both cases with equivalent Eapp, which indicates that the FP tags at both termini of p40phox have a similar average geometry relative to the C terminus of p47phox. When p47phoxΔCter was used instead of full-length p47phox, no significant FRET was observed (Fig. 4E and Fig. S3C). This confirms the requirement of the PRR domain of p47phox for the interaction with p40phox in live cells. FRET depends strongly on the number of acceptors in the direct vicinity of the donor and thus allows exploration of the stoichiometry of the interaction (18Vogel S.S. Thaler C. Koushik S.V. Fanciful FRET.Sci. STKE. 2006; 2006 (16622184): re210.1126/stke.3312006re2PubMed Google Scholar). An uneven stoichiometry of the subunits in the complex (X:Y) will result in different maximum Eapp when the donor and acceptor are swapped between subunits (Fig. S4). In contrast, even subunit ratios (X:X) will give the same maximum Eapp. On heterodimers formed by p47phox/p67phox, as well as by p40phox/p67phox, swapping donor and acceptor did not change the maximum apparent FRET efficiency (Fig. 4, F and G). We also investigated possible homodimerization of the cytosolic subunits by co-expressing each subunit tagged with donor and acceptor FPs in the same cell. In all cases, the Eapp scatters in the range of the negative controls (Fig. S5), indicating that there are no detectable homodimers. Taken together, our findings support a 1:1:1 stoichiometry for the cytosolic complex in the living cell, in agreement with in vitro experiments (19Stasia M.J. Li X.J. Genetics and immunopathology of chronic granulomatous disease.Semin. Immunopathol. 2008; 30 (18509647): 209-23510.1007/s00281-008-0121-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Nauseef W.M.

The amplitudes of the auto- and cross-correlation functions obtained by FCCS provide an estimate of the relative expression levels of the FP-tagged subunits and of their fraction in interaction (“Experimental procedures” and supporting information). The FCCS analysis gives qualitatively similar results with FRET-positive CC labeling or FRET-negative NN labeling (Fig. 5B). In both cases, the fraction of interacting protein is correlated to the relative expression level of the proteins. Although all p67phox is bound in complex in the presence of a 2-fold excess of p47phox, the fraction of p47phox interacting with p67phox decreases concomitantly. The apparent fraction of molecules in interaction is somewhat lower for the FRET-positive CC labeling than for the FRET-negative NN labeling, which may be ascribed to a FRET-induced decrease of the amplitude of the cross-correlation function (21Foo Y.H. Naredi-Rainer N. Lamb D.C. Ahmed S. Wohland T. Factors affecting the quantification of biomolecular interactions by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy.Biophys.

The concentration of bound and free diffusing p47phox and p67phox obtained from the FCCS measurement can also be used to estimate their apparent dissociation constant, KDapp (see supporting information). The median KDapp value is in the range of a few hundred nanomolar, showing a high affinity between p47phox and p67phox in live cells. Such a high affinity, with a KD well below 1 μm, is consistent with previous values obtained in vitro ranging from 4 to 32 nm (22Karimi G. Houée Levin C. Dagher M.C. Baciou L. Bizouarn T.

In conclusion, FRET imaging and FCCS experiments in live cells clearly demonstrate specific interactions between the three cytosolic subunits of the NADPH oxidase and give new insights into their spatial organization in the complexes. In the next paragraphs, we will use this information, together with SAXS, NMR, and X-ray crystallography data, to build a 3D model of the heterotrimer. The crystallographic structure of p40phox was solved (5Honbou K. Minakami R. Yuzawa S. Takeya R. Suzuki N.N. Kamakura S. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. Full-length p40phox structure suggests a basis for regulation mechanism of its membrane binding.EMBO J. 2007; 26 (17290225): 1176-118610.1038/sj.emboj.7601561Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but p47phox and p67phox are highly flexible, and only some domains were crystallized. First, we will describe how several putative conformations of p67phox and p47phox were selected from SAXS experiments. Second, we will assemble the individual subunits and choose along this process the most appropriate conformation of p47phox and p67phox, with the help of the topological information obtained from FRET, to finally propose a 3D model of the heterotrimer compatible with our live cell experiments, as well as structural and biochemical results available in the literature. SAXS analysis consists in producing a set of atomic models compatible with the experimental SAXS curves using existing high-resolution structures of the crystallized domains, as explained under “Experimental procedures.” For p67phox, we re-examined previous experimental SAXS results (23Durand D.

This species has strong osmoregulatory capacity and can maintain stringent internal homeostasis. However, the mechanisms conferring tolerance to salinity fluctuations are not well understood. To reveal the genes and pathways involved in osmoregulation, adult male crabs (body weight = 110 ± 5 g) were acclimated for 144 h in freshwater (FW, 0 ppt) or seawater (SW, 25 ppt). Changes in the transcriptome of crab gills were then analysed by RNA-Seq, and 174,903 unigenes were obtained. Comparison of genes between FW- SW-acclimated groups identified 932 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in the gill, comprising 433 and 499 up- and downregulated transcripts. Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis revealed that important biological processes related to salt stress were significantly enriched, including energy metabolism, ion transport, signal transduction and antioxidant activity. Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis mapped the differentially expressed genes to 241 specific metabolic pathways, and pathways related to energy metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)/citrate cycle were significantly enriched. Salinity stress altered the expression of many enzymes involved in energy metabolism, ion transport, signal transduction and antioxidant pathways, including citrate synthase (CS), Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), Na+-K+-2Cl cotransporter-1 (NKCC1), dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1), synaptic binding protein 1 (STXBP1), Cu2+/Zn2+ superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Additionally, the obtained transcriptomic sequencing data provided a useful resource for identification of novel genes, and further physiological analysis of Chinese mitten crab."

As per World Health Organisation (WHO) in the 2016 report, 40% women of reproductive age suffer from anaemia. According to the National Micronutrient Survey 2011–2012, 57% women suffer from zinc deficiency. The objective of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of fortified rice (FFR in addressing anaemia and zinc deficiency among vulnerable women. Baseline and endline surveys were conducted among female Vulnerable Group Development (VDG) beneficiaries in five districts in Bangladesh before and after 12 months of FFR distribution. The intervention group received 30 kg FFR; the control group received 30 kg non-FFR for every month from January 2013 to December 2013. The sample sizes were 870 women (435/group) at baseline and 800 (400/group) at endline. Difference-in-difference (DID) was estimated to measure the effect of FFR on anaemia and serum zinc. In the baseline survey, 39% of the FFR group and 34% of the non-FFR group had anaemia. At endline, 34% of women in the FFR group were anaemic compared to 40.7% in the non-FFR group. At endline, prevalence of anaemia was reduced in the FFR group by 4.8% but increased in the non-FFR group by 6.7%. The DID estimation showed the reduction in anaemia after 12 months of FFR consumption was significant (p = 0.035). The DID in mean haemoglobin level after 12 months of FFR consumption was also statistically significant (p = 0.002). Zinc deficiency decreased by 6% in the FFR group at endline, though the DID was not significant. Most of the respondents of the FFR group reported that they received their entitled rice on a regular basis however only half of the non-FFR respondents received every month in 12 months. Anaemia was significantly associated with not consuming fortified rice, geographical region, older age and heavy menstrual bleeding (P<0.05). FFR reduced anaemia and zinc deficiency prevalence. Replacement of regular rice with FFR in the VGD programme is recommended to reduce anaemia among vulnerable groups."

We bring new evidence indicating that palmitate up-regulates cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression levels in human islets and in MIN6 β cells, and that it is elevated in islets isolated from T2D donors. Both small interfering specific cyclooxygenase-2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by palmitate. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the predominant product of COX-2 enzymatic activity, activates membrane receptors, which are members of the GPCR-family (EP1-EP4). In the present study, elevated expression of the PGE2 receptor subtype 3 (EP3) receptor was observed in β cells exposed to palmitate and in islets from individuals with T2D. Down-regulation of the pathway using EP3 siRNA or the specific L-798, 106 antagonist markedly decreased the levels of palmitate-induced apoptosis. Altogether, our data put forward the COX-2-PGE2-EP3 pathway as one of the mediators of palmitate-induced apoptosis in β-cells.—Amior, L., Srivastava, R., Nano, R., Bertuzzi, F., Melloul, D.

https://openalex.org/W2910093182,"Traditionally the gold-standard technique for the treatment of spontaneous abortion has been uterine evacuation by aspiration curettage. However, many studies have proposed medical treatment with misoprostol as an alternative to the conventional surgical treatment. The aim of this study was to apply cost minimization methods to compare the cost and effectiveness of the use of vaginal misoprostol as a medical treatment for first trimester spontaneous abortion with those of evacuation curettage as a surgical treatment.We present a longitudinal, prospective and quasi-experimental research study including a total of 547 patients diagnosed with first-trimester spontaneous abortion, in the period from January 2013 to December 2015. Patients were offered medical treatment with 800 mg vaginal misoprostol or evacuation curettage. Patients treated with misoprostol were followed-up at 7 days and a transvaginal ultrasound was performed to confirm the success of the treatment. If it failed, a second dose of 800 mg of vaginal misoprostol was prescribed and a new control ultrasound was performed. In case of failure of medical treatment after the second dose of misoprostol, evacuation curettage was indicated. The effectiveness of each of the treatment options was calculated using a decision tree. The cost minimization study was carried out by weighting each cost according to the effectiveness of each branch of the treatment. Of the 547 patients who participated in the study, 348 (64%) chose medical treatment and 199 (36%) chose surgical treatment. The overall effectiveness of medical treatment was 81% (283/348) and surgical treatment of 100%. The estimated final cost for medical treatment was € 461.92 compared to € 2038.72 for surgical treatment, which represents an estimated average saving per patient of € 1576.8.Medical treatment with misoprostol is a cheaper alternative to surgery: in the Spanish Public Healthcare System, it is five times more inexpensive than curettage. Given its success rates higher than 80%, mild side effects, controllable with additional medication and the high degree of overall satisfaction, it should be prioritized over the evacuation curettage in patients who meet the treatment criteria."
https://openalex.org/W2952244511,"Stress profoundly impacts the brain and increases the risk of developing a psychiatric disorder. The brain’s response to stress is mediated by a number of pathways that affect gene expression and protein function throughout the cell. Understanding how stress achieves such dramatic effects on the brain requires an understanding of the brain’s stress response pathways. The majority of studies focused on molecular changes have employed repeated or chronic stress paradigms to assess the long-term consequences of stress and have not taken an integrative genomic and/or proteomic approach. Here, we determined the lasting impact of a single stressful event (restraint) on the broad molecular profile of the basolateral amygdala complex (BLC), a key brain region mediating emotion, memory and stress. Molecular profiling performed thirty days post-restraint consisted of small RNA sequencing, RNA sequencing and quantitative mass spectrometry and identified long-lasting changes in microRNA (miRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA) and proteins. Alignment of the three datasets further delineated the regulation of stress-specific pathways which were validated by qPCR and Western Blot analysis. From this analysis, mir-29a-5p was identified as a putative regulator of stress-induced adaptations in the BLC. Further, a number of predicted mir-29a-5p targets are regulated at the mRNA and protein level. The concerted and long-lasting disruption of multiple molecular pathways in the amygdala by a single stress event is expected to be sufficient to alter behavioral responses to a wide array of future experiences, including exposure to additional stressors."
https://openalex.org/W2909228022,"Oceanic islands can be relatively isolated from overfishing and pollution sources, but they are often extremely vulnerable to climate and anthropogenic stress due to their small size and unique assemblages that may rely on a limited larval supply for replenishment. Vulnerability may be especially high when these islands bear permanent human populations or are subjected to regular or intermittent fishing. Since the late 1970's, Brazil has been establishing marine protected areas (MPAs) around its four oceanic island groups, which concentrate high endemism levels and are considered peripheral outposts of the Brazilian Biogeographic Province. In 2018, the Brazilian legally marine protected area increased >10-fold, but most of the ~1,000,000 km2 of MPAs around Brazil's oceanic islands are still unknown and unprotected. Here, we provide the first detailed quantitative baseline of benthic reef assemblages, including shallow and mesophotic zones, of the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago (FNA). The archipelago is partially protected as a no-take MPA and recognized by the UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, but also represents the only Brazilian oceanic island with a large permanent human population (3,000 people), mass tourism (up to 90,000 people per year) and a permanent small-scale fishing community. The influence of depth, wave exposure, and distance from the island and shelf edge on the structure of benthic assemblages was assessed from benthic photoquadrats obtained in 12 sites distributed in the lee and windward shores of the archipelago. Unique assemblages and discriminating species were identified using Multivariate Regression Trees, and environmental drivers of dominant assemblages’ components were evaluated using Boosted Regression Trees. A total of 128 benthic taxa were recorded and 5 distinct assemblages were identified. Distance to the insular slope, depth and exposure were the main drivers of assemblages’ differentiation. Our results represent an important baseline for evaluating changes in benthic assemblages due to increased local and global stressors."
https://openalex.org/W2909951994,"After intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), brain edema commonly occurs and can cause death. Along with edema, there are significant alterations in the concentrations of key ions such as sodium, potassium, and chloride, which are essential to brain function. NKCC1, a cation-chloride cotransporter, is upregulated after brain damage, such as traumatic injury and ischemic stroke. NKCC1 brings sodium and chloride into the cell, possibly worsening ion dyshomeostasis. Bumetanide, a specific NKCC1 antagonist, blocks the transport of chloride into cells, and thus should attenuate the increases in chloride, which should lessen brain edema and improve neuronal functioning post-ICH, as with other injuries. We used the collagenase model of ICH to test whether bumetanide treatment for three days (vs. vehicle) would improve outcome. We gave bumetanide beginning at two hours or seven days post-ICH and measured behavioural outcome, edema, and brain ion content after treatment. There was some evidence for a minor reduction in edema after early dosing, but this did not improve behaviour or lessen injury. Contrary to our hypothesis, bumetanide did not normalize ion concentrations after late dosing. Bumetanide did not improve behavioural outcome or affect lesion volume. After ICH, bumetanide is safe to use in rats but does not improve functional outcome in the majority of animals."

The effects of dietary Ca on body composition and lipid metabolism were examined in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed high-fat, high-energy diets containing (g/kg) low (0.75Ca, 0.86 ± 0.05; 2Ca, 2.26 ± 0.02), normal (5Ca, 5.55 ± 0.08) or high (10Ca, 11.03 ± 0.17; 20Ca, 21.79 ± 0.15) Ca for 10 weeks. Rats fed the lowest Ca diet (0.75Ca) had lower (p < 0.05) body weight and fat mass compared to other groups. Rats fed the high Ca diets had lower serum total and LDL cholesterol compared to rats fed normal or low Ca. Liver total cholesterol was lower in rats fed high compared to low Ca. In general, liver mRNA expression of genes involved in cholesterol uptake from the circulation (Ldlr), cholesterol synthesis (Hmgcr and Hmgcs1), fatty acid oxidation (Cpt2) and cholesterol esterification (Acat2) were higher in rats fed higher Ca. Apparent digestibility of total trans, saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids was lower in rats fed the high compared to the low Ca diets, with the largest effects seen on trans and saturated fatty acids. Fecal excretion of cholesterol and total bile acids was highest in rats fed the highest Ca diet (20Ca). The results suggest little effect of dietary Ca on body composition unless Ca intakes are very low. Decreased bile acid reabsorption and reduced absorption of neutral sterols and saturated and trans fatty acids may contribute to the better serum lipid profile in rats fed higher Ca."

Upper respiratory tract specimens were collected from patients with symptoms of influenza-like illness. A total of 2,860 respiratory samples were screened by influenza rapid diagnostic test, of which 1,577 (55.1%) and 810 (28.3%) were positive for influenza A and B, respectively. Of the 1,010 specimens that were positive for virus isolation, 370 (36.6%) were A(H1N1)pdm09, 327 (32.4%) were A(H3N2), 130 (12.9%) B(Victoria), and 183 (18.1%) were B(Yamagata) viruses. Our data showed that influenza epidemics mainly occurred during the rainy season in Myanmar. Our three study sites, Yangon, Pyinmana, and Pyin Oo Lwin had similar seasonality and circulating type and subtype of influenza in a given year. Moreover, viruses circulating in Myanmar during the study period were closely related genetically to those detected in Thailand, India, and China. Phylogeographic analysis showed that A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in Myanmar originated from Europe and migrated to other countries via Japan. Similarly, A(H3N2) viruses in Myanmar originated from Europe, and disseminated to the various countries via Australia. In addition, Myanmar plays a key role in reseeding of influenza B viruses to Southeast Asia and East Asia as well as Europe and Africa. Thus, we concluded that influenza virus in Myanmar has a strong link to neighboring Asian countries, Europe and Oceania."
https://openalex.org/W2910487555,"The western corn rootworm (WCR, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) gene, dvssj1, is a putative homolog of the Drosophila melanogaster gene, snakeskin (ssk). This gene encodes a membrane protein associated with the smooth septate junction (SSJ) which is required for the proper barrier function of the epithelial lining of insect intestines. Disruption of DVSSJ integrity by RNAi technique has been shown previously to be an effective approach for corn rootworm control, by apparent suppression of production of DVSSJ1 protein leading to growth inhibition and mortality. To understand the mechanism that leads to the death of WCR larvae by dvssj1 double-stranded RNA, we examined the molecular characteristics associated with SSJ functions during larval development. Dvssj1 dsRNA diet feeding results in dose-dependent suppression of mRNA and protein; this impairs SSJ formation and barrier function of the midgut and results in larval mortality. These findings suggest that the malfunctioning of the SSJ complex in midgut triggered by dvssj1 silencing is the principal cause of WCR death. This study also illustrates that dvssj1 is a midgut-specific gene in WCR and its functions are consistent with biological functions described for ssk."
https://openalex.org/W2909132761,"High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) constitutively activate ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia- and Rad3-related (ATR) DNA damage repair pathways for viral genome amplification. HPVs activate these pathways through the immune regulator STAT-5. For the ATR pathway, STAT-5 increases expression of the topoisomerase IIβ-binding protein 1 (TopBP1), a scaffold protein that binds ATR and recruits it to sites of DNA damage. TopBP1 also acts as a transcriptional regulator, and we investigated how this activity influenced the HPV life cycle. We determined that TopBP1 levels are increased in cervical intraepithelial neoplasias as well as cervical carcinomas, consistent with studies in HPV-positive cell lines. Suppression of TopBP1 by shRNAs impairs HPV genome amplification and activation of the ATR pathway but does not affect the total levels of ATR and CHK1. In contrast, knockdown reduces the expression of other DNA damage factors such as RAD51 and Mre11 but not BRCA2 or NBS1. Interestingly, TopBP1 positively regulates the expression of E2F1, a TopBP1-binding partner, and p73 in HPV-positive cells in contrast to its effects in other cell types. TopBP1 transcriptional activity is regulated by AKT, and treatment with AKT inhibitors suppresses expression of E2F1 and p73 without interfering with ATR signaling. Importantly, the levels of p73 are elevated in HPV-positive cells and its knockdown impairs HPV genome amplification. This demonstrates that p73, like p63 and p53, is an important regulator of the HPV life cycle that is controlled by the transcriptional activating properties of the multifunctional TopBP1 protein."

However, they have been suggested to be not only important to citizens but the values most vulnerable to climate change. Here we test four empirical consequences of the suggestion: (i) at least 50% of the locations citizens' consider to be the most important locations in their municipality are chosen because they represent these values, (ii) locations representing these values have a high probability of being damaged by climate change induced sea level rise, (iii) citizens for which these values are particularly strongly held less strongly believe in the local effects of climate change, and (iv) citizens for which these values are particularly strongly held less strongly believe that they have experienced the effects of climate change. The tests were made using survey data collected in 2014 from 326 citizens owning property in Höganäs municipality, Sweden, and included values elicited using a new methodology separating instrumental values from end values, and using the former (which strictly speaking should be seen as estimates of usefulness rather than as aims in themselves) as stepping stones to pinpoint the latter, that represent the true interests of the respondents. The results provide the first evidence that, albeit frequent, values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are not the values most vulnerable to climate change. This in turn indicates a need to further investigate the vulnerability of these values to climate change, using a methodology that clearly distinguishes between instrumental and end values."

Current submission procedures can be complex and prohibitively time expensive for any but a small number of input sequences. A user-friendly software tool is needed that streamlines the file preparation for database submissions of DNA sequences that are commonly generated in plant and fungal DNA barcoding.A Python package was developed that converts DNA sequences from the common EMBL and GenBank flat file formats to submission-ready, tab-delimited spreadsheets (so-called 'checklists') for a subsequent upload to the annotated sequence section of the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). The software tool, titled 'EMBL2checklists', automatically converts DNA sequences, their annotation features, and associated metadata into the idiosyncratic format of marker-specific ENA checklists and, thus, generates files that can be uploaded via the interactive Webin submission system of ENA.EMBL2checklists provides a simple, platform-independent tool that automates the conversion of common DNA barcoding sequences into easily editable spreadsheets that require no further processing but their upload to ENA via the interactive Webin submission system. The software is equipped with an intuitive graphical as well as an efficient command-line interface for its operation. The utility of the software is illustrated by its application in four recent investigations, including plant phylogenetic and fungal metagenomic studies.EMBL2checklists bridges the gap between common software suites for DNA sequence assembly and annotation and the interactive data submission process of ENA. It represents an easy-to-use solution for plant and fungal biologists without bioinformatics expertise to generate submission-ready checklists from common DNA sequence data. It allows the post-processing of checklists as well as work-sharing during the submission process and solves a critical bottleneck in the effort to increase participation in public data sharing."

The purpose of this study was to investigate if patients with positive axillary lymph nodes (LNs) proven by US guided biopsy should be recommended for ALND and to analyze the utility of preoperative US and US guided biopsy in planning axillary surgery to avoid both unnecessary ALND and unnecessary SLNB. Methods Patients with a positive preoperative LN biopsy were identified and evaluated to determine their suitability for inclusion according to the criteria proposed in the Z0011 data. The correlation of the number of suspicious nodes found using US with the number of positive nodes on ALND was studied. Results A total of 261 breast cancer patients who had a positive preoperative LN needle biopsy were identified, among them, 79 patients with cT1–2N0 breast cancer and ALND were enrolled in the study. Thirty-one patients (39.2%) had ≤2 positive nodes identified in pathology and 10 patients (12.7%) met all of the Z0011 criteria and might have been spared ALND. A significantly greater proportion of women with ≥3 positive nodes during ALND had >1 abnormal LN identified using US compared to women with ≤2 positive LNs found using ALND (66.7% vs. 6.5%, p<0.0001). Conclusion US with needle biopsy is valuable to patients with multiple suspicious nodes found using US while SLND without US guided needle biopsy is suggested if only one abnormal LN is detected on US in the post-Z0011 era."

We carried out this study to explore inter-practice variation in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) network database, a large, representative surveillance database. Methods and finding We carried out a cross-sectional study using primary care data extracted from the electronic health records of 1,271,419 adults registered at RCGP RSC general practices on 31st December 2016. Logistic regression was used to indirectly standardise practice-level hypertension prevalence and control against the RCGP RSC population, adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, deprivation, co-morbidity, NHS region and practice size. Inter-practice variation was demonstrated using funnel plots with 95% and 99.8% control limits. The prevalence of detected hypertension was 18.4% (95% CI 18.4–18.5), n = 234,165. Uncontrolled hypertension was present in 146,553 of 196,052 individuals, 25.2% (25.1–25.4), in whom blood pressure had been recorded in the previous year. Hypertension management varied markedly between practices with a three-fold difference in prevalence, 13.5–38.4%, and a four-fold difference in the proportion of uncontrolled hypertension, 11.8–47.9%. Despite adjustment for sociodemographic and practice characteristics funnel plots demonstrated marked over-dispersion. Conclusions Substantial variation in the prevalence of diagnosed hypertension and the management of hypertension was only partially explained by characteristics captured within a routine dataset. The over-dispersion suggests variation is not fully explained by these factors and that context, behaviour and processes of care delivery may contribute to variation. Routine data sources in isolation to not provide sufficient contextual data to diagnose the causes of variation."

And yet, injustices do occur: good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people. Across four experiments, we show that people respond quite differently to correct these two types of injustices. When bad things happen to good people, individuals are eager to compensate a good person’s losses, but only do so to a small degree. In contrast, when a good thing happens to a bad person, because the only perceived appropriate act of punishment is to fully strip the bad actor of all his or her illegitimate gains, few people choose to punish in this costly way. However, when they do, they do so to very large degrees. Moreover, we demonstrate that differential psychological mechanisms drive this asymmetry."

https://openalex.org/W2909042904,"I was introduced to a whale named Lucky during my first year of grad school. I study North Atlantic right whales—many of whom are scarred by traumatic injuries. Lucky's were dramatic: jagged marks from a brush with a large ship propeller when she was a juvenile. My own story, I've come to realize, is similar, although my scars are less obvious. Eleven years ago, when I was a third-year Ph.D. student, my son Silas died in my arms. He was just 3 days old. The birth nearly took my wife's life as well. Graduating the next year felt like nothing short of a miracle. I was Dr. Schick—the first in my family! I thought it meant that I had recovered from the depths of my loss and had a bright academic future. But there was more to my story—and to Lucky's.

> “Like the whales I study, we all carry the scars of our pasts.” 

Researchers studying Lucky were thrilled and amazed when she became pregnant. Yet as her pregnancy progressed, she gained girth, and the increasing pressure ultimately split the scar tissue. She developed sepsis, and—along with her unborn calf—Lucky died.

Two years after my son's death, pressure was building on my own internal scars. My family and I had moved to get away from the constant reminder of our loss, and at first it seemed to be working. I had a good postdoc position, my wife was healing, and my daughter was heading into kindergarten. On the surface, we were all doing relatively well.

But when I took a work trip back to our old city, suddenly everything started to fall apart. I began to struggle with anxiety. I started to have panic attacks that led to a nervous breakdown. I realized that I needed to devote time to healing instead of burying my grief. I needed to acknowledge and treat my wounds so that they wouldn't put me in danger in the future.

The best way to do this, I thought, would be to make a major change. I found a new postdoc position across the ocean, in Scotland. The change of location and perspective put me on a better track. Our 4 years abroad helped heal my family, and the challenge of living in a new culture made us even more tight-knit. I worked with a wonderful, kind therapist who helped me unpack and examine my grief. I started to feel a little bit more comfortable with our trauma—sometimes telling people about Silas rather than always keeping the story hidden.

At the same time, I needed to figure out my next career step—and I knew I had to take my emotional well-being into account. I had always hoped for a tenure-track job, and I applied for a few, but I never fully embraced the process. I didn't want to risk disappointment, and I worried that if I succeeded in landing a position, I wouldn't be able to handle the stress that would come with it. Ever since the death of my son, my anxiety threshold is much lower.

Through a bit of networking and some luck, I found a job as a soft-money research scientist back at my Ph.D. institution. At first, this felt like a failure. In the 2 years since, though, a funny thing has happened: I'm not the research star I hoped I would be, and few days go by when I don't think about my son, but I find myself content. I'm doing meaningful work surrounded by colleagues whom I respect and admire.

Though I will always bear the scars from my son's death, time and emotional work help keep them from reopening, and I have found peace with how my trauma is woven into the story of my life. Like the whales I study, we all carry the scars of our pasts. The burdens can be heavy, but we needn't add to them by trying to ignore or hide them.

As for the right whales, their population now numbers approximately 410 individuals, up from an all-time low of about 50. Though the future of the species remains uncertain, for now, at least, they too have found ways to survive.

If the territory behind a clot is well perfused, one could desist from performing a risky thrombectomy maneuver. The arterial pulse pressure curve may serve as an indicator for the collateralization of an occluded target vessel. We investigated the feasibility of arterial pulse measurements with a standard microcatheter.We measured the intra-arterial blood pressure proximal and distal to the clot in 40 thrombectomy maneuvers in a porcine stroke model. We used a microcatheter (Trevo Pro 18, Stryker, Kalamazoo, CA, USA), a pressure transducer (MEMSCAP SP844), an AdInstruments Powerlab 16/35 workstation, and LabChart 8 Software (AdInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand).Median arterial blood pressure proximal and distal to the clot was 96.0 mmHg (IQR, 23.8 mmHg) and 47.5 mmHg (IQR, 43.5 mmHg), respectively (p < .001). The median difference between systolic maximum and diastolic minimum proximal and distal to the clot decreased significantly from 1.8 mmHg (IQR, 3.6 mmHg) to 0.0 mmHg (IQR, 0.5 mmHg) (p < .001). There was loss of the curve in 26 of 40 cases and loss of pressure in 23 of 40 cases (p = .008). There was no significant correlation between vessel diameter and either loss of the pulse pressure curve (p = .20) or overall pressure loss (p = .31).It is possible to measure the pulse pressure proximal and distal to the clot with a standard microcatheter used during mechanical thrombectomy."
