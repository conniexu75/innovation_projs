https://openalex.org/W2763042654,"The class 2 type VI RNA-guided RNA-targeting CRISPR–Cas effector Cas13 can be engineered for RNA knockdown and binding, expanding the CRISPR toolset with a flexible platform for studying RNA in mammalian cells and therapeutic development. CRISPR–Cas prokaryotic defence systems have provided versatile tools for DNA editing. Here, the authors demonstrate that the class 2 type VI RNA-guided RNA-targeting CRISPR–Cas effector Cas13a (previously known as C2c2) can be engineered for RNA knockdown and binding in mammalian cells. This addition to the CRISPR toolbox expands its potential uses to transcript tracking and knockdown. RNA has important and diverse roles in biology, but molecular tools to manipulate and measure it are limited. For example, RNA interference1,2,3 can efficiently knockdown RNAs, but it is prone to off-target effects4, and visualizing RNAs typically relies on the introduction of exogenous tags5. Here we demonstrate that the class 2 type VI6,7 RNA-guided RNA-targeting CRISPR–Cas effector Cas13a8 (previously known as C2c2) can be engineered for mammalian cell RNA knockdown and binding. After initial screening of 15 orthologues, we identified Cas13a from Leptotrichia wadei (LwaCas13a) as the most effective in an interference assay in Escherichia coli. LwaCas13a can be heterologously expressed in mammalian and plant cells for targeted knockdown of either reporter or endogenous transcripts with comparable levels of knockdown as RNA interference and improved specificity. Catalytically inactive LwaCas13a maintains targeted RNA binding activity, which we leveraged for programmable tracking of transcripts in live cells. Our results establish CRISPR–Cas13a as a flexible platform for studying RNA in mammalian cells and therapeutic development."
https://openalex.org/W2764199374,"Mammalian organs vary widely in regenerative capacity. Poorly regenerative organs, such as the heart are particularly vulnerable to organ failure. Once established, heart failure commonly results in mortality. The Hippo pathway, a kinase cascade that prevents adult cardiomyocyte proliferation and regeneration, is upregulated in human heart failure. Here we show that deletion of the Hippo pathway component Salvador (Salv) in mouse hearts with established ischaemic heart failure after myocardial infarction induces a reparative genetic program with increased scar border vascularity, reduced fibrosis, and recovery of pumping function compared with controls. Using translating ribosomal affinity purification, we isolate cardiomyocyte-specific translating messenger RNA. Hippo-deficient cardiomyocytes have increased expression of proliferative genes and stress response genes, such as the mitochondrial quality control gene, Park2. Genetic studies indicate that Park2 is essential for heart repair, suggesting a requirement for mitochondrial quality control in regenerating myocardium. Gene therapy with a virus encoding Salv short hairpin RNA improves heart function when delivered at the time of infarct or after ischaemic heart failure following myocardial infarction was established. Our findings indicate that the failing heart has a previously unrecognized reparative capacity involving more than cardiomyocyte renewal."
https://openalex.org/W2763077107,"The tumour suppressor complex BRCA1-BARD1 functions in the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks by homologous recombination. During this process, BRCA1-BARD1 facilitates the nucleolytic resection of DNA ends to generate a single-stranded template for the recruitment of another tumour suppressor complex, BRCA2-PALB2, and the recombinase RAD51. Here, by examining purified wild-type and mutant BRCA1-BARD1, we show that both BRCA1 and BARD1 bind DNA and interact with RAD51, and that BRCA1-BARD1 enhances the recombinase activity of RAD51. Mechanistically, BRCA1-BARD1 promotes the assembly of the synaptic complex, an essential intermediate in RAD51-mediated DNA joint formation. We provide evidence that BRCA1 and BARD1 are indispensable for RAD51 stimulation. Notably, BRCA1-BARD1 mutants with weakened RAD51 interactions show compromised DNA joint formation and impaired mediation of homologous recombination and DNA repair in cells. Our results identify a late role of BRCA1-BARD1 in homologous recombination, an attribute of the tumour suppressor complex that could be targeted in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2761796839,"Observations from cultured cells, animal models and patients raise the possibility that the dependency of tumours on the therapeutic drugs to which they have acquired resistance represents a vulnerability with potential applications in cancer treatment. However, for this drug addiction trait to become of clinical interest, we must first define the mechanism that underlies it. We performed an unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen on melanoma cells that were both resistant and addicted to inhibition of the serine/threonine-protein kinase BRAF, in order to functionally mine their genome for 'addiction genes'. Here we describe a signalling pathway comprising ERK2 kinase and JUNB and FRA1 transcription factors, disruption of which allowed addicted tumour cells to survive on treatment discontinuation. This occurred in both cultured cells and mice and was irrespective of the acquired drug resistance mechanism. In melanoma and lung cancer cells, death induced by drug withdrawal was preceded by a specific ERK2-dependent phenotype switch, alongside transcriptional reprogramming reminiscent of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In melanoma cells, this reprogramming caused the shutdown of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a lineage survival oncoprotein; restoring this protein reversed phenotype switching and prevented the lethality associated with drug addiction. In patients with melanoma that had progressed during treatment with a BRAF inhibitor, treatment cessation was followed by increased expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, which is associated with the phenotype switch. Drug discontinuation synergized with the melanoma chemotherapeutic agent dacarbazine by further suppressing MITF and its prosurvival target, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), and by inducing DNA damage in cancer cells. Our results uncover a pathway that underpins drug addiction in cancer cells, which may help to guide the use of alternating therapeutic strategies for enhanced clinical responses in drug-resistant cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2763844770,"The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a eukaryotic serine/threonine protein kinase that functions in two distinct complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, to regulate growth and metabolism. GTPases, responding to signals generated by abiotic stressors, nutrients, and, in metazoans, growth factors, play an important but poorly understood role in TORC1 regulation. Here we report that, in budding yeast, glucose withdrawal (which leads to an acute loss of TORC1 kinase activity) triggers a similarly rapid Rag GTPase-dependent redistribution of TORC1 from being semi-uniform around the vacuolar membrane to a single, vacuole-associated cylindrical structure visible by super-resolution optical microscopy. Three-dimensional reconstructions of cryo-electron micrograph images of these purified cylinders demonstrate that TORC1 oligomerizes into a higher-level hollow helical assembly, which we name a TOROID (TORC1 organized in inhibited domain). Fitting of the recently described mammalian TORC1 structure into our helical map reveals that oligomerization leads to steric occlusion of the active site. Guided by the implications from our reconstruction, we present a TOR1 allele that prevents both TOROID formation and TORC1 inactivation in response to glucose withdrawal, demonstrating that oligomerization is necessary for TORC1 inactivation. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which Rag GTPases regulate TORC1 activity and suggest that the reversible assembly and/or disassembly of higher-level structures may be an underappreciated mechanism for the regulation of protein kinases."

https://openalex.org/W2762036550,"Plants interpret their immediate environment through perception of small molecules. Microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) such as flagellin and chitin are likely to be more abundant in the rhizosphere than plant-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). We investigated how the Arabidopsis thaliana root interprets MAMPs and DAMPs as danger signals. We monitored root development during exposure to increasing concentrations of the MAMPs flg22 and the chitin heptamer as well as of the DAMP AtPep1. The tissue-specific expression of defence-related genes in roots was analysed using a toolkit of promoter::YFPN lines reporting jasmonic acid (JA)-, salicylic acid (SA)-, ethylene (ET)- and reactive oxygen species (ROS)- dependent signalling. Finally, marker responses were analysed during invasion by the root pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. The DAMP AtPep1 triggered a stronger activation of the defence markers compared to flg22 and the chitin heptamer. In contrast to the tested MAMPs, AtPep1 induced SA- and JA-signalling markers in the root and caused a severe inhibition of root growth. Fungal attack resulted in a strong activation of defence genes in tissues close to the invading fungal hyphae. The results collectively suggest that AtPep1 presents a stronger danger signal to the Arabidopsis root than the MAMPs flg22 and chitin heptamer."
https://openalex.org/W2762044441,"Aims The UK Biobank is a large-scale population-based study utilising cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to generate measurements of atrial and ventricular structure and function. This study aimed to quantify the association between modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and cardiac morphology and function in individuals without known cardiovascular disease. Methods Age, sex, ethnicity (non-modifiable) and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, smoking status, exercise, body mass index (BMI), high cholesterol, diabetes, alcohol intake (modifiable) were considered important cardiovascular risk factors. Multivariable regression models were built to ascertain the association of risk factors on left ventricular (LV), right ventricular (RV), left atrial (LA) and right atrial (RA) CMR parameters. Results 4,651 participants were included in the analysis. All modifiable risk factors had significant effects on differing atrial and ventricular parameters. BMI was the modifiable risk factor most consistently associated with subclinical changes to CMR parameters, particularly in relation to higher LV mass (+8.3% per SD [4.3 kg/m2], 95% CI: 7.6 to 8.9%), LV (EDV: +4.8% per SD, 95% CI: 4.2 to 5.4%); ESV: +4.4% per SD, 95% CI: 3.5 to 5.3%), RV (EDV: +5.3% per SD, 95% CI: 4.7 to 5.9%; ESV: +5.4% per SD, 95% CI: 4.5 to 6.4%) and LA maximal (+8.6% per SD, 95% CI: 7.4 to 9.7%) volumes. Increases in SBP were associated with higher LV mass (+6.8% per SD, 95% CI: 5.9 to 7.7%), LV (EDV: +4.5% per SD, 95% CI: 3.6 to 5.4%; ESV: +2.0% per SD, 95% CI: 0.8 to 3.3%) volumes. The presence of diabetes or high cholesterol resulted in smaller volumes and lower ejection fractions. Conclusions Modifiable risk factors are associated with subclinical alterations in structure and function in all four cardiac chambers. BMI and systolic blood pressure are the most important modifiable risk factors affecting CMR parameters known to be linked to adverse outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2761578837,"Homologous recombination repairs DNA double-strand breaks and must function even on actively transcribed DNA. Because break repair prevents chromosome loss, the completion of repair is expected to outweigh the transcription of broken templates. However, the interplay between DNA break repair and transcription processivity is unclear. Here we show that the transcription factor GreA inhibits break repair in Escherichia coli. GreA restarts backtracked RNA polymerase and hence promotes transcription fidelity. We report that removal of GreA results in markedly enhanced break repair via the classic RecBCD–RecA pathway. Using a deep-sequencing method to measure chromosomal exonucleolytic degradation, we demonstrate that the absence of GreA limits RecBCD-mediated resection. Our findings suggest that increased RNA polymerase backtracking promotes break repair by instigating RecA loading by RecBCD, without the influence of canonical Chi signals. The idea that backtracked RNA polymerase can stimulate recombination presents a DNA transaction conundrum: a transcription fidelity factor that compromises genomic integrity. In Escherichia coli, the control of RNA polymerase backtracking by transcription elongation factors impairs DNA break repair by affecting RecBCD resection and consequently RecA loading at sites far removed from the original DNA break. The need to repair a broken chromosome should trump any other process occurring on DNA, including transcription. But how does the repair machinery deal with repair in an actively transcribing region? Christophe Herman and colleagues show that in bacteria, backtracking of RNA polymerase facilitates the repair of double-strand breaks. In their model, RecBCD, having loaded at an end, encounters a backtracked complex. Pausing RecBCD at this position activates the RecBCD enzyme in a manner that does not require octameric Chi sequences. The activated enzyme continues to cut away the DNA on the 5 strand and to load the DNA strand exchange factor RecA. However, if the transcription fidelity factor GreA is present, there are fewer backtracked complexes present to provide this alternative route of RecBCD activation."
https://openalex.org/W2761344581,"Even though robotic rehabilitation is very useful to improve motor function, there is no conclusive evidence on its role in reducing post-stroke spasticity. Focal muscle vibration (MV) is instead very useful to reduce segmental spasticity, with a consequent positive effect on motor function. Therefore, it could be possible to strengthen the effects of robotic rehabilitation by coupling MV. To this end, we designed a pilot randomized controlled trial (Clinical Trial NCT03110718) that included twenty patients suffering from unilateral post-stroke upper limb spasticity. Patients underwent 40 daily sessions of Armeo-Power training (1 hour/session, 5 sessions/week, for 8 weeks) with or without spastic antagonist MV. They were randomized into two groups of 10 individuals, which received (group-A) or not (group-B) MV. The intensity of MV, represented by the peak acceleration (a-peak), was calculated by the formula (2πf)2A, where f is the frequency of MV and A is the amplitude. Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), short intracortical inhibition (SICI), and Hmax/Mmax ratio (HMR) were the primary outcomes measured before and after (immediately and 4 weeks later) the end of the treatment. In all patients of group-A, we observed a greater reduction of MAS (p = 0.007, d = 0.6) and HMR (p<0.001, d = 0.7), and a more evident increase of SICI (p<0.001, d = 0.7) up to 4 weeks after the end of the treatment, as compared to group-B. Likewise, group-A showed a greater function outcome of upper limb (Functional Independence Measure p = 0.1, d = 0.7; Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity p = 0.007, d = 0.4) up to 4 weeks after the end of the treatment. A significant correlation was found between the degree of MAS reduction and SICI increase in the agonist spastic muscles (p = 0.004). Our data show that this combined rehabilitative approach could be a promising option in improving upper limb spasticity and motor function. We could hypothesize that the greater rehabilitative outcome improvement may depend on a reshape of corticospinal plasticity induced by a sort of associative plasticity between Armeo-Power and MV."
https://openalex.org/W2762436345,"Viruses express several classes of non-coding RNAs; the functions and mechanisms by which most of these act are unknown. Herpesvirus saimiri, a γ-herpesvirus that establishes latency in the T cells of New World primates and has the ability to cause aggressive leukaemias and lymphomas in non-natural hosts, expresses seven small nuclear uracil-rich non-coding RNAs (called HSURs) in latently infected cells. These HSURs associate with Sm proteins, and share biogenesis and structural features with cellular Sm-class small nuclear RNAs. One of these HSURs (HSUR2) base-pairs with two host cellular microRNAs (miR-142-3p and miR-16) but does not affect their abundance or activity, which suggests that its interactions with them perform alternative functions. Here we show that HSUR2 also base-pairs with mRNAs in infected cells. We combined in vivo psoralen-mediated RNA-RNA crosslinking and high-throughput sequencing to identify the mRNAs targeted by HSUR2, which include mRNAs that encode retinoblastoma and factors involved in p53 signalling and apoptosis. We show that HSUR2 represses the expression of target mRNAs and that base-pairing between HSUR2 and miR-142-3p and miR-16 is essential for this repression, suggesting that HSUR2 recruits these two cellular microRNAs to its target mRNAs. Furthermore, we show that HSUR2 uses this mechanism to inhibit apoptosis. Our results uncover a role for this viral Sm-class RNA as a microRNA adaptor in the regulation of gene expression that follows precursor mRNA processing."
https://openalex.org/W2764223136,"HIV/AIDS remains the second most common cause of death in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), and only 34% of eligible patients in Africa received antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2013. This study investigated the impact of ART decentralization on patient enrollment and retention in rural Malawi. We reviewed electronic medical records of patients registered in the Neno District ART program from August 1, 2006, when ART first became available, through December 31, 2013. We used GPS data to calculate patient-level distance to care, and examined number of annual ART visits and one-year lost to follow-up (LTFU) in HIV care. The number of ART patients in Neno increased from 48 to 3,949 over the decentralization period. Mean travel distance decreased from 7.3 km when ART was only available at the district hospital to 4.7 km when ART was decentralized to 12 primary health facilities. For patients who transferred from centralized care to nearer health facilities, mean travel distance decreased from 9.5 km to 4.7 km. Following a transfer, the proportion of patients achieving the clinic’s recommended ≥4 annual visits increased from 89% to 99%. In Cox proportional hazards regression, patients living ≥8 km from a health facility had a greater hazard of being LTFU compared to patients <8 km from a facility (adjusted HR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.5–1.9). ART decentralization in Neno District was associated with increased ART enrollment, decreased travel distance, and increased retention in care. Increasing access to ART by reducing travel distance is one strategy to achieve the ART coverage and viral suppression objectives of the 90-90-90 UNAIDS targets in rural impoverished areas."
https://openalex.org/W2761427496,"Age is an independent risk factor of multiple organ failure in patients with sepsis. However, the age-related mechanisms of injury are not known. AMPK is a crucial regulator of energy homeostasis, which controls mitochondrial biogenesis by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-α (PGC-1α) and disposal of defective organelles by autophagy. We investigated whether AMPK dysregulation might contribute to age-dependent liver injury in young (2-3 mo) and mature male mice (11-13 mo) subjected to sepsis. Liver damage was higher in mature mice than in young mice and was associated with impairment of hepatocyte mitochondrial function, structure, and biogenesis and reduced autophagy. At molecular analysis, there was a time-dependent nuclear translocation of the active phosphorylated catalytic subunits AMPKα1/α2 and PGC-1α in young, but not in mature, mice after sepsis. Treatment with the AMPK activator 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) improved liver mitochondrial structure in both age groups compared with vehicle. In loss-of-function studies, young knockout mice with systemic deficiency of AMPKα1 exhibited greater liver injury than did wild-type mice after sepsis. Our study suggests that AMPK is important for liver metabolic recovery during sepsis. Although its function may diminish with age, pharmacological activation of AMPK may be of therapeutic benefit.-Inata, Y., Kikuchi, S., Samraj, R. S., Hake, P. W., O'Connor, M., Ledford, J.

Microarray analysis of FMODkd myoblasts and in silico studies were used to identify the top most differentially expressed genes in FMODkd, and helped establish that FMOD-based regulations of integral membrane protein 2a and clusterin are essential components of the myogenic program. Studies in knockout, obese, and diabetic mouse models helped characterize the operation of a novel FMOD-based regulatory circuit that controls myoblast switching from a myogenic to a lipid accumulation fate.

Unlike recombinant CaMKKβ that exhibits higher basal activity (autonomous activity), activation of the CaMKKβ/AMPK signaling pathway requires increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Moreover, the Ca2+/CaM dependence of CaMKKβ appears to arise from multiple phosphorylation events, including autophosphorylation and activities furnished by other protein kinases. However, the effects of proximal downstream kinases on CaMKKβ activity have not yet been evaluated. Here, we demonstrate feedback phosphorylation of CaMKKβ at multiple residues by CaMKKβ-activated AMPK in addition to autophosphorylation in vitro, leading to reduced autonomous, but not Ca2+/CaM-activated, CaMKKβ activity. MS analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of AMPK phosphorylation sites in CaMKKβ indicated that Thr144 phosphorylation by activated AMPK converts CaMKKβ into a Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzyme as shown by completely Ca2+/CaM-dependent CaMKK activity of a phosphomimetic T144E CaMKKβ mutant. CaMKKβ mutant analysis indicated that the C-terminal domain (residues 471–587), including the autoinhibitory region, plays an important role in stabilizing an inactive conformation in a Thr144 phosphorylation–dependent manner. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis with anti-phospho-Thr144 antibody revealed phosphorylation of Thr144 in CaMKKβ in transfected COS-7 cells that was further enhanced by exogenous expression of AMPKα.

https://openalex.org/W2761123924,"Bifunctional glycoside hydrolases have potential for cost-savings in enzymatic decomposition of plant cell wall polysaccharides for biofuels and bio-based chemicals. The N-terminal GH10 domain of a bifunctional multimodular enzyme CbXyn10C/Cel48B from Caldicellulosiruptor bescii is an enzyme able to degrade xylan and cellulose simultaneously. However, the molecular mechanism underlying its substrate promiscuity has not been elucidated. Herein, we discovered that the binding cleft of CbXyn10C would have at least six sugar-binding subsites by using isothermal titration calorimetry analysis of the inactive E140Q/E248Q mutant with xylo- and cello-oligosaccharides. This was confirmed by determining the catalytic efficiency of the wild-type enzyme on these oligosaccharides. The free form and complex structures of CbXyn10C with xylose- or glucose-configured oligosaccharide ligands were further obtained by crystallographic analysis and molecular modeling and docking. CbXyn10C was found to have a typical (β/α)8-TIM barrel fold and salad-bowl shape of GH10 enzymes. In complex structures with xylo-oligosaccharides, seven sugar-binding subsites were found, and many residues responsible for substrate interactions were identified. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that 6 and 10 amino acid residues were key residues for xylan and cellulose hydrolysis, respectively. The most important residues are centered on subsites -2 and -1 near the cleavage site, whereas residues playing moderate roles could be located at more distal regions of the binding cleft. Manipulating the residues interacting with substrates in the distal regions directly or indirectly improved the activity of CbXyn10C on xylan and cellulose. Most of the key residues for cellulase activity are conserved across GH10 xylanases. Revisiting randomly selected GH10 enzymes revealed unreported cellulase activity, indicating that the dual function may be a more common phenomenon than has been expected."
https://openalex.org/W2761552372,"Recently-developed methods that integrate multiple data sources arising from the same ecological processes have typically utilized structured data from well-defined sampling protocols (e.g., capture-recapture and telemetry). Despite this new methodological focus, the value of opportunistic data for improving inference about spatial ecological processes is unclear and, perhaps more importantly, no procedures are available to formally test whether parameter estimates are consistent across data sources and whether they are suitable for integration. Using data collected on the reintroduced brown bear population in the Italian Alps, a population of conservation importance, we combined data from three sources: traditional spatial capture-recapture data, telemetry data, and opportunistic data. We developed a fully integrated spatial capture-recapture (SCR) model that included a model-based test for data consistency to first compare model estimates using different combinations of data, and then, by acknowledging data-type differences, evaluate parameter consistency. We demonstrate that opportunistic data lend itself naturally to integration within the SCR framework and highlight the value of opportunistic data for improving inference about space use and population size. This is particularly relevant in studies of rare or elusive species, where the number of spatial encounters is usually small and where additional observations are of high value. In addition, our results highlight the importance of testing and accounting for inconsistencies in spatial information from structured and unstructured data so as to avoid the risk of spurious or averaged estimates of space use and consequently, of population size. Our work supports the use of a single modeling framework to combine spatially-referenced data while also accounting for parameter consistency."
https://openalex.org/W2762684645,"The emergence, persistence and spread of antibiotic-resistant human pathogenic bacteria heralds a growing global health crisis. Drug-resistant strains of gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are especially dangerous and the medical and economic burden they impose underscore the critical need for finding new antimicrobials. Recent studies have demonstrated that plant-expressed bacteriocins of the colicins family can be efficient antibacterials against all major enteropathogenic strains of E. coli. We extended our studies of colicin-like bacteriocins to pyocins, which are produced by strains of P. aeruginosa for ecological advantage against other strains of the same species. Using a plant-based transient expression system, we expressed six different pyocins, namely S5, PaeM, L1, L2, L3 and one new pyocin, PaeM4, and purified them to homogeneity. Among these pyocins, PaeM4 demonstrated the broadest spectrum of activity by controlling 53 of 100 tested clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. The activity of plant-made pyocins was confirmed in the agar drop, liquid culture susceptibility and biofilm assays, and in the Galleria mellonella animal infection model."

https://openalex.org/W2763431968,"The acylation of lysine residues in superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) has been previously shown to decrease its rate of nucleation and elongation into amyloid-like fibrils linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The chemical mechanism underlying this effect is unclear, i.e. hydrophobic/steric effects versus electrostatic effects. Moreover, the degree to which the acylation might alter the prion-like seeding of SOD1 in vivo has not been addressed. Here, we acylated a fraction of lysine residues in SOD1 with groups of variable hydrophobicity, charge, and conformational entropy. The effect of each acyl group on the rate of SOD1 fibril nucleation and elongation were quantified in vitro with thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence, and we performed 594 iterate aggregation assays to obtain statistically significant rates. The effect of the lysine acylation on the prion-like seeding of SOD1 was assayed in spinal cord extracts of transgenic mice expressing a G85R SOD1–yellow fluorescent protein construct. Acyl groups with >2 carboxylic acids diminished self-assembly into ThT-positive fibrils and instead promoted the self-assembly of ThT-negative fibrils and amorphous complexes. The addition of ThT-negative, acylated SOD1 fibrils to organotypic spinal cord failed to produce the SOD1 inclusion pathology that typically results from the addition of ThT-positive SOD1 fibrils. These results suggest that chemically increasing the net negative surface charge of SOD1 via acylation can block the prion-like propagation of oligomeric SOD1 in spinal cord."

Nine well-trained swimmers performed the two training procedures on separate randomized days. Muscle biopsies from m. triceps brachii and blood samples were collected at three different time points: a) before the intervention (pre), b) immediately after the swimming procedures (post) and c) after 3 h of rest (3 h). Hydroperoxides, creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were quantified from blood samples, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) and the AMPKpTHR172/AMPK ratio were quantified by Western blot analysis. PGC-1α, sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), superoxide-dismutase 2 (SOD2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA levels were also quantified. SIT induced a higher release of LDH (p < 0.01 at all time points) and CK (p < 0.01 at post) than HIHVT, but neither SIT nor HIHVT altered systemic hydroperoxides. Additionally, neither SIRT3 nor SOD2 mRNA levels increased, while PGC-1α transcription increased at 3 h after SIT (p < 0.01) and after HIHVT (p < 0.001). However, PGC-1α protein was higher after HIHVT than after SIT (p < 0.05). Moreover, the AMPKpTHR172/AMPK ratio increased at post after SIT (p < 0.05), whereas this effect was delayed after HIHVT as it increased after 3 h (p < 0.05). In addition, VEGF transcription was higher in response to HIHVT (p < 0.05). In conclusion, SIT induces higher muscular stress than HIHVT without increasing systemic oxidation. In addition, HIHVT may induce more robust oxidative adaptations through PGC-1α and AMPK."

These elements can potentially destabilize the genome by initiating their own replication and reintegration into new sites (retrotransposition). In somatic cells, transcription of L1 elements is repressed by distinct molecular mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, to repress transcription. Under conditions of hypomethylation (e.g. in tumor cells), a window of opportunity for L1 derepression arises, and additional restriction mechanisms become crucial. We recently demonstrated that the microRNA miR-128 represses L1 activity by directly binding to L1 ORF2 RNA. In this study, we tested whether miR-128 can also control L1 activity by repressing cellular proteins important for L1 retrotransposition. We found that miR-128 targets the 3′ UTR of nuclear import factor transportin 1 (TNPO1) mRNA. Manipulation of miR-128 and TNPO1 levels demonstrated that induction or depletion of TNPO1 affects L1 retrotransposition and nuclear import of an L1–ribonucleoprotein complex (using L1-encoded ORF1p as a proxy for L1–ribonucleoprotein complexes). Moreover, TNPO1 overexpression partially reversed the repressive effect of miR-128 on L1 retrotransposition. Our study represents the first description of a protein factor involved in nuclear import of the L1 element and demonstrates that miR-128 controls L1 activity in somatic cells through two independent mechanisms: direct binding to L1 RNA and regulation of a cellular factor necessary for L1 nuclear import and retrotransposition. Repetitive elements, including LINE-1 (L1), comprise approximately half of the human genome. These elements can potentially destabilize the genome by initiating their own replication and reintegration into new sites (retrotransposition). In somatic cells, transcription of L1 elements is repressed by distinct molecular mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, to repress transcription.

Repetitive elements make up approximately half of the mammalian genomes. A substantial portion of repetitive elements are derived from retrotransposons (LTR-containing and non-LTR), which transpose to new chromosomal locations by reverse transcription of the RNA into DNA, followed by integration of the copied DNA into a new chromosomal location. Retrotransposition of these elements in germ cells leads to integration of new retrotransposons in the genomes of progeny, and because there is no mechanism for excision, they accumulate over evolutionary time scales (1Lander E.S.

As a result, multiple mechanisms have evolved to tightly control retrotransposon activity. In germ cells, specific small RNA subtypes (piRNAs) efficiently counteract L1 activity (24Aravin A.A.

In somatic cells, L1 mobilization is potently inhibited by DNA methylation of the L1 promoter (26Tsutsumi Y. Hypomethylation of the retrotransposon LINE-1 in malignancy.Jpn. J. Clin.

The recent discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) has revolutionized our understanding of gene control. miRs exemplify the emerging view that non-coding RNAs may rival proteins in regulatory importance. The majority of the human transcriptome is believed to be under miR regulation, positioning this posttranscriptional control mechanism to regulate many gene pathways (32Ambros V. The functions of animal microRNAs.Nature. 2004; 431: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (9072) Google Scholar, 34Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: genomics, biogenesis, mechanism, and function.Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29549) Google Scholar). miRs function as 21- to 24-nt guides that regulate the expression of mRNAs containing complementary sequences. The mature miR is loaded onto specific Argonaute (Ago) proteins, which are then referred to as a miR-inducing silencing complex (34Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: genomics, biogenesis, mechanism, and function.Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29549) Google Scholar). In animals, partial pairing between a miR and an mRNA target site usually results in reduced protein expression through a variety of mechanisms that involve mRNA degradation and translational repression (35Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15901) Google Scholar, 36Fabian M.R. Sonenberg N. Filipowicz W. Regulation of mRNA translation and stability by microRNAs.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 351-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). The best-characterized feature determining miR target recognition are six nucleotide “seed” sites in the 3′ UTR of mRNA targets, which perfectly complement the 5′ end of the miR (positions 2–7) (35Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15901) Google Scholar). We recently discovered that miR-128 represses the activity of L1 retrotransposons in somatic cells, analogous to the role of piRNAs in germ cells. We found a novel mechanism for this regulation in that miR-128 binds directly to L1 RNA in the ORF2 coding region sequence, resulting in L1 repression (37Hamdorf M. Idica A. Zisoulis D.G. Gamelin L. Martin C. Sanders K.J. Pedersen I.M. miR-128 represses L1 retrotransposition by binding directly to L1 RNA.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, miRs typically are thought to repress multiple cellular mRNAs by binding to homologous target sequences; the proteins of these target mRNAs often work in concert, so miRs can fine-tune specific cellular networks (38Vella M.C. Choi E.Y. Lin S.Y. Reinert K. Slack F.J.

In this study, we explored whether miR-128 also regulates L1 activity in somatic cells by repressing cellular proteins important for its retrotransposition. Here we report that miR-128 significantly represses retrotransposition by targeting the nuclear import factor Transportin-1 (TNPO1). TNPO1, also referred to as Karyopherin-β2 or Importin-β2, acts by binding to diverse nuclear localization sequences, including PY-NLSs (37Hamdorf M. Idica A. Zisoulis D.G. Gamelin L. Martin C.

Commun. 2013; 4: 1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). TNPO1-mediated nuclear import requires RanGTP for cargo delivery into the nucleus (42Twyffels L. Gueydan C. Kruys V. Transportin-1 and Transportin-2: protein nuclear import and beyond.FEBS Lett. 2014; 588: 1857-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and known TNPO1 cargoes include viral, ribosomal, and histone proteins (42Twyffels L.

Cell. Proteomics. 2013; 12: 145-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have determined that miR-128 targets the TNPO1 3′ UTR and represses the expression of TNPO1 mRNA and protein. In addition, we find that TNPO1 facilitates L1 mobilization and that miR-128-induced TNPO1 deficiency represses L1 retrotransposition by inhibiting nuclear import of L1–RNP (using ORF1p as a proxy for L1–RNP complexes). This represents the first description of a cellular host factor likely to be involved in nuclear import of L1. Thus, in summary, we have discovered a dual mechanism by which miR-128 controls L1 mobilization in somatic cells. We recently determined that miR-128 directly targets L1 RNA and represses de novo retrotransposition and integration in somatic cells, including cancer cells, cancer-initiating cells, and iPSCs, which are all characterized by global demethylation and enhanced opportunity for L1 derepression (37Hamdorf M. Idica A. Zisoulis D.G. Gamelin L. Martin C. Sanders K.J. Pedersen I.M. miR-128 represses L1 retrotransposition by binding directly to L1 RNA.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After demonstrating an important role for miR-128 in the control of L1 retrotransposition in a panel of different cell lines and in iPSCs, we wished to further characterize the mechanism(s) of miR-128-induced restriction of L1 mobilization. First we initiated analyses to dissect the direct (L1 RNA) versus potential indirect (cellular factors) effects of miR-128 on L1 retrotransposition. We performed colony formation assays using different variants of a neomycin reporter constructs encoding the full-length L1 mRNA and a retrotransposition indicator cassette. Briefly, one construct consists of a neomycin gene in the antisense orientation relative to a full-length L1 element, which is disrupted by an intron in the sense orientation (supplemental Fig. S1A). The neomycin (neo) protein can be translated into a functional enzyme only after L1 transcription and splicing of the mRNA and reverse transcription followed by integration of the spliced variant into the genome, thus allowing the quantification of cells with new retrotransposition events in culture. In addition, we generated a miR-128–resistant variant of the L1 plasmid by introducing a silent mutation in the miR-128–binding site (in the ORF2 sequence) attenuating miR-128 binding but allowing L1 to retrotranspose (as described in Ref. 37Hamdorf M. Idica A. Zisoulis D.G. Gamelin L. Martin C. Sanders K.J. Pedersen I.M. miR-128 represses L1 retrotransposition by binding directly to L1 RNA.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar; supplemental Fig. S1B). A third variant of the L1 plasmid described in Ref. 44Wei W. Gilbert N. Ooi S.L. Lawler J.F. Ostertag E.M. Kazazian H.H. Boeke J.D. Moran J.V. Human L1 retrotransposition: cis preference versus trans complementation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar encodes an L1 RNA harboring a D702A mutation in the RT domain of the ORF2 protein, rendering the encoded L1 RT-deficient (RT-dead). This plasmid variant was used as a negative control (supplemental Fig. S1C). miR-128, anti-miR-128, or miR control shRNAs were cloned into the pMIR-ZIP plasmid and packaged into high-titer lentiviruses, HeLa cells were transduced and puromycin-selected, and modulation of miR-128 expression levels was verified by miR-specific qRT-PCR (supplemental Fig. S2A). miR-expressing HeLa cell lines were transfected with either the WT, the miR-128-resistant L1 (mutant), or the RT-deficient L1 (RT-dead) neomycin reporter and selected for 14 days with neomycin replenished daily. We verified that the L1 plasmid was introduced into miR-expressing HeLa cells at equal levels by quantifying the levels of a neomycin-expressing construct (supplemental Fig. S2B). We then compared the effect of miR-128 and anti-miR-128 on L1 mobilization with a panel of miR controls (miR-control (miR-control 1), anti-miR-control (miR-control 2), and miR-127, which does not affect L1 retrotransposition (miR-control 3)). In agreement with our previous findings, we observed a significant decrease in the number of neomycin-resistant colonies in cells overexpressing miR-128 and, conversely, a significant increase in neomycin-resistant colonies in anti-miR-128–overexpressing cells (in which endogenously expressed miR-128 is neutralized) relative to HeLa cells with endogenous miR-128 levels, indicating lower versus higher rates of active retrotransposition of WT L1, in cells where miR-128 is either overexpressed or neutralized (Fig. 1A, left panel) (32Ambros V. The functions of animal microRNAs.Nature. 2004; 431: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (9072) Google Scholar). Next, analysis of miR-128 regulation of miR-128-resistant L1 retrotransposition (mutant) was performed to evaluate potential indirect regulation of L1 by miR-128. We found that miR-128 induction significantly repressed mobilization of miR-128–resistant L1 and that miR-128 neutralization by anti-miR-128 significantly enhanced mobilization of miR-128–resistant L1 relative to miR control (Fig. 1A, center panel). Importantly, miR-modulated HeLa cells encoding RT-deficient L1 (RT-dead) resulted in no neomycin-resistant colonies, demonstrating that colonies obtained upon wild-type and miR-128–resistant L1 plasmid transfections and neo selection are the consequence of a round of de novo L1 (Fig. 1A, right panel) (44Wei W. Gilbert N. Ooi S.L. Lawler J.F. Ostertag E.M. Kazazian H.H. Boeke J.D. Moran J.V. Human L1 retrotransposition: cis preference versus trans complementation.Mol. Cell.

Endonuclease-independent LINE-1 retrotransposition at mammalian telomeres.Nature. 2007; 446: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These results support the idea that miR-128 functions through direct binding of L1 RNA and by regulating cellular co-factors on which L1 is dependent for successful mobilization. miRs often exert their regulatory roles of complex cellular functions by repressing multiple targets in the same signaling pathway. Therefore, miRs can be thought of as master RNA regulators, similar to transcription factors, which are DNA regulators. We have employed different strategies to identify miR-128 targets that may work in synergy with direct L1 RNA targeting to limit L1 mobilization. We performed an unbiased screen to validate bioinformatically predicted miR-128 targets by using PicTar and TargetScan (46Carpenter A.E. Jones T.R. Lamprecht M.R. Clarke C. Kang I.H. Friman O.

https://openalex.org/W2762621236,"Leaves are thought to be the primary carbon source for reproduction in plants, so a positive relationship between vegetative size and reproductive output is expected, establishing a trade-off between time to reproduction and reproductive output. A common response to higher temperatures due to climate changes is the induction of earlier transition into reproduction. Thus, in annual plants, earlier transition into flowering can potentially constrain plant size and reduce seed production. However, trade-offs between early reproduction and fitness are not always observed, suggesting mechanisms to escape the constraints of early flowering do exist. Here, we test whether inflorescence photosynthesis contribution to the reproductive output of Arabidopsis thaliana can offset the cost of early reproduction. We followed the development, growth rate and fitness of 15 accessions, and removed all rosette leaves at flowering (prior to the completion of inflorescence development or any fruit production) in half of the plants to determine the ability of inflorescences to maintain fitness in the absence of leaves. Although leaf removal significantly reduced fruit number, seed weight and plant height, even the most severely impacted accessions maintained 35% of their fitness with the inflorescence as the sole photosynthetic organ; and some accessions experienced no reduction in fitness. Differences between accessions in their ability to maintain fitness after leaf removal is best explained by earlier flowering time and the ability to maintain as many or more branches after leaf removal as in the control treatment. Although earlier flowering does constrain plant vegetative size, we found that inflorescence photosynthesis can significantly contribute to seed production, explaining why early flowering plants can maintain high fitness despite a reduction in vegetative size. Thus, plants can be released from the usually assumed trade-offs associated with earlier reproduction, and selection on inflorescence traits can mediate the impact of climate change on phenology."
https://openalex.org/W2763513988,"Protein imaging, allowing a wide variety of biological studies both in vitro and in vivo, is of great importance in modern biology. Protein and peptide tags fused to proteins of interest provide the opportunity to elucidate protein location and functions, detect protein-protein interactions, and measure protein activity and kinetics in living cells. Whereas several tags are suitable for protein imaging in mesophilic organisms, the application of this approach to microorganisms living at high temperature has lagged behind. Archaea provide an excellent and unique model for understanding basic cell biology mechanisms. Here, we present the development of a toolkit for protein imaging in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus islandicus. The system relies on a thermostable protein tag (H5) constructed by engineering the alkylguanine-DNA-alkyl-transferase protein of Sulfolobus solfataricus, which can be covalently labeled using a wide range of small molecules. As a suitable host, we constructed, by CRISPR-based genome-editing technology, a S. islandicus mutant strain deleted for the alkylguanine-DNA-alkyl-transferase gene (Δogt). Introduction of a plasmid-borne H5 gene in this strain led to production of a functional H5 protein, which was successfully labeled with appropriate fluorescent molecules and visualized in cell extracts as well as in Δogt live cells. H5 was fused to reverse gyrase, a peculiar thermophile-specific DNA topoisomerase endowed with positive supercoiling activity, and allowed visualization of the enzyme in living cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of in vivo imaging of any protein of a thermophilic archaeon, filling an important gap in available tools for cell biology studies in these organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2761126449,"Recent reports highlighting the global significance of cryptosporidiosis among children, have renewed efforts to develop control measures. We have optimized the gnotobiotic piglet model of acute diarrhea to evaluate azithromycin (AZR), nitazoxanide (NTZ), or treatment with both against Cryptosporidium hominis, the species responsible for most human cases. Piglets, animals reproducibly clinically susceptible to C. hominis, when inoculated with 106 oocysts, developed acute diarrhea with oocyst excretion in feces within 3 days. Ten day-treatment with recommended doses for children, commencing at onset of diarrhea, showed that treatment with AZR or NTZ relieved symptoms early in the treatment compared with untreated animals. Piglets treated with AZR exhibited no reduction of oocyst excretion whereas treatment with NTZ significantly reduced oocyst shedding early, increasing however after 5 days. While treatment with AZR+NTZ led to considerable symptomatic improvement, it had a modest effect on reducing mucosal injury, and did not completely eliminate oocyst excretion. Doubling the dose of AZR and/or NTZ did not improve the clinical outcome, confirming clinical observations that NTZ is only partially effective in reducing duration of diarrhea in children. This investigation confirms the gnotobiotic piglet as a useful tool for drug evaluation for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in children."

Analysis of time dependent global proteomic adaptations during HF progression offers the potential to gain deeper insights in the disease development and identify new biomarker candidates. Therefore, hearts of TAC (transverse aortic constriction) and sham mice were examined by cardiac MRI on either day 4, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 56 after surgery (n = 6 per group/time point). At each time point, proteomes of the left (LV) and right ventricles (RV) of TAC and sham mice were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). In TAC mice, systolic LV heart function worsened from day 4 to day 14, remained on a stable level from day 14 to day 42, and showed a further pronounced decline at day 56. MS analysis identified in the LV 330 and in RV 246 proteins with altered abundance over time (TAC vs. sham, fc≥±2). Functional categorization of proteins disclosed the time-dependent alteration of different pathways. Heat shock protein beta-7 (HSPB7) displayed differences in abundance in tissue and serum at an early stage of HF. This study not only provides an overview of the time dependent molecular alterations during transition to HF, but also identified HSPB7 as a novel blood biomarker candidate for the onset of cardiac remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2762221163,"The effects of nitrogen (N) deposition, tropospheric ozone (O3) and their interaction were investigated in two Mediterranean tree species, Fraxinus ornus L. (deciduous) and Quercus ilex L. (evergreen), having different leaf habits and resource use strategies. An experiment was conducted under controlled condition to analyse how nitrogen deposition affects the ecophysiological and biochemical traits, and to explore how the nitrogen-induced changes influence the response to O3. For both factors we selected realistic exposures (20 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and 80 ppb h for nitrogen and O3, respectively), in order to elucidate the mechanisms implemented by the plants. Nitrogen addition resulted in higher nitrogen concentration at the leaf level in F. ornus, whereas a slight increase was detected in Q. ilex. Nitrogen enhanced the maximum rate of assimilation and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate regeneration in both species, whereas it influenced the light harvesting complex only in the deciduous F. ornus that was also affected by O3 (reduced assimilation rate and accelerated senescence-related processes). Conversely, Q. ilex developed an avoidance mechanism to cope with O3, confirming a substantial O3 tolerance of this species. Nitrogen seemed to ameliorate the harmful effects of O3 in F. ornus: the hypothesized mechanism of action involved the production of nitrogen oxide as the first antioxidant barrier, followed by enzymatic antioxidant response. In Q. ilex, the interaction was not detected on gas exchange and photosystem functionality; however, in this species, nitrogen might stimulate an alternative antioxidant response such as the emission of volatile organic compounds. Antioxidant enzyme activity was lower in plants treated with both O3 and nitrogen even though reactive oxygen species production did not differ between the treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2761054029,"Background The role of mineral metabolism in mortality among dialysis patients has received increased attention, but some aspects remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic value of serum calcium and phosphate levels for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality in dialysis patients. Methods Patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis were enrolled from a multicenter prospective cohort study in Korea (NCT00931970). The patients were divided into low, normal, and high groups according to their baseline serum calcium or phosphate levels. Cox proportional analysis and a proportional hazards model for the subdistribution of a competing risk were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for the association of serum calcium and phosphate levels with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Time-dependent values of calcium and phosphate were also evaluated to assess the effect of longitudinal change in mineral metabolism parameters on mortality types. Results A total of 3,226 dialysis patients were followed up for a mean of 19.8 ± 8.2 months. Infection was the most common cause of death. Low serum phosphate was significantly associated with all-cause and infection-related death using time-dependent values (HR, 1.43 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06–1.93], P = 0.02, and HR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.02–2.70], P = 0.04, respectively). Low serum phosphate was associated with significantly higher infection-related mortality, especially in patients older than 65 years or on dialysis more than one year or with serum albumin lower than 3.9 g/dL (HR, 2.06 [95% CI, 1.13–3.75], P = 0.02, HR, 2.19 [95% CI, 1.20–4.01], P = 0.01, and HR, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.00–3.13], P = 0.05, respectively). Multinomial logistic regression analysis results suggested that low serum albumin, creatinine, and body mass index correlated with low serum phosphate. Conclusions Low serum phosphate in dialysis patients was an independent risk factor for infection-related death, especially in elderly patients. Persistently low serum phosphate might be a nutritional biomarker to predict increased susceptibility to infection and in turn worse outcomes in dialysis patients."
https://openalex.org/W2763839632,"Type B coxsackievirus (CVB) is a common cause of acute and chronic myocarditis, meningitis and pancreatitis, often leading to heart failure and pancreatic deficiency. The polarization of CD4+ T lymphocytes and their cytokine milieu are key factors in the outcome of CVB-induced diseases. Thus, sensing the virus and driving the adaptive immune response are essential for the establishment of a protective immune response. TLR3 is a crucial virus recognition receptor that confers the host with resistance to CVB infection. In the current study, we found that TLR3 expression in dendritic cells plays a role in their activation upon CVB3 infection in vitro, as TLR3-deficient dendritic cells up-regulate CD80 and CD86 to a less degree than WT cells. Instead, they up-regulated the inhibitory molecule PD-L1 and secreted considerably lower levels of TNF-α and IL-10 and a higher level of IL-23. T lymphocyte proliferation in co-culture with CVB3-infected dendritic cells was increased by TLR3-expressing DCs and other cells. Furthermore, in the absence of TLR3, the T lymphocyte response was shifted toward a Th17 profile, which was previously reported to be deleterious for the host. TLR3-deficient mice were very susceptible to CVB3 infection, with increased pancreatic injury and extensive inflammatory infiltrate in the heart that was associated with uncontrolled viral replication. Adoptive transfer of TLR3+ dendritic cells slightly improved the survival of TLR-deficient mice following CVB3 infection. Therefore, our findings highlight the importance of TLR3 signaling in DCs and in other cells to induce activation and polarization of the CD4+ T lymphocyte response toward a Th1 profile and consequently for a better outcome of CVB3 infection. These data provide new insight into the immune-mediated mechanisms by which CVBs are recognized and cleared in order to prevent the development of myocarditis and pancreatitis and may contribute to the design of therapies for enteroviral infections."
https://openalex.org/W2763556050,"Periodontitis is one of the most common infectious diseases globally that, if untreated, leads to destruction of the tooth supporting tissues and finally results in tooth loss. Evidence shows that standard procedures as mechanical root cleaning could be supported by further treatment options such as locally applied substances. Due to gingival crevicular fluid flow, substances are commonly washed out off the periodontal pockets. The evaluation of administration techniques and the development of local drug releasing devices is thus an important aspect in periodontal research. This study describes the development and examination of a new alginate based, biodegradable and easily applicable drug delivery system for chlorhexidine (CHX). Different micro beads were produced and loaded with CHX and the release profiles were investigated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The in vitro-demonstrated release of CHX from alginate based beads shows comparable releasing characteristics as clinically approved systems. Yet many characteristics of this new delivery system show to be favourable for periodontal therapy. Easy application by injection, low production costs and multifunctional adaptions to patient related specifics may improve the usage in routine care."
https://openalex.org/W2762014426,"We investigated a German Spitz family where the mating of a black male to a white female had yielded three puppies with an unexpected light brown coat color, lightly pigmented lips and noses, and blue eyes. Combined linkage and homozygosity analysis based on a fully penetrant monogenic autosomal recessive mode of inheritance identified a critical interval of 15 Mb on chromosome 3. We obtained whole genome sequence data from one affected dog, three wolves, and 188 control dogs. Filtering for private variants revealed a single variant with predicted high impact in the critical interval in LOC100855460 (XM_005618224.1:c.377+2T>G LT844587.1:c.-45+2T>G). The variant perfectly co-segregated with the phenotype in the family. We genotyped 181 control dogs with normal pigmentation from diverse breeds including 22 unrelated German Spitz dogs, which were all homozygous wildtype. Comparative sequence analyses revealed that LOC100855460 actually represents the 5'-end of the canine OCA2 gene. The CanFam 3.1 reference genome assembly is incorrect and separates the first two exons from the remaining exons of the OCA2 gene. We amplified a canine OCA2 cDNA fragment by RT-PCR and determined the correct full-length mRNA sequence (LT844587.1). Variants in the OCA2 gene cause oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2) in humans, pink-eyed dilution in mice, and similar phenotypes in corn snakes, medaka and Mexican cave tetra fish. We therefore conclude that the observed oculocutaneous albinism in German Spitz is most likely caused by the identified variant in the 5'-splice site of the first intron of the canine OCA2 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2763111384,"Sexually transmitted Chlamydia trachomatis is an extremely common infection and often leads to serious complications including infertility and pelvic inflammatory syndrome. Several broad-spectrum antibiotics are currently used to treat C. trachomatis. Although effective, they also kill beneficial vaginal lactobacilli. Two N-acylhydrazones, CF0001 and CF0002, have been shown previously to inhibit chlamydial growth without toxicity to human cells and Lactobacillus spp. Of particular significance, the rate of random mutation leading to resistance of these inhibitors appears to be extremely low. Here, we report three analogs of CF0001 and CF0002 with significantly stronger inhibitory effects on chlamydiae. Even though the new compounds (termed SF1, SF2 and SF3) displayed slightly decreased inhibition efficiencies for a rare Chlamydia variant selected for CF0001 resistance (Chlamydia muridarum MCR), they completely overcame the resistance when used at concentrations of 75-100 μM. Importantly, SF1, SF2 and SF3 did not shown any toxic effect on lactobacilli, whereas SF3 was also well tolerated by human host cells. An effort to isolate SF3-resistant variants was unsuccessful. By comparison, variants resistant to rifampin or spectinomycin were obtained from smaller numbers of chlamydiae. Our findings suggest that SF3 utilizes an antichlamydial mechanism similar to that of CF0001 and CF0002, and will be more difficult for chlamydiae to develop resistance to, potentially making it a more effective antichlamydial agent."

Previously, we have demonstrated that ErbB4 ICD is posttranslationally modified by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) and functionally interacts with the PIAS3 SUMO E3 ligase. However, direct evidence of SUMO modification in ErbB4 signaling has remained elusive. Here, we report that the conserved lysine residue 714 in the ErbB4 ICD undergoes SUMO modification, which was reversed by sentrin-specific proteases (SENPs) 1, 2, and 5. Although ErbB4 kinase activity was not necessary for the SUMOylation, the SUMOylated ErbB4 ICD was tyrosine phosphorylated to a higher extent than unmodified ErbB4 ICD. Mutation of the SUMOylation site compromised neither ErbB4-induced phosphorylation of the canonical signaling pathway effectors Erk1/2, Akt, or STAT5 nor ErbB4 stability. In contrast, SUMOylation was required for nuclear accumulation of the ErbB4 ICD. We also found that Lys-714 was located within a leucine-rich stretch, which resembles a nuclear export signal, and could be inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, SUMOylation modulated the interaction of ErbB4 with chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1), the major nuclear export receptor for proteins.

Posttranslational modification by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is a sensitive, rapid, and reversible way of modifying protein function. Mammalian cells express five SUMO proteins, SUMO1–5. Although the SUMO2 and SUMO3 are nearly identical, SUMO1 shares only ∼50% amino acid sequence identity with SUMO2/3. The expression of SUMO4 and SUMO5 is limited to specific tissues, and at present little is known about their functions (22Pichler A. Fatouros C. Lee H. Eisenhardt N. SUMO conjugation—a mechanistic view.Biomol. Concepts. 2017; 8: 13-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). SUMO proteins are covalently conjugated to lysine residues of target proteins via a three-step enzymatic reaction involving E1 activating enzyme, E2 conjugating enzyme, and E3 ligating enzyme, which is often a member of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) protein family (23Rytinki M.M. Kaikkonen S. Pehkonen P. Jääskeläinen T. Palvimo J.J. PIAS proteins: Pleiotropic interactors associated with SUMO.Cell. Mol.

Biochem. 2013; 82: 357-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The removal of SUMO is catalyzed by SUMO isopeptidases such as the sentrin-specific protease (SENP) family, making SUMOylation a reversible and highly dynamic process (25Yeh E.T. SUMOylation and de-SUMOylation: Wrestling with life's processes.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8223-8227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The consequences of SUMOylation are diverse and depend on the target protein. Mechanistically, SUMOylation may promote or interfere with protein-protein interactions, or induce conformational changes. Although SUMOylation has been shown to regulate various cellular processes, most SUMO targets are nuclear proteins. For example, activity or stability of many transcription factors, as well as subcellular distribution of proteins that shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, is often regulated by SUMOylation (24Flotho A. Melchior F. Sumoylation: A regulatory protein modification in health and disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 357-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 26Hendriks I.A. D'Souza R.C.J. Yang B. Verlaan-de Vries M. Mann M. Vertegaal A.C.O. Uncovering global SUMOylation signaling networks in a site-specific manner.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 927-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In our previous study, we identified ErbB4 ICD as an interaction partner of PIAS3 SUMO E3 ligase, and showed that ErbB4 ICD was modified by SUMO (27Sundvall M. Korhonen A. Vaparanta K. Anckar J. Halkilahti K. Salah Z. Aqeilan R.I. Palvimo J.J. Sistonen L. Elenius K. Protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) protein promotes SUMOylation and nuclear sequestration of the intracellular domain of ErbB4 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 23216-23226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although PIAS3 promoted the nuclear accumulation of functional ErbB4 ICD, direct evidence of SUMO modification in ErbB4 signaling remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that even though the ErbB4 amino acid sequence contains SUMOylation consensus motifs, ErbB4 was SUMOylated at a non-consensus lysine. The SUMO acceptor lysine was located adjacent to a functional nuclear export sequence, and SUMOylation regulated the nuclear accumulation of ErbB4. ErbB4 SUMOylation was reversed by SENP1, SENP2, and SENP5. Although ErbB4 kinase activity was not necessary for SUMOylation, SUMOylated ErbB4 ICD was highly tyrosine phosphorylated. We also show that the SUMO acceptor lysine regulates RIP-mediated nuclear ErbB4 function in mammary epithelial cells, but not phosphorylation-dependent signaling cascades activated by full-length ErbB4 receptor at the cell surface. Regulated intramembrane proteolysis of cleavable ErbB4 isoforms releases a soluble intracellular domain that can localize in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, or nuclei, and that contains tyrosine kinase activity (18Jones F.E. HER4 Intracellular domain (4ICD) activity in the developing mammary gland and breast cancer.J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2008; 13: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that ErbB4 ICD is posttranslationally modified by SUMO (27Sundvall M. Korhonen A. Vaparanta K. Anckar J. Halkilahti K. Salah Z. Aqeilan R.I. Palvimo J.J. Sistonen L. Elenius K. Protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) protein promotes SUMOylation and nuclear sequestration of the intracellular domain of ErbB4 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 23216-23226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). SUMOylation frequently occurs on a consensus motif ΨKXE, where Ψ is a large hydrophobic residue, and X is any amino acid (24Flotho A. Melchior F. Sumoylation: A regulatory protein modification in health and disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 357-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric screens have also identified an inverted consensus motif, where the acidic residue resides two positions upstream (E/DXKΨ) of the SUMOylated lysine, as well as frequent modification of a shorter KXE motif (26Hendriks I.A. D'Souza R.C.J. Yang B. Verlaan-de Vries M. Mann M. Vertegaal A.C.O. Uncovering global SUMOylation signaling networks in a site-specific manner.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Cell. 2010; 39: 641-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis of the ErbB4 ICD revealed two ΨKXE consensus motifs (PK1143QE and PK1181AE), a shorter KXE motif (GK1202AE) near the C terminus, and an inverted consensus motif DSK1002F adjacent to the kinase domain (Fig. 1A). To examine whether these lysine residues could serve as SUMO acceptor sites, we replaced them with arginines, cotransfected wild-type or lysine to arginine mutant soluble ErbB4 ICDs of CYT-2 type together with His6-tagged SUMO1 to COS-7 cells, and purified SUMOylated proteins using Ni2+-NTA agarose under denaturing conditions to inactivate SUMO proteases (24Flotho A. Melchior F. Sumoylation: A regulatory protein modification in health and disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 357-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Although some ErbB4 nonspecifically bound to Ni2+-NTA agarose, SUMOylated ErbB4 ICD was clearly detected as a slower migrating band of ∼90 kDa (Fig. 1B), corresponding to a single His6-SUMO residue conjugated to the ∼75-kDa ErbB4 ICD. A weaker, ∼100-kDa SUMOylated form of ErbB4 ICD was also detected. However, the replacement of the three C-terminal lysines (K1143R+K1181R+K1202R; Cons 3KR) and the inverted motif lysine (K1002R+K1143R+K1181R+K1202R; Cons 4KR) with arginines had no effect on content of SUMO-modified ErbB4 ICD (Fig. 1B), indicating that the lysine residue/residues targeted by SUMOylation are non-consensus sites. Similar results were obtained in MCF-7 breast cancer cells expressing wild-type or mutant ErbB4 ICD together with His6-tagged SUMO3 (supplemental Fig. S1). A significant proportion of SUMOylated lysines identified in mass spectrometric screens do not match the consensus motif (26Hendriks I.A. D'Souza R.C.J. Yang B. Verlaan-de Vries M. Mann M.

Signal. 2014; 7: rs2Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The selection of a non-consensus SUMOylation site can be dependent on non-covalent interaction of the SUMO-carrying E2 conjugating enzyme with a SUMO interacting motif (SIM) present in a target protein (24Flotho A. Melchior F. Sumoylation: A regulatory protein modification in health and disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 357-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). However, a possibility of SIM-directed SUMOylation was excluded, as the ErbB4 ICD did not interact non-covalently with SUMO1 in a GST pulldown assay, unlike PIASy, which is known to contain a SIM (23Rytinki M.M. Kaikkonen S. Pehkonen P. Jääskeläinen T. Palvimo J.J. PIAS proteins: Pleiotropic interactors associated with SUMO.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 3029-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2). There are in total 39 lysine residues in the ErbB4 ICD sequence. Most of these lysine residues (35/39) are predicted to be solvent-exposed (supplemental Fig. S3; predicted using NetSurfP, www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetSurfP) 5Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. and may thus be available for SUMOylation. Roughly half of them (18/39) are within the predicted kinase domain spanning the residues 718–985 (supplemental Fig. S3). The analysis of ErbB4 deletion constructs indicated that a construct containing the N-terminal region of ErbB4 ICD, which includes the kinase domain, was SUMOylated (supplemental Fig. S4). Interestingly, three lysines in this region (Lys-714, Lys-719, and Lys-722) were located within a leucine-rich sequence 713LKETELKRVKVL724, which is one of the three sequences suggested to resemble a nuclear export signal (NES) (5Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. γ-Secretase cleavage and nuclear localization of ErbB-4 receptor tyrosine kinase.Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). To analyze their role in ErbB4 SUMOylation, we constructed a series of lysine to arginine ErbB4 ICD mutants containing all three (K714R+K719R+K722R) point mutations or single mutations (Fig. 1C), transfected them in COS-7 (Fig. 1D) or MCF-7 (supplemental Fig. S1) cells together with His6-tagged SUMO1 or SUMO3, respectively, and analyzed ErbB4 SUMOylation as in Fig. 1B. Notably, the replacement of Lys-714, Lys-719, and Lys-722 with arginines disrupted the formation of the ∼90-kDa SUMO1- or SUMO3-modified ErbB4 ICD (Fig. 1D; supplemental Fig. S1). Furthermore, K714R mutation alone, but not K719R or K722R, was sufficient to abolish the formation of the ∼90-kDa SUMOylated ErbB4 (Fig. 1, D and E; supplemental Fig. S1). Coexpression of PIAS3, a SUMO E3 ligase previously shown (27Sundvall M. Korhonen A. Vaparanta K. Anckar J. Halkilahti K. Salah Z. Aqeilan R.I. Palvimo J.J. Sistonen L. Elenius K. Protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) protein promotes SUMOylation and nuclear sequestration of the intracellular domain of ErbB4 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 23216-23226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to promote ErbB4 ICD SUMOylation, had no effect on the level of modification of the K714R mutant, but strongly enhanced the SUMOylation of wild-type ErbB4 ICD (Fig. 1F). Upon the replacement of lysine 714 or three lysines 714, 719, and 722 to arginines, higher molecular weight bands of ∼100 kDa were occasionally detected in longer exposure (Fig. 1D; supplemental Fig. S1B), suggesting that other sites could be used for SUMOylation when Lys-714 was not available. These SUMOylated species potentially represented ErbB4 ICD modified to consensus sites, as adding the four consensus site mutations to the same construct inhibited their formation (supplemental Fig. S1B). However, these SUMOylated species were present in smaller quantities compared with the Lys-714–modified ErbB4 ICD and were not always readily detectable. The crystal structure of active ErbB4 kinase domain obtained from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB ID: 3BCE) (32Qiu C. Tarrant M.K. Choi S.H. Sathyamurthy A. Bose R. Banjade S. Pal A. Bornmann W.G. Lemmon M.A. Cole P.A. Leahy D.J. Mechanism of activation and inhibition of the HER4/ErbB4 kinase.Structure. 2008; 16: 460-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) indicated that the region around Lys-714 was nonhelical, and that Lys-714 was exposed and thus accessible to the SUMOylation machinery (Fig. 1G). Furthermore, ErbB4 SUMO modification site is conserved in vertebrates, including mammals, Xenopus tropicalis and Danio rerio (Fig. 1H), suggesting functional importance. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Lys-714 is the major SUMO acceptor site in ErbB4 ICD. SUMOylation is a reversible modification (25Yeh E.T. SUMOylation and de-SUMOylation: Wrestling with life's processes.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8223-8227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To characterize factors negatively regulating ErbB4 SUMOylation, activities of the SENP family of SUMO isopeptidases toward SUMOylated ErbB4 ICD were compared. COS-7 cells were transfected with ErbB4 ICD, together with SENP1 or SENP2, and His6-SUMO1 or His6-SUMO3, or with SENP3, SENP5, SENP6, or SENP7, and His6-SUMO3, according to the SUMO paralog preferences of SENP proteins (25Yeh E.T. SUMOylation and de-SUMOylation: Wrestling with life's processes.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8223-8227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). ErbB4 ICD SUMOylation was analyzed by Ni2+-NTA purification and Western blotting. Both SENP1 and SENP2 could efficiently deconjugate SUMO1 and SUMO3 from ErbB4 ICD (Fig. 2, A and B). DeSUMOylation was dependent on the catalytic activity of SENP1, as mutating the catalytic cysteine to alanine (C603A) abolished its deSUMOylating activity toward ErbB4 ICD (Fig. 2A). Unlike SENP1 and SENP2, which have specificity for all SUMO paralogs, the SUMO2/3-specific SENPs (SENP3, SENP5, SENP6, SENP7) were less potent in reducing the level of SUMO-modified ErbB4 ICD (Fig. 2C). Only SENP5 overexpression resulted in decreased SUMOylation of ErbB4 ICD. These results indicate that ErbB4 ICD SUMOylation is a reversible process and that the deSUMOylation is catalyzed by SENP1, SENP2, and SENP5. qRT-PCR analyses indicated that SENP1 and SENP2 are expressed in breast cancer cell lines representing estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer (supplemental Fig. S5A), a subtype in which ErbB4 is also expressed (33Sundvall M. Iljin K. Kilpinen S. Sara H. Kallioniemi O.-P. Elenius K. Role of ErbB4 in breast cancer.J Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2008; 13: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). SENP5 expression was not detected in our analysis (supplemental Fig. S5A). Our previous results have demonstrated that PIAS3, a SUMO E3 ligase that stimulates SUMOylation of ErbB4, also promotes the nuclear localization of the ICD (27Sundvall M. Korhonen A. Vaparanta K. Anckar J. Halkilahti K. Salah Z. Aqeilan R.I. Palvimo J.J. Sistonen L. Elenius K.

Chem. 2012; 287: 23216-23226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To analyze the role of the major SUMOylation site for nuclear ErbB4 localization and stability in a biologically relevant context, estrogen receptor–positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which naturally express PIAS3 (supplemental Fig. S5B), were chosen as a model. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type or K714R mutant HA-tagged ErbB4 ICD and treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The abundances of the ICDs were analyzed at different time points in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Both wild-type and K714R mutant ErbB4 ICD were detected in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 3A). Compared with wild-type ErbB4 ICD, the abundance of K714R mutant in the nuclear fraction reduced faster over time (Fig. 3, A and B). However, in the cytoplasmic fractions or in the total cell lysates no differences were observed (Fig. 3, A and B; supplemental Fig. S6, A and B). The role of SUMOylation in the nuclear accumulation of ErbB4 ICD was also addressed by reducing SUMO isopeptidase expression using RNA interference. MCF-7 cells were transfected with nontargeting or SENP2 siRNA together with ErbB4 ICD, and subjected to subcellular fractionation. Knockdown of SENP2, which reversed SUMOylation of ErbB4 ICD (Fig. 2B), also promoted the accumulation of ErbB4 ICD specifically in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3, C and D; supplemental Fig. S6, C and D). To assess the effect of the SUMO site mutation on the general stability of full-length ErbB4 receptor at the cell membrane, COS-7 cells were transfected with wild-type or K714R mutant ErbB4 and treated with cycloheximide for different time points. No differences were observed in the stability of wild-type and K714R full-length ErbB4, nor the 75-kDa cleavage product (Fig. 4, A and B). Moreover, the K714R mutant ErbB4 ICD was ubiquitinated to a similar level as wild-type ICD when transfected to MCF-7 cells (supplemental Fig. S7), indicating similar susceptibility to ubiquitin-mediated targeting to proteasomes (34Komander D. Rape M. The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that SUMOylation at Lys-714 regulates accumul"
https://openalex.org/W2761160254,"Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer and presents a significant health care burden in many countries. In addition to ultraviolet radiation in sunlight, the main causal factor for melanoma, genetic factors also play an important role in melanoma susceptibility. Although genome-wide association studies have identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with melanoma, little is known about the proportion of disease risk attributable to these loci and their distribution throughout the genome. Here, we investigated the genetic architecture of melanoma in 1,888 cases and 990 controls of European non-Hispanic ancestry. We estimated the overall narrow-sense heritability of melanoma to be 0.18 (P < 0.03), indicating that genetics contributes significantly to the risk of sporadically-occurring melanoma. We then demonstrated that only a small proportion of this risk is attributable to known risk variants, suggesting that much remains unknown of the role of genetics in melanoma. To investigate further the genetic architecture of melanoma, we partitioned the heritability by chromosome, minor allele frequency, and functional annotations. We showed that common genetic variation contributes significantly to melanoma risk, with a risk model defined by a handful of genomic regions rather than many risk loci distributed throughout the genome. We also demonstrated that variants affecting gene expression in skin account for a significant proportion of the heritability, and are enriched among melanoma risk loci. Finally, by incorporating skin color into our analyses, we observed both a shift in significance for melanoma-associated loci and an enrichment of expression quantitative trait loci among melanoma susceptibility variants. These findings suggest that skin color may be an important modifier of melanoma risk. We speculate that incorporating skin color and other non-genetic factors into genetic studies may allow for an improved understanding of melanoma susceptibility and guide future investigations to identify melanoma risk genes."
https://openalex.org/W2764216485,"Status signals allow competitors to assess each other’s resource holding potential and reduce the occurrence of physical fights. Because status signals function to mediate competition over resources, a change in the strength of competition may affect the utility of a status signaling system. Status signals alter competitor behavior during periods of high competition, and thus determine access to resources; however, when competition is reduced, we expect these signals to become disassociated from access to resources. We investigated seasonal changes in status signaling of the male black-crested titmouse (Baeolophus atricristatus), a species that experiences substantial changes in population density and competition for food over the annual cycle. We compared the size of the prominent head-crest to foraging success at community-used feeding stations; we tested this relationship when competition was seasonally high, and when competition was seasonally low. We then experimentally decreased the number of feeders to increase competition (during the season of low-competition), and again tested whether male crest size predicted access to feeders. When competition was seasonally high, males with longer crests had greater access to feeders, but this pattern was not apparent when competition was seasonally low. When competition was experimentally increased, males with longer crests were again more successful at maintaining access to feeders. These findings provide evidence of a context-dependent status signaling system, where the status signal only mediates access to resources during periods of high competition. We discuss possible hypotheses for why the signaling system may not be functional, or detectable, during periods of low competition, including that competitors may interact less frequently and so have reduced opportunity for signaling, or that status signals are disregarded by receivers during periods of low competition because signalers are unlikely to escalate a contest into a fight. In any case, these results indicate that resource availability affects a status signaling system, and that the potential for status signaling persists in this system between seasons, even though such signaling may not be overtly present or detectable during periods of low competition."

Such evidence has motivated efforts to identify mechanisms that regulate RGS2 expression or function, which could provide new insight into disease pathogenesis or novel targets for therapeutic development. Among such mechanisms, proteolytic degradation of RGS2 may be particularly important. RGS2 protein half-life is short (∼30 min) because of ubiquitin- and proteasome-mediated proteolysis (35Bodenstein J. Sunahara R.K. Neubig R.R. N-terminal residues control proteasomal degradation of RGS2, RGS4, and RGS5 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells.Mol.

Wadas B. Kim S.-Y. Varshavsky A. Hwang C.-S. Control of mammalian G protein signaling by N-terminal acetylation and the N-end rule pathway.Science. 2015; 347: 1249-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Targeting this process has therapeutic potential because cardiotonic steroids such as digoxin inhibit RGS2 degradation and protect in mouse models against cardiac injury in an RGS2-dependent manner (38Sjögren B. Parra S. Atkins K.B. Karaj B. Neubig R.R. Digoxin-mediated upregulation of RGS2 protein protects against cardiac injury.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2016; 357: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mechanisms that mediate proteolytic degradation of RGS2 are complex. One mechanism is the acetylated N-end (Ac/N) rule pathway involving the identity of the amino acid at position 2 in RGS2, the N-recognin TEB4 (MARCH6), and the N-terminal acetylase Naa60 (37Park S.-E. Kim J.-M. Seok O.-H. Cho H. Wadas B. Kim S.-Y. Varshavsky A. Hwang C.-S. Control of mammalian G protein signaling by N-terminal acetylation and the N-end rule pathway.Science. 2015; 347: 1249-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, other mechanisms have been implicated because RGS2 degradation also requires a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex (CUL4B/DDB1/FBXO44) unlinked to the N-end rule pathway (36Sjögren B. Swaney S. Neubig R.R. FBXO44-mediated degradation of RGS2 protein uniquely depends on a cullin 4B/DDB1 complex.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0123581Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). RGS2 degradation is a regulated process, as indicated by the inhibitory effects of cardiotonic steroids (38Sjögren B. Parra S. Atkins K.B. Karaj B. Neubig R.R.

Pharmacol. 2014; 86: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), or a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) inhibitor (41Osei-Owusu P. Sun X. Drenan R.M. Steinberg T.H. Blumer K.J.

Chem. 2007; 282: 31656-31665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Whether such effects occur by targeting recognition of RGS2 by the Ac/N-end rule and/or CUL4B/DDB1/FBXO44 pathways is unknown. Less well-understood is how proteolytic degradation of RGS2 affects GPCR signaling. A rapidly proteolyzed hypertension-associated RGS2 mutant (Q2L) exhibits reduced function (35Bodenstein J. Sunahara R.K. Neubig R.R. N-terminal residues control proteasomal degradation of RGS2, RGS4, and RGS5 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells.Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 1040-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but whether this effect occurs by proteolytic degradation or other mechanisms has not been established. Similarly, although knock down of Ac/N-end rule components blunts RGS2 proteolysis and enhances inhibition of Gq-mediated ERK activation (37Park S.-E. Kim J.-M. Seok O.-H. Cho H. Wadas B. Kim S.-Y. Varshavsky A. Hwang C.-S. Control of mammalian G protein signaling by N-terminal acetylation and the N-end rule pathway.Science. 2015; 347: 1249-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whether this effect on cell signaling occurs specifically by inhibiting proteolytic degradation of RGS2 as opposed to other molecules is unclear. Moreover, whereas knockdown of the CUL4B/DBB1/FBXO44 complex inhibits RGS2 degradation (36Sjögren B. Swaney S. Neubig R.R. FBXO44-mediated degradation of RGS2 protein uniquely depends on a cullin 4B/DDB1 complex.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0123581Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), its effect on GPCR signaling was not investigated. Lastly, whether RGS2 proteolysis regulates GPCR signaling amplitude, kinetics, desensitization, or resensitization has not been studied. Here our goals were to determine how RGS2 is targeted for ubiquitin- and proteasome-mediated degradation and to establish how Gq/11-mediated GPCR signaling is regulated by RGS2 proteolysis. Rather than knocking down components of the N-end rule or other pathways, which could have pleiotropic effects on cell signaling, we have used a structure-function approach to identify and characterize degradation signals in RGS2. By analyzing RGS2 mutants that degrade faster or more slowly than the wild-type protein and assessing the impact of proteasome inhibition, we have identified novel degradation signals and provided direct evidence indicating that proteolytic degradation of RGS2 regulates the amplitude and dynamics of Gq/11-mediated GPCR signaling. Because N-terminal acetylation and the identity of the amino acid at position 2 in RGS2 are the only features of this protein shown thus far to affect proteolytic degradation, our first goal was to conduct a more comprehensive identification of motifs or domains that are necessary and sufficient for RGS2 proteolysis. Our approach was guided by the domain structure of RGS2, a 211-residue protein containing an ∼80-residue N-terminal region, followed by the RGS domain that is necessary and sufficient for GAP activity, and a short C-terminal tail (Fig. 1A). We began by studying the degradation rates of RGS2 translated from four previously identified alternative in-frame initiation sites at methionine 1, 5, 16, and 33 (Met-1, Met-5, Met-16, Met-33) (Fig. 1, A and B) (31Roy A.A.

Haemost. 2010; 8: 1594-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and to explore the role of the N-terminal region. Which of these alternative translation products are expressed endogenously in cells or tissues remains unclear because of low expression, rapid degradation, or limitations of antibodies used for detection. Regardless, the N-end rule machinery is predicted to recognize each of these alternative translation products based on the identity of the amino acid residue immediately following the initiating methionine (i.e. Gln-2, Phe-6, Asp-17, Lys-34) (45Tasaki T. Sriram S.M. Park K.S. Kwon Y.T. The N-end rule pathway.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 261-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To study RGS2 degradation, we tagged the protein at its C terminus with three copies of the FLAG epitope (RGS2(3xFLAG)), which preserves function (see below). To simplify analysis, single translation products initiated only at methionine 1, 5, 16, or 33 were produced by changing other alternative in-frame start sites to leucine codons. Degradation rates of RGS2(3xFLAG) initiated at single translation start sites were determined by quantitative immunoblotting of transfected HEK 293 cell lysates harvested over time after inhibiting new protein synthesis with cycloheximide (CHX) (Fig. 1C), and by pulse-chase labeling experiments. 3S. M. Kanai and K. J. Blumer, unpublished data. Results indicated that RGS2 initiated at methionine 1 or 5 was degraded more rapidly than RGS2 initiated at methionine 16 or 33 (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that a motif between methionine 5 and 16 promotes RGS2 degradation. To test this hypothesis, we generated small internal deletions in RGS2(3xFLAG) initiated at methionine 1 (Met-1–RGS2(3xFLAG)) (Fig. 2A) and analyzed their effects on degradation rates following CHX treatment. Deletion of residues 5–9 impaired RGS2 degradation whereas removing residues 8–12 or 10–15 had insignificant effect (Fig. 2, B and C), suggesting that the former deletion disrupted an internal degradation-promoting motif. This result also suggested that the N-terminal residue of RGS2 is not the sole determinant of proteolysis because the Δ5–9 mutant still contains a glutamine residue at position 2, which is hypothesized to promote degradation by the Ac/N-end rule. Features of the degradation-promoting motif in residues 5–9 were identified by point mutagenesis of Met-1–RGS2(3xFLAG). Because this region lacks charged or polar residues, its hydrophobic character may be functionally important. Indeed, substituting residues 6 or 7 with aspartic acid (Fig. 2D) markedly impaired degradation of Met-1–RGS2(3xFLAG) (Fig. 2, E and F), whereas an aspartic acid substitution at position 9 had insignificant effect (Fig. 2, E and F). In contrast, the specific amino acid sequence of this hydrophobic region was unimportant because scrambling its sequence (Fig. 2G) did not affect degradation kinetics (Fig. 2, H and I). Therefore, degradation of RGS2 requires a motif composed of hydrophobic residues near the N terminus. Whereas the preceding results indicated that proteolytic degradation of wild-type RGS2 is not determined solely by the amino acid at position 2 according to the Ac/N-end rule, degradation of the hypertension-associated missense mutant (RGS2-Q2L) (5Yang J. Kamide K. Kokubo Y. Takiuchi S. Tanaka C. Banno M. Miwa Y. Yoshii M. Horio T. Okayama A. Tomoike H. Kawano Y. Miyata T.

Hypertens. 2009; 22: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) nevertheless may be determined mainly by this mechanism because of the presence of a destabilizing leucine residue at position 2. We tested this hypothesis by determining the rate that Met-1–RGS2–Q2L(3xFLAG) is degraded in HEK 293 cells when residues 5–9 were deleted or the hydrophobic character of this region was disrupted by an F6D substitution (Fig. 3A). Results showed that the degradation of Met-1–RGS2–Q2L(3xFLAG) is strikingly impaired by either the Δ5–9 or F6D mutation (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating that the proteolytic degradation of this hypertension-associated form of RGS2 also requires this internal hydrophobic motif.

Our study examined the expression of Slit2 and its receptor, Robo1, in a rat model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes and in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy.Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats via a single, intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. The rats were sacrificed 1, 3 or 6 months after the injection. The expression of Slit2 and Robo1 in retinal tissue was measured by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and protein levels were measured by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Recombinant N-Slit2 protein was used to study the effects of Slit2 on the expression of VEGF in vivo. The concentration of Slit2 protein in human eyes was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 27 eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and 28 eyes in control group. The expression of Slit2, Robo1 and VEGF in the excised human fibrovascular membranes was examined by fluorescence immunostaining and semi-quantitative RT-PCR.The expression of Slit2 and Robo1 in the retina was altered after STZ injection. Recombinant N-Slit2 protein did not increase the retinal VEGF expression. Vitreous concentrations of Slit2 were significantly higher in the study group than in the control group. In the human fibrovascular membranes of the study group, the co-localization of VEGF with the markers for Slit2 and Robo1was observed. The expression of Slit2 mRNA, Robo1 mRNA, and VEGF mRNA was significantly higher in human fibrovascular proliferative diabetic retinopathy membranes than in the control membranes.The alteration of Slit2 and Robo1 expression in the retinas of diabetic rats and patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy suggests a role for the Slit-Robo signal in the various stages diabetic retinopathy. Further studies should address the possible involvement of the Slit-Robo signal in the pathophysiological progress of diabetic retinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2763667496,"Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) is a cell adhesion protein involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration. Interestingly, several PECAM-1–deficient hematopoietic cells exhibit impaired chemotactic responses to stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), a chemokine essential for B lymphopoiesis and bone marrow myelopoiesis. However, whether PECAM-1 is involved in SDF-1–regulated chemotaxis is unknown. We report here that SDF-1 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 at its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs in several hematopoietic cell lines via the Src family kinase Lyn, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase, and JAK2 and that inhibition of these kinases reduced chemotaxis. Overexpression and knockdown of PECAM-1 enhanced and down-regulated, respectively, SDF-1–induced Gαi-dependent activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway and small GTPase Rap1 in hematopoietic 32Dcl3 cells, and these changes in activation correlated with chemotaxis. Furthermore, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway or Rap1, respectively, revealed that these pathways are independently activated and required for SDF-1–induced chemotaxis. When coexpressed in 293T cells, PECAM-1 physically associated with the SDF-1 receptor CXCR4. Moreover, PECAM-1 overexpression and knockdown reduced and enhanced SDF-1–induced endocytosis of CXCR4, respectively. Furthermore, when expressed in 32Dcl3 cells, an endocytosis-defective CXCR4 mutant, CXCR4-S324A/S325A, could activate the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway as well as Rap1 and induce chemotaxis in a manner similar to PECAM-1 overexpression. These findings suggest that PECAM-1 enhances SDF-1–induced chemotaxis by augmenting and prolonging activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway and Rap1 and that PECAM-1, at least partly, exerts its activity by inhibiting SDF-1–induced internalization of CXCR4.

https://openalex.org/W2762043308,"In the coal mining process, the destabilization of loaded coal mass is a prerequisite for coal and rock dynamic disaster, and surface cracks of the coal and rock mass are important indicators, reflecting the current state of the coal body. The detection of surface cracks in the coal body plays an important role in coal mine safety monitoring. In this paper, a method for detecting the surface cracks of loaded coal by a vibration failure process is proposed based on the characteristics of the surface cracks of coal and support vector machine (SVM). A large number of cracked images are obtained by establishing a vibration-induced failure test system and industrial camera. Histogram equalization and a hysteresis threshold algorithm were used to reduce the noise and emphasize the crack; then, 600 images and regions, including cracks and non-cracks, were manually labelled. In the crack feature extraction stage, eight features of the cracks are extracted to distinguish cracks from other objects. Finally, a crack identification model with an accuracy over 95% was trained by inputting the labelled sample images into the SVM classifier. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a higher accuracy than the conventional algorithm and can effectively identify cracks on the surface of the coal and rock mass automatically."
https://openalex.org/W2762800237,"The gut microbiotas of cockroaches and termites play important roles in the symbiotic digestion of dietary components, such as lignocellulose. Diet has been proposed as a primary determinant of community structure within the gut, acting as a selection force to shape the diversity observed within this ""bioreactor"", and as a key factor for the divergence of the termite gut microbiota from the omnivorous cockroach ancestor. The gut microbiota in most termites supports primarily the breakdown of lignocellulose, but the fungus-farming sub-family of higher termites has become similar in gut microbiota to the ancestral omnivorous cockroaches. To assess the importance of a fungus diet as a driver of community structure, we compare community compositions in the guts of experimentally manipulated Pycnoscelus surinamensis cockroaches fed on fungus cultivated by fungus-farming termites. MiSeq amplicon analysis of gut microbiotas from 49 gut samples showed a step-wise gradient pattern in community similarity that correlated with an increase in the proportion of fungal material provided to the cockroaches. Comparison of the taxonomic composition of manipulated communities to that of gut communities of a fungus-feeding termite species showed that although some bacteria OTUs shared by P. surinamensis and the farming termites increased in the guts of cockroaches on a fungal diet, cockroach communities remained distinct from those of termites. These results demonstrate that a fungal diet can play a role in structuring gut community composition, but at the same time exemplifies how original community compositions constrain the magnitude of such change."

https://openalex.org/W2762015897,"Following escape into the cytoplasm of host cells, Burkholderia pseudomallei and the related species Burkholderia thailandensis employ the type VI secretion system 5 (T6SS-5) to induce plasma membrane fusion with an adjacent host cell. This process leads to the formation of multinucleated giant cells and facilitates bacterial access to an uninfected host cell in a direct manner. Despite its importance in virulence, the mechanism of the T6SS-5 and the role of host cell factors in cell-cell fusion remain elusive. To date, the T6SS-5 is the only system of bacterial origin known to induce host-cell fusion. To gain insight into the nature of T6SS-5-stimulated membrane fusion, we investigated the contribution of cholesterol and proteins exposed on the host cell surface, which were shown to be critically involved in virus-mediated giant cell formation. In particular, we analyzed the effect of host cell surface protein and cholesterol depletion on the formation of multinucleated giant cells induced by B. thailandensis. Acute protease treatment of RAW264.7 macrophages during infection with B. thailandensis followed by agarose overlay assays revealed a strong reduction in the number of cell-cell fusions compared with EDTA treated cells. Similarly, proteolytic treatment of specifically infected donor cells or uninfected recipient cells significantly decreased multinucleated giant cell formation. Furthermore, modulating host cell cholesterol content by acute cholesterol depletion from cellular membranes by methyl- β-cyclodextrin treatment or exogenous addition of cholesterol impaired the ability of B. thailandensis to induce cell-cell fusions. The requirement of physiological cholesterol levels suggests that the membrane organization or mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer influence the fusion process. Altogether, our data suggest that membrane fusion induced by B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis involves a complex interplay between the T6SS-5 and the host cell."
https://openalex.org/W2761019615,"In maize (Zea mays), leaf senescence acts as a nutrient recycling process involved in proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids degradation and transport to the developing sink. However, the molecular mechanisms of pre-maturation associated with pollination-prevention remain unclear in maize. To explore global gene expression changes during the onset and progression of senescence in maize, the inbred line 08LF, with severe early senescence caused by pollination prevention, was selected. Phenotypic observation showed that the onset of leaf senescence of 08LF plants occurred approximately 14 days after silking (DAS) by pollination prevention. Transcriptional profiling analysis of the leaf at six developmental stages during induced senescence revealed that a total of 5,432 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 2314 up-regulated genes and 1925 down-regulated genes. Functional annotation showed that the up-regulated genes were mainly enriched in multi-organism process and nitrogen compound transport, whereas down-regulated genes were involved in photosynthesis. Expression patterns and pathway enrichment analyses of early-senescence related genes indicated that these DEGs are involved in complex regulatory networks, especially in the jasmonic acid pathway. In addition, transcription factors from several families were detected, particularly the CO-like, NAC, ERF, GRAS, WRKY and ZF-HD families, suggesting that these transcription factors might play important roles in driving leaf senescence in maize as a result of pollination-prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2760961406,"The two highly homologous non-visual arrestins, beta-arrestin 1 and 2, are ubiquitously expressed in the central nervous system, yet knowledge of their disparate roles is limited. While beta-arrestin 2 (βarr2) has been implicated in several aspects of reward-related learning and behavior, very little is known about the behavioral function of beta-arrestin 1 (βarr1). Using mice lacking βarr1, we focused on the role of this scaffolding and signal transduction protein in reward-motivated behaviors and in striatal glutamatergic function. We found that βarr1 KO mice were both slower in acquiring cocaine self-administration and in extinguishing this behavior. They also showed deficits in learning tasks supported by a natural food reward, suggesting a general alteration in reward processing. We then examined glutamatergic synaptic strength in WT and KO medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) shell in naive animals, and from those that underwent cocaine self-administration. An increase in the AMPA/NMDA (A/N) ratio and a relative lack of GluN2B-enriched NMDARs was found in naive KO vs WT MSNs. Applying Lim Domain Kinase (LIMK1), the kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin, to these cells, showed that both βarr1 and LIMK regulate the A/N ratio and GluN2B-NMDARs. Cocaine self-administration increased the A/N ratio and GluN2B-NMDARs in WT MSNs and, although the A/N ratio also increased in KO MSNs, this was accompanied by fewer GluN2B-NMDARs and an appearance of calcium-permeable AMPARs. Finally, to examine the consequences of reduced basal GluN2B-NMDARs in reward-processing seen in KO mice, we chronically infused ifenprodil, a GluN2B antagonist, into the NAc shell of WT mice. This intervention substantially reduced food-motivated behavior. Together these findings identify a previously unknown role of βarr1 in regulating specific reward-motivated behaviors and glutamatergic function."

https://openalex.org/W2763927234,"Understanding the factors leading each stakeholder to participate in an experimental trial is a key element for improving trial set-up and for identifying selection bias in statistical analyses. An experimental protocol, validated by the European Commission, was developed in France to assess the ability of the gamma-interferon test in terms of accuracy to replace the second intradermal skin test in cases of suspected bovine tuberculosis. Implemented between 2013 and 2015, this experimental trial was based on voluntary participation. To determine and understand the motivation or reluctance of farmers to take part in this trial, we carried out a sociological survey in France. Our study was based on semi-structured interviews with the farmers and other stakeholders involved. The analysis of findings demonstrated that shortening the lock-up period during tuberculosis suspicion, following the use of a gamma-interferon test, was an important aim and a genuine challenge for the animal health stakeholders. However, some farmers did not wish to continue the trial because it could potentially have drastic consequences for them. Moreover, misunderstandings and confusion concerning the objectives and consequences of the trial led stakeholders to reject it forcefully. Based on our results, we offer some recommendations: clear and appropriate communication tools should be prepared to explain the protocol and its aims. In addition, these types of animal health trials should be designed with the stakeholders' interests in mind. This study provides a better understanding of farmer motivations and stakeholder influences on trial participation and outcomes. The findings can be used to help design trials so that they promote participation by farmers and by all animal health stakeholders in general."
