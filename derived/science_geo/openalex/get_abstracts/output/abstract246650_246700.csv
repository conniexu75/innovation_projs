https://openalex.org/W2103503670,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in 2002 to 2003 in southern China. The origin of its etiological agent, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), remains elusive. Here we report that species of bats are a natural host of coronaviruses closely related to those responsible for the SARS outbreak. These viruses, termed SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs), display greater genetic variation than SARS-CoV isolated from humans or from civets. The human and civet isolates of SARS-CoV nestle phylogenetically within the spectrum of SL-CoVs, indicating that the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak was a member of this coronavirus group."
https://openalex.org/W1978476682,"When we fall asleep, consciousness fades yet the brain remains active. Why is this so? To investigate whether changes in cortical information transmission play a role, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation together with high-density electroencephalography and asked how the activation of one cortical area (the premotor area) is transmitted to the rest of the brain. During quiet wakefulness, an initial response (∼15 milliseconds) at the stimulation site was followed by a sequence of waves that moved to connected cortical areas several centimeters away. During non–rapid eye movement sleep, the initial response was stronger but was rapidly extinguished and did not propagate beyond the stimulation site. Thus, the fading of consciousness during certain stages of sleep may be related to a breakdown in cortical effective connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1988825409,"Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone for many signal transducers and may influence evolution by releasing previously silent genetic variation in response to environmental change. In fungi separated by ∼800 million years of evolution, Hsp90 potentiated the evolution of drug resistance in a different way, by enabling new mutations to have immediate phenotypic consequences. Resistance was abrogated by Hsp90 inhibitors and by febrile temperatures, suggesting new therapeutic strategies and a clinical benefit of fever. During selection in a human host, drug resistance that was initially Hsp90-dependent evolved toward independence. Thus, Hsp90 can act in diverse ways to couple environmental contingency to the emergence and fixation of new traits."

Using this technique, we found that stimulation of the right inferior parietal lobule or the caudal superior temporal gyrus, but not of its rostral portion, determined rightward deviations on line bisection. However, the strongest shifts occurred with subcortical stimulation. Fiber tracking identified the stimulated site as a section of the superior occipitofrontal fasciculus, a poorly known parietal-frontal pathway. These findings suggest that parietal-frontal communication is necessary for the symmetrical processing of the visual scene."

https://openalex.org/W2059337036,"Monocular deprivation normally alters ocular dominance in the visual cortex only during a postnatal critical period (20 to 32 days postnatal in mice). We find that mutations in the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) affect cessation of ocular dominance plasticity. In NgR –/– mice, plasticity during the critical period is normal, but it continues abnormally such that ocular dominance at 45 or 120 days postnatal is subject to the same plasticity as at juvenile ages. Thus, physiological NgR signaling from myelin-derived Nogo, MAG, and OMgp consolidates the neural circuitry established during experience-dependent plasticity. After pathological trauma, similar NgR signaling limits functional recovery and axonal regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2170420479,"Colloidal particles or nanoparticles, with equal affinity for two fluids, are known to adsorb irreversibly to the fluid-fluid interface. We present large-scale computer simulations of the demixing of a binary solvent containing such particles. The newly formed interface sequesters the colloidal particles; as the interface coarsens, the particles are forced into close contact by interfacial tension. Coarsening is markedly curtailed, and the jammed colloidal layer seemingly enters a glassy state, creating a multiply connected, solidlike film in three dimensions. The resulting gel contains percolating domains of both fluids, with possible uses as, for example, a microreaction medium."

https://openalex.org/W2163839853,"Chlorinated natural products include vancomycin and cryptophycin A. Their biosynthesis involves regioselective chlorination by flavin-dependent halogenases. We report the structural characterization of tryptophan 7-halogenase (PrnA), which regioselectively chlorinates tryptophan. Tryptophan and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are separated by a 10 angstrom–long tunnel and bound by distinct enzyme modules. The FAD module is conserved in halogenases and is related to flavin-dependent monooxygenases. On the basis of biochemical studies, crystal structures, and by analogy with monooxygenases, we predict that FADH 2 reacts with O 2 to make peroxyflavin, which is decomposed by Cl – . The resulting HOCl is guided through the tunnel to tryptophan, where it is activated to participate in electrophilic aromatic substitution."
https://openalex.org/W1992748149,"In Wolfram syndrome, a rare form of juvenile diabetes, pancreatic β-cell death is not accompanied by an autoimmune response. Although it has been reported that mutations in the WFS1 gene are responsible for the development of this syndrome, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying β-cell death caused by the WFS1 mutations remain unknown. Here we report that WFS1 is a novel component of the unfolded protein response and has an important function in maintaining homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in pancreatic β-cells. WFS1 encodes a transmembrane glyco-protein in the ER. WFS1 mRNA and protein are induced by ER stress. The expression of WFS1 is regulated by inositol requiring 1 and PKR-like ER kinase, central regulators of the unfolded protein response. WFS1 is normally up-regulated during insulin secretion, whereas inactivation of WFS1 in β-cells causes ER stress and β-cell dysfunction. These results indicate that the pathogenesis of Wolfram syndrome involves chronic ER stress in pancreatic β-cells caused by the loss of function of WFS1.

Wagener H.P. Mayo Clin. Proc. 1938; 1: 715-718Google Scholar) analyzed four siblings with the combination of juvenile diabetes and optic atrophy, thus providing the first report of Wolfram syndrome. Because a significant portion of patients with Wolfram syndrome develop diabetes insipidus and auditory nerve deafness, this syndrome is also referred to as the diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness syndrome (2Barrett T.G.

Imbalance in ER homeostasis elicits stress in this organelle. ER stress is defined as an imbalance between the actual folding capacity of the ER and the demand placed on this organelle. The unfolded protein response (UPR), an adaptive response that counteracts ER stress, has three components as follows: gene expression, translational attenuation, and ER-associated protein degradation system (8Harding H.P.

Accumulating evidence suggests that a high level of ER stress or defective ER stress signaling (i.e. the UPR) causes β-cell death during the development of diabetes (9Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D.

Inositol requiring 1 (IRE1), a sensor for unfolded and misfolded proteins in the ER, is a central regulator of the UPR. IRE1α, which is expressed ubiquitously, has a high level of expression in the pancreas and placenta (14Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 15Iwawaki T. Akai R. Kohno K. Miura M. Nat.

The presence of unfolded proteins in the ER causes dimerization, trans-autophosphorylation, and consequent activation of IRE1. Activated IRE1 splices XBP-1 (X-box binding protein-1) mRNA, leading to synthesis of the active transcription factor XBP-1 and up-regulation of UPR genes (18Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H.

Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In contrast, prolonged ER stress activates the cell-death pathway through IRE1. Under chronic ER stress, IRE1 recruits tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (20Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar), which activates apoptosis-signaling kinase 1 (ASK1) (21Hoeflich K.P. Yeh W.C. Yao Z. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R.

Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Activated ASK1 leads to the activation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase and, in the presence of extreme ER stress, induces apoptosis (23Nishitoh H. Matsuzawa A. Tobiume K. Saegusa K. Takeda K. Inoue K. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Ichijo H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this pathway is important for insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes (24Ozcan U. Cao Q. Yilmaz E. Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Ozdelen E. Tuncman G. Gorgun C. Glimcher L.H. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2004; 306: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). Obesity causes ER stress in the liver and leads to hyperactivation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase signaling. This causes serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and inhibits insulin action in liver cells. In addition, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 recruitment by IRE1 causes clustering and activation of caspase-12 at the ER membrane (25Yoneda T. Imaizumi K. Oono K. Yui D. Gomi F. Katayama T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13935-13940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Activated caspase-12 induces apoptosis under pathological ER stress conditions (26Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar). Two more upstream components in the UPR, PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) (27Yoshida H.

Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar), are also sensors of unfolded or misfolded proteins and are activated by the accumulation of such proteins in the ER. PERK is highly expressed in pancreatic islets (29Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar, 30Shi Y. Vattem K.M. Sood R. An J. Liang J. Stramm L. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7499-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activated PERK phosphorylates the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), which leads to the attenuation of general protein translation. This reduces the ER workload and protects cells from apoptosis resulting from ER stress (31Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). In Wolcott-Rallison syndrome, a rare form of juvenile diabetes, mutations in the EIF2AK3 gene encoding PERK have been reported (32Delepine M. Nicolino M. Barrett T. Golamaully M. Lathrop G.M. Julier C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). PERK knock-out mice also develop diabetes because of the high level of ER stress in the pancreas (33Harding H.P. Zeng H. Zhang Y. Jungries R. Chung P. Plesken H. Sabatini D.D. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 34Zhang P. McGrath B. Li S.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3864-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that β-cell death in patients with Wolcott-Rallison syndrome is caused by ER stress. ATF6 is a bZIP-containing transcription factor in the ER. Under ER stress, ATF6 is cleaved and released from the ER. The bZIP domain of ATF6 then translocates into the nucleus and up-regulates the UPR-specific downstream genes. The physiological role of ATF6 in pancreatic β-cells is not yet known. Increasing evidence suggests that a high level of ER stress and defective ER stress signaling are important in the pathogenesis of diabetes. It is highly likely that downstream components of ER stress signaling maintain ER homeostasis in pancreatic β-cells. Therefore, defective ER stress signaling could cause a high level of ER stress in pancreatic β-cells and lead to β-cell dysfunction and diabetes. Pancreatic β-cells are specialized in proinsulin folding and insulin secretion. It is possible that β-cells have a unique downstream component of ER stress signaling. In this study we investigated whether Wolfram syndrome gene 1 (WFS1) is a component of ER stress signaling and has a function in maintaining ER homeostasis in β-cells. Plasmids, Cell Culture, and Transfection—INS-1 832/13 cells were a gift from Dr. Christopher Newgard (Duke University Medical Center). INS-1 832/13 cells were maintained in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with siRNA for WFS1 using the Cell Line Nucleofector™ T kit and the Nucleofector device (Amaxa Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD). siRNAs were designed and synthesized at Qiagen (Valencia, CA) as follows: for rat WFS1-1, AAGGCATGAAGGTCTACAATT; for rat WFS1-2, AAGGCCATCAGCTGCCTCAAT. COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and then transfected with WFS1 expression vectors using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). Full-length human WFS1 cDNA, as well as P724L and G695V mutant WFS1 cDNA, were tagged with a FLAG epitope and subcloned to a pcDNA3 plasmid under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The P724L and G695V mutations were introduced using the GeneTailor site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human fibroblasts of a patient with Wolfram syndrome and a control individual were obtained, respectively, from Coriell Institute (Camden, NJ) and from Dr. Alan Permutt (Washington University School of Medicine). Human fibroblasts were maintained in Eagle's modified essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Immunostaining—COS7 cells and frozen sections of mouse pancreata were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min. The fixed cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, and incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 0.1% and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Images were obtained with a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope with LCS software. FLAG M2 antibody was purchased from Sigma. Anti-WFS1 antibody was generated as described previously (35Takeda K. Inoue H. Tanizawa Y. Matsuzaki Y. Oba J. Watanabe Y. Shinoda K. Oka Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Fibroblasts and INS-1 832/13 cells were lysed with M-PER (Pierce) containing protease inhibitors. COS7 cells were lysed for 15 min in ice-cold buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors. Insoluble material was recovered by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min and solubilized in 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature. After the addition of 4 volumes of lysis buffer, samples were sonicated for 10 s. Lysates were separated and normalized for total protein (20 μg per lane) using 4-20% linear gradient SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad) and then electroblotted. FLAG M2 antibody was purchased from Sigma. Anti-WFS1 antibody was generated as described previously (35Takeda K. Inoue H. Tanizawa Y. Matsuzaki Y. Oba J. Watanabe Y. Shinoda K. Oka Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Isolating Islets from Mouse Pancreas—Mice were anesthetized, and their pancreatic islets were then isolated by pancreatic duct injection of 5 ml (0.85 mg/ml) of collagenase solution followed by digestion at 37 °C for 25 min with mild shaking. Digestion was stopped by adding ice-cold RPMI with 1% horse serum. Islets were washed several times with RPMI, separated from acinar cells on a Histopaque gradient, and hand-picked using a dissecting microscope. Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the cells by RNeasy (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 1 μg of total RNA from cells was reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) primer. For the thermal cycle reaction, the ABI prism 7000 sequencer detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used at 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, then 40 cycles at 95 °C of 15 s each, and at 60 °C for 1 min. By using mouse actin for mouse embryonic fibroblasts, human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase for human fibroblasts, mouse actin for mouse islets, and rat actin for INS-1 832/13 cells as a control, the PCR was performed in triplicate for each sample and then repeated twice for all experiments. Cyber Green (Bio-Rad) and the following sets of primers were used for real time PCR: for mouse actin, GCAAGTGCTTCTAGGCGGAC and AAGAAAGGGTGTAAAACGCAGC; for mouse WFS1, CCATCAACATGCTCCCGTTC and GGGTAGGCCTCGCCATACA; for rat actin, GCAAATGCTTCTAGGCGGAC and AAGAAAGGGTGTAAAACGCAGC; and for rat WFS1, CATCACCAAGGACATCGTCCT and AGCACGTCCTTGAACTCGCT. WFS1 Is a Component of the IRE1 Signaling Pathway—The pathogenesis of Wolfram syndrome has been attributed to mutations in the WFS1 gene (35Takeda K. Inoue H. Tanizawa Y. Matsuzaki Y. Oba J.

Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 37Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Measuring the expression levels of WFS1 by real time PCR, we found that WFS1 mRNA is induced by ER stress and is under the control of IRE1α and PERK. In wild-type mouse fibroblasts, induction of WFS1 mRNA was increased 3-5-fold by two ER stress inducers, tunicamycin and thapsigargin (Fig. 1A). In Ire1α-/- and Perk-/- cells, WFS1 induction was attenuated (Fig. 1A). By measuring WFS1 protein expression levels by immunoblot using anti-WFS1 antibody, we found that WFS1 protein expression was decreased in Ire1α-/- and Perk-/- cells as compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 1B). Although there was a marked induction of WFS1 mRNA in wild-type cells by both inducers of ER stress (Fig. 1A), induction of WFS1 at the protein level in tunicamycin-treated cells in which N-glycosylation was inhibited was modest (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the WFS1 protein is unstable when N-glycosylation is inhibited. Also, there was no significant difference in WFS1 mRNA content between wild-type cells and both knock-out cells, although at the protein level, both Ire1α-/- and Perk-/- cells exhibited a profound decrease in WFS1 protein expression. This suggests further that WFS1 protein becomes unstable by chronic high levels of ER stress because there exists a higher base-line ER stress level in Ire1α-/- and Perk-/- cells, which are deficient in ER stress signaling. These results indicate that WFS1 is a component of the UPR and that its mRNA expression is regulated by the IRE1 and PERK signaling pathways. Mutant WFS1 Does Not Accumulate on the ER Membrane—It has been reported that WFS1 gene mutations lead to loss of function of WFS1 protein. Nonsense or frameshift mutations of the WFS1 gene lead to a complete absence of WFS1 protein because of instability of the mutant protein (36Hofmann S. Philbrook C. Gerbitz K.D. Bauer M.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2003-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To extend this observation, we examined the cellular localization of mutant WFS1 protein. Most of the WFS1 gene mutations in patients with Wolfram syndrome occur in exon 8, which encodes the transmembrane of the protein and in C-terminal luminal domains (5Inoue H. Tanizawa Y. Wasson J. Behn P. Kalidas K. Bernal-Mizrachi E. Mueckler M. Marshall H. Donis-Keller H. Crock P. Rogers D. Mikuni M. Kumashiro H. Higashi K. Sobue G. Oka Y. Permutt M.A. Nat.

Genet. 1998; 7: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We cloned the full-length human WFS1 gene by using human EST clones and then introduced into it the P724L and G695V mutations, which occur in Wolfram syndrome, by means of PCR-based mutagenesis. Like most WFS1 mutations in Wolfram syndrome patients, the P724L and G695V mutations occurred in exon 8. We then determined the cellular localization of wild-type and mutant WFS1 by immunostaining cells transfected with an expression vector for wild-type, P724L, or G695V WFS1 tagged at its C terminus with a FLAG epitope. Immunostaining of cells expressing wild-type WFS1 showed a diffuse reticular pattern that co-localized with the ER marker ribophorin I (Fig. 2, A-C). However, immunostaining with anti-FLAG antibody of cells expressing mutant WFS1 showed a punctate staining pattern in the ER, suggesting that WFS1 tends to aggregate there (Fig. 2, D-F). Part of WFS1P724L showed a diffuse reticular pattern and was co-localized with ribophorin I, suggesting that this part of WFS1P724L is localized to the ER membrane (Fig. 2, D-F). These staining patterns suggest that, in contrast to wild-type WFS1P724L, most of the newly synthesized WFS1 protein aggregates and thus is not expressed on the ER membrane. We obtained similar results by expressing WFS1G695V (data not shown). When we assessed the aggregation of WFS1P724L by SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis of detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble lysates from COS7 cells transiently expressing these proteins, we found that the formation of insoluble and high molecular weight complexes was much more prominent in cells expressing WFS1P724L than in cells expressing wild-type WFS1 (Fig. 2G, lower panel). We also measured WFS1 protein expression levels in fibroblasts from a patient with Wolfram syndrome and a control individual. We found that WFS1 protein could not be detected in the patient sample (Fig. 2H), suggesting that mutant WFS1 protein in patients with Wolfram syndrome does not accumulate in cells or can no longer be detected by the antibody because of a conformational change. Our results indicate that most of the newly synthesized mutant WFS1 protein tends to aggregate and does not fold into a proper three-dimensional structure. Therefore, it is likely that Wolfram syndrome is caused by a loss of function of WFS1. WFS1 Is Important in Sustaining ER Homeostasis in Pancreatic β-Cells—In immunohistochemistry experiments on mouse pancreata using anti-WFS1, anti-insulin, and anti-glucagon antibodies, we detected WFS1 mainly in the islets, where it co-localized with insulin (Fig. 3A). However, WFS1 did not co-localize with glucagon, indicating that WFS1 is especially important in the function of β-cells. It has been shown that WFS1 has an important function in stimulus-secretion coupling in insulin secretion (38Ishihara H. Takeda S. Tamura A. Takahashi R. Yamaguchi S. Takei D. Yamada T. Inoue H. Soga H. Katagiri H. Tanizawa Y. Oka Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1159-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To determine WFS1 gene expression levels during insulin secretion, we pretreated mouse islets for 1 h with 2.5 mm glucose and then stimulated these cells for insulin secretion with 16.7 mm glucose and 30 mm KCl. WFS1 gene expression increased after treatment with both 16.7 mm glucose and 30 mm KCl but not after treatment with 2.5 mm glucose (Fig. 3B), suggesting that WFS1 up-regulation is important for insulin secretion. By measuring WFS1 protein expression levels by immunoblot using anti-WFS1 antibody, we confirmed this WFS1 induction by 16.7 mm glucose in mouse islets (Fig. 3C). ER homeostasis is important for insulin secretion because proinsulin, the insulin precursor, must be folded into its proper three-dimensional structure in the ER in order to become mature insulin. As a direct means of examining the relationship between the loss of function of WFS1 and ER homeostasis, we knocked down WFS1 expression in a β-cell line, INS-1 832/13, using siRNA for WFS1. The suppression of WFS1 caused an increase in the expression of BiP (Fig. 4A), Ero1α (Fig. 4B), spliced XBP-1 (Fig. 4C), and total XBP-1 (Fig. 4D), markers for ER stress in INS-1 832/13 cells. This suppression also increased the expression of another ER stress marker, Chop (Fig. 4E). However, the induction of Chop mRNA was modest as compared with its usual up-regulation under ER stress. Because Chop is a downstream component of Perk signaling (39Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar), this suggests that eIF2α phosphorylation by Perk in response to WFS1 suppression is modest. Indeed, we could not detect eIF2α phosphorylation by suppressing WFS1 expression in INS-1 832/13 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that WFS1 has an important function in mitigating high levels of ER stress and in maintaining ER homeostasis in pancreatic β-cells. Therefore, suppression of WFS1 in β-cells could cause chronic ER stress in these cells. To analyze the WFS1 expression level under pathological conditions, we measured WFS1 mRNA induction in islets from the ob/ob diabetes mouse model. We isolated islets from diabetic ob/ob mice and control C57Bl6 mice and measured WFS1 mRNA induction by treating the cells with 16.7 mm glucose. We found that induction of WFS1 mRNA was significantly more attenuated in ob/ob mice than in control mice (Fig. 5). This suggests that β-cells in ob/ob mice are in a state of chronic ER stress and that WFS1 induction is saturated. Our study has shown that WFS1 is a component of IRE1 and PERK signaling (i.e. the UPR) and is important in the maintenance of ER homeostasis, specifically in pancreatic β-cells (Fig. 6). WFS1 mutations in patients with Wolfram syndrome lead to loss of function of WFS1. In addition, by using siRNA, we have shown that the suppression of WFS1 leads to a high level of ER stress in pancreatic β-cells. These findings suggest that WFS1 protects β-cells against ER stress and, conversely, that chronic ER stress is caused by loss of function of WFS1. Previous studies have shown that WFS1 protein serves as a regulator of the ER ion channel, most likely acting as a calcium channel (7Osman A.A. Saito M. Makepeace C. Permutt M.A. Schlesinger P. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52755-52762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 36Hofmann S. Philbrook C. Gerbitz K.D. Bauer M.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2003-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the increase in production of cytosolic Ca2+ in response to glucose is lower in the islets of WFS1 knock-out mice than it is in control mice (38Ishihara H. Takeda S. Tamura A. Takahashi R. Yamaguchi S. Takei D. Yamada T. Inoue H. Soga H. Katagiri H. Tanizawa Y. Oka Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1159-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that loss of function of WFS1 causes abnormal calcium homeostasis in the ER and elicits ER stress, leading to the death of pancreatic β-cells. Our findings suggest that the pathogenesis of Wolfram syndrome can be attributed to a very high level of chronic ER stress because of the lack of functional WFS1 protein in pancreatic β-cells (Fig. 4, A-F). WFS1 protein is expressed mainly in β-cells of the islets, but not in α-cells or exocrine acinar cells. Although α-cells and acinar cells are also active in protein secretion, WFS1 expression levels in these cells are much lower than those in β-cells that are specialized in insulin biosynthesis and secretion. Therefore, our findings of WFS1 expression only in β-cells and of WFS1 up-regulation during insulin secretion suggest that WFS1 is an important component of proinsulin folding and processing in the ER of β-cells. Our results also show that pathogenic WFS1 mutants do not accumulate in the soluble fraction of cells and make insoluble aggregates. It is possible that the accumulation of pathogenic WFS1 mutants is toxic to pancreatic β-cells, causing them to malfunction in patients with Wolfram syndrome. Indeed, we found that transient expression of pathogenic WFS1 mutants caused ER stress in a pancreatic β-cell line, MIN6 (data not shown). However, stable expression of pathogenic WFS1 in MIN6 cells did not cause ER stress and did not change the viability of these cells. 4S. G. Fonseca, M. Fukuma, K. L. Lipson, L. X. Nguyen, J. R. Allen, Y. Oka, and F. Urano, unpublished observations. These observations suggest that the expression of mutant WFS1 causes ER stress in pancreatic β-cells under specific conditions. It is also possible that ER stress response caused by transient and incomplete suppression of WFS1 with siRNA might differ from that caused by chronic and complete WFS1 deficiency. We plan to undertake additional studies to explore these possibilities. The high levels of ER stress and pancreatic β-cell death in patients with Wolfram syndrome may be related to the β-cell dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes. The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is a result of peripheral resistance to the action of insulin, which may lead to a prolonged increase in insulin biosynthesis. Because the folding capacity of the ER is then overwhelmed, this peripheral resistance to insulin may activate the ER stress signaling pathways. For this reason, chronic ER stress in β-cells may lead to β-cell death in patients with type 2 diabetes who are genetically susceptible to ER stress. Further investigations of ER stress in the pathogenesis of diabetes are needed to obtain an understanding of the relationship between ER stress and type 2 as well as type 1B diabetes.

Classical hydrodynamic models predict that the solar interior must rotate highly differentially, in disagreement with observations. It has recently been shown that internal waves produced by convection in solar-type stars produce an asymmetric, shear layer oscillation, similar to Earth's quasi-biennial oscillation, that leads to efficient angular momentum redistribution from the core to the envelope. We present results of a model that successfully reproduces both the rotation profile and the surface abundance of lithium in solar-type stars of various ages."

The emission of spins from the source was observed, and a region of spin accumulation was imaged near the ferromagnetic drain contact. Both injected and accumulated spins have the same orientation (antiparallel to the contact magnetization), and we show that the accumulated spin polarization flows away from the drain (against the net electron current), indicating that electron spins are polarized by reflection from the ferromagnetic drain contact. The electrical conductance can be modulated by controlling the spin orientation of optically injected electrons flowing through the drain."

We suggest that the overall increase in oxygen, mediated by the formation of passive continental margins along the Atlantic Ocean during the opening phase of the current Wilson cycle, was a critical factor in the evolution, radiation, and subsequent increase in average size of placental mammals."

Severely impaired calcium signaling in acinar cells of the salivary glands and the pancreas in the double mutants ascribed the secretion deficits to a lack of intracellular calcium release.

Inactivating and activating mutations of the receptor in humans have been shown to respectively induce hyper- and hypoparathyrodism (1Hofer A.M. Brown E.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). CASR is widely expressed in many tissues (2Chattopadhyay N. Brown E.M. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), where it has been shown to play an important role in regulating parathyroid hormone secretion by the parathyroid gland, calcitonin secretion by C-cells in the thyroid, calcium and water transport by kidney epithelia, parathyroid hormone-related protein production and calcium transport in the mammary gland (3VanHouten J.

Although calcium is the physiological ligand for CASR, other divalent and trivalent cations can also activate this receptor. In addition, CASR activity (in the presence of Ca2+) is allosterically modulated by amino acids (5Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Extracellular calcium-sensing responses are also observed in tissues where the physiological role of CASR is not certain, such as bone. For example, cultured osteoblasts and osteoclasts from bone respond to increased extracellular calcium through a cell surface calcium-sensing mechanism that may be distinct from CASR (10Pi M.

In addition, CASR null mice exhibit no abnormalities of osteoblastic and osteoclastic function after correction of hyperparathyroidism that results from the deletion of CASR in parathyroid glands (18Tu Q. Pi M. Karsenty G. Simpson L. Liu S. Quarles L.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).

Chem. 2000; 275: 3256-3263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of another extracellular calcium-sensing mechanism. Because the bone microenvironment has a higher calcium concentration than the systemic circulation and different calcium binding proteins due to the presence of extracellular matrix proteins, a unique calcium-sensing receptor may be required in osteoblasts. A putative osteoblastic calcium-sensing receptor has been proposed to exist in osteoblasts (Ob. CASR) that is distinguished from CASR by differences in ligand specificity and coupling to signal transduction pathways (10Pi M. Quarles L.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recent functional characterization of Ob. CASR indicates its ability to sense cations and amino acids and function like a G-protein-coupled receptor, suggesting that this putative receptor may also belong to the family C of GPCRs, which are characterized by an evolutionarily conserved amino acid-sensing motif linked to an intramembranous 7-transmembrane loop region (10Pi M. Quarles L.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The C family of GPCRs consists of eight metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1-8), two γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABABR1/2), three taste receptors (T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3) and six orphan receptors (RAIG1, GPRC6A, GPRC5B-5D, and GABABL) in addition to CASR (20Pin J.P.

To determine whether GPRC6A is a candidate for an alternative cation-sensing receptor, we examined the response of GPRC6A to a panel of extracellular cations, assessed whether this receptor is expressed in bone and osteoblasts, and determined whether it is responsive to calcimimetics as well as osteocalcin, the most abundant calcium-binding extracellular matrix protein in bone. Materials—Aluminum chloride (AlCl3·6H2O) was obtained from Fisher. Calcium chloride, gadolinium chloride hexahydrate, magnesium chloride, and strontium chloride were purchased from Sigma. Bovine serum albumin (faction V) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Osteocalcin (purified from bovine bone) was purchased from Biodesign International (Saco, ME). Plasmids—GPRC6A cDNA was RT-PCR-amplified from human kidney total RNA and cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(+)-Puro, which is the same as pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) except that the neomycin resistance gene is replaced by the gene encoding puromycin resistance. RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and Moloney murine leukemia virus (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A portion of the RT reaction mix, GPRC6A-specific primers (forward, 5′-cgaaacatggcattcttaattatact; reverse, 5′-atcctggaatgtggcatctctcctaag) and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were combined in a PCR reaction mix, and the GPRC6A cDNA was amplified using conventional cycling conditions. The 2816-bp cDNA amplimer was purified using Promega Wizard PCR cleanup reagents, then ligated into pcDNA3.1(+)-Puro vector previously digested with BamHI/EcoRV and made blunt-ended by treatment with Klenow. The ligation mix was electroporated into Escherichia coli DH10B, and several ampicillin-resistant colonies were picked and expanded in LB (amp) medium. Plasmid DNAs were purified from individual clones using Qiagen Qiaprep reagents, then digested with BamHI and EcoRV and size-separated by electrophoresis through a 0.8% agarose gel to identify those clones containing the full-length cDNA in the correct orientation relative to the CMV promoter. The integrity of the GPRC6A open reading frame was confirmed by comprehensive DNA sequencing. The Myc-tagged mouse GPRC6A cDNA was kindly provided by Drs. Yao and Hampson (40Kuang D. Yao Y. Lam J.

The PCR primers for GPRC6A application are GPRC6A.F737 (5′-tgtgcattgccttcaaagag) and GPRC6A.R1812 (5′-gagagccaaggagtcatccc). Mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified as a control. Amplification products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. RNA was isolated from mouse kidney, testis, epididymis, bone, and fat by grinding snap-frozen tissues in liquid nitrogen and then extracting total RNA using Trizol reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). RNA samples pretreated with DNase were further cleaned using an RNeasy spin column (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia CA), and the yield was quantified using a Ribogreen RNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). RT-PCR was performed using a two-step RNA PCR procedure by modification of previously described methods (19Pi M. Garner S.C. Flannery P. Spurney R.F. Quarles L.D. J. Biol.

Briefly, in separate reactions 2.0 μg of DNase-treated total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA with the respective reverse primers specified below, and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Reactions were carried out at 42 °C for 60 min followed by 94 °C for 5 min and 5 °C for 5 min. The products of first strand cDNA synthesis were directly amplified by PCR using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using three separate sets of primers based on the human β-arrestins and G-protein-coupled receptor kinase cDNA sequence. PCR was performed with thermal cycling parameters of 94 °C for 3 min, 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The primers for GPRC6A application were GPRC6A.F737 (5′-tgtgcattgccttcaaagag) and GPRC6A.R1812 (5′-gagagccaaggagtcatccc). Human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified as a control. Amplification products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Cell Culture—All culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA. HEK-293 cells stably expressing rat CASR were created as previously described (45Spurney R.F.

HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. To evaluate cation responses, cells were induced to undergo growth arrest by overnight incubation in serum-free media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cations or amino acids were added at the concentrations stated. Transfection—HEK-293 cells were transiently co-transfected with SRE-luc and the following plasmids: β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, Gαq-(305-355), C3 toxin, RGS2, RGS4, or RGS12 (46Pi M. Spurney R.F. Tu Q. Hinson T. Quarles L.D. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3830-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All plasmid DNAs were prepared using the EndoFree™ Plasmid Maxi Kit (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were performed as follows. 1 × 105 HEK-293 were plated in the 6-well plate and incubated overnight at 37 °C. A DNA-liposome complex was prepared by mixing DNA of the SRE-luciferase reporter plasmid, pCMV-β-gal, and other expression vectors as indicated with TransFast™ transfection reagent (Promega). The total plasmid DNA was equalized in each well by adjusting the total amount of DNA to 2 μg per well with the empty vector. Quiescence of transfected cells was achieved in subconfluent cultures by removing the media and washing with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) to remove residual serum followed by incubation for an additional 24 h in serum-free quiescent media. Luciferase activity was assessed after 8 h of stimulation. The luciferase activity in cell extracts was measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol using a BG-luminometer (Gem Biomedical, Inc., Hamden, CT). To assess the impact of inhibition of Gαi, we used HEK-293 cells stably transfected with GPRC6A and SRE-luciferase plasmids plated in 6-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. Quiescence of transfected cells was achieved in subconfluent cultures by removing the media and washing with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) to remove residual serum followed by incubation for an additional 24 h in serum-free quiescent media. Then cells were pretreated with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (Sigma) for 5 h. Luciferase activity was assessed after 8 h, and ERK activity was assessed after 10 min of stimulation with 10 mm calcium. Confocal Microscopic Analysis—The 5 × 105 HEK-293 cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium on the coverslips in 60-mm plates and grown overnight at 37 °C. The cells were transfected with Myc-tagged mouse GPRC6A cDNA using TransFast™ transfection reagent (Promega). At 48 h post-transfection the cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The cells were then washed twice with PBS. The cells were subsequently incubated with the anti-Myc-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody (Invitrogen) at a 1:500 dilution in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The cells were washed twice for 5 min each with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, mounted onto microscope slides using the ProLong Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes), and examined under a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning microscope. Assay for ERK1/2 Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase—After 10 min of agonist treatment for the specified concentrations and duration, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped into 250 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.02 tablet/ml of protease inhibitor mixture). Equal amounts of lysates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and phospho-ERK1/2 levels were determined by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). To confirm that variations in the amount of ERK did not contribute to stimulated ERK activity, in selected studies we used an anti-ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) to measure ERK levels.

The platelet-derived phospholipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) decreases EC permeability in vitro and in vivo and thus has obvious therapeutic potential. We examined S1P-mediated human pulmonary artery EC signaling and barrier regulation in caveolin-enriched microdomains (CEM). Immunoblotting from S1P-treated EC revealed S1P-mediated rapid recruitment (1 microM, 5 min) to CEMs of the S1P receptors S1P1 and S1P3, p110 PI3 kinase alpha and beta catalytic subunits, the Rac1 GEF, Tiam1, and alpha-actinin isoforms 1 and 4. Immunoprecipitated p110 PI3 kinase catalytic subunits from S1P-treated EC exhibited PIP3 production in CEMs. Immunoprecipitation of S1P receptors from CEM fractions revealed complexes containing Tiam1 and S1P1. PI3 kinase inhibition (LY294002) attenuated S1P-induced Tiam1 association with S1P1, Tiam1/Rac1 activation, alpha-actinin-1/4 recruitment, and EC barrier enhancement. Silencing of either S1P1 or Tiam1 expression resulted in the loss of S1P-mediated Rac1 activation and alpha-actinin-1/4 recruitment to CEM. Finally, silencing S1P1, Tiam1, or both alpha-actinin isoforms 1/4 inhibits S1P-induced cortical F-actin rearrangement and S1P-mediated barrier enhancement. Taken together, these results suggest that S1P-induced recruitment of S1P1 to CEM fractions promotes PI3 kinase-mediated Tiam1/Rac1 activation required for alpha-actinin-1/4-regulated cortical actin rearrangement and EC barrier enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W2052965880,"The Rev1 DNA polymerase is highly specialized for the incorporation of C opposite template G. We present here the crystal structure of yeast Rev1 bound to template G and incoming 2′-deoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate (dCTP), which reveals that the polymerase itself dictates the identity of the incoming nucleotide, as well as the identity of the templating base. Template G and incoming dCTP do not pair with each other. Instead, the template G is evicted from the DNA helix, and it makes optimal hydrogen bonds with a segment of Rev1. Also, unlike other DNA polymerases, incoming dCTP pairs with an arginine rather than the templating base, which ensures the incorporation of dCTP over other incoming nucleotides. This mechanism provides an elegant means for promoting proficient and error-free synthesis through N 2 -adducted guanines that obstruct replication."

https://openalex.org/W2159177346,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced mitochondrial abnormalities may have important consequences in the pathogenesis of degenerative diseases and cancer. Vitamin C is an important antioxidant known to quench ROS, but its mitochondrial transport and functions are poorly understood. We found that the oxidized form of vitamin C, dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), enters mitochondria via facilitative glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) and accumulates mitochondrially as ascorbic acid (mtAA). The stereo-selective mitochondrial uptake of D-glucose, with its ability to inhibit mitochondrial DHA uptake, indicated the presence of mitochondrial Glut. Computational analysis of N-termini of human Glut isoforms indicated that Glut1 had the highest probability of mitochondrial localization, which was experimentally verified via mitochondrial expression of Glut1-EGFP. In vitro mitochondrial import of Glut1, immunoblot analysis of mitochondrial proteins, and cellular immunolocalization studies indicated that Glut1 localizes to mitochondria. Loading mitochondria with AA quenched mitochondrial ROS and inhibited oxidative mitochondrial DNA damage. mtAA inhibited oxidative stress resulting from rotenone-induced disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and prevented mitochondrial membrane depolarization in response to a protonophore, CCCP. Our results show that analogous to the cellular uptake, vitamin C enters mitochondria in its oxidized form via Glut1 and protects mitochondria from oxidative injury. Since mitochondria contribute significantly to intracellular ROS, protection of the mitochondrial genome and membrane may have pharmacological implications against a variety of ROS-mediated disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2133179249,"The role of Rac family proteins in platelet spreading on matrix proteins under static and flow conditions has been investigated by using Rac-deficient platelets. Murine platelets form filopodia and undergo limited spreading on fibrinogen independent of Rac1 and Rac2. In the presence of thrombin, marked lamellipodia formation is observed on fibrinogen, which is abrogated in the absence of Rac1. However, Rac1 is not required for thrombin-induced aggregation or elevation of F-actin levels. Formation of lamellipodia on collagen and laminin is also Rac1-dependent. Analysis of platelet adhesion dynamics on collagen under flow conditions in vitro revealed that Rac1 is required for platelet aggregate stability at arterial rates of shear, as evidenced by a dramatic increase in platelet embolization. Furthermore, studies employing intravital microscopy demonstrated that Rac1 plays a critical role in the development of stable thrombi at sites of vascular injury in vivo. Thus, our data demonstrated that Rac1 is essential for lamellipodia formation in platelets and indicated that Rac1 is required for aggregate integrity leading to thrombus formation under physiologically relevant levels of shear both in vitro and in vivo.

The Rho family of small GTPases, which includes Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 proteins, plays distinct roles in regulating actin assembly and motility. These proteins cycle between an inactive (GDP-bound) and an active (GTP-bound) conformation that can subsequently interact with specific effector proteins. There are three members of the Rac family in mammals, all of which share a common structural arrangement. Rac1 is ubiquitously expressed and is the most extensively studied isoform. Rac2 is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells, whereas Rac3 is expressed primarily in the brain during development. These three isoforms of Rac share between 89 and 93% identity in their amino acid sequence (1Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20384-20388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).Initial studies in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts demonstrated that Rac promotes polymerization of actin at the cell membrane, producing lamellipodia and membrane ruffles (2Ridley A.J.

Rac is believed to stimulate actin polymerization through the SCAR (suppressor of cyclic AMP receptor)/WAVE (WASP family verprolin-homologous protein) family of Rac-binding proteins. The SCAR/WAVE family activates the Arp2/3 complex, which nucleates new barbed ends by forming branches on actin filaments near protruding edges of the cell (8Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 9Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr.

The activation of the Rac-SCAR/WAVE-Arp2/3 pathway at the leading edge of a cell triggers actin polymerization and growth of lamellipodia (11Kraynov V.S. Chamberlain C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Slabaugh S. Hahn K.M. Science. 2000; 290: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Rac is also implicated in the regulation of a number of other pathways, including the oxidative burst in neutrophils, regulation of synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and gene expression essential for cellular proliferation and hypertrophy (12Gregg D. Rauscher F.M. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C723-C734Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Quiescent platelets circulate in the bloodstream as biconcave discs. The activation of platelets at sites of vascular injury plays a key role in hemostasis. Upon activation on an immobilized matrix, they round up, extend filopodia, and form lamellipodia. This change in morphology serves to increase the platelet surface area and thereby strengthens the contact with the immobilized surface as well as with other platelets. This change in morphology is mediated by the rapid reorganization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton through a combination of uncapping, severing, and nucleation. Previous work has indicated that gelsolin-mediated uncapping and severing of existing F-actin filaments play a critical early role in stimulating polymerization of actin monomers to form new filaments (13Barkalow K. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Rac was originally proposed to promote exposure of actin ends through the synthesis of polyphosphoinositides (5Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), although it now seems more likely that it primarily mediates this event via the Arp2/3 complex. The gelsolin and Rac pathways have been proposed to act in tandem, with gelsolin promoting actin filament uncapping and severing, and Rac activating the Arp2/3 complex, thereby leading to rapid actin polymerization of new filaments at the leading edge of lamellipodia (14Falet H. Hoffmeister K.M. Neujahr R. Italiano Jr., J.E. Stossel T.P. Southwick F.S. Hartwig J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16782-16787Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).

Rac is also activated downstream of the tyrosine kinase-linked collagen receptor, GPVI, which signals through sequential activation of Src and Syk tyrosine kinases, through a pathway that this is dependent on release of the G protein-coupled secondary mediators, ADP and thromboxane A2 (18Pearce A.C.

The results demonstrate a central role for Rac1 in supporting formation of lamellipodia but not filopodia in thrombin- or ADP-stimulated platelets on a fibrinogen surface. Furthermore, Rac1 is shown to be essential for GPVI-regulated platelet spreading as well as sustaining shear-resistant platelet aggregates under dynamic flow conditions both in vitro and in vivo. Together this study demonstrates a cooperative role of integrin and G protein-coupled receptors in regulating Rac activation and lamellipodia formation in platelets that enables them to withstand the high shear forces to which they are exposed in the vasculature.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—The αIIbβ3 antagonist lotrafiban was supplied by Glaxo-SmithKline (King of Prussia, PA). The anti-Rac (23A8) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (TCS Biologicals, Bucks, UK). Anti-Rac2 polyclonal antibody and anti-Rac3 polyclonal antibody were generously provided from Gary Bokoch (Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA) and Ivan de Curtis (San Rafaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy), respectively. The cDNA for the GST-CRIB domain of PAK1 prepared as described previously (21Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Fibrinogen depleted of plasminogen, VWF, and fibronectin was from Kordia Laboratory Supplies, Leiden, Netherlands. VWF was a generous gift from Michael C. Berndt (Monash University, Clayton, Australia). All other reagents were from Sigma or previously named sources (22Wonerow P. Pearce A.C. Vaux D.J. Watson S.P. J. Biol.

Zhao Y. Andrew N. Machesky L.M. Staunton D. Frampton J. Watson S.P. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 2: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared by centrifugation of whole blood at 200 × g for 20 min. The platelets were then isolated from PRP by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min in the presence of prostacyclin (0.1 μg/ml). The pellet was resuspended in modified HEPES/Tyrodes buffer (in mm: 129 NaCl, 0.34 Na2HPO4, 2.9 KCl, 12 NaHCO3, 20 HEPES, 5 glucose, 1 MgCl2; pH 7.3) containing 0.1 μg/ml prostacyclin. The platelets were washed once via centrifugation (1000 × g for 10 min) and resuspended at the desired concentration with HEPES/Tyrode buffer.Preparation of Murine Washed Platelets—The generation of mice bearing a conditional loxP-flanked allele of Rac1, Rac1flox, has been described previously (6Walmsley M.J. Ooi S.K. Reynolds L.F. Smith S.H. Ruf S. Mathiot A. Vanes L. Williams D.A. Cancro M.P. Tybulewicz V.L. Science. 2003; 302: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To induce expression of the Mx1-Cre transgene, the mice were given a 150-μl intraperitoneal injection of synthetic double-stranded RNA polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (2 mg/ml) every other day for a total of three injections, and blood was taken at least 14 days after the last injection to ensure a complete turnover of platelets. The protein expression of Rac1 and Rac2 was verified for both control and Rac-deficient mice for each experiment (data not shown). The number of platelets in whole blood from Rac1-/-, Rac2-/-, or Rac1-/--Rac2-/- mice was no different from wild type (data not shown). Bleeding problems, such as the intraperitoneal hemorrhage seen in Syk- and SLP-76-deficient mice, were not observed for these mice.Murine blood was drawn from CO2 terminally anesthetized mice by cardiac puncture and taken into 100 μl of acid/citrate/dextrose. PRP was obtained by centrifugation at 200 × g for 6 min. Washed platelets were prepared via centrifugation of PRP at 1000 × g in the presence of prostacyclin (0.1 μg/ml) for 6 min. The pellet was resuspended in modified HEPES/Tyrode buffer to the desired platelet level. All animals were maintained using housing and husbandry in accordance with local and national legal regulations.In separate experiments, human or murine platelet suspensions were treated with 10 μm cytochalasin D, 0.1-10 μg/ml CRP, 1-10 μm ADP, 0.04-1 units/ml thrombin, 10 μm lotrafiban or 1 mm adenosine 3′,5′-diphosphate (A3P5P), and 1 μm AR-C67085 for 10-30 min before use in the assays. Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were performed in the presence of 2 units/ml apyrase and 10 μm indomethacin and in the absence of exogenously added Ca2+.Measurement of Rac Activity—Rac activity was measured essentially as described in Pearce et al. (18Pearce A.C. Wilde J.I. Doody G.M. Best D. Inoue O. Vigorito E. Tybulewicz V.L. Turner M. Watson S.P. Blood. 2002; 100: 3561-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using the CRIB domain of PAK1 (amino acids 67-150), which binds the GTP-bound form of Rac. Following stimulation of platelet suspensions (3 × 108/ml), reactions were stopped with an equal volume of 2× lysis buffer (2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2% (w/v) N-octyl glucoside, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 7.4, and 2 mm orthovana-date). Alternatively, platelets (3 × 108/ml) were incubated for 10-45 min in dishes coated with fibrinogen, collagen, laminin, or BSA 2The abbreviations used are:BSAbovine serum albuminDiOC63,3′-dihexyloxacarbo-cyanine iodideVWFvon Willebrand factorPRPplatelet-rich plasmaPipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateDICdifferential interference contrastSAGEserial analysis of gene expression in the absence or presence of thrombin (1 units/ml) and apyrase (2 units/ml). Unbound platelets were removed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline followed by aspiration, and adherent cells were solubilized with 1× lysis buffer. A sample of the suspension over BSA was taken and used as a control. Insoluble material was then removed by centrifugation (5 min, 13,000 rpm), and GST-PAK1, previously incubated with glutathione agarose beads, stored in glycerol at -80 °C, and washed with 1× lysis buffer, was added to the lysates and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed with 1× lysis buffer, and the bound protein was taken up into Laemmli buffer. The resulting samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with a Rac-specific antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Protein was detected using ECL (Amersham Biosciences).Measurement of Filamentous Actin Content—Filamentous actin content of washed platelets was measured using a modification of the method of Machesky and Hall (24Machesky L.M. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Basal or activated platelets (2 × 108/ml) were fixed with an equal volume of 3.7% formaldehyde containing a saturating amount of FITC-phalloidin (20 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm Pipes, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3.7% formaldehyde, 2 μm FITC-phalloidin) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature on a nutator. The platelets were then pelleted for 2 min in a microcentrifuge, and pellets were washed in 0.1% saponin, 20 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm Pipes, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2. Pellets were then resuspended in methanol to extract the FITC-phalloidin and incubated for 1 h on a nutator at room temperature. FITC-phalloidin binding was measured for each sample with the fluorescence emission at 520 nm and excitation at 488 nm. Alternatively, F-actin levels were assessed via flow cytometry after fixation, permeabilization, and staining of platelets with FITC-phalloidin as described previously (18Pearce A.C. Wilde J.I. Doody G.M. Best D. Inoue O. Vigorito E. Tybulewicz V.L. Turner M. Watson S.P. Blood. 2002; 100: 3561-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Filamentous actin content was expressed as a comparison with values obtained for untreated cells processed in parallel on the same day.Platelet Aggregation and Shape Change—A quantity of 300 μl of PRP or washed platelets (2 × 108/ml) was used for aggregation. Stimulation of platelets was performed in a PAP-4 aggregometer (Bio/Data Corp., Horsham, PA) with continuous stirring at 1200 rpm at 37 °C for the times shown. Aggregation of platelets was monitored by measuring changes in light transmission.Static Adhesion Assays—Coverslips were incubated with a suspension of fibrinogen (100 μg/ml), collagen (100 μg/ml), or laminin (50 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Surfaces were then blocked with denatured BSA (5 mg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature followed by subsequent washing with phosphate-buffered saline before use in spreading assays. Quiescent platelets failed to bind to surfaces coated with denatured BSA (data not shown).Platelet spreading (2 × 107/ml) was imaged in real time using Köhler illuminated Nomarski differential interference contrast optics with a Zeiss 63× oil immersion 1.40 NA plan-apochromat lens on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope. Time-lapse events were captured by a Hamamatsu Orca 285 cooled digital camera (Cairn Research, Kent, UK) using Slidebook 4.0 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Denver, CO). To compute the length and thickness of filopodia and surface area of spreading platelets, images were manually outlined and quantitated by determining the number of pixels within each outline using a Java plugin for the Image J software package as described previously (23McCarty O.J. Zhao Y. Andrew N. Machesky L.M. Staunton D. Frampton J. Watson S.P. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 2: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Imaging a graticule under the same conditions allowed the conversion of pixels size to microns.Flow Adhesion Studies—For flow adhesion studies using collagen, mouse blood was drawn into sodium heparin (10 IU/ml) and d-phenyl-alanyl-1-prolyl-1 arginine chloromethyl ketone (40 μm). Alternatively, mouse blood was drawn into sodium citrate (0.38% w/v) for immobilized VWF adhesion studies. Glass capillary tubes (Camlab, Cambridge, UK) were coated with 100 μg/ml type I collagen from equine tendon (Horm, Nycomed, Munich, Germany) or 100 μg/ml VWF, 100 units/ml thrombin for 1 h at room temperature. The capillaries were washed and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mg/ml BSA for 1 h at room temperature before being mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (DM IRB; Leica, Milton Keynes, UK). Anticoagulated whole blood was perfused through the chamber for 4 min at a wall shear rate of 1000 s-1, followed by washing for 3 min at the same shear rate with modified Tyrodes buffer before being fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and imaged using DIC microscopy. In selected experiments, fixed samples were incubated overnight with the fluorescent dye DiOC6 (2 μm; Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, Oregon) before being imaged using confocal microscopy (DM IRE2; Leica, Milton Keynes, UK). In separate experiments, whole blood was fluorescently labeled with DiOC6 (2 μm, 10 min at 37 °C), and the accumulation of DiOC6-labeled platelets was monitored in real time using fluorescence microscopy (CoolSnap ES, Photometrics, Huntington Beach, CA).Image analysis was performed off-line using ImageJ. Platelet adhesion results are expressed as the percentage of surface area covered by platelets.Laser-induced Vessel Wall Injury—All procedures were undertaken with approval from the United Kingdom Home Office in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986. Male mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg Vetalar; Amersham Biosciences and Upjohn Ltd., UK) and 2% xylazine (20 mg/kg; Millpledge Pharmaceuticals, UK). The cremaster, a transparent muscle surrounding the testicle, was exteriorized and continuously superfused with a bicarbonate-buffered saline (36 °C) aerated with 5% CO2, 95% N2. High speed intravital microscopy experiments were performed as described previously by Falati et al. (25Falati S. Gross P. Merrill-Skoloff G. Furie B.C. Furie B. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1175-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Arterioles with a diameter of 25-35 μm were selected for study, and endothelial injury was induced using a pulsed nitrogen dye laser (coumarin 440 nm) focused on the luminal surface. To label platelets fluorescently, 20 μl of Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated to goat anti-rat antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 5 μl of rat anti-mouse CD41 antibody (Pharmingen) were added to 70 μl of saline and infused via the carotid cannula. Multiple thrombi in each cremaster preparation were generated upstream to previous injuries in the same or similar sized arterioles. The background fluorescence intensity, predominantly because of freely circulating platelets, was determined and subtracted from the fluorescence intensity of the developing thrombus. The resulting value was multiplied by the sum of all pixels above background to give a value for integrated intensity at each time point. This integrated intensity value was directly proportional to the size of the developing thrombus and when plotted against time provided a graph that illustrated the dynamic kinetics of platelet accumulation.Analysis of Data—Experiments were carried out on at least three occasions, and images shown are representative data from one experiment. Where applicable, results are shown as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance of differences between the means was determined by analysis of variance. If the means were shown to be significantly different, multiple comparisons were performed by the Tukey test. Probability values of p < 0.01 were selected to be statistically significant.RESULTSIdentification of Rac Isoforms Present in Platelets—To study the role of Rac proteins in regulating the organization of the platelet actin cytoskeleton, we first examined which Rac proteins are expressed in murine and human platelets. Previous reports have shown that Rac1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas Rac2 is a hematopoietic cell-specific GTPase (26Didsbury J. Weber R.F. Bokoch G.M. Evans T. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16378-16382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rac3 is thought to play an important role in neural development and has been shown to have a specific localization in the developing mouse brain (27Bolis A. Corbetta S. Cioce A. de Curtis I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify which Rac isoforms are present in platelets, we first examined a serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) library that had been prepared from primary murine megakaryocytes, the platelet precursor cell. 3M. G. Tomlinson, J. Frampton, and S. P. Watson, unpublished observations. This revealed the presence of 57 Rac1, 4 Rac2, and 0 Rac3 sequence tags out of a total of 53,046, indicating that Rac1 was likely to be the predominant isoform and that Rac3 was very unlikely to be present, consistent with its restricted distribution.Specific antibodies were then used to verify which Rac isoforms are present at the protein level in murine and human platelets. By using specific antibodies against all three family members, which do not exhibit cross-reactivity with the other isoforms (data not shown), immunoblot analyses established that murine and human platelets express Rac1 but have no detectable Rac2 expression at the protein level (Fig. 1). Wild-type and Rac2-/- thymocyte lysates were run alongside as a positive control. Furthermore, there were no compensatory changes in the levels of Rac1 or Rac 2 in Rac2-/- and Rac1-/- platelets, respectively. A specific antibody to Rac3, raised against the 15 carboxyl-terminal residues (27Bolis A. Corbetta S. Cioce A. de Curtis I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), failed to detect expression of Rac3 in human or murine platelets (data not shown). These data confirm that Rac1 is the predominant isoform in human and murine platelets. They further indicate that neither Rac2 nor Rac3 is likely to be present in platelets, although the small number of SAGE tags for Rac2 raises the possibility that it may be expressed at a very low level, and for this reason later experiments were performed on mice deficient in Rac1, Rac2, and both of these Rac isoforms.Regulation of Rac Activity in Platelets—With a view to studying the role of Rac1, we measured the activation state of the small GTPase in stimulated human and murine platelets by precipitation with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encompassing the CRIB domain of PAK, which has the binding region for the GTP-bound but not GDP-bound state. Stimulation of human platelet suspensions with the G protein-coupled agonist thrombin caused a marked increase in GTP-bound Rac1, which was not significantly altered in the presence of the ADP scavenger apyrase, thereby demonstrating that thrombin stimulation can lead to an increase in Rac activation independent of ADP (Fig. 2A). Stimulation with ADP also caused a smaller increase in active Rac1 (1.33 ± 0.06-fold increase as assessed by densitometry; mean ± S.E.; n = 3), which was abrogated in the presence of apyrase (1.02 ± 0.03-fold). Similar trends were observed for murine platelets (Fig. 2B). Thrombin stimulated a robust increase in GTP-bound Rac1 in the absence and presence of apyrase, whereas the smaller, ADP-dependent increase (1.23 ± 0.09-fold) was eliminated in the presence of apyrase (0.99 ± 0.04-fold).FIGURE 2Effects of agonists on Rac1 activation in platelets both in suspension and on a fibrinogen surface. Equal numbers of washed human (A) or murine (B) platelets (5 × 108/ml) were stimulated with thrombin (thr; 1 unit/ml) or ADP (10 μm) in the absence or presence of ADP scavenger apyrase (2 units/ml) for 60 s before lysis. Subsequently platelet lysates were incubated with agarose beads coupled with GST-PBD fusion proteins to bind GTP-bound forms of Rac1. Total lysates or material binding to the GST-PBD beads were solubilized, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting with an anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody. In separate experiments, washed human (C) and murine (D) platelets (5 × 108/ml) were added to BSA- or fibrinogen (FG)-coated dishes in the absence or presence of thrombin (1 unit/ml) and incubated for 10 min. Dishes coated with fibrinogen were washed twice to remove nonadherent cells. Platelets adherent to fibrinogen or in suspension over BSA were lysed, and Rac activity was determined as described above.

The impact of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems is unclear, but it will likely depend on species adaptability and the rate of change of seawater pH relative to its natural variability. To constrain the natural variability in reef-water pH, we measured boron isotopic compositions in a approximately 300-year-old massive Porites coral from the southwestern Pacific. Large variations in pH are found over approximately 50-year cycles that covary with the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation of ocean-atmosphere anomalies, suggesting that natural pH cycles can modulate the impact of ocean acidification on coral reef ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2054727788,"Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms play a critical role in the Bayesian approach to phylogenetic inference. We present a theoretical analysis of the rate of convergence of many of the widely used Markov chains. For N characters generated from a uniform mixture of two trees, we prove that the Markov chains take an exponentially long (in N) number of iterations to converge to the posterior distribution. Nevertheless, the likelihood plots for sample runs of the Markov chains deceivingly suggest that the chains converge rapidly to a unique tree. Our results rely on novel mathematical understanding of the log-likelihood function on the space of phylogenetic trees. The practical implications of our work are that Bayesian MCMC methods can be misleading when the data are generated from a mixture of trees. Thus, in cases of data containing potentially conflicting phylogenetic signals, phylogenetic reconstruction should be performed separately on each signal."

https://openalex.org/W2057998788,"Specialized O<sub>2</sub>-sensing cells exhibit a particularly low threshold to regulation by O<sub>2</sub> supply and function to maintain arterial <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub> within physiological limits. For example, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction optimizes ventilation-perfusion matching in the lung, whereas carotid body excitation elicits corrective cardio-respiratory reflexes. It is generally accepted that relatively mild hypoxia inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in O<sub>2</sub>-sensing cells, thereby mediating, in part, cell activation. However, the mechanism by which this process couples to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling mechanisms remains elusive, and investigation of previous hypotheses has generated contrary data and failed to unite the field. We propose that a rise in the cellular AMP/ATP ratio activates AMP-activated protein kinase and thereby evokes Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in O<sub>2</sub>-sensing cells. Co-immunoprecipitation identified three possible AMP-activated protein kinase subunit isoform combinations in pulmonary arterial myocytes, with α1β2γ1 predominant. Furthermore, their tissue-specific distribution suggested that the AMP-activated protein kinase-α1 catalytic isoform may contribute, via amplification of the metabolic signal, to the pulmonary selectivity required for hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Immunocytochemistry showed AMP-activated protein kinase-α1 to be located throughout the cytoplasm of pulmonary arterial myocytes. In contrast, it was targeted to the plasma membrane in carotid body glomus cells. Consistent with these observations and the effects of hypoxia, stimulation of AMP-activated protein kinase by phenformin or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-riboside elicited discrete Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling mechanisms in each cell type, namely cyclic ADP-ribose-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via ryanodine receptors in pulmonary arterial myocytes and transmembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into carotid body glomus cells. Thus, metabolic sensing by AMP-activated protein kinase may mediate chemotransduction by hypoxia."

https://openalex.org/W2115430579,"Osteopontin (OPN), a glycosylated phosphoprotein that binds calcium, is present in bone extracellular matrix and has been reported to modulate both mineralization and bone resorption. Targeted disruption in mice of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) or Runx2 results in marked inhibition of OPN expression in osteoblasts. In this study, we addressed possible cross-talk between VDR and Runx2 in regulating OPN transcription. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) or Runx2 stimulated OPN transcription (mouse OPN promoter -777/+79) 2–3-fold. However, coexpression of Runx2 and VDR in COS-7 cells and treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 resulted in an 8-fold induction of OPN transcription, indicating for the first time functional cooperation between Runx2 and VDR in the regulation of OPN transcription. In ROS 17/2.8 and MC3T3-E1 cells that contain endogenous Runx2, AML-1/ETO, which acts as a repressor of Runx2, significantly inhibited 1,25(OH)2D3 induction of OPN transcription, OPN mRNA, and protein expression. Both a Runx2 site (-136/-130) and the vitamin D response element (-757/-743) in the OPN promoter are needed for cooperative activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that 1,25(OH)2D3 can enhance VDR and Runx2 recruitment on the OPN promoter, further indicating cooperation between these two factors in the regulation of OPN. In osteoblastic cells, Hes-1, a downstream factor of the Notch signaling pathway, was found to enhance basal and 1,25(OH)2D3-induced OPN transcription. This enhancement was inhibited by AML-1/ETO, an inhibitor of Runx2. Immunoprecipitation assays indicated that Hes-1 and Runx2 interact and that 1,25(OH)2D3 can enhance this interaction. Taken together, these findings define novel mechanisms involving the intersection of three pathways, Runx2, 1,25(OH)2D3, and Notch signaling, that play a major role in the regulation of OPN in osteoblastic cells and therefore in the process of bone remodeling. Osteopontin (OPN), a glycosylated phosphoprotein that binds calcium, is present in bone extracellular matrix and has been reported to modulate both mineralization and bone resorption.

Taken together, these findings define novel mechanisms involving the intersection of three pathways, Runx2, 1,25(OH)2D3, and Notch signaling, that play a major role in the regulation of OPN in osteoblastic cells and therefore in the process of bone remodeling.

Giachelli C.M. Rittling S.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 2McKee M.D. Nanci A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). OPN is produced by osteoblasts when they form bone matrix (1Denhardt D.T. Giachelli C.M. Rittling S.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 2McKee M.D. Nanci A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). OPN is an extracellular matrix protein that contains arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) integrin binding motifs and promotes attachment of bone cells to the bone surface through binding to OPN receptors such as the αvβ3 integrin and CD44 (1Denhardt D.T. Giachelli C.M. Rittling S.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 2McKee M.D. Nanci A. Connect.

Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). OPN has been suggested to be involved in the attachment of osteoclasts during bone resorption, to play a role in osteogenesis by attachment of osteoblasts when they form bone matrix, and to act to regulate crystal size during bone mineralization (2McKee M.D. Nanci A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, OPN has been suggested to be a mediator of bone remodeling in response to mechanical strain (4Terai K. Takano-Yamamoto T. Ohba Y. Hiura K. Sugimoto M. Sato M. Kawahata H. Inaguma N. Kitamura Y. Nomura S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). OPN null mice are resistant to mineral loss and bone resorption upon estrogen deprivation and have impaired activation of osteoclasts (3Chellaiah M.A. Kizer N. Biswas R. Alvarez U.

Also, vascularization and resorption of bone discs have been reported to be significantly impaired in the absence of OPN (8Asou Y. Rittling S.R. Yoshitake H. Tsuji K. Shinomiya K. Nifuji A. Denhardt D.T. Noda M. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1325-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although recent studies using OPN null mice have provided new insight into the role of OPN in vivo in bone metabolism, the factors that affect the regulation of OPN are not yet clearly defined. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), the active form of vitamin D, is a major calcitropic hormone involved in calcium homeostasis (9Christakos S. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 573-586Google Scholar). One of its functions in bone is to regulate the synthesis of the bone calcium-binding proteins osteocalcin (OC) and OPN (9Christakos S. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 573-586Google Scholar). 1,25(OH)2D3 modulates the expression of these genes through transcriptional regulation. The actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 are mediated through the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Liganded VDR heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor and interacts with a vitamin D response element (VDRE). The VDRE in the mouse OPN promoter (at -757/-743) is a perfect direct repeat of the motif GGTTCA spaced by three nucleotides (10Noda M. Vogel R.L. Craig A.M. Prahl J. DeLuca H.F. Denhardt D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9995-9999Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Transcription proceeds through the interaction of VDR with coactivators and coregulators, including SRC-1/NcoA1, SRC-2/GRIP-1 (GR-interacting protein)/NcoA2, SRC-3/ACTR, and the multisubunit DRIP (vitamin D receptor-interacting protein) complex (11Rachez C. Freedman L.P. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 246: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Although a VDRE has been identified in the mouse OPN promoter (10Noda M. Vogel R.L. Craig A.M. Prahl J. DeLuca H.F. Denhardt D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9995-9999Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) and VDR null mice show marked inhibition of OPN expression in osteoblasts (12Yoshizawa T. Handa Y. Uematsu Y. Takeda S. Sekine K.

Genet. 1997; 16: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), the exact mechanisms, including protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, involved in 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated OPN transcription are not well understood.Runx2/Cbfa1 is a member of the runt/Cbfa family of transcription factors that was first identified as an osteoblast-specific transcription factor and a regulator of osteoblast differentiation (13Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.H. Inada M. Sato M. Okamoto R. Kitamura Y. Yoshiki S. Kishimoto T.

Marked decreases in the expression of osteopontin and osteocalcin are observed in Runx2 -/- mice, indicating the regulation of these genes by Runx2 (13Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.H. Inada M. Sato M. Okamoto R. Kitamura Y. Yoshiki S. Kishimoto T.

Montecino M. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7491-7500Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition, Runx2 has been shown to play a key role in the 1,25(OH)2D3 regulation of rat OC (15Javed A. Gutierrez S. Montecino M. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Mol. Cell.

Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8847-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet known whether a similar cooperation occurs between VDR and Runx2 in the regulation of OPN.Hes-1 (Hairy and enhancer of split homologue-1), a downstream target of the Notch signaling pathway, is a helix-loop-helix transcription factor that has been reported to play a role in developmental processes, including myogenesis and neurogenesis (17Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The expression of the Hes-1 gene is widely detected in embryos as well as adults (17Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Hes-1 is also expressed in osteoblastic cells (18Matsue M. Kageyama R. Denhardt D.T. Noda M. Bone. 1997; 20: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Hes-1 is coexpressed with Runx2 in osteoblastic cells, and Runx2 and Hes-1 physically interact (19McLarren K.W. Theriault F.M.

In addition, studies in Drosophila indicate that runt and hairy contribute to common transcriptional regulatory events (21Jimenez G. Pinchin S.M. Ish-Horowicz D.

Our findings define, for the first time, novel mechanisms involving the intersection of Runx2, 1,25(OH)2D3 and Notch signaling that are involved in the regulation of the OPN gene.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci (111 TBq)/mmol), nylon membrane, and the enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (ECL) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and PSN antibiotic mixture were purchased from Invitrogen. α-Minimal essential medium was purchased from Sigma. VDR antiserum (C-20), mouse OPN antiserum (P-18), and histone deacetylase-1 antiserum (H-51) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Runx2 antiserum was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA). The antiserum reacting to Hes-1 (a gift from T. Sudo, Kamakura, Japan) was produced by immunizing rabbits with a fusion protein consisting of the C-terminal 19 amino acids (SPSSGSSLTSDSMWRPWRN) of mouse Hes-1 coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 was a generous gift from Dr. Milan Uskokovic (Hoffmann-LaRoche, Nutley, NJ).Cell Culture—COS-7 African green monkey kidney cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. ROS17/2.8 cells (a gift of S. Rodan and G. Rodan (Merck)) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% PSN. MC3T3-E1 cells (Riken Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% PSN. All cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were seeded at 70–80% confluence 24 h before experiments. Treatments with 1,25(OH)2D3 were performed in medium supplemented with 2% charcoal-stripped serum.Transient Transfection and Dual Luciferase Assay—The mouse osteopontin promoter (-777/+79) firefly luciferase reporter construct was kindly provided by D. Denhardt (Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ). pCMV-Runx2 was a gift of G. Karsenty (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX), and pCMV-AML-1/ETO expression vector was from S. W. Hiebert (Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN). pcDNA3-Hes1 expression vector was a gift from Dr. S. Stifani (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). Cells were seeded in a 24-well culture dish 24 h prior to transfection at 70% confluence. Cells in each well were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Empty vectors were used to keep the total DNA concentration the same. Efficiency of transfection, as assessed by green fluorescent protein cotransfection and subsequent visualization, was estimated at 60–70%. 1,25(OH)2D3 (10-8 m) or TSA (15 nm) was added to cells 24 h post-transfection for another 24 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested by incubating with 1× passive lysis buffer, supplied by the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). The luciferase activity assay was performed according to the protocol of the manufacturer and normalized to values for pRL-TK-Renilla luciferase. For all transcription studies, OPN promoter activity (firefly/Renilla luciferase) is represented as -fold induction by comparison with basal levels (basal levels refer to levels of OPN promoter activity in cells transfected with vector alone and treated with vehicle).Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutant mouse OPN promoter (-777/+79) luciferase reporter constructs were generated by site directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The oligonucleotides used to generate the Runx2 mutated site (shown in lowercase) were as follows: 5′-CCT TTT TTT TTT TTT AAg aAC AAA ACC AGA GGA GG-3′ (top strand) and 5′-CCT CCT CTG GTT TTG Ttc TTA AAA AAA AAA AAA GG-3′ (lower strand). The oligonucleotides used to generate the VDRE mutated site (shown in lowercase) were as follows: 5′-CAG AGC AAC AAG Gcc CAC GAG GTT CAC GTC-3′ (top strand) and 5′-GAC GTG AAC CTC GTG ggC CTT GTT GCT CTG-3′ (bottom strand).Northern Blot Analysis—ROS17/2.8 cells or MC3T3-E1 cells, plated at 70% confluence in 100-mm tissue culture dishes, were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent, with AML-1/ETO or Hes-1 expression vector or vector alone. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated for 24 h with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10-8 m) or vehicle control. The treated cells were then harvested by trypsinization, pelleted, and washed with PBS. Total RNA was isolated by RNA-bee RNA extraction solution (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) and precipitated by chloroform and isopropyl alcohol. 20 μg of total RNA from each sample was used for Northern blot analysis as previously described (24Barletta F. Freedman L.P. Christakos S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 301-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled cDNA was prepared using the Random Primers DNA labeling system (Invitrogen) according to the random primer method (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocol in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2005: 6.3.1-6.3.4Google Scholar). The mouse osteopontin cDNA was generated by HindIII digestion and was a gift from D. Denhardt (Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ). The β-actin cDNA was purchased from Clontech. The blots were hybridized with the 32P-labeled mouse OPN cDNA probes for 16 h at 42 °C, washed, air-dried and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. BIOMAX MR film at -80 °C for 1 day. The same blots were stripped and probed with 32P-labeled β-actin cDNA. Autoradiograms were analyzed by densitometric scanning using the Dual-Wavelength Flying Spot Scanner. The relative optical density obtained using the OPN probe was divided by the relative optical density obtained after probing with β-actin to normalize for sample variation.OPN Western Blot Analysis—MC3T3-E1 cells, plated at 70% confluence in 100-mm tissue culture dishes, were transfected with vector alone or pCMV-AML1/ETO and treated with vehicle or 1,25(OH)2D3 (10-8 m) for 24 h and harvested by trypsinization. For Western blot analysis, 50 μg of protein from total cell lysates was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis. Protein was transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse OPN polyclonal antibody (P-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:1000 dilution in PBS containing 5% nonfat milk. The membrane was washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h with the corresponding secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The enhanced chemiluminescent Western blotting detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to detect the antigen-antibody complex.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS to 95% confluence prior to the experiment and then treated in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 2% charcoal-stripped serum under the conditions and for the times indicated. Treated cells were used for the ChIP assay (26Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar, 27Yamamoto H.

Briefly, cells were first washed with PBS and subjected to a cross-link reaction with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. The cross-link reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS twice. The cells were collected by scraping and lysed sequentially in 5 mm Pipes, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and then in 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, for 20 min individually. The chromatin pellets were sonicated to an average DNA size of 500 bp DNA (assessed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis) using a Fisher model 100 sonic dismembranator at a power setting of 1. The sonicated extract was centrifuged for 10 min at maximum speed and then diluted into ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C overnight with the indicated antibody overnight. After a 1-h incubation with salmon sperm DNA and bovine serum albumin-pretreated Zysorbin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), the precipitates were collected by centrifugation. Precipitates were washed sequentially in buffer I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), buffer II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA) twice. The protein-DNA was then eluted by using 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3 for 15 min twice. Cross-links were reversed by incubating at 65 °C overnight in elution buffer with 0.2 m NaCl. DNA fragments were purified using Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification kits (Valencia, CA) and subjected to PCR using the primers designed to amplify fragments of murine osteopontin promoter VDRE motif (upper, 5′-ACC ACC TCT TCT GCT CTA TAT GGC-3′; lower, 5′-TGA CAC TTG AAC TAT GCA GCC GC-3′) and the primers designed to amplify the Runx2 motif (upper, 5′-TTC CGG GAT TCT AAA TGC AGT CTA-3′; lower, 5′-CTC CCA GAA TTT AAA TGC TGG TCC-3′). PCR analysis was carried out in the linear range of DNA amplification. PCR products were resolved in 5% TBE acrylamide gel and visualized using ethidium bromide staining. DNA acquired prior to precipitation was collected and used as the input. 10% of input was used for PCR evaluation.In re-ChIP experiments, complexes were eluted by incubation for 30 min at 37°C in 60 μl of elution buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. The eluted samples were diluted 50 times with ChIP dilution buffer and subjected again to the ChIP procedure with specific antibodies.Nuclear Extracts—Cells were washed with cold PBS twice, harvested by scraping, pelleted by centrifuging at 4,000 rpm for 4 min. The pellets were washed and lysed in hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, phosphatase inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml aprotinin), and 1% Triton X-100. Nuclei were pelleted at 4,000 rpm for 4 min, and cytoplasmic supernatants were separated. Nuclei were resuspended in hypertonic buffer containing 0.42 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, and the phosphatase and protease inhibitors indicated above. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, nuclear soluble proteins were collected by centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentration of the supernatant was measured by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar), and aliquots were stored at -80 °C.Immunoprecipitation—To examine the association of Runx2 and Hes-1 in the presence or absence of 1,25(OH)2D3 coimmunoprecipitation experiments were done. Nuclear extracts were prepared as indicated above from ROS17/2.8 cells or MC3T3-E1 cells, and protein concentration was detected by the Bradford method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). 500 μg of each preparation was used for immunoprecipitation with the addition of 4 μg of Hes-1 antiserum or 4 μg of Runx2 antiserum in the presence or absence of 1,25(OH)2D3 (10-8 m) for 24 h at 4 °C. Then 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow Beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to each sample, and, after further incubation by rotating at 4 °C for 1 h, the immunoprecipitated complex was collected by centrifuging at 3,000 rpm for 5 min. The complex was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and probed with Runx2 antibody or Hes-1 antibody. Immunoprecipitation experiments were also done as described above using COS-7 cells transfected with VDR and treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10-8 m for 24 h) and cotransfected with vector alone (pCMV) or 2 μg of pCMV-Runx2 to examine the association of Hes-1 with histone deacetylase-1 in the presence or absence of Runx2. For these studies, 500 μg of nuclear extract was used for immunoprecipitation with the addition of 4 μg of histone deacetylase-1 antiserum followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow Beads incubated and collected by centrifugation as described above. The complex was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and probed with Hes-1 antibody.Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E., and significance was determined by analysis with Student's t test for two-group comparison or analysis of variance for multiple group comparison.RESULTSRunx2 Cooperates with VDR in Regulating OPN—Targeted disruption in mice of VDR or Runx2 results in a marked inhibition of OPN expression in osteoblasts (12Yoshizawa T.

In order to address possible cross-talk between VDR and Runx2 in regulating OPN transcription, studies were done using COS-7 cells (that lack endogenous VDR and Runx2) transfected with the mouse OPN promoter (-777/+79; VDRE -757/-743) and hVDR and/or Runx2 expression vectors. In 1,25(OH)2D3-treated (10-8 m for 24 h) VDR-transfected COS-7 cells, OPN transcription was induced 3.0 ± 0.4-fold. OPN transcription was induced 2.4 ± 0.1-fold by cotransfection of Runx2 expression vector in the absence of 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 1). Coexpression of Runx2 and VDR and treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10-8 m 24 h) resulted in an 8.3 ± 0.8-fold induction of OPN transcription (Fig. 1), suggesting functional cooperation between Runx2 and VDR in the regulation of OPN.The chimeric protein AML-1/ETO can efficiently block Runx2-mediated transcriptional activation (29Meyers S.

Biopsies of rejecting or ischemic renal allografts, which show both tubular cell injury and proliferation, display down-regulation of TNFR1 and activation of ASK1 as well as up-regulation of TNFR2 on tubular cells, where it colocalizes with phosphorylated endothelial/epithelial tyrosine kinase (Etk). We have exploited receptor-selective muteins and evaluated phosphorylation of receptor-specific kinases to study TNF responses in situ. In organ culture, a TNFR1-specific mutein changes phosphorylation of ASK1 to threonine 845, indicative of kinase activation. A TNFR2-specific mutein down-regulates TNFR1 in glomerular EC, up-regulates TNFR2 and Etk in tubular cells, and induces phosphorylation of Etk. Wild-type TNF induces TNFR2 and Etk and activates both ASK1 and Etk but does not down-regulate TNFR1. Wild-type TNF and TNFR1-specific mutein trigger tubular cell apoptosis whereas wild-type TNF and TNFR2-specific mutein induce tubular cells to express proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Differential activation of ASK1 and Etk by regulated TNFRs in patient-derived materials provides an explanation for diverse and opposing responses to TNF at distinct sites, and an in situ bioassay of TNFR signaling."

Accordingly, the behavior underlying patterns of paternity should be flexible as signals of quality change. To evaluate the dynamics of paternity allocation, we analyzed paternity before and after manipulating plumage coloration, a known signal of quality, in male barn swallows Hirundo rustica . We found that, in successive breeding bouts, only males whose plumage color was experimentally enhanced received greater paternity from their social mates, demonstrating evidence for flexible and dynamic paternity allocation and the importance for males of maintaining signals of quality well after pair bond formation."
https://openalex.org/W1973959565,"Numerous reports have established that lipid peroxidation contributes to cell injury by altering the basic physical properties and structural organization of membrane components. Oxidative modification of polyunsaturated phospholipids has been shown, in particular, to alter the intermolecular packing, thermodynamic, and phase parameters of the membrane bilayer. In this study, the effects of oxidative stress on membrane phospholipid and sterol organization were measured using small angle x-ray diffraction approaches. Model membranes enriched in dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine were prepared at various concentrations of cholesterol and subjected to lipid peroxidation at physiologic conditions. At cholesterol-to-phospholipid mole ratios (C/P) as low as 0.4, lipid peroxidation induced the formation of discrete, membrane-restricted cholesterol domains having a unit cell periodicity or d-space value of 34 Å. The formation of cholesterol domains correlated directly with lipid hydroperoxide levels and was inhibited by treatment with vitamin E. In the absence of oxidative stress, similar cholesterol domains were observed only at C/P ratios of 1.0 or higher. In addition to changes in sterol organization, lipid peroxidation also caused reproducible changes in overall membrane structure, including a 10 Å reduction in the width of the surrounding, sterol-poor membrane bilayer.

Lipid peroxidation is a degenerative process that affects unsaturated membrane lipids under conditions of oxidative stress (1Girotti A.W. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1529-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This complex process is believed to contribute to human aging and disease by disrupting the structural conformation, the packing of lipid components and, ultimately, the function of biological membranes. The polyunsaturated fatty acids of membrane phospholipids are particularly susceptible to peroxidation and undergo significant modifications, including the rearrangement or loss of double bonds and, in some cases, the reductive degradation of lipid acyl side chains (2Leibowitz M.E. Johnson M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1971; 12: 662-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gardner H.W. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1975; 23: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 4Buege J.A.

Recent studies conducted in our laboratory have provided direct evidence for changes in the molecular organization of membrane lipid bilayers following exposure to oxidative stress. Using small angle x-ray diffraction approaches, we examined model membranes composed of dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC) 2The abbreviations used are:DLPCdilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine (1,2-dilinoleoyl-3-sn-phosphatidylcholine)POPCpalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (1-palmitoyl,2-oleoyl-3-sn-phosphatidylcholine)C/Pcholesterol-to-phospholipid , before and after exposure to oxidative stress (21Mason R.P. Walter M.F. Mason P.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moderate levels of lipid peroxidation produced significant and reproducible alterations in the basic structure of the membrane phospholipid bilayer, including a marked reduction in membrane d-space (i.e. bilayer width plus surface hydration) and a decrease in intrabilayer headgroup separation. In addition, lipid peroxidation promoted an increase in the molecular volume associated with the unsaturated region of the hydrocarbon core and induced the apparent interdigitation of the phospholipid acyl chain terminal methyl segments (21Mason R.P. Walter M.F. Mason P.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Similar changes in membrane bilayer structure have also been observed in membranes reconstituted from cardiac phospholipids (21Mason R.P. Walter M.F. Mason P.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and in DLPC-enriched model membranes exposed to autoxidative forms of lipid peroxidation (22Mason R.P. Jacob R.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 196: 69-78PubMed Google Scholar). dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine (1,2-dilinoleoyl-3-sn-phosphatidylcholine) palmitoylphosphatidylcholine (1-palmitoyl,2-oleoyl-3-sn-phosphatidylcholine) cholesterol-to-phospholipid In this report, we extended this line of investigation by measuring the effects of lipid peroxidation on cholesterol organization and distribution in model membrane bilayers. Perturbation of membrane cholesterol content and structural organization has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of human diseases, many of which are also linked to conditions of increased oxidative stress. Numerous studies have shown that cholesterol directly modulates the physical properties of lipid bilayers, altering membrane responses to degenerative processes, including lipid peroxidation (23McLean L.R. Hagaman K.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 12: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Leonard A. Dufourc E.J. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Mowri H. Nojima S. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); however, little is known about the consequences of such processes on the membrane properties of cholesterol itself. In this study, small angle x-ray diffraction approaches were used to directly characterize the distribution of cholesterol in DLPC-enriched membranes exposed to various levels of peroxidative stress. The results of these experiments demonstrated that lipid peroxidation of membranes containing low levels of cholesterol (cholesterol-to-phospholipid mole ratios ranging between 0.4 and 0.8) promotes the formation of immiscible, membrane-restricted cholesterol domains. The formation of cholesterol domains was highly dependent on the extent of lipid peroxidation and was significantly inhibited by the addition of vitamin E. These data provided direct evidence for membrane lipid reorganization following oxidative insult and further implicated lipid peroxidation as an important contributor to mechanisms of aging and disease. Materials—DLPC and 1-palmitoyl,2-oleoyl-3-sn-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and stored in chloroform (25 mg/ml) at -80 °C until use. Cholesterol was also purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and stored in chloroform (10 mg/ml) at -20 °C. CHOD-iodide color reagent (stock) was prepared according to a procedure modified from El-Saadani et al. (26El-Saadani M. Esterbauer H. El-Sayed M. Goher M. Nassar A.Y. Jurgens G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 627-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and consisted of 0.2 m K2HPO4, 0.12 m KI, 0.15 mm NaN3, 10 μm ammonium molybdate, and 0.1 g/liter benzalkonium chloride. Prior to experimental use, the CHOD reagent was activated by adding 24 μm EDTA, 20 μm butylated hydroxytoluene, and 0.2% Triton X-100. Vitamin E ((±)-α-tocopherol; Sigma) was prepared in ethanol just prior to experimental use and added together with component lipids during membrane sample preparation. Preparation of Membrane Multilayer Samples—Membrane samples consisting of DLPC ± cholesterol, with cholesterol-to-phospholipid (C/P) mole ratios ranging from 0 to 1.0, were prepared as follows. Component lipids (in chloroform) were transferred to 13 × 100 mm test tubes and shell-dried under a steady stream of nitrogen gas while vortex mixing. Residual solvent was removed by drying for a minimum of 3 h under vacuum. After desiccation, each membrane sample was resuspended in diffraction buffer (0.5 mm HEPES, 154 mm NaCl, pH 7.3) to yield a final phospholipid concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. Multilamellar vesicles were then formed by vortex mixing for 3 min at ambient temperature (27Bangham A.D. Standish M.M. Watkins J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 238-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3645) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles composed of POPC and cholesterol were also prepared using this protocol. Immediately after initial multilamellar vesicle preparation, aliquots of each membrane sample were taken for baseline (0 h) peroxidation and diffraction analyses, as described below. Lipid Peroxidation Analysis—All lipid membrane samples were subjected to time-dependent autoxidation by incubating at 37 °C in an uncovered, shaking water bath. Small aliquots of each sample were removed at 24-h intervals and combined with 1.0 ml of active CHOD-iodide color reagent. To ensure spectrophotometric readings within the optimum absorbance range, sample volumes taken for measurement of lipid peroxide formation were adjusted for length of peroxidation and ranged between 100 and 10 μl. Test samples were immediately covered with foil and incubated at room temperature for >4 h in the absence of light. Absorbances were then measured against a CHOD blank at 365 nm using a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer. The CHOD colorimetric assay is based on the oxidation of iodide (I-) by lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) and proceeds according to the following reaction. LOOH+2H++3I−→LOH+H2O+I3−REACTION 1 The quantity of triiodide anion (I3−) liberated in this reaction is directly proportional to the amount of lipid hydroperoxides present in the membrane sample. The molar absorptivity value (ϵ) of I3− is 2.46 × 104m-1 cm-1 at 365 nm (26El-Saadani M. Esterbauer H. El-Sayed M. Goher M. Nassar A.Y. Jurgens G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 627-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Samples for X-ray Diffraction Analysis—Membrane samples were oriented for x-ray diffraction analysis as described previously (28Herbette L.G. DeFoor P. Fleischer S. Pascolini D. Blaise J.K. Biophys. J. 1985; 20: 245-272Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots containing 250 μg of multilamellar vesicles (based on phospholipid) were transferred to custom-designed Lucite sedimentation cells, each containing an aluminum foil substrate upon which to collect a single membrane pellet. Samples were then loaded into a Sorvall AH-629 swinging bucket ultracentrifuge rotor (DuPont) and centrifuged at 35,000 × g, 5 °C. Samples that were taken prior to initiation of peroxidation (baseline samples) were centrifuged for 90 min; samples that had undergone peroxidation beyond 24 h required overnight (∼16-18 h) centrifugation. Following orientation, the supernatants were aspirated, and the aluminum foil substrates, supporting the membrane pellets, were removed from the sedimentation cells and mounted onto curved glass slides. The samples were then placed in hermetically sealed brass canisters in which temperature and relative humidity were controlled during x-ray diffraction experiments. Potassium tartrate (K2C4H4O6 · ½H2O) was used to establish a relative humidity level of 74% in these experiments, and samples were incubated at this relative humidity at least 1 h prior to experimental analysis. Small Angle X-ray Diffraction Analysis—The oriented membrane fraction samples were aligned at grazing incidence with respect to a collimated, monochromatic x-ray beam produced by a Rigaku Rotaflex RU-200 high brilliance microfocus generator (Rigaku-MSC, The Woodlands, TX). Analytical x-rays are generated by electron bombardment of a rotating copper anode and are filtered through a thin nickel foil to provide monochromatic CuKα radiation (Kα1 and Kα2 unresolved; λ = 1.54 Å). Collimation of the x-ray beam was achieved using a single Franks mirror. Diffraction data were collected on a one-dimensional, position-sensitive electronic detector (Hecus x-ray Systems, Graz, Austria) using a sample-to-detector distance of 150 mm. In addition to direct calibration, crystalline cholesterol monohydrate was used to verify the calibration of the detector. This technique allows for precise measurement of the unit cell periodicity, or d-space, of the membrane lipid bilayer, which is the distance from the center of one lipid bilayer to the next, including surface hydration. The d-space for any given membrane multibilayer is calculated from Bragg's Law. hλ=2dsinθ(Eq. 1) where h is the diffraction order, λ is the wavelength of the x-ray radiation (1.54 Å), d is the membrane lipid bilayer unit cell periodicity, and θ is the Bragg angle equal to one-half the angle between the incident beam and scattered beam. Effects of Cholesterol on Lipid Peroxidation—Model membranes composed of DLPC alone, DLPC + cholesterol (at a C/P mole ratio of 0.6), or POPC + cholesterol (at the same C/P mole ratio) were prepared and subjected to autoxidation by incubation at 37 °C for 72 h. Lipid peroxidation was monitored at 24-h intervals from baseline (0 peroxidation) using the spectrophotometric CHOD-iodide assay (Fig. 1). In the absence of cholesterol, DLPC peroxidation was observed to increase by ∼50% between each time point up to 48 h; the concentration of lipid hydroperoxides increased by 200% at 72 h. The addition of cholesterol to DLPC membranes resulted in lipid hydroperoxide levels at each time point that were consistently greater than those observed for DLPC alone, with a 45% increase over control at the 72-h time point. No significant changes in POPC lipid peroxide levels were observed between experimental time points. Peroxidation-induced Cholesterol Domain Formation—These peroxidation data would suggest, as has been shown for DLPC alone (21Mason R.P. Walter M.F. Mason P.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), that progressive autoxidation significantly alters membrane structure, and such changes would be particularly enhanced in the presence of cholesterol. This hypothesis was tested in this study using small angle x-ray diffraction approaches. Representative diffraction profiles generated from both DLPC-only (controls) and DLPC + cholesterol (0.6 C/P) membranes, at 0- and 72-h peroxidation time points, are shown in Fig. 2. Scattering data collected from the non-peroxidized control yielded four strong diffraction orders and a unit cell periodicity (d-space) of 48 Å (Fig. 2A). Following peroxidation, the fourth lipid diffraction order was lost, and the membrane d-space was reduced to 44 Å (Fig. 2B), consistent with a membrane disordering effect. The addition of cholesterol to DLPC bilayers at peroxidation baseline resulted in an increase in membrane periodicity to 51 Å (Fig. 2C). Following 72 h of peroxidation, membrane phospholipid periodicity decreased to 41 Å in the presence of cholesterol (Fig. 2D). The diffraction pattern generated from this sample also revealed the presence of prominent cholesterol monohydrate domains, as indicated by well defined Bragg peaks having a unit cell periodicity of 34 Å. These data demonstrate that lipid peroxidation induces significant changes in membrane structure, the most striking of which is the lateral phase separation of cholesterol into distinct membrane domains. This biphasic lipid separation effect was not observed in POPC membranes containing equimolar concentrations of cholesterol and exposed to the same level of oxidative stress (Fig. 2, E and F). Effects of Peroxidation and Cholesterol Content on Domain Formation—To establish the basic biophysical requirements for the formation of cholesterol domains as observed in these model systems, x-ray diffraction approaches were used to examine DLPC membrane vesicles containing cholesterol at C/P mole ratios ranging from 0 to 1.0 (Fig. 3). At peroxidation baseline, cholesterol domain formation was not observed at C/P mole ratios below 1.0 (Fig. 3A), suggesting that greater cholesterol content is required for phase separation to occur under normal conditions. Changes in bilayer packing and distribution of cholesterol are particularly well illustrated in Fig. 3A. As the C/P mole ratio increases, the third-order phospholipid diffraction peak, prominent in the absence of cholesterol (0 C/P), decreases until completely diminished at 0.8 C/P. This third-order intensity effect is consistent with an increased packing of cholesterol within the hydrocarbon core of the phospholipid bilayer (29Mason R.P. Moisey D.M. Shajenko L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 315-321PubMed Google Scholar, 30McIntosh T.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 513: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A small third-order diffraction peak reappeared at 1.0 C/P, slightly overlapping with a larger, second-order diffraction peak associated with lateral cholesterol domains (17 Å). The changes at 1.0 C/P reflect a cholesterol “saturation” effect in which cholesterol is forced into separate lamellar domains as cholesterol packing between membrane phospholipids is reduced (31Tulenko T.N. Chen M. Mason P.E. Mason R.P. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 947-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid peroxidation significantly altered the cholesterol packing effects observed in DLPC membranes at baseline. After 72 h of peroxidation, well defined diffraction peaks corresponding to cholesterol domains were apparent at C/P mole ratios as low as 0.4 (Fig. 3B). The blunt right-handed shoulder associated with the first-order phospholipid diffraction peak at 0.2 C/P indicates that moderate cholesterol domain formation may be induced even at this lower cholesterol level. Interestingly, maximal cholesterol peak intensities were obtained at 0.6 C/P. This set of experiments suggested that a C/P range of 0.4-0.8 was optimum for studying peroxidation-induced cholesterol domain formation in DLPC vesicles. Time-dependent Changes in Peroxidation-induced Cholesterol Domain Structure—To further characterize the effects of peroxidation on cholesterol domain formation, two samples composed of DLPC + cholesterol at 0.6 C/P were separately prepared and examined at 24-h intervals over a 72-h lipid peroxidation time course (Fig. 4). For both samples, well defined diffraction peaks associated with cholesterol domains were identified as early as 24 h, and further peroxidation promoted the formation of stronger, more intense cholesterol diffraction peaks. Relative cholesterol peak intensities were derived from the integration of the 17 Å, second-order cholesterol peaks for each sample and plotted versus the length of peroxidation (Fig. 5). It can be noted that the intensities of the 34 Å cholesterol peaks also increased as a function of increasing exposure to oxidative insult (Fig. 4); however, since the first-order cholesterol peaks often overlap with the first- or second-order phospholipid diffraction peaks, the 17 Å peaks were better suited for quantitative analysis. Integration was performed using a subroutine written for Origin 6.0 (Microcal Software, Inc.). These data indicated that cholesterol peak intensity increased in a time-dependent manner, with a curvilinear function that is strikingly similar to the time-dependent changes in lipid peroxide formation (Fig. 5, inset).FIGURE 5Effects of lipid peroxidation on relative cholesterol peak intensity. Peak intensity was based on the integration of the 17.0 Å Bragg peaks observed in the diffraction patterns obtained from Samples 1 and 2 (Fig. 4). Note that cholesterol peak intensity increased sharply at 72 h in parallel with increased lipid peroxide formation as illustrated in the inset (▪, Sample 1; ○, Sample 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Concomitant with these pronounced changes in cholesterol structural organization, lipid peroxidation also induced significant changes in the structural organization of the cholesterol-poor phospholipid bilayer. As shown in Fig. 6, the membrane d-space of both samples decreased sharply with increasing length of peroxidation (72 h). For purposes of comparison, the membrane periodicity values obtained from cholesterol-deprived DLPC membranes are also plotted in Fig. 6. Up to 48 h, cholesterol appeared to increase relative membrane structural order as indicated by the higher d-space values associated with Samples 1 and 2 versus DLPC controls; however, this relationship was reversed at 72 h, concomitant with pronounced increases in lipid peroxide and cholesterol domain formation (Fig. 5). Effects of Vitamin E on Cholesterol Domain Formation—The treatment of model membranes (DLPC + 0.6 C/P) with vitamin E (1:50 vitamin E to phospholipid mole ratio) attenuated the formation of cholesterol domains up to the 24-h peroxidation time point (Fig. 7). Over this same time course, vitamin E inhibited lipid peroxide formation by 43% (data not shown). In additional x-ray diffraction experiments, vitamin E was shown to have no inherent disruptive effects on the structural organization of cholesterol domains in DLPC membranes saturated with cholesterol (>1.0 C/P mole ratio). These data indicate that vitamin E, as a function of its antioxidant properties, can significantly delay peroxidation-induced alteration of membrane structure and cholesterol organization. Lipid peroxidation is a free radical-mediated reaction that predominately affects polyunsaturated fatty acids in biological membranes. This reaction is typically initiated by abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a methylene group at the site of unsaturation, resulting in the formation of an alkyl radical that rapidly combines with molecular oxygen to form lipid peroxyl radicals. Lipid peroxides are highly unstable and readily react with neighboring fatty acids, setting off a chain reaction that propagates through the membrane unless checked by free radical scavengers, such as antioxidants (4Buege J.A. Aust S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10916) Google Scholar, 32Porter N.A. Caldwell S.E. Mills K.A. Lipids. 1995; 30: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). The rate of lipid peroxidation in biological membranes has been shown to be dependent on the physical state of constituent lipids. McLean and Hagaman (23McLean L.R. Hagaman K.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 12: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) showed that the rate of lipid peroxidation of arachidonic acid in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes was more rapid below the phase transition temperature (Tm) of the host lipid. Parallel anisotropy studies confirmed that the peroxidation rate was directly related to the motional order of the lipid bilayer. Peroxidation was shown to increase as a function of increasing membrane rigidity (23McLean L.R. Hagaman K.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 12: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Similar effects have been observed in model membranes prepared from distearoylphosphatidylcholine (25Mowri H. Nojima S. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (33Cervato G. Viani P. Masserini M. Di Iorio C. Cestaro B. Chem. Phys.

Lipids. 1990; 52: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cholesterol also influences the rate of lipid peroxidation in biological membranes. Based on its stereospecific interactions with component phospholipids, cholesterol has been shown to directly modulate membrane lipid order (35Yeagle P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 267-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar, 36Franks N.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 100: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Specifically, increasing membrane cholesterol content reduces the motional order of membrane lipids in the liquid-crystalline state and increases the motional order of membrane lipids in the gel state (24Leonard A. Dufourc E.J. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 37De Kruijff B. Cullis P.R. Radda G.K. Biochim. Biophys.

Consistent with these biophysical effects, cholesterol reduces the rate of lipid peroxidation below Tm and increases the rate of peroxidation above Tm (23McLean L.R. Hagaman K.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 12: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Mowri H. Nojima S. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cholesterol has also been shown to increase the amount of lipid peroxidation in liposomes exposed to γ-radiation, which increases membrane rigidity (39Nakazawa T. Nagatsuka S. Yukawa O. Drugs Exp. Clin. Res. 1986; 12: 831-835PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, cholesterol significantly increased lipid peroxidation in model membranes enriched in DLPC (Fig. 1). Since the Tm for DLPC is -53 °C, cholesterol would be expected to increase membrane rigidity at physiologic conditions, an effect also confirmed in this study by measurement of cholesterol-induced changes in membrane width (Figs. 2 and 6). These results are consistent with the idea that cholesterol increases the lateral packing of phospholipid acyl chains, facilitating the propagation of free radicals through the lipid bilayer.

https://openalex.org/W2024983955,"It is becoming increasingly recognized that hydrogen peroxide (HP) plays a role in cell proliferation and migration. In the present study we found that exogenous HP significantly induced human prostate cancer LNCaP cell proliferation and migration. Heparin affin regulatory peptide (HARP) seems to be involved in the stimulatory effect of HP, because the latter had no effect on stably transfected LNCaP cells that did not express HARP. Moreover, HP significantly increased HARP mRNA and protein amounts in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Curcumin and activator protein-1 (AP-1) decoy oligonucleotides abrogated both HP-induced HARP expression and LNCaP cell proliferation and migration. HP increased luciferase activity of the 5′-flanking region of the HARP gene introduced in a reporter gene vector, an effect that was abolished when even one of the two putative AP-1 binding sites of the HARP promoter was mutated. The effect of HP seems to be due to the binding of Fra-1, JunD, and phospho-c-Jun to the HARP promoter. These results support the notion that HARP is important for human prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration, establish the role of AP-1 in the up-regulation of HARP expression by low concentrations of HP, and characterize the AP-1 dimers involved.

A growing body of evidence correlates the production of reactive oxygen species with many aspects of cellular functions (1Dröge W. Physiol.

Of these, HP has the chemical stability required to establish significant steady-state concentrations in vivo (2Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol.

Small quantities of HP are produced by all types of cells, and several signal transduction pathways in mammalian cells have been reported to be activated by HP, such as tyrosine kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinases, protein kinase C, the epidermal growth factor receptor, protein phosphatases, potassium channels, and the transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1), and nuclear factor κB (reviewed in ref. 1Dröge W.

Heparin affin regulatory peptide (HARP), also called pleiotrophin or heparin-binding growth-associated molecule, is an 18-kDa secreted growth factor that displays high affinity for heparin. A growing body of evidence indicates that HARP is involved in cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation and plays a significant role in several cellular processes (5Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T. Cancer Lett. 2004; 204: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 6Papadimitriou E. Polykratis A. Hatziapostolou M. Parthymou A. Polytarchou C. Mikelis C. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HARP seems to play a major role in physiological as well as tumor angiogenesis and is detected in various carcinomas, such as human breast and prostate cancer, neuroblastomas, gliomas, benign meningiomas, and small cell lung cancer and mammary tumors, exhibiting a proto-oncogene function (5Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T. Cancer Lett. 2004; 204: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 6Papadimitriou E. Polykratis A. Hatziapostolou M. Parthymou A. Polytarchou C. Mikelis C. Curr.

Prostate. 2005; 65: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). HARP is highly conserved among human, rat, bovine, and mouse species, and its gene is expressed in a highly restricted temporal and spatial pattern during development, suggesting that HARP may be an important protein that potentially contributes to a number of different regulating systems (6Papadimitriou E. Polykratis A. Hatziapostolou M. Parthymou A. Polytarchou C. Mikelis C. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the regulation of its expression. When the promoter region of HARP gene was first cloned in 1992, no binding sites for known general transcription factors in the immediate promoter region were detected, although two potential AP-1 sites were found in the distal 5′-promoter region (9Li Y.S. Hoffman R.M. Le Beau M.M. Espinosa R. Jenkins III, N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26011-26016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently, HARP has been identified as a direct transcriptional target of HOXA5, a transcription factor with important roles in embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, and tumorigenesis (10Chen H. Rubin E. Zhang H. Chung S. Jie C.C. Garrett E. Biswal S. Sukumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19373-19380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of low concentrations of HP on human prostate cancer LNCaP cell proliferation and migration and to investigate whether HARP is involved in these effects. Our results argue for an HP-induced, AP-1-dependent transcriptional up-regulation of the human HARP gene, resulting in increased LNCaP cell proliferation and migration. Cell Culture—The human prostate cancer epithelial cell line LNCaP (American Type Culture Collection) was grown routinely in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml gentamycin and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity. Generation of Human HARP Luciferase Reporter Constructs—Human genomic DNA was isolated from LNCaP cells using a genomic DNA mini kit (Geneaid Biotech Ltd., Taoyuan, Taiwan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To produce a construct that contains the region -1984 bp to +280 bp of the translational start site of the human HARP gene (GenBank™ accession number X65451), a fragment containing ∼2.3 kb of the human HARP 5′-flanking region was amplified by PCR using primers containing restriction sites (boldfaced) for MluI (5′-ATACGCGTTGTCGACTCGATCCAAGAACC-3′; sense) and BglII (5′-GCAGATCTGTTTGAGTTGGAAACGTCCTCTC-3′; antisense). The fragment was ligated to a pGL3-basic firefly luciferase reporter gene vector (Promega, WI), giving rise to the plasmid hHARPpro2.3-Luc. The entire sequence of the inserted HARP 5′-flanking region was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Macrogen Inc.). To produce mutants of the putative AP-1 binding sites (9Li Y.S. Hoffman R.M. Le Beau M.M. Espinosa R. Jenkins III, N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26011-26016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hHARPpro2.3-Luc was used for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To produce the desired mutations at positions -1736 and -1405, two pairs of mutagenic primers, 5-TGTATACAATTTTAGTATATACCCATCTAAATAAAGGGTGATATTTTTGGTGTAAC-3 (sense) and 5-CACACTTTATACAGGTGAA ATCTAATTAAAACAAGCACTGCTTGCT-3 (sense), respectively, were used. After the annealing of the mutagenesis primers, the strands were completed with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase, and the parental double-stranded DNA was digested by DpnI. The resultant DNA digest was transformed into XL1-Blue super competent bacteria cell line. Colonies were expanded, and the plasmid DNA was harvested using the Nucleospin plasmid kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutations of the insert were verified by DNA sequence analysis (Macrogen). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—LNCaP cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant constructs containing the luciferase reporter gene using jetPEI™ (Polyplus Transfection). At 80% confluency, cells were incubated with 3 μg of DNA and 9.6 μl of jetPEI™ reagent in 2 ml of serum-free medium per well in 6-well plates for 4 h at 37 °C. After removing the transfection medium, FBS was added to a final concentration of 2%. After 24 h, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing HP. Cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase reporter gene assay from Roche Applied Science. Cell lysates were analyzed for protein content using the Bradford method, and luminescence units were normalized for total protein content. Decoy Oligonucleotide (ODN) Technique—Double-stranded ODNs were prepared from complementary single-stranded phosphorothioate-bonded ODNs (Biopaths) by melting at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by a cool down phase of 3 h at theambient temperature. The efficiency of the hybridization reaction was verified with 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and was always found to exceed 95%. The sequences of the single-stranded ODNs were 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′ for AP-1 and 5′-CGCTTGATTACTTAGCCGGAA-3′ for mutant AP-1 (underlined letters denote phosphorothioate-bonded bases; boldfaced letters denote the consensus and mutated AP-1 binding sites, respectively). ODN uptake was achieved using jetPEI™ according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded at 80% confluency, and 24 h later uptake was performed using ODNs and 6 μl of jetPEI™ Reagent in 1 ml of serum-free medium. The maximally effective concentration of ODNs was determined to be 450 nm, and the optimal incubation time with the cells was 4 h. Cell Proliferation Assay—To measure the number of cells, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dimethyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used as described previously (8Hatziapostolou M. Delbe J. Katsoris P. Polytarchou C. Courty J. Papadimitriou E. Prostate. 2005; 65: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). LNCaP cells were seeded at 5 × 103 cells/well (or 20 × 103 cells/well for the experiments using ODNs) in 24-well tissue culture plates in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. Twenty-four hours later, cells were starved in medium supplemented with 2% FBS for 16 h (when applicable, ODN uptake was performed as described above 4 h before the starvation period). The substances being tested were added, and the number of cells was determined after 48 h. Results were always confirmed by direct counting of cells under the microscope using a standard hemocytometer. Migration Assay—Migration assays were performed as described previously (8Hatziapostolou M. Delbe J. Katsoris P. Polytarchou C. Courty J. Papadimitriou E. Prostate. 2005; 65: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in 24-well microchemotaxis chambers (Costar, Avon, France) using uncoated polycarbonate membranes with 8-μm pores. Briefly, LNCaP cells were harvested and resuspended at 104 cells per 0.1 ml in RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The bottom chamber of each transwell unit contained 0.6 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% FBS. The plates were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C, and the filters were fixed with saline-buffered formalin and stained with 0.33% toluidine blue solution. The cells that migrated through the filter were quantified by counting the entire area of each filter by using a grid and an Optech microscope at a 20× magnification. For the experiments using ODNs, cells were pre-incubated with ODNs for 4 h. Evaluation of DNA Binding Activity of AP-1 by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—The DNA binding activity of AP-1 was quantified by ELISA using the TransAM™ AP-1 transcription factor family assay kit (Active Motif Europe), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, nuclear extracts were prepared using a nuclear extract kit from Active Motif Europe and incubated in 96-well plates coated with immobilized oligonucleotide containing a consensus binding site for AP-1 (wild-type TPA response element). AP-1 binding to the target oligonucleotide was detected by incubation with primary antibodies specific for c-Fos, Fos-B, Fra-1, Fra-2, JunB, JunD, or the activated form of c-Jun, visualized with anti-IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate and developing solution, and quantified at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 655 nm. For the competition analyses, nuclear extracts were pre-incubated with the AP-1 like motifs of the HARP promoter and the respective mutated sequences or the wild type TPA response element. Western Blot Analysis for HARP—The presence of HARP in the cell culture medium was investigated as described previously (8Hatziapostolou M. Delbe J. Katsoris P. Polytarchou C. Courty J. Papadimitriou E. Prostate. 2005; 65: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The conditioned medium of the cells was incubated overnight with 100 μl of heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C with continuous agitation. Bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer under reducing conditions, fractionated by electrophoresis on 17.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to Immobilon P membranes. Blocking was performed by incubating the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T). The membranes were then incubated with 45 ng/ml affinity purified anti-HARP antibody in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature under continuous agitation and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:7.500 in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature under continuous agitation. Detection of HARP was performed by the ChemiLucent™ detection system kit (Chemicon International Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein levels that corresponded to HARP were quantified using the ImagePC image analysis software (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD). Results were normalized against total protein amounts. Total RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase-PCRs—Total RNA was extracted from LNCaP cells using the NucleoSpin® RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcriptase-PCRs were performed using the Access reverse transcriptase-PCR system (Promega) as described previously (8Hatziapostolou M. Delbe J. Katsoris P. Polytarchou C. Courty J. Papadimitriou E. Prostate. 2005; 65: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Primers used for human HARP and β-actin were described previously (8Hatziapostolou M. Delbe J. Katsoris P. Polytarchou C. Courty J. Papadimitriou E. Prostate. 2005; 65: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The reverse transcriptase-PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and photographed using a digital camera. The ratio of electrophoretic band values of HARP versus β-actin represents the relative expression of HARP gene after different treatments of cells. Statistical Analysis—The significance of variability between the results of each group and its corresponding control was determined by unpaired t test. Each experiment included triplicate measurements for each condition tested unless otherwise indicated. All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. Effect of HP on LNCaP Cell Proliferation and Migration—We have recently shown that HP increases angiogenesis in vivo (11Polytarchou C. Papadimitriou E. Free Radic. Res. 2004; 38: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and human endothelial cell proliferation and migration in vitro (12Polytarchou C. Papadimitriou E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 5: 31-38Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the present work, we studied the effect of HP on proliferation and migration of human prostate cancer LNCaP cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, HP significantly increased the number of LNCaP cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with the maximum effect (70 ± 9% increase) observed at 5 μm. Concentrations of HP higher than 10 μM were toxic for the cells (data not shown). Similarly, HP significantly induced LNCaP cell migration (51 ± 14% increase) at the concentration of 5 μm (Fig. 1B). HARP Expression Is Required for HP-induced LNCaP Proliferation and Migration—We have recently shown that endogenous HARP expression plays a key role in LNCaP cell proliferation and migration (8Hatziapostolou M. Delbe J. Katsoris P. Polytarchou C. Courty J. Papadimitriou E. Prostate. 2005; 65: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of HARP in HP-induced LNCaP cell proliferation and migration, we used LNCaP cells expressing either antisense HARP (AS-LNCaP) or the appropriate control vector (PC-LNCaP), as described previously (8Hatziapostolou M. Delbe J. Katsoris P. Polytarchou C. Courty J. Papadimitriou E. Prostate. 2005; 65: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). HP significantly increased PC-LNCaP cell proliferation and migration, similar to its effect on non-transfected LNCaP cells. In contrast, it had no effect on AS-LNCaP cell proliferation or migration (Fig. 1). HP Increases the Expression and Secretion of HARP by LNCaP Cells— To determine whether HP affects HARP expression by LNCaP cells, we incubated the cells with HP and measured both protein and mRNA amounts of HARP at different time points after the addition of different concentrations of HP into the cell culture medium. HARP protein levels secreted into the culture medium of LNCaP cells were significantly increased in a concentration-dependent manner 24 h after the addition of HP. The effect was observed after the first 6 h after addition of HP into the cell culture medium and was maximal at 24 h (data not shown). Similarly, HARP mRNA levels were also increased 3 and 5 h after the addition of HP into the culture medium of LNCaP cells (Fig. 2). Curcumin and AP-1 ODNs Abolish HP-induced HARP Expression and Secretion—AP-1 is generally considered to be a redox-regulated transcription factor complex. Because it has been suggested that HARP promoter may contain two putative AP-1 binding sites (6Papadimitriou E. Polykratis A. Hatziapostolou M. Parthymou A. Polytarchou C. Mikelis C. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Li Y.S. Hoffman R.M. Le Beau M.M. Espinosa R. Jenkins III, N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26011-26016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated a possible role of AP-1 in the HP-induced HARP up-regulation. Curcumin, a c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)/AP-1 inhibitor (13Kumar A. Kingdon E. Norman J. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 443-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), completely attenuated HP-induced HARP mRNA and protein up-regulation (Fig. 3) and LNCaP cell proliferation and migration (Fig. 4). In the same line, transfection of LNCaP cells with AP-1 ODNs prior to stimulation with HP resulted in marked attenuation of HP-induced mRNA and protein up-regulation (Fig. 3) as well as LNCaP cell proliferation and migration (Fig. 4). ODNs containing a mutated AP-1 consensus sequence had no effect on HP-induced protein up-regulation (Fig. 3) and did not attenuate HP-induced LNCaP cell proliferation and migration (Fig. 4). HP-stimulated proliferation, however, appeared reduced in the presence of ODNs containing mutated AP-1 consensus sequence (Fig. 4A). This result may be attributed to nonspecific effects of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides such as a nonspecific blockade of cell surface receptor activity or interference with other proteins, resulting in a non-sequence-specific inhibitory effect on cell proliferation as described previously (14Morishita R. Tomita N. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4AP-1 inhibition abolishes HP-induced LNCaP cell proliferation (A) and migration (B). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of the number of cells.

For this reason, we made a plasmid construct containing the full-length promoter (2.3 kb) of the human HARP gene fused to a luciferase reporter gene (hHARPpro2.3-Luc; Fig. 5A) and used it to transfect LNCaP cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reporter activity was increased in response to HP in LNCaP cells after the first 2 h following the addition of HP into the cell culture medium and was maximal at 6 h (Fig. 5B). We next evaluated the contribution of the two putative AP-1-like motifs of the HARP promoter to the increased transcription of HARP gene in HP-stimulated LNCaP cells. For this reason, we made constructs with point mutations in either one (AP-1 mutant-I and AP-1 mutant-II) or both (AP-1 double mutant) AP-1-like motifs, as shown in Fig. 6A. The reporter activities of both AP-1 mutant-I and AP-1 mutant-II, as well as AP-1 double mutant, were significantly lower in non-stimulated cells. Moreover, HP had no effect on the reporter activity (Fig. 6B), suggesting a pivotal role of these two motifs in both basal and HP-stimulated transcription of HARP gene in LNCaP cells. HP Activates AP-1 Subunits—AP-1-subunit-specific ELISA analysis of nuclear extracts derived from unstimulated and HP-stimulated LNCaP cells was used to evaluate the modification of DNA binding activity of different subunits of AP-1. Fra-1, c-Fos, JunD, and phospho-c-Jun DNA binding activity were up-regulated 5 h post stimulation of LNCaP cells with HP (Fig. 7A). HP Induces the Binding Activity of Phospho-c-Jun, JunD, and Fra-1 on HARP Promoter—Having demonstrated that AP-1-like motifs are implicated in the up-regulation of HARP promoter activity upon stimulation with HP, we went on to determine the possible AP-1 subunits that constitute the active complex on HARP promoter. Therefore, a competitive ELISA was performed using soluble double-stranded oligonucleotides that corresponded to either the wild-type or the mutated AP-1 binding like motifs of the HARP promoter. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the wild-type TPA response element sequence were also used. When the AP-1 binding-like motifs of the HARP promoter were used, Fra-1, phospho-c-Jun and JunD binding was significantly decreased, whereas the binding of c-Fos, FosB, Fra-2, and JunB was not affected. Mutated AP-1 binding like motifs of the HARP promoter had no effect (Fig. 7B). When the TPA response element sequence was used, binding of all subunits was decreased up to 90% (data not shown). HARP is an 18-kDa heparin binding growth factor that has a potent role in angiogenesis and tumor growth, although very little is known about the regulation of its expression (6Papadimitriou E. Polykratis A. Hatziapostolou M. Parthymou A. Polytarchou C. Mikelis C. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the present work, we studied the mechanisms of regulation of HARP expression by HP that lead to increased prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration. To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows the involvement of AP-1 in the signaling mediated by low concentrations of HP, although the involvement of AP-1 in the apoptotic effects of increased concentrations of HP is well documented (15Benhar M. Engelberg D. Levitzki A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). HP stimulated LNCaP cell proliferation and migration in a concentration-dependent manner, in agreement with previous studies that support the stimulatory effect of either exogenously added or enzymatically produced HP on tumor growth and metastatic potential as well as on the mitotic and migratory rate of normal cells (12Polytarchou C. Papadimitriou E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 5: 31-38Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Stone J.R. Collins T. Endothelium. 2002; 9: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 17Laurent A.

The causative correlation of HP to the proliferation and migration of LNCaP cells is in line with and extends the notion that cell lines developed from LNCaP demonstrate increasing tumor and metastatic potential, in combination with a parallel increase in HP levels (18Lim S.D. Sun C. Lambeth J.D. Marshall F. Amin M. Chung L. Petros J.A. Arnold R.S. Prostate. 2005; 62: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Using an antisense strategy, we have recently identified HARP as an important autocrine growth factor for human prostate cancer LNCaP cells (8Hatziapostolou M. Delbe J. Katsoris P. Polytarchou C. Courty J. Papadimitriou E. Prostate. 2005; 65: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the present study, using LNCaP cells expressing antisense HARP, we sought to evaluate the possible role of HARP in HP-induced LNCaP cell proliferation and migration. HP stimulatory effects were abolished in AS-LNCaP cells, pointing at the necessity of HARP expression for HP-stimulated LNCaP cell proliferation and migration. Our hypothesis of an interventional role of HARP in HP effects was reinforced by the observation that HP resulted in increased HARP mRNA and protein levels in LNCaP cells. To investigate a possible role of AP-1 in the biological phenomena triggered in LNCaP cells by low concentrations of HP, AP-1 activity was inhibited by using curcumin or AP-1 ODNs. The inhibition of HP-induced HARP expression and secretion, as well as LNCaP cell proliferation and migration, suggest a positive correlation between moderate HP concentration, AP-1 activity, HARP expression, and LNCaP cell functions. This notion is in line with previous studies that propose a proliferative and migratory effect of AP-1 complexes in different cell types (19Oktay M. Wary K.K. Dans M. Birge R.B. Giancotti F.G. J.

The finding that HP treatment resulted in increased HARP mRNA and secreted protein levels, an effect that was reversed by AP-1 inhibition, indicated a probable transcriptional control mechanism. To corroborate this hypothesis, a reporter gene vector carrying the full-length promoter of HARP gene was constructed. The 5′-flanking nucleotide sequence of the human HARP gene promoter contains two putative AP-1-like binding sites (9Li Y.S. Hoffman R.M. Le Beau M.M. Espinosa R. Jenkins III, N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26011-26016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which seem to be involved in AP-1 mediated regulation of human HARP expression (this study). These two sites are located in the distal 5′-promoter region from -1737 to -1731 and -1406 to -1400, respectively. Such a cluster region for AP-1 responsive elements was also described for the human γ-glutamyltransferase (22Daubeuf S. Duvoix A. Wellman-Rousseau M. Diederich M. Visvikis A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In the HARP gene promoter, AP-1-like binding sites were found to be similar in their ability to confer HP-mediated inducibility. Point mutation analyses revealed the requirement of both sites for the transcriptional up-regulation of HARP in HP-treated LNCaP cells. Furthermore, both AP-1 sites are implicated in the transcription of HARP at the basal non-induced state. The binding of AP-1 to the corresponding sites of the HARP promoter most likely reflects the absolute requirement of a sequence containing the trinucleotide TGA, because a single mutation in the second base (G) was enough to inhibit the modulation of endogenous transcriptional regulation. Our data are in accordance with previous studies showing that oligonucleotides carrying similar sequences allowed the binding of AP-1 complexes, a phenomenon reversed when point mutations in the first triplet were introduced (25Bianchi L. Tacchini L. Matteucci E. Desiderio M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 401: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Various signal transduction pathways are linked to AP-1 in a manner controlled by upstream kinases, leading to both enhanced expression and/or interactions with other transcriptional regulators and resulting in AP-1 activity modulation (26Deng T. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 371: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 27Han T.H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). AP-1 proteins contain basic leucine zipper domains and act as a variety of homodimers or heterodimers composed of members of the Fos, Jun, and ATF families (29Pognonec P. Boulukos K.E. Aperlo C. Fujimoto M. Ariga H. Nomoto A. Kato H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2091-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 30Van Dam H. Castellazzi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2453-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Jun proteins can form both homodimers and heterodimers, whereas Fos proteins form only heterodimers. In the present study, we demonstrate that low concentrations of HP are able to increase the binding activity of different Jun and Fos family members. Interestingly, the AP-1 complexes that bind to the corresponding sites of the HARP promoter consist of Fra-1, JunD, and c-Jun. Thus, three kinds of AP-1 complexes are most likely involved in the HP-stimulated HARP transcriptional activation, namely Fra-1·JunD, Fra-1·c-Jun, and c-Jun·JunD. These results come in line and extend the most recent notion that, in mouse fibroblasts, HARP expression is up-regulated by Jun (31Florin L. Maas-Szabowski N. Werner S. Szabowski A. Angel P. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1981-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HARP expression is also regulated by Fra-1, a member of the AP-1 family that seems to regulate genes that are required for migration/invasion (21Milde-Langosch K. Roder H. Andritzky B.

Three distinct mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinase modules, including JNK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, have been characterized as upstream kinases modifying AP-1 activity (37Eferl R. Wagner E.F. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). The inhibition of HP-stimulated HARP expression by curcumin (a JNK inhibitor) suggests that the JNK signal transduction pathway may be involved. Moreover, preliminary data show the requirement of ERK activity for HP-induced HARP expression in human endothelial cells. 3C. Polytarchou, M. Hatziapostolou, and E. Papadimitriou, unpublished data. Taken together, it would be tempting to speculate that AP-1-mediated HARP up-regulation is mediated by a coordinated activation of JNK and ERK signal transduction pathways. In conclusion, under non-stress conditions HP exerts proliferative and migratory effects on LNCaP cells through up-regulation of HARP expression. The present study is the first to demonstrate the involvement of AP-1 response elements in the transcriptional regulation of the human HARP gene. Our data suggest that HARP gene is redox-sensitive and that HP-induced HARP expression is due to binding of specific AP-1 complexes to both of the AP-1 responsive sites of the promoter of HARP.

https://openalex.org/W2021553547,"Although dimerization appears to be a common property of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), it remains unclear whether a GPCR dimer binds one or two molecules of ligand and whether ligand binding results in activation of one or two G-proteins when measured using functional assays in intact living cells. Previously, we demonstrated that serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine2C (5-HT2C) receptors form homodimers (Herrick-Davis, K., Grinde, E., and Mazurkiewicz, J. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 13963-13971). In the present study, an inactive 5-HT2C receptor was created and coexpressed with wild-type 5-HT2C receptors to determine whether dimerization regulates receptor function and to determine the ligand/dimer/G-protein stoichiometry in living cells. Mutagenesis of Ser138 to Arg (S138R) produced a 5-HT2C receptor incapable of binding ligand or stimulating inositol phosphate (IP) signaling. Confocal fluorescence imaging revealed plasma membrane expression of yellow fluorescent protein-tagged S138R receptors. Expression of wild-type 5-HT2C receptors in an S138R-expressing stable cell line had no effect on ligand binding to wild-type 5-HT2C receptors, but inhibited basal and 5-HT-stimulated IP signaling as well as constitutive and 5-HT-stimulated endocytosis of wild-type 5-HT2C receptors. M1 muscarinic receptor activation of IP production was normal in the S138R-expressing cells. Heterodimerization of S138R with wild-type 5-HT2C receptors was visualized in living cells using confocal fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). FRET was dependent on the donor/acceptor ratio and independent of the receptor expression level. Therefore, inactive 5-HT2C receptors inhibit wild-type 5-HT2C receptor function by forming nonfunctional heterodimers expressed on the plasma membrane. These results are consistent with a model in which one GPCR dimer binds two molecules of ligand and one G-protein and indicate that dimerization is essential for 5-HT receptor function.

Recent studies investigating GPCR structure and function indicate that they form dimeric or oligomeric complexes. Homodimerization and heterodimerization between different families of GPCRs have been reported to regulate ligand binding, second messenger activation, and receptor trafficking (reviewed in Ref. 1Terrillon A. Bouvier M. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). GPCR dimerization has been reported to involve the N-terminal domain, transmembrane domains, and the C-terminal domain of interacting receptors, and agonists have been reported to increase or decrease or to have no effect on GPCR dimerization (reviewed in Refs. 2Angers S.

Although these studies indicate that dimerization may be a common property of GPCRs, the specific mechanisms and functional consequences of dimerization may be vastly different from one GPCR family to another. In the case of γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptors, the functional significance of dimerization is very clear. Heterodimerization between γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptors 1 and 2 is essential for trafficking and expression of functional receptors on the plasma membrane (5Jones K.A. Borowsky B. Tamm J.A.

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) receptors represent one of the largest subfamilies of GPCRs. There are 14 different 5-HT receptor subtypes widely distributed throughout the peripheral and central nervous systems, representing therapeutic targets for drugs used to treat anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, migraine, emesis, and other disorders (reviewed in Refs. 8Hoyer D.

Psychopharmacology. 2004; 174: 17-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If dimerization plays a role in regulating the function of 5-HT receptors, it could have important implications for the development of novel serotonergic therapeutic agents. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments suggest that 5-HT1 receptors may form homodimers and heterodimers (10Xie Z. Lee S.P. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R.

Previously, we used biochemical and biophysical techniques to demonstrate that 5-HT2C receptors are present as constitutive homodimers on the plasma membrane of living human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (12Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Mazurkiewicz J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13963-13971Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of 5-HT receptor dimerization (if any) remains unknown. Also, it remains unclear whether a GPCR dimer binds one or two molecules of ligand and whether ligand binding results in receptor dimer activation of one or two G-proteins when measured using functional assays in an intact cell system. In this study, radioligand binding, inositol phosphate (IP) signaling, confocal imaging of receptor endocytosis, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) were evaluated in HEK293 cells coexpressing wild-type and inactive mutant S138R 5-HT2C receptors to determine the effect of dimerization on receptor function and to determine the ligand/dimer/G-protein stoichiometry. The results of this study show that S138R receptors form heterodimers with wild-type 5-HT2C receptors in living cells and have an inhibitory effect on 5-HT2C receptor function. Previous studies have reported a dominant-negative effect of splice variant, truncated, or mutant receptors on wild-type receptor function through heterodimerization, resulting in trapping of wild-type receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum (13Grosse R.

In contrast, our study describes a dominant-negative effect of an inactive mutant GPCR on wild-type receptor function through heterodimerization, resulting in the expression of nonfunctional receptor complexes on the plasma membrane.

We tested this model in intact living cells following coexpression of wild-type and inactive 5-HT2C receptors. Our results suggest that each GPCR dimer binds two molecules of ligand, resulting in the activation of one G-protein, and indicate that dimerization is essential for 5-HT receptor function. Cell Culture—HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; CellGro) with 10% fetal bovine serum (CellGro) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were plated at 5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid DNAs using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) for 5 h at 37°C in serum-free medium and then returned to DMEM with serum. All experiments were performed 36-42 h post-transfection, and cells were cultured in serum-free medium for the final 16 h prior to the experiment. cDNAs—The human 5-HT2C-VSV receptor cDNA (from Dr. Elaine Sanders-Bush) was used as the starting template for creating receptor fusion proteins and for site-directed mutagenesis to create the mutant S138R receptor. The S138R mutation in the 5-HT2C receptor was created by PCR following the Stratagene protocol using complementary sense and antisense primers to nucleotides 404-427 of the human 5-HT2C receptor open reading frame, with the exception of nucleotides 413-415, which were changed to CGT to code for arginine instead of serine. The M1 muscarinic receptor was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA. Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), and hemagglutinin (HA) tags were attached to the C-terminal end of S138R and wild-type 5-HT2C receptor cDNAs to create 5-HT2C/CFP, 5-HT2C/YFP, and 5-HT2C/HA fusion proteins as described previously (12Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Mazurkiewicz J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13963-13971Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). S138R and wild-type 5-HT2C receptor cDNAs were ligated into the pECFP-N1 and/or pEYFP-N1 vector (Clontech), and the M1 muscarinic receptor was ligated into pcDNA3 (Clontech). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Center for Functional Genomics, Albany, NY). S138R 5-HT2C/YFP-expressing Stable Cell Line—A stable cell line expressing S138R 5-HT2C/YFP was created by transfecting 2 × 106 HEK293 cells with 10 μg of S138R 5-HT2C/YFP plasmid DNA by calcium phosphate precipitation. Two days post-transfection, cells were cultured in DMEM containing 400 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. Colonies expressing YFP-tagged S138R receptors on the plasma membrane were identified by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Radioligand Binding—HEK293 cells (4 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were transfected with 0.5 μg of S138R or wild-type 5-HT2C receptor plasmid DNA using 20 μl of Lipofectamine. For saturation experiments, HEK293 and S138R-expressing stable cells were transfected with 0.2 or 0.5 μg of wild-type 5-HT2C receptor plasmid DNA. Membranes were prepared from transfected cells as described previously (23Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Niswender C.M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Saturation experiments were performed using [3H]mesulergine (0.1-5 nm) in the presence and absence of 1 μm mianserin in 0.5 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% ascorbate) with 0.5 ml of diluted cell membranes (10 μg of protein/assay tube). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by filtration through glass fiber filters (Schleicher & Schüll) on a Brandel cell harvester and liquid scintillation counting in Ecoscint (National Diagnostics). Protein was determined using BCA (Pierce). Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. IP Assay—For IP assays, HEK293 or S138R-expressing stable cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates (Biocoat, Inc.) and transfected 3 h later with 5-HT2C or M1 muscarinic receptor plasmid DNA (25 ng/well) and Lipofectamine (1 μl/well). For IP assays performed in parallel with the radioligand binding assays, 4 × 106 cells/100-mm dish were transfected with 0.2 μg of 5-HT2C receptor plasmid DNA: half the dish was used for the radioligand binding assay, and the other half was replated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates for the IP assay. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, 0.5 μCi of [3H]myoinositol in inositol-free, serum-free DMEM was added to each well for an additional 16 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in serum-free DMEM with lithium chloride in the absence or presence of agonist for 35 min. Total [3H]IP production was measured by anion exchange chromatography as described previously (24Herrick-Davis K. Egan C. Teitler M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. Confocal Microscopy—HEK293 cells (4 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were transfected with 0.2 μg of wild-type or S138R 5-HT2C/YFP plasmid DNA using 20 μl of Lipofectamine. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were plated overnight in serum-free medium on polylysine-coated glass coverslips. The cells were viewed live in phosphate-buffered saline on a Noran Oz confocal microscope system using a Nikon Diaphot 200 inverted microscope with a ×60, 1.4-numerical aperture oil immersion objective. The 488-nm laser line from a krypton/argon laser was used to excite YFP, and fluorescence was imaged with a 488-nm dichroic mirror and a 500-nm long-pass filter. Time-lapse images were collected every 15 s over a 10-min period. After 10 min, 10 μm 5-HT was added to the cells, and images were collected every 15 s for 10 min. HEK293 cells coexpressing wild-type 5-HT2C/CFP and S138R 5-HT2C/YFP were viewed using a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal imaging system with linear unmixing of CFP and YFP emission spectra following excitation at 458 nm using the same conditions and settings as described for the FRET experiments. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—HEK293 cells (4 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were transfected with 1 μg of the indicated plasmid DNAs using 20 μl of Lipofectamine. For control experiments, cells were transfected independently with either 5-HT2C/YFP or 5-HT2C/HA and mixed together after transfection. Cross-linking of receptors was performed by incubating intact cells in 5 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (a cell membrane-impermeable cross-linker; Pierce) for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were lysed, and membranes were solubilized in 10 mm CHAPS as described previously (12Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Mazurkiewicz J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13963-13971Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Solubilized membrane proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight with 10 μl of anti-HA (Y-11) antibody-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) as described previously (12Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Mazurkiewicz J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13963-13971Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 1× nonreducing Laemmli sample buffer and heated at 70 °C for 10 min, and 10-μl samples were run on a 10% Tris-HCl Ready Gel (Bio-Rad). Blots were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-green fluorescent protein (B-2) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted 1:3000 and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. FRET—HEK293 cells (4 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were cotransfected with S138R 5-HT2C/CFP (donor) and wild-type 5-HT2C/YFP (acceptor) or with wild-type 5-HT2C/CFP (donor) and wild-type 5-HT2C/YFP (acceptor) at a donor/acceptor ratio of 1:1 (0.4 μg + 0.4 μg of plasmid DNA) or 1:2 (0.3 μg + 0.6 μg of plasmid DNA) using 20 μlof Lipofectamine. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were plated overnight in serum-free medium on polylysine-coated glass coverslips prior to the FRET assay. The cells were viewed live in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature using a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal imaging system with a 30-milliwatt argon laser and a ×63, 1.4-numerical aperture oil immersion objective at ×2 zoom. CFP and YFP emission spectra were collected (from cells expressing 5-HT2C/CFP or 5-HT2C/YFP alone) following excitation at 458 nm and were used as reference spectra for linear unmixing of CFP and YFP emission spectra in cotransfected cells using the Zeiss META detector and Zeiss AIM software as described previously (12Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Mazurkiewicz J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13963-13971Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). FRET was measured by acceptor photobleaching (25Bastiaens P.I.H. Majoul I.V. Verveer P.J. Söling H.D. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy was used to visualize a 2-μm optical slice through the middle of a living HEK293 cell expressing both 5-HT2C/CFP and 5-HT2C/YFP. A small region of plasma membrane (typically 3-4 μm in length) was selected for photobleaching. Pre-bleach CFP and YFP images were collected simultaneously following excitation at 458 nm (38% laser intensity, detector gain = 740). The selected region of plasma membrane was irradiated with the 514-nm laser line (100% intensity, 60 iterations, using a 458/514-nm dual dichroic mirror) for 10 s to photobleach YFP, typically resulting in a 95% decrease in YFP fluorescence. Post-bleach CFP and YFP images were collected simultaneously (at 458 nm) within 1 s following photobleaching. In an independent experiment, YFP fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was measured and found to be negligible 1 s following photobleaching. The short photobleach time and the automated rapid collection of pre- and post-bleach images make this technique suitable for use in living cells. FRET was measured as an increase in CFP fluorescence intensity (donor dequenching) following YFP (acceptor) photobleaching. FRET efficiency was calculated as 100 × ((CFP post-bleach - CFP pre-bleach)/CFP post-bleach) using the FRET macro in the Zeiss AIM software package, taking into account CFP and YFP background noise in each channel. FRET efficiencies were calculated in cells expressing both CFP and YFP, in cells expressing CFP alone, and in non-bleached regions of the cell membrane as a control. Mutation of Ser138 to Arg Produces an Inactive Form of the 5-HT2C Receptor—Site-directed mutagenesis was used to create an inactive form of the 5-HT2C receptor to test the hypothesis that 5-HT2C receptors function as dimeric or oligomeric complexes. Computer modeling and mutagenesis studies have provided evidence that Ser159 in transmembrane domain (TMD) III plays an important role in 5-HT binding to the 5-HT2A receptor (26Ebersole B.J. Visiers I. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, we mutated the analogous serine (amino acid 138) in the 5-HT2C receptor to arginine (S138R) in an attempt to create an inactive receptor. [3H]Mesulergine binding and IP production assays were used to evaluate receptor expression and function in HEK293 cells. Specific [3H]mesulergine binding was detected in cells transfected with plasmid containing wild-type 5-HT2C receptor cDNA, but not in cells transfected with plasmid containing S138R 5-HT2C receptor cDNA (Fig. 1). Similarly, 5-HT stimulated [3H]IP production in HEK293 cells transfected with plasmid containing wild-type 5-HT2C receptor cDNA, but not in cells transfected with plasmid containing S138R 5-HT2C receptor cDNA (Fig. 1). Although wild-type 5-HT2C receptors had moderate levels of basal activity in the IP assay, S138R receptors were devoid of basal activity. These results demonstrate that mutation of Ser138 to Arg eliminates the ability of the 5-HT2C receptor to bind ligand and to stimulate phospholipase C. Plasma Membrane Localization of S138R and Wild-type 5-HT2C Receptors—Fluorescently tagged 5-HT2C receptors were created to allow direct visualization of S138R and wild-type 5-HT2C receptors in living cells by confocal microscopy. A previous study has shown that a fluorescent tag (YFP) expressed as a fusion protein on the C terminus of the 5-HT2C receptor does not alter 5-HT binding affinity or potency (12Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Mazurkiewicz J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13963-13971Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). S138R or wild-type 5-HT2C/YFP fusion protein was expressed in HEK293 cells, and live time-lapse images were collected (Fig. 2, A-D). To assess receptor trafficking activity subsequent to delivery to the plasma membrane, receptor movement was monitored in the absence and presence of 5-HT. Time-lapse images were captured every 15 s over a 10-min period. In cells expressing wild-type 5-HT2C receptors, significant trafficking was observed between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments in the form of bidirectional vesicular movement. Selected frames from a representative time-lapse movie are illustrated in Fig. 2A. Within the first minute following the addition of 5-HT, vesicular trafficking increased, with a net increase in the retrograde movement of receptor-containing vesicles as evidenced by in an increase in the fluorescence intensity of the intracellular compartment. This was followed by an overall cellular shape change that was clearly evident 3 min after the addition of 5-HT (Fig. 2B). The increase in intracellular fluorescence intensity suggests the induction of down-regulation of ligand-bound receptor in the form of endocytosis. HEK293 cells expressing S138R 5-HT2C/YFP showed little or no observable receptor trafficking in the absence of 5-HT (Fig. 2C). Overall movement of the cell was observed, as would be expected from a living cell over a 10-min period. However, there was no significant receptor endocytosis subsequent to the addition 5-HT (Fig. 2D). When cells were cotransfected with wild-type 5-HT2C/CFP and S138R 5-HT2C/YFP, both wild-type and mutant receptors were expressed on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2E). The addition of 10 μm 5-HT produced a small increase in intracellular wild-type 5-HT2C/CFP fluorescence (Fig. 2F), in contrast to the large redistribution of wild-type 5-HT2C receptors observed when expressed in the absence of S138R receptors (Fig. 2B). There was no change in the distribution of S138R 5-HT2C/YFP fluorescence following the addition of 5-HT to the cotransfected cells (Fig. 2F). These results suggest that the ability of wild-type 5-HT2C receptors to respond to 5-HT stimulation is impaired when coexpressed with inactive S138R 5-HT2C receptors. S138R 5-HT2C Receptors Inhibit the Function of Wild-type 5-HT2C Receptors—Wild-type 5-HT2C receptors were expressed in HEK293 cells and in a stable cell line expressing S138R 5-HT2C receptors to determine whether wild-type 5-HT2C receptor function is altered when expressed in the presence of inactive S138R receptors. 5-HT dose-response curves for stimulation of IP production in HEK293 cells and in the S138R-expressing stable cell line transfected with equal amounts of wild-type 5-HT2C receptor plasmid DNA are shown in Fig. 3A. Although the 5-HT EC50 values for stimulation of IP production by wild-type 5-HT2C receptors expressed in HEK cells (1.3 ± 0.2 nm) and in S138R-expressing cells (2.3 ± 0.4 nm) were similar, 5-HT-stimulated IP production was drastically reduced in the S138R-expressing cells. Radioligand binding studies were performed to measure wild-type 5-HT2C receptor expression following transfection into the S138R-expressing stable cell line using the same transfection conditions as described for the IP assay. [3H]Mesulergine saturation analyses yielded Bmax values ranging from 4.1 to 5.0 pmol/mg of protein and KD values ranging from 0.8 to 1.0 nm in three independent transfection experiments. Additional radioligand binding studies were performed to compare wild-type 5-HT2C receptor expression levels in HEK293 cells and in the S138R-expressing stable cell line. Four saturation experiments were performed in parallel: two with 0.2 μg and two with 0.5 μg of wild-type 5-HT2C receptor plasmid DNA transfected into HEK293 cells or into the S138R-expressing stable cell line (Fig. 3B). Bmax values for 0.2 μg of wild-type 5-HT2C receptor plasmid DNA transfected into HEK293 and S138R-expressing stable cells were 4.9 and 4.1 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. Bmax values for 0.5 μg of native 5-HT2C receptor plasmid DNA transfected into HEK293 and S138R-expressing stable cells were 7.9 and 9.5 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. [3H]Mesulergine KD values were similar in all four saturation experiments and ranged from 0.7 to 1.0 nm. Because S138R receptors do not bind radioligand, the plasma membrane expression level of S138R receptors in the S138R 5-HT2C/YFP-expressing stable cell line was determined by fluorescence microscopy. Plasma membrane YFP fluorescence intensity in the S138R-expressing stable cell line (1573 ± 52, n = 64) was similar to that in the wild-type 5-HT2C/YFP-expressing stable cell line (1665 ± 50, n = 71) with a predetermined [3H]mes"
https://openalex.org/W2117471008,"We have recently shown that dinitrosyl diglutathionyl iron complex, a possible in vivo nitric oxide (NO) donor, binds with extraordinary affinity to one of the active sites of human glutathione transferase (GST) P1-1 and triggers negative cooperativity in the neighboring subunit of the dimer. This strong interaction has also been observed in the human Mu, Alpha, and Theta GST classes, suggesting a common mechanism by which GSTs may act as intracellular NO carriers or scavengers. We present here the crystal structure of GST P1-1 in complex with the dinitrosyl diglutathionyl iron ligand at high resolution. In this complex the active site Tyr-7 coordinates to the iron atom through its phenolate group by displacing one of the GSH ligands. The crucial importance of this catalytic residue in binding the nitric oxide donor is demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis of this residue with His, Cys, or Phe residues. The relative binding affinity for the complex is strongly reduced in all three mutants by about 3 orders of magnitude with respect to the wild type. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy studies on intact Escherichia coli cells expressing the recombinant GST P1-1 enzyme indicate that bacterial cells, in response to NO treatment, are able to form the dinitrosyl diglutathionyl iron complex using intracellular iron and GSH.

S-Nitrosylation of protein thiol groups by nitric oxide is accepted as being among the most important posttranslational modifications (1Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O.

Such modifications can cause modulation of many different functions with recent examples including proteins involved in signaling cascades, apoptosis, ion channels, redox systems, and hemoproteins (2Broillet M.-C.

In these cases the formation of iron-dithiol dinitrosyl complexes are readily detected by EPR spectroscopy.

The glutathione transferases (EC 2.5.1.18), historically also called glutathione S-transferases, catalyze the nucleophilic attack by reduced glutathione (GSH) on non-polar compounds that contain an electrophilic carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur atom. This classical conjugation reaction toward foreign compounds (e.g. cancer chemotherapeutic agents, insecticides, herbicides, carcinogens) and endogenous compounds (e.g. byproducts of oxidative stress) is considered part of a coordinated defense strategy together with other GSH-dependent enzymes, the cytochrome P450s (Phase I enzymes) and some membrane transporters (Phase III) such as MRP1 and MRP2, to remove glutathione conjugates from the cell. In mammals there are three major families of proteins widely distributed in nature that exhibit glutathione transferase activity. Two of these, the cytosolic and mitochondrial GSTs, comprise soluble enzymes, whereas the third family is microsomal and is referred to as MAPEG (membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione) metabolism (12Hayes D.H. Flanagan J.U. Jowsey I.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 51-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (2981) Google Scholar). The human cytosolic GSTs are dimeric proteins that can be grouped into at least seven gene-independent classes (Alpha, Mu, Pi, Sigma, Theta, Omega, and Zeta) on the basis of their amino acid sequence and immunological properties (13Mannervik B. Ålin P. Guthenberg C. Jensson H. Tahir M.K. Warholm M. Jörnvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7202-7206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 14Meyer D.J. Coles B. Pemble S.E.

Structural differences at the H-site confer a certain degree of substrate selectivity. Despite a common structure they appear to play multiple functions. For example, Zeta class GST Z1-1 is involved in the catabolism of phenylalanine (21Polekhina G. Board P.G. Blackburn A.C. Parker M.W.

In this paper we report the crystallographic structure of GST P1-1 with the DNDGIC bound in the active site, which together with site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrate a crucial role for the catalytic residue Tyr-7 acting as a ligand for the iron complex in the active site (Scheme 1). These data provide direct support that GSTs can be nitrosylated in vitro. Further studies on intact Escherichia coli cells upon exposure to either GSNO or diethylamine NONOate suggest that human GST P1-1 can also be nitrosylated inside the cell.

To this solution 45 μl of 11 m HCl was added and vortexed, and the solution was again placed on ice for a further 2 h. 40 μl of 10 m NaOH was then added to neutralize the solution. 4 ml of acetone were added, and the GSNO sank to the bottom of the tube as a pink oil. The upper layer of acetone/H2O was aspirated off. GSNO was re-suspended in 500 μl of H2O, and again 4 ml of acetone was added. The solution was mixed and then left to sit for an hour until the GSNO oil sank to the bottom. The upper solution was again aspirated away. The resulting pink oil was frozen to -196 °C and placed on a freeze dryer for 4 h. The resulting pink solid (yield of ∼0.89 mmol) had a UV spectrum consistent with published reports (27Hart T.W.

The compound was wrapped in aluminum foil to exclude light and stored at 4 °C. The GSNO concentration was determined by UV-visible spectroscopy as described (9Lo Bello M. Nuccetelli M. Caccuri A.M.

To 50 μl of 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, and 200 μl of 100 mm GSH, 20 μl of 100 mm GSNO was added. Finally, 2 μl of 1 m FeSO4 solution containing 0.5 mm vitamin C was added. The final concentrations were 40 mm GSH, 4 mm GSNO, 4 mm FeSO4, and 1 μm vitamin C in a 500-μl volume. After several hours on ice wrapped in aluminum foil to exclude light, the solution turned a strong yellow color that was stable, contrary to previous reports, for up to a week (9Lo Bello M.

DNDGIC cannot be isolated as a solid due to dimerization (30McDonald C.C. Phillips W. Mower H.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 87: 3319-3326Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar) but is stabilized in solution by the large excess of GSH present. Crystallization—Wild-type human Pi class GST P1-1 was expressed and purified as previously described (25Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P. Petruzzelli R. Muramatzu M. Ricci G. Federici G. Lo Bello M. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The protein was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method as described elsewhere (26Oakley A.J. Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Ricci G. Rossjohn J. Villar H.O. Parker M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 2-μl drop of protein (concentration of 6.7 mg/ml in 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) was mixed with the same volume of reservoir buffer composed of 100 mm MES buffer, pH 5.5 or 6.0, 22% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 20 mm CaCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm GSH. Crystals grew at 22 °C and reached a suitable size in approximately a week. Dinitrosyl Diglutathionyl Iron Complex Soak—Wild-type crystals were transferred into a new drop containing 200 μl of the DNDGIC solution described above, 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, 22% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 20 mm CaCl2. These crystals were soaked for several days. Data Collection and Processing—The x-ray diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source (Chicago, Illinois), beam line 14-ID-B using a MAR165 CCD MARResearch detector. The wavelength was set to 0.99 Å. For cryoprotection the crystals were soaked for 2 min in the well solution containing 5% (v/v) methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), then dipped briefly in well solution containing 10% (v/v) MPD. The crystals were then snap-frozen at 100 K in the cryostream. Diffraction data were processed and scaled with HKL (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The crystals were shown to belong to a monoclinic lattice, with the space group C2, as seen previously for the wild-type GST P1-1 (26Oakley A.J. Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Ricci G. Rossjohn J. Villar H.O. Parker M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—Refinement began with the Pi class GST in the C2 space group (5GSS (26Oakley A.J. Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Ricci G. Rossjohn J. Villar H.O. Parker M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)) that had GSH and water molecules removed. Rigid body refinement in CNS (32Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren J.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) was used to compensate for any possible changes in crystal packing. The starting model gave an R-factor of 33.0% (Rfree = 35.3%). The model was then refined by a round of simulated annealing using CNS. Because the asymmetric unit of the crystal contained two GST monomers, use was made of the non-crystallographic symmetry restraints on all non-hydrogen atoms in the initial rounds of the refinement. The model was rebuilt with TURBO (33Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 72-78Google Scholar), and GSH, MES, and water molecules were added. The model was further refined with cycles of positional and isotropically restrained B-factor refinement. After several rounds of refinement, the density for the iron complex was evident in a Fo - Fc map and was subsequently built into the model. An absorption scan at the iron edge, at 7.13 keV or 1.74 Å, demonstrated the presence of the metal in the crystal. However, data collected from this crystal were limited to a resolution of 2.7 Å because of radiation damage at this wavelength. Thus, the data were recollected at 0.99 Å off a fresh crystal. After multiple rounds of refinement and rebuilding the final R-factor was 18.2% (Rfree = 24.4%) for all data to 2.1 Å of resolution. The stereochemistry was analyzed with the program PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and gave values either similar or better than expected for structures refined at similar resolutions.

Mazzetti A.P. Petruzzelli R. Muramatzu M. Ricci G. Federici G. Lo Bello M. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of Tyr-7 into Phe, His, and Cys residues was accomplished using the same strategy adopted for the plasmid pGST-1 except that the synthetic linkers with NcoI-TaqI-compatible ends were obtained by annealing the following complementary oligonucleotides: 5′-CATGCCACCGTACACCGTTGTTTTCTTCCCGGTT and 5′-CGAACCGGGAAGAAAACAACGGTGTACGGTGG (Phe-7); 5′-CATGCCACCGTACACCGTTGTTCATTTCCCGGTT and 5′-CGAACCGGGAAATGAACAACGGTGTACGGTGG (His-7); 5′-CATGCCACCGTACACCGTTGTTTGCTTCCCGGTT and 5′-CGAACCGGGAAGCAAACAACGGTGTACGGTGG (Cys-7). Protein Expression and Purification—Native and mutant GST P1-1 enzymes were produced as described previously (25Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P. Petruzzelli R. Muramatzu M. Ricci G. Federici G. Lo Bello M. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P. Board P.G. Muramatsu M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol.

Briefly, E. coli strain TOP 10 cells, harboring plasmid pGST-1 or plasmids expressing Phe-7, His-7, or Cys-7 mutant enzymes (pGST-F7, pGST-H7, pGST-C7), were grown in Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The expression of GST was induced by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside when the absorbance at 600 nm was 0.5. Eighteen hours after induction cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed as previously described (25Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P. Petruzzelli R. Muramatzu M. Ricci G. Federici G. Lo Bello M. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Native and GST mutant enzymes were purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized glutathione (36Simons P.C. Vander Jagt D.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 82: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). After affinity purification, the native and the mutant enzymes (Y7F, Y7H, and Y7C) were homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic Studies—The enzymatic activities were determined spectrophotometrically at 25 °C with CDNB as cosubstrate following the product formation at 340 nm, ϵ = 9600 m-1 cm-1 (39Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric measurements were performed in a double beam Uvicon 940 spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments) equipped with a thermostatted cuvette compartment. Initial rates were measured at 0.1-s intervals for a total period of 12 s after a lag time of 5 s. Enzymatic rates were corrected for the spontaneous reaction. Apparent kinetic parameters, kcat, KmCDNB were determined in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and 0.1 mm EDTA, containing fixed concentrations of GSH (10 mm) and variable concentrations of CDNB (0.1-2 mm). The collected data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by non-linear regression analysis using the GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The apparent KmGSH was also determined at a fixed CDNB concentration (1 mm) and variable GSH concentrations (from 0.02-10 mm). Kinetic parameters reported in this paper represent the mean of at least three different experimental data sets. Cell Growth and NO Treatment of Intact Cells—Single colonies of freshly plated E. coli strain TOP 10 harboring plasmid pGST-1 or pGST-F7 were used to inoculate 25 ml of overnight cultures. These cultures were diluted 1:100 into Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, grown at 37 °C to an A600 value of 0.5, and induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Cells (1 liter) were grown at 37 °C for 4 h, divided in 4 aliquots (0.25 liter each), and treated as follows. (a) two aliquots were incubated with either 2 mm GSNO or 50 μm FeSO4, one aliquot was incubated with 2 mm GSNO and 50 μm FeSO4, and the last aliquot was used as the control. All the aliquots were incubated under the same conditions, at 37 °C for 15 min. (b) Another experimental set was established to monitor the time course of DNDGIC complex formation in which two aliquots were incubated with either 2 mm GSNO alone or 2 mm GSNO plus 50 μm FeSO4 at different times (5, 15, 30, 60 min). At the end of the incubation cells of different aliquots were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 7000 rpm, washed with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mm EDTA, and after centrifugation resuspended in a suitable volume of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis. The same cells were also lysed by sonication, and cell membranes were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was tested for GST activity assay, protein concentration, and further EPR analysis. A similar set of experiments was also carried out using 0.5 mm DEANO (final concentration) as the NO donor instead of GSNO. We used the concentration of 2 mm GSNO throughout this work, which is the same reported previously for the DNDGIC synthesis in vitro (9Lo Bello M. Nuccetelli M. Caccuri A.M. Stella L. Parker M.W.

However, we have also exposed E. coli cells to different concentrations of GSNO (in a range between 0.5 and 10 mm) and obtained quite similar results to those shown in Figs. 3 and 4. As an example, after 15 min of exposure to 0.5 mm GSNO or DEANO, the GST inactivation was about 20% (despite 35% with 2 mm GSNO), whereas the EPR signal was only slightly decreased in comparison with that shown in Fig. 3Ba (2 mm GSNO exposure). E. coli cell exposure to 10 mm GSNO (a sledge hammer) only reduces GST activity 40%. To check if 2 mm GSNO concentration could inhibit cell growth, we followed bacterial growth of cells exposed to 2 mm GSNO for 24 h at 600 nm, and we found no significant difference with E. coli untreated cells under the same conditions (data not shown).FIGURE 4GST specific activity in E. coli cells upon exposure to NO and/or iron before (black) and after cysteine (white) and cyanide (gray) treatment.

Nevertheless, the DNase- and potassium permanganate-hypersensitive sites are maintained on potentially active promoters during mitosis, helping to mark active genes at this stage of the cell cycle. Our study focuses on the role of histone acetylation and H3 (Lys-4) methylation in the maintenance of the competency of these active genes during mitosis. To this end we have analyzed histone modifications across the promoters and coding regions of constitutively active, inducible, and inactive genes in mitotic arrested cells. Our results show that basal histone modifications are maintained during mitosis at promoters and coding regions of the active and inducible RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes. In addition we have demonstrated that, together with H3 acetylation and H3 (Lys-4) methylation, H4 (Lys-12) acetylation at the coding regions contributes to the formation of a stable mark on active genes at this stage of the cell cycle. Finally, analysis of cyclin B1 gene activation during mitosis revealed that the former occurs with a strong increase of H3 (Lys-4) trimethylation but not H3 or H4 acetylation, suggesting that histone methyltransferases are active during this stage.

The packaging of the eukaryotic genome into chromatin has a profound effect on gene function. To counterbalance the repressive nature of chromatin, cells utilize two types of protein complexes that covalently modify the nucleosome core histones or catalyze nucleosome mobility in an ATP-dependent fashion (1Konberg R.D. Lorch Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 2Martens J.A. Winston F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Covalent modifications of histone proteins, such as acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination of the N-terminal tails of histones, have been hypothesized to constitute a histone code that controls the pattern of gene expression (3Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6623) Google Scholar, 4Turner B.M. Cell. 2002; 111: 285-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). In particular, histone acetylation correlates with gene activation by counteracting the repressive nucleosomal environment (5Th'ng J.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Acetylation occurs on conserved lysine residues of the N-terminal tails of the core histones and induces chromatin opening by perturbing higher order chromatin folding. More recently, H3 Lys-4 methylation has also been also described as an active gene-specific modification mark, helping to recruit the preinitiation complex on promoters during transcriptional activation (6Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sheriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar, 7Fischle W. Wang Y.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as in mammalian cells. In recent years it has become apparent that some histone modifications are involved in preserving the expression patterns through the cell division, contributing to the establishment of cellular memory. Histone methylation is believed to play an important role in maintaining the silenced heterochromatin (4Turner B.M. Cell. 2002; 111: 285-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 9Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). More recently it has been shown in mammalian cells that di- and trimethylated H3 Lys-4 peaks correspond to the 5′-coding region, suggesting the implication of these modifications in the establishment and/or in the maintenance of potentially active states (8Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Myers F.A. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Kouzarides T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). In contrast to histone methylation, histone acetylation is not believed to play an important role in cellular memory, since it is a dynamic modification. However, the finding that bromodomains can bind preferentially to acetylated lysines (10Zheng L. Zhou M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) leaves open the possibility that histone acetylation could serve as an active mark during mitosis (4Turner B.M. Cell. 2002; 111: 285-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) as has already been proposed (11Jeppesen P. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 12Kouskouti A. Talianidis I. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the potential role of histone acetylation in maintaining the active configuration during the mitotic stage of the cell cycle is not completely understood. Within this context we have analyzed the contribution of acetylation and H3 Lys-4 methylation to marking and activating genes during mitosis.

After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, cover slips were incubated with a 1:200 anti-acetyl-H3 (Lys-9 and -14) antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), 1:200 anti-polyacetyl-H4 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), 1:100 anti-phospho-H3 (Ser-10) (Upstate Biotechnology), 1:200 anti-dimethyl-H3 (Lys-4) antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), 1:200 anti-trimethyl H3 (Lys-4) antibody (Abcam), and 1:100 anti-acetyl-H4 (Lys-12) antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) in PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin for 2 h followed by incubation for 1 h with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, used at a 1:250 dilution in PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin. After each antibody incubation, coverslips were extensively washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 four times for 10 min each at room temperature. The nuclei were stained with DAPI. Cell Extract Preparation; Histone Extraction—Total cell extracts were prepared in IPH buffer (50 mm Tris-HCI, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, Nonidet P-40) (13Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar) by keeping the cells on ice for 20 min or the indicated times followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. All buffers contained protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Histones were extracted by O/N treatment of the whole cells with 0.25 m HCl at 4 °C under rotation. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, histones were precipitated by cold acetone and resuspended in SDS protein loading buffer. All buffers contained protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), trichostatin A (300 nm), and 25 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphatase, and 5 μm microcystin (14Dulic V.

Immunoblotting was performed using standard procedures and visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). HAT, HDAC, and HMT Assays—In vitro HAT, HDAC, and HMT assays were performed as previously described (6Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sheriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L.

Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis—HeLa cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration 125 mm. Cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS, once with buffer I (0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 6.5) and with buffer II (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 6.5) at 4 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mg/ml protease inhibitors, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated on ice until cross-linked chromatin was sheared to an average DNA fragment length of 0.2–0.5 kbp. After centrifugation (10–45 min 14,000 rpm), soluble cross-linked chromatin was diluted 1:10 in immunoprecipitation buffer (1%Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and protease inhibitors), divided into aliquots, and stored at –80 °C. Chromatin preparations were precleared by incubation with a protein A-Sepharose solution (30 mg of preimmune serum (35 mg/ml), 2 mg of herring sperm DNA (1 mg/ml), 50 ml of protein A-Sepharose CL4B (Amersham Biosciences) 10% in Tris-EDTA buffer (50 mg/500 ml of Tris-EDTA) in immunoprecipitation buffer for 2 h at 4°C under rotation. The protein A-Sepharose was removed by centrifugation; the pre-cleared chromatin was immunoprecipitated by incubation with the antibody O/N at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed with buffers TSE I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2Mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl), TSE II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl), and buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) and three times with Tris-EDTA buffer. Washed pellets were eluted with 300 μl of a solution containing 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. Eluted pellets were de-cross-linked with O/N at 65 °C and purified on 50 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer in a DNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). DNA was analyzed by PCR with primer pairs to promoter and coding regions of different genes. Antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal antibody against acetyl-H3 (Lys-9, Lys-14), polyacetyl-H4 (Lys-5, Lys-8, Lys-12, Lys-16), phospho-H3 (Ser-10), dimethylated H3 (Lys-4), acetyl-H4 (Lys-12) (Upstate Biotechnology), and trimethylated H3 (Lys-4) (Abcam). PCR Analysis—PCR analysis was performed as described by Breiling et al. (17Breiling A. Turner B.M. Bianchi M.E. Orlando V. Nature. 2001; 412: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). PCR products measured 220–330 bp in length and were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and revealed by staining with ethidium bromide. Decreasing amounts of input DNA (10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01%) were used to determine the linear range of the PCR reactions for each primer pair and immunoprecipitation. The following primer pairs were used. Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) gene designed at the proximal promoter region and the coding region were, respectively, 5′-CCC TTC CCA CCG CCA CTC CC-3′, 5′-GCA GCT CCT CAG GCT AGC CG-3′ and 5′-CCC TCT CGC CCT CGT ACA CC-3′ and 5′-GAG CAT CAA CCC CGA CGA GG-3′. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene at the promoter region and the coding region were, respectively, GCT CCA ATT CCC CAT CTC AG (forward), CCA GGC TCA GCC AGT CCC AG (reverse) and GGC TGT GGG CAA GGT CAT CC (forward), GGT GGA GGA GTG GGT GTC GC (reverse). Primers for the cyclin B1 gene for the promoter and coding regions were, respectively, CCT TTC CAG GTG GGC GGC GC (forward), GCT GCC GGT CGC AGA GAA TG (reverse) and CTG CCT CTC CAA GCC CAA TGG (forward), GCT GCC CAC GTC CTG CTT G (reverse). And, finally, for the interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter and coding regions were, respectively, GTT CAG TGT AGT TTT AGG AC (forward), CT CTT CTG ATG ACT CTT TG (reverse) and CCC TAT CAC TCT TTA ATC AC (forward), GCA GTA AAT GCT CCA GTT GT (reverse). ChIP Quantification—To quantify ChIP signals, PCR gel bands were measured using QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad), then values from immunoprecipitated samples were divided by the corresponding 1% input sample (the PCR signals of this input sample were not saturated). Bound/input values were then averaged from multiple (at least three) PCR reactions from independent experiments. All data in the figures correspond to percentages from the 1% input sample. Global Acetylation and H3 (Lys-4) Methylation at Interphase and Mitosis—We first analyzed the levels of histone modification, which define active genes (H3 and H4 acetylation and H3 (Lys-4) di- and trimethylation) in global chromatin at interphase and mitosis. To this end HeLa S3 cells were synchronized in mitosis by treatment with nocodazole, which inhibits microtubule polymerization in a reverse manner. The mitotic index of the cell population after nocodazole treatment was determined by 1) fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and measured 90–95% (Fig. 1A) and 2) by microscopic examination of condensed chromosomes and nuclear envelope breakdown (data not shown). We then analyzed the acetylation of H3 (at Lys-9 and Lys-14 positions) and H4 polyacetylation (at Lys-5, -8, -12, and -16 positions) by immunoblotting and indirect immunostaining. Figs. 1, B and C, show that the level of H3 acetylation was maintained during mitosis (Fig. 1, B (2) and C (3 and 4)) H4 polyacetylation but decreased after the cells entered mitosis (Figs. 1, B (1) and C (1 and 2)), as was previously shown (18Kruhlak M.J. Hendzel M.J. Fischle W. Bertos N.R. Hameed S. Yang X.J. Verdin E. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38307-38319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and recovered by the end of the telophase (Ref. 18Kruhlak M.J. Hendzel M.J. Fischle W. Bertos N.R. Hameed S. Yang X.J. Verdin E. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38307-38319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar and data not shown). We subsequently analyzed the H3 (Lys-4) di- and trimethylation levels of global chromatin at the interphase and during mitosis. Fig. 1, B (3 and 4) and C (5–8) show that in contrast to the global decrease of H4 polyacetylation, H3 (Lys-4) di- and trimethylation levels remained unchanged from the interphase to mitosis. Afterward, we analyzed the temporal relationship between the levels of di- and trimethylated histone H3 at Lys-4 and chromatin condensation. To this end we examined histone H3 (Lys-4) methylation states through mitosis. As shown in Fig. 1D, high levels of H3 methylation were observed on the chromosomes from the prophase to the telophase. This pattern differed from that of histone hyperacetylation; in this case, a concomitant decrease occurred as chromatin condensed into metaphase chromosomes and was re-established during late telophase (Ref. 18Kruhlak M.J. Hendzel M.J. Fischle W. Bertos N.R. Hameed S. Yang X.J. Verdin E. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38307-38319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar and data not shown). These data suggest that histone methylation plays a different role than that of histone acetylation during mitosis. As expected, H3 (Ser-10) phosphorylation clearly peaked when the cells entered mitosis, remaining until late telophase (Fig. 1, B (5) and C (9 and 10)). Unequal Subcellular Distribution of HAT and HDAC Activities during Mitosis—Mitotic global histone deacetylation has been postulated to occur by the displacement of HAT and HDAC enzymes from condensing chromosomes as cells undergo mitosis (18Kruhlak M.J. Hendzel M.J. Fischle W. Bertos N.R. Hameed S. Yang X.J. Verdin E. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38307-38319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, if both activities were displaced from chromatin, the final histone acetylation/deacetylation equilibrium would be maintained. To get better insight into this problem, we have analyzed the subcellular distribution of HAT and HDAC activities in asynchronous and mitotic cells. To this end we extracted them with IPH buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated them in ice for different time periods to release loosely bound proteins (soluble fraction). The resulting pellet contained the tightly bound proteins, which included those strongly associated with fragments of the nuclear matrix (pellet). The distribution of HAT and HDAC activities in asynchronous and mitotic cells in soluble and pellet fractions was determined by in vitro HAT and HDAC assays, respectively. The level of HAT activity in the lysates changed from asynchrony to mitosis; indeed, during the latter, most of the HAT activity was present in the tightly bound fraction (Fig. 1E). However, this situation was completely different for HDAC activity, which was found mainly in the soluble fraction during mitosis (Fig. 1E). These findings suggest an unequal availability of HAT and HDAC enzymes, potentially explaining the global alteration in acetylation/deacetylation equilibrium, thereby leading to a global histone deacetylation during mitosis These data are consistent with previous results demonstrating a general loss of histone acetylation when cells undergo mitosis. This led us to analyze whether the promoter regions from active genes also lose acetylation marks during mitosis, and prompted us to investigate the significance underlying the maintenance of general H3 methylation in mitosis. Histone Acetylation and H3 (Lys-4) Methylation at Active and Inducible Promoters in Mitosis—To investigate the possible role of histone active modifications in the mitotic marking of active or inducible genes in living cells, we performed comparative ChIP analyses. Formaldehyde-cross-linked soluble chromatin was prepared from asynchronous and mitotic HeLa cells, normalized for DNA content, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against acetylated H3 (Lys-9 and -14), polyacetylated H4 (Lys-5, -8, -12, and -16), di- and trimethylated H3 (Lys-4), and phosphorylated H3 (Ser-10) (TABLE ONE). Acetylation and methylation levels were determined by quantitative PCR analysis at the promoter regions of a constitutively active gene transcribed by RNA polymerase II GAPDH and an inactive RNA polymerase II-transcribed gene (IL-2).TABLE ONECharacterization of antibodies recognizing modified histones H3 and H4AntibodyAntibody recognizes modificationsSource or referenceInterphaseMitosisAnti-acetyl-H3Lysines 9- and 14-acetylated H3Upstate Biotechnology 06-:599++Anti-acetyl-H4Lysines 5-, 8-, 12-, 16-acetylated H4Upstate Biotechnology 06-:866++/-Anti-phospho-H3Serine 10-phosphorylated H3Upstate Biotechnology 06-:570-+Anti-dimethyl-H3 Lys-4Lysine 4-dimethylated H3Upstate Biotechnology 07-:030++Anti-trimethyl-H3 Lys-4Lysine 4-trimethylated H3Abcam ab8580++ Open table in a new tab We first compared the ChIP signals from asynchronous and mitotic cell populations. We found that the H3-acetylated basal signal at the GAPDH promoter was maintained during mitosis (Fig. 2A). The H4 acetylated basal signal slightly decreased relative to the asynchronous cells (Fig. 2A) but remained significantly higher than background levels obtained from the inactive gene promoter, IL-2 (Fig. 2B), during mitosis. H3 (Lys-4) methylation was subsequently analyzed at the GAPDH promoter in mitotic cells, finding that di- and trimethylated H3 (Lys-4) ChIP signals were similar to those from asynchronous cells (Fig. 2A). No methylated H3 (Lys-4) ChIP signals were found at the transcriptionally inactive promoter IL-2 (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that basal H3 and H4 acetylation as well as H3 (Lys-4) methylation marks are specifically maintained at the GAPDH promoter during mitosis (although a partial loss of H4 acetylation occurs). After observing that activation marks are maintained during mitosis in the constitutively active RNA polymerase II-transcribed gene, we sought to analyze the promoter of an inducible gene, Hsp70. Fig. 2C shows that H3- and H4-acetylated ChIP signals in the Hsp70 promoter increased after heat shock (HS) stimulation of asynchronous cells as well as H3 (Ser-10) phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). H3 (Lys-4) methylation, however, did not significantly change after HS (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that both histone acetylation and H3 phosphorylation are involved in the rapid activation of the Hsp70 gene in asynchronous cells. In Drosophila, immunostaining studies have revealed that only H3 phosphorylation is involved in Hsp70 activation (19Nowak S.J. Corces V.G. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 214-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). However, mouse Hsp70 promoter has been postulated to require only histone acetylation to be activated after HS (20Thomson S. Hollis A. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our ChIP results suggest that both modifications occur after HS activation in human cells. Next, we compared the ChIP signals from asynchronous and mitotic cell populations. We found that the H3 acetylated basal signal was maintained during mitosis (Fig. 2D). The H4-acetylated basal signal decreased by 35–40%, relative to the asynchronous cells (Fig. 2D), but remained significantly higher than the background levels obtained from the inactive gene promoter (IL-2) during mitosis (Fig. 2B). After HS, the mitotic basal levels of acetylated H3 and H4 did not change (data not shown). Finally, H3 (Lys-4) methylation was analyzed at the Hsp70 promoter in mitotic cells, finding that di- and trimethylated H3 (Lys-4) ChIP signals were similar to those from asynchronous cells (Fig. 2D). These data confirm the above results; H3 and H4 acetylation marks are maintained during mitosis at the promoter regions of inducible and active genes. In the same manner, H3 (Lys-4) di- and trimethylation levels did not change during mitosis. As described above, the analysis of the H3, H4 acetylation, and H3 (Lys-4) methylation levels of the inactive RNA polymerase II-transcribed promoter IL-2 revealed no modifications either at synchrony or at mitosis; only H3 Ser-10 phosphorylation was detected after the cells underwent mitosis (Fig. 2B). Histone Acetylation and H3 (Lys-4) Methylation at Active and Inducible Genes during Mitosis—It is possible that the maintenance of acetylation and methylation at active promoters serves to signal the reassembly of transcriptional machinery at the G1 or S phase; in such a case the promoter histone posttranslational modifications could play a pivotal role in marking active genes. We, therefore, analyzed whether the coding regions are also marked during mitosis by acetylation and methylation. H3 acetylation ChIP signals of the GAPDH-coding region from mitotic cells were reduced by 15–20% compared with those from asynchronous cells during mitosis (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, H4 acetylation ChIP signals decreased by 40–50% in mitotic cells relative to asynchronous cells (Fig. 3A). We also analyzed the Hsp70-coding region using ChIPs. We initially observed that H3 and H4 acetylation as well as H3 phosphorylation occur both in the analyzed Hsp70-coding region (Fig. 3C) and in the promoter (Fig. 2C) after HS activation. We subsequently compared the ChIP signals from asynchronous and mitotic cell populations. We found that histone acetylation and H3 (Lys-4) trimethylation basal mitotic signals slightly decreased at the Hsp70-coding region relative to asynchronous cells (Fig. 3D). On the other hand, H3 (Lys-4) dimethylation levels did not change during mitosis (Fig. 3, A and D). As expected, neither histone acetylation nor methylation was detected at the IL-2-coding region (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that coding regions as well as promoters of active and potentially active RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes maintain the basal acetylation and H3 (Lys-4) methylation levels during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. These histone posttranslational modifications may play a critical role in marking active gene during mitosis. H4 Lys-12 Acetylation at Interphase and Mitosis—To identify potentially important sites for cellular memory within chromatin, Gottschling and co-workers (21Smith C.M. Haimberger Z.W. Johnson C.O. Wolf A.J. Gafken P.R. Zhang Z. Parthun M.R. Gottschling D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16454-16461Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) conducted a genetic screen in S. cerevisiae to isolate those mutant alleles of the H3 and H4 genes that set telomeric genes into a silenced state. They found that the level of acetylation at lysine 12 within the histone H4 tail functioned as a memory mark for propagating the expression state of a telomeric gene during mitosis. Based on this finding, we determined whether or not H4 (Lys-12) acetylation could affect the maintenance of transcriptional competency of euchromatic genes in mammalian cells. We studied the levels of acetylated H4 (Lys-12) on global chromatin at interphase and mitosis by immunoblotting and indirect immunostaining. Fig. 4, panels A and B, shows that the levels of acetylated H4 (Lys-12) are maintained during mitosis in bulk chromatin. We then analyzed acetyl-H4 (Lys-12) levels at the promoter and coding regions of the above-analyzed genes using ChIP assays; we have included the cyclin B1 gene since it is actively transcribed during mitosis (22Sciortino S. Gurtner A. Manni I. Fontemaggi G. Dey A. Sacchi A. Ozato K. Piaggio G. EMBO Rep. 2001; 11: 1018-1023Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that H4 (Lys-12) acetylation is present at the coding regions of active and potentially active genes either in asynchronous or in mitotic cells (Fig. 4C). However, very weak or no ChIP signal was detected at the promoter regions of these active genes (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the promoter and coding region of the IL-2 gene were not reactive to anti-acetyl-H4 (Lys-12) antibody either in asynchronous or in mitotic cells (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that in histone H4, lysine 12 may serve as a memory mark in the nucleosome for the inheritable transmission of the active or inactive state in euchromatic genes, as has been suggested for telomeric genes (21Smith C.M. Haimberger Z.W. Johnson C.O. Wolf A.J. Gafken P.R. Zhang Z. Parthun M.R. Gottschling D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16454-16461Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Histone H3 (Lys-4) Methylation Couples with Transcription during Mitosis—It has been suggested that histone acetylation cannot occur during mitosis due to the displacement of HAT enzymes away from mitotic chromatin during the early prophase (18Kruhlak M.J. Hendzel M.J. Fischle W. Bertos N.R. Hameed S. Yang X.J. Verdin E. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38307-38319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We, therefore, decided to analyze whether the activation of mitotic-transcribed genes involves ongoing histone acetylation and/or methylation. To this end we analyzed the levels of acetylation at the cyclin B1 promoter during mitosis (when it was actively transcribed) using ChIP assays. The results in Fig. 5A reveal no changes in the H3 and H4 acetylation levels after gene activation during mitosis. However, the di- and trimethylated H3 (Lys-4) and phosphorylated H3 (Ser-10) signals clearly increased after gene activation (Fig. 5A). This suggests the existence of an ongoing HMT activity coupled with cyclin B1 transcription during mitosis. H3 (Ser-10) phosphorylation may be a necessary signal for mitotic entry, or it may be involved in cyclin B1 transcription activation, as has been suggested for other genes (19Nowak S.J. Corces V.G. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 214-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Once we determined that active histone methylation at the promoter region may be involved in gene activation during mitosis, we analyzed whether it also occurs at the coding region of the cyclin B1 gene. Activation of this gene strongly correlates with an increase of trimethylated H3 (Lys-4) (Fig. 5B) but not of acetylated H3 and H4. In fact, the basal levels of acetylated H4 present in interphase decreased by 30–40% during mitosis (Fig. 5B), whereas acetylated H3 was not detectable in the analyzed region (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that HMTs are maintained as active enzymes during mitosis capable to methylate some mitotically active genes. Based on this premise we analyzed the HMT activity in asynchronous and mitotic cells. As shown in TABLE TWO, the global HMT activity associated with mitotic and asynchronous cells was similar, suggesting the possibility that HMTs are maintained as active enzymes during mitosis.TABLE TWOIn vitro ratio of interphase/mitosis histone methyltransferase activityTotal cell extractRatio of interphase to mitosis mean HMT activity (n = 3)μg100.94200.90401.07 Open table in a new tab Our current study demonstrates that although bulk chromatin is generally deacetylated during mitosis, acetylation and methylation marks of some active genes persist in the parental nucleosomes during mitosis. The general removal of acetyl groups from the modified lysines residues of core histones (23Jeppesen P. Mitchell A. Turner B. Perry P. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1992; 101: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24Turner B.M. Fellows G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) may be necessary for the compaction of chromatin, which involves neutralization of DNA negative charges (25Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16284-16289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that in the absence of histone H1, the acetylated nucleosome complexes remain in an extended conformation in contrast to the nonacetylated nucleosomes (26García-Ramirez M. Rocchini C. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17923-17928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 27Tse C. Sera T. Wolffe A.P. Hansen J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as a consequence of the linker histone binding required to allow high levels of chromatin compaction, inhibition of acetylation of oligonucleosomes occurs (28Herrera J.E. West K.L. Schiltz R.L. Nakatani Y. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the maintenance of some acetylated loci may be important in preventing some active genes from becoming silenced, as has been proposed (11Jeppesen P. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 12Kouskouti A. Talianidis I. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Acetylation would serve as a signal for the propagation and maintenance of active chromatin states through cell division. How would histone modifications serve as an epigenetic mark during mitosis? According to the histone code hypothesis, different modifications are recognized by specific associated proteins responsible for reading the code (4Turner B.M. Cell. 2002; 111: 285-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 29Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7666) Google Scholar). Thus, permanent acetylation and methylation of promoter in active genes would serve to specifically bind certain effector proteins. Candidates for such interactions include (i) the Brd4 protein that contains two bromodomains and remains bound to mitotic chromatin in a bromo-dependent manner (30Dey A. Chistsaz F. Abbasi A. Mistelli T. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8758-8763Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 31Kanno T. Kanno Y. Siegel R.M. Jang M.K. Lenardo M.J. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and (ii) TFIID complex, which specifically interacts with acetylated histone H3 at lysines 9 and 14 (32Christova R. Oelgeschlager T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). H3 (Lys-4) methylation could also provide a specific high affinity interaction surface for SNF2H binding (33Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bernstein B.E. Karabetsou N. Morillon A. Weise C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1325-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) or for some chromo-domain-containing complexes (34de la Cruz X. Llois S. Sánchez-Molina S. Martínez-Balbás M.A. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Interestingly, immunostaining analysis of the global H3 and H4 acetylation and H3 (Lys-4) methylation levels in mitotic cells revealed that residual mitotic acetylation and methylation correspond to discreet regions of the genomic chromatin, suggesting that previously active genes or genes that need to be rapidly reactivated after mitosis co-exist in the same chromatin domains. Our results are consistent with Kouskouti and Talianidis (12Kouskouti A. Talianidis I. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) data for the human constitutively active hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 and 4 and albumin genes for H3 and H4 acetylation and H3 (Lys-4) methylation. Moreover, the present study expands the data for inactive but inducible (human Hsp70), inactive (IL-2), and mitotically active (cyclin B1) genes. In addition we have shown that H4 (Lys-12) acetylation at the coding regions in tandem with H3 acetylation and H3 (Lys-4) methylation contributes to the formation of a stable mark on active genes during mitosis. Finally, our results show that activation of cyclin B1 gene strongly correlates with an increase of trimethylated H3 (Lys-4) but not H3 and H4 acetylation. Thus, these data provide the first evidence that HMTs may be maintained as active enzymes during this stage of the cell cycle. Therefore, the regulation of HMT enzymes during mitosis may differ from that of HAT/HDAC enzymes (18Kruhlak M.J. Hendzel M.J. Fischle W. Bertos N.R. Hameed S. Yang X.J. Verdin E. Bazett-Jones D.P. J.

The ubiquitous β-arrestins are believed to function exclusively as monomers, although self-association is assumed to control the activity of visual arrestin in the retina, where this isoform is particularly abundant. Here the oligomerization status of β-arrestins was investigated using different approaches, including co-immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged β-arrestins and resonance energy transfer (BRET and FRET) in living cells. At steady state and at physiological concentrations, β-arrestins constitutively form both homo- and hetero-oligomers. Co-expression of β-arrestin2 and β-arrestin1 prevented β-arrestin1 accumulation into the nucleus, suggesting that hetero-oligomerization may have functional consequences. Our data clearly indicate that β-arrestins can exist as homo- and hetero-oligomers in living cells and raise the hypothesis that the oligomeric state may regulate their subcellular distribution and functions.

Arrestins play a central role in the regulation and signaling of serpentine heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 5The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorβarrβ-arrestinBRETbioluminescence resonance energy transferFRETfluorescescence resonance energy transferNESnuclear export signalYFPyellow fluorescent proteinTSCSPCtime- and space-correlated single photon countingFLIMfluorescence lifetime imaging microscopyGFPgreen fluorescent proteinCFPcyan fluorescent proteinJNKc-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Arrestin 1 and 4 are restricted to retinal rods and cones where they regulate rhodopsin (1Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In contrast, arrestin 2 and 3, also referred to as β-arrestin 1 (βarr1) and 2 (βarr2), respectively, are ubiquitous and translocate to a large variety of ligand-activated GPCRs. Originally identified as negative regulators of GPCR function, promoting desensitization (2Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), βarrs were subsequently shown to be adaptor proteins connecting GPCRs to the endocytic machinery (3Goodman O.B.J.

Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). For example, βarrs act as scaffolds for the activation of ERK and JNK3 (5Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). In addition, βarr2 redistributes the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 and the kinase JNK3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, a property related to the presence of a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) in βarr2 (6Scott M.G.

This signal is absent from βarr1, determining some differences in both subcellular distribution and functional roles between the two isoforms (6Scott M.G. Le Rouzic E. Perianin A. Pierotti V.

Crystal structures of visual arrestin (9Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H.W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 10Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) revealed that this molecule contains two globular domains and an extended COOH-terminal tail locking the molecule into an inactive state. Upon binding to receptors, the arrestin C-tail is released, leading to an open active conformation (11Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 105-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In crystals, visual arrestin is a tetramer composed of two asymmetric dimers (9Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H.W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 10Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments showed that, in solution, tetramers are in equilibrium with monomers at physiological concentrations (12Shilton B.H. McDowell J.H. Smith W.C. Hargrave P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3801-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Schubert C. Hirsch J.A. Gurevich V.V. Engelman D.M. Sigler P.B. Fleming K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21186-21190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and it was proposed that self-association might regulate arrestin activity by limiting availability of active monomeric species (13Schubert C. Hirsch J.A. Gurevich V.V. Engelman D.M. Sigler P.B. Fleming K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21186-21190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of βarr1 is very similar to that of visual arrestin, but unlike visual arrestin, full-length βarr1 was found to be monomeric (14Milano S.K. Pace H.C. Kim Y.M. Brenner C. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In addition, because of their lower intracellular concentration, falling far below that leading to equilibrium between arrestin monomers and tetramers in solution, it was postulated that βarr1 and βarr2 only exist as monomers in cells (14Milano S.K. Pace H.C. Kim Y.M. Brenner C. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 15Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). However, βarr1 truncated of its COOH-terminal tail was found to form dimers in crystals (15Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility that βarrs oligomerize in vivo cannot be excluded based on the existing evidence. This hypothesis was investigated here using a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches in vitro and in living cells. Materials—If not otherwise specified, all chemicals and reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). Polyclonal anti-βarr2 antibodies were a generous gift from Prof. J. L. Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). Leptomycin B was a kind gift from Minoru Yoshida (University of Tokyo, Japan). The anti-Myc polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, monoclonal and polyclonal anti-FLAG antibodies were from Sigma. Alexa-594-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobin was from Molecular Probes (Molecular Probes Europe, Leiden, The Netherlands). Expression Vectors—The construction of pβarr2-FLAG, pβarr2-YFP, pβarr2-GFP, pβarr2-L395A-GFP, and pβarr2-R396A-GFP have been described previously (6Scott M.G. Le Rouzic E. Perianin A. Pierotti V. Enslen H. Benichou S. Marullo S. Benmerah A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37693-37701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The plasmid pβarr2-CFP was generated by subcloning the βarr2 coding region into ECFPN1 (Clontech Europe, Erembodegem, Belgium). βarr2 and βarr1 cDNAs were amplified by PCR and subcloned in pCMV-Tag3A (Stratagene) to create pMyc-βarr2 and pMyc-βarr1. To obtain Rluc-βarr1 and βarr2-Rluc, appropriate forms of βarr were subcloned in frame, in the phRluc-C1 or -N3 vector, respectively, encoding the humanized Renilla luciferase (BioSignal, Montreal, Canada). YFP-βarr1 and YFP-βarr2 were obtained by sucloning corresponding cDNAs in the pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech). All constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (all from Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France), at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells in the 35-mm diameter wells of 6-well plates. Transient transfections were performed the following day using FuGENE (Roche, Meylan, France), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and either used for BRET experiments or grown on coverslips for FRET or immunofluorescence experiments. About 50-70% cells were fluorescent at the time of the experiments. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—48 h post-transfection cells were lysed in 1 ml of cold glycerol lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA 1% Trition X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, supplemented with protease inhibitors) and clarified by centrifugation at 13, 000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed using 20 μl of a 50% slurry of monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG-affinity agarose, with constant agitation overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation, immune complexes were washed four times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis was performed using a polyclonal anti-Myc antibody. The chemiluminescence reaction was performed using the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). BRET Assay—COS cells were transfected with 10 ng/well of the DNA construct coding for BRET donor and increasing (10-250 ng/well) amounts of the construct coding for BRET acceptor (or control YFP). 24 h after transfection, cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Aliquots of 1 × 105 cells were distributed in 96-well microplates (White Optiplate, PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Packard Biosciences). The luciferase substrate, coelenterazine h (Molecular Probes Europe, Leiden, The Netherlands), was added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and emitted luminescence and fluorescence were measured simultaneously using the Mithras™ fluorescence-luminescence detector (Berthold, Germany). Cells expressing BRET donors alone were used to determine background. Filter sets were 485 ± 10 nm for luciferase emission and 530 ± 12.5 nm for YFP emission. BRET ratios were calculated as described (16Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy—Fluorescence decays were measured in cells expressing the FRET donor alone (βarr2 fused to CFP) or both FRET donor and acceptor (βarr2 fused to YFP). The microscopy system, based on time- and space-correlated single photon counting (TSCSPC), has been described elsewhere (17Emiliani V. Sanvitto D. Tramier M. Piolot T.Z.P. Kemnitz K. Durieux C. Coppey-Moisan M. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2003; 83: 2471-2473Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, a mode-locked titanium sapphire laser (Millennia 5W/Tsunami 3960-M3BB-UPG kit, Spectra-Physics, France) delivering picosecond pulses was tuned at 880 nm to obtain a 440 nm excitation wavelength after frequency doubling. The repetition rate was 4 MHz after pulse-picker (Spectra-physics 3980-35). The laser beam was expanded and directed into an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Leica DMIRBE, Leica, France) for wide field illumination. The fluorescence emitted by the sample was imaged with a 100× objective (NA = 1.3) directly at the entrance of the quadrant-anode TSCSPC detector (QA, Europhoton GmbH, Germany). Fluorescence decay imaging was established by counting for 10 min and sampling single emitted photons according to: (i) the time delay between their arrival and the laser pulse (picosecond time scale, 4096 channels), (ii) their xy coordinate (256 × 256 pixels image), and (iii) their absolute time. The count rate was up to 50 kHz. Appropriate band pass emission filter (460 nm < λem < 500 nm) was chosen to select the donor fluorescence and to reject the acceptor fluorescence. Fluorescence decays were determined from different regions of interest in cells expressing the fluorescence donor alone or both donor and acceptor. Decays were fitted with a Marquardt nonlinear least square algorithm (Globals Unlimited Software, University of Illinois at Urbana, Champaign, IL) by using two lifetimes as theoretical model. Images were obtained by analyzing pixel-by-pixel fluorescence decays with a mean lifetime. Immunofluorescence—COS-7 cells were seeded on coverslips in 6-well plates, transfected with appropriate plasmids and used for immunofluorescence 1 day later. Cells were fixed and processed for fluorescence microscopy as described previously (18Scott M.G. Benmerah A. Muntaner O. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3552-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Samples were examined under a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad 1024 MRC). Images were processed using Bio-Rad Lasersharp 2000 software and optimized for contrast using Adobe Photoshop. βarr2 and βarr1 Form Homo-oligomers—Yeast two-hybrid screens were conducted to identify new βarr1 and βarr2 interaction partners (data not shown). Both βarrs were present among the identified preys, consistent with the formation of homo-oligomers. Interestingly, the βarr1 bait also interacted with a βarr2 prey, indicating possible hetero-oligomerization between the different βarr isoforms. The two-hybrid findings were confirmed by biochemical assays. COS-7 cells, which were reported to express very low levels of endogenous β-arrs (19Menard L. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Lin F.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), were transfected with plasmids encoding differentially epitope-tagged βarr2 for co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1). Myc-tagged βarr2 co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged βarr2, supporting the hypothesis that constitutive βarr2 homo-oligomers exist in cells. Energy transfer-based approaches can detect protein-protein interactions occurring in living cells at physiological expression levels (20Eidne K.A. Kroeger K.M. Hanyaloglu A.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 415-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In particular, BRET between Renilla luciferase (Luc, the BRET-donor) and a yellow variant of the green fluorescence protein (YFP, the BRET acceptor) has been extensively used to monitor GPCR oligomerization (21Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 22Breitwieser G.E. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and βarr2 recruitment to activated receptors (16Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar, 23Charest P.G. Terrillon S. Bouvier M. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). BRET saturation experiments (24Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) were carried out in COS-7 cells to investigate basal βarr2 oligomerization. A constant amount of βarr2-Luc cDNA, encoding a fusion protein, in which Luc is linked to the carboxyl-terminal extremity of βarr2, was co-transfected with increasing amounts of cDNAs coding for βarr2 fused either downstream (YFP-βarr2) or upstream (βarr2-YFP) of YFP. YFP alone was used to determine “bystander” non-selective BRET (24Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Specific BRET signals were measured with acceptors in either orientation, indicating the presence of βarr2 oligomers. Maximal BRET values were higher in experiments carried out with YFP-βarr2, compared with βarr2-YFP, indicating that BRET signals reflect an oriented oligomerization of βarr2 and not its nonspecific aggregation. Indeed, in the case of non-specific aggregation, BRET signals would have likely been independent of donor and acceptor orientations. The position of the BRET acceptor, respective to βarr2, does not modify the propensity of βarr2 to form constitutive oligomers, since the ratio of acceptor/donor at which half-maximal BRET was obtained (BRET50) is similar for both orientations. Immunoblot experiments were carried out to quantify the amount of YFP-βarr2 and βarr2-Luc expressed in aliquots of COS-7 cells, in which specific BRET signals were obtained (Fig. 2B). The amount of material immunostained with anti-βarr2 antibodies was quantified by gel scanning and was found to be 1.9 times higher than the endogenous level detected in untransfected HEK293 cells. In several experiments of the BRET saturation curve, the total amount of exogenous βarr2, which was quantified based on luciferase and fluorescence signals, was 30-40% below the amount of tagged βarr2 quantified in the Western blot of Fig. 2B. In addition, several other cell lines have been reported to express higher (up to 2-fold) endogenous βarr2 (and βarr1) than HEK293 cells (25Santini F. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2463-2470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating that constitutive βarr2 oligomers may form in living cells expressing physiological concentrations of this protein. The BRET approach cannot identify the subcellular localization in which the interaction between the donor and the acceptor occurs. Such information can be obtained by using FRET imaging. Among the various available FRET-based approaches, picosecond fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (picosecond FLIM) was reported to be particularly well adapted to in vivo studies because it requires low excitation intensity (avoiding photobleaching) and low levels of fluorescent proteins to be detected (26Tramier M. Gautier I. Piolot T. Ravalet S. Kemnitz K. Coppey J. Durieux C. Mignotte V. Coppey-Moisan M. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3570-3577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 27Tramier M. Piolot T. Gautier I. Mignotte V. Coppey J. Kemnitz K. Durieux C. Coppey-Moisan M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 360: 580-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). FLIM is based on the principle that the decay of the donor fluorescence is accelerated when FRET occurs between the donor and an acceptor. Fluorescence lifetime (τ) of the FRET donor, the cyan variant of the GFP (CFP), was measured at steady state in COS-7 cells either expressing βarr2-CFP alone or coexpressing βarr2-CFP and βarr2 fused downstream to the FRET acceptor YFP (Fig. 3a). Because CFP fluorescence decay is bi-exponential, mean fluorescence lifetimes (τm) were calculated from each component. The curves presented in Fig. 3A represent fluorescence decays averaged for 10 min over the entire surface of single cells. The significant decrease of average τm (Δτm = 0.191 ns), caused by FRET in cells coexpressing βarr2-CFP and YFP-βarr2, compared with cells expressing βarr2-CFP alone, indicates the presence of βarr2 oligomers. No significant FRET was measured in cells expressing βarr2-CFP and free YFP (data not shown). As a positive control, a τm difference of 0.250 ns was measured between COS-7 cells expressing a CFP-YFP fusion protein (for which strong FRET is expected) and COS cells expressing CFP alone (data not shown). The average τm can be visualized pixel by pixel on a color code scale. As shown in Fig. 3b βarr2 oligomers appeared evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells. In agreement with the reported nuclear exclusion of βarr2 at steady state (6Scott M.G. Le Rouzic E. Perianin A. Pierotti V. Enslen H. Benichou S. Marullo S. Benmerah A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37693-37701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), no βarr2 was visible in the nucleus. Co-immunoprecipitation and BRET experiments were also conducted with βarr1 constructs (Fig. 4). Myc-βarr1 co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-βarr1 and specific BRET signals were obtained using Luc-βarr1 and YFP-βarr1 as donor and acceptor, respectively. Maximal BRET signals and BRET50 value were comparable with those measured for BRET studies on βarr2 indicating that the two βarr isoforms have a similar propensity for self-association. βarrs Can Form Hetero-oligomers—As the two-hybrid results indicated that βarr1 and βarr2 hetero-dimers have the capacity to form in yeast, we investigated whether hetero-oligomerization between the two different βarr isoforms occurs in living mammalian cells. A first confirmation of this hypothesis came from experiments with epitope-tagged βarrs showing that, indeed, Myc-βarr1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with βarr2-FLAG (Fig. 5A). BRET studies were also conducted in cells expressing a donor and an acceptor of each βarr species (Fig. 5B). Again, specific BRET signals, comparable in amplitude and BRET50 to those obtained in the experiments above, were measured whatever the βarr species used as BRET donor or acceptor. Together, these results indicate that βarrs have the propensity to self-associate into either homo or hetero-oligomers in living cells. Subcellular Distribution of βarr Homo- and Hetero-oligomers—To determine whether βarr oligomerization may be correlated with biological effects, we took advantage of a recent report showing that βarr2 permanently shuttles between the cytosol and the nucleus in resting cells and that inhibition of the nuclear export machinery leads to the nuclear accumulation of βarr2 (6Scott M.G. Le Rouzic E. Perianin A. Pierotti V. Enslen H. Benichou S. Marullo S. Benmerah A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37693-37701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 7Wang P. Wu Y. Ge X. Ma L. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11648-11653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Accordingly, disruption of the βarr2 NES by a single amino acid residue substitution (βarr2-L395A) caused nuclear accumulation of the resulting mutant (Fig. 6A, upper right panel). Upon co-expression with βarr2-L395A, a significant proportion of wild type βarr2, which is normally undetectable in the nucleus (Fig. 6A, upper left panel), was sequestered into this compartment where it co-localized with βarr2-L395A (Fig. 6A, lower panels). The dominant effect of βarr2-L395A on wild type βarr2 subcellular localization supports the occurrence of hetero-oligomerization between these two species and the nuclear localization of these oligomers. In contrast to βarr2, βarr1 has no NES in its carboxyl-terminal tail and is both nuclear and cytosolic at steady state (Fig. 6B, upper panels). In cells co-expressing βarr1 and βarr2, however, βarr1 was excluded from the nucleus, indicative of its cytosolic retention through hetero-oligomerization with βarr2 (Fig. 6B, lower panels). Although oligomerization of βarrs has not been documented so far, previous studies on visual arrestin in vitro have proposed a model in which oligomerization would prevent the inappropriate activation of arrestin and subsequent deleterious cellular effects. To verify whether this hypothesis could be valid for βarrs, we studied the effect of forced and controlled βarr oligomerization on βarr activity. We designed a construct in which a FKBP binding motif was fused downstream of the βarr2 carboxyl-terminal tail and upstream of GFP (βarr2-FKBP-GFP). Using an anisotropy-based living cell imaging system (see supplemental material) we verified that, upon addition of the FKBP-dimerizing small molecule AP20187, the totality of βarr2 fusion proteins was clustered through FKBP dimerization (supplemental Fig. 1A and supplemental TABLE ONE). Upon angiotensin AT1AR stimulation, pre-oligomerized βarr2-FKBP-GFP translocated to the activated receptors and accumulated in clathrin-coated pits and endosomes with the same kinetics as non-dimerized controls (supplemental Fig. 1B and data not shown). These data indicate that the oligomeric organization of βarr2 molecules per se does not prevent their reactivity to receptor activation. We have provided biochemical and biophysical evidence for the existence of constitutive βarr homo- and hetero-oligomers. The ability of βarr2 to self-associate and form hetero-oligomers with βarr1 was first documented by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Resonance energy transfer-based approaches demonstrated the presence of homo- and hetero-oligomers in intact cells at physiological concentrations of βarrs. Finally, NES mutant or wild type forms of βarr2 altered the subcellular localization of wild type βarr2 and βarr1, respectively. The approaches we used cannot discriminate, however, between a simple dimerization and more complex organizations of monomers, such as tetramers composed of 2 dimers, reported for visual arrestin (9Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H.W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The actual proportion of monomeric (if they exist in vivo) versus oligomeric βarrs remains to be established, as saturation BRET experiments can measure the propensity of two partners to interact but do not detect free monomers. It has been proposed that because of the high concentration of visual arrestin in the retina, oligomerization would limit the availability of active monomeric species (13Schubert C. Hirsch J.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21186-21190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which might be harmful for the retina if present in excess (28Alloway P.G. Howard L. Dolph P.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 129-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Data reported here indicate that oligomerization may actually occur in living cells at physiological concentrations of βarrs, which are far below than those of visual arrestins in the retina. In addition, we have shown that artificially oligomerized βarr2 fully retains its capacity to translocate to activated GPCRs. Although our data are not sufficient to disprove the model of monomers constituting the active form of βarrs, an alternative plausible model emerges, in which oligomers might represent an important functional form of βarrs. Recent studies mapping the arrestin-receptor interface, identified arrestin elements implicated in receptor binding on the concave sides of the two globular domains (29Vishnivetskiy S.A. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1262-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Phosphate binding residues (contributing to the phosphate sensor, which recognizes phosphorylated GPCRs) are localized to the NH2-terminal globular domain, whereas other residues, which are involved in the binding to cytoplasmic unphosphorylated elements of the receptor (which sense the activation and determine the specificity), are distributed in both domains. It is well established that βarrs are capable of interacting with multiple proteins of MAP kinase cascades via the same globular domains while still binding to the activated GPCRs (30Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Therefore, the oligomeric organization of βarrs might facilitate their interaction with multiple partners at the same time. Also, consistent with the hypothesis that βarr oligomerization might contribute to MAP kinase activation is a recent study showing that dimerization of MEKK2 (an upstream activator of JNK) through its catalytic domain is essential to propagate the activation cascade (31Cheng J. Yu L. Zhang D. Huang Q. Spencer D. Su B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13477-13482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Whether the interaction with activated GPCRs physiologically involves arrestin monomers or oligomers, as receptor-βarr complexes rapidly accumulate in clathrin-coated pits, (18Scott M.G. Benmerah A. Muntaner O. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3552-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to speculate that oligomers, if not preformed, are enriched in these compartments because of the much higher local concentration of βarrs. Additional functions of βarr2 have been recently associated with its capacity of shuttling permanently between the cytosol and the nucleus. In particular βarr2 titrates JNK3 out of the nucleus (6Scott M.G. Le Rouzic E. Perianin A. Pierotti V. Enslen H. Benichou S. Marullo S. Benmerah A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37693-37701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and increases the activity of p53 by relocalizing the E3 ligase Mdm2 from the nucleus to the cytosol (8Wang P. Gao H. Ni Y. Wang B. Wu Y. Ji L. Qin L. Ma L. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6363-6370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Since we reported here that βarr2 also retains βarr1 in the cytosol through hetero-dimerization, nuclear βarr1 availability and functions may vary depending on the specific stoichiometry of the two isoforms. So far, there is limited information on the physiological nuclear effects of βarr1. Still, in the context of the GPCR-mediated anti-inflammatory response, it was reported that βarr1 modulates NF-κB activation likely through a direct effect in the nucleus (32Gao H. Sun Y. Wu Y. Luan B. Wang Y. Qu B. Pei G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 303-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have shown that the self-association properties of βarrs, initially hypothesized from crystallographic data, result in the presence of oligomers in living cells. In addition, the subcellular distribution of βarrs can be modulated through oligomerization suggesting that the quaternary structure of βarrs may control at least part of their biological functions.

https://openalex.org/W2132190297,"The junctional adhesion molecule-C (JAM-C) was recently shown to be a counter receptor for the leukocyte beta2-integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), thereby mediating interactions between vascular cells, particularly in inflammatory cell recruitment. Here, we investigated the role of JAM-C in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-mediated leukocyte recruitment. As compared with normal arteries, immunostaining of atherosclerotic vessels revealed a high expression of JAM-C in association with neointimal smooth muscle cells and the endothelium. Moreover, JAM-C was strongly up-regulated in the spontaneous early lesions in ApoE -/- mice. In vitro, cultured human arterial smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were found to express JAM-C, and oxLDL, as well as enzymatically modified LDL (eLDL) significantly up-regulated JAM-C on both HASMC and endothelial cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Although under quiescent conditions, JAM-C predominantly localized to interendothelial cell-cell contacts in close proximity to zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), oxLDL treatment induced a disorganization of JAM-C localization that was no more restricted to the interendothelial junctions. JAM-C thereby mediated both leukocyte adhesion and leukocyte transendothelial migration upon oxLDL treatment of endothelial cells, whereas JAM-C on quiescent endothelial cells only mediates leukocyte transmigration. Thus, upon oxLDL stimulation endothelial JAM-C functions as both an adhesion, as well as a transmigration receptor for leukocytes. Taken together, JAM-C is up-regulated by oxLDL and may thereby contribute to increased inflammatory cell recruitment during atherosclerosis. JAM-C may therefore provide a novel molecular target for antagonizing interactions between vascular cells in atherosclerosis."

However, the molecules that direct these events remain poorly defined. In the developing spinal cord, the differentiation of motor neuron progenitors into postmitotic motor neurons is regulated by retinoid signaling. Here, we identify a retinoid-inducible gene, GDE2 (glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 2), encoding a six-transmembrane protein that is necessary and sufficient to drive spinal motor neuron differentiation in vivo. A single amino acid mutation in the extracellular catalytic domain abolishes protein function. This reveals a critical role for glycerophosphodiester metabolism in motor neuron differentiation."

To address this issue, we sought viruses for CypA independence using Debio-025, a cyclosporine A (CsA) analog that disrupts CypA-capsid interaction. Surprisingly, viral variants from the Main group replicate even in the presence of the drug. Sequencing analyses revealed that these viruses encode capsid substitutions within the CypA-binding site (V86P/H87Q/I91V/M96I).

This is the first demonstration that isolates from the Main group naturally develop CypA-independent strategies to replicate in human cells. Surprisingly, we found that these capsid substitutions render HIV-1 capable of infecting Owl monkey (OMK) cells that highly restrict HIV-1. OMK cell resistance to HIV-1 is mediated via TRIM-Cyp, which arose from a retrotransposition of CypA into the TRIM5 α gene. Interestingly, saturation experiments suggest that the Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 capsid core is “invisible” to TRIM-Cyp.

CypA-capsid interaction can be competitively disrupted by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A (CsA), which binds to the hydrophobic pocket of CypA (2Thali M. Bukovsky A. Kondo E. Rosenwirth B.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1300-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) or in cells treated with small interference RNA that target the CypA gene (9Liu S. Asparuhova M. Brondani V. Ziekau I.

Virol. 2004; 78: 12800-12808Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that the CypA in target cells rather than the CypA in virus producer cells is required for optimal HIV-1 infectivity in human cells (10Sokolskaja E. Sayah D.M. Luban J. J.

To date, the block of infectivity has been attributed to post-entry events prior to integration (14Steinkasserer A. Harrison R. Billich A. Hammerschmid F. Werner G. Wolff B. Peichl P. Palfi G.

Although the CypA-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infectivity in human cells was discovered more than a decade ago (1Franke E.K. Yuan H.E. Luban J. Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 2Thali M. Bukovsky A. Kondo E. Rosenwirth B. Walsh C.T. Sodroski J. Gottlinger H.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), its role in the HIV-1 life cycle as well as the mechanisms that govern it remain obscure. Because CypA catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of the Gly89-Pro90 peptide bond of capsid (16Bosco D.A. Eisenmesser E.Z. Pochapsky S. Sundquist W.I. Kern D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5247-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and the capsid core likely undergoes an ordered uncoating in order to deliver the viral genome into the cytosol of target cells, it has been proposed that CypA orchestrates HIV-1 uncoating in human target cells (17Luban J. Cell. 1996; 87: 1157-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), although no experimental evidence has been reported to support this model. However, observations in monkey cells may help us to understand the role of CypA in HIV-1 infection. Paradoxically, recent findings point to a detrimental role for CypA in HIV-1 infection in monkey cells. Towers et al. (18Towers G.J. Hatziioannou T. Cowan S. Goff S.P. Luban J. Bieniasz P.D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) found that CypA-capsid interactions are responsible for the inability of HIV-1 to infect owl monkey (OMK) cells. OMK cells are normally highly refractory to HIV-1 infection; however, CsA renders them permissive to HIV-1 (18Towers G.J. Hatziioannou T. Cowan S. Goff S.P. Luban J. Bieniasz P.D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Moreover, the introduction of a mutation in the CypA binding region of capsid (G89V), which abolishes CypA-capsid contact, renders the mutant virus capable of infecting OMK cells (1Franke E.K. Yuan H.E. Luban J. Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Supporting the hypothesis that CypA or CypA-like proteins are responsible for the refractivity of OMK cell to HIV-1, two studies elegantly showed that OMK cell resistance to HIV-1 is mediated via a TRIM-Cyp chimeric protein, which arose from a retrotransposition of CypA into the TRIM5 α gene (19Nisole S. Lynch C. Stoye J.P. Yap M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13324-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20Sayah D.M. Sokolskaja E. Berthoux L. Luban J. Nature. 2004; 430: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Thus, CypA and CypA-like proteins possess the capacities to influence either positively (human cells) or negatively (OMK cells) HIV-1 infectivity of primates. The mechanisms that dictate whether CypA has a beneficial or detrimental effect on HIV-1 infection in primate cells are totally unknown. In the present study, we asked if a naturally occurring HIV-1 variant exists that circumvents both CypA dependence in human cells and TRIM-Cyp sensitivity in OMK cells. The identification of which molecular feature that renders HIV-1 susceptible or resistant to CypA dependence is imperative to shed light on the functions of CypA in HIV-1 infection in primate cells. human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside green fluorescent protein cyclosporine A cyclophilin A Owl monkey cells vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside green fluorescent protein cyclosporine A cyclophilin A Owl monkey cells vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. Viruses and Cells—All HIV-1 isolates were obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. The pNL4.3-GFP plasmid was provided by C. Aiken and D. Gabuzda. Capsid mutants were generated as described previously (21von Schwedler U. Song J. Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4945-4955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obviate specific cell entry requirements, all pNL4.3-GFP viruses were pseudotyped with the VSVG envelope generously provided by D. Trono. TZM-bl cells (contributed by J. C. Kappes, X. Wu, and Tranzyme, Inc.) were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. CCR5+ Jurkat T cells were provided by M. Emerman, whereas OMK cells were provided by G. Towers and C. Aiken. CsA and Debio-025 were provided by Sigma and Debiopharm, respectively. Capsid NL4.3 (R9) and pNL4.3-GFP mutant viruses were generated by PCR mutagenesis and by liposome-mediated transfection of 293T cells using Genejuice (Novagen). Viral supernatants were harvested 48 h post-transfection and filtered through a 0.2-μm pore size filter to remove cellular debris. Viral inoculum was standardized by exoRT assay or p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Infections—TZM-bl and OMK cells (80,000 or 20,000 cells/well/ml) were seeded for 24 h pre-infection in 24-well plates. Cells were exposed to HIV-1 in the presence of 5 μg/ml polybrene. CsA or Debio-025, at the concentrations indicated, were added 15 min prior to virus addition. Infected cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (GFP content), by X-gal staining (counting blue foci) or by β-galactosidase activity 48 h post-infection. For β-galactosidase activity, infected TZM-bl cells were washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Plates were stored at -80 °C for 16 h and thawed on ice, and 20 μl of lysate was transferred to a 96-well plate for detecting β-galactosidase activity. Galacton-Star substrate (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA) was diluted 1:50 in the reaction buffer diluent (100 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% Sapphire-II™ enhancer) to make the reaction buffer. 100 μl of reaction buffer was added to 20 μl of lysate, and the light emission was measured over 1 s in a microplate luminometer after 30 min. For saturation experiments, OMK cells were initially exposed to increasing amounts of wild-type or mutant NL4.3 (R9) viruses that do not encode GFP and subsequently (5 min later) exposed to wild-type or mutant NL4.3 viruses that do encode GFP. Western Blot Analysis—Purification and immunoblot analysis of viruses produced from 293T-transfected cells were conducted as previously described (21von Schwedler U. Song J. Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4945-4955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CsA and Debio-025 were added 24 h post-infection, and viruses were collected 48 h post-transfection. Rabbit anti-capsid was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, whereas rabbit anti-CypA serum was obtained by immunization with recombinant human CypA protein. Pharmacological Prevention of CypA-Capsid Interactions—To identify HIV-1 variants refractory to both human and OMK CypA-mediated activities, we first searched for viruses that do not rely on CypA to optimally infect human cells. To address this issue, we sought conditions that abrogate CypA-capsid interactions in human cells. CsA binds CypA and prevents interaction between CypA and HIV-1 capsid, but it also exhibits an immunosuppressive activity, which complicates the interpretation of its effect on HIV-1 replication. To examine the effect of CypA-capsid interactions on HIV-1 replication exclusively, we sought CsA analogs, which prevent CypA-capsid interactions, but are not immunosuppressive. We used a CsA analog, Debio-025, which lacks the immunosuppressive effect usually associated with CsA but nevertheless retains an inhibitory activity against HIV-1. The non-immunosuppressive CsA analog Debio-025 is a derivative of the non-immunosuppressive CsA analog, SDZ-811, which prevents CypA-capsid interactions and HIV-1 infectivity (22Rosenwirth B. Billich A. Datema R. Donatsch P. Hammerschmid F. Harrison R. Hiestand P. Jaksche H. Mayer P. Peichl P. Antimicrob. Agents Che-mother. 1994; 38: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Mlynar E. Bevec D. Billich A. Rosenwirth B. Steinkasserer A. J. Gen.

Virol. 1995; 69: 2451-2461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first compared the efficiencies of CsA and Debio-025 to prevent CypA-capsid interactions by examining their potential to inhibit CypA incorporation into virions. 293T cells were transfected with proviral HIV-1 NL4.3 plasmid in the presence of CsA or Debio-025. Viruses were analyzed for their CypA content as described previously (21von Schwedler U. Song J. Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4945-4955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We found that 0.5 and 1 μm of CsA partially blocked CypA incorporation, whereas 8 μm significantly abrogated CypA incorporation. In contrast, Debio-025 at a concentration as low as 0.5 μm prevents CypA packaging. Thus, Debio-025 is particularly well-suited to identify HIV-1 variants that do not depend on CypA-capsid interactions for optimal infection in human cells. Naturally Occurring HIV-1 Isolates Derived from the Main Group Replicate in Human Cells Independently of CypA—To identify HIV-1 isolates that do not rely on CypA to infect human cells, we used TZM-bl HeLa cells that express β-galactosidase after infection with HIV-1. To determine if HIV-1 requires CypA-capsid interactions to infect TZM-bl cells, Debio-025 was added to target cells 15 min prior to addition of virus. By adding Debio-025 to target TZM-bl cells, we anticipate that the drug, by saturating cytosolic CypA, prevents CypA recruitment onto the incoming viral capsid and therefore decreases HIV-1 infectivity. Supporting this hypothesis, Debio-025, even at low concentrations, inhibits HIV-1 infectivity (Fig. 2). It is critical to emphasize that the 2- to 3-fold decrease of infectivity, although modest, is always consistent between experiments using TZM cells. Note that we obtained similar results using CCR5+ Jurkat cells (data not shown); however, given that the assay using TZM-bl cells is quicker (48 h instead of 2 weeks) than the assay using CCR5+ Jurkat cells that do not contain a reporter gene, we preferred using TZM-bl cells as targets to screen a large panel of isolates. Forty-two viruses from different clades and with different co-receptor usage were used to infect TZM-bl cells in the presence of Debio-025. We found that a majority of viruses are highly sensitive to Debio-025 and possess a mean 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.097 μm± 0.029 (n = 27) (TABLE ONE). Furthermore, we found that a few viruses are partially resistant to Debio-025 with IC50 values of 1.98 μm± 0.48 (n = 10) (highlighted in green in TABLE ONE). Importantly, we found that two viruses derived from the Main group (M group) are highly resistant to Debio-025 with IC50 values of 8.5 μm± 0.1 (n = 2) (highlighted in pink in TABLE ONE). The definitions of “partially resistant” and “highly resistant” viruses are arbitrary. The “highly resistant viruses” are the two viruses that exhibit an IC50 of >2.5 μm Debio-025; similarly “partially resistant viruses” are the ten viruses that possess IC50 values between 1.5 and 2.5 μm of Debio-025. All the other viruses that exhibit an IC50 of <0.17 μm are termed “sensitive viruses”. Amounts of Debio-025 necessary to decrease the infectivity of the 42 viruses are lower (TABLE ONE) than those used to decrease NL4.3 infectivity in HeLa cells (Fig. 2), because we used less virus (100 pg instead of 1 ng). We obtained similar results for the resistant viruses, using Debio-025-treated CCR5+ Jurkat cells, by monitoring viral replication by p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay over a period of 3 weeks (data not shown). Thus, we identified for the first time HIV-1 isolates from the Main Group that do not rely on CypA to optimally infect human cells. Interestingly, among the 42 isolates tested, only R5 and R5X4 viruses were found to partially or highly resist to Debio-025 (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEResistance of HIV-1 to Debio-025 Open table in a new tab HIV-1 CypA-independent Infection of Human Cells Correlates with the Presence of Specific Residues within the CypA-binding Site of Capsid—We then asked if this CypA independence correlates with specific residues in the CypA binding region of HIV-1 capsid. To address this issue, we sequenced the CypA binding region of capsid for a majority of the 42 viruses amplified in CCR5+ Jurkat T cells (TABLE ONE). Interestingly, we found that four capsid residues in positions 86, 87, 91, and 96, which are normally well conserved among all HIV-1 subtypes (Fig. 3), were frequently substituted in viruses that are partially or highly resistant to Debio-025 (TABLE ONE). The most commonly occurring capsid sequence contains residues Val86, His87, Ile91, and Met96 (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the two viruses that are highly resistant to Debio-025, RU570 and RU132, have all four residues mutated: Pro86, Gln87, Val91, and Ile96 for RU570 and Gln86, Gln87, Phe91, and Ile96 for RU132 (TABLE ONE). It is also interesting to note that two consensuses contain frequent substitutions at these positions: consensus G that contains Gln86, Gln87, Ile91, and Ile96 and consensus O that contains Pro86, Ala87, Leu91, and Ile96 (Fig. 3). Supporting the possibility that substitutions at these specific positions of capsid mediate CypA independence of HIV-1, we found here that the two highly Debio-025-resistant RU570 and RU132 viruses are derived from consensus G (TABLE ONE). Moreover, previous work showed that two isolates from the Outlier group (group O) infect human cells even in the presence of cyclosporine A (25Braaten D. Franke E.K. Luban J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4220-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wiegers K. Krausslich H.G. Virology. 2002; 294: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Altogether these data indicate that naturally occurring mutations in capsid can substitute for the need for CypA for optimal HIV-1 infection of human cells. To determine if these residues govern CypA independence, we introduced them in the capsid region of a virus, which is normally highly sensitive to Debio-025 and NL4.3 (TABLE ONE) and which contains the most commonly occurring capsid residues (Val86, His87, Ile91, and Met96) (Fig. 3), and asked whether these mutations confer CypA independence. Using the highly resistant RU570 capsid sequence as a template, we created single, double, triple, and quadruple mutations in the context of the proviral molecular clone NL4.3. Viruses were produced from 293T-transfected cells and used to infect TZM-bl cells as above. Debio-025 significantly reduced the infectivity of wild-type NL4.3 virus (Fig. 4A). As a control, we used a capsid mutant, which cannot bind CypA (NL4.3 G89V) (1Franke E.K. Yuan H.E. Luban J. Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). This mutant, like the CsA-treated wild-type virus, exhibited a significant defect in infectivity, further reinforcing the notion that CypA is necessary for optimal HIV-1 infectivity in human cells. We found that single and double mutants are still sensitive to Debio-025 (Fig. 4A). In sharp contrast, the infectivity of the triple or quadruple mutant viruses is weakly influenced by Debio-025 (Fig. 4A). This strongly suggests that a combination of three to four capsid substitutions (TABLE ONE) renders HIV-1 CypA independent in human cells. We obtained similar Debio-025 resistance results using physiological peripheral blood mononuclear as target cells (data not shown). One possibility why naturally occurring HIV-1 variants derived from the Main group did not rely on CypA to infect human cells is that, like HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus, they do not bind CypA, explaining their resistance to CsA and CsA-analogs (2Thali M. Bukovsky A. Kondo E. Rosenwirth B. Walsh C.T. Sodroski J. Gottlinger H.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 25Braaten D. Franke E.K. Luban J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4220-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we found that all Debio-025-resistant HIV-1 viruses, including the variant that contains the four capsid substitutions (Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96), incorporate wild-type levels of CypA (data not shown and Fig. 4B). Moreover, Debio-025 prevented CypA incorporation into these viruses at a degree similar to that in the wild-type virus (Fig. 4B). This indicates that these naturally occurring HIV-1 variants derived from the Main group bind CypA well but do not rely on it to optimally infect human cells. Altogether these data suggest that HIV-1 variants, which naturally pre-exist in the Main group, contain specific residues in the unique exposed loop of capsid that permit infectivity of human cells independently of the CypA recruitment onto the capsid core in the cytosol of target cells. Capsid Substitutions That Permit CypA Independence in Human Cells Render HIV-1 Capable of Infecting Refractory Owl Monkey Cells—Although CypA-capsid interactions positively influence HIV-1 infectivity of human cells, they negatively influence HIV-1 infectivity of OMK cells. Specifically, CsA restores HIV-1 infectivity in OMK cells that normally highly restrict HIV-1 (18Towers G.J. Hatziioannou T. Cowan S. Goff S.P. Luban J. Bieniasz P.D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Moreover, a capsid mutant virus (G89V), which cannot bind CypA, is capable of infecting OMK cells (18Towers G.J. Hatziioannou T. Cowan S. Goff S.P. Luban J. Bieniasz P.D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that a TRIM-Cyp chimeric protein mediates HIV-1 restriction in OMK cells (19Nisole S. Lynch C. Stoye J.P. Yap M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13324-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20Sayah D.M. Sokolskaja E. Berthoux L. Luban J. Nature. 2004; 430: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the CypA moiety of TRIM-Cyp is responsible for the recognition of the incoming HIV-1 capsid core (19Nisole S. Lynch C. Stoye J.P. Yap M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13324-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In this model, preventing TRIM-Cyp-capsid core interaction, either by CsA or by point mutation in the CypA-binding site of capsid, restores HIV-1 infectivity in OMK cells. Thus, after revealing the existence of naturally occurring HIV-1 variants that circumvent CypA dependence in human cells, we asked whether these variants could escape the CypA-mediated infectivity block in OMK cells. To address this issue, OMK cells were infected with wild-type virus (WT NL4.3) that binds CypA, a virus that does not bind CypA (G89V NL4.3), and a virus that binds CypA but does not require CypA to infect human cells (Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 NL4.3). We found that wild-type virus infects OMK cells poorly, even at a high inoculum (100 ng of p24) (∼1% of infected cells) (Fig. 5), suggesting that OMK cells contain restriction factors that are extremely potent at blocking HIV-1 infectivity. The addition of Debio-025 to OMK cells partially removes the block of infectivity of the wild-type virus (∼20% of infected cells at 100 ng of p24) (Fig. 5). Moreover, the virus, which does not bind CypA (G89V), infected OMK cells well (∼38 and 58% of infected cells at 50 ng and 100 ng of p24, respectively) (Fig. 5). The fact that the ablation of CypA-capsid interactions (G89V or Debio-025) promotes HIV-1 infectivity in OMK cells supports the notion that TRIM-Cyp mediates HIV-1 blockade in OMK cells (19Nisole S. Lynch C. Stoye J.P. Yap M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13324-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20Sayah D.M. Sokolskaja E. Berthoux L. Luban J. Nature. 2004; 430: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Debio-025 had no effect on the infectivity of the virus, which did not bind CypA (G89V) (Fig. 5). Note that the infectivity of the virus that does not bind CypA (G89V) remains superior to that of wild-type virus in the presence of Debio-025 (Fig. 5). This suggests that either the Debio-025 saturation of TRIM-Cyp in OMK cells is not optimal, or that OMK cells contain additional inhibitory factors, which bind capsid via the residue Gly89 but are not sensitive to Debio-025. Importantly, the infectivity of the virus that binds CypA but does not require CypA to infect human cells (Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 NL4.3), was superior to that of the wild-type virus (i.e. ∼20-fold increase at 50 and 100 ng of p24) (Fig. 5). This indicates that the Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 substitutions render HIV-1 resistant (at least partly) to the CypA-mediated OMK restriction. Interestingly, the infectivity of Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 NL4.3 perfectly mirrored the infectivity of the wild-type virus in the presence of Debio-025 (Fig. 5), suggesting that the Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 NL4.3 escapes the block mediated by Debio-025-sensitive inhibitory factors in OMK cells (i.e. TRIM-Cyp). However, Debio-025 further enhances the capacity of Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 NL4.3 to infect OMK cells (∼3-fold) (Fig. 5). This suggests that the Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 capsid core is not totally impervious to Debio-025-sensitive OMK inhibitors (i.e. TRIM-Cyp). Supporting this notion, the infectivity of G89V NL4.3 was superior to that of Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 NL4.3 in the absence of Debio-025 (Fig. 5). Nonetheless, the rescue in infectivity of wild-type NL4.3 by Debio-025 was superior to that of Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 NL4.3 (10-fold versus 3-fold). Together these data strongly suggest that the wild-type capsid core is highly vulnerable to inhibitors OMK (i.e. whereas TRIM-Cyp), the Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 capsid core possesses intrinsic capacities to partly circumvent these factors. Capsid That Permits HIV-1 CypA Independence in Human Cells Does Not Saturate OMK Restriction Factors—When OMK cells are exposed to a first viral challenge (using virus-like particles), they become more susceptible to a second viral challenge (18Towers G.J. Hatziioannou T. Cowan S. Goff S.P. Luban J. Bieniasz P.D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). This observation led researchers to postulate that OMK cells contain inhibitory factors that are saturable (18Towers G.J. Hatziioannou T. Cowan S. Goff S.P. Luban J. Bieniasz P.D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). One possibility to explain why the Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 NL4.3 virus is more competent to infect OMK cells than wild-type virus is that its capsid core is less well recognized by the saturable inhibitory factors. To test this hypothesis, OMK cells were pre-challenged with either wild-type or Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 viruses and subsequently exposed to wild-type HIV-1. As above, in the absence of pre-challenge, wild-type HIV-1 barely infects OMK cells. In contrast, pre-challenging OMK cells with increasing amounts of wild-type virus (100, 500, and 1000 ng of p24) allows wild-type HIV-1 capable of infecting these cells (Fig. 6, right panel). This is in accordance with the hypothesis that an initial viral challenge can saturate inhibitory factors present in OMK cells (18Towers G.J. Hatziioannou T. Cowan S. Goff S.P. Luban J. Bieniasz P.D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 19Nisole S. Lynch C. Stoye J.P. Yap M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13324-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20Sayah D.M. Sokolskaja E. Berthoux L. Luban J. Nature. 2004; 430: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, pre-challenging OMK cells with increasing amounts of the Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 virus renders target cells minimally more permissive to a subsequent wild-type virus exposure (Fig. 6, left panel). Similarly, we found that a pre-challenge with G89V NL4.3 virus does not affect the refractivity of OMK cells as previously reported (18Towers G.J. Hatziioannou T. Cowan S. Goff S.P. Luban J. Bieniasz P.D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Our observation that the Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 viral pre-challenge does not alleviate the block in OMK cells suggests that the Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 capsid core cannot saturate the OMK inhibitory factors. This strongly suggests that the Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 capsid core is less well recognized by the OMK inhibitory factors than wild-type capsid core. This capsid core “invisibility” may explain the enhanced capacity of the Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 virus to infect OMK cells. Together our data reveal that naturally occurring HIV-1 variants exist that circumvent both CypA dependence in human cells and TRIM-Cyp sensitivity in OMK cells. In this study, we identified naturally occurring HIV-1 isolates from the Main group that do not depend on CypA for optimal infection of human cells. Sequencing analyses revealed that these viruses contain specific residues at specific positions in the CypA-binding site of capsid. To determine whether these residues mediate CypA independence, we introduced them into viruses that normally highly depend on CypA. Importantly, these viruses no longer depend on CypA for infection after the introduction of these capsid substitutions. These findings demonstrate that naturally pre-existing residues located at specific positions within capsid can render HIV-1 capable of optimally infecting human cells even in the absence of CypA. An analysis of 2599 HIV-1 capsid sequences available from the Los Alamos Data base indicates that 3.35% of the capsid sequences contain the V86P substitution, 19.74% contain H87Q, 27.36% contain I91V, and 15.31% contain M96I (Fig. 7). We also found that 46.44% (1207/2599) have no change from the His87/Ile91/Met96 consensus, whereas 7% (182/2599) of the capsid sequences have a change in all three locations. Moreover, 45.48% (1182/2599) have no change from the Val86/His87/Ile91/Met96 consensus, whereas 3.89% (101/2599) of the capsid sequences have a change in all four locations. The two consensuses G and O contain frequent substitutions at these positions (Fig. 3). Supporting the possibility that substitutions at these specific positions of capsid mediate CypA independence, the two highly Debio-025-resistant RU570 and RU132 viruses are derived from consensus G (TABLE ONE) and two isolates from the consensus O, viruses 5180 and 9435, that infect human cells even in the presence of CsA (25Braaten D. Franke E.K. Luban J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4220-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wiegers K. Krausslich H.G. Virology. 2002; 294: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) contain Pro86/Ala87/Leu91/Ile96 and Gln86/Ala87/Leu91/Ile96 capsid substitutions, respectively (26Wiegers K. Krausslich H.G. Virology. 2002; 294: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). During the course of this study, Ikeda et al. (13Ikeda Y. Ylinen L.M. Kahar-Bador M. Towers G.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11816-11822Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) also found that substitutions within capsid correlate with CsA resistance in human cells. Specifically, Ikeda et al. (13Ikeda Y. Ylinen L.M. Kahar-Bador M. Towers G.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11816-11822Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) transferred the full-length gag gene of eleven HIV-1 isolates into a CsA-sensitive NL4.3 backbone and tested the resulting chimeric viruses for their resistance to CsA in human cells. They found that the Gag region of four viruses (89.6, Gun WT, Gun V, and 93BR) also confers CsA resistance in human cells (13Ikeda Y. Ylinen L.M. Kahar-Bador M. Towers G.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11816-11822Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). They also identified a triple Pro86/Gln87/Val91 capsid substitution that renders HIV-1 partially resistant to CsA. We confirmed these data by showing that the Pro86/Gln87/Val91 resistance to Debio-025 is very similar to those of the two variants that we identified in this study, the triple Gln87/Val91/Ile96 and quadruple Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 HIV-1 variants (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, Kootstra et al. identified another CsA-resistant HIV-1 variant (Pro86/Gln87/Pro88/Val91) (11Kootstra N.A. Munk C. Tonnu N. Landau N.R. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1298-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which distinct is from that of Ikeda et al. (Pro86/Gln87/Ala88/Val91) (13Ikeda Y. Ylinen L.M. Kahar-Bador M. Towers G.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11816-11822Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and of ours (Val86/Gln87/Ala88/Val91/Ile96 and Pro86/Gln87/Ala88/Val91/Ile96). Given that we showed that the Gln87/Val91, Gln87/Ile96 and Val91/Ile96 double mutations do not suffice to render HIV-1 resistant to CsA or Debio-025, altogether these data suggest that a combination of three to four capsid substitutions allows HIV-1 capable of escaping the drug pressure and of replicating in a CypA-independent manner. Ikeda et al. (13Ikeda Y. Ylinen L.M. Kahar-Bador M. Towers G.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11816-11822Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) also presented evidence that the H87Q substitution alone renders NL4.3 more resistant to CsA. However, we found in this study that H87Q alone or in combination with I91V or M96I (double substitutions) does not suffice to render HIV-1 impervious to Debio-025 (Fig. 4A). Indeed, the H87Q substitution renders HIV-1 Debio-025-resistant and CypA-independent in human cells only in the context of the triple (H87Q/I91V/M96I) and the quadruple (V86P/H87Q/I91V/M96I) substitutions. Supporting the notion that the His87 substitution alone does not dictate CsA resistance, the His87 residue was also found substituted in two CsA-sensitive group O viruses, 13470 and 8913 (H87P and H87A for 13470 and 8913, respectively) (26Wiegers K. Krausslich H.G. Virology. 2002; 294: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The apparent discrepancy between Ikeda's study and ours may simply result from the use of different target cells. Specifically, Ikeda et al. (13Ikeda Y. Ylinen L.M. Kahar-Bador M. Towers G.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11816-11822Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) used TE671 cells, whereas we used HeLa cells. Previous studies showed that the intrinsic cellular concentration of CypA modulates the resistance of HIV-1 to CsA (27Yin L. Braaten D. Luban J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6430-6436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ackerson B. Rey O. Canon J. Krogstad P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 303-308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that HeLa cells contain more or less CypA than TE671 cells, explaining why the H87Q virus is sensitive to the drug in HeLa cells, but not in TE671 cells. Moreover, we used Debio-025, whereas Ikeda et al. used CsA. Our observation that Debio-025 is more efficient at disrupting CypA-capsid interaction (Fig. 1) may also explain why the H87Q virus is sensitive to Debio-25 but not to CsA. It is important to emphasize that Ikeda et al. and Kootstra et al. used HIV-1-based vectors, which contain a capsid region amplified by PCR, lack Nef (due to the inserted GFP gene), lack gp160 and are VSVG-pseudotyped. In contrast, in this study, we used “real” viruses: primary isolates derived from patients and amplified in physiological peripheral blood mononuclear cells. One of our goals of performing an extensive phenotypic analysis of HIV-1 variants for CypA dependence using “real” primary isolates rather than HIV-1-based vectors was to provide background information for the in vivo use of Debio-025 as a therapeutic agent. Previous work showed that single point mutations (Glu92 or Asp94) emerge in the capsid of NL4.3 under CsA selection, but in contrast to our naturally occurring CypA-independent viruses, the artificial A92E or G94D viruses require CsA to replicate in HeLa cells (29Aberham C. Weber S. Phares W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3536-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Braaten D. Aberham C. Franke E.K. Yin L. Phares W. Luban J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5170-5176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The A92E or G94D capsid substitutions were not found among our panel of HIV-1 isolates, suggesting that these artificially induced capsid mutations do not pre-exist in the HIV-1 population. Because CypA-independent viruses are poorly represented among the HIV-1 population and that a majority of simian immunodeficiency virus isolates do not require CypA (at least to infect human cells), this suggests that CypA recruitment represents a major advantage for HIV-1 infection in human cells. Nevertheless, our present findings suggest that HIV-1 may exploit CypA-dependent and -independent strategies to guarantee optimal infection of human cells. After revealing the existence of naturally occurring HIV-1 variants that circumvent CypA dependence in human cells, we asked whether these variants could also escape the TRIM-Cyp-mediated infectivity block in OMK cells. In contrast to wild-type HIV-1, which fails to infect OMK cells even at a high inoculum, we found that the CypA-independent Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 virus infects OMK cells significantly. During the course of this study, two studies showed that viruses containing the H87Q substitution also exhibit a higher capacity to infect OMK cells than that of wild-type virus (13Ikeda Y. Ylinen L.M. Kahar-Bador M. Towers G.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11816-11822Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Owens C.M. Song B. Perron M.J. Yang P.C. Stremlau M. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 5423-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This further suggests that the CypA-binding site of capsid represents a major locus for TRIM-Cyp action. In contrast to wild-type virus, we found that the CypA-independent virus cannot saturate the OMK restriction. Given that it is thought that primate restrictions target the incoming virus at a post-entry step and that the locus for restriction resides in the viral capsid, our observations suggest that TRIM-Cyp fails to recognize the Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 incoming capsid core. This is intriguing given that native CypA likely binds Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 capsid. Indeed, we showed that CypA is packaged at wild-type level in the Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 virus (Fig. 4B). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that TRIM-Cyp binds differently to HIV-1 Gag than to the incoming capsid core. We tried to determine if TRIM-Cyp binds HIV-1 Gag by co-transfecting 293T cells with NL4.3 and OMK TRIM-Cyp and by looking for TRIM-Cyp incorporation into nascent viruses. Although TRIM-Cyp was abundantly expressed in transfected cells, we failed to detect TRIM-Cyp in pelleted particles by Western blot analysis (data not shown). This suggests that either TRIM-Cyp cannot bind NL4.3 Gag or that its subcellular localization prevents its packaging. Nevertheless, if CypA binds Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 capsid, we would expect TRIM-Cyp capable of recognizing the incoming Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 capsid core in the cytosol of OMK cells. Our observations, that Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 infectivity in OMK cells is lower than that of the G89V virus that cannot bind CypA and that Debio-025 boosts Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 infectivity, suggest that TRIM-Cyp recognizes, at least partially, incoming the Pro86/Gln87/Val91/Ile96 capsid core. Although further work is required to determine how these capsid substitutions render HIV-1 Debio-025-resistant and CypA-independent in human cells as well as competent for OMK infection, it is likely that these residues subtly modify the capsid loop structure in a way that circumvents CypA-mediated activities on the capsid core. Highlighting the importance of our findings, Debio-025 is currently being tested in a clinical trial for its anti-HIV-1 efficacy. By identifying naturally occurring primary isolates (and not VSVG-pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector-encoding mutated capsid) that resist to Debio-025, our study suggests that the use of Debio-025 or CsA analogs as therapeutic agents may fail in patients infected with viral variants that contain the capsid substitutions identified in this study (i.e. subtype G and O variants). Thus, our present data provide a molecular context for the interpretation of the results of this trial. We thank J. Kuhns for secretarial assistance, S. Turk for support of virus genotyping and scientific input, and B. Beer and G. Jandu for initial input on capsid sequences and alignments."
https://openalex.org/W1982137055,"Superfibronectin (sFN) is a fibronectin (FN) aggregate that is formed by mixing FN with anastellin, a fragment of the first type III domain of FN. However, the mechanism of this aggregation has not been clear. In this study, we found that anastellin co-precipitated with FN in a ratio of ∼4:1, anastellin:FN monomer. The primary binding site for anastellin was in the segment III1–3, which bound three molecules of anastellin and was able to form a precipitate without the rest of the FN molecule. Anastellin binding to III3 caused a conformational change in that domain that exposed a cryptic thermolysin-sensitive site. An additional anastellin binds to III11, where it enhances thermolysin digestion of III11. An engineered disulfide bond in III3 inhibited both aggregation and protease digestion, suggesting that the stability of III3 is a key factor in sFN formation. We propose a three-step model for sFN formation: 1) FN-III domains spontaneously unfold and refold; 2) anastellin binds to an unfolded domain, preventing its refolding and leaving it with exposed hydrophobic surfaces and β-sheet edges; and 3) these exposed elements bind to similar exposed elements on other molecules, leading to aggregation. The model is consistent with our observation that the kinetics of aggregation are first order, with a reaction time of 500–700 s. Similar mechanisms may contribute to the assembly of the native FN matrix.

The biological importance of FN during development and wound healing has been demonstrated by generating conventional and conditional FN knock-out mice and alternative splicing domain (EDA) knock-out and knock-in mice (2George E.L.

Whereas a large number of protein structures can be self-assembled from purified subunits (e.g. microtubules, actin filaments, collagen fibrils, and viruses capsids), FN fibrils have only been produced by living cells in culture. The cells in tissue culture can assemble FN matrix fibrils either from FN that they synthesize or from soluble FN added exogenously. Fibril assembly takes place on the cell surface and requires integrins (5Mosher D.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 214-222Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Wu C.Y. Keivens V.M. O'Toole T.E.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A fundamental deficit is our lack of knowledge of the structure of FN fibrils. FN molecules must be attached to each other to form the fibrils, but we do not know even the sites of contact between molecules nor the types of bonds that hold them together. Several attempts at in vitro assembly of FN have resulted in aggregates that may be related to FN matrix fibrils. For instance, aggregates could be formed when FN was partially denatured in guanidine HCl and incubated over time (10Mosher D.F. Johnson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6595-6601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Peters D.M.P. Chen Y. Zardi L. Brummel S. Microscopy Microanalysis. 1998; 4: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, these aggregates seemed to be mediated by disulfide bonding of two free cysteines, which are not involved in native FN fibril formation (12McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12210-12215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When FN is partially denatured and sheared in solution, the FN aggregates into mats with a distinctly fibrillar substructure (13Ejim O.S. Blunn G.W. Brown R.A. Biomaterials. 1993; 14: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14Brown R.A. Blunn G.W. Ejim O.S. Biomaterials. 1994; 15: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Phillips J.B. King V.R. Ward Z. Porter R.A. Priestley J.V. Brown R.A. Biomaterials. 2004; 25: 2769-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). An intriguing alternative method of fibril formation involved pulling fibrils from the surface of a FN solution. This method did not involve solution denaturation, but surface denaturation may have played a role (13Ejim O.S. Blunn G.W. Brown R.A. Biomaterials. 1993; 14: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These in vitro systems appear to have some relation to FN matrix assembly in vivo, but comparisons have not yet been followed up. A decade ago, Morla et al. (16Morla A. Zhang Z. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) reported that a small FN fragment, anastellin (originally called III1c), was able to induce aggregation and precipitation of FN in vitro. The aggregates had a partially fibrillar substructure that resembled FN fibrils at the light microscopic level. When FN was coated on plastic in the presence of anastellin, it had enhanced cell adhesion activity. The authors named the aggregate superfibronectin (sFN). Subsequent studies of anastellin have revealed potentially important biological activities when injected peritoneally into mice, including inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth (17Yi M. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These activities required plasma FN (18Yi M. Sakai T. Fassler R. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11435-11438Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), so it is likely that sFN plays a role. When tested in cell culture, Bourdoulous et al. (19Bourdoulous S. Orend G. Mackenna D.A. Pasqualini R. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) found that high concentrations of anastellin (20 μm) blocked FN matrix formation and caused an established matrix to disappear after 16 h of treatment. In contrast, Klein et al. (20Klein R.M. Zheng M. Ambesi A. Van De Water L. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4663-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) found that 20 μm anastellin caused no change in the FN matrix, except for loss of a particular epitope in EDA. However, their cultures were examined only after 1–2 h. Changes in cytoskeleton organization and signaling pathways have also been documented following treatment with anastellin (19Bourdoulous S. Orend G. Mackenna D.A. Pasqualini R. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 21Ambesi A. Klein R.M. Pumiglia K.M. McKeown-Longo P.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 148-156PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these studies on biological activities of anastellin, the biochemistry and structure of sFN itself has been little studied. The fibrillar structure of sFN aggregates suggested that the in vitro aggregation of anastellin and FN might be related to the assembly of FN fibrils in cell culture. Thus, understanding the structure of sFN may lead to insights on the structure and assembly of FN fibrils. A crucial step is to map the binding sites and determine the stoichiometry of anastellin binding to FN. Ingham et al. (22Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Huff S. Litvinovich S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1718-1724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) have shown that an anastellin-like peptide binds several proteolytic FN fragments. However, anastellin-binding sites on FN for sFN aggregation have not been mapped. In the present study we used a range of overlapping recombinant fragments to precisely map the binding sites for anastellin. We discovered that some segments of FN formed an aggregate with anastellin similar to sFN. This allowed us to determine the stoichiometry of binding. We also used a disulfide mutant to show that the unfolding of an FN-III domain is a key factor in aggregation. These results advance our understanding of the structure of sFN and provide new directions for determining the structure and assembly of native FN fibrils. Bacterially Expressed Proteins—Diagrams of all of the recombinant FN fragments used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. The anastellin expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Paula McKeown-Longo (Albany Medical College) (20Klein R.M. Zheng M. Ambesi A. Van De Water L. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4663-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). III7–10, III12–14, and III7–14 were recloned from pET11b expression vectors (23Aukhil I. Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J.

The additional sequence at the N terminus is MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHM. Fragments III1–12 (SGPV... TTLE; the FN sequence is underlined), III1–5 (SGPV... LQPGTS), III1–3 (SGPV... QQETC), III1–2 (SGPV... QTTAC), III1 with the C-terminal linker (SGPV... TTPFC), III2–12 (SPLV... TTLE), III2–5 (SPLV... LQPGTS), III2–3 (SPLV... QQETC), III2 (SPLV... QTTAC), III3–12 (APDA... TTLE), III3–5 (APDA... LQPGTS), III3 (APDA... QQETC), III4–12 (TVPS... TTLE), III4–7 (TVPS... TIIP), III4–5 (TVPS... LQPGTS), III10–12 (VSDV... TTLE), and III13–15 (NVSP.. .TDDS) were also cloned into pET15b expression vectors as described previously (23Aukhil I. Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2542-2553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the constructs have additional residues at the C terminus; Cys was added for potential labeling, and Thr-Ser were created by the insertion of a restriction enzyme site for potential cloning. Following expression in Escherichia coli M15 for anastellin and BL21(DE3) for the FN fragments, most of the recombinant proteins were soluble and were purified with a cobalt-agarose column (TALON; Clontech) using standard procedures. However, anastellin was always in the insoluble pellet of the bacterial lysate and required renaturation. The pellet was solubilized in 4 m guanidine HCl in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) and passed over a cobalt column. The protein was immobilized onto the column and renatured before elution. For renaturation, the column was sequentially washed with 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.5 m guanidine HCl in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) and finally with 20 mm Tris buffer containing 150 mm NaCl (TBS; pH 8.0). Then the renatured soluble fractions were eluted with 1 m imidazole in TBS. Although a high concentration of imidazole was used for elution, anastellin was spread out over a large number of fractions and had to be concentrated with a Centricon-10 (Millipore) as described previously (19Bourdoulous S. Orend G. Mackenna D.A. Pasqualini R. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Anastellin (with a His6 tag) from the pQE-70 vector (20Klein R.M. Zheng M. Ambesi A. Van De Water L. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4663-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was also recloned into pET11b for expression in BL21(DE3) to improve solubility. However, the majority of anastellin was still insoluble and required renaturation. After renaturation, anastellin was quite stable in TBS and was able to induce sFN formation. Renatured anastellin also bound to a heparin-agarose column (Sigma) at the physiological salt concentration of 150 mm NaCl, as reported previously (25Mercurius K.O. Morla A.O. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mammalian Cell Expression Protein—The I1–9 (N-terminal 70-kDa domain) expression vector was constructed by modifying the pAIPFN-GFP vector (26Ohashi T. Kiehart D.P. Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2153-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). First a fragment containing I5–I10 (i.e. most of the FN and green fluorescent proteins) was removed from the vector by XbaI digestion to reduce vector size. Fragment I5–9 was PCR-amplified with a His6 tag, a stop codon and an XbaI site on the 3′ end and inserted back into the XbaI site on the vector. We call this vector pAI1–9. The His6 tag was added at the C terminus for purification purposes (QAQQ... YPSSGGGHHHHHHC, the FN sequence is underlined). To add a neomycin selection cassette, the EYFP-C1 vector (Clontech) was inserted into the KpnI site in the pAI1–9 expression vector (this vector, pAI1–9/Neo, does not express YFP, because of a modification). The I1–9 expression vector was transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) into Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells. The transfected cells were cultured with α-minimal essential medium (BioWhittaker) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone) in the presence of geneticin (G418, 0.75 mg/ml; Invitrogen). The highest expression clone was identified by Western blotting. The conditioned medium from this clone was collected, loaded onto a gelatin-agarose column (Sigma), and eluted with 6 m urea in TBS. The eluted fractions contained both I1–9 fragments and FN from the fetal calf serum and so were run over a cobalt-agarose column for further purification. The I1–9 fragments were eluted with 0.2 m imidazole in TBS. We typically obtained 0.1–0.2 mg of purified protein from 1 liter of culture medium. Pelleting Assay—The concentrations of purified proteins were estimated from their absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient of each protein calculated by the Protean computer program (DNAstar Inc.). The concentration of plasma FN (pFN) is stated for the monomer. Prior to the pelleting assay, proteins were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min to remove minor aggregates. The proteins of interest were mixed in a final volume of 25 μl with TBS containing 5 mm EDTA and incubated at room temperature for 16 h. EDTA was added because some metal ions, such as cobalt and copper, are able to precipitate a small fraction of FN (27Vartio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9433-9437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3T. Ohashi and H. P. Erickson, unpublished observation. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected. The pellets were rinsed with 100 μl of TBS and resuspended with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. SDS-PAGE was performed using standard procedures. Turbidity Assay—Turbidity measurements were performed with a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2401PC). Prior to the assay, the proteins were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min to remove minor aggregates. The proteins of interest were mixed in a final volume of 500 μl with TBS containing 5 mm EDTA. The samples were illuminated with 550-nm light, and data were collected at 20-s intervals for 1,800 s. Protease Assay—Proteins of interest were digested with thermolysin (10 μg/ml) in a final volume of 25 μl with TBS containing 10 mm CaCl2 at room temperature for 1 h. Prior to the digestion, the proteins were incubated with or without 40 μm anastellin at room temperature for 2 h. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Disulfide Mutations—To design an intrachain disulfide bond in III3, structural models of potential mutants were created by SWISS-MODEL (an automated protein homology modeling server) (28Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar). For this modeling, tenascin FN-III domain 3 (29Leahy D.J. Hendrickson W.A. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Science. 1992; 258: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and fibronectin FN-III domains 7–10 (30Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) were used as template structures. Two pairs of residues, residues Ser795 and Ser837 and residues Ala782 and Ser859, were selected for mutagenesis (Fig. 2), based on the proximity of modeled cysteine residues (i.e. the distance between sulfur atoms was estimated to be 2.0–2.5 Å). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the III1–5 expression vector using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Mutant proteins were purified as the wild type protein described above. Disulfide bond formation in these mutants was confirmed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE in which disulfide mutants migrated slightly faster than wild type. 5,5′-Dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) assays (31Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar, 32Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6534-6539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) also showed that there was no significant amount of free sulfhydryl under denaturing conditions, indicating that these disulfide bonds are completely formed. Cell Culture and Microscopy—FN-YFP transfected 3T3 cells were maintained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% calf serum (Hyclone) (33Ohashi T. Kiehart D.P. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell suspensions (0.2 ml; 8 × 105 cells/ml) were dropped onto 22-mm square cover glasses in 35-mm culture dishes and incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min to allow cells to settle. The medium was then changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum depleted of FN, with or without recombinant FN fragments. After cells were cultured for 16 h, the samples were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), washed, and mounted on slides. The samples were observed with a light microscope (Zeiss Axiophot) using a YFP filter set (41028, Chroma), and the images were captured with a cooled CCD camera (CoolSNAPHQ; Roper Scientific). Anastellin-binding Sites on FN and Stoichiometry of Anastellin Binding to FN and Recombinant Fragments—When anastellin was mixed with the conditioned media from cells secreting FN-YFP, the mixture became turbid and formed visible aggregates. Fluorescence microscopy showed that the aggregates contained FN-YFP and had some fibrillar structures (Fig. 3A). Most aggregates were large globular pellets as seen in Fig. 3 (A and B, upper right corners). The fibrillar substructure was best seen in thinner extensions at the edges. Differential interference contrast images frequently showed fibrillar structures even in the large globular aggregates (Fig. 3B). SDS-PAGE showed that the aggregates consisted primarily of FN and anastellin (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that anastellin specifically interacts with FN to form sFN and does not precipitate proteins in general. We next tested a range of concentrations of anastellin and found that 20–40 μm anastellin was needed to efficiently precipitate 1 μm purified pFN (Fig. 4). 40 μm anastellin was able to precipitate up to 4 μm purified pFN (data not shown). This suggests that the absolute concentration of anastellin rather than the ratio relative to FN is important. To determine the stoichiometry of anastellin to FN in the pellet, we scanned the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels from the pelleting assay along with ones containing FN and anastellin over a range of concentrations. We found an average of four anastellins/FN monomer (mean ± S.E. = 4.13 ± 0.12, n = 6) in the sFN pellet (Fig. 5). A recent study reported that anastellin co-precipitated with FN, in a ratio of 5–10:1 (34Akerman M.E. Pilch J. Peters D. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2040-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), similar to our results. In both cases the stoichiometry was estimated from scanning gels, which may not be the most accurate technique. However, we believe that our use of separate calibration curves for each protein should be accurate to within one subunit.FIGURE 5Estimation of stoichiometry of anastellin and FN molecules in sFN.A, increasing concentrations of pFN and anastellin used for standards are shown on the left and right. Plots of intensity (from the scanned gel) versus concentration are shown for pFN (B) and anastellin (C). The middle lanes in A show the pelleting with 20 μm anastellin and 0.5 or 1.0 μm FN. A ratio of ∼4:1, anastellin:FN monomer was estimated from the average of six samples. The small numbers above and below the lanes give the scanned intensity and estimated concentration of FN and anastellin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Several conditions were found to inhibit sFN formation: high salt (0.5 m NaCl), glycerol (40%), detergent (1% Triton X-100), and also high pH (CAPS buffer, pH 11.0). To resuspend sFN after it was formed, urea, guanidine HCl, or CAPS buffer (pH 11.0) was required, suggesting that the sFN aggregate is very stable. If left in TBS for several days, however, half of the aggregate would go back onto solution. To map the anastellin-binding sites on FN, recombinant FN fragments were tested to see whether they inhibited sFN formation. Selected fragments are shown in Fig. 6, and the results for all the fragments are summarized in TABLE ONE. I1–9 did not interfere with sFN formation, although it co-precipitated with sFN (approximately one I1–9/FN).

Interestingly, III1–12, III1–5, and III1–3 not only inhibited sFN formation but also replaced FN in the pellet with anastellin. III1–2 co-precipitated with sFN without interfering with sFN formation. FN fragments that contained domain III11 (III4–12, III7–14, and III10–12) also interfered with sFN aggregation. III7–10 and III12–14 had no effect on sFN formation, suggesting that anastellin interacts with III11. Domains III1, III2, III4–5, III4–7, and III13–15 did not inhibit sFN formation, nor did they co-precipitate with sFN. Surprisingly, FN fragments that contained III1–2 (III1–12, III1–5, III1–3, and also III1–2 itself) were able to aggregate with anastellin in the absence of FN (Fig. 6B), although fragments that also contained III3 (III1–12, III1–5, and III1–3) aggregated with anastellin more efficiently than III1–2 did. III1–2 did not inhibit III1–3 aggregation with anastellin, although a small fraction of III1–2 co-precipitated with it. Anastellin co-precipitated with III1–12 in a ratio of 4:1 (mean ± S.E. = 3.58 ± 0.16, n = 6), with III1–3 in a ratio of 3:1 (mean ± S.E. = 2.93 ± 0.15, n = 6), and with III1–2 in a ratio of 1:1 (mean ± S.E. = 1.22 ± 0.04, n = 6). The 4:1 stoichiometry of anastellin to III1–12 is the same as that for full-length FN. Kinetics of sFN Formation—The aggregation process was monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring the turbidity of the solution at 550 nm (Fig. 7). The kinetic profiles for FN, III1–3, and III1–2 aggregation with anastellin were very similar to each other, although the kinetic profiles at low concentrations of III1–2 showed a lag phase that may indicate nucleation (Fig. 7C). The assembly curves appear to comprise an initial rise that is approximately exponential, followed by a slower rise that may be linear or a slow exponential. Because III1–3 fragments were smaller than FN, higher III1–3 concentrations were required to detect turbidity. Although III1–3 and III1–2 were similar in size, the turbidity measurements for III1–2 required still higher concentrations than III1–3, consistent with the above observation that III1–2 may aggregate with anastellin less efficiently than III1–3. We attempted to fit the initial turbidity rise to a single exponential. The fit was not perfect but was reasonably good (Fig. 7, A–C). Remarkably, the reaction time for the fit was approximately the same, 500–700 s, for FN, III1–3 and III1–2, despite the different molecular structures and concentrations. Because anastellin was constant at 40 μm in all of these reactions, we next tested whether the kinetics were dependent on anastellin concentration. As seen in Fig. 7D, the kinetics for FN were the same when anastellin was increased from 40 to 160 μm. At lower concentrations of anastellin the kinetics are complicated by the lower rate and extent of reaction, and we did not investigate this range. We conclude that for (saturating) anastellin concentrations above 40 μm, the kinetics of assembly are determined by a first order reaction with a reaction time of ∼600 s. The possible nature of this reaction will be addressed under “Discussion.” Anastellin Alters Protease Sensitivity of FN-III Domains—We next used thermolysin to map anastellin-binding sites on FN. Limited thermolysin digestion of FN is well characterized and often used for generating FN fragments (24Johnson K.J. Sage H. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2078745581,"Retroviral Gag and Env glycoproteins (GPs) are expressed from distinct cellular areas and need to encounter to interact and assemble infectious particles. Retroviral particles may also incorporate GPs derived from other enveloped viruses via active or passive mechanisms, a process known as “pseudotyping.” To further understand the mechanisms of pseudotyping, we have investigated the capacity of murine leukemia virus (MLV) or lentivirus core particles to recruit GPs derived from different virus families: the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), the hemagglutinin from an influenza virus, the E1E2 glycoproteins of hepatitis C virus (HCV-E1E2), and the retroviral Env glycoproteins of MLV and RD114 cat endogenous virus. The parameters that influenced the incorporation of viral GPs onto retroviral core particles were (i) the intrinsic cell localization properties of both viral GP and retroviral core proteins, (ii) the ability of the viral GP to interact with the retroviral core, and (iii) the expression of the lentiviral Nef protein. Whereas the hemagglutinin and VSV-G glycoproteins were recruited by MLV and lentivirus core proteins at the cell surface, the HCV and MLV GPs were most likely recruited in late endosomes. In addition, whereas these glycoproteins could be passively incorporated on either retrovirus type, the MLV GP was also actively recruited by MLV core proteins, which, through interactions with the cytoplasmic tail of the latter GP, induced its localization to late endosomal vesicles. Finally, the expression of Nef proteins specifically enhanced the incorporation of the retroviral GPs by increasing their localization in late endosomes.

The Env GPs are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas Gag proteins are synthesized by ribosomes of the cytosol. The intracellular trafficking of Gag proteins and Env GPs modulates their ability to encounter each other. The viral assembly process has long been thought to occur exclusively at the plasma membrane. However, it is becoming clear that the retroviral assembly and budding sites depend on the type of producer cell. Indeed, in T lymphocytes, assembly of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and viral budding is thought to occur at the plasma membrane (1Gelderblom H.R.

During the assembly process, retroviral particles incorporate both viral and cellular proteins via active or passive mechanisms. The relative abundance of some cellular proteins in viral particles and in intracellular and plasma membranes has been compared. Some proteins are enriched in viral particles (or actively included), diluted (or excluded), or constant (or passively incorporated) (5Pelchen-Matthews A. Kramer B. Marsh M. J. Cell.

Passive incorporation of membrane proteins onto budding viral particles occurs in the absence of specific interactions with the viral core proteins, provided they are present at the budding site and are not sterically incompatible with the viral core. In contrast, active incorporation may require interactions between the Env GP and the viral Gag proteins. These interactions can be direct or indirect, via a cellular factor. Early evidence for Gag/Env interactions indicated that whereas Gag buds from any pole of polarized cells in the absence of Env GP, budding is relocated to the basolateral side upon co-expression with basolateral-located Env GP (13Lodge R.

Some motifs implicated in Gag/Env interactions have been identified for HIV-1 Env GP and reside in the α-helix 2 of the gp41 cytoplasmic tail (16Murakami T. Freed E.O. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3548-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Retroviral particles harboring GPs derived from heterologous enveloped viruses are called “pseudotypes” and are particularly useful to optimize gene transfer into specific cell types (for a review, see Ref. 21Sandrin V. Cosset F.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 100: 137-178Google Scholar). However, the co-expression of retroviral cores proteins and heterologous GPs does not necessarily lead to highly infectious particles, and restrictions in pseudotype formation have been reported (22Christodoulopoulos I. Cannon P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4129-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 23Lindemann D. Bock M. Schweizer M. Rethwilm A. J.

The Gag/GP combinations that lead to assembly of retroviral pseudotypes are rather unpredictable, in large part because of our insufficient knowledge of the mechanisms that dictate the assembly and budding of retroviral particles. To further understand the mechanisms of pseudotype formation, here we have investigated the recruitment by murine leukemia virus (MLV) or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) core particles of envelope glycoproteins derived from different virus families: the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), the hemagglutinin (HA) from an influenza virus-fowl plague virus (FPV-HA), the E1E2 glycoproteins of hepatitis C virus (HCV-E1E2), and the retroviral Env glycoproteins of MLV or of the RD114 cat endogenous virus. Through a combination of infection assays, biochemical methods, and confocal microscopy, we have determined some viral and cellular parameters that influenced the incorporation of viral GPs onto retroviral core particles. Our results point to distinct mechanisms operating during pseudotype formation: (i) the intrinsic cell localization properties of both viral GP and retroviral core proteins, (ii) the ability of the viral GP to interact with the retroviral core, and (iii) the expression of the lentiviral Nef protein. Cells—The 293T human embryo kidney (ATCC CRL-1573), the COS-7 African green monkey kidney (ATCC CRL-1651), the TE671 human rhabdomyosarcoma (ATCC CRL-8805), and the Huh-7 hepatocellular carcinoma (27Nakabayashi H.

Muriaux D. Darlix J.L. Cosset F.L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7153-7164Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). TE671 cells and Huh-7 cells were used as target cells for infection assays (19Sandrin V.

The phCMV-RD114 and phCMV-4070A expression vectors, expressing the RD114 and MLV virus envelope glycoproteins, were further modified to generate chimeric glycoproteins that harbor the cytoplasmic tails of the MLV and RD114 glycoproteins, respectively. The resulting chimeric glycoproteins were called RD/TRMLV (19Sandrin V. Muriaux D. Darlix J.L. Cosset F.L. J.

Briefly, 293T cells plated in 10-cm diameter plates were transfected by 8.1 μg of the pR4SA green fluorescent protein (GFP) vector construct (32Mangeot P.-E. Nègre D. Dubois B. Winter A.J.

Pseudotyped MLV-derived vectors were generated in a similar manner by DNA transfection of the pTG5349 MLV packaging construct (33Nègre D. Mangeot P. Duisit G. Blanchard S. Vidalain P. Leissner P.

A calcium-phosphate transfection kit (Clontech) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The medium (8 ml/plate) was replaced 16 h after transfection, and the supernatant was harvested 24 h later and filtered through 0.45-μm pore size membranes. COS-7 cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnosis). Infection Assays—To determine the infectious virus titers of the different pseudotyped vectors, serial dilutions of vector preparations were added to 2.5 × 105 target cells in the presence of 8 μg of Polybrene/ml for 4 h at 37°C. The medium was then replaced with normal culture medium for 72 h at 37 °C. The transduction efficiency, determined as the percentage of GFP-positive cells, was then measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, as previously described (25Sandrin V. Boson B. Salmon P. Gay W. Nègre D. LeGrand R. Trono D. Cosset F.-L. Blood. 2002; 100: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The infectious titers, provided as infectious units (i.u.)/ml, were calculated by using the formula: Titer = %inf × (2.5 × 105/100) × d, where “d” is the dilution factor of the viral supernatant and “%inf” is the percentage of GFP-positive cells as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using dilutions of the viral supernatant that transduce between 5 and 10% of GFP-positive cells. Antibodies—The RD114 SU goat antiserum (ViroMed Biosafety Labs) raised against the RD114 gp70 envelope surface protein (SU) and the RD114 TM (transmembrane protein) rabbit antiserum (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) were used, respectively, at 1/5,000 and 1/500 dilution for Western blotting. The gp70 Rausher leukemia virus goat antiserum (ViroMed Biosafety Labs) and the 42/114 rat monoclonal antibody (kind gift of A. Pinter) were used at 1/2,000 and 1/2 dilutions to detect the SU and TM proteins of MLV by Western blotting. The 83A25 rat monoclonal antibody (kind gift of L. Evans), directed against MLV SU, was used in immunofluorescence (IF) studies at 1/500. The FPV-HA Kp/Ro rabbit antiserum (kind gift of W. Garten) was used diluted at 1/500 to visualize the different forms of HA glycoprotein. The P5D4 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), directed against VSV-G, was used diluted 1/10,000 for Western blotting and 1/2,000 for IF experiments. The HCV-E2 glycoproteins were detected with the H52 mouse monoclonal antibody at 1/1,000 for Western blotting and with undiluted supernatants of the H53 hybridoma for IF studies (34Flint M. Maidens C. Loomis-Price L.D. Shotton C. Dubuisson J. Monk P. Higginbottom A. Levy S. McKeating J.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6235-6244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 2F12 mouse monoclonal antibody, directed against the SIV capsid (CA) protein (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program), was used at a 1/500 dilution for Western blotting. A mouse antiserum against the SIV matrix (MA) protein (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) was used at 1/1,000 dilution to visualize SIV Gag IF studies. The Rausher leukemia virus CA goat antiserum (ViroMed Biosafety Labs) and rabbit antiserum (kind gift of A. Rein) were both used at 1/10,000 dilution for Western blotting IF studies. Detection of Viral Glycoproteins—Forty hours post-transfection, virus producer cells were chilled on ice, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline2+ (PBS2+) (PBS, pH 8.0, supplemented with 0.7 mm CaCl2 and 0.25 mm MgSO4) and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml of sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. Biotinylation was stopped by incubating the cells with 1 m glycine in PBS2+ for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed with PBS, 0.1 m glycine, lysed with MacDougal buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 200 μm EGTA, 0.2 μm NaF, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini; Roche Diagnostic) and 0.1 m glycine, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min; 80% of the cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Pierce). The beads were then washed with MacDougal glycine buffer, resuspended in a denaturing buffer (1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% SDS), and boiled for 5 min. This fraction allowed the detection of cell surface-expressed proteins. The remaining 20% suspension was used to detect the total proteins in crude cell lysates. Purified virion samples were obtained by ultracentrifugation of viral supernatants through a 1.5-ml 20% sucrose cushion in a Beckman SW41 rotor (25,000 rpm, 2.5 h, 4 °C) and suspended in PBS. All samples were mixed 5/1 (v/v) in a loading buffer (375 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 6% SDS, 30% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.06% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and then run on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blotting was performed using standard procedures. The Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate was used to reveal proteins (Pierce). Membrane scanning was performed with the Storm 860 device and signal densities were calculated with the ImageQuant program (Amersham Biosciences). IF and Confocal Microscopy Imaging—FuGENE 6-transfected 293T or COS-7 cells were grown on 35-mm diameter coverglass dishes coated with d-lysine (Mattek Corp., Ashland, MA) or on uncoated 14-mm diameter glass coverslips, respectively. IF staining was performed 40 h post-transfection at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl, and permeabilized by 0.2% Triton X-100 for 8 min. The fixed cells were incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS, washed, and stained for 1 h with the corresponding fluorescent Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody (at 0.5 μg/ml) in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS. The cells were then washed several times with PBS and mounted on microscope slides with the antifading agent Prolong (Molecular Probes) prior to image acquisition. Images were acquired with an LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with an Axiovert 100M microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) and a 63 × 1.3 numerical aperture Apocromat objective. Alexa 488 was excited with an argon laser line at 488 nm, and emissions were collected with a band pass filter (BP505-550). Alexa 546 or 555 were excited, independently of Alexa 488, with an HeNe laser line at 543 nm, and emissions were collected with a long-pass filter (LP560). The secondary antibodies for Alexa were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Expression vectors encoding specific endosomal marker proteins, cellubrevin-GFP and TI-VAMP-GFP (35Alberts P. Galli T. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (kind gifts from T. Galli), were cotransfected with GP and Gag vectors. Retroviral Cores Are Efficiently Pseudotyped by Several Heterologous GPs—We studied the surface GP derived from several enveloped viruses (Fig. 1) for their ability to pseudotype MLV core particles: the VSV-G, FPV-HA, HCV-E1E2, and the retroviral Env glycoproteins from the amphotropic MLV or, as control, of the cat endogenous virus RD114 (19Sandrin V. Muriaux D. Darlix J.L. Cosset F.L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7153-7164Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The infectivity of pseudotyped viral particles harboring a GFP marker gene was determined on appropriate target cells, depending on the cell surface receptors required for cell entry by each vector pseudotype (25Sandrin V. Boson B. Salmon P. Gay W. Nègre D. LeGrand R. Trono D. Cosset F.-L. Blood. 2002; 100: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 28Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). As reported previously, the infectious titers of the pseudotyped vectors varied greatly, depending on the type of glycoprotein, and ranged between 1 × 104 and 1 × 107 i.u./ml as determined on the most permissive target cells (Fig. 2B). Such variations of the infectious titers could be dependent on several cellular factors such as receptor density, receptor binding, and cell entry route of the virions as well as the inherent pseudotyping capacity of the glycoproteins. However, following a screening of a wide array of cell lines and primary cells, we could not identify alternative cell types that were more susceptible to infection than the indicator cells displayed in Fig. 2 (data not shown and discussed in Refs. 25Sandrin V. Boson B. Salmon P. Gay W. Nègre D. LeGrand R. Trono D. Cosset F.-L. Blood. 2002; 100: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar and 28Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Finally, similar relative differences of infectivity were detected for retroviral pseudotypes produced from either 293T versus COS-7 cells, although the infectious titers were generally lower for viral particles assembled in the latter cells (data not shown and Fig. 2). Thus, the levels of infectivity reported here reflected the intrinsic functionality of either heterologous glycoprotein upon loading on MLV core particles. In a previous report (19Sandrin V. Muriaux D. Darlix J.L. Cosset F.L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7153-7164Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we found that the RD114 Env GP is not readily incorporated on lentiviral core particles, whereas a RD114 Env GP mutant harboring the cytoplasmic tail (cyt) of the MLV Env GP (RD/TRMLV chimera) restored incorporation and infectivity of pseudotyped lentiviral core particles (Fig. 2). Thus, to further investigate the potential role of the cyt of GPs in retroviral pseudotyping, we constructed a cytoplasmic tail mutant of the MLV Env GP harboring the cyt of the RD114 Env GP (MLV/TRRD Env chimera; Fig. 1). We then compared the capacity of all retroviral and non-retroviral GPs to pseudotype either MLV or SIV core particle (Fig. 2, A and B). We did not observe significant differences in the capacity of the GPs to pseudotype either retroviral core, except for the MLV/TRRD and RD114 Env glycoproteins. Indeed, whereas the MLV/TRRD and RD114 GPs could efficiently pseudotype MLV particles, reaching infectious titers over 2 × 106 i.u./ml, they were poorly assembled on SIV cores, resulting in titers of up to 3 × 104 i.u./ml with the latter core particles. This extended our previous results (19Sandrin V. Muriaux D. Darlix J.L. Cosset F.L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7153-7164Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that suggested that the cytoplasmic tail of the MLV Env GP promotes efficient glycoprotein incorporation on lentiviral core particles as compared with that of the RD114 Env GP. Again, the same relative differences of infectivity were detected between pseudotyped SIV viral particles produced in either 293T or COS-7 cells (data not shown and see Figs. 9 versus 2). Altogether, these data indicated that both the type of retroviral core and glycoprotein influenced pseudotype formation. Because the cyt modulates both intracellular localization (19Sandrin V.

Variable Incorporation of Pseudotyping GPs on Viral Particles—We then characterized the expression of Gag proteins and envelope GPs by Western blot analysis of purified virions, crude cell lysates, and biotinylated cell surfaces of virion-producer cells (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The analysis of the GP levels in these different compartments raised different interesting observations.TABLE 1Quantification of expression of the viral glycoproteins in producer cells and pseudotyped retrovirusesCore typeGP typeGPLaSignal intensities (arbitrary units, normalized to signals detected in cell lysates for each GP), acquired from scanning of Western blot membranes (e.g. Fig. 3) with a Storm 860 device, are displayed here for the indicated glycoproteins (co-expressed with SIV or MLV core proteins) as detected in total cell lysates (GPL), cell surface (GPS), and purified viral particles (GPV).

https://openalex.org/W2161537520,"Ischemia triggers an inflammatory response that precipitates cell death during reperfusion. Several studies have shown that tissues are protected by ischemic preconditioning (IP) consisting of 10 min of ischemia followed by 10 min of reperfusion just before ischemia. The molecular basis of this protective effect is poorly understood. We used cDNA arrays (20K) to compare global gene expression in liver biopsies from living human liver donors who underwent IP (n=7) or not (n=7) just before liver devascularization. Microarray data were analyzed using pairedt test with a type I error rate fixed at alpha = 2.5 10(6) (Bonferroni correction). We found that 60 genes were differentially expressed (36 over- and 24 underexpressed in preconditioning group). After IP, the most significantly overexpressed gene was IL-1Ra. This was confirmed by immunoblotting. Differentially expressed were genes involved in apoptosis (NOD2, ephrin-A1, and calpain) and in the carbohydrate metabolism. A significant increase in the amount of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in preconditioned livers but no change in the cleavage of procaspase-3, -8, and -9 was observed. We also observed an increase in the amount in the inducible nitric oxide synthase. Therefore, the benefits of IP may be associated with the overproduction of IL-1Ra, Bcl-2, and NO countering the proinflammatory and proapoptotic effects generated during ischemia-reperfusion."

Most interestingly, at least 12 h of pretreatment with ASA was prerequisite for promoting TRAIL-induced apoptosis and was related to down-regulation of BCL-2.

The apoptotic signal of TRAIL is transduced by binding to the death receptors TRAIL-R1 (DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (DR5), which are members of the tumor necrosis factor-α receptor superfamily. Both DR4 and DR5 contain a cytoplasmic death domain that is required for TRAIL receptor-induced apoptosis. TRAIL also binds to TRAIL-R3 (DcR1) and TRAIL-R4 (DcR2), which act as decoy receptors by inhibiting TRAIL signaling (4Pan G. Ni J. Wei Y.F. Yu G. Gentz R. Dixit V.M.

ASA is known to act by directly suppressing the cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-1 and COX-2), the ratelimiting enzyme catalyzing the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, thereby blocking the production of proinflammatory prostaglandins. ASA was also shown to be effective in the inhibition of ultraviolet radiation and carcinogen-induced tumor formations in animal models (24Bair W.B. II I. Hart N. Einspahr J. Liu G. Dong Z. Alberts D.

In this study, we examined whether ASA in combination with TRAIL increases TRAIL-induced apoptotic death in TRAIL-resistant human cancer cells. We hypothesized that pretreatment with ASA enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis by promoting the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. Our studies demonstrate that ASA augments TRAIL-induced apoptosis by down-regulating BCL-2 gene expression and by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential, which subsequently leads to an increase in caspase activation.

The samples were mixed thoroughly, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and examined under a light microscope. At least 300 cells were counted for each survival determination. Production of Recombinant TRAIL—A human TRAIL cDNA fragment (amino acids 114-281) obtained by RT-PCR was cloned into pET-23d (Novagen, Madison, WI) plasmid, and His-tagged TRAIL protein was purified using the QIAexpress protein purification system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). TUNEL Assay—For detection of apoptosis by the TUNEL method, cells were plated in slide chambers. After treatment, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol in PBS. Cells were washed once, permeabilized by incubating with 100 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate, and then washed twice in PBS. The TUNEL reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h with 0.3 nmol of fluorescein isothiocyante-12-dUTP, 3 nmol of dATP, 2 μl of CoCl2, 25 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, and TdT buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 140 mm sodium cacodylate) in a total reaction volume of 50 μl.

RNA Interference by siRNA of COX-2—To down-regulate the COX-2, COX-2 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. COX-2 siRNA was transfected into LNCaP cells and incubated for 36 h. The interference of COX-2 protein expression was confirmed by immunoblot using anti-COX-2 antibody (Cayman Chemical). Transfection—In order to generate Bcl-2 overexpressing LNCaP cells and CX-1 cells, cells were transfected with pcDNA3-Bcl-2 or pcDNA3-neo using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected for 3 weeks in growth medium containing 0.5 mg of G-418 (geneticin; Invitrogen) per ml. The clone expressing the highest level of Bcl-2 was used for this study. The expression level was determined by immunoblot analysis. Protein Extracts and PAGE—Cells were lysed with 1× Laemmli lysis buffer (2.4 m glycerol, 0.14 m Tris, pH 6.8, 0.21 m SDS, 0.3 mm bromphenol blue) and boiled for 10 min. Protein content was measured with BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). The samples were diluted with 1× lysis buffer containing 1.28 m β-mercaptoethanol, and equal amounts of protein were loaded on 8-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) using a Hoefer gel apparatus. Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS/Tween 20 (0.1%, v/v) at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody (diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions) for 2 h. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody. Immunoreactive protein was visualized by the chemiluminescence protocol (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Kinase Assay—For immunocomplex kinase assay, cells were lysed with 500 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protein inhibitor mixture solution (Sigma)). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKα or anti-IKKβ antibody. Immune complexes were washed twice with buffer B (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C and then incubated with 2 μg of purified GST-IκBα protein (Upstate Biotechnology) in the presence or absence of 1 mm ASA in a volume of 50 μl of a kinase buffer (100 μm ATP, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) for 30 min at 30 °C. Thereafter, the sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylation of GST-IκBα was analyzed by anti-phospho-IκBα antibody (Cell Signaling). Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Depolarization—The mitochondria-specific dye TMRM (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) was used to measure the mitochondrial potential. CX-1 cells were grown in 6-well plates and were pretreated with 1 mm aspirin in the presence or absence of TRAIL (200 ng/ml). After treatment, the cells were collected, washed in PBS, and resuspended in 500 μl of FASC buffer. Cells were incubated for 20 min with 200 nm TMRM (Molecular Probe) at 4 °C in the dark, washed in cold PBS twice, and then resuspended in 500 μl of PBS buffer. The cells were visualized by flow cytometry. Positive samples were stained with carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (mitochondrial membrane-depolarized inducer), and the surface markers were analyzed by an EPICS XL-MCL flow cytometer with a single argon laser at 488 nm (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Hialeah, FL). Isolation of Nuclear Proteins—Nuclear extracts were prepared by the modified procedure of Dignam et al. (28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acid. Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). Following treatment with ASA for 20 h, LNCaP cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated on ice for 15 min in hypotonic buffer A (10 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mmol/liter KCl, 0.1 mmol/liter EDTA, 0.1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1 mmol/liter DTT, 0.5 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.6% Nonidet P-40). Cells were vortexed gently for lysis, and the nuclei were separated from the cytosol by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 1 min. Nuclei were resuspended in buffer C (20 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.4 mol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1 mmol/liter DTT, and 0.5 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and shaken for 30 min at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, and protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). NF-κB in nuclear extracts was detected by Western blotting as described above. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—LNCaP cells were treated with various concentrations of ASA (0.01-1 mm) or 200 ng/ml TRAIL for 20 h, and nuclear extract was prepared as described above. The nuclear extract (10 μg of protein) was incubated with binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm ammonium sulfate, 1 mm DTT, 30 mm KCl, 0.2% Tween 20) and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 10 min on ice. Biotin-labeled probe NF-κB-specific oligonucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) was used. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The negative control consisted of free probe only. A competition control was set up by adding non-biotin-labeled cold probe to the reaction. The samples separated on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5% TBE for 50 min at 120 V. The samples were then transferred in 0.5% TBE onto a nylon membrane at 300 mA for 40 min. After transfer, the sample was fixed on the membrane by UV crosslinking. The membrane was first blocked with 1% blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science) at room temperature for 30 min. The biotin-labeled probe was then detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase diluted 1: 20,000 (Pierce). After washing three times and equilibrating in buffer, the membrane was overlaid with lumino/enhancer and substrate for 5 min. The image was acquired using a Kodak X-Omat 2000A (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Flow Cytometry—Cells were treated with ASA for the indicated time points with or without TRAIL. After washing, cells were blocked for 30 min with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were then incubated with 1 μg of primary antibodies to DR4 or DR5 (Alexis) in 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min followed by washing with PBS. Finally, cells were incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probe) for 30 min. After washing, the cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer. Matched isotype using control IgG antibodies was included. RT-PCR Analysis of Bcl-2 mRNA Levels—Total cellular RNA was extracted using the Trizol method (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was used with Novagen One-step RT-PCR kit (EMD Bioscience). The following sense and antisense primers were used at 0.5 μm for each: Bcl-2 primer, sense, 5′-CGACGACTTCTCCCGCCGCTACCGC-3, and antisense, 5′-CCGCATGCTGGGGCCGTACAGTTCC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primer, sense, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′, and antisense, 5′-ACCACAGTC-CATGCCATCAC-3′. The reaction conditions were 40 cycles at reverse transcription at 60 °C for 30 min, initial PCR activation at 94 °C for 2 min, denature at 94 °C for 1 min, anneal at 60 °C for 90 s, and final extension at 60 °C for 7 min. After amplification, the products were resolved by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed under ultraviolet light. Northern Blot Analysis—LNCaP cells were treated with either 200 ng/ml TRAIL or various concentrations of aspirin (0.01, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mm) for 20 h. For Northern blot hybridization, total RNAs (10 μg) isolated from the above-treated cells were fractionated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde-1.2% agarose gels, blotted onto Nytran Plus (Schleicher & Schuell), and hybridized with the 32P-labeled BCL-2 cDNA probe. The 448-bp BCL-2 cDNA probe was amplified by using PCR with primers 5′-CACCTGACCCTCCGCCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGTTGACTTCACTTGTGGCCCAG-3′ (reverse). ASA Promotes TRAIL-induced Cytotoxicity—To investigate the effect of ASA on TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity, human prostatic adenocarcinoma LNCaP cells were pretreated with ASA and treated with TRAIL in the presence of ASA. Fig. 1, A and B, shows that little or no cytotoxicity was observed with 1 mm ASA alone or 200 ng/ml TRAIL alone. However, pretreatment of ASA promoted TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity that was dependent upon concentrations of ASA (Fig. 1A) and TRAIL (Fig. 1B). Similar results were observed with TUNEL staining (Fig. 1C). Data from TUNEL assays show that apoptotic cell death occurred when LNCaP cells were pretreated with ASA followed by TRAIL. Effect of ASA on TRAIL-induced Apoptosis—Additional studies were designed to examine whether pretreatment with ASA followed by treatment with TRAIL causes PARP cleavage, the hallmark feature of apoptosis, in prostate cancer LNCaP and DU-145 cells and normal prostate YPEN cells. Fig. 2 shows that PARP (116 kDa) was cleaved yielding a characteristic 85-kDa fragment in the presence of TRAIL (50-200 ng/ml) and ASA (1-10 mm) in prostate cancer cells, but not in normal prostate cells. The cleavage of PARP was not observed by treatment with ASA alone. These results were similar to the observations of cytotoxicity (Fig. 1, A and B). Western blot analysis shows that procaspase-8 (55 kDa) was cleaved to the intermediates (41 and 43 kDa) by pretreatment with ASA and treatment with TRAIL in LNCaP and DU-145 cells. The combined treatment of TRAIL and ASA also resulted in an increase in caspase-9 activation as well as caspase-3 activation in LNCaP and DU-145 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). The precursor form of caspase-9 and -3 was cleaved to the active form of 37 and 17 kDa, respectively. ASA alone did not activate caspases. We extended our studies to investigate a time course and dose response on PARP cleavage. Fig. 3A shows that at least 12 h of pretreatment with ASA was required for PARP cleavage in the presence of TRAIL. Fig. 3, B and C, shows that a minimal amount of 10 ng/ml TRAIL or 0.01 mm ASA was required for PARP cleavage in the presence of 1 mm ASA or 200 ng/ml TRAIL, respectively, in LNCaP cells. We further investigated whether treatment with ASA is a prerequisite. Fig. 4 shows that combined treatment with TRAIL and ASA without pretreatment with ASA caused little or no cytotoxicity and PARP cleavage. Taken together, these results suggest that pretreatment with ASA for 12 h is essential for inducing apoptotic death in the presence of TRAIL.FIGURE 3Effect of pretreatment of acetylsalicylic acid on TRAIL-induced PARP cleavage in LNCaP cells. A, cells were pretreated with 1 mm ASA for various times (0-24 h) and treated with 200 ng/ml TRAIL for 4 h. B, cells were pretreated with 1 mm ASA for 20 h and treated with various concentrations of TRAIL (1-200 ng/ml) for 4 h. C, cells were treated with various concentrations of ASA (0.01-1 mm) for 20 h and treated with 200 ng/ml TRAIL for 4 h.

Akarasereenont P. Thiemermann C. Flower R.J. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 90: 11693-11697Crossref Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). To examine whether the promotive effect of ASA on TRAIL-induced apoptosis is mediated through inhibiting COX, LNCaP cells were pretreated with various NSAIDs and then treated with TRAIL. Unlike ASA, Fig. 5, A-C, shows that no significant cleavage of PARP was observed by treatment with various concentrations of sulindac sulfide (IC50 = 1.02 μm for COX-1 and IC50 = 10.43 μm for COX-2), NS-398 (a selective COX-2 inhibitor; IC50 = 4.81 μm for COX-1 and IC50 = 0.47 μm for COX-2), or indomethacin (a nonselective COX inhibitor; IC50 = 0.16 μm for COX-1 and IC50 = 0.46 μm for COX-2). To confirm our observations, cells were transfected with COX-2 siRNA or mock siRNA. Fig. 5D shows that the expression of COX-2 was effectively inhibited by siCOX-2. However, knock-down of COX-2 expression did not promote TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Nonetheless, pretreatment wit"

Many of the mutant proteins have increased turnover in vivo and decreased thermal stability. Here we show that purified, metal-free superoxide dismutases are degraded in vitro by purified 20 S proteasome in the absence of ATP and without ubiquitinylation, whereas their metal-bound counterparts are not. The rate of degradation by the proteasome varied among the mutants studied, and the rate correlated with the in vivo half-life. The monomeric forms of both mutant and wild-type superoxide dismutase are particularly susceptible to degradation by the proteasome. Exposure of hydrophobic regions as a consequence of decreased thermal stability may allow the proteasome to recognize these molecules as non-native.

Shneider N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1688-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Also known as Lou Gehrig disease after the famous baseball player, it causes progressive loss of motor function leading to death. The age at onset of symptoms varies, but is often in the 40s or later. The duration of the disease is also variable, with the more aggressive forms causing death in 1–2 years. Ninety to 95% of cases of ALS are “sporadic” or non-inherited, but 5–10% are familial. In most cases, inheritance is dominant so that one copy of the mutant gene is sufficient to cause the disease. About 20% of familial ALS cases are caused by mutations in copper-zinc containing superoxide dismutase (SOD1). SOD1 contains 153 residues, and over 100 different mutations are known to occur at 64 positions in the sequence (2Valentine J.S. Doucette P.A. Potter S.Z. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 563-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). 3Also see the ALS online data base (alsod1.iop.kcl.ac.uk/reports/mutations/index.cfm). Paralytic disease does not result from loss of superoxide dismutase function but from a toxic gain of function, the nature of which is not yet established (3Bruijn L.I. Miller T.M. Cleveland D.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). These key characteristics can be reproduced in rodent models, where expression of the ALS-associated mutant human SOD1 causes motor neuron disease, whereas expression of wild-type SOD1 does not (4Gurney M.E.

The in vitro susceptibility of SOD1 proteins to proteinase K does not correlate with in vivo half-life, so turnover cannot be explained by a general increase in susceptibility to proteases (9Ratovitski T.

The 26 S proteosome is composed of a 20 S core proteasome, capped at both ends by a 19 S complex that recognizes ubiquitinylated substrates and provides ATP-dependent unfolding of the substrate (11Hoffman L.

Thus, it has been thought that degradation of SOD1 proceeds through the ubiquitin-dependent 26 S proteosomal system. However, the 20 S proteasome can distinguish native from non-native proteins and degrade the latter without a requirement for ATP or ubiquitinylation (16Rivett A.J. Hare J.F. Arch. Biochem.

We therefore undertook a study to determine whether purified wild-type or ALS-associated mutant SOD1s could be degraded by purified 20 S proteasome. Materials—Substrates for fluorimetric assay of proteasome activities (AAF-AMC, AMC, LLE-AMC, and LSTR-AMC), ANSA, DTPA, and lactacystin were purchased from Sigma. Hepes and Tris buffer were from MP Biomedicals (Irvine, CA), and TCEP from Pierce. Sprague-Dawley rat livers were supplied by Harlan Bioproducts (Indianapolis, IN). Purification of the 20 S Proteasome—Livers were thawed at 4 °C and homogenized in 20 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.8, using a Potter-Elvehjem glass homogenizer with a Teflon pestle with 4 ml of buffer/g of liver. The homogenizer was rinsed with 20 ml of buffer for each liver, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °Ctoremove cell debris. The 20 S proteasome was then purified essentially as described (19Friguet B. Stadtman E.R. Szweda L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21639-21643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Conconi M. Szweda L.I. Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Friguet B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, the liver homogenate supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate cuts (35 and 60% saturation). The 60% ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.2, and dialyzed at 4 °C against the same buffer. The first ion-exchange chromatography step was performed on a TosoHaas DEAE-5PW column (Tosoh Bioscience, Montgomeryville, PA) with a Hewlett-Packard 1050 liquid chromatograph. Purification was achieved with two additional chromatographic steps: ion-exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) and gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences). The purified proteasome had the same pattern on SDS gels as published (Fig. 1 in Ref. 20Conconi M. Szweda L.I. Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Friguet B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), with some variation from preparation to preparation in the amount of associated hsp90. SOD1 Expression, Purification, and Demetallation—Human wild-type SOD1, “wild-type-like” mutants A4V, G37R and G93A, “metal binding region” mutants H80R, E133Δ, S134N, and the disulfide incompetent mutant C57S were expressed and purified as described (21Doucette P.A.

The purity of the protein was verified by SDS-PAGE and reverse phase HPLC. All preparations were also subjected to electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy, which confirmed that each had the expected mass, calculated with one disulfide linkage, except for C57S. “As isolated” or “metal-bound” SOD1 was protein that was not subjected to the following demetallation procedure. “Metal-free” or “apo” SOD1 were prepared by dialysis at low pH in the presence of EDTA as described (21Doucette P.A. Whitson L.J. Cao X. Schirf V. Demeler B. Valentine J.S. Hansen J.C. Hart P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54558-54566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). All glassware and equipment that came into contact with the apo-protein solutions were treated with a solution containing EDTA, and rinsed with metal-free water. Inductively coupled plasma, atomic emission mass spectrometry was performed using a Thermo Jarrel Ash IRIS 1000 ICP-AE instrument (Thermo Electron, Waltham, MA) to quantify metal ions that were present and to confirm that apo-SOD1 was metal-free (21Doucette P.A.

All apo-SOD1 proteins contained <0.05 equivalents of either copper and zinc per dimer. Disulfide Bond Formation and Scrambling—As described in the next section, we routinely assayed the susceptibility of SOD1 proteins to proteasomal degradation by the decrease in area of the peak of full-length SOD1 in the HPLC chromatogram. After the column eluate flows through the ultraviolet spectrophotometer, it passes to a mass spectrometer that determines the mass of the proteins or peptides. Human SOD1 has 4 cysteine residues at positions 6, 57, 111, and 146, but only Cys57 and Cys146 normally form an intrasubunit disulfide bond. In the course of these studies, we occasionally noted the appearance of peptides with masses that indicated the presence of an intramolecular disulfide bond between residues other than the normal Cys57–Cys146. For example, a peptide of measured mass 6,363.3 corresponds to residues 91–153 with a disulfide bond between Cys111 and Cys146. We investigated whether these non-native disulfide bonds were present in the SOD1 preparations or formed during the proteasome assay or in the mass spectrometer. We performed sequential alkylations of SOD1 preparations that were denatured in 6 m guanidine to fully expose Cys residues. The first alkylation was with iodoacetamide, thereby converting free cysteine residues to the carboxyamidomethyl derivative but without affecting cysteine residues in disulfide linkage. The disulfide bonds were then reduced with TCEP and the second alkylation was carried out with acrylamide, thereby converting the cysteine residues that had been in disulfide linkage to their propionamide derivatives. The alkylated proteins were cleaved by Lys-C, and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC-mass spectrometry as described (22Kang D.K. Jeong J. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Rouault T.A. Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14857-14864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The masses of the carboxyamidomethyl and propionamide derivatives differ by 14 mass units, thereby distinguishing those cysteines that were in disulfide linkage from those that were free thiols. When the analysis was applied to metallated SOD1s, Cys6 and Cys111 were almost exclusively in the thiol form, whereas Cys57 and Cys146 were in disulfide linkages, as expected. However, metal-free SOD1 proteins demonstrated a variable increase in disulfide content because of oxidation of Cys6 and Cys111, and there was some scrambling of disulfide linkages as mentioned above. Disulfide content appeared to increase with time of storage of the metal-free preparations at 4 °C. For example, metal-bound wild-type SOD1 had ∼94% of Cys57 and Cys146 in disulfide linkages, whereas ∼94% of Cys6 and Cys111 had free thiols. These distributions were unchanged in a freshly prepared metal-free sample. However, a sample that was stored for several months had only ∼55% of Cys6 and Cys111 in the thiol form. We therefore used only the freshest available preparations of the metal-free preparations in our studies. Proteasomal Degradation of SOD1—Unless otherwise stated, SOD1 wild-type and pathogenic mutants (30 μm) were incubated with 20 S proteasome isolated from rat liver (50 nm) at 37 °C for 120 min in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.8. When apoproteins were used, pipette tips were pre-washed in 10 mm DTPA, and 2.5 mm DTPA was added to the digestion mixture. The reaction was stopped by adding 1/10 volume of 1% trifluoroacetic acid, giving a pH of 3.5–4.0. Samples were then analyzed by reverse phase HPLC-mass spectrometry with an Agilent 1100 series as described (23Taggart C. Cervantes-Laurean D. Kim G. McElvaney N.G. Wehr N. Moss J. Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27258-27265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deconvolution of mass spectra and construction of extracted ion chromatograms were performed with version 10.01 of the Agilent Chemstation software. Control reactions were under the same conditions, but the trifluoroacetic acid was added at the beginning of the incubation. The fraction of digested SOD1 was determined from the loss of area under the intact SOD1 peak in the 210-nm chromatogram. The accuracy of this assay depends on the ability of the reverse phase column to separate the intact SOD1 from all products generated by the proteasome. In our experience, the column and HPLC system used are generally very good at doing this for proteins the size of SOD1. If any products did co-elute with the native SOD1, then the effect would be to underestimate the extent of degradation by the proteasome. We examined this possibility by mass spectrometric analysis of the peak containing intact SOD1. Deconvolution analysis of the mass spectrum revealed only the expected native mass, with one disulfide bond. If even a single residue were clipped from either the amino or carboxyl terminus, the resulting change in mass of either 131 or 146 mass units would readily be detected. If a single peptide bond were cleaved at any site from Cys57 to Cys146, no peptides would be released because of the disulfide tether. However, hydrolysis of the peptide bond would add a water molecule, and the resulting 18 mass unit increase would also readily be detected. Protein and Protease Assays—The bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) was used for determination of protein concentration using serum albumin as the standard protein. Chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolase activities of the 20 S proteasome were assayed with fluorogenic peptides AAF-MCA, LSTR-MCA, and LLE-MCA, respectively. A typical assay was carried out in a 96-well plate with 1–2 μg of proteasome in a total volume of 200 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, plus the appropriate peptide substrate. Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, fluorescence was measured with either a SpectraMax Gemini EM (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) or a CytoFluor series 4000 (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 360 and 460 nm. A standard curve of the fluorescence for the pure product was used to calculate the concentration of liberated aminomethylcoumarin product in the assays. When lactacystin was tested as a proteasome inhibitor, the proteasome and lactacystin were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before adding either a fluorogenic peptide or the G93A SOD1. Protein Surface Hydrophobicity—Surface hydrophobicity of the different SOD1 proteins was determined by incubating the proteins with ANSA at 37 °C as described (24Friguet B. Szweda L. Stadtman E.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly 25 μg of SOD1 was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.2. The change in fluorescence associated with the binding of ANSA to protein surface hydrophobic regions was monitored at 490 nm using 370 nm excitation with a QuantaMaster fluorometer (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ). The fluorescence intensity for ANSA binding to the metal-bound, wild-type SOD1 was taken as a point of reference. Results were expressed as the change in fluorescence intensity with respect to this reference. Apo-SOD1s Are Substrates for the 20 S Proteasome but Metal-bound Forms Are Not—The as isolated SOD1 proteins are metal loaded with copper and zinc, although with varying degrees of fidelity and completeness (25Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15923-15931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). These metal-bound SOD1 preparations were not substrates for the proteasome in our assay, but the apo forms were substrates with digestion proportional to the time of incubation after a lag phase of 15–30 min (Fig. 1). When most metal-bound SOD1 proteins are converted to their apo form, the protein remains a stable dimer. However, the stability of the apo dimer is decreased substantially relative to the metal-bound dimer, as shown in recent analytical unltracentrifugation studies (21Doucette P.A. Whitson L.J. Cao X. Schirf V. Demeler B. Valentine J.S. Hansen J.C. Hart P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54558-54566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This decrease in stability of the apo wild-type dimer was sufficient to allow some digestion by the proteasome, with ∼5% degraded during a 2-h incubation (Fig. 2). The 5 mutant SOD1 proteins associated with familial ALS had a wide variation in their susceptibility (Fig. 2). As noted in the Introduction, the intracellular half-life of some familial ALS-associated mutants is much shorter than that of wild-type SOD1, but this could not be explained by in vitro susceptibility to proteases such as proteinase K (5Borchelt D.R.

WT, wild-type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Determinants of Susceptibility to Degradation by the Proteasome— We first considered the possibility that the increased susceptibility observed for some of the mutant SOD1 proteins was due simply to the mutation creating a site that was readily attacked by the proteasome, but this was not the case. Some of the sites of cleavage could be confidently deduced from the deconvoluted masses of the product peptides, and many were the same for all of the SOD1 proteins, including wild-type (Fig. 3, TABLE ONE). Additional products were observed in some mutants. The time courses for the peptide products were determined from the areas of their extracted ion chromatograms and were very similar for all of the mutants (Fig. 4). Cleavage between Asp76 and Glu77 is one of the earliest sites cut, even though it is in the middle of the primary sequence.TABLE ONEPeptides produced by proteasomal cleavage of the metal-free A4V SOD1Elution timeaFrom Fig. 3.

We noted that many of the cleavage sites of SOD1 proteins are on the carboxyl side of aspartyl and glutamyl residues, indicating that the caspase-like subunits are responsible for the observed products, despite the relatively low specific activity of the caspase-like subunits with low molecular weight substrates (TABLE TWO).TABLE TWOActivity of the proteasome at different temperaturesCleavage typeaFor each cleavage type, the measured specific activity at 37 °C was set to 100%.

Activity was determined with fluorogenic substrates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Lactacystin is a highly specific inhibitor of the proteasome that binds covalently to the active site threonine of the β5 subunit, which has chymotryptic-like activity (26Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). Lactacystin thus causes a rapid and irreversible inhibition of chymotryptic-like activity. Tryptic-like activity is also irreversibly inhibited, albeit more slowly than the chymotryptic activity. Caspase-like activity is even more slowly inhibited, and the inhibition is reversible (26Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). Consistent with this behavior, when 50 μm lactacystin was tested with the low molecular weight fluorogenic substrates, it inhibited chymotryptic-like activity by 100%, tryptic-like by 93%, and caspase-like by 78%. When tested with G93A in a 90-min assay, degradation of SOD1 was inhibited by 63%. Although the catalytic β subunits of the proteasome require substrate sequences matching their specificity, the presence of those sequences does not determine whether a given protein molecule will be degraded by the proteasome. The molecular mechanisms controlling susceptibility are not well defined, but it is believed that the α regulatory subunits of the proteasome control access of proteins into the core of the proteasome (27Groll M. Huber R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 606-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome allows entry and will degrade protein molecules having exposed hydrophobic patches that are normally buried. For example, oxidatively damaged proteins typically have increased surface hydrophobicity, and the 20 S proteasome is the major pathway by which they are cleared from the cell, without a requirement for ubiquitinylation or ATP hydrolysis (18Shringarpure R. Grune T. Mehlhase J. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 311-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The fluorescent probe ANSA can detect changes in surface hydrophobicity (28Slavik J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 694: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 29Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S.

The three mutant SOD1s with greatest susceptibility to the proteasome showed substantial increase in their surface hydrophobicity (A4V, G37R, and G93A; Fig. 5). However, an increase in surface-exposed hydrophobic patches might not by itself allow entry of the globular SOD1 protein into the very restricted axial gate of the proteasome formed by the α subunits (12Groll M.

https://openalex.org/W2070644907,"Neurite outgrowth is a critical event in neuronal development, formation, and remodeling of synapses, response to injury, and regeneration. We examined the effects of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), a recently described blocker of the aggregation and neurotoxicity of the beta-amyloid peptide, on neurite elongation of central neurons. Morphometric analysis of rat embryo hippocampal and cortical neuronal cultures showed that neurite outgrowth was stimulated by DNP. This effect was accompanied by increases in the neuronal levels of the microtubule-associated protein tau and of cyclic adenosine 3',5' monophosphate (cAMP). DNP also promoted cAMP accumulation, increased tau level, neurite outgrowth, and neuronal differentiation in the mouse neuroblastoma cell line N2A. We show that DNP-induced differentiation requires activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The finding that DNP promotes neuritogenesis and neuronal differentiation suggests that, in addition to its anti-amyloidogenic actions, it may be a useful lead compound in the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting neurite dystrophy and synaptic dysfunction in neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2060059820,"To better understand the role of nutrition in regulating mammary gland development and lactation, we designed a novel stair-step compensatory nutrition regimen that is a unique combination of dietary energy restriction and realimentation (refeeding) phases; the basic concept of this regimen is to exploit the biological nature of the compensatory growth phenomenon in concert with one or more hormone-sensitive allometric phases of mammary development (i.e., peripuberty through gestation). Nutritionally induced compensatory growth during different developmental stages before first parturition positively affects mammary development and life-long lactation performance. This permanent enhancement of mammary gland growth and lactation potential strongly suggests a possible mechanistic link between nutritionally induced compensatory growth, epigenetic control of mammary gene expression, and metabolic imprinting. We hypothesize that compensatory-directed metabolic imprinting once set during late pregnancy prior to the first parturition persistently maintains and exerts its adaptive response on mammogenesis and galactopoiesis (i.e., maintenance and/or enhancement of milk secretion). The ability to influence heritable genes regulating milk synthesis may be used to improve the quality and quantity of milk (e.g., infant health, the secretion of certain immunoglobulins or growth factors) as well as the longevity of lactation."

Given that RUNX1 and RUNX1-ETO (Eight-Twenty-One) regulate the activity of the ARF promoter (22Linggi B. Muller-Tidow C. van de Locht L. Hu M. Nip J. Serve H. Berdel W.E. van der Reijden B.

Med. 2002; 8: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the IFP may also influence Arf expression and that this pathway would be operational in myeloid leukemogenesis. We demonstrated, in a bone marrow transplant (BMT) model, that the IFP is sufficient to induce AML and that this disease is held in check by Arf. Plasmids—The MSCV-IRES-GFP retroviral construct encoding the IFP was created by subcloning the entire coding region of this cDNA into the murine stem cell virus (MSCV) vector. MSCV-c-MyER was created by subcloning the c-MycER cDNA (23Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5741-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) into the MSCV-Puro vector. Viral Infection of Bone Marrow-derived Cells—Bone marrow was harvested from the femurs of wild type, Arf+/-, and Arf-/- mice (24Kamijo T. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Quelle D.E. Downing J.R. Ashmun R.A.

Cell. 1997; 91: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar) (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). 6–8-week-old donor mice were injected 4 days before with 140 mg 5′-fluorouracil (Acros)/kg of weight. Harvested cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Cambrex) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml interleukin-6, 10 ng/ml stem cell factor, and 3% conditioned medium from Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing interleukin-3. Viral supernatants were prepared using vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped retrovirus. 293-GP2 cells were transfected using Polyfect (Qiagen). Viral supernatants were pooled, centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium plus fetal calf serum with 5 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). Bone marrow cells were spin inoculated at 1800 × g for 1.5 h. In addition, these cells were cultured together with irradiated (30 gray) virus-producing BOSC23 cells prior to transplant. Approximately 5 × 105 to 1 × 106 cells, of which 10–30% were GFP+, were injected via the tail vein into lethally irradiated 6–8-week-old syngeneic recipient mice. Protein/DNA Analysis—DNA from the spleens of transplanted animals was extracted using the DNeasy tissue extraction kit (Qiagen). The DNA was digested to completion using the indicated restriction endonucleases and Southern blot analysis performed using probes to the retroviral vector (GFP) to determine the number of retroviral integration sites or a DNA fragment containing exon 1β of Arf. Immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described using antibodies directed to p19Arf (Abcam), CBFβ (25Lutterbach B. Hou Y. Durst K.L. Hiebert S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Flow Cytometry and Analysis of Leukemia—Standard three-color flow cytometry on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer was used for the majority of the analysis using fluorescently labeled antibodies directed to CD117 (c-Kit), CD11b (Mac-1), Ter119, B220, CD3, CD4, and CD8 (BD Biosciences) labeled with PE and Sca-1 and Gr-1 (Caltag) labeled with PE-Cy5. The analysis of lineage-negative (PE) and ScaI (PE-Cy5)-versus c-kit (APC)-positive cells was performed on a FACSAria flow cytometer. Histological analysis was performed on peripheral blood smears and on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Kaplan-Meier plots and the Log-Rank test were performed using the SPSS, version 8.0, statistical software package. The Student's t test were used to show that the differences in the size of spleens were significant at the 0.99 confidence level. Reporter Assays—NIH3T3 or HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated amount of plasmids encoding RUNX1, the IFP, or RUNX1(L175D), which cannot bind DNA, and 1 μg of the p14ARF promoter-reporter plasmid. A plasmid encoding a secreted form of alkaline phosphatase or Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control plasmid for transfection efficiency, empty pCMV5 was used as a vector control, and pBlueScript was used to balance the DNA content in the transfections. 40 h after transfection, cell lysates were assayed for firefly luciferase activity using the luciferase assay reagent (Promega), and secreted alkaline phosphatase activity in the culture medium was used to normalize transfection efficiency. The IFP Cooperates with Arf Heterozygosity to Induce Myeloid Leukemia—Previous murine models of the inv(16) have relied on expression of the IFP coupled with mutagenesis (18Castilla L.H. Garrett L.

However, only the use of chimeric mice created from embryonic stem cells containing MYH11 inserted into the CBFβ locus, coupled with either ENU or retroviral insertional mutagenesis, has yielded an acute myeloid leukemia (18Castilla L.H. Garrett L. Adya N. Orlic D. Dutra A. Anderson S. Owens J. Eckhaus M. Bodine D. Liu P.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 144-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 19Castilla L.H. Perrat P.

A. 2004; 101: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The observed cooperation between the IFP and deletion of the Arf/p16 locus was intriguing, given that Arf is a target for regulation by RUNX1 (22Linggi B. Muller-Tidow C. van de Locht L. Hu M. Nip J. Serve H. Berdel W.E. van der Reijden B. Quelle D.E. Rowley J.D. Cleveland J. Jansen J.H. Pandolfi P.P. Hiebert S.W. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Because this deletion is manifest in the germ line, the deletion of the Arf/p16 locus likely cooperates with the IFP, because the marrow of 6–8-week-old mice contains mutations that accumulate in the absence of these tumor suppressors. However, this model yielded ALL (20Yang Y. Wang W. Cleaves R. Zahurak M. Cheng L. Civin C.I. Friedman A.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2232-2235PubMed Google Scholar) rather than AML. This raised the possibility that the deletion of p16ink4a skewed the phenotype toward ALL. Therefore, we tested whether removal of only Arf might cooperate with the IFP to produce a better model of the inv(16). This presupposes that the IFP does not completely silence Arf expression and that deletion of Arf (but not Arf/p16) allows the accumulation of mutations that would accrue in the presence of the inv(16). To express the IFP in this model system, we subcloned the gene expressing the 611-amino-acid isoform of the inv(16) into a MSCV recombinant retrovirus vector containing an IRES linked to GFP and transduced bone marrow-derived stem cells and progenitors from wild type, Arf+/-, and Arf-/- littermates (Fig. 1). Bone marrow-derived cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing fetal calf serum supplemented with interleukin-3, interleukin-6, and stem cell factor. After spin inoculation, roughly 10–30% of the cells expressed GFP, and ∼1 million cells were used to reconstitute irradiated recipient mice. Control mice transplanted with wild type, Arf+/-,or Arf-/- bone marrow cells infected with the empty vector (MSCV-IRES-GFP) did not show signs of disease during the course of the study. Strikingly, within 12 weeks following adoptive transfer, more than half (5/9) of the mice transplanted with inv(16)-/- bone marrow showed signs of distress and had elevated white cell counts (Fig. 1, left panel, open boxes). Unexpectedly, by 15 weeks, 57% (8/14) of the mice reconstituted with the inv(16)+/Arf+/Arf+/- stem cells had also developed disease (Fig. 1, left panel, open diamonds), and by 18 weeks, all recipients expressing the IFP in either Arf-/- or Arf+/- bone marrow had succumbed to an apparent leukemia. Statistical analysis indicated no significant difference at the 95% confidence level when comparing the outcome of IFP expressed in bone marrow from Arf-/- or Arf+/- mice. By contrast, mice reconstituted with IFP-expressing bone marrow from wild type mice only showed increased white blood cell counts by 6–7 months post-transplant and with only ∼40% penetrance (4/9 in this experiment) (Fig. 1). Upon necropsy, all inv(16)+/Arf+/- and inv(16)+/Arf-/- mice showing outward signs of disease displayed splenomegaly (Fig. 2A), and some also had obvious hepatomegaly (data not shown). Histological sections of the spleens showed complete effacement of the splenic architecture, compared with normal spleen (Fig. 2, B and C), due to infiltration of the red pulp by immature hematopoietic cells. Histological sections of the liver demonstrated large periportal and perivascular infiltrates of similar immature hematopoietic cells as compared with normal liver (Fig. 2, D and E). Immunoblot analysis of splenic extracts from these diseased mice confirmed IFP expression at levels comparable with that expressed in the inv(16)-containing cell line ME-1 (Fig. 2F). In addition, transfer of inv(16)+/Arf+/- and inv(16)+/Arf-/- leukemic blasts into secondary recipients induced a similar disease with 100% penetrance (data not shown), suggesting that the IFP can cause the development of an aggressive leukemia and that this cooperates with haploinsufficiency or loss of Arf. inv(16)+/Arf-/- Leukemic Blasts Display Characteristics of an Immature Myelomonocytic AML—The peripheral blood of diseased inv(16)+/Arf+/- and inv(16)+/Arf-/- recipients contained high percentages (up to 80%) of immature white blood cells with large nuclei and a modest amount of blue cytoplasm (Fig. 3A), and touch preparations of the spleens indicated the presence of cells with a similar morphology (Fig. 3B). Many of these leukemic cells in the peripheral blood and spleen contained basophilic granules (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting a myeloid origin. In addition, we noted that the granules observed by Wright-Giemsa staining were similar to those observed in the abnormal eosinophils found in inv(16)-containing patients and also that some blasts contained cytoplasmic vacuoles (Fig. 3, A and B) that are typical of monocytic cells. To confirm the myeloid nature of the leukemic blasts, we immunophenotyped these cells in both the bone marrow and spleens by flow cytometry (Fig. 3C shows representative data from bone marrow). Regardless of their Arf status and consistent with their immature morphology, the GFP+IFP-expressing leukemic cells either lacked or displayed low expression of the lineage markers typical of more mature lymphocytes, erythroid, or myeloid cells (CD45/B220, Ter119, CD3, CD4, CD8, Gr-1, and Mac-1) (Fig. 3C,bottom left panel) and were positive for c-Kit but negative for Sca-1 (Fig. 3C,bottom right panel), which is characteristic of immature myeloid cells. The subset of GFP-positive cells that showed low expression of the lineage markers were likely slightly positive for Gr-1 and Mac-1, two myeloid lineage markers, because when these markers were used individually, they displayed low levels of staining of blasts from several mice (data not shown). The immunophenotype and granular morphology of IFP-expressing blasts were consistent with an acute myeloid leukemia. Given that there were a number of cells with some monocytic features (e.g. the presence of vacuoles) (Fig. 3, A and B), this appeared to be an AML that had some of the hallmarks of the human inv(16)-related myelomonocytic AML. Moreover, this phenotype matched the phenotype of the AML induced in chimeric mice derived from injection of embryonic stem cells containing a knock-in allele that recreates the inv(16) at the CBFβ locus coupled with ENU mutagenesis (18Castilla L.H. Garrett L. Adya N. Orlic D. Dutra A. Anderson S. Owens J. Eckhaus M. Bodine D. Liu P.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 144-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis using genomic DNA extracted from the enlarged spleens of mice expressing the IFP was used to determine whether the leukemia observed were clonal. In most cases, only 1–2 integrations were observed, suggesting that the AML induced by the IFP was indeed clonal in nature (Fig. 4 shows a representative example). Thus, this inv(16)-induced disease fulfills all of the characteristics outlined in the “Bethesda criteria” (26Kogan S.C. Ward J.M. Anver M.R. Berman J.J. Brayton C. Cardiff R.D. Carter J.S. de Coronado S. Downing J.R. Fredrickson T.N. Haines D.C. Harris A.W. Harris N.L. Hiai H. Jaffe E.S. MacLennan I.C. Pandolfi P.P. Pattengale P.K. Perkins A.S. Simpson R.M. Tuttle M.S. Wong J.F. Morse III, H.C. Blood. 2002; 100: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) to be deemed an acute myeloid leukemia. The inv(16) Is Sufficient to Induce AML—Among mice transplanted with IFP-expressing wild type bone marrow cells, roughly 40% developed disease but with a much extended latency compared with the IFP+/Arf+/- and IFP+/Arf-/- transplants (Fig. 1B). Similar to the disease induced by the IFP in Arf+/- or Arf-/- mice, the morphology of the leukemic blasts arising in wild type IFP+/Arf+-expressing bone marrow recipients suggested they were also immature myeloid cells (Fig. 5A). Some of these mice displayed no outward signs of disease and were sacrificed when increases in the percentages of GFP+ cells were detected in the peripheral blood. At this juncture, most of these mice had splenomegaly but only minimal liver infiltrates (data not shown) and a lower percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood. Also, one of these mice was found to contain leukemic blasts only following termination of the tumor watch. Immunophenotyping of the bone marrow of this mouse indicated the presence of blasts that were negative for Sca-1 with low expression of the panel of lineage markers (data not shown) but positive for c-Kit (56.7%) (Fig. 5B), consistent with the phenotype observed with the IFP+/Arf+/- and IFP+/Arf-/- transplants (Fig. 3). However, some of the GFP+ cells were still positive for GR-1+ (3.2%), Mac-1+ (13.8%), and GR-1+//Mac-1+ (8.7%) (Fig. 5B,lower right panel), suggesting that the disease in this animal was still evolving at the time of necropsy. IFP-induced AML Is Associated with Suppression of Arf Expression—The observation that bone marrow cells derived from IFP-expressing Arf+/- mice gave rise to AML, with only a slightly delayed onset versus AML arising in inv(16)+/Arf-/- recipients, suggested that the IFP effectively suppresses the expression of the remaining wild type allele in Arf+/- myeloid progenitors and/or that the IFP expression selected for the loss of the remaining wild type Arf allele in these leukemia cells. To address this issue, we performed Southern blot analysis to define loss of heterozygosity of Arf in these tumors. Although the exon 1β probe used to detect Arf would be expected to hybridize as well or better to the wild type fragment as compared with the mutant, it consistently yielded a weaker signal in these assays and in standard genotyping using tail DNA (Fig. 6A, see left panel and control lanes marked GFP). Therefore, in the majority of these cases (>80%), one wild type allele of Arf was retained (Fig. 6A shows examples of mice with the loss (lane 1) or the retention of the wild type Arf allele). Thus, the inv(16) cooperates with haploinsufficiency of Arf to induce AML. We also determined whether the remaining wild type allele in IFP+/Arf+/- blasts was expressed at the protein level. Immunoblot analysis of diseased spleens in transplanted mice showed that the protein was not detectable in the vast majority of the tumors and that only one out of nine tumors analyzed had detectable levels of Arf (Fig. 6B). Likewise, in the two tumors derived from IFP+/Arf+/+ bone marrow that could be analyzed, Arf was detectable but only at low levels (Fig. 6B,right panel), as compared with the levels present in murine erythroblastic leukemia cells or myeloid progenitor cells expressing c-Myc (Fig. 6B,bottom panel). Therefore, suppression of Arf expression is a common event in this mouse model of inv(16)-induced AML. Given the suppression of Arf expression in the leukemic samples, we tested whether the IFP also regulates the p14ARF promoter in vitro using two classical model systems that have been used extensively to test the function of RUNX1 and the inv(16). RUNX1 activates transcription in HeLa cells but represses transcription in NIH3T3 cells (27Lutterbach B. Westendorf J.J. Linggi B. Isaac S. Seto E. Hiebert S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 651-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 28Yang G. Khalaf W. van de Locht L. Jansen J.H. Gao M. Thompson M.A. van der Reijden B.A. Gutmann D.H. Delwel R. Clapp D.W. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5869-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the action of the IFP in both of these cell types. In HeLa cells, RUNX1 robustly activated ARF, and this activity was dependent on its ability to bind to DNA, as the L175D mutant that could not bind to DNA or to CBFβ (29Lenny N. Meyers S. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1761-1769PubMed Google Scholar) had no activity (Fig. 6C,top panels). When co-expressed with RUNX1(L175D), the IFP had little or no effect on ARF transcription (Fig. 6C). However, co-expression of the IFP and RUNX1 in HeLa cells impaired RUNX1-mediated activation (Fig. 6C). In NIH3T3 cells, RUNX1 repressed the ARF promoter as expected, which was also dependent on its ability to bind to DNA (Fig. 6C,lower panels). When the IFP was co-expressed with RUNX1, these factors cooperated to further repress the ARF promoter. However, co-expression of the IFP and RUNX1(L175D) had no effect on ARF transcription. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the RUNX1(L175D) mutant was expressed at similar levels as wild type RUNX1 (Fig. 6C,right panel). In this analysis, neither endogenous RUNX1 (Fig. 6C) nor CBFβ (data not shown) were detected. Although the experiment in HeLa cells does not distinguish whether the IFP acts at the ARF promoter or simply impairs the ability of RUNX1 to bind to DNA, the cooperation between the IFP and RUNX1 indicates that this repression requires the ability of RUNX1 to bind to DNA. The establishment of murine models of inv(16) AML is critical for understanding the molecular basis of how this chromosomal translocation sets the stage for the development of acute myeloid leukemia. The ARF tumor suppressor is repressed by the t(8;21) fusion protein, so we predicted that ARF would also be targeted by the IFP. Consistent with this possibility, we found that haploinsufficiency of Arf dramatically accelerated the course and penetrance of AML caused by the IFP and that Arf inactivation in this model does not occur through the deletion of the remaining wild type Arf allele, as seen in other scenarios (11Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 30Eischen C.M. Weber J.D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cleveland J.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2658-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), but rather through reducing the expression of Arf. Although the observed Arf haploinsufficiency may appear counterintuitive when it is a target for repression, similar effects are observed with other oncogenes that incompletely suppress the expression of tumor suppressors. For example, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 is transcriptionally repressed and/or degraded in response to expression of c-Myc (31O'Hagan R.C. Ohh M. David G. de Alboran I.M. Alt F.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. DePinho R.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2185-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 32Yang W. Shen J. Wu M. Arsura M. FitzGerald M. Suldan Z. Kim D.W. Hofmann C.S. Pianetti S.

Cell Res. 2003; 283: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), yet deletion of p27 cooperates with c-Myc expression in tumorigenesis (34Martins C.P. Berns A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3739-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The cooperation between Arf haploinsufficiency and expression of the IFP is consistent with incomplete transcriptional suppression of Arf by the IFP. Thus, removal of one allele of Arf cooperates with the IFP to reduce the threshold of Arf to functionally inactivate the tumor suppressive functions of Arf (Figs. 1 and 6). Alternatively, IFP expression may select for epigenetic silencing of Arf, although it is unclear how removal of one allele of Arf would stimulate this process. ARF expression is very low in normal cells but can be dramatically activated upon the expression of oncogenes such as c-Myc (11Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 30Eischen C.M. Weber J.D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cleveland J.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2658-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B). This makes the interpretation of the levels of Arf mRNA in leukemic samples difficult, where the nature of the cooperating oncogene(s) is largely unknown. The levels of ARF mRNA in inv(16)-containing samples did not appear to be as consistently low as in samples containing the t(8;21) (22Linggi B. Muller-Tidow C. van de Locht L. Hu M. Nip J. Serve H. Berdel W.E. van der Reijden B. Quelle D.E. Rowley J.D. Cleveland J. Jansen J.H. Pandolfi P.P. Hiebert S.W. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), but the examination of the expression of genes in AML samples is an end point analysis without control cells that phenotypically match the leukemic blasts. Nevertheless, the inv(16) samples displayed relatively low levels of ARF mRNA (22Linggi B. Muller-Tidow C. van de Locht L. Hu M. Nip J. Serve H. Berdel W.E. van der Reijden B. Quelle D.E. Rowley J.D. Cleveland J. Jansen J.H. Pandolfi P.P. Hiebert S.W. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Our studies have also established that the IFP is sufficient to stimulate AML, although with an extended latency that would allow for other mutations to accumulate (Fig. 1). In addition to a vector control (Fig. 1), we have also expressed CBFβ in a similar fashion. Enforced expression of CBFβ failed to cause leukemia, even though it was expressed in the majority of the hematopoietic cells. 4I. Moreno-Miralles and S. W. Hiebert, unpublished data. The action of the IFP contrasts with the loss-of-function phenotype of the conditional knock-out of Runx1 in adult hematopoietic stem cells, which failed to develop leukemia (35Ichikawa M. Asai T.

Thus, the inv(16) and other translocations involving RUNX1 generate gain-of-function mutations of the RUNX1·CBFβ transcription complex. Indeed, the t(8;21) and t(12;21) are dominant repressors of RUNX1 transcription targets (37Meyers S. Lenny N. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell.

Similarly, the IFP cooperates with RUNX1 to repress transcription (Fig. 6C), which is consistent with observations that the IFP associates with transcriptional co-repressors (40Durst K.L.

Biol. 2003; 23: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), that it is nuclear in inv(16)-containing leukemic blasts and ME-1 cells (derived from an inv(16)-patient sample), and that essentially all of the RUNX1 is found in the nucleus in ME-1 cells (41Liu P.P. Wijmenga C. Hajra A. Blake T.B. Kelley C.A. Adelstein R.S. Bagg A. Rector J. Cotelingam J. Willman C.L. Collins F.S.

Satake M. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 2000; 14: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Previous murine models of the inv(16) relied on the use of chimeric mice carrying a knock-in inv(16) allele coupled with either ENU or retroviral insertional mutagenesis to yield an AML that mimics the human disease (18Castilla L.H. Garrett L. Adya N. Orlic D. Dutra A. Anderson S. Owens J. Eckhaus M. Bodine D. Liu P.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 144-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 19Castilla L.H. Perrat P.

A. 2004; 101: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). By contrast, other retroviral models have yielded predominantly lymphoid disease (20Yang Y. Wang W. Cleaves R. Zahurak M. Cheng L. Civin C.I. Friedman A.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2232-2235PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have observed the induction of an AML that appears identical to that derived from the knock-in/mutagenesis model upon expression of only the IFP. One distinction in the current model is that, prior to the development of leukemia, we did not observe impaired myeloid differentiation, but similar to the knock-in model (18Castilla L.H. Garrett L. Adya N. Orlic D. Dutra A. Anderson S. Owens J. Eckhaus M. Bodine D. Liu P.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 144-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), there was impaired B-cell differentiation and a nearly complete block in T-cell development. 5H.-G. Kim and C. A. Klug, manuscript in preparation. This may be due to different levels of expression of the IFP, as the retroviral system produces only low levels of the fusion protein during these early stages. Therefore, both leukemogenic and developmental phenotypes may be dissected using this system. In addition, this model may provide a important scaffold to test novel therapeutics that are currently being developed to tackle inv(16)-induced AML.
