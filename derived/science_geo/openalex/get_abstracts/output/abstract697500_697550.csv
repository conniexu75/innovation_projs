https://openalex.org/W4287510022,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with a range of persistent symptoms impacting everyday functioning, known as post-COVID-19 condition or long COVID. We undertook a retrospective matched cohort study using a UK-based primary care database, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum, to determine symptoms that are associated with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond 12 weeks in non-hospitalized adults and the risk factors associated with developing persistent symptoms. We selected 486,149 adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1,944,580 propensity score-matched adults with no recorded evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Outcomes included 115 individual symptoms, as well as long COVID, defined as a composite outcome of 33 symptoms by the World Health Organization clinical case definition. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for the outcomes. A total of 62 symptoms were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection after 12 weeks. The largest aHRs were for anosmia (aHR 6.49, 95% CI 5.02-8.39), hair loss (3.99, 3.63-4.39), sneezing (2.77, 1.40-5.50), ejaculation difficulty (2.63, 1.61-4.28) and reduced libido (2.36, 1.61-3.47). Among the cohort of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, risk factors for long COVID included female sex, belonging to an ethnic minority, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, obesity and a wide range of comorbidities. The risk of developing long COVID was also found to be increased along a gradient of decreasing age. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a plethora of symptoms that are associated with a range of sociodemographic and clinical risk factors."

The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, was identified as a likely source of cases in early reports, but later this conclusion became controversial. We show here that the earliest known COVID-19 cases from December 2019, including those without reported direct links, were geographically centered on this market. We report that live SARS-CoV-2-susceptible mammals were sold at the market in late 2019 and that within the market, SARS-CoV-2-positive environmental samples were spatially associated with vendors selling live mammals. Although there is insufficient evidence to define upstream events, and exact circumstances remain obscure, our analyses indicate that the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 occurred through the live wildlife trade in China and show that the Huanan market was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4288035028,"Understanding the circumstances that lead to pandemics is important for their prevention. We analyzed the genomic diversity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We show that SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity before February 2020 likely comprised only two distinct viral lineages, denoted ""A"" and ""B."" Phylodynamic rooting methods, coupled with epidemic simulations, reveal that these lineages were the result of at least two separate cross-species transmission events into humans. The first zoonotic transmission likely involved lineage B viruses around 18 November 2019 (23 October to 8 December), and the separate introduction of lineage A likely occurred within weeks of this event. These findings indicate that it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 circulated widely in humans before November 2019 and define the narrow window between when SARS-CoV-2 first jumped into humans and when the first cases of COVID-19 were reported. As with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 emergence likely resulted from multiple zoonotic events."
https://openalex.org/W4287510152,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a range of symptoms in infected individuals, from mild respiratory illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome. A systematic understanding of host factors influencing viral infection is critical to elucidate SARS-CoV-2-host interactions and the progression of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR knockout and activation screens in human lung epithelial cells with endogenous expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We uncovered proviral and antiviral factors across highly interconnected host pathways, including clathrin transport, inflammatory signaling, cell-cycle regulation, and transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. We further identified mucins, a family of high molecular weight glycoproteins, as a prominent viral restriction network that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in murine models. These mucins also inhibit infection of diverse respiratory viruses. This functional landscape of SARS-CoV-2 host factors provides a physiologically relevant starting point for new host-directed therapeutics and highlights airway mucins as a host defense mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W4287510231,"Extending the success of cellular immunotherapies against blood cancers to the realm of solid tumors will require improved in vitro models that reveal therapeutic modes of action at the molecular level. Here we describe a system, called BEHAV3D, developed to study the dynamic interactions of immune cells and patient cancer organoids by means of imaging and transcriptomics. We apply BEHAV3D to live-track >150,000 engineered T cells cultured with patient-derived, solid-tumor organoids, identifying a 'super engager' behavioral cluster comprising T cells with potent serial killing capacity. Among other T cell concepts we also study cancer metabolome-sensing engineered T cells (TEGs) and detect behavior-specific gene signatures that include a group of 27 genes with no previously described T cell function that are expressed by super engager killer TEGs. We further show that type I interferon can prime resistant organoids for TEG-mediated killing. BEHAV3D is a promising tool for the characterization of behavioral-phenotypic heterogeneity of cellular immunotherapies and may support the optimization of personalized solid-tumor-targeting cell therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4287510533,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most prevalent form of early-onset dementia, affecting predominantly frontal and temporal cerebral lobes. Heterozygous mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) cause autosomal-dominant FTD (FTD-GRN), associated with TDP-43 inclusions, neuronal loss, axonal degeneration and gliosis, but FTD-GRN pathogenesis is largely unresolved. Here we report single-nucleus RNA sequencing of microglia, astrocytes and the neurovasculature from frontal, temporal and occipital cortical tissue from control and FTD-GRN brains. We show that fibroblast and mesenchymal cell numbers were enriched in FTD-GRN, and we identified disease-associated subtypes of astrocytes and endothelial cells. Expression of gene modules associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction was significantly enriched in FTD-GRN endothelial cells. The vasculature supportive function and capillary coverage by pericytes was reduced in FTD-GRN tissue, with increased and hypertrophic vascularization and an enrichment of perivascular T cells. Our results indicate a perturbed BBB and suggest that the neurovascular unit is severely affected in FTD-GRN."
https://openalex.org/W4287510055,"The a.c. Josephson effect predicted in 19621 and observed experimentally in 19632 as quantized ‘voltage steps’ (the Shapiro steps) from photon-assisted tunnelling of Cooper pairs is among the most fundamental phenomena of quantum mechanics and is vital for metrological quantum voltage standards. The physically dual effect, the a.c. coherent quantum phase slip (CQPS), photon-assisted tunnelling of magnetic fluxes through a superconducting nanowire, is envisaged to reveal itself as quantized ‘current steps’3,4. The basic physical significance of the a.c. CQPS is also complemented by practical importance in future current standards, a missing element for closing the quantum metrology triangle5,6. In 2012, the CQPS was demonstrated as superposition of magnetic flux quanta in superconducting nanowires 7. However, the direct flat current steps in superconductors, the only unavailable basic effect of superconductivity to date, was unattainable due to lack of appropriate materials and challenges in circuit engineering. Here we report the direct observation of the dual Shapiro steps in a superconducting nanowire. The sharp steps are clear up to 26 GHz frequency with current values 8.3 nA and limited by the present set-up bandwidth. The current steps were theoretically predicted in small Josephson junctions 30 years ago5. However, unavoidable broadening in Josephson junctions prevents their direct experimental observation8,9. We solve this problem by placing a thin NbN nanowire in an inductive environment. Direct observation of the physical dual a.c. Josephson effect, a series of quantized current steps in a superconducting nanowire, is reported and may offer a way to establish new metrological standards for currents."
https://openalex.org/W4287510521,"SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells requires specific host proteases; however, no successful in vivo applications of host protease inhibitors have yet been reported for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here we describe a chemically engineered nanosystem encapsulating CRISPR-Cas13d, developed to specifically target lung protease cathepsin L (Ctsl) messenger RNA to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice. We show that this nanosystem decreases lung Ctsl expression in normal mice efficiently, specifically and safely. We further show that this approach extends survival of mice lethally infected with SARS-CoV-2, correlating with decreased lung virus burden, reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and diminished severity of pulmonary interstitial inflammation. Postinfection treatment by this nanosystem dramatically lowers the lung virus burden and alleviates virus-induced pathological changes. Our results indicate that targeting lung protease mRNA by Cas13d nanosystem represents a unique strategy for controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection and demonstrate that CRISPR can be used as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection."

https://openalex.org/W4287509975,"Abstract Organisms presumably have mechanisms to monitor and physiologically adapt to changes in cellular Na + concentrations. Only a single bacterial protein has previously been demonstrated to selectively sense Na + and regulate gene expression. Here we report a riboswitch class, previously called the ‘DUF1646 motif’, whose members selectively sense Na + and regulate the expression of genes relevant to sodium biology. Many proteins encoded by Na + -riboswitch-regulated genes are annotated as metal ion transporters, whereas others are involved in mitigating osmotic stress or harnessing Na + gradients for ATP production. Na + riboswitches exhibit dissociation constants in the low mM range, and strongly reject all other alkali and alkaline earth ions. Likewise, only Na + triggers riboswitch-mediated transcription and gene expression changes. These findings reveal that some bacteria use Na + riboswitches to monitor, adjust and exploit Na + concentrations and gradients, and in some instances collaborate with c-di-AMP riboswitches to coordinate gene expression during osmotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W4287510580,"Mutations in Ras family proteins are implicated in 33% of human cancers, but direct pharmacological inhibition of Ras mutants remains challenging. As an alternative to direct inhibition, we screened for sensitivities in Ras-mutant cells and discovered 249C as a Ras-mutant selective cytotoxic agent with nanomolar potency against a spectrum of Ras-mutant cancers. 249C binds to vacuolar (V)-ATPase with nanomolar affinity and inhibits its activity, preventing lysosomal acidification and inhibiting autophagy and macropinocytosis pathways that several Ras-driven cancers rely on for survival. Unexpectedly, potency of 249C varies with the identity of the Ras driver mutation, with the highest potency for KRASG13D and G12V both in vitro and in vivo, highlighting a mutant-specific dependence on macropinocytosis and lysosomal pH. Indeed, 249C potently inhibits tumor growth without adverse side effects in mouse xenografts of KRAS-driven lung and colon cancers. A comparison of isogenic SW48 xenografts with different KRAS mutations confirmed that KRASG13D/+ (followed by G12V/+) mutations are especially sensitive to 249C treatment. These data establish proof-of-concept for targeting V-ATPase in cancers driven by specific KRAS mutations such as KRASG13D and G12V."
https://openalex.org/W4288037952,"The kinetics and the conversion features of two 3-component systems (A/B/N), based on the proposed new kinetic schemes of Mokbel and Mau et al, in which a visible LED is used to excite a copper complex to its excited triplet state (G*). The coupling of G* with iodonium salt and ethyl 4-(dimethylamino)benzoate (EDB) produces both free radical polymerization (FRP) of acrylates and the free radical promoted cationic polymerization (CP) of epoxides using various new copper complex as the initiator. Higher FRP and CP conversion can be achieved by co-additive of [B] and N, via the dual function of (i) regeneration [A], and (ii) generation of extra radicals. The interpenetrated polymer network (IPN) capable of initiating both FRP and CP in a blend of TMPTA and EPOX. The synergic effects due to CP include: (i) CP can increase viscosity limiting the diffusional oxygen replenishment; (ii) the cation also acts as a diluting agent for the IPN network, and (iii) the exothermic property of the CP. The catalytic cycle, synergic effects, and the oxygen inhibition are theoretically confirmed to support the experimental hypothesis. The measured results of Mokbel and Mau et al are well analyzed and matching the predicted features of our modeling."
https://openalex.org/W4287509974,"Abstract The use of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies is constrained because single antigen targets often do not provide sufficient selectivity to distinguish diseased from healthy tissues. We present HexElect ® , an approach to enhance the functional selectivity of therapeutic antibodies by making their activity dependent on clustering after binding to two different antigens expressed on the same target cell. lmmunoglobulin G (lgG)-mediated clustering of membrane receptors naturally occurs on cell surfaces to trigger complement- or cell-mediated effector functions or to initiate intracellular signaling. We engineer the Fc domains of two different lgG antibodies to suppress their individual homo-oligomerization while promoting their pairwise hetero-oligomerization after binding co-expressed antigens. We show that recruitment of complement component C1q to these hetero-oligomers leads to clustering-dependent activation of effector functions such as complement mediated killing of target cells or activation of cell surface receptors. HexElect allows selective antibody activity on target cells expressing unique, potentially unexplored combinations of surface antigens."
https://openalex.org/W4288039532,"High seed vigour ensures good quality seed and higher productivity. Early seedling growth parameters indicate seed vigour in rice. Seed vigour via physiological growth parameters is a complex trait controlled by many quantitative trait loci. A panel was prepared representing a population of 274 rice landraces by including genotypes from all the phenotypic groups of sixseedling stage physiological parameters including germination % for association mapping. Wide variations for the six studiedtraits were observed in the population. The population was classified into 3 genetic groups. Fixation indices indicated the presence of linkage disequilibrium in the population. The population was classified into subpopulations and each subpopulation showed correspondence with the 6 physiological traits. A total of 5 reported QTLs viz., qGP8.1 for germination % (GP); qSVII2.1, qSVII6.1 and qSVII6.2 for seed vigour index II (SVII), and qRSR11.1 for root-shoot ratio (RSR) were validated in this mapping population. In addition, 13 QTLs regulating the physiological parameters such as qSVI 11.1 for seed vigour index I; qSVI11.1 and qSVI12.1 for seed vigour index II; qRRG10.1, qRRG8.1, qRRG8.2, qRRG6.1 and qRRG4.1 for rate of root growth (RRG); qRSR2.1, qRSR3.1 and qRSR5.1 for root-shoot ratio (RSR) while qGP6.2 and qGP6.3 for germination %were identified. Additionally, co-localization or co-inheritance of QTLs, qGP8.1 and qSVI8.1 for GP and SVI-1; qGP6.2 and qRRG6.1 for GP and RRG, and qSVI11.1 and qRSR11.1 for SVI and RSR were detected. The QTLs identified in this study will be useful for improvement of seed vigour trait in rice."

Methods A cross-sectional study including 246 workers from primary health care services in Federal District, Brazil. Data collection took place from October to December 2019 through the Medical Office Survey on Patient Safety Culture (MOSPSC) application. Patient safety culture was considered positive when the score was above 60%. For comparisons between the categories of health care professionals’, the ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for composite percent positive scores, and Pearson’s chi-square or Fishers exact test for frequency and percentage of positive responses. Results The overall MOSPSC composite percent positive score was 49.9%. Among the 12 dimensions, only three showed a positive patient safety culture: Teamwork (73.1%), Organizational learning (62.9%), and Patient care tracking/follow-up (60.1%). The percentage of positive responses on overall quality assessment (78.1%) and overall patient safety assessment (78.0%) showed a positive evaluation. There was no significant difference in the composite percent positive score of overall MOSPSC (p = 0.135) and the percentage of positive responses on overall patient safety assessment (p = 0.156) between the categories of health care professionals. Overall quality assessment showed a significant difference between job roles (p &lt; 0.001), in which nursing /health care technicians showed a significantly lower score than other job roles. Conclusion The patient safety culture assessment showed a weakness in the patient safety in the PHC services. The MOSPSC and nine of its dimensions presented a negative safety culture assessment, regardless of the high scores in the overall patient safety and quality assessments."
https://openalex.org/W4288036758,"Diabetes may prevent kidney repair and sensitize the kidney to fibrosis or scar formation. To test this possibility, we examined renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in diabetic mouse models. Indeed, UUO induced significantly more renal fibrosis in both Akita and STZ-induced diabetic mice than in nondiabetic mice. The diabetic mice also had more apoptosis and interstitial macrophage infiltration during UUO. In vitro, hypoxia induced higher expression of the fibrosis marker protein fibronectin in high glucose-conditioned renal tubular cells than in normal glucose cells. Mechanistically, hypoxia induced significantly more hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α (HIF-1 α) in high glucose cells than in normal glucose cells. Inhibition of HIF-1 attenuated the expression of fibronectin induced by hypoxia in high-glucose cells. Consistently, UUO induced significantly higher HIF-1α expression along with fibrosis in diabetic mice kidneys than in nondiabetic kidneys. The increased expression of fibrosis induced by UUO in diabetic mice was diminished in proximal tubule-HIF-1α-knockout mice. Together, these results indicate that diabetes sensitizes kidney tissues and cells to fibrogenesis probably by enhancing HIF-1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W4287509805,"Adult survivors of childhood cancer have high rates of obesity, which, in combination with the cardiotoxic effects of specific cancer therapies, places them at high risk for cardiovascular morbidity. Here we show the contribution of genetic risk scores (GRSs) to increase prediction of those survivors of childhood cancer who are at risk for severe obesity (body mass index ≥40 kg m−2) as an adult. Among 2,548 individuals of European ancestry from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study who were 5-year survivors of childhood cancer, the GRS was found to be associated with 53-fold-higher odds of severe obesity. Addition of GRSs to risk prediction models based on cancer treatment exposures and lifestyle factors significantly improved model prediction (area under the curve increased from 0.68 to 0.75, resulting in the identification of 4.3-times more high-risk survivors), which was independently validated in 6,064 individuals from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Genetic predictors improve identification of patients who could benefit from heightened surveillance and interventions to mitigate the risk of severe obesity and associated cardio-metabolic complications. A report from large cohorts of adult survivors of childhood cancer demonstrates that genetic risk scores improve the risk prediction of developing severe obesity, providing opportunities for surveillance and mitigation interventions"
https://openalex.org/W4288035535,"High rates of non-prescription dispensing of antimicrobials have led to a significant increase in the antimicrobial overuse and misuse in Saudi Arabia (SA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial utilization following the enforcement of a new prescription-only antimicrobial dispensing policy in the community pharmacy setting in SA.Data were extracted from the IQVIA database between May 2017 and May 2019. The antimicrobial utilization rates, based on sales, defined daily dose in grams (DDD), DDD/1000 inhabitants/day (DID), and antimicrobial-claims for the pre-policy (May 2017 to April 2018) and post-policy (June 2018 to May 2019) periods were assessed.Overall antimicrobial utilization declined slightly (~9-10%) in the post-policy versus pre-policy period (sales, 31,334 versus 34,492 thousand units; DDD, 183,134 versus 202,936), with higher claims (~16%) after policy implementation. There was a sudden drop in the utilization rate immediately after policy enforcement; however, the values increased subsequently, closely matching the pre-policy values. Utilization patterns were similar in both periods; penicillin was the most used antimicrobial (sales: 11,648-14,700-thousand units; DDD: 71,038-91,227; DID: 2.88-3.78). For both periods, the highest dip in utilization was observed in July (sales: 1,027-1,559 thousand units; DDD: 6,194-9,399), while the highest spike was in March/October (sales: 3,346-3,884 thousand units; DDD: 22,329-19,453).Non-prescription antimicrobial utilization reduced minimally following policy implementation in the community pharmacies across SA. Effective implementation of prescription-only regulations is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W4288038915,"Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) comprises a pathophysiological spectrum of cardiovascular diseases related to atherosclerotic coronary plaque erosion. Oxidative stress and inflammation play pivotal roles in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, which affects circulatory proteins, including albumin and fibrinogen, thereby causing an imbalance in albumin to globulin and fibrinogen to albumin ratios. This study aimed to assess the effect of oxidative stress on circulatory proteins, correlate these parameters, and investigate their significance in patients with ACS. In this case-control study, the major blood proteins in patients with ACS and a control group were evaluated using standard methods. Out of 70 ACS cases, 75.7% had ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 18.6% had non-STEMI, and 5.7% had unstable angina. The mean cardiac troponin I level in patients was 12.42 ng/mL. The patients demonstrated a significantly reduced level of human serum albumin (HSA), 3.81 ± 0.99 g/dL, compared to controls, 5.33 ± 0.66 g/dL. The albumin to globulin ratio (AGR) was significantly depressed in patients while their mean fibrinogen level and the fibrinogen to albumin ratio (FAR) were significantly higher. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that albumin and fibrinogen were significantly associated with the risk of ACS, showing the potential of these parameters to be used for risk assessment of ACS. The ischemia modified albumin (IMA) and protein carbonyls were significantly higher in patients which showed significant positive correlations with FAR. Albumin, IMA and protein carbonyls were found to have high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for ACS. Overall, these circulatory and modified proteins in ACS patients, particularly lower HSA, AGR, and higher IMA and protein carbonyls may help assess risk."
https://openalex.org/W4288039938,"Background Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is pathogenically characterized with hyperandrogenism and metabolic alterations, which often result in ovarian changes and infertility in women of reproductive age. Epigenetic changes have been linked to the development of PCOS. However, the involvement of epigenetic regulator, histone deacetylase (HDAC) in PCOS-driven ovarian dysfunction is not clear. Howbeit, the present study hypothesized that acetate, an HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) would protect against ovarian dysfunction in experimentally induced PCOS. Materials and methods Female Wistar rats weighing 120–150 g were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6). The groups received vehicle, sodium acetate (200 mg/kg), letrozole (1 mg/kg) and letrozole with acetate by oral gavage respectively. The administrations were done daily for 21 days. Results The rat model of PCOS had increased body weight and ovarian weight, 1-hr postload glucose and plasma insulin, testosterone and LH/FSH ratio as well as reduced insulin sensitivity and plasma 17-β estradiol and sex hormone binding globulin. This model of PCOS in addition showed a significant increase in plasma and ovarian triglyceride, total cholesterol, TNF-α and HDAC, and ovarian malondialdehyde as well as a significant reduction in ovarian glutathione peroxidase/reduced glutathione and NrF2 with the histology of ovarian tissues showing disrupted morphology with significant increase in the number of degenerated follicles compared with control group. These alterations were however attenuated when treated with HDACi, acetate. Conclusion Altogether, the present results suggest that acetate protects ovarian function with evidence of normal growing follicles and enhanced circulating 17-β estradiol by inhibition of HDAC."

We sought to determine if delirium was associated with short-term adverse outcomes in a diverse cohort of younger and older patients with acute heart failure (AHF). We conducted a multi-center prospective cohort study that included adult emergency department patients with confirmed AHF. Delirium was ascertained using the Brief Confusion Assessment Method (bCAM). The primary outcome was a composite outcome of 30-day all-cause death, 30-day all-cause rehospitalization, and prolonged index hospital length of stay. Multivariable logistic regression was performed, adjusting for demographics, cognitive impairment without delirium, and HF risk factors. Older age (≥ 65 years old)*delirium interaction was also incorporated into the model. Odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were reported. A total of 1044 patients with AHF were enrolled; 617 AHF patients were &lt; 65 years old and 427 AHF patients were ≥ 65 years old, and 47 (7.6%) and 40 (9.4%) patients were delirious at enrollment, respectively. Delirium was significantly associated with the composite outcome (adjusted OR = 1.64, 95%CI: 1.02 to 2.64). The older age*delirium interaction p-value was 0.47. In conclusion, delirium was common in both younger and older patients with AHF and was associated with poorer short-term outcomes in both cohorts. Younger patients with acute heart failure should be included in future delirium outcome studies."

Yet, LGBTQ+ peoples' experiences are scant in reproductive health literature, particularly around pregnancy loss-a stigmatized and distressing pregnancy outcome. Informed by minority stress theory, this qualitative study aimed to explore the experiences of multi-level stigma and resilience among LGBTQ+ people in the context of conception, pregnancy, and loss. Seventeen semi-structured individual interviews (25-70 minutes) were conducted (2019) with a purposive sample of LGBTQ+ people in the United States (U.S.) who had experienced pregnancy loss (n = 14) or in an intimate partnership in which a pregnancy was lost (n = 3) in the last two years. Transcribed interviews were analyzed thematically. Participants described the profound sadness of pregnancy loss due to unique challenges of LGBTQ+ conception. Multiple types of stigma manifested at intrapersonal (e.g., anticipated sexual stigma upon disclosure), interpersonal (e.g., unsolicited advice about conception decisions), and structural levels (e.g., differential requirements to access conception compared to heterosexual/cisgender couples). Resilience was also seen individually (e.g., purposeful disclosure of conception, pregnancy, and loss), relationally (e.g., connecting with other LGBTQ+ community members), and collectively (e.g., creating/engaging in LGBTQ+-specific conception, pregnancy, and loss online spaces). LGBTQ+ people experience minority stressors of multi-level stigmatization throughout the pregnancy process, which limits their access to social support after experiencing pregnancy loss. However, individual, relational, and collective resilience strategies abound in response. Thus, minority stress theory can also be applied to recognize strengths-based and affirming approaches to reproductive healthcare for LGBTQ+ people."
https://openalex.org/W4288035219,"Tendon pathologies affect a large portion of people with diabetes. This high rate of tendon pain, injury, and disease appears to manifest independent of well-controlled HbA1c and fasting blood glucose. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are elevated in the serum of those with diabetes. In vitro, AGEs severely impact tendon fibroblast proliferation and mitochondrial function. However, the extent that AGEs impact the tendon cell transcriptome has not been evaluated.The purpose of this study was to investigate transcriptome-wide changes that occur to tendon-derived fibroblasts following treatment with AGEs. We propose to complete a descriptive approach to pathway profiling to broaden our mechanistic understanding of cell signaling events that may contribute to the development of tendon pathology.Rat Achilles tendon fibroblasts were treated with glycolaldehyde-derived AGEs (200μg/ml) for 48 hours in normal glucose (5.5mM) conditions. In addition, total RNA was isolated, and the PolyA+ library was sequenced.We demonstrate that tendon fibroblasts treated with 200μg/ml of AGEs differentially express 2,159 gene targets compared to fibroblasts treated with an equal amount of BSA-Control. Additionally, we report in a descriptive and ranked fashion 21 implicated cell-signaling pathways.Our findings suggest that AGEs disrupt the tendon fibroblast transcriptome on a large scale and that these pathways may contribute to the development and progression of diabetic tendinopathy. Specifically, pathways related to cell cycle progression and extracellular matrix remodeling were affected in our data set and may play a contributing role in the development of diabetic tendon complications."
https://openalex.org/W4288041933,"Clinical testing typically relies on invasive blood draws and biopsies. Alternative methods of sample collection are continually being developed to improve patient experience; swabbing the skin is one of the least invasive sampling methods possible. To show that skin swabs in combination with untargeted mass spectrometry (metabolomics) can be used for non-invasive monitoring of an oral drug, we report the kinetics and metabolism of diphenhydramine in healthy volunteers (n = 10) over the course of 24 hours in blood and three regions of the skin. Diphenhydramine and its metabolites were observed on the skin after peak plasma levels, varying by compound and skin location, and is an illustrative example of how systemically administered molecules can be detected on the skin surface. The observation of diphenhydramine directly from the skin supports the hypothesis that both parent drug and metabolites can be qualitatively measured from a simple non-invasive swab of the skin surface. The mechanism of the drug and metabolites pathway to the skin’s surface remains unknown."

Being female (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.21: 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.00, 3.82), being unmarried (AOR = 1.31; 95%CI: 0.32, 5.023), having history of chronic medical illness (AOR = 1.46; 95%CI: 1.07, 1.98), current seizure attack (AOR = 4.19; 95%CI: 1.36, 12.97), duration of care 6-11years (AOR = 1.80; 95%CI: 1.11, 7.58), duration of care > 11years (AOR = 6.90; 95%CI: 1.56, 30.49), moderate social support (AOR = 0.37; 95%CI: 0.13, 0.81), strong social support (AOR = 0.61; 95%CI: 0.22, 1.67) and currently use substance (AOR = 2.01;95%CI: 1.63, 6.46) were factors associated with depression. On the other hand, being unmarried (AOR = 1.47; 95%CI: 1.12, 1.93), current seizure attack (AOR = 1.81 with 95% CI = 1.28-2.54), able to read and write (AOR = 0.33; 95%CI: 0.14, 0.77), completed primary and secondary education (AOR = 0.54; 95%CI: 0.39, 0.76), current substance use (AOR = 1.466; 95%CI: 1.12, 1.93), being parent (AOR = 2.55; 95%CI: 1.31, 4.96), rural (AOR = 3.75; 95%CI: 1.40, 10.04) and grand mal type (AOR = 2.21; 95%CI: 1.68, 2.91) were factors associated with anxiety.In our study, approximately one in fifteen and more than one in ten caregivers had depression and anxiety respectively. The result of this study suggested that healthcare providers need to pay more attention to the psychological well-being of all caregivers of children and adolescents with epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W4288035798,"For the training of machine learning (ML) algorithms, correctly labeled ground truth data are inevitable. In this pilot study, we assessed the performance of graders with different backgrounds in the labeling of retinal fundus image quality.Color fundus photographs were labeled using a Python-based tool using four image categories: excellent (E), good (G), adequate (A) and insufficient for grading (I). We enrolled 8 subjects (4 with and 4 without medical background, groups M and NM, respectively) to whom a tutorial was presented on image quality requirements. We randomly selected 200 images from a pool of 18,145 expert-labeled images (50/E, 50/G, 50/A, 50/I). The performance of the grading was timed and the agreement was assessed. An additional grading round was performed with 14 labels for a more objective analysis.The median time (interquartile range) for the labeling task with 4 categories was 987.8 sec (418.6) for all graders and 872.9 sec (621.0) vs. 1019.8 sec (479.5) in the M vs. NM groups, respectively. Cohen's weighted kappa showed moderate agreement (0.564) when using four categories that increased to substantial (0.637) when using only three by merging the E and G groups. By the use of 14 labels, the weighted kappa values were 0.594 and 0.667 when assigning four or three categories, respectively.Image grading with a Python-based tool seems to be a simple yet possibly efficient solution for the labeling of fundus images according to image quality that does not necessarily require medical background. Such grading can be subject to variability but could still effectively serve the robust identification of images with insufficient quality. This emphasizes the opportunity for the democratization of ML-applications among persons with both medical and non-medical background. However, simplicity of the grading system is key to successful categorization."
https://openalex.org/W4288036439,"Pancreatic islet cell development is regulated by transcription factors (TFs) that mediate embryonic progenitor differentiation toward mature endocrine cells. Prior studies from our lab and others showed that the islet-enriched TF, Islet-1 (Isl1), interacts with the broadly-expressed transcriptional co-regulator, Ldb1, to regulate islet cell maturation and postnhyperatal function (by embryonic day (E)18.5). However, Ldb1 is expressed in the developing pancreas prior to Isl1 expression, notably in multipotent progenitor cells (MPCs) marked by Pdx1 and endocrine progenitors (EPs) expressing Neurogenin-3 (Ngn3). MPCs give rise to the endocrine and exocrine pancreas, while Ngn3+ EPs specify pancreatic islet endocrine cells. We hypothesized that Ldb1 is required for progenitor identity in MPC and EP populations during development to impact islet appearance and function. To test this, we generated a whole-pancreas Ldb1 knockout, termed Ldb1ΔPanc, and observed severe developmental and postnatal pancreas defects including disorganized progenitor pools, a significant reduction of Ngn3-expressing EPs, Pdx1HI β-cells, and early hormone+ cells. Ldb1ΔPanc neonates presented with severe hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, and drastically reduced hormone expression in islets, yet no change in total pancreas mass. This supports the endocrine-specific actions of Ldb1. Considering this, we also developed an endocrine-enriched model of Ldb1 loss, termed Ldb1ΔEndo. We observed similar dysglycemia in this model, as well as a loss of islet identity markers. Through in vitro and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that Ldb1 occupies key Pdx1 and Ngn3 promoter domains. Our findings provide insight into novel regulation of endocrine cell differentiation that may be vital toward improving cell-based diabetes therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4288040049,"A number of experiments were done to further our understanding of the substrate utilization in button mushroom crops (Agaricus bisporus). An analysis of the degradation of dry matter of the substrate during a crop cycle revealed that for pin formation the upper 1/3rd layer is used, for the production of flush one all layers are involved and for flush two mainly the lower 1/3 layer is used. A reduction in substrate depth leads to a decrease in yield/m2 but an apparent increase in yield per tonne of substrate with a lower mushroom quality. A short daily interruption of the connection between the casing soil with the substrate results in a delay of the first flush. Interruptions with only part of the substrate did not lead to delay in production. Daily interruption of the connection with all or only part of the substrate leads to a shift in yield from flush one to flush two but the total yield remains unchanged. The mycelial biomass in the substrate increases from filling up to pinning, has a steeper increase during flush one, and is levelling off during flush two, indicating that in the period of venting and up to/including flush one, enzymes are secreted by growing hyphae generating nutrients to feed a fixed amount of mushroom biomass for two flushes. A sidewise extension of the substrate (without casing soil, thus not producing mushrooms) showed that the substrate at a distance more than somewhere between 20-50 cm away from the casing soil does not contribute to feeding mushrooms in the first two flushes. The observations are discussed with respect to relevant previous research."
https://openalex.org/W4287509714,"The Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates cell renewal and repair and is closely associated with inflammation. Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) and astragaloside IV (AS-IV), which are the main active substances extracted from Radix Astragali, protect cells by regulating Wnt signaling in cells, exerting antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and antistress effects. However, the mechanisms by which APS and AS-IV interact with Wnt signaling to achieve their therapeutic effects in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) are not understood. In this study, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BMECs as an in vitro model of inflammation to investigate the effects of APS and AS-IV on Wnt signaling in inflamed BMECs. Drug concentrations were screened using the CCK-8 method, the effect on protein expression was analyzed using immunoblotting, the effect on inflammatory factors using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the effect on oxidative factors using enzyme labeling and flow cytometry. LPS activated the expression of inflammatory and oxidative factors in cells and inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling. APS and AS-IV antagonized the inhibitory effect of LPS, protecting BMECs. They inhibited the expression of the IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α inflammatory factors, and that of the MDA oxidative factor, and activated Wnt signaling in LPS-stimulated BMECs. Silencing of β-catenin abolished the protective effect of APS and AS-IV against LPS-stimulated BMECs. Thus, APS and AS-IV mediate protective effects in inflammatory BMECs model through activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt signaling pathway is one of the targets of the inhibitory effects of APS and AS-IV on inflammation."

However, recruitment for clinical trials remains a considerable challenge.Our overall aim was to quantify recruitment performance in industry-sponsored phase III clinical trials conducted globally during 2008-2019 with primary aim to examine development of overall clinical trial measures (number of trials completed, number of participants enrolled, trial duration in months) and key recruitment metrics (recruitment rate, number of sites, number of patients enrolled per site).The publicly available AACT database containing data on all trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov since 2008 was used. The analysis was completed during three time periods from 2008-2019 of 4 years each.Recruitment duration for industry-sponsored phase III clinical trials have increased significantly during the last 12 years from an average recruitment period of 13 months (IQR 7-23) in 2008-2011 to 18 months (IQR 11-28) in 2016-2019 (p = 0.0068). Further, phase III clinical trials have increased the number of registered sites per clinical trial by more than 30% during the last 12 years from a median number 43 sites (IQR 17-84) in 2012-2015 to 64 sites (IQR 30-118) in 2016-2019 (p = 0.025), and concurrently, the number of participants enrolled in clinical research has decreased significantly from 2012-2015 and 2016-2019 (p = 0.046). We believe that these findings indicate that recruitment for phase III clinical trials is less effective today compared to 12 years ago."
https://openalex.org/W4288035942,"Influenza co-infection with bacteria is a leading cause of influenza-related deaths and severe respiratory infections, especially among high-risk groups like cancer patients undergoing treatment. However, acute respiratory infection (ARI)-like symptoms developed by upper-torso cancer (UTC) patients receiving radiotherapy are considered as side-effects of the radiation. Hence influenza and bacterial pathogens implicated in ARI are not investigated.This prospective cohort study examined 85 in-patients with upper-torso cancers undergoing radiotherapy at the National Radiotherapy, Oncology and Nuclear Medicine Centre (NRONMC) of Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH) in Accra, Ghana. Eligible patients who consented were recruited into the study from September 2018 to April 2019. Influenza viruses A and B in addition to the following bacteria species Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Staphylococcus aureus were detected from oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected at three different time points. Presence of respiratory pathogens were investigated by influenza virus isolation in cell culture, bacterial culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next generation sequencing (NGS) assays.Of the 85 eligible participants enrolled into the study, 87% were females. Participants were 17 to 77 years old, with a median age of 49 years. Most of the participants (88%) enrolled had at least one pathogen present. The most prevalent pathogen was N. meningitidis (63.4%), followed by H. influenzae (48.8%), Influenza viruses A and B (32.9%), S. pneumoniae (32.9%) and S. aureus (12.2%). Approximately, 65% of these participants developed ARI-like symptoms. Participants with previous episodes of ARI, did not live alone, HNC and total radiation less than 50 Gy were significantly associated with ARI. All treatment forms were also significantly associated with ARI.Data generated from the study suggests that ARI-like symptoms observed among UTC patients receiving radiotherapy in Ghana, could be due to influenza and bacterial single and co-infections in addition to risk factors and not solely the side-effects of radiation as perceived. These findings will be prime importance for diagnosis, prevention, treatment and control for cancer patients who present with such episodes during treatment."

In recent decades, this database has been used for predicting the outbreak of epidemics and pandemics in different regions of the world. The present study aimed to evaluate Iranian users' COVID-19-related online search behavior.This longitudinal study was conducted in 2021. The data of Iranian users' COVID-19-related online search behavior (trend) were collected from the GT website, and the epidemiological data of the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran from 16 February 2020 to 2 January 2021 were sourced from the Iranian ministry of health and medical education, as well as the World Health Organization. The data were analyzed in SPSS using descriptive and inferential statistics.All the COVID-19-related search terms in Iran gained their highest popularity value (relative search volume = 100) in the first 8 weeks of the pandemic, and then this value assumed a decreasing trend over time. Based on factor analysis, relative search volume (RSV) of factor 1 terms (related to corona [in Persian] and corona) have a low significance relationship with COVID-19 epidemiological data in one-, two-, and three-week time lags. Although, RSV of factor 2 terms (related to COVID [in Persian], COVID-19, and coronavirus) correlated with the total weekly number of COVID-19 cases in mentioned time lags.COVID-19-related search terms were popular among Iranian users at the beginning of the pandemic. The online search queries and the key terms searched by Iranian users varied during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study provides evidence in favor of the adoption of GT as an epidemiological surveillance tool but, it is necessary to consider that mass media and other confounders can significantly influence RSVs."
https://openalex.org/W4288038658,"Increasing attention is being paid to the welfare of decapod crustaceans. Legislation exists for their humane slaughter in several countries and this is being debated in others. Electrical stunning may have potential for humane slaughter of crustaceans in some circumstances, although scientific data on the effectiveness of electrical stunning when applied to various species are limited. Assessment criteria for effective stunning have so far been based mainly on behavioural assessments, but these do not always reflect neural insensibility. In this study direct recordings of neural activity, both centrally and peripherally, have been used to provide more direct measures of the state of sensibility. We have also examined whether electrical stunning acts as a physiological stressor, using measures of haemolymph L-lactate. Experiments were performed on a commercially important decapod species, the brown crab Cancer pagurus L. Spontaneous activity within the CNS was arrested by electrical stunning, which is an indication of loss of sensibility. There were also specific effects on the peripheral nervous system, with loss of responsiveness to sensory stimulation, rendering the animals unresponsive to external stimuli, and a failure of motor activation. All these effects were apparent immediately after a 10s stun, and persisted for as long as tested (4h) indicating that the animals were also killed by the procedure. No autotomy of limbs occurred. Haemolymph L-lactate was found to be no greater following electrical stunning than after handling and sampling alone, and both were significantly lower than values reached in a range of environmental and commercial situations. For all these reasons we find that electrical stunning may meet criteria for humane slaughter of C . pagurus ."

This study, therefore, explored how caring affects the physical health of family caregivers of prostate cancer patients.The study adopted a descriptive phenomenological method. Twelve participants were recruited using the purposive sampling technique. A semi-structured face to face, in-depth interviews were conducted with family caregivers of patients living with prostate cancer. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the data were analysed using Colaizzi's phenomenological approach.The family caregiver's experience with the physical impact associated with caregiving uncovered two significant themes with six sub-themes. ""Rest and Sleep"" emerged as the first central theme, with sleeplessness, fatigue, pain, and worsening pre-existing conditions as the sub-themes. The second main theme was 'Nutrition' with altered eating patterns and weight loss emerging as sub-themes.The study suggests that family caregivers of patients treated for prostate cancer may struggle with physical consequences associated with the caregiving role, which impacts their physical health. It is of great importance, especially for nurses, to come up with measures to minimise these adverse physical effects on the family caregivers through formal education programmes and training on how to care for these patients at home."

Hill tribe people are vulnerable to prediabetes due to their unique cultural cooking methods and their hard work on farms, as well as their low economic status and educational levels. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of prediabetes among hill tribe people in Thailand and identify the related factors.This cross-sectional study included participants who belong to one of the six main hill tribes: Akah, Lahu, Hmong, Yao, Karen, and Lisu. The study was conducted in 30 hill tribe villages in Chiang Rai Province, Thailand. A validated questionnaire was administered, and 5-mL blood specimens were collected. Data were collected between November 2019 and March 2020. Logistic regression was used to determine the associations between independent variables and prediabetes.A total of 1,406 participants were recruited for the study; 67.8% were women, 77.2% were between 40 and 59 years old, and 82.9% were married. The majority worked in the agricultural sector (57.2%), had an annual income ≤ 50,000 baht (67.5%), and had never attended school (69.3%). The prevalence of prediabetes was 11.2%. After controlling for age and sex, five factors were found to be associated with prediabetes. Members of the Akha and Lisu tribes had 2.03 (95% CI = 1.03-3.99) and 2.20 (95% CI = 1.10-4.42) times higher odds of having prediabetes than Karen tribe members, respectively. Those with hypertension (HT) had 1.47 (95% CI = 1.03-2.08) times higher odds of having prediabetes than those with normal blood pressure. Those with a normal total cholesterol level had 2.43 (95% CI = 1.65-3.58) times higher odds of having prediabetes than those with a high total cholesterol level. Those with a high triglyceride level had 1.64 (95% CI = 1.16-2.32) times higher odds of having prediabetes than those with a normal triglyceride level. Those with a high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level had 1.96 (95% CI = 1.30-2.96) times higher odds of having prediabetes than those with a normal LDL-C level.Appropriate dietary guidelines and exercise should be promoted among hill tribe people between 30 and 59 years old to reduce the probability of developing prediabetes."

It is found that: i) As the copolymer concentration varies from 0.05 to 0.15, increasing the copolymer enrichment at the center of the interface enlarges the interface width ω and reduces the interfacial tension. However, as the concentration of the sequence copolymers further increases to 0.2, because the interface has formed micelles and the micellization could lower the efficiency of copolymers as a compatibilizer, the interfacial tension exhibits a slightly increase; ii) elevating the copolymer chain length, the copolymer volumes vary from a cylinder shape to a pancake shape. The blends of the copolymer with chain length N cp = 24 exhibit a wider interfacial width w and a lower interfacial tension γ , which indicates that the sequenced copolymer N cp = 24 exhibits a better performance as the compatibilizers. This study illustrates the correlations between the reduction in interfacial tension produced by the sequence copolymers and their molecular parameters, which guide a rational design of an efficient compatibilizer."

The results show that heat stress decreases the hair follicle density of Rex rabbits, and the diet methionine addition significantly increases the hair follicle density of heat-stressed Rabbits (p < .05). Heat stress increased serum HSP70 concentration and skin HSP70 gene expression, 0.15%-0.3% methionine but not 0.45% addition alleviated the effect of heat stress. Dietary 0.15% methionine addition significantly increases the gene expression of Wnt10b, β-catenin, LEF, FZD4, LRP6, Shh, HGF, EGF, and Noggin in heat-stressed Rex rabbits and observably decreases the gene expression of BMP2/4 and TGFb. There was no significant effect of methionine on the expression of IGF1 and FGF5/7 gene expression. In conclusion, methionine maybe promotes hair follicle development via TGFβ-BMP/Shh-Noggin, Wnt10b/β-catenin, EGF, and HGF signaling pathways in heat-stressed rabbits."

In total, 1,040 Japanese adults aged 20-89 years were enrolled in this study. Influenza infection status was determined by participants' responses to a self-administered questionnaire. The visceral fat area (VFA) was measured using a bioimpedance-type visceral fat meter. Participants were classified into four groups using the following cut-off points: VFA < 100 cm2 was set as the reference category according to the Japanese criteria, 100 ≤ VFA < 150 cm2, 150 ≤ VFA < 200 cm2, and 200 cm2 ≤ VFA. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between VFA and influenza infection.In total, 119 participants had influenza infections in the past year. In the multivariate adjusted model, a higher VFA was significantly associated with increased influenza infection; the adjusted odds ratio for 200 cm2 ≤ VFA was 5.03 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-23.6], that for 150 ≤ VFA < 200 cm2 was 1.97 (95% CI: 0.71-5.45), and that for 100 ≤ VFA < 150 cm2 was 1.62 (95% CI: 0.84-3.12), compared with that for VFA < 100 cm2 (p for trend = 0.049). These findings were confirmed in the same cohort the following year.Our results suggest that visceral fat accumulation is associated with influenza infection. Large-scale prospective studies using diagnostic information for influenza infection are required to confirm this association."
https://openalex.org/W4288039199,"Guertu virus (GTV), a newly discovered member of the genus Banyangvirus in the family Phenuiviridae , poses a potential health threat to humans and animals. The viral glycoprotein (GP) binds to host cell receptors to induce a neutralizing immune response in the host. Therefore, identification of the B-cell epitopes (BCEs) in the immunodominant region of the GTV Gc protein is important for the elucidation of the virus–host cell interactions and the development of GTV epitope assays and vaccines. In this study, an improved overlapping biosynthetic peptide method and rabbit anti-GTV Gc polyclonal antibodies were used for fine mapping of the minimal motifs of linear BCEs of the GTV Gc protein. Thirteen BCE motifs were identified from eleven positive 16mer-peptides, namely EGc1 ( 19 KVCATTGRA 27 ), EGc2 ( 58 KKINLKCKK 66 ), EGc3 ( 68 SSYYVPDA 75 ), EGc4 ( 75 ARSRCTSVRR 84 ), EGc5 ( 79 CTSVRRCRWA 88 ), EGc6 ( 90 DCQSGCPS 97 ), EGc7 ( 96 PSHFTSNS 103 ), EGc8 ( 115 AGLGFSG 121 ), EGc9 ( 148 ENPHGVI 154 ), EGc10 ( 179 KVFHPMS 185 ), EGc11 ( 230 QAGMGVVG 237 ), EGc12 ( 303 RSHDSQGKIS 312 ), and EGc13 ( 430 DIPRFV 435 ). Of these, 7 could be recognized by GTV IgG-positive sheep sera. Three-dimensional structural analysis revealed that all 13 BCEs were present on the surface of the Gc protein. Sequence alignment of the 13 BCEs against homologous proteins from 10 closely related strains of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus from different geographical regions revealed that the amino acid sequences of EGc4, EGc5, EGc8, EGc11, and EGc12 were highly conserved, with 100% similarity. The remaining 8 epitopes (EGc1, EGc2, EGc3, EGc6, EGc7, EGc9, EGc10, and EGc13) showed high sequence similarity in the range of 71.43%–87.50%. These 13 BCEs of the GTV Gc protein provide a molecular foundation for future studies of the immunological properties of GTV glycoproteins and the development of GTV multi-epitope assays and vaccines."

We set out to assess the burden of the pandemic on provider outlook and understand how cancer survivorship providers experienced rapid changes to practice. Methods We distributed a survey through the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC) to its accredited organizations in mid-October 2020. We included questions on provider characteristics, changes in patient care practices resulting from the pandemic, worry about COVID-19, and concern about impact on cancer survivors. Results Of the n = 607 participants, three-quarters were female and three-quarters were White. Only 2.1% of participants reported having had COVID-19, but 43% reported anxiety about getting COVID-19 and over a quarter experienced sadness or depression, anxiety about the future, changes to sleep, difficulty concentrating, or social isolation. Approximately half of providers also expressed significant concern about progression of cancer in patients who experienced care delays or were afraid of accessing in-person care. In terms of changes to survivorship care, respondents reported changes to visitor policies, delays or cancellations, and efforts to reduce in-person visits. Conclusions COVID-19 has taken a significant toll on front-line healthcare professionals, including oncologists and cancer care allied health professionals. Findings support proactive mental health support of healthcare professionals as well as emergency preparedness to manage delays to care for cancer patients in the event of future unexpected pandemics."

Many are interested in quitting; however, little is known about psychosocial factors influencing smoking relapse in this population. This study, part of a larger project to develop an optimized smoking cessation intervention for youth experiencing homelessness, aimed to describe how psychosocial factors influence smoking relapse in this group.This study describes the smoking relapse experiences of 26 youth tobacco users, aged 14-24 years, who were recruited from a homeless drop-in center in Ohio. We conducted semi-structured interviews to understand how stress, opportunity, and coping contribute to smoking relapse.Five themes emerged from the data: (1) smoking as a lapse in emotional self-regulation in response to stress; (2) smoking as active emotional self-regulation in response to stress; (3) social opportunities facilitate smoking in the context of emotion-focused stress coping; (4) problem-focused stress coping; and (5) opportunity facilitates smoking relapse.Stress was a primary driver of smoking relapse among youth experiencing homelessness, yet social and environmental opportunities to smoke also precipitated relapse. Interventions to improve abstinence among this population should target foundational stressors, coping skills, social supports, and nicotine dependence."
https://openalex.org/W4288041539,"In order to improve energy absorption capacity of tubes under axial compression, this work introduces an octagon tube patterned by curved Miura origami pattern and aims at suppressing global buckling of the tube via an appropriate fold line scheme. By categorizing the fold lines of the tube into two types (hinge-like lines and continuous lines) and allocating them to different positions, four arrangement schemes of the lines are developed. Through numerical comparison in force-displacement curve, stress distribution and lateral deformation capacity among four 3-level patterned tubes under different schemes, Scheme 4 (inclined valley lines as hinge-like lines and the others as continuous lines) is found to outperform the others in suppressing global buckling by reducing the magnitude of lateral deformation by up to 59.9% and by delaying the occurrence of global buckling by up to 35.9% compared with the other schemes. To step further, the scheme is applied in a long tube and geometrically different tubes are compared. The results prove that the scheme is potentially an effective way to alleviate buckling instability of a long tube when appropriately designed."
