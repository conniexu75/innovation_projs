Nevertheless, it should prove useful in focusing attention on the apparent similarity in the response of a large number of specific cell types to particular stimuli. Emphasis has been placed on a few common and apparently key elements in these responses. It is recognized that other factors are undoubtedly involved. Specifically, the changes in membrane potentials indicate the likelihood of widespread changes in the properties of the cell membrane, for example, changes in Na(+) and K(+) transport and distribution. These aspects of cellular responses may eventually prove to be of equal or greater importance than those common aspects of the system already identified."
https://openalex.org/W1996446016,"Both cyclic AMP and a specific inducer acting in concert are required for the synthesis of many inducible enzymes in E. coli. Little enzyme is made in the absence of either. In contrast to the specific inducers which stimulate the synthesis only of the proteins required for their metabolism, cyclic AMP controls the synthesis of many proteins. Glucose and certain other carbohydrates decrease the differential rate of synthesis of inducible enzymes by lowering cyclic AMP concentrations. In the lac operon, cyclic AMP acts at the promoter site to facilitate initiation of transcription. This action requires another protein, the cyclic AMP receptor protein. The nucleotide stimulates tryptophanase synthesis at a translational level. The action of cyclic AMP in E. coli may serve as a model to understand its action on transcriptional and translational processes in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1524650698,"Abstract A purified rabbit skeletal muscle adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-stimulated protein kinase enhanced lipolytic activity in adipose tissue homogenates. This effect required the presence of cyclic AMP and ATP and was completely blocked by a protein inhibitor of cyclic AMP-stimulated protein kinases. It is inferred that this effect is due to the phosphorylation and activation of a lipase in a system analogous to that involved in the activation of muscle glycogen phosphorylase."

https://openalex.org/W1711178672,"Abstract The metal ion dependence of 32P binding to Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase has been studied by means of equilibrium dialysis. Whereas the apoenzyme does not bind phosphate (no sites with K l 5 x 10-5 m), the addition of 2 Zn(II) cations per molecule induces the tight binding of 1 phosphate dianion (K = 6 x 10-7 m). The magnitude of this binding constant is affected by ionic strength, pH, and protein concentration. Of the first transition and IIB metal ions, Mn(II), Co(II), Zn(II), and Cd(II) all induce the tight binding of one phosphate per dimer, but only Zn(II) and Co(II) induce enzymatic activity. Cu(II) is less effective, while Ni(II) and Hg(II) are ineffective in inducing phosphate binding. The formation of the phosphoryl enzyme, as measured by treatment of the 32P-protein mixture with perchloric acid, is also metal ion-dependent. The Zn(II) enzyme forms the phosphoryl enzyme only at low pH, a maximum of 0.6 mole per mole of dimer being observed at pH 5. The apoenzyme forms no phosphoryl enzyme at any pH. In marked contrast, Cd(II) induces the formation of significant equilibrium concentrations of phosphoryl enzyme in the alkaline pH range, reaching a maximum stoichiometry of 1 mole per mole of dimer at pH 6.5. Isolation of a phosphorylated peptide from the Cd(II) enzyme shows that the same seryl residue is phosphorylated in the Cd(II) protein as in the native Zn(II) enzyme. Mn(II) and Co(II) also induce the formation of significant amounts of phosphoryl enzyme in the alkaline pH region. Phosphorylation of the Cd(II) enzyme is relatively slow, k = ∼3 x 10-3 sec-1, but once formed the Cd(II) phosphoryl enzyme does not break down as shown by its failure to catalyze the exchange of 18O from H218O into inorganic phosphate. The data suggest that the metal ion plays an important role in formation and breakdown of the phosphoryl enzyme as well as in the binding of phosphate."

Cocultivation of tissues of these mice with non-virus-yielding hamster cells transformed by Moloney sarcoma virus, however, has resulted in the rescue of a pseudotype sarcoma virus, presumably carrying the New Zealand Black mouse leukemia virus coat. This virus has an unusual host restriction, producing foci of cell alteration only in rat cells."

https://openalex.org/W1658446512,"Abstract Incubation of bovine liver microsomes with partially purified phospholipase A from Naja naja venom inactivates the phosphohydrolase activities of glucose 6-phosphatase, but there is no quantitative correlation between hydrolysis of phospholipids and loss of enzyme activity. Furthermore, addition of EDTA to an incubating mixture of microsomes and phospholipase A completely stops hydrolysis of phospholipids, but does not halt the decline of glucose 6-phosphatase activity. These results indicate that hydrolysis of phospholipids by phospholipase A does not per se inactivate glucose 6-phosphatase. Instead, hydrolysis of phospholipids by phospholipase A produces an unstable form of the enzyme. The phospholipase A-treated form of glucose 6-phosphatase can be stabilized by asolectin and albumin, and at pH 5.75 by glucose-6-P or PPi. In contrast to its effects on phosphohydrolase activities, conditions of phospholipase A treatment which lead to a 50 to 60% loss of these activities activate slightly the phosphotransferase. It was found, however, that the phospholipase A treatment led to a pH-dependent instability of phosphotransferase which could be separated from the instability of phosphohydrolase activities. Phospholipids, in the form of asolectin, inhibit the phospholydrolase activities of untreated microsomes whereas they activate after phospholipase A treatment. Albumin, which has no effect on the untreated enzyme, is a more effective activating agent of phospholipase A-treated glucose 6-phosphatase than asolectin. Asolectin activates, but albumin inhibits, the phosphotransferase activity of phospholipase A-treated microsomes. Since either albumin or asolectin can increase the phosphohydrolase activity of phospholipase A-treated microsomes to levels greater than those of untreated ones, their activating action cannot result from reversal of phospholipase A effects. Phospholipase C treatment inactivates both the phosphohydrolase and phosphotransferase activities of glucose 6-phosphatase. This action does not seem to result from phospholipase C-induced instability of the enzyme. However, inactivation cannot be interpreted as indicating a phospholipid requirement for the enzyme since albumin, in addition to asolectin, activates phospholipase C-treated glucose 6-phosphatase, and the combined action of phospholipase C plus asolectin increases phosphotransferase activity to 50% greater than that of untreated microsomes."

https://openalex.org/W1556445154,"Abstract Glycopeptides from carp swim bladder, guinea pig skin, and human skin collagens were prepared by sequential collagenase-trypsin digestion. Gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 permitted the isolation of a low molecular weight fraction containing most of the hydroxylysyl glycosides present in the parent collagen. Application of this fraction to a Dowex 50X-8 ion exchange column consistently resulted in distinctive glycopeptide patterns characteristic of each collagen. The glycohexapeptide, Gly-Met-Hyl (Gal-Glc)-Gly-His-Arg, which had been previously characterized in digests of soluble guinea pig skin collagen, was found in significant quantities in all three collagens examined, but the carp and human collagens each revealed an additional major glycopeptide. The subtractive Edman procedure was used in establishing amino acid sequences, and alkaline hydrolysis was used to confirm the composition and mode of attachment of the carbohydrate side chains. The predominant glycopeptide isolated from carp swim bladder collagen was Gly-Ile-Hyl(Gal-Glc)-Gly-His-Arg, while the structure of the unique glycopeptide isolated from human skin collagen was Gly-Phe-Hyl(Gal-Glc)-Gly-Ile-Arg. A possible role of the carbohydrate side chains in the organization of fibrils is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1633150347,"The isolation and characterization of an intermediate between farnesyl pyrophosphate and squalene is described. This intermediate, presqualene pyrophosphate, has been identified as 2-(2,6,10-trimethyl-1,6,9-undecatriene)-3-methyl-3-(4,8-dimethyl-3,7-nonadiene)-cyclopropylcarbinyl-pyrophosphate. Chemical reduction of presqualene pyrophosphate by LiAlH4 yielded an alcohol and a mixture of hydrocarbons. The mass spectrum of the alcohol had a fragmentation pattern characteristic of a primary alcohol and showed the alcohol to have the formula C30H49OH. A deuterated isomer of the alcohol was prepared from presqualene pyrophosphate which had been synthesized from farnesyl-1,1-2H-pyrophosphate. The mass spectrum of this alcohol established the origin of the carbinol carbon of the intermediate as C-1 of one farnesyl substituent and showed the loss of a hydrogen from C-1 of the other farnesyl moiety in the carbon system of presqualene pyrophosphate. The presence of a cyclopropane ring in presqualene pyrophosphate was indicated by the behavior of its derivatives on catalytic hydrogenation. The position of the cyclopropane ring was established by the mass spectra of the hydrogenated hydrocarbons derived from presqualene pyrophosphate. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of presqualene pyrophosphate and presqualene alcohol were consistent with the proposed structure. Consideration of the mechanism of synthesis of presqualene pyrophosphate has led us to postulate a configuration for the substituents on the cyclopropane ring. A mechanism for the conversion of the intermediate to squalene based on analogy with the reactions of similar organic compounds is in accord with the stereochemical requirements established for squalene biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1532874851,"Abstract Net transport of α-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) was increased in liver slices prepared from rats injected with hydrocortisone, epinephrine, or glucagon. When slices from untreated animals were initially incubated for 15 min with glucagon or cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) subsequent uptake of AIB in the presence of either agent was greater than in control experiments; epinephrine was without effect. If extended preliminary incubation with glucagon or cyclic AMP preceded the final incubation with AIB the net increase in uptake was 4 to 6 times that seen with a short preliminary incubation. Under these conditions epinephrine produced a distinct, but relatively small, increase in AIB transport. 1-Aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid transport was also stimulated in liver slices from rats injected with glucagon or in slices incubated in vitro with glucagon or cyclic AMP. These experiments show that glucagon, cyclic AMP, and epinephrine can stimulate to varying degrees amino acid transport in liver slices in vitro; therefore, these agents may directly affect hepatic amino acid transport in vivo. AIB uptake was relatively high in control liver slices after preliminary incubation for extended periods in Krebs-Ringer buffer alone. The effect was blocked by initially incubating the tissue in an ice bath or with cycloheximide; actinomycin D was less effective. These drugs also inhibited cyclic AMP-induced stimulation of AIB transport. Amino acid analyses of extracts of incubated slices provided little evidence that exchange diffusion is of major significance in stimulation of AIB transport by cyclic AMP."

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of manganese (II) protoporphyrin IX and its apohemoprotein complexes were measured at X- and K-band frequencies in the temperature range from 4.2°K to 253°K and compared with those of the corresponding high spin iron (III) compounds. The ligand fields of these transition metal ions in 3d5 (S = 5/2) ground states were found to have an essentially axial symmetry, in agreement with EPR studies of high spin ferric hemoproteins by Ingram and his associates. The axial ligand field of the manganese (II) ion in manganese protoporphyrin IX was further distorted rhombically upon binding to apohemoproteins. These axial and rhombic distortions of the ligand field symmetry of the manganese (II) ion were quantitatively estimated by determining zero field splitting parameters D and λ from EPR characteristics. The combination of metalloporphyrins to apohemoproteins appeared to be an excellent method of achieving an ideal magnetic dilution of paramagnetic centers for EPR studies."
https://openalex.org/W1608734593,"Abstract The effects of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) on glycerol production by isolated fat cells resembled those of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) but were of lesser magnitude. In Krebs-Ringer phosphate medium, both nucleotides had little or no effect on basal lipolysis. Inhibition of theophylline-stimulated lipolysis by cyclic GMP was less and more variable than that by cyclic AMP. In phosphate 0.8% NaCl medium, with Na+ as the only cation, both nucleotides stimulated glycerol production. The increase was directly related to the concentration of each. On a molar basis, cyclic GMP was less effective than cyclic AMP in stimulating lipolysis. Lipolytic effects of cyclic GMP were also observed in the presence of cyclic AMP and theophylline at concentrations that did not maximally stimulate lipolysis. During incubation of fat cells with cyclic GMP in either medium, accumulation of cyclic AMP was observed. The magnitude of this increase in cyclic AMP was related to the concentration of cyclic GMP over the range of 0.1 to 5 mm. In the presence of 1 mm cyclic GMP, the rate of accumulation of cyclic AMP was essentially constant for 2 hours. After incubation with cyclic GMP, the amount of cyclic AMP in the medium was apparently as high as in cells plus medium. The accumulation of cyclic AMP in the presence of cyclic GMP was not affected by prostaglandin E1 (5 µg per ml), insulin (12 milliunits per ml) or probenecid (0.1 mm). The latter agent did not alter the distribution of cyclic AMP between cells and medium whether or not cyclic GMP was present. The rate of accumulation of cyclic AMP in the presence of 1 mm cyclic GMP was 10 to 20% of that observed during the first 4 min after epinephrine (1.1 µm) was added to fat cells. During the 4 min after epinephrine was added, the accumulation of cyclic AMP was almost entirely intracellular and was not altered by the presence of cyclic GMP. After incubation for more than 30 min under all conditions, a large fraction of the cyclic AMP in the system was found in the medium. Cyclic GMP was 30 to 100 times more effective on a molar basis than was theophylline in preventing the degradation of cyclic AMP by extracts from fat cells. Cyclic GMP also inhibited degradation of cyclic AMP by homogenates of rat kidney and liver. This effect may account for the accumulation of cyclic AMP that occurred when kidney cortex, liver, and chicken erythrocytes were incubated with cyclic GMP with or without hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1587744202,"Abstract A peptide corresponding to the 14 amino acid residues at the COOH terminus of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease has been synthesized by the solid phase method. When this peptide was mixed with ribonuclease that had been inactivated by proteolytic removal of the 6 residues (-His-Phe-Asp-Ala-Ser-Val) at the COOH terminus, 90% of the activity of native RNase was regenerated toward cyclic 2',3'-cytidylic acid as substrate and 70% toward RNA at a peptide to protein ratio of 3. High activity was also regenerated when only 5 residues had been removed from RNase and moderate activity was obtained when 4 residues had been removed. No activity could be recovered when the full complement of residues was present but the molecule had been inactivated by carboxymethylation of histidine-119. It was further found that peptides representing both ends of the RNase molecule, the NH2-terminal S-peptide (1–20) and the COOH-terminal peptide (111–124), containing both of the catalytically essential histidine residues, could be bound noncovalently to an inactive core (21–118) to regenerate activity."

https://openalex.org/W1566089905,"Abstract A method leading to partial purification of mung bean nuclease I (potency 250) in good yield is described. Mung bean nuclease I of potency 1800 was obtained in small yield. At this stage the preparation showed two bands on disc electrophoresis. Throughout all stages of purification the nuclease activity was accompanied by (3')-ω-monophosphatase activity, suggesting that both activities are intrinsic properties of the same enzyme molecule. Dinucleotides dNpNp were first dephosphorylated by this enzyme to dNpN; then the internucleotide linkage was cleaved to form dN + dpN. The ω-monophosphatase hydrolyzes ribose mononucleotides 50- to 100-fold faster than the corresponding deoxyribose compounds. It also shows preference for bases, the order agrees with that previously established for the nuclease activity: A g T(U) g C g G. For the nuclease activity one exception was noted, ribopoly U was hydrolyzed faster than ribopoly A, presumably because the former lacks an ordered structure."

https://openalex.org/W1492598719,"Abstract Based on the previous observations that gossypol is biosynthetically formed from acetate, and from the location of the incorporated 14C atoms, gossypol biosynthesis via the isoprenoid pathway has been postulated. To support this hypothesis, the incorporation of mevalonate-2-14C (a key intermediate in the isoprenoid pathway) into gossypol as well as the distribution of the radioactivity in the gossypol molecule was studied. The results showed that 6 molecules of mevalonate-2-14C are stereospecifically incorporated into 1 molecule of gossypol. The monoterpene alcohols, geraniol-2-14C and nerol-2-14C, were chemically synthesized and the incorporation of their respective pyrophosphate ester into gossypol was tested. The incorporation of geranyl-2-14C pyrophosphate into gossypol was equal to the incorporation of mevalonate-2-14C, whereas neryl-2-14C pyrophosphate was utilized twice as efficiently as mevalonate-2-14C. The location of the 14C atoms of these substrates in the gossypol molecule was consistent with the isoprenoid pathway. Similarly, the cis-cis isomer of the sesquiterpene alcohol, farnesyl-2-14C-PP, was 4 times as efficient as substrate compared to the trans-cis isomer. In constrast, the incorporation of trans-trans- and cis-trans-farnesyl-2-14C-PP into gossypol was negligible. From the labeling pattern of gossypol synthesized from mevalonate-2-14C, neryl-2-14C-PP, and trans-cis-farnesyl-2-14C-PP, it is proposed that gossypol is produced by a specific cyclization of cis-cis-farnesyl pyrophosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1585117828,"Abstract Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and isoproterenol prevent the induction of rat liver glucokinase (EC 2.7.1.2) produced by the administration of glucose to animals with low levels of the enzyme. The low levels of glucokinase were obtained by feeding the animals a carbohydrate-free diet for 6 days. When epinephrine was given 4 hours after the administration of carbohydrate there was only a slight inhibition of the rate of enzyme increase, whereas when given simultaneously with the carbohydrate there was a complete blockade of the induction. The N6, O2'-dibutyryl analogue of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate also inhibited glucokinase induction. Insulin counteracted about 50% of the epinephrine effect, but not the inhibition elicited by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The data suggest that the epinephrine action on glucokinase induction may result both from a direct effect on the liver cell, possibly mediated by cyclic AMP, and a blockade of insulin secretion at the pancreas."

https://openalex.org/W1552270283,"Complexes of liver alcohol dehydrogenase with pyrazole and NAD+, NHD+, or AcPyAD+ were studied by spectral, kinetic, and equilibrium binding techniques. Difference spectra showed the same peak, 290 mµ, for ternary complex with NAD+ or NHD+ as coenzyme but with AcPyAD+ as coenzyme the peak appeared at 308 mµ. The dissociation constants of coenzyme from the ternary complex were much higher for the two analogues than for NAD+. Stopped flow studies showed that for NHD+ the higher dissociation constant was due to a decreased on velocity of the coenzyme but for AcPyAD+ it was due to a higher off velocity than NAD+. The dissociation constants of pyrazole from the ternary complexes were the same for complexes with NAD+ and NHD+ but 8-fold higher for complex containing AcPyAD+. This was due to a much slower pyrazole on velocity. The results of this study indicate that pyrazole interacts with the nicotinamide ring of NAD+ in the ternary complex. The nature of this interaction is discussed."

The 4.5 S RNAiii is an extranucleolar nuclear species not found in the cytoplasm. The present study demonstrates that nuclear 4.5 S RNAiii is a unique RNA species with adenosine 3',5'-diphosphate residue (pAp) as the 5'-terminal and 2'-O-methyl uridine as the 3'-terminal nucleoside. It has a very low Tm of 37.5°. Its molecular weight is approximately 28,000 based upon mobility in polyacrylamide gels and 5'-terminal analyses. Analysis of the alkali-resistant dinucleotides showed that the 4.5 S RNAiii contains four alkali-resistant dinucleotides, i.e., adenosine 2'-O-methyl-3'-phosphoryl adenosine 3'-phosphate (AmpAp), guanosine 2'-O-methyl-3'-phosphoryl adenosine 3'-phosphate (GmpAp), and 2 guanosine 2'-O-methyl-3'-phosphorylguanosine 3'-phosphate residues (Gmp-Gp). After hydrolysis with pancreatic RNase, analysis of oligonucleotide frequencies indicates that most of the molecule is cleaved into mono- to tetranucleotides, i.e. only 18% remaining in larger fragments.

https://openalex.org/W1530105605,Abstract The H4 isozyme of bovine lactate dehydrogenase was guanidinated with O-methyl isourea and its properties were compared with those of the native enzyme. Kinetic evidence suggests that coenzyme binding is not affected by guanidination but that the rate of dissociation of substrates is diminished. Fluorimetric titrations with NADH confirm the kinetic results and show that both oxamate and oxalate are bound more firmly by the complex between guanidinated enzyme and NADH than by the native enzyme·NADH complex. The changes in binding of inhibitors appear to result from the modification of several amino groups rather than from derivatization of a single essential group. It is proposed that strong interactions between carboxylate and guanidinium ions stabilize the ternary enzyme·coenzyme·inhibitor complex. Improved methods are presented for calculation of dissociation constants of enzyme·NADH·inhibitor complexes from fluorescence titration curves.

In order to understand how nucleic acids are synthesized and hydrolyzed by such transformed cells, a nuclease has been purified 1000-fold. The enzyme is optimally active at an alkaline pH (8.7 to 9.5) and hydrolyzes RNA and heat-denatured DNA. Native DNA is highly resistant to the enzyme. The RNase and DNase activities appear to reside in the same protein. The relative rates of hydrolysis of a number of synthetic polynucleotides, RNA, and DNA are as follows: polyuridylate (100), polydeoxythymidylate (71), polycytidylate (46), polyinosinate (33), polyadenylate (18), ribosomal-RNA (16), heat-denatured Escherichia coli DNA (7), transfer RNA (4), polydeoxyadenylate (2), polydeoxycytidylate (l2), and polyguanylate (0). The enzyme prefers, as substrates, polynucleotides which lack an ordered structure. The hydrolysis of polyadenylate or polydeoxythymidylate yields oligonucleotides with terminal 5'-phosphates. A concentration of 0.04 m NaCl or KCl inhibits the enzyme. The enzyme should be useful in preparing 5'-phosphoryl-terminated oligonucleotides from DNA. A similar enzyme appears to be present in a continuous line of baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21 C13)."
