https://openalex.org/W2052578334,"The human blood brain barrier (BBB) is a selective barrier formed by human brain endothelial cells (hBECs), which is important to ensure adequate neuronal function and protect the central nervous system (CNS) from disease. The development of human in vitro BBB models is thus of utmost importance for drug discovery programs related to CNS diseases. Here, we describe a method to generate a human BBB model using cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem cells. The cells were initially differentiated into ECs followed by the induction of BBB properties by co-culture with pericytes. The brain-like endothelial cells (BLECs) express tight junctions and transporters typically observed in brain endothelium and maintain expression of most in vivo BBB properties for at least 20 days. The model is very reproducible since it can be generated from stem cells isolated from different donors and in different laboratories, and could be used to predict CNS distribution of compounds in human. Finally, we provide evidence that Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway mediates in part the BBB inductive properties of pericytes."
https://openalex.org/W2014299620,"Over the last two decades, the identification of missense mutations in the α-synuclein (α-Syn) gene SNCA in families with inherited Parkinson disease (PD) has reinforced the central role of α-Syn in PD pathogenesis. Recently, a new missense mutation (H50Q) in α-Syn was described in patients with a familial form of PD and dementia. Here we investigated the effects of this novel mutation on the biophysical properties of α-Syn and the consequences for its cellular function. We found that the H50Q mutation affected neither the structure of free or membrane-bound α-Syn monomer, its interaction with metals, nor its capacity to be phosphorylated in vitro. However, compared with the wild-type (WT) protein, the H50Q mutation accelerated α-Syn fibrillization in vitro. In cell-based models, H50Q mutation did not affect α-Syn subcellular localization or its ability to be phosphorylated by PLK2 and GRK6. Interestingly, H50Q increased α-Syn secretion from SHSY5Y cells into culture medium and induced more mitochondrial fragmentation in hippocampal neurons. Although the transient overexpression of WT or H50Q did not induce toxicity, both species induced significant cell death when added to the culture medium of hippocampal neurons. Strikingly, H50Q exhibited more toxicity, suggesting that the H50Q-related enhancement of α-Syn aggregation and secretion may play a role in the extracellular toxicity of this mutant. Together, our results provide novel insight into the mechanism by which this newly described PD-associated mutation may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD and related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2018499838,"Inflammation is crucially involved in the development of carotid plaques. We examined the relationship between plaque vulnerability and inflammatory biomarkers using intraoperative blood and tissue specimens. We examined 58 patients with carotid stenosis. Following carotid plaque magnetic resonance imaging, 41 patients underwent carotid artery stenting (CAS) and 17 underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Blood samples were obtained from the femoral artery (systemic) and common carotid artery immediately before and after CAS (local). Seventeen resected CEA tissue samples were embedded in paraffin, and histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses for IL-6, IL-10, E-selectin, adiponectin, and pentraxin 3 (PTX3) were performed. Serum levels of IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, TNFα, E-selectin, VCAM-1, adiponectin, hs-CRP, and PTX3 were measured by multiplex bead array system and ELISA. CAS-treated patients were classified as stable plaques (n = 21) and vulnerable plaques (n = 20). The vulnerable group showed upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNFα), endothelial activation markers (E-selectin and VCAM-1), and inflammation markers (hs-CRP and PTX3) and downregulation of the anti-inflammatory markers (adiponectin and IL-10). PTX3 levels in both systemic and intracarotid samples before and after CAS were higher in the vulnerable group than in the stable group. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that IL-6 was localized to inflammatory cells in the vulnerable plaques, and PTX3 was observed in the endothelial and perivascular cells. Our findings reveal that carotid plaque vulnerability is modulated by the upregulation and downregulation of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors, respectively. PTX3 may thus be a potential predictive marker of plaque vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W2129162505,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline associated with a featured neuropathology (neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles). Several studies have implicated oxidative damage to DNA, DNA repair, and altered cell-cycle regulation in addition to cell death in AD post-mitotic neurons. However, there is a lack of studies that systematically assess those biological processes in patients with AD neuropathology but with no evidence of cognitive impairment. We evaluated markers of oxidative DNA damage (8-OHdG, H2AX), DNA repair (p53, BRCA1, PTEN), and cell-cycle (Cdk1, Cdk4, Cdk5, Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1, p27Kip1, phospho-Rb and E2F1) through immunohistochemistry and cell death through TUNEL in autopsy hippocampal tissue samples arrayed in a tissue microarray (TMA) composed of three groups: I) “clinical-pathological AD” (CP-AD) - subjects with neuropathological AD (Braak≥IV and CERAD = B or C) and clinical dementia (CDR≥2, IQCODE>3.8); II) “pathological AD” (P-AD) - subjects with neuropathological AD (Braak≥IV and CERAD = B or C) and without cognitive impairment (CDR 0, IQCODE<3.2); and III) “normal aging” (N) - subjects without neuropathological AD (Braak≤II and CERAD 0 or A) and with normal cognitive function (CDR 0, IQCODE<3.2). Our results show that high levels of oxidative DNA damage are present in all groups. However, significant reductions in DNA repair and cell-cycle inhibition markers and increases in cell-cycle progression and cell death markers in subjects with CP-AD were detected when compared to both P-AD and N groups, whereas there were no significant differences in the studied markers between P-AD individuals and N subjects. This study indicates that, even in the setting of pathological AD, healthy cognition may be associated with a preserved repair to DNA damage, cell-cycle regulation, and cell death in post-mitotic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2027788816,"The use of mixed microbial communities (microbiomes) for biotechnological applications has steadily increased over the past decades. However, these microbiomes are not readily available from public culture collections, hampering their potential for widespread use. The main reason for this lack of availability is the lack of an effective cryopreservation protocol. Due to this critical need, we evaluated the functionality as well as the community structure of three different types of microbiomes before and after cryopreservation with two cryoprotective agents (CPA). Microbiomes were selected based upon relevance towards applications: (1) a methanotrophic co-culture (MOB), with potential for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, environmental pollutants removal and bioplastics production; (2) an oxygen limited autotrophic nitrification/denitrification (OLAND) biofilm, with enhanced economic and ecological benefits for wastewater treatment, and (3) fecal material from a human donor, with potential applications for fecal transplants and pre/probiotics research. After three months of cryopreservation at -80 °C, we found that metabolic activity, in terms of the specific activity recovery of MOB, aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AerAOB) and anaerobic AOB (AnAOB, anammox) in the OLAND mixed culture, resumes sooner when one of our selected CPA [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and DMSO plus trehalose and tryptic soy broth (DMSO+TT)] was added. However, the activity of the fecal community was not influenced by the CPA addition, although the preservation of the community structure (as determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing) was enhanced by addition of CPA. In summary, we have evaluated a cryopreservation protocol that succeeded in preserving both community structure and functionality of value-added microbiomes. This will allow individual laboratories and culture collections to boost the use of microbiomes in biotechnological applications."

https://openalex.org/W2041455501,"Hendra virus causes sporadic but typically fatal infection in horses and humans in eastern Australia. Fruit-bats of the genus Pteropus (commonly known as flying-foxes) are the natural host of the virus, and the putative source of infection in horses; infected horses are the source of human infection. Effective treatment is lacking in both horses and humans, and notwithstanding the recent availability of a vaccine for horses, exposure risk mitigation remains an important infection control strategy. This study sought to inform risk mitigation by identifying spatial and environmental risk factors for equine infection using multiple analytical approaches to investigate the relationship between plausible variables and reported Hendra virus infection in horses. Spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran’s I) showed significant clustering of equine cases at a distance of 40 km, a distance consistent with the foraging ‘footprint’ of a flying-fox roost, suggesting the latter as a biologically plausible basis for the clustering. Getis-Ord Gi* analysis identified multiple equine infection hot spots along the eastern Australia coast from far north Queensland to central New South Wales, with the largest extending for nearly 300 km from southern Queensland to northern New South Wales. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) showed the density of P. alecto and P. conspicillatus to have the strongest positive correlation with equine case locations, suggesting these species are more likely a source of infection of Hendra virus for horses than P. poliocephalus or P. scapulatus. The density of horses, climate variables and vegetation variables were not found to be a significant risk factors, but the residuals from the GWR suggest that additional unidentified risk factors exist at the property level. Further investigations and comparisons between case and control properties are needed to identify these local risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2018058756,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by synovial fibroblast hyperplasia and bone and cartilage erosion. Synovial fibroblast- and T cell-mediated inflammation plays crucial roles in the pathogenesis of RA. However how this inflammation is initiated, propagated, and maintained remains controversial. Here, we systemically examined the contribution of toll-like receptors (TLRs) to the inflammatory mediator production as well as Th1 and Th17 cell hyperactivity in RA. Our results show that rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASF) express a series of TLRs, including TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9, with the predominant expression of TLR3. Moreover, the expression levels of these TLRs were higher than those in osteoarthritis synovial fibroblasts (OASF). Ligation of TLR3, as well as TLR2 and TLR4, resulted in vigorous production of inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in RASF, with activation of the NF-κB, MAPK, and IRF3 pathways. More important, activation of these TLRs expressed by RASF exacerbated inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cell expansion both in cell-cell contact-dependent and inflammatory cytokine-dependent manners, which induced more IFN-γ and IL-17 accumulation. Targeting TLRs may modulate the inflammation in RA and provide new therapeutic strategies for overcoming this persistent disease."
https://openalex.org/W2006871857,"Protein glycosylation catalyzed by the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) plays a critical role in various biological processes. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, the core enzyme GtfA and co-activator GtfB form an OGT complex to glycosylate the serine-rich repeat (SRR) of adhesin PsrP (pneumococcal serine-rich repeat protein), which is involved in the infection and pathogenesis. Here we report the 2.0 Å crystal structure of GtfA, revealing a β-meander add-on domain beyond the catalytic domain. It represents a novel add-on domain, which is distinct from the all-α-tetratricopeptide repeats in the only two structure-known OGTs. Structural analyses combined with binding assays indicate that this add-on domain contributes to forming an active GtfA-GtfB complex and recognizing the acceptor protein. In addition, the in vitro glycosylation system enables us to map the O-linkages to the serine residues within the first SRR of PsrP. These findings suggest that fusion with an add-on domain might be a universal mechanism for diverse OGTs that recognize varying acceptor proteins/peptides.

https://openalex.org/W2104832574,"Germline TP53 mutations predispose individuals to multiple cancers and are associated with Li-Fraumeni/Li-Fraumeni-Like Syndromes (LFS/LFL). The founder mutation TP53 p.R337H is detected in 0.3% of the general population in southern Brazil. This mutation is associated with an increased risk of childhood adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) but is also common in Brazilian LFS/LFL families. Breast Cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers diagnosed in TP53 mutation carriers. We have assessed the prevalence of p.R337H in two groups: (1) 59 BC affected women with a familial history (FH) suggestive of hereditary cancer syndrome but no LFS/LFL features; (2) 815 BC affected women unselected for cancer FH, diagnosed with BC at or before age 45 or at age 55 or older. Among group 1 and group 2 patients, 2/59 (3.4%, CI95%: 0.4%-11.7%) and 70/815 (8.6%, CI95%: 6.8%-10.7%), respectively, were p.R337H carriers in the germline. The prevalence of p.R337H was higher in women diagnosed with BC at or before age 45 (12.1%, CI95%: 9.1%-15.8%) than at age 55 or older (5.1%, CI95%: 3.2%-7.7%), p<0.001). The Brazilian founder p.R337H haplotype was detected in all carriers analysed. These results suggest that inheritance of p.R337H may significantly contribute to the high incidence of BC in Brazil, in addition to its recently demonstrated impact on the risk of childhood ACC."
https://openalex.org/W2059179946,"What level of immunocompetence should an animal maintain while undertaking long-distance dispersal? Immune function (surveillance and response) might be down-regulated during prolonged physical exertion due to energy depletion, and/or to avoid autoimmune reactions arising from damaged tissue. On the other hand, heightened immune vigilance might be favored if the organism encounters novel pathogens as it enters novel environments. We assessed the links between immune defense and long-distance movement in a population of invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) in Australia. Toads were radio-tracked for seven days to measure their activity levels and were then captured and subjected to a suite of immune assays. Toads that moved further showed decreased bacteria-killing ability in their plasma and decreased phagocytic activity in their whole blood, but a heightened skin-swelling response to phytohemagglutinin. Baseline and post-stress corticosterone levels were unrelated to distance moved. Thus, long-distance movement in cane toads is associated with a dampened response in some systems and enhanced response in another. This pattern suggests that sustained activity is accompanied by trade-offs among immune components rather than an overall down or up-regulation. The finding that high mobility is accompanied by modification of the immune system has important implications for animal invasions."
https://openalex.org/W2025653977,"Inflammation is now widely recognized as a key component of heart disease. Patients suffering from arrhythmias and heart failure have increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Evidence suggests that these cytokines are important mediators of cardiac remodeling; however, their effects on ion channels and arrhythmogenesis remain incompletely understood. The L-type Ca(2+) current (ICaL) is a major determinant of the plateau phase of cardiac action potential and has a critical excitation-contraction coupling role. Thus, altering its properties could have detrimental effects on cardiac electrical and contractile functions. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to elucidate the effect of TNFα and IL-1β on ICaL, while exploring the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Neonatal mouse ventricular myocytes were treated with a pathophysiological concentration (30 pg/ml) of TNFα and IL-1β for 24 h. Voltage-clamp recordings showed that TNFα had no effect on ICaL, whereas IL-1β decreased the current density by 36%. Although both IL-1β- and TNFα-treated myocytes showed significant increase in reactive oxidative species (ROS), Western blot experiments revealed that only IL-1β increased PKCϵ membrane translocation. The antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine normalized ROS levels and restored ICaL density. Furthermore, the PKCϵ translocation inhibitor ϵ-V1-2 blocked the effect of IL-1β on ICaL. The reduction of ICaL by IL-1β was also seen in cultured adult ventricular myocytes. Overall, chronic IL-1β treatment decreased ICaL density in cardiomyocytes. These effects implicated ROS signaling and PKCϵ activation. These findings could contribute to explain the role of IL-1β in the development of arrhythmia and heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2077825206,"Aims To investigate if nuclear NF-κB p65 expression in ex vivo isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells correlates with urinary MCP-1 or RANTES and the severity of type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Methods According to their urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR), 107 patients with type 2 diabetes (eGFR >60 ml/min) were divided into normal albuminuria group (DN0 group, 38 cases), microalbuminuria group (DN1 group, 38 cases), and macroalbuminuria group (DN2 group, 31 cases), compared with matched healthy normal control group (NC group, 30 cases). Nuclear NF-κB p65 protein expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detected by western blotting. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect NF-κB p65 mRNA expression and ELISA assay was used to detect the levels of urinary MCP-1 and RANTES. Results Nuclear NF-κB p65 protein and NF-κB p65 mRNA expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, urinary MCP-1/Cr and RANTES/Cr were all significantly higher in all diabetes groups as compared with NC group. In particular, the increase of nuclear NF-κB p65 protein and NF-κB p65 mRNA expressions, urinary MCP-1/Cr and RANTES/Cr all correlated with the severity of type 2 diabetic nephropathy as indicated by the increase in uACR. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that both urinary MCP-1/Cr and RANTES/Cr were positively correlated with nuclear NF-κB p65 protein or NF-κB p65 mRNA levels. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that nuclear NF-κB p65 protein or NF-κB p65 mRNA was an independent variable for urinary MCP-1/Cr, and MCP-1/Cr and RANTES/Cr were two independent variables for uACR. Conclusion Our research demonstrates that nuclear NF-κB p65 protein and mRNA expressions in ex vivo isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells well correlate with urinary MCP-1/Cr, RANTES/Cr and the severity of type 2 diabetic nephropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2161170295,"Free D-amino acids (D-AAs) are one of the most striking features of the peptidoglycan composition in bacteria and play a key role in regulating and disassembling bacterial biofilms. Previous studies have indicated that the antimicrobial peptide nisin can inhibit the growth of the cariogenic bacteria Streptococcus mutans. The present study investigated the effect of free amino acids either alone or in combination with nisin on biofilm and on planktonic S. mutans bacteria. The results of the MIC and MBC analyses showed that D-cysteine (Cys), D- or L-aspartic acid (Asp), and D- or L-glutamic acid (Glu) significantly improve the antibacterial activity of nisin against S. mutans and that the mixture of D-Cys, D-Asp, and D-Glu (3D-AAs) and the mixture of L-Cys, L-Asp, and L-Glu (3L-AAs) at a concentration of 40 mM can prevent S. mutans growth. Crystal violet staining showed that the D- or L-enantiomers of Cys, Asp, and Glu at a concentration of 40 mM can inhibit the formation of S. mutans biofilms, and their mixture generated a stronger inhibition than the components alone. Furthermore, the mixture of the three D-AAs or L-AAs may improve the antibacterial activity of nisin against S. mutans biofilms. This study underscores the potential of free amino acids for the enhancement of the antibacterial activity of nisin and the inhibition of the cariogenic bacteria S. mutans and biofilms."
https://openalex.org/W1994853971,"Nuclear receptors (NRs) are an important group of ligand-dependent transcriptional factors. Presently, no natural or synthetic ligand has been identified for a large group of orphan NRs. Small molecules to target these orphan NRs will provide unique resources for uncovering regulatory systems that impact human health and to modulate these pathways with drugs. The orphan NR tailless (TLX, NR2E1), a transcriptional repressor, is a major player in neurogenesis and Neural Stem Cell (NSC) derived brain tumors. No chemical probes that modulate TLX activity are available, and it is not clear whether TLX is druggable. To assess TLX ligand binding capacity, we created homology models of the TLX ligand binding domain (LBD). Results suggest that TLX belongs to an emerging class of NRs that lack LBD helices α1 and α2 and that it has potential to form a large open ligand binding pocket (LBP). Using a medium throughput screening strategy, we investigated direct binding of 20,000 compounds to purified human TLX protein and verified interactions with a secondary (orthogonal) assay. We then assessed effects of verified binders on TLX activity using luciferase assays. As a result, we report identification of three compounds (ccrp1, ccrp2 and ccrp3) that bind to recombinant TLX protein with affinities in the high nanomolar to low micromolar range and enhance TLX transcriptional repressive activity. We conclude that TLX is druggable and propose that our lead compounds could serve as scaffolds to derive more potent ligands. While our ligands potentiate TLX repressive activity, the question of whether it is possible to develop ligands to de-repress TLX activity remains open."
https://openalex.org/W2092843914,"Intervertebral disc degeneration is accompanied by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines that have been implicated in disease etiology and matrix degradation. While the effects of inflammatory stimulation on disc cell metabolism have been well-studied, their effects on cell biophysical properties have not been investigated. The hypothesis of this study is that inflammatory stimulation alters the biomechanical properties of isolated disc cells and volume responses to step osmotic loading. Cells from the nucleus pulposus (NP) of bovine discs were isolated and treated with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an inflammatory ligand, or with the recombinant cytokine TNF-α for 24 hours. We measured cellular volume regulation responses to osmotic loading either immediately after stimulation or after a 1 week recovery period from the inflammatory stimuli. Cells from each group were tested under step osmotic loading and the transient volume-response was captured via time-lapse microscopy. Volume-responses were analyzed using mixture theory framework to investigate two biomechanical properties of the cell, the intracellular water content and the hydraulic permeability. Intracellular water content did not vary between treatment groups, but hydraulic permeability increased significantly with inflammatory treatment. In the 1 week recovery group, hydraulic permeability remained elevated relative to the untreated recovery control. Cell radius was also significantly increased both after 24 hours of treatment and after 1 week recovery. A significant linear correlation was observed between hydraulic permeability and cell radius in untreated cells at 24 hours and at 1-week recovery, though not in the inflammatory stimulated groups at either time point. This loss of correlation between cell size and hydraulic permeability suggests that regulation of volume change is disrupted irreversibly due to inflammatory stimulation. Inflammatory treated cells exhibited altered F-actin cytoskeleton expression relative to untreated cells. We also found a significant decrease in the expression of aquaporin-1, the predominant water channel in disc NP cells, with inflammatory stimulation. To our knowledge, this is the first study providing evidence that inflammatory stimulation directly alters the mechanobiology of NP cells. The cellular biophysical changes observed in this study are coincident with documented changes in the extracellular matrix induced by inflammation, and may be important in disease etiology."
https://openalex.org/W2060993546,"High throughput sequencing has accelerated the determination of genome sequences for thousands of human infectious disease pathogens and dozens of their vectors. The scale and scope of these data are enabling genotype-phenotype association studies to identify genetic determinants of pathogen virulence and drug/insecticide resistance, and phylogenetic studies to track the origin and spread of disease outbreaks. To maximize the utility of genomic sequences for these purposes, it is essential that metadata about the pathogen/vector isolate characteristics be collected and made available in organized, clear, and consistent formats. Here we report the development of the GSCID/BRC Project and Sample Application Standard, developed by representatives of the Genome Sequencing Centers for Infectious Diseases (GSCIDs), the Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRCs) for Infectious Diseases, and the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), informed by interactions with numerous collaborating scientists. It includes mapping to terms from other data standards initiatives, including the Genomic Standards Consortium’s minimal information (MIxS) and NCBI’s BioSample/BioProjects checklists and the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI). The standard includes data fields about characteristics of the organism or environmental source of the specimen, spatial-temporal information about the specimen isolation event, phenotypic characteristics of the pathogen/vector isolated, and project leadership and support. By modeling metadata fields into an ontology-based semantic framework and reusing existing ontologies and minimum information checklists, the application standard can be extended to support additional project-specific data fields and integrated with other data represented with comparable standards. The use of this metadata standard by all ongoing and future GSCID sequencing projects will provide a consistent representation of these data in the BRC resources and other repositories that leverage these data, allowing investigators to identify relevant genomic sequences and perform comparative genomics analyses that are both statistically meaningful and biologically relevant."
https://openalex.org/W2086730068,"The ability of seed-borne bacterial pathogens (Acidovorax citrulli, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, Xanthomonas euvesicatoria, and Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea) to infest seeds of host and non-host plants (watermelon, tomato, pepper, and soybean) and subsequent pathogen transmission to seedlings was investigated. A non-pathogenic, pigmented strain of Serratia marcescens was also included to assess a null-interacting situation with the same plant species. Flowers of host and non-host plants were inoculated with 1 × 10(6) colony forming units (CFUs)/flower for each bacterial species and allowed to develop into fruits or umbels (in case of onion). Seeds harvested from each host/non-host bacterial species combination were assayed for respective bacteria by plating on semi-selective media. Additionally, seedlots for each host/non-host bacterial species combination were also assayed for pathogen transmission by seedling grow-out (SGO) assays under greenhouse conditions. The mean percentage of seedlots infested with compatible and incompatible pathogens was 31.7 and 30.9% (by plating), respectively and they were not significantly different (P = 0.67). The percentage of seedlots infested with null-interacting bacterial species was 16.8% (by plating) and it was significantly lower than the infested lots generated with compatible and incompatible bacterial pathogens (P = 0.03). None of the seedlots with incompatible/null-interacting bacteria developed symptoms on seedlings; however, when seedlings were assayed for epiphytic bacterial presence, 19.5 and 9.4% of the lots were positive, respectively. These results indicate that the seeds of non-host plants can become infested with incompatible and null-interacting bacterial species through flower colonization and they can be transmitted via epiphytic colonization of seedlings. In addition, it was also observed that flowers and seeds of non-host plants can be colonized by compatible/incompatible/null-interacting bacteria to higher populations; however, the level of colonization differed significantly depending on the type of bacterial species used."
https://openalex.org/W1976338345,"Follicular development occurs in wave like patterns in monotocous species such as cattle and humans and is regulated by a complex interaction of gonadotropins with local intrafollicular regulatory molecules. To further elucidate potential mechanisms controlling dominant follicle selection, granulosa cell RNA harvested from F1 (largest) and F2 (second largest) follicles isolated at predeviation (PD) and onset of diameter deviation (OD) stages of the first follicular wave was subjected to preliminary RNA transcriptome analysis. Expression of numerous WNT system components was observed. Hence experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that WNT signaling modulates FSH action on granulosa cells during follicular waves. Abundance of mRNA for WNT pathway members was evaluated in granulosa cells harvested from follicles at emergence (EM), PD, OD and early dominance (ED) stages of the first follicular wave. In F1 follicles, abundance of CTNNB1 and DVL1 mRNAs was higher and AXIN2 mRNA was lower at ED versus EM stages and DVL1 and FZD6 mRNAs were higher and AXIN2 mRNA was lower in F1 versus F2 follicle at the ED stage. Bovine granulosa cells were treated in vitro with increasing doses of the WNT inhibitor IWR-1+/- maximal stimulatory dose of FSH. IWR-1 treatment blocked the FSH-induced increase in granulosa cell numbers and reduced the FSH-induced increase in estradiol. Granulosa cells were also cultured in the presence or absence of FSH +/- IWR-1 and hormonal regulation of mRNA for WNT pathway members and known FSH targets determined. FSH treatment increased CYP19A1, CCND2, CTNNB1, AXIN2 and FZD6 mRNAs and the stimulatory effect on CYP19A1 mRNA was reduced by IWR-1. In contrast, FSH reduced CARTPT mRNA and IWR-1 partially reversed the inhibitory effect of FSH. Results support temporal and hormonal regulation and a potential role for WNT signaling in potentiating FSH action during dominant follicle selection."
https://openalex.org/W2060826192,"The α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the most abundant nAChR type in the brain, and this receptor type exists in alternate (α4β2)2α4 and (α4β2)2β2 forms, which are activated by agonists with strikingly differing efficacies. Recent breakthroughs have identified an additional operational agonist binding site in the (α4β2)2α4 nAChR that is responsible for the signature sensitivity of this receptor to activation by agonists, yet the structural mechanisms determining agonist efficacy at this receptor type are not yet fully understood. In this study, we characterized the ligand selectivity of the individual agonist sites of the (α4β2)2α4 nAChR to determine whether differences in agonist selectivity influence agonist efficacy. Applying the substituted cysteine accessibility method to individual agonist sites in concatenated (α4β2)2α4 receptors, we determined the agonist selectivity of the agonist sites of the (α4β2)2α4 receptor. We show that (a) accessibility of substituted cysteines to covalent modification by methanesulfonate reagent depends on the agonist site at which the modification occurs and (b) that agonists such as sazetidine-A and TC-2559 are excluded from the site at the α4/α4 interface. Given that additional binding to the agonist site in the α4/α4 interface increases acetylcholine efficacy and that agonists excluded from the agonist site at the α4/α4 interface behave as partial agonists, we conclude that the ability to engage all agonist sites in (α4β2)2α4 nAChRs is a key determinant of agonist efficacy. The findings add another level of complexity to the structural mechanisms that govern agonist efficacy in heteromeric nAChRs and related ligand-gated ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W2047533202,"Background In 1998 Libya experienced a major outbreak of multiple blood borne viral hepatitis and HIV infections. Since then, no studies have been done on the epidemic features and risk factors of HBV, HCV, HIV and co-infection among the general population. Methods A prospective study was carried out using a multi-centre clustering method to collect samples from the general population. The participants were interviewed, and relevant information was collected, including socio-demographic, ethnic, and geographic variables. This information was correlated with the risk factors involved in the transmission of HBV, HCV and HIV. Blood samples were collected and the sera were tested for HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HIV using enzyme immunoassay. Results A total of 9,170 participants from the nine districts of Tripoli were enrolled. The average prevalence of HBsAg was 3.7%, anti-HCV 0.9%, anti-HIV 0.15% and co-infection 0.02%. The prevalence varied from one district to another. HBV was more prevalent among those aged over 50 years and was associated with family history. Anti-HCV and anti-HIV were more prevalent among those aged 20–40 years. Intravenous drug use and blood transfusion were the main risk factors for HCV and HIV infection. Conclusion HBV, HCV, HIV and co-infection are relatively common in Libya. High prevalence was associated with geographic, ethnic and socioeconomic variability within the community. HCV and HIV infections among the younger age groups are becoming an alarming issue. Regulations and health care education need to be implemented and longer term follow-up should be planned."
https://openalex.org/W2023472994,"Introduction Biological samples, pharmaceuticals or food contain proteins, lipids, polymers, ammoniums and macromolecules that alter the detection of infectious agents by DNA amplification techniques (PCR). Moreover the targeted DNA has to be released from the complex cell walls and the compact nucleoprotein matrixes and cleared from potential inhibitors. The goal of the present work was to assess the efficiency of enzymatic pretreatments on infectious agents to make DNA available for further extraction and amplification. Methods Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Fusarium solani were mixed with an internal control virus and treated with: 1) proteinase K; 2) lyticase and 3) lyticase followed by proteinase K. DNAs was manually extracted using the QIAmp DNA Mini kit or the MagNA Pure Compact automate. DNA extraction yields and the inhibitors were assessed with a phocid Herpesvirus. Bacterial detection was performed using TaqMan real-time PCR and yeasts and filamentous Fungi with HRM (real-time PCR followed by high-resolution melting analysis). Results Viral DNA was released, extracted and detected using manual and automatic methods without pre enzymatic treatments. Either the manual or the automatic DNA extraction systems did not meet the sensitivity expectations if enzymatic treatments were not performed before: lyticase for Fungi and Proteinase K for Bacteria. The addition of lyticase and proteinase K did not improve results. For Fungi the detection after lyticase was higher than for Proteinase K, for which melting analysis did not allow fungal specification. Discussion Columns and magnetic beads allowed collecting DNA and separate PCR inhibitors. Detection rates cannot be related to DNA-avidity of beads or to elution but to the lack of proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1997146483,"PECAM-1 is a 130-kDa member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily that is expressed on the surface of platelets and leukocytes, and at the intracellular junctions of confluent endothelial cell monolayers. Previous studies have shown that PECAM-1/PECAM-1 homophilic interactions play a key role in leukocyte transendothelial migration, in allowing PECAM-1 to serve as a mechanosensory complex in endothelial cells, in its ability to confer cytoprotection to proapoptotic stimuli, and in maintaining endothelial cell junctional integrity. To examine the adhesive properties of full-length PECAM-1 in a native lipid environment, we purified it from platelets and assembled it into phospholipid nanodiscs. PECAM-1-containing nanodiscs retained not only their ability to bind homophilically to PECAM-1-expressing cells, but exhibited regulatable adhesive interactions that could be modulated by ligands that bind membrane- proximal Ig Domain 6. This property was exploited to enhance the rate of barrier restoration in endothelial cell monolayers subjected to inflammatory challenge. The finding that the adhesive properties of PECAM-1 are regulatable suggests novel approaches for controlling endothelial cell migration and barrier function in a variety of vascular permeability disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2028243683,"The REVEALS model is a tool for recalculating pollen data into vegetation abundances on a regional scale. We explored the general effect of selected parameters by performing simulations and ascertained the best model setting for the Czech Republic using the shallowest samples from 120 fossil sites and data on actual regional vegetation (60 km radius). Vegetation proportions of 17 taxa were obtained by combining the CORINE Land Cover map with forest inventories, agricultural statistics and habitat mapping data. Our simulation shows that changing the site radius for all taxa substantially affects REVEALS estimates of taxa with heavy or light pollen grains. Decreasing the site radius has a similar effect as increasing the wind speed parameter. However, adjusting the site radius to 1 m for local taxa only (even taxa with light pollen) yields lower, more correct estimates despite their high pollen signal. Increasing the background radius does not affect the estimates significantly. Our comparison of estimates with actual vegetation in seven regions shows that the most accurate relative pollen productivity estimates (PPEs) come from Central Europe and Southern Sweden. The initial simulation and pollen data yielded unrealistic estimates for Abies under the default setting of the wind speed parameter (3 m/s). We therefore propose the setting of 4 m/s, which corresponds to the spring average in most regions of the Czech Republic studied. Ad hoc adjustment of PPEs with this setting improves the match 3–4-fold. We consider these values (apart from four exceptions) to be appropriate, because they are within the ranges of standard errors, so they are related to original PPEs. Setting a 1 m radius for local taxa (Alnus, Salix, Poaceae) significantly improves the match between estimates and actual vegetation. However, further adjustments to PPEs exceed the ranges of original values, so their relevance is uncertain."
https://openalex.org/W2035843649,"A complex network is a useful tool for representing and analyzing complex systems, such as the world-wide web and transportation systems. However, the growing size of complex networks is becoming an obstacle to the understanding of the topological structure and their characteristics. In this study, a globally and locally adaptive network backbone (GLANB) extraction method is proposed. The GLANB method uses the involvement of links in shortest paths and a statistical hypothesis to evaluate the statistical importance of the links; then it extracts the backbone, based on the statistical importance, from the network by filtering the less important links and preserving the more important links; the result is an extracted subnetwork with fewer links and nodes. The GLANB determines the importance of the links by synthetically considering the topological structure, the weights of the links and the degrees of the nodes. The links that have a small weight but are important from the view of topological structure are not belittled. The GLANB method can be applied to all types of networks regardless of whether they are weighted or unweighted and regardless of whether they are directed or undirected. The experiments on four real networks show that the link importance distribution given by the GLANB method has a bimodal shape, which gives a robust classification of the links; moreover, the GLANB method tends to put the nodes that are identified as the core of the network by the k-shell algorithm into the backbone. This method can help us to understand the structure of the networks better, to determine what links are important for transferring information, and to express the network by a backbone easily."
https://openalex.org/W2051327337,"Background and Purpose In animal models, von Willebrand factor (VWF) is involved in thrombus formation and propagation of ischemic stroke. However, the pathophysiological relevance of this molecule in humans, and its potential use as a biomarker for the risk and severity of ischemic stroke remains unclear. This study had two aims: to identify predictors of altered VWF levels and to examine whether VWF levels differ between acute cerebrovascular events and chronic cerebrovascular disease (CCD). Methods A case–control study was undertaken between 2010 and 2013 at our University clinic. In total, 116 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or transitory ischemic attack (TIA), 117 patients with CCD, and 104 healthy volunteers (HV) were included. Blood was taken at days 0, 1, and 3 in patients with AIS or TIA, and once in CCD patients and HV. VWF serum levels were measured and correlated with demographic and clinical parameters by multivariate linear regression and ANOVA. Results Patients with CCD (158±46%) had significantly higher VWF levels than HV (113±36%, P<0.001), but lower levels than AIS/TIA patients (200±95%, P<0.001). Age, sex, and stroke severity influenced VWF levels (P<0.05). Conclusions VWF levels differed across disease subtypes and patient characteristics. Our study confirms increased VWF levels as a risk factor for cerebrovascular disease and, moreover, suggests that it may represent a potential biomarker for stroke severity, warranting further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2061279555,"In the present study, our aim was to compare physiological and behavioural responses to different noxious stimuli to those of a standardized innocuous stimulus, to possibly identify aversive responses indicative of injury detection in a commercially important marine teleost fish, the Atlantic cod. Individual fish were administered with a noxious stimulus to the lip under short-term general anaesthesia (MS-222). The noxious treatments included injection of 0.1% or 2% acetic acid, 0.005% or 0.1% capsaicin, or piercing the lip with a commercial fishing hook. Counts of opercular beat rate (OBR) at 10, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min and observations of behaviour at 30 and 90 min post-treatment were compared with pre-treatment values and with control fish injected with physiological saline, an innocuous stimulus. Circulatory levels of physiological stress indicators were determined in all fish at 120 minutes post-treatment. All treatments evoked temporarily increased OBR that returned to pre-treatment levels at 60 minutes (saline, 0.005% capsaicin, hook), 90 minutes (0.1% acetic acid, 0.1% capsaicin), or 120 minutes (2% acetic acid), but with no significant differences from the control group at any time point. Fish treated with 0.1% and 2% acetic acid and 0.1% capsaicin displayed increased hovering close to the bottom of the aquaria and fish given 2% acetic acid and 0.1% capsaicin also displayed a reduced use of shelter. The only effect seen in hooked fish was brief episodes of lateral head shaking which were not seen pre-treatment or in the other groups, possibly reflecting a resiliency to tissue damage in the mouth area related to the tough nature of the Atlantic cod diet. There were no differences between groups in circulatory stress indicators two hours after treatment. This study provides novel data on behavioural indicators that could be used to assess potentially aversive events in Atlantic cod."
https://openalex.org/W2070535531,"Apart from its canonical function in translation elongation, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) has been shown to interact with the actin cytoskeleton. Amino acid substitutions in eEF1A that reduce its ability to bind and bundle actin in vitro cause improper actin organization in vivo and reduce total translation. Initial in vivo analysis indicated the reduced translation was through initiation. The mutant strains exhibit increased levels of phosphorylated initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) dependent on the presence of the general control nonderepressible 2 (Gcn2p) protein kinase. Gcn2p causes down-regulation of total protein synthesis at initiation in response to increases in deacylated tRNA levels in the cell. Increased levels of eIF2α phosphorylation are not due to a general reduction in translation elongation as eEF2 and eEF3 mutants do not exhibit this effect. Deletion of GCN2 from the eEF1A actin bundling mutant strains revealed a second defect in translation. The eEF1A actin-bundling proteins exhibit changes in their elongation activity at the level of aminoacyl-tRNA binding in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2033897861,"The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii provides a tractable genetic model to study herbicide mode of action using forward genetics. The herbicide norflurazon inhibits phytoene desaturase, which is required for carotenoid synthesis. Locating amino acid substitutions in mutant phytoene desaturases conferring norflurazon resistance provides a genetic approach to map the herbicide binding site. We isolated a UV-induced mutant able to grow in very high concentrations of norflurazon (150 µM). The phytoene desaturase gene in the mutant strain contained the first resistance mutation to be localised to the dinucleotide-binding Rossmann-likedomain. A highly conserved phenylalanine amino acid at position 131 of the 564 amino acid precursor protein was changed to a valine in the mutant protein. F131, and two other amino acids whose substitution confers norflurazon resistance in homologous phytoene desaturase proteins, map to distant regions in the primary sequence of the C. reinhardtii protein (V472, L505) but in tertiary models these residues cluster together to a region close to the predicted FAD binding site. The mutant gene allowed direct 5 µM norflurazon based selection of transformants, which were tolerant to other bleaching herbicides including fluridone, flurtamone, and diflufenican but were more sensitive to beflubutamid than wild type cells. Norflurazon resistance and beflubutamid sensitivity allow either positive or negative selection against transformants expressing the mutant phytoene desaturase gene."

Heat-inactivated K37 (105, 107, and 109 CFU/mouse, day) were orally administered to OVA-sensitized BALB/c mice to investigate their effects on AHR, immunoglobulin (Ig) and cytokine production. The results showed that K37 dose-dependently lowered the serum levels of IgE, OVA-specific IgE and OVA-specific IgG1, ameliorated AHR induced by methacholine and suppressed eosinophil infiltration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The cytokine production in spleen cells culture and BALF showed that K37 drove the immune responses toward T-helper cell type 1 (Th1) responses, elevated levels of IL-2 and IFN-γ, and reduced of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. K37 also improved cell infiltration in lung sections. Our results demonstrated that oral administration of K37 alleviated effectively the allergic responses in vivo. Thus, K37 can be a good source material and a promising candidate for prophylactic and therapeutic treatments of allergic diseases, like asthma."

Marine shells identified far from the shore evidence long-distance transport and imply networks of exchange and negotiation. However, worked beads lose taxonomic clues to identification, and this may be compounded by taphonomic alteration. Consequently, the significance of this key early artefact may be underestimated. We report the use of bulk amino acid composition of the stable intra-crystalline proteins preserved in shell biominerals and the application of pattern recognition methods to a large dataset (777 samples) to demonstrate that taxonomic identification can be achieved at genus level. Amino acid analyses are fast (<2 hours per sample) and micro-destructive (sample size <2 mg). Their integration with non-destructive techniques provides a valuable and affordable tool, which can be used by archaeologists and museum curators to gain insight into early exploitation of natural resources by humans. Here we combine amino acid analyses, macro- and microstructural observations (by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy) and Raman spectroscopy to try to identify the raw material used for beads discovered at the Early Bronze Age site of Great Cornard (UK). Our results show that at least two shell taxa were used and we hypothesise that these were sourced locally."
https://openalex.org/W1975249005,"A reoccurring conservation problem is the resolution of consumptive use of threatened wildlife and is especially difficult to defend when it occurs for recreational practices. We explored the commercial capture and supply of threatened European river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) to anglers, to determine the extent of exploitation and seek opportunities for improved conservation. The trade began in 1995 from England, but by 2012 involved sale of lamprey from England, The Netherlands and Estonia, including from protected populations. Lamprey are sold frozen for the capture of predatory fish, mostly in freshwater. In the year 2011/2012 9 tonnes (>90,000 lampreys) of river lamprey were supplied, almost exclusively to British anglers. Although annual catches in the main English lamprey fishery (River Ouse) have varied widely since 1995, catch per unit effort did not decline between 2000 and 2012. Conservation actions since 2011 have included a cap on fishing licenses, catch quotas and restricted fishing seasons. Now, 86% of lamprey bait is imported to Britain. Most bait sellers interviewed would not stock lamprey if they knew they were from threatened populations; many felt their trade would not be impacted if lamprey were not stocked. This facilitates opportunities to enter into dialogue with anglers over alternative baits to threatened lamprey. The study emphasises the need to inform stakeholders about conservation species subjected to market-driven exploitation."

The presence of lens opacity was examined by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and evaluated according to LOCS II standard photographs. The subtype of cataract present, including nuclear, cortical, posterior subcapsular, and anterior polar cataracts, was noted. Multivariable adjusted logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for association of each specific type of cataract with age, sex, health examination, and medical history.The prevalence of nuclear, cortical, and posterior subcapsular cataract increased gradually with increasing age. However, the prevalence of APC peaked in the 50- to 59-year-old subjects. All types of cataract except for APCs were more prevalent in women. Oral steroid use was associated with a lower risk of APC.These findings showed the unique characteristics of APC in the Korean population."

These cells might have an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC). The interaction of chemokine ligand 25 (CCL25) with chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9) is involved in gut-specific migration of leukocytes and induces regulatory T cells (Tregs) to migrate to the intestine in chronic ileitis.In UC patients, NKT receptor CD161, CCL25, and CCR9 expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR. A murine model of oxazolone-induced colitis was induced in BALB/c mice. The mRNA levels of NK1.1, CCL25 and CCR9, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice were evaluated. The CCR9 expression on Type I or invariant NKT (iNKT) cells, and the iNKT cells chemotaxis are observed according to flow cytometry. NKT receptor CD161, CCL25 and CCR9 expression levels were significantly increased in UC patients. And, the mRNA expression levels of NK1.1, CCL25 and CCR9 were increased in oxazolone-induced colitis in mice. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was significantly increased, especially interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-10 and IL-13. We observed significantly increased CCR9 expression on iNKT cells. Furthermore, we found an increased iNKT population and enhanced chemotaxis during oxazolone-induced colitis.Our study suggests that CCL25/CCR9 interactions may promote the induction and function of iNKT cells during oxazolone-induced colitis.

In this study, we investigated the in vivo extracellular kinetics of boronophenylalanine-fructose (BPA-f) in glioma-bearing rats with FUS-induced BBB disruption by microdialysis. After simultaneous intravenous administration of BPA and FUS exposure, the boron concentration in the treated brains was quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. With FUS, the mean peak concentration of BPA-f in the glioma dialysate was 3.6 times greater than without FUS, and the area under the concentration-time curve was 2.1 times greater.

We established pre- and post-operative nomograms estimating biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free probability after RP in Korean men with clinically localized PCa. Patients and Methods Our sampling frame included 3,034 consecutive men with clinically localized PCa who underwent RP at our tertiary centers from June 2004 through July 2011. After inappropriate data exclusion, we evaluated 2,867 patients for the development of nomograms. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to develop pre- and post-operative nomograms that predict BCR-free probability. Finally, we resampled from our study cohort 200 times to determine the accuracy of our nomograms on internal validation, which were designated with concordance index (c-index) and further represented by calibration plots. Results Over a median of 47 months of follow-up, the estimated BCR-free rate was 87.8% (1 year), 83.8% (2 year), and 72.5% (5 year). In the pre-operative model, Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA), the proportion of positive biopsy cores, clinical T3a and biopsy Gleason score (GS) were independent predictive factors for BCR, while all relevant predictive factors (PSA, extra-prostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node metastasis, surgical margin, and pathologic GS) were associated with BCR in the post-operative model. The c-index representing predictive accuracy was 0.792 (pre-) and 0.821 (post-operative), showing good fit in the calibration plots. Conclusions In summary, we developed pre- and post-operative nomograms predicting BCR-free probability after RP in a large Korean cohort with clinically localized PCa. These nomograms will be provided as the mobile application-based SNUH Prostate Cancer Calculator. Our nomograms can determine patients at high risk of disease recurrence after RP who will benefit from adjuvant therapy."

The robustness of the method is tested by utilizing repeated copies of tiled probes. The method shows high consistency between experiments that used the same samples, but different probe layout. There also is statistically significant consistency when comparing experiments with different samples. The method selected the long non-coding ribonucleic acid PCNCR1 in all three experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2007667032,"Nonsimultaneous maskers can strongly impair performance in an auditory intensity discrimination task. Using methods of molecular psychophysics, we quantified the extent to which (1) a masker-induced impairment of the representation of target intensity (i.e., increase in internal noise) and (2) a systematic influence of the masker intensities on the decision variable contribute to these effects. In a two-interval intensity discrimination procedure, targets were presented in quiet, and combined with forward maskers. The lateralization of the maskers relative to the targets was varied via the interaural time difference. Intensity difference limens (DLs) were strongly elevated under forward masking but less with contralateral than with ipsilateral maskers. For most listeners and conditions, perceptual weights measuring the relation between the target and masker levels and the response in the intensity discrimination task were positive and significant. Higher perceptual weights assigned to the maskers corresponded to stronger elevations of the intensity DL. The maskers caused only a weak increase in internal noise, unrelated to target level and masker lateralization. The results indicate that the effects of forward masking on intensity discrimination are determined by an inclusion of the masker intensities in the decision variable, compatible with the hypothesis that the impairment in performance is to a large part caused by difficulties in directing selective attention to the targets. The effects of masker lateralization are evidence for top-down influences, and the observed positive signs of the masker weights suggest that the relevant mechanisms are located at higher processing stages rather than in the auditory periphery."
https://openalex.org/W2020446954,"Mycotoxin induced hepatoxocity has been linked to oxidative stress, resulting from either an increase in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) above normal levels and/or the suppression of antioxidant protective pathways. However, few detailed molecular studies of mycotoxicoses in animals have been carried out. This study use current RNA-seq based approaches to investigate the effects of mycotoxin exposure in a ruminant model. Having first assembled a de novo reference transcriptome, we use RNA-Seq technology to define in vivo hepatic gene expression changes resulting from mycotoxin exposure in relationship to pathological effect. As expected, characteristic oxidative stress related gene expression is markedly different in animals exhibiting poorer outcomes. However, expression of multiple genes critical for detoxification, particularly members of the cytochrome P450 gene family, was significantly higher in animals exhibiting mycotoxin tolerance (‘resistance’). Further, we present novel evidence for the amplification of Wnt signalling pathway activity in ‘resistant’ animals, resulting from the marked suppression of multiple key Wnt inhibitor genes. Notably, ‘resistance’ may be determined primarily by the ability of an individual to detoxify secondary metabolites generated by the metabolism of mycotoxins and the potentiation of Wnt signalling may be pivotal to achieving a favourable outcome upon challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2032372402,"Genetic recombination is a major contributor to the ongoing diversification of HIV. It is clearly apparent that across the HIV-genome there are defined recombination hot and cold spots which tend to co-localise both with genomic secondary structures and with either inter-gene boundaries or intra-gene domain boundaries. There is also good evidence that most recombination breakpoints that are detectable within the genes of natural HIV recombinants are likely to be minimally disruptive of intra-protein amino acid contacts and that these breakpoints should therefore have little impact on protein folding. Here we further investigate the impact on patterns of genetic recombination in HIV of selection favouring the maintenance of functional RNA and protein structures. We confirm that chimaeric Gag p24, reverse transcriptase, integrase, gp120 and Nef proteins that are expressed by natural HIV-1 recombinants have significantly lower degrees of predicted folding disruption than randomly generated recombinants. Similarly, we use a novel single-stranded RNA folding disruption test to show that there is significant, albeit weak, evidence that natural HIV recombinants tend to have genomic secondary structures that more closely resemble parental structures than do randomly generated recombinants. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that natural selection has acted both in the short term to purge recombinants with disrupted RNA and protein folds, and in the longer term to modify the genome architecture of HIV to ensure that recombination prone sites correspond with those where recombination will be minimally deleterious."

This dynamic process is incompletely understood, more so when considering that each specific α/β integrin heterodimer or distinctly differentiated subset of activated lymphocytes may use a unique combination of interacting proteins to regulate each of these adhesive events (7.Zaidel-Bar R.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is part of the outside-in signaling cascade initiated by integrin-mediated adhesion (8.Ramos J.W. The regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in mammalian cells.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 2707-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The highly conserved Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling module relays signals from the extracellular membrane to cellular effectors that regulate cell fate by influencing cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and motility (9.Chang L. Karin M. Mammalian MAP kinase signaling cascades.Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4392) Google Scholar). Receptor stimulation activates Ras family small GTPases, subsequently recruiting RAF family kinases to the plasma membrane for activation. Activated RAF then binds and activates MEK to bind and activate ERK, which then translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription factor complexes. The RAF family of serine/threonine protein kinases consists of A-Raf, B-Raf, and C-Raf (Raf-1), which share a common modular structure and some binding partners but are unique in many aspects (10.Wellbrock C.

However, our understanding of the role of MAPK in the regulation of lymphocyte adhesion or the direct regulation of integrin activity is still limited. We set out to study secondary roles of the MAPK pathway members as regulators of integrin function in T cells. Inhibition of RAF but not MEK/ERK reduces the adhesion of Jurkat T cells to VCAM-1 under shear stress, demonstrating the independence of this function from downstream signaling of the MAPK pathway. shRNA-mediated knockdown of B-Raf reproduced the effect of chemical RAF inhibition, confirming a role for B-Raf in lymphocyte adhesion. The human T cell line, Jurkat, was cultured in complete medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Human fibronectin was purified from plasma (Gulf Coast Blood Center, Houston, TX) as described (20.Wooten D.K. Teague T.K. McIntyre B.W. Separation of integrin-dependent adhesion from morphological changes based on differential PLC specificities.J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 65: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Normal human T cells were negatively selected from healthy donors (Gulf Coast Blood Center, Houston, TX) using the RosetteSep Human T-cell enrichment mixture (Stemcell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, Canada) and then maintained in complete medium supplemented with human recombinant IL-2 (20 units/ml), anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml), and anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml). Human VCAM-1 was purified from the supernatant of CHO cells engineered to express soluble VCAM-1-Fc (21.Woodside D.G. Kram R.M. Mitchell J.S. Belsom T. Billard M.J. McIntyre B.W. Vanderslice P.

AlexaFluor- and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, nonspecific rabbit and mouse IgGs, and mouse anti-GM1 were purchased (Invitrogen).

Doxycycline, puromycin, saponin, U0126 (Sigma-Aldrich), recombinant human ICAM-1/Fc (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and sorafenib (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) were purchased. Knockdown cells were generated using shRNA-pTRIPZ clones (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL). Lentivirus was generated by Lipofectamine 2000 transfection of the packaging cell line, 293T-METR, with packaging plasmids containing pΔR8.91, CMV-pVSVG, and either scrambled non-silencing controls or a BRAF targeting sequence. Viral supernatants were collected at 48 h and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. Jurkat cells (1 × 106) were transduced and then selected in medium containing puromycin (1 μg/ml). After 1 week, cells were divided into a no treatment group and a doxycycline (1 μg/ml)-treated group. After 72 h, doxycycline-induced fluorescent red (TurboRFP) cells were purified with a FACS Aria IIu high-speed cell sorter (BD Biosciences) and cultured in complete medium with doxycycline. The detachment assay was performed as described (26.Mitchell J.S. Brown W.S. Woodside D.G. Vanderslice P. McIntyre B.W.

In brief, human FN (5 μg/ml), VCAM-1 (10 μg/ml), or mAbs (1 μg/ml) were immobilized to plastic slides, washed with PBS, blocked with 2% BSA in PBS, and assembled to a parallel plate flow chamber. Cells (4 × 106) in running buffer (10 mm Tris, 103 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 5.5 mm glucose, 5.4 mm KCl, and 0.2% BSA, pH 7.4) were injected into the flow chamber and allowed to settle on the slide for 10 min. A computer-controlled syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus) was used to apply an increasing linear gradient of fluid flow to the cells for 300 s and recorded by digital microscopy. Shear stress calculations were determined every 50 s, and the shear stress in dynes/cm2 was defined as (6μQ)/(wh2), where μ is the viscosity of the medium (0.007), Q is the flow rate in cm3/s, w is the width of the chamber (0.3175 cm), and h is the height of the chamber (0.0254 cm). Human VCAM-1 was immobilized to 6-well non-tissue culture-treated plates (Falcon), washed with PBS, and blocked with 2% BSA in PBS. Cells (1 × 106) in complete medium were added, incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Images were captured at ×20 magnification using a Nikon Diaphot-TMD microscope, equipped with a VI-470 CCD video camera (Optronics Engineering). Images were analyzed using Slidebook software (version 5.0) to distinguish spread cells from non-spread cells by creating a mask of spread cells and counting all cells that were larger or smaller than the threshold. Human VCAM-1 (10 μg/ml) was immobilized to glass coverslips, washed with PBS, and blocked with 2% BSA in PBS. Cells (5 × 105) in complete medium were added and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized by adding saponin to a concentration of 0.1% for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS, 2% BSA, 0.1% saponin, stained for total B-Raf (AlexaFluor 647) and β1 integrin (AlexaFluor 488), and mounted to slides using Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired at room temperature using the OMX Blaze V4 structured illumination microscope (Applied Precision) with a ×100 numerical aperture 1.40 objective lens, two EM-CCD Photometrics Evolve 512 cameras, and DeltaVision OMX acquisition software. The images were reconstructed and rotated in three dimensions by 90°, and the height of cells was measured using the softWoRx software (version 6.0 beta 19). The image stacks were then transferred to either Slidebook software (version 5.0) to measure the area of contact of the cell with the glass coverslip or Imaris Bitplane software (version 7.6.1) to measure the colocalization of β1 integrin and B-Raf. The colocalization was quantified from the reconstructed three-dimensional image using the spot detection function for absolute fluorescence of both β1 integrin and B-Raf channels. Spots were generated with a 200-nm maximum xy diameter and a 500-nm maximum z diameter, identifying between 2000 and 15,000 spots for each channel per reconstructed image. Then the spots-to-spots colocalization function was used to identify all spots within 300 nm of spots from the other channel. The soluble VCAM-1 binding assay was modified from a previous procedure (27.Rose D.M. Grabovsky V. Alon R. Ginsberg M.H. The affinity of integrin α4β1 governs lymphocyte migration.J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2824-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In brief, cells (1 × 106) in 100 μl of serum-free medium were incubated with human VCAM-1-Fc (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were then diluted and fixed by adding 2 ml of RPMI 1640 with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with 2% BSA in PBS and incubated with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The quantification of integrin-cytoskeleton attachment was modified from a previous procedure (26.Mitchell J.S. Brown W.S. Woodside D.G. Vanderslice P. McIntyre B.W.

Association of various T cell-surface molecules with the cytoskeleton: effect of cross-linking and activation.J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3298-3305PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 106) in 100 μl of complete medium were incubated with mAb (1 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 30 min, and then either they were left untreated or AlexaFluor-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse was added at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were incubated at either 4 or 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were then washed and resuspended in cytoskeletal stabilizing buffer (50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl, 0.22 mm EGTA, 13 mm Tris, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm iodacetamide, and 2% FBS, pH 8.0) with or without 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After 5 min at room temperature, 1 ml of cytoskeletal stabilizing buffer was added, and cells were immediately pelleted and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed three times in PBS, and the amount of remaining bound mAb was determined by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). The parallel plate flow assay was used to measure adhesion and investigate the role of ERK signaling in integrin-mediated adhesion to human FN under conditions of shear stress. Two inhibitors of the ERK pathway were used, U0126, a MEK inhibitor, and sorafenib, a RAF inhibitor. Jurkat cell adhesion to FN was unchanged by 1 h of 1 μm U0126 treatment (Fig. 1A). The U0126- and vehicle (DMSO)-treated cells show very similar rates of detachment, with ∼49% of the initial cells remaining at 45 dynes/cm2 (maximum shear) (Fig. 1B). The phosphorylation of ERK was inhibited in these cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast to MEK/ERK inhibition, adhesion to FN was significantly reduced by 50 nm sorafenib when compared with vehicle control (MeOH) (Fig. 1D). The cells pretreated with vehicle show 47.5% of cells remaining at maximum shear, whereas the cells pretreated with sorafenib show an increased rate of detachment with only 11.9% of cells remaining, a 75% inhibition (Fig. 1E). The phosphorylation of B-Raf was inhibited by 50 nm sorafenib (Fig. 1F). These results suggest that RAF, and not MEK/ERK, contributes to T cell resistance to shear stress after adhesion to FN. Both α5β1 and α4β1 integrin bind FN, so to address the specificity of the adhesion, we tested adhesion to VCAM-1, which is a ligand for α4β1 and not α5β1. Adhesion to VCAM-1 was unchanged by 1 h of 1 μm U0126 treatment (Fig. 2A). The U0126- and vehicle (DMSO)-treated cells show very similar rates of detachment to VCAM-1, with ∼40% of cells remaining at maximum shear (Fig. 2B). The phosphorylation of ERK was inhibited in these cells (Fig. 2C). However, adhesion to VCAM-1 was reduced by 50 nm sorafenib (Fig. 2D). The cells pretreated with either vehicle or 10 nm sorafenib show very similar rates of detachment to VCAM-1, with ∼65% of the initial cells remaining at maximum shear, whereas the cells pretreated with 50 nm sorafenib show an increased rate of detachment with only 29.1% of the initial cells remaining, a 57% inhibition (Fig. 1E). The phosphorylation of B-Raf was inhibited at the 50 nm concentration of sorafenib (Fig. 2F). Sorafenib is most specific for Raf-1 (6 nm IC50) and B-Raf (22 nm IC50) (29.Wilhelm S.M. Carter C. Tang L. Wilkie D. McNabola A. Rong H. Chen C. Zhang X. Vincent P. McHugh M. Cao Y. Shujath J. Gawlak S. Eveleigh D. Rowley B. Liu L. Adnane L. Lynch M. Auclair D. Taylor I. Gedrich R. Voznesensky A.

BAY 43–9006 exhibits broad spectrum oral antitumor activity and targets the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and receptor tyrosine kinases involved in tumor progression and angiogenesis.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7099-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (3536) Google Scholar), and combined, these data suggest that B-Raf phosphorylation contributes to α4β1 integrin-mediated adhesion to VCAM-1. Given the reported differences between Jurkat and non-transformed T cells, we investigated the response of normal human T cells to sorafenib under conditions of shear stress after adhesion to α4β1 integrin ligands. Adhesion to both VCAM-1 (Fig. 3A) and FN (Fig. 3B) was significantly reduced by 50 nm sorafenib, compared with MeOH vehicle control. Three healthy donors were tested, and these results demonstrate that sorafenib reduces adhesion of normal human T cells to α4β1 integrin ligands. To confirm the role of B-Raf in α4β1 integrin-mediated adhesion, Jurkat cells were stably transduced with doxycycline-inducible shRNA specific for BRAF or a scrambled shRNA vector control sequence. B-Raf protein expression was reduced in the B-Raf knockdown (KD) cells cultured with doxycycline (Fig. 4A). B-Raf knockdown cells (KD+D) compared with control cells (KD-NT, VC-NT, and VC+D) show decreased adhesion to both VCAM-1 (Fig. 4B) and FN (Fig. 4C). The control cells show very similar rates of detachment to VCAM-1, with ∼55% of the initial cells remaining at maximum shear, whereas the KD+D cells show an increased rate of detachment with only 4.9% of the initial cells remaining (Fig. 4D). Similarly, with FN, the control cells show equal rates of detachment, with ∼36% of the initial cells remaining at maximum shear, whereas the KD+D cells show an increased rate of detachment, with only 7.4% of the initial cells remaining (Fig. 4E). These results demonstrate that knockdown of B-Raf leads to decreased adhesion to α4β1 integrin ligands. A reduction in viability or α4β1 integrin expression of B-Raf knockdown cells could account for decreased adhesion. To confirm that B-Raf knockdown did not produce a defect in cell viability, the proliferation of the transduced or control cells cultured with or without doxycycline was measured for 10 days and found to remain unchanged (Fig. 5A). To confirm that B-Raf knockdown does not lead to reduced surface expression of integrin subunits, α4 or β1 integrin subunits were measured by flow cytometry and were unchanged (Fig. 5B). Thus, the decreased adhesion observed under conditions of B-Raf knockdown is not due to reduced viability or α4β1 integrin expression. Another mechanism of regulating the adhesion strength of integrins is the modulation of binding affinity. To test the role of B-Raf in the regulation of α4β1 integrin affinity, the binding affinity for soluble VCAM-1 was measured and found to be unchanged by pretreatment with 50 nm sorafenib (Fig. 5C) or by B-Raf knockdown (Fig. 5D). Cells were incubated with Mn2+ as a positive control for maximal integrin affinity, and the binding affinity for VCAM-1 of cells incubated with 1 mm Mn2+ was increased over the cells that did not receive Mn2+ but unchanged by B-Raf knockdown or sorafenib, indicating that the ability of the integrin to achieve a maximal affinity conformation is unaffected. These results indicate that B-Raf is unessential to α4β1 integrin affinity for soluble VCAM-1, and the reduced adhesion is not due to affinity regulation of α4β1. The fact that α4β1 affinity was shown to be unaffected suggested that we could bypass physiologic ligand coupling by using adhesion to immobilized mAbs to address the specificity of B-Raf inhibition on resistance to shear stress. Jurkat cell adhesion to an anti-α4β1 integrin mAb (19H8) was significantly reduced by 50 nm sorafenib when compared with vehicle control, whereas adhesion to an anti-CD28 mAb was unchanged by sorafenib (Fig. 6A). Adhesion was measured to mAbs to α4β1 integrin (19H8), β1 integrin (33B6), α5 integrin, LFA-1 (32E6 and MHM24), CD28, GM1, CD43, CD59, CD3 (OKT3), and CD4 (OKT4) (Fig. 6B). Adhesion was only reduced by sorafenib to α4β1 or β1 integrin mAbs. Adhesion was also measured to the LFA-1 natural ligand ICAM-1 and found to be unaffected by sorafenib (Fig. 6B). The shRNA vector control cells (VC+D) and B-Raf knockdown cells (KD+D) show equal detachment when bound to immobilized anti-LFA-1 (32E6), anti-CD3 (OKT3), and ICAM-1 (Fig. 6C). However, the adhesion of B-Raf knockdown cells to the anti-α4β1 integrin mAb (19H8) was significantly reduced when compared with shRNA vector control cells (Fig. 6C). These results indicate that B-Raf specifically regulates α4β1 integrin and not other integrins or a variety of membrane components. Bright field microscopy was used to investigate the effects of RAF inhibition on cell morphology after adhesion to VCAM-1. Images were captured and quantified after 10 min of adhesion to VCAM-1 (Fig. 7A). An average of 84.4% of MeOH vehicle-treated cells were spread, compared with 9% of cells treated with 50 nm sorafenib (Fig. 7B). Similarly, an average of 77.3% of shRNA vector control cells (VC+D) were spread, compared with 7.9% of B-Raf knockdown cells (KD+D) (Fig. 7C). These results demonstrate that B-Raf activity or expression is required for efficient α4β1 integrin-driven cell spreading. Super-resolution microscopy was used to investigate RAF inhibition on cell morphology and localization of β1 integrin and B-Raf after 10-min adhesion to VCAM-1. Cell spreading after pretreatment with 50 nm sorafenib was measured using the height of cells (Fig. 8A) and the area of cellular contact with the glass coverslip (Fig. 8B) as indicators of spreading. The average height of cells pretreated with vehicle control (MeOH) was 5.5 μm, whereas the average height of cells pretreated with sorafenib was 10.2 μm (Fig. 8C). The average area of cellular contact with VCAM-1 of control cells was 512 μm2, whereas the average with sorafenib was 110 μm2, a 78.4% reduction (Fig. 8D). The colocalization of β1 integrin and B-Raf was quantified from reconstructed three-dimensional images using the spots generated from absolute fluorescence (Fig. 8E). The control cells had 31.6% of β1 integrin colocalize with B-Raf, and the cells pretreated with sorafenib had only 13.3% of β1 integrin colocalize with B-Raf, a 58% reduction (Fig. 8F). A trend was observed in the decreased amount of B-Raf to colocalize with β1 integrin in sorafenib-treated cells, but it failed to reach significance (Fig. 8G). These results demonstrate that sorafenib inhibits cell spreading on VCAM-1 and reduces β1 integrin colocalization with B-Raf after adhesion to VCAM-1. Integrin association with the actin cytoskeleton increases post-ligand binding and is necessary for focal adhesion formation and cellular resistance to shear stress. It has been shown that antibody cross-linking of α4 integrin on Jurkat cells leads to a significant increase in the amount of anti-α4 mAb able to resist solubilization by a non-ionic detergent, and this is interpreted to result from an increase in α4 integrin association with the cytoskeleton (30.Alon R.

https://openalex.org/W2082891611,"ChIP-seq has become a major tool for the genome-wide identification of transcription factor binding or histone modification sites. Most peak-calling algorithms require input control datasets to model the occurrence of background reads to account for local sequencing and GC bias. However, the GC-content of reads in Input-seq datasets deviates significantly from that in ChIP-seq datasets. Moreover, we observed that a commonly used peak calling program performed equally well when the use of a simulated uniform background set was compared to an Input-seq dataset. This contradicts the assumption that input control datasets are necessary to fatefully reflect the background read distribution. Because the GC-content of the abundant single reads in ChIP-seq datasets is similar to those of randomly sampled regions we designed a peak-calling algorithm with a background model based on overlapping single reads. The application, OccuPeak, uses the abundant low frequency tags present in each ChIP-seq dataset to model the background, thereby avoiding the need for additional datasets. Analysis of the performance of OccuPeak showed robust model parameters. Its measure of peak significance, the excess ratio, is only dependent on the tag density of a peak and the global noise levels. Compared to the commonly used peak-calling applications MACS and CisGenome, OccuPeak had the highest sensitivity in an enhancer identification benchmark test, and performed similar in an overlap tests of transcription factor occupation with DNase I hypersensitive sites and H3K27ac sites. Moreover, peaks called by OccuPeak were significantly enriched with cardiac disease-associated SNPs. OccuPeak runs as a standalone application and does not require extensive tweaking of parameters, making its use straightforward and user friendly. Availability: http://occupeak.hfrc.nl"
https://openalex.org/W2031180143,"Mechanical factors such as stretch are thought to be important in the regulation of muscle phenotype. Small muscle protein X-linked (SMPX) is upregulated by stretch in skeletal muscle and has been suggested to serve both as a transcription factor and a mechanosensor, possibly giving rise to changes in both fiber size and fiber type. We have used in vivo confocal imaging to study the subcellular localization of SMPX in skeletal muscle fibers of adult rats using a SMPX-EGFP fusion protein. The fusion protein was localized predominantly in repetitive double stripes flanking the Z-disc, and was excluded from all nuclei. This localization would be consistent with SMPX being a mechanoreceptor, but not with SMPX playing a role as a transcription factor. In vivo overexpression of ectopic SMPX in skeletal muscle of adult mice gave no significant changes in fiber type distribution or cross sectional area, thus a role of SMPX in regulating muscle phenotype remains unclear."
https://openalex.org/W2163184016,"The effects of scopolamine on memory consolidation are controversial and depend on several factors (i.e. site of administration, time of administration and testing, dose, cognitive task, experimental protocol, specie, strain, etc.). Generally, the range dose of systemic administered scopolamine, used in memory consolidation studies, has varied from 0.05 to 50 mg/kg. However, according to the literature, the most frequently used doses of scopolamine efficient on memory consolidation, are 1 and 30 mg/kg, low and high doses, respectively. In open field habituation studies only lower doses of scopolamine were used to test memory consolidation. Therefore, in the present study we compared the effects of low (1 mg/kg) and high (30 mg/kg) scopolamine dose, on the open field habituation task, in male Wistar rats. Scopolamine was administered immediately after the acquisition task and animals were retested 48 h later on. On the retested day, the ambulation and rearing in the open field decreased in the same manner in all tested groups. In saline- and 1 mg/kg scopolamine-treated animals, the time spent in grooming significantly decreased in the habituation task, while the same parameter significantly increased in animals treated with 30 mg/kg of scopolamine. The defecation rate significantly decreased (control group), maintained (1 mg/kg of scopolamine treated animals) or significantly increased (30 mg/kg of scopolamine treated group) on retention test. In conclusion, the present data suggest that post-training scopolamine administration does not affect locomotion neither exploration in the habituation to a novel environment, but increases defecation and grooming, two behaviours associated with fearful and stressful situations."
https://openalex.org/W2151940245,"Tropical rain forests, the richest terrestrial ecosystems in biodiversity on Earth are highly threatened by global changes. This paper aims to infer the mechanisms governing species tree assemblages by characterizing the phylogenetic structure of a tropical rain forest in a protected area of the Congo Basin, the Dja Faunal Reserve (Cameroon). We re-analyzed a dataset of 11538 individuals belonging to 372 taxa found along nine transects spanning five habitat types. We generated a dated phylogenetic tree including all sampled taxa to partition the phylogenetic diversity of the nine transects into alpha and beta components at the level of the transects and of the habitat types. The variation in phylogenetic composition among transects did not deviate from a random pattern at the scale of the Dja Faunal Reserve, probably due to a common history and weak environmental variation across the park. This lack of phylogenetic structure combined with an isolation-by-distance pattern of taxonomic diversity suggests that neutral dispersal limitation is a major driver of community assembly in the Dja. To assess any lack of sensitivity to the variation in habitat types, we restricted the analyses of transects to the terra firme primary forest and found results consistent with those of the whole dataset at the level of the transects. Additionally to previous analyses, we detected a weak but significant phylogenetic turnover among habitat types, suggesting that species sort in varying environments, even though it is not predominating on the overall phylogenetic structure. Finer analyses of clades indicated a signal of clustering for species from the Annonaceae family, while species from the Apocynaceae family indicated overdispersion. These results can contribute to the conservation of the park by improving our understanding of the processes dictating community assembly in these hyperdiverse but threatened regions of the world."
https://openalex.org/W1997422212,"As function units, network motifs have been detected to reveal evolutionary mechanisms of complex systems, such as biological networks, food webs, engineering networks and social networks. However, emergence of motifs in growing networks may be problematic due to large fluctuation of subgraph frequency in the initial stage. This paper contributes to present a method which can identify the emergence of motif in growing networks. Based on the Erdös-Rényi(E-R) random null model, the variation rate of expected frequency of subgraph at adjacent time points was used to define the suitable detection range for motif identification. Upper and lower boundaries of the range were obtained in analytical form according to a chosen risk level. Then, the statistical metric Z-score was extended to a new one,, which effectively reveals the statistical significance of subgraph in a continuous period of time. In this paper, a novel research framework of motif identification was proposed, defining critical boundaries for the evolutionary process of networks and a significance metric of time scale. Finally, an industrial ecosystem at Kalundborg was adopted as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and convenience of the proposed methodology."
https://openalex.org/W2033006897,"Foamy cells have been described in various infectious diseases, for example in actinomycetoma induced by Nocardia brasiliensis. These cells are generally considered to be macrophages, although they present dendritic cell (DC)-specific surface markers. In this study, we determined and confirmed the lineage of possible precursors of foamy cells in vitro and in vivo using an experimental actinomycetoma model in BALB/c mice. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) or DC (BMDC) were infected in vitro with N. brasiliensis or labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE). Both, macrophages and DC, differentiated into foamy cells after in vitro infection. CFSE-labeled BMDM or BMDC were tested for phagocytosis and CD11c/CD11b receptors markers expression before being transferred into the actinomycetoma lesion site of infected mice. In vivo studies showed that BMDM and BMDC were traced at the site where foamy cells are present in the experimental actinomycetoma. Interestingly, many of the transferred BMDM and BMDC were stained with the lipid-droplet fluorophore Nile Red. In conclusion, macrophages and DC cells can be differentiated into foamy cells in vitro and in vivo during N. brasiliensis infection."
https://openalex.org/W2024642316,"Background Acute coronary artery diseases have been observed to be associated with some meteorological variables. But few of the previous studies considered autocorrelated outcomes. Electrocardiography is a widely used tool in the initial diagnosis of acute cardiovascular events, and emergency electrocardiography counts were shown to be highly correlated with acute myocardial infarction in our pilot study, hence a good index of prediction for acute cardiovascular events morbidity among the elderly. To indirectly assess the impact of temperature on the number of acute cardiovascular events, we studied the association between temperature and emergency electrocardiography counts while considering autocorrelated nature of the response variables. Methods We collected daily emergency electrocardiography counts for elderly females and males in Shanghai from 2007 to middle 2012, and studied temperature and other effects on these data using Mixed Generalized Additive Modelling methods. Delayed temperature effect distribution was described as the weighted average of the temperatures within 3 days before the counts was recorded. Autoregressive random effects were used in the model to describe the autocorrelation of the response variables. Main Results Temperature effect was observed to be piecewise linearly associated with the logarithm of emergency electrocardiography counts. The optimal weights of the delayed temperature effect distribution were obtained from the model estimation. The weights of lag-1 were the maximums, significantly greater than the weights of lag-2 and lag-3 for both females and males. The model showed good fit with R2 values of 0.860 for females and 0.856 for males. Conclusion From the mixed generalized additive model, we infer that during cold and mild days, the number of emergency electrocardiography counts increase as temperature effect decreases, while during hot days, counts increase as temperature effect increases. Similar properties could be inferred for the occurrence of cardiovascular events."
https://openalex.org/W2072634080,"Breast cancer is a common malignant tumor, which severely threatens the health of women with an increasing incidence in many countries. Here, we identified C10orf10 as a novel differentially expression gene using expression microarray screening. The expression analysis indicated that C10orf10 was frequently decreased in human breast cancers compared to noncancerous breast tissues (81/95, P = 0.0063). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with low C10orf10 expression showed a poorer prognosis both in mRNA (n = 1115, P = 0.0013) and protein (n = 100, P = 0.003) levels. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that the C10orf10 expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival of breast cancer patients. Further analysis revealed that low expression of C10orf10 was an unfavorable factor for the prognosis of the patients who were luminal A, luminal B, Her2+ subtypes, at histological grade 2, lymph node negative and ER positive. Our data provided the first evidence that C10orf10 expression was frequently decreased in breast cancer tissues, and low expression of C10orf10 may be an important prognostic factor for poorer survival time of breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W1963867304,"An important advance in the study of visual attention has been the identification of a non-spatial component of attention that enhances the response to similar features or objects across the visual field. Here we test whether this non-spatial component can co-select individual features that are perceptually bound into a coherent object. We combined human psychophysics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to demonstrate the ability to co-select individual features from perceptually coherent objects. Our study used binocular disparity and visual motion to define disparity structure-from-motion (dSFM) stimuli. Although the spatial attention system induced strong modulations of the fMRI response in visual regions, the non-spatial system's ability to co-select features of the dSFM stimulus was less pronounced and variable across subjects. Our results demonstrate that feature and global feature attention effects are variable across participants, suggesting that the feature attention system may be limited in its ability to automatically select features within the attended object. Careful comparison of the task design suggests that even minor differences in the perceptual task may be critical in revealing the presence of global feature attention."
