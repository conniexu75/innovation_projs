https://openalex.org/W3163156375,"Psychological factors such as anxiety and confidence that students have in the patient care situation are important in that this affects the actual clinical performance. Students who are just starting clinical practice have a lack of clinical knowledge, skill proficiency, and patient communication skills, so they experience anxiety and lack of confidence in clinical setting. Practice in a safe environment, such as simulation education, can help students perform more settled and competently in patient care. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of high-fidelity simulation experience on anxiety and confidence in medical students.This study enrolled 37 5th-year students at Ajou University School of Medicine in 2020. Two simulation trainings were implemented, and a survey was conducted to measure students' level of anxiety and confidence before and after each simulation. Based on the research data, a paired t-test was conducted to compare these variables before and after the simulation, and whether this was their first or second simulation experience.Students had a significantly lower level of anxiety and a significantly higher level of confidence after the simulation than before. In addition, after one simulation experience, students had less anxiety and more confidence before the second simulation compared to those without simulation experience.We confirmed that medical students need to be repeatedly exposed to simulation education experiences in order to have a sense of psychological stability and to competently deliver medical treatment in a clinical setting. There is a practical limitation in that medical students do not have enough opportunities to meet the patients during clinical practice in hospitals. Therefore, in order to produce excellent doctors, students should have the expanded opportunities to experience simulation education so they can experience real-world medical conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3160166616,"To reduce the spread of COVID-19 transmission, government agencies in the United States (US) recommended precautionary guidelines, including wearing masks and social distancing to encourage the prevention of the disease. However, compliance with these guidelines has been inconsistent. This correlational study examined whether individual differences in risky decision-making and motivational propensities predicted compliance with COVID-19 preventative behaviors in a sample of US adults ( N = 404). Participants completed an online study from September through December 2020 that included a risky choice decision-making task, temporal discounting task, and measures of appropriate mask-wearing, social distancing, and perceived risk of engaging in public activities. Linear regression results indicated that greater temporal discounting and risky decision-making were associated with less appropriate mask-wearing behavior and social distancing. Additionally, demographic factors, including personal experience with COVID-19 and financial difficulties due to COVID-19, were also associated with differences in COVID-19 preventative behaviors. Path analysis results showed that risky decision-making behavior, temporal discounting, and risk perception collectively predicted 55% of the variance in appropriate mask-wearing behavior. Individual differences in general decision-making patterns are therefore highly predictive of who complies with COVID-19 prevention guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W3163937419,"To characterize the evolution of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation in HIV-1 infection applying a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory biomarkers to grouped subjects representing a broad spectrum of systemic HIV-1 immune suppression, CNS injury and viral control.This is a cross-sectional analysis of archived CSF and blood samples, assessing concentrations of 10 functionally diverse soluble inflammatory biomarkers by immunoassays in 143 HIV-1-infected subjects divided into 8 groups: untreated primary HIV-1 infection (PHI); four untreated groups defined by their blood CD4+ T lymphocyte counts; untreated patients presenting with subacute HIV-associated dementia (HAD); antiretroviral-treated subjects with ≥1 years of plasma viral suppression; and untreated elite controllers. Twenty HIV-1-uninfected controls were included for comparison. Background biomarkers included blood CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, CSF and blood HIV-1 RNA, CSF white blood cell (WBC) count, CSF/blood albumin ratio, CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL), and CSF t-tau.HIV-1 infection was associated with a broad compartmentalized CSF inflammatory response that developed early in its course and changed with systemic disease progression, development of neurological injury, and viral suppression. CSF inflammation in untreated individuals without overt HAD exhibited at least two overall patterns of inflammation as blood CD4+ T lymphocytes decreased: one that peaked at 200-350 blood CD4+ T cells/μL and associated with lymphocytic CSF inflammation and HIV-1 RNA concentrations; and a second that steadily increased through the full range of CD4+ T cell decline and associated with macrophage responses and increasing CNS injury. Subacute HAD was distinguished by a third inflammatory profile with increased blood-brain barrier permeability and robust combined lymphocytic and macrophage CSF inflammation. Suppression of CSF and blood HIV-1 infections by antiretroviral treatment and elite viral control were associated with reduced CSF inflammation, though not fully to levels found in HIV-1 seronegative controls."
https://openalex.org/W3160344549,"The Longshi Scale, a visual-based scale, is reliable and valid in activity assessment, but lacks cutoff definition corresponding to classical scales such as the modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationships of the Longshi Scale with the modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index and optimize cutoff scores of these scales in stroke outcomes assessment. This is a cross-sectional study. Stroke patients were measured concurrently by the Longshi scale, modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index. Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman correlation analysis were used to analyze the differences and associations among the three scales. The receiver operating characteristic curve was performed to determine the optimal cutoff scores. A total of 5475 stroke patients (67.3% ischemic) were included in this study. There are close relationships of the Longshi Scale with adjusted modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index (r = -0.861, 0.922; p<0.001, <0.001; respectively). The activity levels assessed by adjusted modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index among different Longshi scale grades were significantly different (χ2:4217.27, 4676.55; p<0.001, <0.001; respectively). The optimal cutoff scores were adjusted modified Rankin Scale 4, 3, 3, 3, 2 for Longshi scale grade 2 to 6 (sensitivity%: 96.12, 70.24, 89.10, 96.80, 86.23, specificity%: 72.72, 98.29, 93.81, 79.82, 92.89, respectively), and Barthel Index 15, 45, 60, 75, 80 for Longshi scale grade 2 to 6 (sensitivity%: 92.54, 89.28, 91.32, 90.30, 95.65, specificity%: 95.48, 89.51, 94.02, 90.41, 90.62, respectively). In conclusion, the classification of Longshi Scale is consistent with those of modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index. We recommend the Longshi Scale as an effective supplement for modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index in assessing the outcome in acute stroke patients."
https://openalex.org/W3163265830,"A maternity waiting home is a temporary residence in which pregnant women from remote areas wait for their childbirth. It is an approach targeted to advance access to emergency obstetric care services especially, in hard-to-reach areas to escalate institutional delivery to reduce complications that occur during childbirth. Apart from the availability of this service, the intention of pregnant women to utilize the existing service is very important to achieve its goals. Thus, this study aimed to assess the intention to use maternity waiting homes and associated factors among pregnant women.Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 605 pregnant women using a multistage sampling technique from March 10 to April 10, 2019, by using a structured questionnaire through a face-to-face interview. The collected data was entered into Epi-Data version 3.1 and analyzed using the SPSS version 24 statistical package. Logistic regression analysis was used to test the association. All variables at p-value < 0.25 in bivariate analysis were entered into multivariate analysis. Lastly, a significant association was declared at a P-value of < 0.05 with 95% CI.In this study, the intention to use maternity waiting homes was 295(48.8%, 95%CI: 47%-55%)). Occupation (government employee) (AOR:2.87,95%CI: 1.54-5.36), previous childbirth history (AOR:2.1,95%CI:1.22-3.57), past experience in maternity waiting home use AOR:4.35,95%CI:2.63-7.18), direct (AOR:1.57,95%CI:1.01-2.47) and indirect (AOR: 2.18, 1.38,3.44) subject norms and direct (AOR:3.00,95%CI:2.03-4.43), and indirect (AOR = 1.84,95%CI:1.25-2.71) perceived behavioral control of respondents were significantly associated variables with intention to use maternity waiting home.The magnitude of intention to use maternity waiting homes among pregnant women is low. Community disapproval, low self-efficacy, maternal employment, history of previous birth, and past experiences of MWHs utilization are predictors of intention to use MWHs, and intervention programs, such as health education, strengthening and integration of community in health system programs need to be provided."
https://openalex.org/W3163469786,"The Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) is the second largest river of Southeast Asia and one of the rivers with the highest load of suspended sediment delivered to the sea in the world. The Ayeyarwady is the lifeline of Myanmar which concentrates the majority of the population and GDP of the country. It is the main way of transport, a source of fluvial aggregates for development projects, hydropower, and the basin plays a major role in food supply and irrigation. Despite the Ayeyarwady ranking amongst the world's largest rivers and its vital importance to Myanmar, scarce research has been undertaken to understand its morphodynamics and sediment transport regime. Current load estimates still heavily rely on the only systematic study of sediment transport dating back to the 19th century. Here, we provide a novel estimate for the recent washload sediment transport based on a field calibrated remote sensing model of surface suspended sediments concentrations. We show that the Ayeyarwady has likely become the river with the second or third largest delivery of washload to the sea in the world since it has so far been much less affected by damming compared to the vast majority of other rivers."
https://openalex.org/W3163570493,"Introduction Despite the limited evidence for its effectiveness, thermal screening at points of entry has increasingly become a standard protocol in numerous parts of the globe in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to determine the effectiveness of thermal screening as a key step in diagnosing COVID-19 in a resource-limited setting. Materials and methods This was a retrospective cross-sectional study based on a review of body temperature and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 test results records for truck drivers entering Uganda through Mutukula between 15 th May and 30 th July 2020. All records missing information for body temperature, age, gender, and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 status were excluded from the data set. A data set of 7,181 entries was used to compare thermal screening and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay test results using the diagnostic statistical test in STATAv15 software. The prevalence of COVID-19 amongst the truck drivers based on Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay results was determined. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive and negative Likelihood ratios were obtained using Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay as the gold standard. Results Based on our gold standard test, the proportion of persons that tested positive for COVID-19 was 6.7% (95% CI: 6.1–7.3). Of the 7,181 persons that were thermally screened, 6,844 (95.3%) were male. The sample median age was 38 years (interquartile range, IQR: 31–45 years). The median body temperature was 36.5°C (IQR: 36.3–36.7) and only n (1.2%) had a body temperature above 37.5°C. The sensitivity and specificity of thermal screening were 9.9% (95% CI: 7.4–13.0) and 99.5% (95% CI: 99.3–99.6) respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 57.8 (95% CI: 46.5–68.6) and 93.9 (95% CI: 93.3–94.4) respectively. The positive and negative Likelihood Ratios (LRs) were 19 (95% CI: 12.4–29.1) and 0.9 (95% CI: 0.88–0.93) respectively. Conclusion In this study population, the use of Thermal screening alone is ineffective in the detection of potential COVID-19 cases at point of entry. We recommend a combination of screening tests or additional testing using highly sensitive molecular diagnostics such as Polymerase Chain Reaction."
https://openalex.org/W3160528545,"Background HIV management remains concerning and even more challenging in the frame of comorbidities like malnutrition that favors disease progression and mortality in resource-limited settings (RLS). Objective To describe the nutritional parameters of antiretroviral therapy (ART) recipients (without nutritional support) with respect to CD4 count and virological failure. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from October to December 2018 among 146 consenting participants enrolled in two health facilities of the East-Region of Cameroon. Socio-demographic data, basic clinical information and treatment history were collected; blood samples were collected by venipuncture for laboratory analysis (HIV-1 viral load, CD4 Tcells measurement and biochemical analysis) performed at the “Chantal Biya” International Reference Center”, Yaounde, Cameroon. The nutritional profile was assessed by using anthropometric and biochemical parameters. Data were analyzed using Excel 2016, Graph pad prism version 6; Spearman correlation and Kruskal-Wallis test were used; with p&lt;0.05 considered statistically significant. Results Median [IQR] age was 42 [33–51] years, 76.0% (111/146) were female and median [IQR] duration on ART was 54 [28–86] months. Of these participants, 11.6% (17/146) were underweight based on the body mass index and 4.7% (7/146) were at the stage of advanced weight loss. According to immunovirological responses, 44.5% (65/146) were immunocompromised (CD4&lt;500 cell/μl) and 75.3% (110/146) had an undetectable viremia (&lt;40 copies/mL). CD4 count inversely correlated with total protein concentration (r = -0.18, p = 0.005**). Viremia was inversely correlated with albumin (r = -0.21; p = 0.047*), nutritional risk index (r = -0.28; p = 0.013*), total cholesterol (r = -0.27; p = 0.007**), and positively correlated with total protein (r = 0.27; p&lt;0.001**) concentrations. Conclusion In this RLS, with patients having about five years of ART-experience, malnutrition appears to be driven mainly by a poor BMI, indicating that about one of ten patients falls within this severe condition. However, the largely normal nutritional profiles should be interpreted with caution, considering local realities and food support programs in place. The present outcomes highlight the need for monitoring nutritional status of people receiving ART in RLS, toward the design of optimal food interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3163844002,"Marine fungi and, particularly, endophytic species have been recognised as one of the most prolific sources of structurally new and diverse bioactive secondary metabolites with multiple biotechnological applications. Despite the increasing number of bioprospecting studies, very few have already evaluated the cosmeceutical potential of marine fungal compounds. Thus, this study focused on a frequent seaweed in the Portuguese coast, Halopteris scoparia, to identify the endophytic marine fungi associated with this host, and assess their ability to biosynthesise secondary metabolites with antioxidative, enzymatic inhibitory (hyaluronidase, collagenase, elastase and tyrosinase), anti-inflammatory, photoprotective, and antimicrobial (Cutibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Malassezia furfur) activities. The results revealed eight fungal taxa included in the Ascomycota, and in the most representative taxonomic classes in marine ecosystems (Eurotiomycetes, Sordariomycetes and Dothideomycetes). These fungi were reported for the first time in Portugal and in association with H. scoparia, as far as it is known. The screening analyses showed that most of these endophytic fungi were producers of compounds with relevant biological activities, though those biosynthesised by Penicillium sect. Exilicaulis and Aspergillus chevalieri proved to be the most promising ones for being further exploited by dermocosmetic industry. The chemical analysis of the crude extract from an isolate of A. chevalieri revealed the presence of two bioactive compounds, echinulin and neoechinulin A, which might explain the high antioxidant and UV photoprotective capacities exhibited by the extract. These noteworthy results emphasised the importance of screening the secondary metabolites produced by these marine endophytic fungal strains for other potential bioactivities, and the relevance of investing more efforts in understanding the ecology of halo/osmotolerant fungi."
https://openalex.org/W3161120471,"Closely connected to human carbon emissions, global climate change is affecting regional economic and social development, natural ecological environment, food security, water supply, and many other social aspects. In a word, climate change has become a vital issue of general concern in the current society. In this study, the carbon emission data of Chinese provinces in 1999–2019 are collected and analyzed, so as to identify the carbon emission of direct consumption per 10,000 residents in each province (including each municipal city and autonomous region) and the entire nation based on population data. The Arc Geographic Information Science Engine (ArcGIS Engine) and C#.NET platform are employed to call the MATLAB neural network toolbox. A model is selected and embedded in the prediction system to develop the entire system. This study demonstrates that the carbon emissions per resident in Northern China are significantly higher than those in Southern China, with the rate of carbon emissions continuing to increase over time. Compared with other models, the Elman neural network has a higher carbon emission prediction accuracy, but with more minor errors. For instance, its accuracy and prediction performance are improved by 55.93% and 19.48%, respectively, compared with the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN). The prediction results show that China is expected to reach its peak carbon emission in around 2025–2030. The above results are acquired based on the concept of carbon emissions and neural network model theories, supported by GIS component technology and intelligent methods. The feasibility of BPNN, Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Elman neural network models for predicting residential carbon emissions is analyzed. This study also designs a comprehensive, integrated and extensible visual intelligent platform, which is easy to implement and stable in operation. The trend and characteristics of carbon emission changes from 2027 to 2032 are explored and predicted based on the data about direct carbon emissions of Chinese provincial residents from 1999 to 2019, purposed to provide a scientific basis for the control and planning of carbon emissions."
https://openalex.org/W3161550095,"Self-compatibility has become the primary objective of most prune ( Prunus domestica ) breeding programs in order to avoid the problems related to the gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) system present in this crop. GSI is typically under the control of a specific locus., known as the S -locus., which contains at least two genes. The first gene encodes glycoproteins with RNase activity in the pistils., and the second is an SFB gene expressed in the pollen. There is limited information on genetics of SI/SC in prune and in comparison., with other Prunus species, cloning., sequencing and discovery of different S -alleles is very scarce. Clear information about S -alleles can be used for molecular identification and characterization of the S -haplotypes. We determined the S -alleles of 36 cultivars and selections using primers that revealed 17 new alleles. In addition, our study describes for the first time the association and design of a molecular marker for self-compatibility in P . domestica . Our phylogenetic tree showed that the S -alleles are spread across the phylogeny, suggesting that like previous alleles detected in the Rosaceae., they were of trans-specific origin. We provide for the first time 3D models for the P . domestica SI RNase alleles as well as in other Prunus species, including P . salicina (Japanese plum), P . avium (cherry), P . armeniaca (apricot), P . cerasifera and P . spinosa ."
https://openalex.org/W3163195502,"Proteins and lipids of milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) and probiotics are immunomodulatory. We hypothesized that Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei strain F19 (F19) would augment vaccine antibody and T helper 1 type immune responses whereas MFGM would produce an immune response closer to that of breastfed (BF) infants.To compare the effects of supplementing formula with F19 or bovine MFGM on serum cytokine and vaccine responses of formula-fed (FF) and BF infants.FF infants were randomized to formula with F19 (n = 195) or MFGM (n = 192), or standard formula (SF) (n = 194) from age 21±7 days until 4 months. A BF group served as reference (n = 208). We analyzed seven cytokines (n = 398) in serum at age 4 months using magnetic bead-based multiplex technology. Using ELISA, we analyzed anti-diphtheria IgG (n = 258) and anti-poliovirus IgG (n = 309) concentrations in serum before and after the second and third immunization, respectively.Compared with SF, the F19 group had greater IL-2 and lower IFN-γ concentrations (p<0.05, average effect size 0.14 and 0.39). Compared with BF, the F19 group had greater IL-2, IL-4 and IL-17A concentrations (p<0.05, average effect size 0.42, 0.34 and 0.26, respectively). The MFGM group had lower IL-2 and IL-17A concentrations compared with SF (p<0.05, average effect size 0.34 and 0.31). Cytokine concentrations were comparable among the MFGM and BF groups. Vaccine responses were comparable among the formula groups.Contrary to previous studies F19 increased IL-2 and lowered IFN-γ production, suggesting that the response to probiotics differs across populations. The cytokine profile of the MFGM group approached that of BF infants, and may be associated with the previous finding that infectious outcomes for the MFGM group in this cohort were closer to those of BF infants, as opposed to the SF group. These immunomodulatory effects support future clinical evaluation of infant formula with F19 or MFGM."
https://openalex.org/W3163832930,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an urgent public health problem and disproportionately affects Mexican Americans. The gut microbiome contributes to the pathophysiology of diabetes; however, no studies have examined this association in Mexican-Americans. The objective of this study was to compare gut microbiome composition between Mexican-Americans with and without T2DM.This was a cross-sectional study of volunteers from San Antonio, TX. Subjects were 18 years or older and self-identified as Mexican American. Subjects were grouped by prior T2DM diagnosis. Eligible subjects attended a clinic visit to provide demographic and medical information. Thereafter, subjects recorded their dietary intake for three days and collected a stool sample on the fourth day. Stool 16s rRNA sequences were classified into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) via the mothur bayesian classifier and referenced to the Greengenes database. Shannon diversity and bacterial taxa relative abundance were compared between groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Beta diversity was estimated using Bray-Curtis indices and compared between groups using PERMANOVA.Thirty-seven subjects were included, 14 (38%) with diabetes and 23 (62%) without diabetes. Groups were well-matched by body mass index and comorbid conditions. Shannon diversity was not significantly different between those with and without T2DM (3.26 vs. 3.31; p = 0.341). Beta diversity was not significantly associated with T2DM diagnosis (p = 0.201). The relative abundance of the most common bacterial phyla and families did not significantly differ between groups; however, 16 OTUs were significantly different between groups.Although alpha diversity was not significantly different between diabetic and non-diabetic Mexican Americans, the abundance of certain bacterial taxa were significantly different between groups."
https://openalex.org/W3160186763,"Ostracoda (bivalved Crustacea) comprise a significant part of the benthic meiofauna in the Pacific-Arctic region, including more than 50 species, many with identifiable ecological tolerances. These species hold potential as useful indicators of past and future ecosystem changes. In this study, we examined benthic ostracodes from nearly 300 surface sediment samples, >34,000 specimens, from three regions-the northern Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort Seas-to establish species' ecology and distribution. Samples were collected during various sampling programs from 1970 through 2018 on the continental shelves at 20 to ~100m water depth. Ordination analyses using species' relative frequencies identified six species, Normanicythere leioderma, Sarsicytheridea bradii, Paracyprideis pseudopunctillata, Semicytherura complanata, Schizocythere ikeyai, and Munseyella mananensis, as having diagnostic habitat ranges in bottom water temperatures, salinities, sediment substrates and/or food sources. Species relative abundances and distributions can be used to infer past bottom environmental conditions in sediment archives for paleo-reconstructions and to characterize potential changes in Pacific-Arctic ecosystems in future sampling studies. Statistical analyses further showed ostracode assemblages grouped by the summer water masses influencing the area. Offshore-to-nearshore transects of samples across different water masses showed that complex water mass characteristics, such as bottom temperature, productivity, as well as sediment texture, influenced the relative frequencies of ostracode species over small spatial scales. On the larger biogeographic scale, synoptic ordination analyses showed dominant species-N. leioderma (Bering Sea), P. pseudopunctillata (offshore Chukchi and Beaufort Seas), and S. bradii (all regions)-remained fairly constant over recent decades. However, during 2013-2018, northern Pacific species M. mananensis and S. ikeyai increased in abundance by small but significant proportions in the Chukchi Sea region compared to earlier years. It is yet unclear if these assemblage changes signify a meiofaunal response to changing water mass properties and if this trend will continue in the future. Our new ecological data on ostracode species and biogeography suggest these hypotheses can be tested with future benthic monitoring efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3160488185,"To evaluate the efficacy of the quadruple test for potential use as a Thai national policy for Down syndrome (DS) screening and establish an accurate equation for risk estimation of Down syndrome based on gestational age, weight and the ethnic-specific reference range of our population.A prospective study was conducted on singleton pregnancies at 14 to 21 weeks of gestation to evaluate the efficacy of quadruple DS screening using the automatically calculated Western European descent factor (WF) in our population and the impact of screening using a specific Thai ethnic factor as well as to establish an equation for the risk estimation of DS based on gestational age, weight and a local Thai ethnic factor to correct for the impact of ethnic factor on the screening efficacy.Of a total of 5,515 women, 12 cases of DS and 8 cases of other aneuploidies were found. The detection rate, false positive rate and specificity were 75.0%, 9.1% and 90.9%, respectively, by automatic calculation with the widely used WF; the screening efficacy was lower when used in Asian populations than in other studies. The best-fitted regression equation of serum quadruple screening of AFP, free β-hCG, uE3 and inhibin A was established by adjustment for gestational age (GA) in days, maternal weight and our Thai-specific ethnic reference range which was created for this study. Calculations with our Thai-specific ethnic model gave a better detection rate of 83.3%, a false positive rate of 9.6% and specificity of 90.4%.The serum quadruple test had a lower detection rate than expected when the risk estimation was based on the WF reference range. The serum quadruple test using WF had significantly different levels when corrected with our ethnic-specific factor. Using our local ethnic specific model could increase the detection rate of DS screening in Thailand with a minimal increase in false positive rates. Our findings indicate that DS screening should be adjusted with an appropriate individual ethnic factor when used for national screening."
https://openalex.org/W3161510360,"Objective To examine the relationship between current cigarette smoking patterns and three established risk factors for suicide using nationally representative data of high school students in the United States. Methods We analyzed cross-sectional data from the national Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (YRBSS)–United States, 2017. Multivariable, logistic regressions examined the association between 3 cigarette smoking behaviors [i.e., past 30-day cigarette (n = 13,731), frequent (n = 1,093) and heavy (n = 880) smoking] and 3 risk factors for suicidal outcomes [feeling sad or hopeless, suicidal ideation, suicide plan] assessed over the previous year. Results Among high school cigarette smokers, smoking 11 or more cigarettes per day (i.e., heavy smoking) was associated with 3.43 (95% CI: 1.69, 6.94) greater odds of reporting feeling sad or hopeless, 2.97 (95% CI: 1.60, 5.51) greater odds of reporting suicidal ideations, and 2.11 (95% CI: 1.34, 3.32) greater odds of reporting having ever planned a suicide attempt, controlling for covariates. Conclusions Our study shows that it is not simply cigarette smoking, but heavy cigarette smoking that is a risk factor for suicidal outcomes among adolescents. Public health implications A comprehensive plan is needed to accommodate heavy adolescent smokers who are at increased suicidal risk."
https://openalex.org/W3162697966,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising candidates in biomarker discovery and diagnostics. Protected by the lipid bilayer, the molecular content of EVs in diverse biofluids are protected from RNases and proteases in the surrounding environment that may rapidly degrade targets of interests. Nonetheless, cryopreservation of EV-containing samples to -80°C may expose the lipid bilayer to physical and biological stressors which may result in cryoinjury and contribute to changes in EV yield, function, or molecular cargo. In the present work, we systematically evaluate the effect of cryopreservation at -80°C for a relatively short duration of storage (up to 12 days) on plasma- and media-derived EV particle count and/or RNA yield/quality, as compared to paired fresh controls. On average, we found that the plasma-derived EV concentration of stored samples decreased to 23% of fresh samples. Further, this significant decrease in EV particle count was matched with a corresponding significant decrease in RNA yield whereby plasma-derived stored samples contained only 47-52% of the total RNA from fresh samples, depending on the extraction method used. Similarly, media-derived EVs showed a statistically significant decrease in RNA yield whereby stored samples were 58% of the total RNA from fresh samples. In contrast, we did not obtain clear evidence of decreased RNA quality through analysis of RNA traces. These results suggest that samples stored for up to 12 days can indeed produce high-quality RNA; however, we note that when directly comparing fresh versus cryopreserved samples without cryoprotective agents there are significant losses in total RNA. Finally, we demonstrate that the addition of the commonly used cryoprotectant agent, DMSO, alongside greater control of the rate of cooling/warming, can rescue EVs from damaging ice formation and improve RNA yield."
https://openalex.org/W3163261324,"A diverse range of threats have been associated with managed-bee declines globally. Recent increases of two known threats, land-use change and pesticide use, have resulted from agricultural expansion and intensification notably in the top honey-producing state in the United States: North Dakota. This study investigated the dual threat from land conversion and pesticide use surrounding ~14,000 registered apiaries in North Dakota from 2001 to 2014. We estimated the annual total insecticide use (kg) on major crops within 1.6 km of apiary sites. Of the eight insecticides quantified, six showed significant increasing trends over the time period. Specifically, applications of the newly established neonicotinoids Chlothianidin, Imidacloprid and Thiamethoxam, increased annually by 1329 kg, 686 kg, 795 kg, respectively. Also, the use of Chlorpyrifos, which was well-established in the state by 2001 and is highly toxic to honey bees, increased by ~8,800 kg annually from 6,500 kg in 2001 to 115,000 kg in 2014 on corn, soybeans and wheat. We further evaluated the relative quality changes of natural/semi-natural land covers surrounding apiaries in 2006, 2010 and 2014, a period of significant increases in cropland area. In areas surrounding apiaries, we observed changes in multiple indices of forage quality that reflect the deteriorating landscape surrounding registered apiary sites due to land-use change and pesticide-use increases. Overall, our results suggest that the application of foliar-applied insecticides, including pyrethroids and one organophosphate, increased surrounding apiaries when the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments surged and the area for producing corn and soybeans expanded. Spatially, these threats were most pronounced in southeastern North Dakota, a region hosting a high density of apiary sites that has recently experienced corn and soybean expansion. Our results highlight the value of natural and semi-natural land covers as sources of pollinator forage and refugia for bees against pesticide exposure. Our study provides insights for targeting conservation efforts to improve forage quality benefiting managed pollinators."
https://openalex.org/W3161861798,"To understand driving biological factors for complex diseases like cancer, regulatory circuity of genes needs to be discovered. Recently, a new gene regulation mechanism called competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interactions has been discovered. Certain genes targeted by common microRNAs (miRNAs) ""compete"" for these miRNAs, thereby regulate each other by making others free from miRNA regulation. Several computational tools have been published to infer ceRNA networks. In most existing tools, however, expression abundance sufficiency, collective regulation, and groupwise effect of ceRNAs are not considered. In this study, we developed a computational tool named Crinet to infer genome-wide ceRNA networks addressing critical drawbacks. Crinet considers all mRNAs, lncRNAs, and pseudogenes as potential ceRNAs and incorporates a network deconvolution method to exclude the spurious ceRNA pairs. We tested Crinet on breast cancer data in TCGA. Crinet inferred reproducible ceRNA interactions and groups, which were significantly enriched in the cancer-related genes and processes. We validated the selected miRNA-target interactions with the protein expression-based benchmarks and also evaluated the inferred ceRNA interactions predicting gene expression change in knockdown assays. The hub genes in the inferred ceRNA network included known suppressor/oncogene lncRNAs in breast cancer showing the importance of non-coding RNA's inclusion for ceRNA inference. Crinet-inferred ceRNA groups that were consistently involved in the immune system related processes could be important assets in the light of the studies confirming the relation between immunotherapy and cancer. The source code of Crinet is in R and available at https://github.com/bozdaglab/crinet."
https://openalex.org/W3161891616,"In the context of an ongoing debate on the potential risks of hypoxemia and hyperoxemia, it seems prudent to maintain the partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) in a physiological range during administration of supplemental oxygen. The PaO2 and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) are closely related and both are used to monitor oxygenation status. However, SpO2 values cannot be used as an exact substitute for PaO2. The aim of this study in acutely ill and stable patients was to determine at which SpO2 level PaO2 is more or less certain to be in the physiological range.This is an observational study prospectively collecting data pairs of PaO2 and SpO2 values in patients admitted to the emergency room or intensive care unit (Prospective Inpatient Acutely ill cohort; PIA cohort). A second cohort of retrospective data of patients who underwent pulmonary function testing was also included (Retrospective Outpatient Pulmonary cohort; ROP cohort). Arterial hypoxemia was defined as PaO2 < 60 mmHg and hyperoxemia as PaO2 > 125 mmHg. The SpO2 cut-off values with the lowest risk of hypoxemia and hyperoxemia were determined as the 95th percentile of the observed SpO2 values corresponding with the observed hypoxemic and hyperoxemic PaO2 values.220 data pairs were collected in the PIA cohort. 95% of hypoxemic PaO2 measurements occurred in patients with an SpO2 below 94%, and 95% of hyperoxemic PaO2 measurements occurred in patients with an SpO2 above 96%. Additionally in the 1379 data pairs of the ROP cohort, 95% of hypoxemic PaO2 measurements occurred in patients with an SpO2 below 93%.The SpO2 level marking an increased risk of arterial hypoxemia is not substantially different in acutely ill versus stable patients. In acutely ill patients receiving supplemental oxygen an SpO2 target of 95% maximizes the likelihood of maintaining PaO2 in the physiological range."
https://openalex.org/W3162699059,"The transition into the clinical environment is challenging and associated with significant stress and anxiety. This study aimed to examine the perspectives of students on the characteristics important for preparedness for clinical learning and the influence of gender, age, and graduate status on those perspectives. This descriptive, questionnaire-based study of 62 characteristics categorised into six themes was conducted within the Surrey School of Veterinary Medicine completed by 139 students commencing their final clinical year. The Friedman test and post-hoc Wilcoxon signed rank sum test explored for differences in ranking across the themes. Ordinal logistic regression and Mann-Whitney U pairwise comparisons were utilised to investigate for effects of gender, age, and graduate status on theme ranking. There was a significant difference (P &lt;0.05) between medians for themes of preparedness characteristics with comparisons revealing willingness and communication and interaction as the most highly rated characteristics. Knowledge and understanding were viewed as the least important characteristic. Regression and pairwise Mann-Whitney U comparisons confirmed no significant effects (P &gt;0.05) of gender, age or graduate status on student rating of preparedness characteristics. Integrating learning opportunities of those preparedness characteristics in the pre-clinical curriculum may improve students’ preparedness for the clinical environment."
https://openalex.org/W3111946531,"The dynamical behavior of social systems can be described by agent-based models. Although single agents follow easily explainable rules, complex time-evolving patterns emerge due to their interaction. The simulation and analysis of such agent-based models, however, is often prohibitively time-consuming if the number of agents is large. In this paper, we show how Koopman operator theory can be used to derive reduced models of agent-based systems using only simulation data. Our goal is to learn coarse-grained models and to represent the reduced dynamics by ordinary or stochastic differential equations. The new variables are, for instance, aggregated state variables of the agent-based model, modeling the collective behavior of larger groups or the entire population. Using benchmark problems with known coarse-grained models, we demonstrate that the obtained reduced systems are in good agreement with the analytical results, provided that the numbers of agents is sufficiently large."
https://openalex.org/W3160108810,"Several angiogenesis-dependent diseases, including age-related macular degeneration and infantile hemangioma, display differential prevalence among Black, as compared to White individuals. Although socioeconomic status and genetic architecture have been suggested as explaining these differences, we have recently shown that pigment production per se might be involved. For example, we have shown that the extracellular protein fibromodulin is a pro-angiogenic factor highly secreted by melanocytes in White but not Black individuals. Still, additional pigment-dependent angiogenic factors and their molecular mechanisms remain to be identified. Understanding the contribution of pigmentation to angiogenesis in health and disease is essential for precision medicine of angiogenesis-dependent diseases with racial disparity. Toward that goal, we compared the transcriptomes of Black and White individuals in three tissues with angiogenic activity, namely artery, whole blood, and skin. We identified several differentially expressed angiogenesis pathways, including artery morphogenesis, regulation of endothelial cell chemotaxis, and cellular response to vascular endothelial growth factor stimulus. We then demonstrated that the expression of key genes in these pathways is directly modulated by the degree of pigmentation. We further identified the precise pigment production pathway controlling the expression of these genes, namely melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) signaling. These results demonstrate pigment-mediated regulation of angiogenesis-related pathways and their driver genes across human tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3160955487,"Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), one of the most commonly reported spinal disorders, can cause loss of sensation and dyskinesia. In currently used animal models of LSS, the spinal cord is covered entirely with a silicone sheet, or block-shaped silicone is inserted directly into the spinal canal after laminectomy. However, the effects of differences between these implant materials have not been studied. We assessed the degree of damage and locomotor function of an LSS model in Sprague-Dawley rats using silicone blocks of varying hardness (70, 80, and 90 kPa) implanted at the L4 level. In sham rats, the spinal cord remained intact; in LSS rats, the spinal cord was increasingly compressed by the mechanical pressure of the silicone blocks as hardness increased. Inflammatory cells were not evident in sham rats, but numerous inflammatory cells were observed around the implanted silicone block in LSS rats. CD68+ cell quantification revealed increases in the inflammatory response in a hardness-dependent manner in LSS rats. Compared with those in sham rats, proinflammatory cytokine levels were significantly elevated in a hardness-dependent manner, and locomotor function was significantly decreased, in LSS rats. Overall, this study showed that hardness could be used as an index to control the severity of nerve injury induced by silicone implants."
https://openalex.org/W3161018886,"Background Mouth-nose masks have been requested to prevent the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The aim of the present study was to investigate, if wearing a mouth-nose mask impairs the visual field function in normals. Methods Thirty eyes of 30 subjects were recruited for the present study. White-on-white perimetry (OCTOPUS 900; 90°) was done and sensitivity was analysed in 14 defined test points (P1-P14, inferior visual field) under 3 different test conditions while the subjects were wearing a mouth-nose mask: (I) 1.5 cm under the lower eyelid, nose clip not used (position 1.5cm_no_clip ); (II) 1.5 cm under the lower eyelid, nose clip correctly positioned (position 1.5cm_with_clip ); (III) 0.5 cm under the lower eyelid, nose clip correctly positioned (position 0.5cm_with_clip ). All data were compared to sensitivity without wearing a mouth-nose mask (reference). Mean Δ was calculated, being the difference between the results of each test condition and reference, respectively. Results Sensitivity was significantly different between position 1.5cm_no_clip and reference at 10 test points (p&lt;0.05). Sensitivity at test point P7 was significantly different between position 1.5cm_with_clip and position 0.5cm_with_clip compared to reference (p&lt;0.001), respectively. Mean Δ increased while wearing a mask at P7: position 1.5cm_with_clip (-8.3 dB ± 7.3 dB) &lt; position 0.5cm_with_clip (-11.3 dB ± 9.5 dB) &lt; position 1.5cm_no_clip (-20.1 dB ± 7.6 dB). Conclusion Visual field function was observed to be significantly impaired in the inferior-nasal sector while persons were wearing a mouth-nose mask, especially when the nose clip was not correctly used."
https://openalex.org/W3161304663,"Oral therapeutics used to treat type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease often fail to prevent the progression of disease and their comorbidities. Rooibos ( Aspalathus linearis ), an endemic South African plant used as an herbal tea, has demonstrated positive effects on glycemia and hypercholesterolemia. However, the treatment efficacy of rooibos extract in combination with conventional hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic medications on blood glucose and lipid profiles has not been established. This study aimed to investigate the effects of combining an aspalathin-rich green rooibos extract (Afriplex GRT ™ ) with pioglitazone and atorvastatin, on blood glucose and lipid levels in obese diabetic ( db/db ) mice. Six-week-old male db/db mice and their nondiabetic lean littermate controls ( db+ ) were divided into 8 experimental groups (n = 6/group). Db/db mice were treated daily either with pioglitazone (25 mg/kg), atorvastatin (80 mg/kg) and GRT (100 mg/kg), a combination of either drug with GRT or a combination of GRT-pioglitazone and atorvastatin for 5 weeks. Untreated vehicle controls were given dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1%) and phosphate buffered saline solution. At termination, serum and liver tissue were collected for lipid and gene expression analysis. Treatment with GRT, pioglitazone and atorvastatin combination effectively lowered fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels in db/db mice (p = 0.02), whilst increasing body weight, liver weight, and reducing retroperitoneal fat weight. Atorvastatin monotherapy was effective at reducing cholesterol (from 4.00 ± 0.12 to 2.93 ± 0.13, p = 0.0003), LDL-C (from 0.58 ± 0.04 to 0.50 ± 0.00, p = 0.04), HDL-C (from 2.86 ± 0.05 to 2.50 ± 0.04, p = 0.0003) and TG (from 2.77 ± 0.50 to 1.48 ± 0.23, p = 0.04), compared to the untreated diabetic control. The hypotriglyceridemic effect of atorvastatin was enhanced when used in combination with both GRT and pioglitazone. The addition of pioglitazone to GRT significantly lowered FPG and TG. In db/db mice, Apoa1 was significantly downregulated in the liver, whilst Pparγ was significantly upregulated compared to their db+ counterparts. GRT monotherapy downregulated Apoa1 expression (p = 0.02). Atorvastatin combined with GRT significantly downregulated mRNA expression of Apoa1 (p = 0.03), whilst upregulating the expression of Pparγ (p = 0.03), Pparα (p = 0.002), Srebp1 (p = 0.002), and Fasn (p = 0.04). The GRT-pioglitazone-atorvastatin combination therapy downregulated Apoa1 (p = 0.006), whilst upregulating Fasn (p = 0.005), Pparα (p = 0.041), and Srebp1 (p = 0.03). Natural products can improve the efficacy of current drugs to prevent diabetes-associated complications. GRT in combination with pioglitazone enhanced the reduction of FPG, whilst the addition of atorvastatin to the combination, significantly lowered triglyceride levels. However, when GRT was used in combination with atorvastatin only cholesterol levels were affected. Although these results confirm both glucose- and lipoprotein-lowering biological effects of GRT in combination with pioglitazone and atorvastatin, increased expression of genes involved in lipogenesis, cholesterol, and fatty acid transport, β-oxidation, and synthesis and storage of fatty acids, may exacerbate the hepatotoxic effects of atorvastatin."

This study aims to evaluate the measurement of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) as a diagnostic tool of HS in living liver donors.Candidates recruited to this study, conducted from April 2016 to February 2020, were potential donors who had undergone transient elastography using Fibroscan® and CAP measurements at liver segments VI and VII, followed by liver biopsy. The HS grades from liver biopsy were classified as S0 (<5%), S1 (5-33%), S2 (33-66%), and S3 (>66%). For CAP, they were S0 (≤218dB/m), S1 (218-249dB/m)), S2 (250-305dB/m)), and S3 (>305dB/m)). The CAP measurements were compared with the liver biopsy results.Of the 150 potential donors [male, 73.3%; mean age, 30.0±7.0 years; body mass index (BMI), 24.7±3.5kg/m2], 92 (61.3%) had no or mild HS, while 58 (38.7%) and 10% had moderate to severe HS based on CAP and liver biopsy, respectively. Subjects with moderate to severe HS per CAP were mostly males (0.014), and had higher BMI (p = .006), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (.001), gamma-glutamyl transferase (.026), and high-density lipoprotein (.008). On multivariate analysis, high ALT (OR, 1.051; 95% CI, 1.016-1.087; p = .004) was a predictor of significant HS. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of CAP to detect significant HS were 93.3%, 67.4, 24.1%, and 98.9%, respectively.The high sensitivity and negative predictive values of CAP make it a good screening test to exclude significant HS in potential living liver donors which, in turn, can help avoid unnecessary liver biopsies."
https://openalex.org/W3161944477,"The aim of the present study was to classify the latent body fat trajectories of Chinese adults and their relationships with cardiometabolic risk factors. Data were obtained from the China Health Nutrition Survey for 3,013 participants, who underwent six follow-up visits between 1993 and 2009. Skinfold thickness and other anthropometric indicators were used to estimate body composition. The latent growth model was used to create fat mass to fat-free mass ratio (F2FFMR) trajectory groups. Blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high- and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were measured in venous blood after an overnight fast. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationships of F2FFMR trajectory with cardiometabolic risk factors. In men, four types of F2FFMR trajectory were identified. After adjustment for behavioral and lifestyle factors, age, and weight status, and compared with the Low stability group, the High stability group showed a significant association with diabetes. In women, three types of F2FFMR trajectory were identified. Compared to the Low stability group, the High stability group showed significant associations with diabetes and hypertension after adjustment for the same covariates as in men. Thus, in this long-term study we have identified three F2FFMR trajectory groups in women and four in men. In both sexes, the highly stable F2FFMR is associated with the highest risk of developing diabetes, independent of age and body mass. In addition, in women, it is associated with the highest risk of hypertension, independent of age and body mass."
https://openalex.org/W3163001347,"The yellowtail rockfish, Sebastes flavidus , is a widespread and abundant mesopredator in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. We utilized stomach content and stable isotope analyses to investigate the trophic ecology of this species at three sites off central California just before (August–October 2013) and during (August and October 2014) a marine heat wave. Sebastes flavidus largely consumed pelagic prey (zooplankton and micronekton). Diets were dominated by tunicates (salps and pyrosomes), pelagic crustaceans (euphausiids, hyperid amphipods, larval decapods), and fishes, with the relative contribution of these prey taxa varying spatially (sample location, longitude, depth) and temporally (year, month), based on complementary multivariate analyses. Prey-specific indices demonstrated that individual S . flavidus diet composition typically was dominated by one of these prey groups, and that prey switching occurred based on the relative availability of prey and their energetic importance. Stable isotope analysis of δ 15 N indicated that the S . flavidus populations sampled in 2014 had been feeding at an elevated trophic position and more variable prey spectrum relative to 2013, probably as a consequence of greater piscivory and the incorporation of temporal changes in diet composition. Because its opportunistic feeding behavior reflects the dynamism and heterogeneity of the pelagic forage preyscape, S . flavidus may be an important ecosystem indicator species. For example, the novel incorporation of pyrosomes as a large portion of the diet of S . flavidus during 2013–2014 directly related to the massive increase in pyrosome abundance in the California Current during the 2014 marine heat wave."
https://openalex.org/W3160041745,"Background Chronic kidney disease is commonly found in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and has marked impact in their prognosis. It has been shown however that TAVR may improve renal function by alleviating the hemodynamic barrier imposed by AS. Nevertheless, the predictors of and clinical consequences of renal function improvement are not well established. Our aim was to assess the predictors of improvement of renal function after TAVR. Methods The present work is an analysis of the Brazilian Registry of TAVR, a national non-randomized prospective study with 22 Brazilian centers. Patients with baseline renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt; 60mL/min/1.73m 2 ) were stratified according to renal function after TAVR: increase &gt;10% in eGFR were classified as TAVR induced renal function improvement (TIRFI); decrease &gt; 10% in eGFR were classified as acute kidney injury (AKI) and stable renal function (neither criteria). Results A total of 819 consecutive patients with symptomatic severe AS were included. Of these, baseline renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt; 60mL/min/1.73m 2 ) was present in 577 (70%) patients. Considering variance in renal function between baseline and at discharge after TAVR procedure, TIRFI was seen in 197 (34.1%) patients, AKI in 203 (35.2%), and stable renal function in 177 (30.7%). The independent predictors of TIRFI were: absence of coronary artery disease (OR: 0.69; 95% CI 0.48–0.98; P = 0.039) and lower baseline eGFR (OR: 0.98; 95% CI 0.97–1.00; P = 0.039). There was no significant difference in 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality between patients with stable renal function or TIRFI. Nonetheless, individuals that had AKI after TAVR presented higher mortality compared with TIRFI and stable renal function groups (29.3% vs. 15.4% vs. 9.5%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions TIRFI was frequently found among baseline impaired renal function individuals but was not associated with improved 1-year outcomes."

This study explored experiences of healthcare providers (HCP) and primary care patients (PCP) with mental-physical MM treatment adherence. Adults PCP with mental-physical MM and their primary care and community mental health care providers were recruited through maximum variation sampling from nine cities in São Paulo State, Southeast of Brazil. Experiences across quality domains of the Primary Care Assessment Tool-Brazil were explored through semi-structured in-depth interviews with 19 PCP and 62 HCP, conducted between April 2016 and April 2017. Through thematic conent analysis ten meta-themes concerning treatment adherence were developed: 1) variability and accessibility of treatment options available through PHC; 2) importance of coming to terms with a disease for treatment initation; 3) importance of person-centred communication for treatment initiation and maintenance; 4) information sources about received medication; 5) monitoring medication adherence; 6) taking medication unsafely; 7) perceived reasons for medication non-adherence; 8) most challenging health behavior change goals; 9) main motives for initiation or maintenance of treatment; 10) methods deployed to improve treatment adherence. Our analysis has advanced the understanding of complexity inherent to treatment adherence in mental-physical MM and revealed opportunities for improvement and specific solutions to effect adherence in Brazil.

Although the rate of under-nutrition in Ethiopia has declined in the last decade, but it still remains being the major causes of morbidity and mortality of children under-five years. The problem is even worse in rural areas. The prevalence of underweight among rural children was 25% compared with 13% among urban children. To alleviate this problem, it is necessary to determine the magnitude and determinants of underweight. The study models non-Gaussian data analysis to identify risk factors associated with underweight among under-five children in rural Ethiopia.The data source for this study was secondary data, which was retrieved from EDHS 2016 database. It was analyzed using two model families; one with marginal models (GEE and ALR) in which responses are modeled and marginalized overall other responses, and the other is random effects model (GLMM) which is useful when the interest of the analyst lies in the individual's response profiles as well as to evaluate within and between regional variations of underweight.From fitting non-Gaussian data analysis to identify risk factors associated with underweight among under five children in rural Ethiopia, the independent variable which have significant effect on underweight were:-Age of child, birth interval, mothers education, fathers education, wealth index, diarrhea in last two weeks, fever in last two weeks are significant and also father's work status shows that difference in significance among the category.Child age, preceding birth interval, mother's education, household's wealth index, fever, diarrhea, father's education and father's work status were associated with child underweight. Furthermore, there is both within and between regional heterogeneity of underweight among children in rural Ethiopia. Therefore, rigorous community-based interventions (such as uplifting mother's education by providing formal education and preventing infectious diseases that cause diarrhea and fever) should be developed and executed throughout the country to improve this grave situation of underweight prevalence in rural areas of Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W3161788134,"People vary in the frequency with which they worry and there is large variation in the degree to which this worry disrupts their everyday functioning. Heightened tendency to experience disruptive worry is characterised by an attentional bias towards threat. While this attentional bias is often considered maladaptive, it can be adaptive when it concerns threat cues signalling dangers that can be mitigated through personal action. In this case, the resulting worry may increase the likelihood of this action being taken, with beneficial rather than disruptive consequences for everyday functioning. Thus, depending on its focus, attentional bias to threat could potentially drive worry that is high or low in disruptiveness. The current study addressed this possibility, by testing the novel hypothesis that the degree to which worry is disruptive is a function of the degree to which this attentional bias concerns all threat cues, rather than being restricted to threat cues signalling controllable dangers. Participants completed a novel probe task assessing their attention to threat cues signalling a future danger that could be controlled on some blocks, but not on others. Thus, the task revealed the degree to which their selective attention to threat cues was 'aligned' with danger controllability, by being more evident on blocks that permitted participant control of the danger signalled by the threat cues. The results indicate, contradicting the hypothesis under test, participants who reported high levels of disruptive worry demonstrated alignment of attentional bias to variations in danger controllability, whereas this was not the case for participants who reported high levels of non-disruptive worry. While caution is needed in the interpretation of the results due to methodological limitations, this study provides a new conceptual and methodological framework for future research on the attentional basis of individual differences in the tendency to experience disruptive vs non-disruptive worry."
https://openalex.org/W3161908080,"In concrete structures (concrete), damage from cracks, deterioration, amorphization, and delamination occur in some structures, causing disaggregation (concrete changed to very fine particles) and hollowing out of the concrete. In concrete pavements, damage from large amounts of pop-out of aggregate occurs from the surface of the concrete pavement 4–5 hours after spraying of snow melting agent on the surface of the pavement. The damage from disaggregation, blistering, cracks, and peeling-off of a surface course have also been observed in asphalt runways and highways. The damage from disaggregation, cracks and pop-out of aggregate in asphalt pavements and concrete structures have long been seen as strange and unexpected and have defied explanation. As a result of examinations in various experiments, it was concluded that all of the unexplained kinds of damage of both asphalt pavements and concrete structures were caused by Trace Quantities of Organic Matter (TQOM), Air Entrained (AE) water reducing agent in air and/or cement, and surfactant in snow melting agent. The emission sources of TQOM and these organic substances were also identified by chemical analysis for these unexpected and unexplained phenomena. The TQOM includes phthalate compounds (phthalates in the following), amine compounds, phosphate compounds, snow melting agent and Sodium Polyoxyethylene Nonyl phenyl Ether Sulfate (SPNES). SPNES is a surfactant in windshield washer fluid for automobiles. We found that the water content and content of organic matter in damaged asphalt pavements and concrete structures are also important indicators for the damage. Further, a new evaluation method for amorphization was proposed in this study and it appears suitable for evaluating the safety of concrete structures along roads which were exposed to TQOM in severely air-polluted environments."
https://openalex.org/W3162324826,"Accurate inferences of the emotional state of conversation participants can be critical in shaping analysis and interpretation of conversational exchanges. In qualitative analyses of discourse, most labelling of the perceived emotional state of conversation participants is performed by hand, and is limited to selected moments where an analyst may believe that emotional information is valuable for interpretation. This reliance on manual labelling processes can have implications for repeatability and objectivity, both in terms of accuracy, but also in terms of changes in emotional state that might go unnoticed. In this paper we introduce a qualitative discourse analytic support method intended to support the labelling of emotional state of conversational participants over time. We demonstrate the utility of the technique using a suite of well-studied broadcast interviews, taking a particular focus on identifying instances of inter-speaker conflict. Our findings indicate that this two-step machine learning approach can help decode how moments of conflict arise, sustain, and are resolved through the mapping of emotion over time. We show how such a method can provide useful evidence of the change in emotional state by interlocutors which could be useful to prompt and support further in-depth study."

A multivariate Cox proportional-hazards-model analysis was performed to identify predictive factors of UEVT complete recanalization.This study included 494 UEVT, 304 proximal UEVT and 190 distal UEVT. The median age was 58 years, 39.5% were women. Clinical context was: hematological malignancy (40.7%), solid cancer (14.2%), infectious or inflammatory context (49.9%) and presence of venous catheters or pacemaker leads in 86.4%. The rate of recanalization without sequelae of UEVT was 38%. For all UEVT, in multivariate analysis, factors associated with complete vein recanalization were: thrombosis associated with central venous catheter (CVC) (HR:2.40, [1.45;3.95], p<0.001), UEVT limited to a venous segment (HR:1.94, [1.26;3.00], p = 0.003), occlusive thrombosis (HR:0.48 [0.34;0.67], p<0.0001), the presence of a PICC Line (HR:2.29, [1.48;3.52], p<0.001), a thrombosis of deep and distal topography (HR:1.70, [1.10;2.63], p = 0.02) or superficial thrombosis of the forearm (HR:2.79, [1.52;5.12], p<0.001).

https://openalex.org/W3162962154,"Calcified artery lesions cause stent under-expansion and increase the risk of in-stent restenosis and stent thrombosis. Cutting balloons facilitate the fracturing of calcification prior to stent implantation, although vessel dissection and perforation are potential issues. In clinical practice, calcifications having maximum calcium angles ≤ 180° are rarely fractured during conventional balloon angioplasty. We hypothesize that the lesion/device diameter ratio and the number of blades facing a non-circular calcified lesion may be crucial for fracturing the calcification while avoiding vessel injury. The geometries of the cutting balloons were constructed and their finite-element models were generated by folding and wrapping the balloon model. Numerical simulations were performed for balloons with five different diameters and two types of blade directions in a 180° calcification model. The calcification expansion ability was distinctly higher when two blades faced the calcification than when one blade did. Moreover, when two blades faced the calcification model, larger maximum principal stresses were generated in the calcification even when using undersized balloons with diameters reduced by 0.25 or 0.5 mm from the reference diameter, when compared with the case where one blade faced the calcified model and a balloon of diameter equal to the reference diameter was used. When two blades faced the calcification, smaller stresses were generated in the artery adjacent to the calcification; further, the maximum stress generated in the artery model adjacent to the calcification under the rated pressure of 12 atm when employing undersized balloons was smaller than that when only one blade faced the calcification and when lesion-identical balloon diameters were used under a nominal pressure of 6 atm. Our study suggested that undersized balloons of diameters 0.25 or 0.5 mm less than the reference diameter might be effective in not only expanding the calcified lesion but also reducing the risk of dissection."
https://openalex.org/W3161770133,"Spotty liver disease (SLD) is a bacterial disease of chicken, causing mortalities and reduction in egg production, hence, contributing to economic loss in the poultry industry. The causative agent of SLD has only recently been identified as a novel Campylobacter species, Campylobacter hepaticus. Specific primers were designed from the hsp60 gene of Campylobacter hepaticus and PCR followed by high-resolution melt curve analysis was optimised to detect and differentiate three species of Campylobacter (Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter hepaticus). The three Campylobacter species produced a distinct curve profile and was differentiated using HRM curve analysis. The potential of the PCR-HRM curve analysis was shown in the genotyping of 37 Campylobacter isolates from clinical specimens from poultry farms. PCR-HRM curve analysis of DNA extracts from bile samples or cultures from bile samples, were identified as Campylobacter hepaticus and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The DNA sequence analysis of selected samples from each of the three HRM distinctive curves patterns showed that each DNA sequence was associated with a unique melt profile. The potential of the PCR-HRM curve analysis in genotyping of Campylobacter species was also evaluated using faecal specimens from 100 wild birds. The results presented in this study indicate that PCR followed by HRM curve analysis provides a rapid and robust technique for genotyping of Campylobacter species using either bacterial cultures or clinical specimens."
https://openalex.org/W3162766954,"Decades of research have established a link between emotional disorders and attentional biases for emotional stimuli, but the relationship between symptom severity and visual attention is still not fully understood. Depression has been associated with increased attention towards dysphoric stimuli and decreased attention on positive stimuli (“negativity bias”), and some studies have also shown this trend in anxiety disorders. We examined eye fixation variables in 47 participants with emotional disorders completing an emotion recognition task. Results showed that depression severity was not associated with increased fixations on dysphoric stimuli, however, higher levels of generalized anxiety predicted increased fixations in the mouth region of sad and happy faces. Higher levels of social interaction anxiety predicted reduced fixations in the eye region of happy faces. While we did not replicate the negativity bias that has been shown in prior studies, our sample was highly comorbid, indicating the need to consider comorbidity, disorder severity, and the task itself when conducting research on visual attention in clinical samples. Additionally, more attention should be paid to the mouth region of emotional faces, as it may provide more specific information regarding the visual processing of emotions."
https://openalex.org/W3162976850,"The BC Centre for Disease Control implemented the Facility Overdose Response Box (FORB) program December 1st, 2016 to train and support non-healthcare service providers who may respond to an overdose in the workplace. The program aims to support staff at non-profit community-based organizations by ensuring policy development, training, practice overdose response exercises, and post-overdose debriefing opportunities are established and implemented.Three data sources were used in this descriptive cross-sectional study: FORB site registration data; naloxone administration forms; and a survey that was distributed to FORB sites in February 2019. FORB program site and naloxone administration data from December 1st, 2016 to December 31st, 2019 were analyzed using descriptive statistics. A Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess trends over time in naloxone administration event characteristics. Site coordinator survey results are reported to supplement findings from administrative data.As of December 31st, 2019, FORB was implemented at 613 sites across BC and 1,758 naloxone administration events were reported. The majority (86.3%, n = 1,517) were indicated as overdose reversals. At registration, 43.6% of sites provided housing services, 26.3% offered harm reduction supplies, and 18.6% provided Take Home Naloxone. Refusal to be transported to hospital following overdose events when emergency services were called showed an increasing trend over time. Most respondents (81.3%) reported feeling confident in their ability to respond to the overdose and 59.6% were offered staff debrief. Based on the 89 site survey responses, supports most commonly made available following an overdose were debrief with a fellow staff member (91.0%), debrief with a supervisor (89.9%), and/or counselling services (84.3%).The uptake of the FORB program has contributed to hundreds of overdose reversals in community settings in BC. Findings suggest that the FORB program supports developing staff preparedness and confidence in overdose response in community-based settings."
https://openalex.org/W3163855404,"Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are an important research application of artificial intelligence. In particular, the deep learning-based object detection method is widely used in UGV-based environmental perception. Good experimental results are achieved by the deep learning-based object detection method Faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN). However, the exploration space of the region proposal network (RPN) is restricted by its expression. In our paper, a boosted RPN (BRPN) with three improvements is developed to solve this problem. First, a novel enhanced pooling network is designed in this paper. Therefore, the BRPN can adapt to objects with different shapes. Second, the expression of BRPN loss function is improved to learn the negative samples. Furthermore, the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is used to optimize the parameters of the improved BRPN loss function. Thereafter, the performance of the BRPN loss function is promoted. Third, a novel GA-SVM classifier is applied to strengthen the classification capacity. The PASCAL VOC 2007, VOC 2012 and KITTI datasets are used to test the BRPN. Consequently, excellent experimental results are obtained by our deep learning-based object detection method."
https://openalex.org/W3110082465,"Moderate cases account for the majority in hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and can also progress to severe/critical condition. Here, we investigated the clinical course and management of hospitalized moderate SARS-CoV-2 patients. The medical records and follow-up data were analyzed from the SARS-CoV-2 patients outside Wuhan. A total of 73 moderate patients (38 men, 35 women) were included, with median age of 47.0 (38.5–57.5) years. Among them, only one patient (1.4%) died using active treatment to improve symptoms. The median duration of the four main symptoms cough, fever, chest tightness, and fatigue were 11.0, 8.0, 11.0, and 7.0 days, respectively; the median duration of the positive nucleic acid test (NAT) results for SARS-CoV-2 was 16.5 days; the median hospitalization time was 25.0 days in 72 moderate survivors. The duration of cough and fever was positively correlated with the duration of the positive NAT results. On admission, 50% had lymphopenia; less than 30% had abnormal blood biochemistry findings involving hyperglycemia, liver function and myocardial enzymes. At discharge, the laboratory indexes were substantially improved. Two weeks after discharge, 5.6% survivors experienced a recurrence of the positive NAT results. Moderate SARS-CoV-2 patients have a good prognosis by the active treatment. A small proportion of the recovered moderate patients still may be virus carriers and require an additional round of viral detection."
https://openalex.org/W3160179250,"This paper proposes an adaptive power allocation and subcarrier pairing algorithm for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing based decode and forward cognitive radio networks, where primary and secondary users achieve spectrum sharing in the same frequency band. The secondary network tries to maximize its sum rate while ensuring that the interference introduced to the primary network is below an acceptable level. Although similar problems have been investigated in traditional cooperative communication networks, it's still an open issue in cognitive radio networks due to interference thresholds. The power consumed by the secondary network is not only limited by its own power peak, but also by the interference threshold of the primary user. Our proposed algorithm not only allocates power and pairs subcarriers reasonably, but also specifies the conditions under which the relaying link is superior to the direct transmission. Simulation results show that the sum rate of the proposed algorithm exceeds other methods and obtains a significant performance gain."
https://openalex.org/W3160630487,"Measuring implicit attitudes is difficult due to social desirability (SD). A new method, the Emotion Based Approach (EBA), can solve this by using emotions from a display of faces as response categories. We applied this on an EBA Spirituality tool (EBA-SPT) and an Actual Situation tool (EBA-AST). Our aim was to assess the structure, reliability and validity of the tools and to compare two EBA assessment approaches, i.e., an explicit one (only assessing final replies to items) and an implicit one (assessing also the selection process).We obtained data on a sample of Czech adults (n = 522, age 30.3±12.58; 27.0% men) via an online survey; cortisol was assessed in 46 participants. We assessed the structure and psychometric properties (internal consistency and test-retest reliability; convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity) of the EBA, and examined the differences between explicit vs. implicit EBA approaches.We found an acceptable-good internal consistency reliability of the EBA tools, acceptable discriminant validity between them and low (neutral expression) to good (joy) test-retest reliability for concrete emotions assessed by the tools. An implicit EBA approach showed stronger correlations between emotions and weaker convergent validity, but higher criterion validity, than an explicit approach and standard questionnaires.Compared to standard questionnaires, EBA is a more reliable approach for measuring attitudes, with an implicit approach that reflects the selection process yielding the best results."
https://openalex.org/W3161112741,"In both clinical and preclinical scenarios, 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) is the radiotracer most widely used to study brain glucose metabolism with positron emission tomography (PET). In clinical practice, there is a worldwide standardized protocol for preparing patients for [18F]FDG-PET studies, which specifies the room lighting. However, this standard is typically not observed in the preclinical field, although it is well known that animal handling affects the biodistribution of [18F]FDG. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of ambient lighting on brain [18F]FDG uptake in mice. Two [18F]FDG-PET studies were performed on each animal, one in light and one in dark conditions. Thermal video recordings were acquired to analyse animal motor activity in both conditions. [18F]FDG-PET images were analysed with the Statistical Parametric Mapping method. The results showed that [18F]FDG uptake is higher in darkness than in light condition in mouse nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, midbrain, hindbrain, and cerebellum. The SPM analysis also showed an interaction between the illumination condition and the sex of the animal. Mouse activity was significantly different (p = 0.01) between light conditions (632 ± 215 s of movement) and dark conditions (989 ± 200 s), without significant effect of sex (p = 0.416). We concluded that room illumination conditions during [18F]FDG uptake in mice affected the brain [18F]FDG biodistribution. Therefore, we highlight the importance to control this factor to ensure more reliable and reproducible mouse brain [18F]FDG-PET results."
https://openalex.org/W3161697586,"Atherosclerotic vascular disease resulting from unstable plaques is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and thus a major therapeutic goal is to discover T2D drugs that can also promote atherosclerotic plaque stability. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2 or MK2) in obese mice improves glucose homeostasis and enhances insulin sensitivity. We developed two novel orally active small-molecule inhibitors of MK2, TBX-1 and TBX-2, and tested their effects on metabolism and atherosclerosis in high-fat Western diet (WD)-fed Ldlr -/- mice. Ldlr -/- mice were first fed the WD to allow atherosclerotic lesions to become established, and the mice were then treated with TBX-1 or TBX-2. Both compounds improved glucose metabolism and lowered plasma cholesterol and triglyceride, without an effect on body weight. Most importantly, the compounds decreased lesion area, lessened plaque necrosis, and increased fibrous cap thickness in the aortic root lesions of the mice. Thus, in a preclinical model of high-fat feeding and established atherosclerosis, MK2 inhibitors improved metabolism and also enhanced atherosclerotic plaque stability, suggesting potential for further clinical development to address the epidemic of T2D associated with atherosclerotic vascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W3162396377,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether novice, intermediate, and advanced bouldering athletes would differ in their decision-making abilities and to what extent distinct problem-solving tactics would affect the athletes’ bouldering performances. Seventy-seven male bouldering athletes participated in a multi-experimental study with the conceptual replication of three bouldering tasks. Participants were allocated according to their ability levels to the novice group (NOV with n = 18), the intermediate group (INT with n = 18), or the advanced group (ADV with n = 41). The data collected for movement analysis via video consisted of the pre-ascent decision-making times, the number of movement deviations from the best solution, the number of movement mistakes, the average gripping times, the bouldering times to the top, the number of successful ascents, and the number of attempts to complete the tasks. Results among all three experiments revealed shorter decision-making times, fewer movement mistakes, and shorter average gripping and bouldering times to the top in the ADV group than in the NOV group and the INT group. Furthermore, participants from the ADV group demonstrated fewer movement deviations than participants from the NOV group (in all three experiments) and the INT group (Experiment 1 and Experiment 2). Moreover, participants from the ADV group and the INT group were characterized, in all three experiments, by a higher number of successful ascents and a lower number of attempts to complete the tasks than participants from the NOV group. In total, these findings emphasize that accomplished decision-making abilities consist of a key determinant in successful indoor bouldering performances."
https://openalex.org/W3162819310,"Scout images of lumbar spine MRI often include the extraspinal organs, which are barely included in routine MRI and can be a potential cause of lumbar pain.To evaluate the readability of scout images for extraspinal organs in lumbar spine MRI according to different protocols.A total of 150 patients who underwent 1.5 T or 3 T lumbar spine MRI from March to September 2015 at three hospitals with different scout image protocols, were selected. Two radiologists independently reviewed the scout images to investigate whether exclusive diagnosis of major diseases involving the femoral head, femoral neck, sacroiliac joint, and kidneys was possible. Readability levels were divided into four categories: definitely, possibly, limited, and non-evaluable. The readability of scout images according to the protocols was compared using Chi-square test. Interobserver agreement for the readability level of scout images was assessed using weighted κ statistics.Of 150 patients, ""definitely evaluable"" cases classified by two readers were 50-62 (33.3-41.3%) for femoral head (κ = 0.63-0.71), 37-66 (24.7-44.0%) for femoral neck (κ = 0.41-0.48), 72-93 (48.0-62.0%) for sacroiliac joint (κ = 0.35-0.37), and 63-73 (42.0-48.7%) for kidneys (κ = 0.45-0.47). More than 50% of femoral heads were classified as readable (definitely or possible evaluable) cases by two readers with excellent interobserver agreement. The readability level of scout images was significantly different according to image protocols including the MRI sequence, number of coronal plane slices, and intersection gap of coronal plane slices (p≤0.015).Scout images of lumbar spine MRI may be readable enough to rule out some major diseases of extraspinal organs. Standardization of the protocol will be needed to validate the potential role of scout images for screening extraspinal organs."
https://openalex.org/W3162923974,"A major outbreak of the Ebola virus occurred in 2014 in Sierra Leone. We investigate the spatial heterogeneity of the outbreak among districts in Sierra Leone. The stochastic discrete-time susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model is used, allowing for probabilistic movements from one compartment to another. Our model accounts for heterogeneity among districts by making use of a hierarchical approach. The transmission rates are considered time-varying. It is investigated whether or not incubation period, infectious period and transmission rates are different among districts. Estimation is done using the Bayesian formalism. The posterior estimates of the effective reproductive number were substantially different across the districts, with pronounced variability in districts with few cases of Ebola. The posterior estimates of the reproductive number at the district level varied between below 1.0 and 4.5, whereas at nationwide level it varied between below 1.0 and 2.5. The posterior estimate of the effective reproductive number reached a value below 1.0 around December. In some districts, the effective reproductive number pointed out for the persistence of the outbreak or for a likely resurgence of new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD). The posterior estimates have shown to be highly sensitive to prior elicitation, mainly the incubation period and infectious period."
https://openalex.org/W3163177815,"Knowledge on prescribed medication is important for medication adherence. We determined the presence of cognitive impairment in neurological patients who report not to know reasons and dosages of their medication. Data from 350 patients were collected: sociodemographic data, German Stendal Adherence to Medication Score (SAMS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Eighty-eight (29.0%) patients did not know the reasons for taking their prescribed medication and 83 (27.4%) did not know the doses. Sixty-three (20.8%) knew neither reasons nor dosage. The latter were characterized by higher nonadherence, higher number of prescribed medication per day, lower MoCA, higher BDI, and had more often a lower education level compared with patients who knew the reasons. The MANOVA revealed a significant multivariate effect for not knowing the reasons and not knowing the dosages of medication on MoCA and BDI. Significant univariate effects for not knowing reasons were found for depressive mood, but not for cognitive performance. Significant univariate effects for not knowing dosages were found for cognitive performance, but not for depressive mood. Inaccurate medication reporting is not solely associated with cognitive problems, but also with depression, which has to be taken into account in daily practice and research."
