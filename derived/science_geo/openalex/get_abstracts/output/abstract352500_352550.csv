Utilizing in vitro and in vivo experimental systems, we show that normal and cancer human mammary epithelial cells with increased aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH) have stem/progenitor properties. These cells contain the subpopulation of normal breast epithelium with the broadest lineage differentiation potential and greatest growth capacity in a xenotransplant model. In breast carcinomas, high ALDH activity identifies the tumorigenic cell fraction, capable of self-renewal and of generating tumors that recapitulate the heterogeneity of the parental tumor. In a series of 577 breast carcinomas, expression of ALDH1 detected by immunostaining correlated with poor prognosis. These findings offer an important new tool for the study of normal and malignant breast stem cells and facilitate the clinical application of stem cell concepts.

Although the concept that cancers arise from “stem” or “germ cells” was first proposed almost 150 years ago, it is only recently that advances in stem cell biology generated the experimental framework necessary to test this hypothesis (Reya et al., 2001Reya T.

Stem cell origin of cancer and differentiation therapy.Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2004; 51: 1-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). According to the cancer stem cell model, tumors originate in either tissue stem cells or progenitor cells through deregulation of the normally tightly regulated process of self-renewal (Molofsky et al., 2004Molofsky A.V. Pardal R. Morrison S.J. Diverse mechanisms regulate stem cell self-renewal.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 700-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, Passegue et al., 2003Passegue E. Jamieson C.H. Ailles L.E. Weissman I.L. Normal and leukemic hematopoiesis: Are leukemias a stem cell disorder or a reacquisition of stem cell characteristics?.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 11842-11849Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Self-renewal is the process by which stem cells generate progeny identical to themselves. Stem cells also differentiate to generate multipotent progenitors, which in turn give rise to committed progenitors and differentiated cells. Cancer stem cells share these properties with their normal counterparts: they have self-renewal capacity, driving tumorigenicity, recurrence, and metastasis, and they have the capacity to differentiate, albeit aberrantly, giving rise to a heterogeneous population of cancer cells. The differentiated cells constitute the bulk of the tumor, but they are not tumorigenic due to their lack of self renewal capacity and limited proliferation potential. Experimental evidence supporting the cancer stem cell hypothesis was first generated in 1997 by Dick's group, who demonstrated that human leukemias are driven by a small population of leukemic stem cells capable of transferring the disease to NOD/scid mice (Bonnet and Dick, 1997Bonnet D. Dick J.E. Human acute myeloid leukemia is organized as a hierarchy that originates from a primitive hematopoietic cell.Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (5128) Google Scholar). This concept was extended to solid tumors by Clarke and Wicha. They demonstrated that human breast cancers contain a cell population with stem cell properties bearing the surface markers CD44+/CD24–/lin– (Al-Hajj et al., 2003Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S.

USA. 2003; 100: 3983-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (7896) Google Scholar). Subsequently, cancer stem cells have been identified and prospectively isolated from a variety of malignancies, including brain cancers, prostate cancer, melanoma, multiple myeloma, colon, pancreatic, and head and neck cancers (Collins et al., 2005Collins A.T.

It is likely that cancer stem cells have a phenotype defined by the cell of origin (stem cells or early progenitor cells) and by the oncogenic events that contributed to transformation. Recent studies have provided evidence that supports this concept (Jamieson et al., 2004Jamieson C.H. Ailles L.E. Dylla S.J. Muijtjens M. Jones C. Zehnder J.L. Gotlib J. Li K. Manz M.G.

Genet. 2002; 3: 179-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). One approach for finding shared cancer stem cell markers is to focus on conserved stem and progenitor cell functions. These functional markers may be inherited by the malignant stem cell compartment across multiple histological subtypes of cancer from the same tissue of origin. A candidate marker which fits this description is aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), a detoxifying enzyme responsible for the oxidation of intracellular aldehydes (Duester, 2000Duester G.

Chang C. Human aldehyde dehydrogenase gene family.Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). ALDH may have a role in early differentiation of stem cells through its role in oxidizing retinol to retinoic acid (Chute et al., 2006Chute J.P. Muramoto G.G. Whitesides J. Colvin M. Safi R.

USA. 2006; 31: 11707-11712Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar). It has been shown that murine and human hematopoietic and neural stem and progenitor cells have high ALDH activity (Armstrong et al., 2004Armstrong L. Stojkovic M. Dimmick I. Ahmad S. Stojkovic P.

Characterization of clonogenic multiple myeloma cells.Blood. 2004; 103: 2332-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Increased ALDH activity has also been found in stem cell populations in multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Matsui et al., 2004Matsui W. Huff C.A. Wang Q. Malehorn M.T. Barber J. Tanhehco Y. Smith B.D. Civin C.I. Jones R.J.

Characterization of cells with a high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity from cord blood and acute myeloid leukemia samples.Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). ALDH activity may thus provide a common marker for both normal and malignant stem and progenitor cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that cells with ALDH activity isolated from normal human breast have phenotypic and functional characteristics of mammary stem cells. Moreover, the ALDEFLUOR-positive cells isolated from human breast tumors contain the cancer stem cell population. We also demonstrate that both normal and malignant human mammary stem cells may be identified in situ using immunostaining. Analyzing the expression of ALDH1 in 577 human breast carcinomas from two patient populations, we show that the expression of this stem/progenitor cell marker is a powerful predictor of poor clinical outcome. These findings provide support for the “cancer stem cell hypothesis” and open new possibilities for the study of mammary stem/progenitor cells and their role in mammary development and carcinogenesis. In addition, ALDH1 immunodetection is a simple method for identifying cancer stem/progenitor cells in situ, facilitating the clinical application of stem cell concepts. Single cell suspensions of normal mammary epithelial cells were obtained by mechanical and enzymatic digestion of breast reduction samples, as previously described (Stingl et al., 1998Stingl J. Eaves C.J. Kuusk U. Emerman J.T. Phenotypic and functional characterization in vitro of a multipotent epithelial cell present in the normal adult human breast.Differentiation. 1998; 63: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar; see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). We utilized the ALDEFLUOR assay to assess the presence and size of the population with ALDH enzymatic activity in normal human breast epithelium. Analysis of breast reduction samples from 14 different patients showed an average of 8% (8.18 ± 4.31, n = 14) ALDEFLUOR-positive population in normal mammary epithelial cells (Figures 1A and 1B). Using previously established in vitro and in vivo assays (Dontu et al., 2003Dontu G. Abdallah W.M. Foley J.M. Jackson K.W. Clarke M.F. Kawamura M.J. Wicha M.S.

Chavarria T. Wu M. Magrane G. Gray J.W. Carey L. Richardson A. Weinberg R.A. Reconstruction of functionally normal and malignant human breast tissues in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, Stingl et al., 2006Stingl J. Eirew P. Ricketson I. Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Choi D. Li H.I. Eaves C.J. Purification and unique properties of mammary epithelial stem cells.Nature. 2006; 439: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar), we showed that functional characteristics associated with adult stem cells are displayed by the ALDEFLUOR-positive, but not the ALDEFLUOR-negative, population. The ALDEFLUOR-positive population (Figures 1C–1E), but not the ALDEFLUOR-negative population (Figures 1D and 1E), isolated from fresh mammoplasty samples was capable of generating mammospheres in suspension culture at a density of 5000 cells/ml with a frequency of approximately 4% (Figure 1E), in three consecutive passages. Similar results were obtained when cells were plated in 96-well plates, 1 cell/well. The ALDEFLUOR-positive cells generated mammospheres with an efficiency of 10 ± 3.5%, whereas the ALDEFLUOR-negative cells generated no spheres, and the unseparated cells generated spheres with an efficiency of 0.5 ± 0.2%. The difference between the low density culture and single cell/well culture may be due to a degree of cell aggregation occurring in the former. These results are consistent with our previous findings showing that mammary epithelial cells that survive and proliferate in anchorage-independent conditions are likely to be breast stem cells with self-renewal capacity (Dontu et al., 2003Dontu G. Abdallah W.M. Foley J.M. Jackson K.W. Clarke M.F. Kawamura M.J. Wicha M.S. In vitro propagation and transcriptional profiling of human mammary stem/progenitor cells.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1253-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Similar results were reported by studies in different tissues (Li et al., 2003Li H. Liu H. Heller S. Pluripotent stem cells from the adult mouse inner ear.Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). ALDEFLUOR-positive cells sorted from dissociated mammospheres were capable of self-renewal in vitro, as shown by similar mammosphere-initiating capacity in multiple passages (Figure 1E). The cell lineage composition of the mammospheres was conserved upon serial passages. ALDEFLUOR-positive cells were enriched 10-fold in clonogenicity in suspension compared to unseparated cells. In a clonogenic assay that assesses the lineage differentiation potential of single cells, the ALDEFLUOR-positive cells were enriched in bilineage progenitor cells that generated mixed ESA+/CD10+ colonies (Figure 1F–1I). Figure 1I shows the numbers of myoepithelial, luminal epithelial, and mixed lineage colonies generated by ALDEFLUOR-positive and ALDEFLUOR-negative cells. The mixed lineage colonies represented 67.2 ± 3.5% of the total number of colonies generated by ALDEFLUOR-positive cells (237 ± 15 mixed colonies/1000 cells plated), whereas they represented only 9.1 ± 1.3% of the colonies generated by ALDEFLUOR-negative cells (7 ± 2 colonies/1000 cells plated) (Figure 1I). Differentiation potential of ALDEFLUOR-positive and -negative populations was also assessed by flow cytometry analysis of lineage-specific markers expressed in the progeny of these cells generated in cultivation conditions that promote differentiation. Previous studies by Stingl et al. showed that in the human mammary epithelium uncommitted progenitors double negative for CD10 and ESA generate double negative progenitors bearing both markers. Subsequently, these give rise to the single positive, lineage-committed progenitors. (Stingl et al., 1998Stingl J. Eaves C.J. Kuusk U. Emerman J.T. Phenotypic and functional characterization in vitro of a multipotent epithelial cell present in the normal adult human breast.Differentiation. 1998; 63: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Our results showed that, consistent with the findings of the clonogenic assay, the ALDEFLUOR-positive population was enriched in progenitors cells, which generated uncommitted progeny (15.3 ± 3.2%, CD10−/ESA−; 21.2 ± 1.5%, CD10+/ESA+), myoepithelial (2.1 ± 0.3%, CD10+/ESA−), and luminal epithelial cells (63.2 ± 4.1%, CD10−/ESA+) (Figure 1J, left panel). The ALDEFLUOR-negative population was highly enriched in progenitors restricted to the luminal epithelial cell fate (93.5 ± 3.4%, CD10−/ESA+) (Figure 1J, right panel). We utilized the mouse model described by Kuperwasser et al. to evaluate the ability of sorted cells from normal breast epithelium to grow and differentiate in vivo (Kuperwasser et al., 2004Kuperwasser C. Chavarria T. Wu M. Magrane G. Gray J.W. Carey L. Richardson A. Weinberg R.A. Reconstruction of functionally normal and malignant human breast tissues in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). ALDEFLUOR-positive, ALDEFLUOR-negative, and unseparated cells were transplanted into humanized cleared mammary fat pads of NOD/scid mice (25,000, 5,000, and 500 ALDEFLUOR-positive cells; 50,000, 5,000 and 500 ALDEFLUOR-negative cells; and 25,000, 5,000, and 500 unseparated cells) (Figure 2A). Experiments were performed in triplicate. All the cell subpopulations, including the unseparated cells, were stained with propidium iodide (PI) for viability and sorted by side and forward scatter and viability using flow cytometry (Figure S5). Only ALDEFLUOR-positive and unseparated cells had outgrowth potential, as shown by duct formation upon implantation of 25,000 cells (Figures 2B–2J). Moreover, the ALDEFLUOR-positive cell population was considerably enriched in in vivo outgrowth capability because it consistently generated 10-fold more ducts in the humanized area of the mammary fat pad, compared to the unseparated population (Figures 2K–2L). The ALDEFLUOR-negative population failed to repopulate the fat pads, even when 50,000 cells were injected (data not shown). We validated the human origin of the epithelial outgrowths by immunostaing with a human-specific antibody anti-ESA (Figures 3A–3D). As is the case in the human mammary tree, these small ducts generated in the animal host were composed of a luminal epithelial layer, expressing CK18, and an outer myoepithelial cell layer, expressing smooth muscle actin (SMA) (Figure 3E). This outer layer was not generated by myofibroblastic conversion because it stained double-positive for CK14 and SMA (Figure 3I). We also documented the cell lineage evolution by showing the presence of progenitor cells identified by double-positive staining with luminal and basal markers, such as CK14/CK18, CK18/CK17, and CK18/CK5/6 (Figures 3F–3H) (Villadsen et al., 2007Villadsen R.

Taken together, the results of the in vivo and in vitro assays indicate that the ALDEFLUOR-positive cells represent the cell population with the broadest differentiation potential in vitro and highest growth potential in vivo. We next investigated whether ALDH1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) could be used to detect mammary stem/progenitor cells in situ. We utilized flow cytometry analysis to determine the overlap between the cell population with a high ALDH enzymatic activity (ALDEFLUOR-positive) and the population immunostained by ALDH1. The ALDEFLUOR-positive and -negative populations from normal breast epithelium were isolated by FACS, fixed, and stained with an ALDH1 monoclonal antibody. The cells detected by immunostaining were all contained in the ALDEFLUOR-positive population, whereas the ALDEFLUOR-negative population contained no ALDH1-positive cells (Figures S1A–S1C). We confirmed the results of this analysis by immunostaining separated ALDEFLUOR-positive and -negative cells on cytospins (Figures S1D and S1E). Immunostaining of paraffin-embedded sections of normal breast epithelium using the ALDH1 antibody identified a relatively rare population of ALDH1-positive cells located in the terminal ductal lobular units (TDLUs). ALDH1-positive cells appeared to form a bridge in the lumen that could be located at the bifurcation point of side branches in the TDLUs (Figures 4A–4C; Figure S2). This is consistent with recent published data that show that human stem/progenitor cells are localized in the ductal part of the TDLU structures (Villadsen et al., 2007Villadsen R. Fridriksdottir A.J. Ronnov-Jessen L. Gudjonsson T. Rank F. LaBarge M.A. Bissell M.J. Petersen O.W. Evidence for a stem cell hierarchy in the adult human breast.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A stem cell marker would not be expected to colocalize with markers of mature differentiated mammary epithelial cells. We performed double staining with ALDH1 and CK18, a marker of luminal epithelial cells and ALDH1 and SMA, a marker of myoepithelial cells. The ALDH1-positive cells did not colocalize with CK18 or SMA in sections through normal human breast epithelium (Figures 4E and 4F). Although the phenotype of normal stem and/or progenitor cells from the human breast epithelium has not been identified, several markers including CK5/6 and CK14 have been found to be associated within undifferentiated mammary epithelial cells (Boecker et al., 2002Boecker W. Moll R. Dervan P. Buerger H. Poremba C. Diallo R.I. Herbst H. Schmidt A. Lerch M.M. Buchwalow I.B. Usual ductal hyperplasia of the breast is a committed stem (progenitor) cell lesion distinct from atypical ductal hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ.J. Pathol. 2002; 198: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, Gudjonsson et al., 2002Gudjonsson T. Villadsen R. Nielsen H.L. Ronnov-Jessen L. Bissell M.J. Petersen O.W. Isolation, immortalization, and characterization of a human breast epithelial cell line with stem cell properties.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We did not detect overlapping expression between CK5/6 or CK14 and ALDH1 in sections through normal human breast epithelium (data not shown). To determine if this was a result of the scarcity of these populations, we repeated the same analysis on mammosphere sections. We have shown previously that mammospheres generated from normal mammary epithelium are enriched in stem/progenitor cells (Dontu et al., 2003Dontu G. Abdallah W.M. Foley J.M. Jackson K.W. Clarke M.F. Kawamura M.J. Wicha M.S. In vitro propagation and transcriptional profiling of human mammary stem/progenitor cells.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1253-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). The ALDH1-positive cells represented approx 5% of the mammosphere cell population (Figure 4D). A subset of these ALDH1-positive cells expressed CK5/6 or CK14 (Figures 4G and 4H). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ALDH1-positive cells represent the stem/progenitor population of the normal human breast epithelium. To investigate the tumorigenicity of the ALDEFLUOR-positive population in breast cancers, we established xenotransplants from four independent human breast cancers (MC1, UM1, UM2, and UM3). Cells from these tumors were transplanted orthotopically in the humanized cleared fat-pad of NOD/scid mice, without cultivation in vitro. The tumors were invasive ductal carcinomas, three ER-PR-ERBB2- (MC1, UM1, and UM3) and one ER+PR+ERBB2− (UM2). The tumorigenicity of the sorted ALDEFLUOR populations was assessed in early passages in animals. In contrast to assays that test tumorigenicity of sorted populations directly from patient tumors, this experimental design minimizes the bias introduced by the variable ability of breast cancers to xenotransplant. We found that the ALDEFLUOR-positive population in these three tumors represented 3% to 10% of the total cell population (Figures 5A and 5B; Figure S3). We performed serial passages in vivo, using limiting dilutions of ALDEFLUOR-positive, -negative, and unseparated cells (50,000 cells, 25,000 cells, 5,000 cells, and 500 cells). Experiments were performed in triplicate. For each of the four tumors and for each of the three passages performed, only the ALDEFLUOR-positive population formed tumors, even when implanted in low numbers (Table S1; Figure S3). As shown in Figure 5D, the size and latency of tumor formation correlated with the number of ALDEFLUOR-positive cells injected. Remarkably, 500 ALDEFLUOR-positive cells generated a tumor in as few as 40 days. ALDEFLUOR-negative cells failed to reproducibly generate tumors, although limited growth was observed when 50,000 ALDEFLUOR-negative cells were injected. This is consistent with the presence of less than 0.01% contaminating ALDEFLUOR-positive cells, which is within the limits of FACS error. Alternatively, the growth may have been generated by progenitor cells with limited proliferation capacity. This would explain why these tumors could not be passaged more than once when implanted as unseparated cells in the mouse fat pad. H&E staining of the fat-pad sections confirmed that tumors formed by ALDEFLUOR-positive cells contained malignant cells (Figure 5F), whereas only residual Matrigel, apoptotic cells, and mouse tissue were seen at the sites of the ALDEFLUOR-negative cell injections (Figure 5G). No tumors were detected at these sites after 20–34 weeks. Consistent with the ALDEFLUOR-positive popula"

Stem cells have been implicated in pancreatic tumor growth, but the specific role of these cancer stem cells in tumor biology, including metastasis, is still uncertain. We found that human pancreatic cancer tissue contains cancer stem cells defined by CD133 expression that are exclusively tumorigenic and highly resistant to standard chemotherapy. In the invasive front of pancreatic tumors, a distinct subpopulation of CD133(+) CXCR4(+) cancer stem cells was identified that determines the metastatic phenotype of the individual tumor. Depletion of the cancer stem cell pool for these migrating cancer stem cells virtually abrogated the metastatic phenotype of pancreatic tumors without affecting their tumorigenic potential. In conclusion, we demonstrate that a subpopulation of migrating CD133(+) CXCR4(+) cancer stem cells is essential for tumor metastasis. Strategies aimed at modulating the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis may have important clinical applications to inhibit metastasis of cancer stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2024326908,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can become potently immunosuppressive through unknown mechanisms. We found that the immunosuppressive function of MSCs is elicited by IFNgamma and the concomitant presence of any of three other proinflammatory cytokines, TNFalpha, IL-1alpha, or IL-1beta. These cytokine combinations provoke the expression of high levels of several chemokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by MSCs. Chemokines drive T cell migration into proximity with MSCs, where T cell responsiveness is suppressed by nitric oxide (NO). This cytokine-induced immunosuppression was absent in MSCs derived from iNOS(-/-) or IFNgammaR1(-/-) mice. Blockade of chemokine receptors also abolished the immunosuppression. Administration of wild-type MSCs, but not IFNgammaR1(-/-) or iNOS(-/-) MSCs, prevented graft-versus-host disease in mice, an effect reversed by anti-IFNgamma or iNOS inhibitors. Wild-type MSCs also inhibited delayed-type hypersensitivity, while iNOS(-/-) MSCs aggravated it. Therefore, proinflammatory cytokines are required to induce immunosuppression by MSCs through the concerted action of chemokines and NO."
https://openalex.org/W2039551265,"Ectopic expression of the four transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 is sufficient to confer a pluripotent state upon the fibroblast genome, generating induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. It remains unknown if nuclear reprogramming induced by these four factors globally resets epigenetic differences between differentiated and pluripotent cells. Here, using novel selection approaches, we have generated iPS cells from fibroblasts to characterize their epigenetic state. Female iPS cells showed reactivation of a somatically silenced X chromosome and underwent random X inactivation upon differentiation. Genome-wide analysis of two key histone modifications indicated that iPS cells are highly similar to ES cells. Consistent with these observations, iPS cells gave rise to viable high-degree chimeras with contribution to the germline. These data show that transcription factor-induced reprogramming leads to the global reversion of the somatic epigenome into an ES-like state. Our results provide a paradigm for studying the epigenetic modifications that accompany nuclear reprogramming and suggest that abnormal epigenetic reprogramming does not pose a problem for the potential therapeutic applications of iPS cells."
https://openalex.org/W2129644533,"A novel paradigm in tumor biology suggests that cancer growth is driven by stem-like cells within a tumor. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of such cells from colon carcinomas using the stem cell marker CD133 that accounts around 2% of the cells in human colon cancer.

Xenografts resemble the original human tumor maintaining the rare subpopulation of tumorigenic CD133+ cells. Further analysis revealed that the CD133+ cells produce and utilize IL-4 to protect themselves from apoptosis.

Our data suggest that colon tumor growth is dictated by stem-like cells that are treatment resistant due to the autocrine production of IL-4. Colorectal cancer is the third most common visceral malignancy and remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths due to therapy resistance (Greenlee et al., 2001Greenlee R.T. Hill-Harmon M.B. Murray T. Thun M. Cancer statistics, 2001.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2001; 51: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar). Normal homeostasis in the intestinal tract is regulated by a careful balance between cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Although this balance is clearly disturbed in colorectal cancer, closer examination of tumors from the colon reveals that there is heterogeneity within such tumors that may in part be due to (aberrant) differentiation of cancer cells. Until a few years ago, all neoplastic cells within a tumor were suggested to contain tumorigenic growth capacity, but recent evidence hints to the possibility that this is confined to a small subset of cancer-initiating cells, so-called cancer stem cells (CSC) (Presnell et al., 2002Presnell S.C.

Weissman I.L. Stem cells, cancer, and cancer stem cells.Nature. 2001; 414: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (7396) Google Scholar). The first evidence for the existence of CSC was obtained in the context of acute myeloid leukemia, where only a small portion of harvested leukemic cells from patients could recapitulate the same cancer in immune-deficient mice (Bonnet and Dick, 1997Bonnet D. Dick J.E. Human acute myeloid leukemia is organized as a hierarchy that originates from a primitive hematopoietic cell.Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (5128) Google Scholar). Later on, CSC were also demonstrated to exist in breast (Dontu et al., 2004Dontu G. El-Ashry D. Wicha M.S. Breast cancer, stem/progenitor cells and the estrogen receptor.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 15: 193-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and brain tumors (Singh et al., 2004Singh S.K. Hawkins C. Clarke I.D. Squire J.A. Bayani J. Hide T.

These cells express markers of stemness and are also capable to reproduce the human cancer in mouse models. Other reports extend this principle to prostate (Collins et al., 2005Collins A.T.

More recently, two reports showed the existence of CSC in colon carcinoma using CD133 as a marker (O'Brien et al., 2007O'Brien C.A. Pollett A. Gallinger S. Dick J.E. A human colon cancer cell capable of initiating tumor growth in immunodeficient mice.Nature. 2007; 445 (Published online November 19, 2006): 106-110https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05372Crossref PubMed Scopus (3302) Google Scholar, Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2007Ricci-Vitiani L.

CD133 is infrequently expressed in normal colon tissues as compared with the tumor tissues (O'Brien et al., 2007O'Brien C.A. Pollett A. Gallinger S. Dick J.E. A human colon cancer cell capable of initiating tumor growth in immunodeficient mice.Nature. 2007; 445 (Published online November 19, 2006): 106-110https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05372Crossref PubMed Scopus (3302) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that colon cancer is organized in a hierarchical fashion in which the CD133+ tumor cells act as stem-like cells and thereby give rise to more differentiated tumor cells. However, the nature of these undifferentiated colon cancer cells and the sensitivity of these cells for treatment requires further investigation. CSC are hypothesized to be inert to toxic environmental agents due to high expression levels of ABC transporters, active DNA-repair capacity, and resistance to apoptosis (Dean et al., 2005Dean M. Fojo T. Bates S. Tumor stem cells and drug resistance.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (2858) Google Scholar). Alterations in the apoptotic machinery have been related to chemoresistance in several tumor types (Johnstone et al., 2002Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Lowe S.W. Apoptosis: A link between cancer genetics and chemotherapy.Cell. 2002; 108: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). We recently described the resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis due to elevated expression of antiapoptotic proteins, associated to the autocrine production of IL-4 (Stassi et al., 2003Stassi G. Todaro M. Zerilli M. Ricci-Vitiani L. Di Liberto D. Patti M. Florena A. Di Gaudio F. Di Gesu G. De Maria R.

IL-4 has previously been reported to induce apoptosis resistance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cell and to enhance antiapoptotic protein expression in normal and transformed lymphocytes (Dancescu et al., 1992Dancescu M. Rubio-Trujillo M. Biron G. Bron D. Delespesse G. Sarfati M. Interleukin 4 protects chronic lymphocytic leukemic B cells from death by apoptosis and upregulates Bcl-2 expression.J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), as well as in prostate, breast, and bladder tumor cell lines (Conticello et al., 2004Conticello C. Pedini F. Zeuner A. Patti M. Zerilli M. Stassi G. Messina A. Peschle C. De Maria R. IL-4 protects tumor cells from anti-CD95 and chemotherapeutic agents via up-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins.J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5467-5477PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that IL-4 enhances proliferation of human pancreatic cancer cells, whereas blockage of this cytokine on these tumor cells has a significant growth-inhibitory effect (Prokopchuk et al., 2005Prokopchuk O. Liu Y. Henne-Bruns D. Kornmann M. Interleukin-4 enhances proliferation of human pancreatic cancer cells: Evidence for autocrine and paracrine actions.Br. J. Cancer. 2005; 92: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that IL-4 may promote cancer cell survival through upregulation of antiapoptotic genes. Given this evidence, we defined the tumorigenic stem-like cell population present in colorectal carcinoma and analyzed whether this population is more resistant to current therapies. Moreover, we analyzed whether CSC can be sensitized to undergo growth inhibition and cell death by neutralizing the IL-4 pathway. Several colon cancer specimens were characterized by alcian blue and hematoxylin and eosin stainings; by immunohistochemistry for CK20, CK7, the Ki67 antigen and the homeodomain transcription factor CDX2 (Figure 1A); and were typed for microsatellite instability (MSI) (Table 1). Moreover, these tumors were analyzed for the expression of CD133, a putative stem cell marker. Five (24%) tumors from our cohort were MSI-high (MSI-H), six (28%) tumors were MSI-low (MSI-L), and nine (48%) lacked MSI (MSS) (Table 1). The CD133 cell antigen, which is expressed on hematopoietic stem cells (Yin et al., 1997Yin A.H. Miraglia S. Zanjani E.D. Almeida-Porada G. Ogawa M. Leary A.G. Olweus J. Kearney J. Buck D.W.

A further analysis achieved on freshly purified cells from these tumors revealed that the percentage of CD133+ cells in all patients ranges between 0.3%–3% (Table 1 and Figure 1C left panel).Table 1Case Description and Tumor FeaturesPatientAge/SexSiteDukesSpheres FormationCD133 (%)MSICD133-Derived SpheresAnti-IL-4 SensitizationP165/Mrecto-sigmoidByes1.8MSI-LnoyesP270/MsigmaCno0.3MSSnontP355/FleftAno1.2MSSnoyesP468/FsigmaBno1MSSnontP566/Frecto-sigmoidCyes1.4MSI-LnoyesP658/MsigmaAno0.8MSSnontP765/FsigmaDyes1.3MSI-HyesyesP857/FleftDyes1.5MSI-HyesyesP973/FrightBno0.3MSSnoyesP1063/Mrecto-sigmoidByes1.9MSI-HnoyesP1176/MrightBno3MSI-LnoyesP1270/FsigmaAno1MSSnoyesP1368/Mrecto-sigmoidDyes0.9MSI-LnonoP1457/Mrecto-sigmoidCyes1.3MSI-HyesyesP1576/FsigmaCno1MSSnoyesP1656/FleftBno2.1MSI-LnoyesP1775/FleftCno1.8MSSnonoP1874/FsigmaDno1.2MSSnoyesP1956/FsigmaDyes1.5MSI-LnoyesP2068/Mrecto-sigmoidDyes1.7MSI-HyesyesP2156/FleftDyes2.4MSSyesyesFlow cytometry analysis for CD133 was performed on freshly purified cells from human colon tumors. Open table in a new tab Flow cytometry analysis for CD133 was performed on freshly purified cells from human colon tumors. To determine whether such CD133+ cells have tumorigenic capacity and thus, in analogy with previous findings, are required for successful xenotransplantation, we digested primary tumor samples and analyzed their ability to grow subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice. Freshly dissociated cells from human cancer specimens (bulk) injected at 0.5 or 2 × 106 cells per mouse were capable of establishing subcutaneous tumors (Figure 1D). However, depletion of the CD133+ cells (≤0.08%; Figure 1C) from the same tumor samples using magnetic bead cell sorting drastically reduced tumor formation (Figure 1D). The failure of the CD133− population to form tumors after xenotransplantation was not due to a complete depletion of cancer cells during the cell sorting procedure, as more than 60% of the remaining CD133− cells were mutant for P53 in four screened tumors (see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online) and both p53 and k-ras mutations were detected in the CD133− cells (Table S1). These observations confirm that CD133− tumor cells do not induce tumor formation, while as little as 2.5 × 103 or 5 × 103 of the purified CD133+ cells, either derived from MSI or MSS tumors, readily form tumors (Figure 1D). The xenografts tumors that resulted from injection of CD133+ cells presented the same histopathology features as their respective human tumor and were composed of CD133+/CD133− ratios similar to that observed in the original tumors. Taken together, our data confirm recent observations indicating the potential of CD133+ cells to drive tumor growth (O'Brien et al., 2007O'Brien C.A. Pollett A. Gallinger S. Dick J.E. A human colon cancer cell capable of initiating tumor growth in immunodeficient mice.Nature. 2007; 445 (Published online November 19, 2006): 106-110https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05372Crossref PubMed Scopus (3302) Google Scholar, Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2007Ricci-Vitiani L.

In an attempt to keep the colon cancer cells in culture for additional characterization, freshly purified cells were seeded under standard adherent conditions. These cultures were all characterized by clusters of polygonals cells (Figure 2A, left panels) that grew up to about 2 weeks. The adherent cells were positive for CDX2, cytokeratin-AE (CKAE), CK20, and β-catenin, whereas CK7 was undetectable, which is a typical pattern for colorectal cells (Figure 2A, left panels). Intriguingly, none of the cells in such culture conditions was positive for CD133 (Figure 2D and data not shown). In contrast, when colon carcinoma samples from the same patients were dissociated into single cells and cultured in a serum-free medium containing EGF and FGF-2, a sphere-like culture was obtained with a frequency of 10 out of 21 tumors (45%) (Table 1; Figure 2B, left panel). The sphere-like aggregates could be expanded for several months in this medium in line with previous reports on neural and mammary stem cells (Dontu et al., 2003Dontu G. Abdallah W.M. Foley J.M. Jackson K.W. Clarke M.F. Kawamura M.J. Wicha M.S.

Identification of human brain tumor initiating cells.Nature. 2004; 432: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (5681) Google Scholar). Spheroid growth appeared to be more effective when using MSI tumors, but is not exclusive for such tumors (Table 1). These spheroid cultures were all characterized by cells with round shape that were negative for CDX2, CK20, and CK7, but positive for CD133 (Figures 2A and 2B). As assessed by FACS analysis, about 90% of the spheroid cells were positive for CD133 protein (Figure 2C). Further immunoblot analyses assessed on control, cancer adherent cells and cancer spheres confirmed the expression of CD133 on cancer spheroid cells (Figure 2D), indicating that spheroid cultures contain cells that have the same cell surface marker as the CSC observed within the original tumor. In agreement, these spheroid cultures can be directly derived from the CD133+ colon cancer cells as purified CD133+ cells from 5 out of 21 different tumor specimens formed spheroids and grew exponentially as undifferentiated cells. This latter capacity seems to correlate with MSI-high tumors, although it is also observed with one MSS colon carcinoma (Table 1). Spheroid cultures that were supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) for up to 21 days initially displayed adherence to the culture dishes and subsequently differentiated into large, polygonal colon cells starting from week 1, a phenotype similar to that of the adherent primary cultures (Figure S2A). More importantly, when colon cancer spheroids were cultured in the presence of FBS in matrigel, which represents a reconstituted 3D culture system, colonies that were generated were organized in a complex structure reminiscent of a colonic crypt (Figure 2E; Figure S2B, upper panels), whereas primary cancer cells from the adherent cultures failed to form these structures (Figure S2B, lower panels). These crypt-like structures were positive for alcian blue, CK20, and β-catenin, while CD133 expression was gradually lost (Figure 2E). We therefore conclude that colon cancer spheroids represent a subpopulation of cells that contain stem-like features and have the capacity to differentiate in vitro into luminal structures. Subcutaneous injection of low numbers of spheres confirmed that the spheroid cells retain the capacity to initiate tumor growth in nude mice (Figure 2F; Figure S2C; Table 2). As little as 500 spheroid cells were sufficient to obtain tumor growth (Figure S2C), while 2 × 106 adherent cells were ineffective (Figure 2F). Histological examination of xenografts derived from spheroid cultures showed that these tumors closely resemble the original human tumor mainly containing differentiated cells and a small fraction of stem-like cells expressing CD133 marker (Figure S2D). Importantly, spheroid cultures can be rederived from the xenotransplantated tumors (Figure S2E), and these retain the stem-like features as they will form tumors that have the original morphology upon reinjection (Figure S2F). These data therefore indicate that the CD133+ cells within colon carcinoma can be propagated in spheroid cultures, represent cancer stem-like cells that contain tumorigenic capacity, can be reisolated and transplanted from xenografts, and are able to differentiate in vitro and in vivo.Table 2Tumorigenicity of CD133+ and Spheroid-Initiating Colon Cancer CellCancer SourcePatientsCell Number InjectedXenograft FormationEngraftment-Derived SpheresBulkP1-5-7-8-10-13-14-15-17-19-20-215 × 105yesyes2 × 106yesyesSpheresP1-5-7-8-10-13-14-19-20-2125yesyes50yesyesCD133+P1-5-7-8-10-13-15∗This experiment was done using 3.5 × 103 and 7 × 103 CD133+ cells.-19-212.5 × 103yesyes5 × 103yesyesCD133−P1-5-7-8-10-13-19-212 × 106no/Adherent cellsP1-5-7-8-10-13-14-15-17-19-20-212 × 106no/∗ This experiment was done using 3.5 × 103 and 7 × 103 CD133+ cells. Open table in a new tab Since cancer stem cells are thought to be particularly resistant to drug treatments, we analyzed the cell viability of primary colon cancer cells following exposure to oxaliplatin and/or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at clinically relevant doses or after exposure to the death ligand TRAIL. Cancer cells or purified CD133− cells from the same human colon cancer specimens showed a high sensitivity in vitro to both drugs tested in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 3A). The observed sensitivity of the CD133− cells was not due to death of nontumor cells within this subpopulation as a clear reduction in the number of P53 mutant cancer cells was detected (Figure S1B). In contrast, CD133+ cells were largely inert to chemotherapeutic drugs-induced apoptosis even at the highest dose concentrations used (Watanabe et al., 2006Watanabe T. Komuro Y. Kiyomatsu T. Kanazawa T. Kazama Y. Tanaka J. Tanaka T. Yamamoto Y. Shirane M. Muto T. Nagawa H. Prediction of sensitivity of rectal cancer cells in response to preoperative radiotherapy by DNA microarray analysis of gene expression profiles.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3370-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The ED80 values indicate an approximate 60- and 15-fold difference for 5-FU and oxaliplatin, respectively (Figure 3A). Previously, we described that autocrine production of IL-4 strongly modulates death receptor- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (Stassi et al., 2003Stassi G. Todaro M. Zerilli M. Ricci-Vitiani L.

Receptors for IL-4 are expressed on hematopoietic cells and a range of nonhematopoietic cells including epithelial, endothelial, muscle, fibroblast, and liver cells. On nonhematopoietic cells, the receptor complex for IL-4 (type II) is predominantly composed of the IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1 chains which heterodimerize upon either IL-4 or low-affinity IL-13 binding (Mentink-Kane et al., 2004Mentink-Kane M.M.

Another glycoprotein chain implicated in the IL-4R system, but with higher affinity for IL-13, is the IL-13Rα2 chain described to act as strong inhibitor of the IL-13 signaling by functioning as a decoy receptor (Rahaman et al., 2002Rahaman S.O. Sharma P. Harbor P.C. Aman M.J. Vogelbaum M.A. Haque S.J. IL-13R(alpha)2, a decoy receptor for IL-13 acts as an inhibitor of IL-4-dependent signal transduction in glioblastoma cells.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1103-1109PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, colon cancer samples clearly displayed high levels of IL-4 expression (Figures 3C–3F; Table S2), which was absent in normal colon (Figure 3C). In addition, IL-4-receptor (IL-4Rα) expression was also detected in colon cancer specimens (Figure 3C). IL-4 and IL-4Rα were also expressed on cells of spheroid cultures and on freshly purified CD133+ cells (Figures 3C–3F). In contrast, the IL-4-related cytokine, IL-13, was undetectable on normal and colon cancer epithelial cells, neither on CD133+ nor in cancer spheroid cells (Figures 3G and 3H; Figure S1C; Table S2), while it was expressed on smooth muscle and infiltrating gut lamina propria cells of the normal mucosa (data not shown) (Morimoto et al., 2006Morimoto M. Morimoto M. Zhao A. Madden K.B. Dawson H. Finkelman F.D. Mentink-Kane M. Urban Jr., J.F. Wynn T.A. Shea-Donohue T. Functional importance of regional differences in localized gene expression of receptors for IL-13 in murine gut.J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 491-495PubMed Google Scholar). IL-13Rα2, the decoy for IL-13, was clearly present in colon epithelial cells, but higher in normal than in colon cancer cells (Figures 3G and 3H). Combined, these data suggest that colon cancer cells may display autocrine IL-4 signaling. To investigate whether IL-4 constitutes a survival factor for CD133+ cells, we pretreated freshly isolated cells with IL-4-neutralizing antibody, and then drug resistance of CD133+ cells was evaluated. When anti-IL-4 antibody was followed by oxaliplatin, 5-FU or TRAIL treatment resulted in a significantly enhanced overall cell death rate (Figure 3B). Best results were obtained when anti-IL-4 was combined with either oxaliplatin plus 5-FU (p < 0.001) or oxaliplatin alone (p < 0.001) with no significant difference between both treatments (Figure 3B). Similarly, anti-IL-4-induced sensitization to drugs was also observed in the long-term spheroid cultures (Figures 4A and 4B), and even anti-IL-4 antibody alone showed a small but consistent decrease in the viable cell number (Figure 4A), suggesting that IL-4 is required for the survival of CD133+ cells. Mechanistically, we found that anti-IL-4 treatment resulted in a decreased expression of the antiapoptotic proteins cFLIP, Bcl-xL, and PED by about 2-fold (Figure 4C), which may point to an IL-4-induced antiapoptotic program. These findings indicate that IL-4 protects CD133+ cells and could thus dictate therapy refractoriness, possibly through the upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we analyzed whether IL-4 blockade enhances chemotherapy efficacy. Since IL-4 and IL-13 share a common receptor subunit (IL-4Rα), an efficient way to block cytokine-induced proliferation in xenotransplants would be to disrupt ligands/receptor interaction. We used a high affinity antagonist of IL-4Rα characterized by amino acid replacements in two different positions of the IL-4 molecule (IL-4DM) as strategy to inhibit both IL-4 and IL-13 responses (Grunewald et al., 1998Grunewald S.M. Werthmann A. Schnarr B. Klein C.E. Brocker E.B. Mohrs M. Brombacher F. Sebald W. Duschl A. An antagonistic IL-4 mutant prevents type I allergy in the mouse: Inhibition of the IL-4/IL-13 receptor system completely abrogates humoral immune response to allergen and development of allergic symptoms in vivo.J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4004-4009PubMed Google Scholar). Colon cancer spheroids were allowed to grow into the flank of nude mice until they reached a size of ∼0.2 cm3. Tumors formed had the morphological characteristics of adenocarcinomas and mainly contained CD133− cells, whereas only a minority of CD133+ was present. Mice were then treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice a week for 3 weeks with IL-4DM or with PBS starting 24 hr before drug delivery (Figure 5A). In all treated mice, the tumor response to chemotherapeutic drugs was enhanced by IL-4DM. Specifically, IL-4DM cotreatment with oxaliplatin or oxaliplatin plus 5-FU resulted in a marked synergistic effect on tumor control, whereas a less pronounced effect was observed with 5-FU and IL-4DM alone (Figure 5A; Figure S1D). As the colon cancers examined were not producing IL-13, we set out to confirm the role of IL-4 directly with the use of intratumoral injection of neutralizing antibody against IL-4 (twice a week for 3 weeks). PBS and control antibody treatment alone did not prevent tumor outgrowth, and anti-IL-4 only had a marginal effect (Figure 5B). As observed before, intraperitoneal treatment with oxaliplatin alone delayed tumor growth by about 4 weeks, but when treatment was interrupted, tumor growth was as rapid as in the sham-treated mice, as shown by the steepness of the growth curves (Figures 5A and 5B). By contrast, cotreatment with anti-IL-4 strongly enhanced tumor response to chemotherapeutics, similar to the IL-4DM effect (Figure 5B). This data suggests that although standard chemotherapeutic drugs delay tumor outgrowth during the treatment, when they are combined with IL-4DM or with IL-4 neutralizing antibody, the efficacy of chemotherapy is significantly enhanced and also more sustained after treatment interruption (Figures 5A and 5B). The mechanism of in vivo cell death sensitization of cancer cells to drugs-induced apoptosis was evaluated using immunohistochemical analysis of anti-IL-4 treated tumors. TUNEL staining, which reveals apoptotic cells, several days after the last oxaliplatin treatment, confirmed that anti-IL-4 plus oxaliplatin resulted in a significant higher number of apoptotic events compared to oxaliplatin treatment alone (Figure 5C). TUNEL costaining with CD133 to identify apoptosis in the stem cell compartment is feasible and showed TUNEL posi"

Here we show that Foxo3a, a forkhead transcription factor that acts downstream of the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway, is critical for HSC self-renewal. We generated gene-targeted Foxo3a−/− mice and showed that, although the proliferation and differentiation of Foxo3a−/− hematopoietic progenitors were normal, the number of colony-forming cells present in long-term cocultures of Foxo3a−/− bone marrow cells and stromal cells was reduced. The ability of Foxo3a−/− HSCs to support long-term reconstitution of hematopoiesis in a competitive transplantation assay was also impaired. Foxo3a−/− HSCs also showed increased phosphorylation of p38MAPK, an elevation of ROS, defective maintenance of quiescence, and heightened sensitivity to cell-cycle-specific myelotoxic injury. Finally, HSC frequencies were significantly decreased in aged Foxo3a−/− mice compared to the littermate controls. Our results demonstrate that Foxo3a plays a pivotal role in maintaining the HSC pool.

FOXO transcription factors belong to the forkhead family of transcriptional regulators that is characterized by a conserved DNA binding domain termed the “forkhead box” (Kaestner et al., 2000Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Unified nomenclature for the winged helix/forkhead transcription factors.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar). The FOXO group of human forkhead proteins contains four members: FOXO1, FOXO3a, FOXO4, and FOXO6. FOXO proteins are normally present in an active state in a cell's nucleus. In response to the binding of growth factors or insulin to the appropriate cell surface receptors, the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is triggered. PI3K in turn activates several serine/threonine kinases, including protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) and the related SGK family enzymes (Brunet et al., 1999Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P.

Activated Akt phosphorylates FOXO proteins at three consensus Akt phosphorylation sites, triggering the inactivation of these molecules and their export from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. FOXO proteins have both distinct and overlapping functions, and their many target molecules are involved in processes as diverse as cell-cycle arrest (Dijkers et al., 2000aDijkers P.F. Medema R.H.

SIRT1 is critical regulator of FOXO-mediated transcription in response to oxidative stress.Int. J. Mol. Med. 2005; 16: 237-243PubMed Google Scholar). In Drosophila and C. elegans, FOXO proteins are involved in regulating metabolism, stress resistance, and longevity (Greer and Brunet, 2005Greer E.L. Brunet A. FOXO transcription factors at the interface between longevity and tumor suppression.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7410-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). However, it has yet to be clarified whether FOXO proteins modulate longevity and stress responses in animals. Several mouse models designed to elucidate the physiological functions of the mammalian Foxo genes have been reported. Foxo1−/− mice die at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) due to defective angiogenesis (Furuyama et al., 2004Furuyama T. Kitayama K. Shimoda Y. Ogawa M. Sone K. Yoshida-Araki K. Hisatsune H. Nishikawa S.

Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 2975-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The principal phenotype of Foxo3a−/− mice is an age-dependent female infertility caused by premature activation of the ovarian follicles (Castrillon et al., 2003Castrillon D.H. Miao L. Kollipara R. Horner J.W. DePinho R.A. Suppression of ovarian follicle activation in mice by the transcription factor Foxo3a.Science. 2003; 301: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Foxo3a−/− mice also display hyperproliferation of helper T cells, in line with Foxo3a's known role in promoting cell-cycle arrest (Lin et al., 2004Lin L. Hron J.D. Peng S.L. Regulation of NF-kappaB, Th activation, and autoinflammation by the forkhead transcription factor Foxo3a.Immunity. 2004; 21: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Foxo4−/− mice are viable and do not have an overt phenotype (Hosaka et al., 2004Hosaka T. Biggs III, W.H. Tieu D. Boyer A.D. Varki N.M. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Disruption of forkhead transcription factor (FOXO) family members in mice reveals their functional diversification.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 2975-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Foxo6−/− mice have yet to be reported. Mammalian hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are maintained in an undifferentiated quiescent state in a bone marrow niche (Arai et al., 2004Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K. Koh G.Y. Suda T. Tie2/angiopoietin-1 signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). It is thought that the mechanisms protecting quiescent HSCs against stress may contribute to the maintenance of the self-renewal capacity and life span of HSCs. We have previously demonstrated that the self-renewal capacity of HSCs depends on Atm-mediated inhibition of oxidative stress (Ito et al., 2004Ito K. Hirao A. Arai F. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Hamaguchi I. Nomiyama K. Hosokawa K. Sakurada K. Nakagata N. et al.Regulation of oxidative stress by ATM is required for self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2004; 431: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). In the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the p38MAPK pathway is activated such that the HSC population is exhausted. Prolonged treatment of HSCs with an antioxidant or a p38MAPK inhibitor can extend the life span of these cells during serial transplantation, indicating that p38MAPK inactivation protects HSCs against loss of self-renewal capacity (Ito et al., 2006Ito K. Hirao A. Arai F. Takubo K. Matsuoka S. Miyamoto K. Ohmura M. Naka K. Hosokawa K. Ikeda Y. et al.Reactive oxygen species act through p38 MAPK to limit the lifespan of hematopoietic stem cells.Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that genes or factors related to cellular senescence are involved in regulating the self-renewal capacity of HSCs. In this study, we demonstrate that Foxo3a is an important contributor to the maintenance of the HSC pool during aging. Our findings have implications for the roles of FOXO proteins in maintenance of tissue homeostasis. We generated Foxo3a−/− mice by disrupting exon 2 of the Foxo3a gene with a neo cassette (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online at http://www.cellstemcell.com/content/full/1/1/101/DC1/). Consistent with a previous report (Castrillon et al., 2003Castrillon D.H. Miao L. Kollipara R. Horner J.W. DePinho R.A. Suppression of ovarian follicle activation in mice by the transcription factor Foxo3a.Science. 2003; 301: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), our Foxo3a−/− mice were viable, and female mice showed infertility. To investigate the effect of Foxo3a loss on hematopoiesis, we analyzed the peripheral blood of 8-week-old Foxo3a+/+ and Foxo3a−/− mice. In the latter, we found a decreased number of red blood cells but a significant increase in reticulocytes accompanied by elevations in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) (Table 1). These findings indicate that erythropoiesis is abnormal in the absence of Foxo3a, as previously reported (Bakker et al., 2004Bakker W.J. Blazquez-Domingo M. Kolbus A. Besooyen J. Steinlein P. Beug H. Coffer P.J. Lowenberg B. von Lindern M. van Dijk T.B. FoxO3a regulates erythroid differentiation and induces BTG1, an activator of protein arginine methyl transferase 1.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, numbers of white blood cells and platelets were comparable in our Foxo3a+/+ and Foxo3a−/− mice. In addition, lymphoid and myeloid cells in Foxo3a−/− peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) showed wild-type morphology as determined by May Grunwald-Giemsa staining (data not shown). Moreover, flow cytometric analyses of T cell (CD3+), B cell (B220+), and myeloid (Mac-1/Gr-1+) cell populations in Foxo3a−/− BM showed that these cells were present at wild-type frequencies (Figure S2). These data indicate that the differentiation of all hematopoietic cells save the erythroid lineage is normal in Foxo3a−/− mice.Table 1Blood Cell Counts in 8-Week-Old Foxo3a+/+ and Foxo3a−/− MiceFoxo3a+/+Foxo3a−/−P ValueWBC (μl)11,000 ± 4,70013,000 ± 3,100NSRBC (×104/μl)884 ± 79780 ± 70<0.01Hb (g/dl)13.9 ± 1.014.0 ± 1.0NSHCT (%)44.9 ± 2.544.7 ± 2.4NSMCV (fl)51.0 ± 2.557.5 ± 3.2<0.01MCH (pg)15.8 ± 0.818.0 ± 1.0<0.01PLT (×104/μl)85.2 ± 12.481.0 ± 15.9NSRet (‰)7.5 ± 0.557.5 ± 0.5<0.01Values shown are the mean ± SD for 20 mice per genotype.

Next, we investigated the quality and quantity of hematopoietic progenitors in 8- to 12-week-old Foxo3a−/− mice. To evaluate the clonogenic capacity and differentiation potential of myeloid and erythroid progenitors, we performed colony-forming assays in vitro in which freshly isolated BM mononuclear cells (MNCs) were cultured for 7 days in methylcellulose medium supplemented with stem cell factor (SCF), thrombopoietin (TPO), erythropoietin (Epo), and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). The numbers and sizes of myeloid (colony-forming unit granulocytes/macrophage, CFU-GM), erythroid (burst-forming unit-erythroid, BFU-E), and mixed (CFU-mix) colonies derived from Foxo3a+/+ and Foxo3a−/− BM MNCs were comparable (Figure 1A). The capacity of Foxo3a−/− BM cells to form colonies in the spleen 12 days after transplantation (CFU-S12; short-term repopulating cells) was also equivalent to that of Foxo3a+/+ BM MNCs (Figure 1B). Foxo3a+/+ and Foxo3a−/− BM also contained similar frequencies of c-Kit+Sca-1+Lineage− (KSL) cells, which represent a primitive hematopoietic cell fraction containing HSCs and early progenitors (Figure 1C). Furthermore, Foxo3a+/+ and Foxo3a−/− KSL cells demonstrated comparable proliferation and differentiation potential in colony-forming assays (Figure 1D). Because it had been reported that the activation of FOXO by cytokine depletion leads to cell death in hematopoietic cell lines (Dijkers et al., 2000aDijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim is regulated by the forkhead transcription factor FKHR-L1.Curr.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), we evaluated the apoptosis of immature BM cells (Lineage− cells; Lin−) cultured in the absence of cytokines. However, Foxo3a+/+ and Foxo3a−/− Lin− cells did not differ in their kinetics of apoptosis (Figure 1E). These results indicate that loss of Foxo3a does not affect the proliferation or differentiation potential of hematopoietic progenitors in the BM of healthy mice. To determine if Foxo3a was required for the functions of primitive hematopoietic cells, we carried out long-term cultivation of KSL cells on a layer of OP9 stromal cells. In this assay, the number of colony-forming cells arising after 6 weeks of culture reflects HSC function. The number of colonies derived from Foxo3a−/− KSL cells was significantly decreased compared to that derived from Foxo3a+/+ KSL cells, although short-term cultures (less than 2 weeks) did not show a significant difference (Figure 2A). Thus, the most primitive hematopoietic cells in the BM are profoundly affected by the loss of Foxo3a. To assess the repopulating capacity of Foxo3a−/− HSCs in vivo, we performed a competitive reconstitution assay in which 4 × 105 BM MNCs from a Foxo3a+/+ or Foxo3a−/− mouse (CD45.2) competed against an equal number of BM MNCs from a congenic (CD45.1) mouse to reconstitute the hematopoietic compartment of an irradiated recipient mouse (CD45.1). At 16 weeks posttransplantation, flow cytometric analysis of the peripheral blood of the transplanted recipients revealed that Foxo3a+/+ and Foxo3a−/− BM MNCs were equally capable of hematopoietic reconstitution (Figure 2B). We then analyzed the chimerism of donor-derived cells in the BM and found wild-type numbers of Foxo3a−/−-derived B cells, myeloid cells, and erythroid cells (data not shown) but greatly reduced numbers of KSL cells (Figure 2C). These results indicate that Foxo3a is not crucial for HSC differentiation but plays a critical role in HSC self-renewal. To examine the impact of the reduced KSL population derived from Foxo3a−/− BM cells on hematopoiesis, we carried out second competitive transplantation. At 16 weeks post first BMT, 1 × 106 BM MNCs from these recipients, including donor-derived BM cells (CD45.2), competitor-derived BM cells, and residual recipient BM cells (CD45.1), were transplanted into a second set of recipient mice (CD45.1) (second BMT). At 16 weeks post second BMT, fewer hematopoietic cells in the second recipients were derived from Foxo3a−/− BM MNCs compared to Foxo3a+/+ BM MNCs (Figure 2D), indicating that the reconstituted HSC pool derived from Foxo3a−/− BM cells after the first BMT was decreased. At 16 weeks post third BMT, the proportion of Foxo3a+/+ BM MNC-derived cells was reduced compared to that at 16 weeks post second BMT. This deficit arises presumably because the repopulating capacity of the donor and competitor cells is decreased by repeated BMT, whereas residual recipient BM cells continue to accumulate. Nevertheless, examination of BM cells after a third transplantation revealed a further reduction in the reconstitution capacity of Foxo3a−/− BM cells compared to Foxo3a+/+ BM cells. These data confirm that Foxo3a is essential for the self-renewal capacity of HSCs. We next set out to characterize the cell population most dependent on Foxo3a. As previously reported (Yamazaki et al., 2006Yamazaki S. Iwama A. Takayanagi S. Morita Y. Eto K. Ema H. Nakauchi H. Cytokine signals modulated via lipid rafts mimic niche signals and induce hibernation in hematopoietic stem cells.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), Foxo3a protein is present in the nucleus of freshly isolated Foxo3a+/+ CD34−KSL cells (HSCs) but appears in the cytoplasm of freshly isolated Foxo3a+/+ CD34+KSL cells (progenitors) (Figure 3A). When we evaluated the in vitro clonogenic capacity of purified Foxo3a+/+ CD34+KSL and CD34−KSL cells, we found that CD34+KSL cells generated much larger colonies than did CD34−KSL cells by day 7. However, the clusters (small colonies) derived from CD34−KSL cells caught up in size by day 14, confirming that CD34−KSL cells are less mature than CD34+KSL cells. When we carried out the same clonogenic assay using Foxo3a−/− CD34+KSL and CD34−KSL cells, the numbers of colonies generated by Foxo3a+/+ and Foxo3a−/− CD34+KSL cells were equivalent (Figure 3B). In contrast, the loss of Foxo3a resulted in a mild but significant reduction in the number of clusters derived from CD34−KSL cells. Despite this decrease in number, the differentiation potential of the clusters derived from CD34−KSL cells was not obviously affected by Foxo3a deficiency (Figure S3). These data indicate that loss of Foxo3a results in a defect in in vitro clonogenic capacity that is specific to HSCs. To evaluate HSC function in vivo, we evaluated the repopulating capacity of purified KSL cells using the competitive reconstitution assay. At 4 weeks posttransplantation, the repopulating capacity of Foxo3a−/− KSL cells was comparable to that of Foxo3a+/+ KSL cells, suggesting that loss of Foxo3a does not affect progenitor function (Figure 3C). However, at later time points in the experiment, the repopulating capacity of Foxo3a−/− KSL cells was lower than that of Foxo3a+/+ KSL cells. These data suggested that Foxo3a deficiency might cause an in vivo defect that impaired the function of HSCs but not that of progenitors. To confirm the effect of Foxo3a deficiency on HSC function in vivo, we examined the short-term reconstitution capacity of CD34+KSL progenitors, as well as the long-term reconstitution capacity of CD34−KSL HSCs, in competitive transplantation assays. Foxo3a−/− CD34+KSL cells supported normal reconstitution of hematopoiesis in short-term (4 weeks) experiments (Figure 3D), consistent with our earlier finding that Foxo3a is not involved in CD34+KSL function. In contrast, the loss of Foxo3a in CD34−KSL HSCs led to a significant defect in reconstitution by 16 weeks posttransplantation (Figure 3E), indicating that Foxo3a is essential for the long-term repopulating capacity of HSCs. Since anemia was not observed in recipient mice (data not shown), the defect in the erythroid lineage did not affect the repopulating capacity of Foxo3a−/− HSCs. Thus, Foxo3a−/− mice have a profound defect in HSC function, but not in progenitor function. HSCs are normally maintained in an undifferentiated quiescent state (G0 phase), and this quiescence protects HSCs against losing self-renewal capacity. To evaluate the quiescence status of HSCs in Foxo3a−/− mice, we first examined the cell-cycle status of KSL cells using BrdU (5-bromodeoxyuridine) incorporation. No differences were found between Foxo3a+/− and Foxo3a−/− mice in the percentage of KSL cells that had undergone cell division over a 2 hr period (Figure 4A). Obvious apoptosis was not observed in either Foxo3a+/+ or Foxo3a−/− KSL cells (Figure S4). To directly evaluate HSC quiescence in Foxo3a−/− mice, we stained CD34−KSL cells from Foxo3a+/+ and Foxo3a−/− mice with Pyronin Y, an agent that specifically and quantitatively stains double-stranded RNA and accurately reflects the G0 phase (Huttmann et al., 2001Huttmann A. Liu S.L. Boyd A.W. Li C.L. Functional heterogeneity within rhodamine123(lo) Hoechst33342(lo/sp) primitive hemopoietic stem cells revealed by Pyronin Y.Exp. Hematol. 2001; 29: 1109-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous work (Yamazaki et al., 2006Yamazaki S. Iwama A. Takayanagi S. Morita Y. Eto K. Ema H. Nakauchi H. Cytokine signals modulated via lipid rafts mimic niche signals and induce hibernation in hematopoietic stem cells.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), we found that most Foxo3a+/+ CD34−KSL cells stained negatively for Pyronin Y, indicating normal HSC quiescence. However, a sizable Pyronin Y+ population was detected among Foxo3a−/− CD34−KSL cells (Figure 4B). To investigate whether Foxo3a−/− CD34−KSL cells were cycling in vivo, BrdU was administered to mice orally for 7 days. Whereas Foxo3a+/+ CD34−KSL cells showed minimal BrdU incorporation, almost 60% of Foxo3a−/− cells were BrdU+ (Figure 4C). These results indicate that Foxo3a deficiency drives HSCs to abandon the G0 phase and enter the cell cycle. With respect to the CD34+KSL population, 70%–80% of these cells were BrdU+ in both Foxo3a+/+ and Foxo3a−/− mice. The defect in HSC quiescence in the absence of Foxo3a was further supported by the finding of decreased levels of the negative cell-cycle regulators p27 and p57 in Foxo3a−/− CD34−KSL cells (Figure 4D). Cheng et al. have reported that loss of p21 leads to a failure in the maintenance of HSC quiescence. In this case, when the mutant animals were exposed to the cell-cycle-specific myelotoxic drug 5-FU as an exogenous stress, they died prematurely due to hematopoietic cell depletion (Cheng et al., 2000Cheng T. Rodrigues N. Shen H. Yang Y. Dombkowski D. Sykes M. Scadden D.T. Hematopoietic stem cell quiescence maintained by p21cip1/waf1.Science. 2000; 287: 1804-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to investigate the sensitivity of Foxo3a−/− mice and their hematopoietic cells to weekly 5-FU treatments. Although some 5-FU-treated Foxo3a+/+ mice died at 2 weeks after the initial injection, fully 60% of them survived until at least 4 weeks postinjection (Figure 4E). In contrast, all Foxo3a−/− mice were dead within 4 weeks after the first injection, showing that Foxo3a is required for normal HSC resistance to 5-FU. To exclude the possibility that the death of the mice was due to the toxic effects of 5-FU on other tissues, we repopulated the hematopoietic system of lethally irradiated recipients with either Foxo3a+/+ or Foxo3a−/− BM cells. Four months after transplantation, we challenged the reconstituted mice with weekly 5-FU treatments. A similar increase in mortality was observed in mice transplanted with Foxo3a−/− BM cells as compared to those bearing Foxo3a+/+ BM cells (Figure 4F). Thus, 5-FU-treated Foxo3a−/− mice die prematurely due to effects on the hematopoietic system and not because of the sensitivity of other tissues to the antimetabolite treatment. Foxo3a therefore protects hematopoietic cells from destruction by cell-cycle-dependent myelotoxic agents, and a loss of Foxo3a leads to hematopoietic cell depletion and premature death of the animal. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Foxo3a plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of HSC quiescence and suggest that Foxo3a functions to protect HSCs against exogenous stress. We have previously reported that p38MAPK activation induced by ROS elevation promotes exhaustion of HSCs during serial BM transplantation (Ito et al., 2006Ito K. Hirao A. Arai F. Takubo K. Matsuoka S. Miyamoto K. Ohmura M. Naka K. Hosokawa K. Ikeda Y. et al.Reactive oxygen species act through p38 MAPK to limit the lifespan of hematopoietic stem cells.Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated ROS levels and the activation status of p38MAPK in HSCs of Foxo3a+/+ and Foxo3a−/− mice. ROS was indeed increased in Foxo3a−/− KSL cells compared to Foxo3a+/+ KSL cells (Figure 5A). Moreover, the expression levels of SOD2 and catalase, two Foxo target genes involved in ROS detoxification (Essers et al., 2004Essers M.A. Weijzen S. de Vries-Smits A.M. Saarloos I. de Ruiter N.D.

When p38MAPK phosphorylation was examined in hematopoietic cell subsets of Foxo3a+/+ and Foxo3a−/− mice, fewer than 10% of CD34−KSL cells in Foxo3a+/+ mice showed p38MAPK phosphorylation (Figures 5C and 5D).

We have devised a reprogramming strategy in which these four transcription factors are expressed from doxycycline (dox)-inducible lentiviral vectors. Using these inducible constructs, we derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and found that transgene silencing is a prerequisite for normal cell differentiation. We have analyzed the timing of known pluripotency marker activation during mouse iPS cell derivation and observed that alkaline phosphatase (AP) was activated first, followed by stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA1). Expression of Nanog and the endogenous Oct4 gene, marking fully reprogrammed cells, was only observed late in the process. Importantly, the virally transduced cDNAs needed to be expressed for at least 12 days in order to generate iPS cells.

In initial studies, mouse fibroblasts infected with murine Moloney leukemia virus (MLV)-derived vectors carrying the cDNAs of Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 under the control of the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) region gave rise to ES cell-like iPS cells that were able to differentiate into cell types of all three germ layers and contributed to the germline of chimeric mice (Maherali et al., 2007Maherali N.

DNA methylation and histone modification analyses revealed that the chromatin of mouse iPS cells had been reprogrammed to an embryonic state. This included demethylation of the endogenous promoters controlling the ES cell-specific genes Nanog and Oct4 and the simultaneous establishment of both H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation marks at loci previously identified to be “bivalent” in ES cells (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein B.E.

During the derivation process, iPS cells efficiently downregulated the transcriptional activity of the viral LTRs to basal levels, suggesting that viral transgene expression becomes dispensable at a certain time point during the reprogramming process. Though the isolation of human iPS cells has been achieved recently (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S.

One major obstacle is the stochastic reactivation of the viral transgenes, which has been linked to an elevated frequency of tumor formation in iPS cell-derived chimeric mice (Okita et al., 2007Okita K. Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S. Generation of germline-competent induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3357) Google Scholar). In previous studies, iPS cell colonies were detected at widely differing time points after infection of somatic cells. Depending on the selection strategy employed, cells undergoing reprogramming could be enriched for by drug selection starting as early as on day 3 and as late as several weeks after infection (Maherali et al., 2007Maherali N.

Our recently published data demonstrated that cells originating from the same infected parental cell activate the endogenous Oct4 locus at different time points, suggesting that the induction of pluripotency by viral transduction is a gradual process involving stochastic epigenetic events (Meissner et al., 2007Meissner A.

It is unclear, however, whether the reactivation of pluripotency-associated genes is a random, stochastic process or follows a specific set of sequential events, and the minimal length of transgene expression required for successful reprogramming has not been determined. Understanding the timing of endogenous gene activation and transgene silencing is fundamental for the development of transient, nonviral reprogramming strategies. In order to study the activation of endogenous genes during the reprogramming process and the time requirements for ectopic expression of the four factors, we have developed a lentiviral system in which the cDNAs of the four transcription factors are driven from a dox-inducible promoter. In contrast to previously employed retroviral systems (Maherali et al., 2007Maherali N. Sridharan R. Xie W. Utikal J. Eminli S. Arnold K. Stadtfeld M. Yachechko R. Tchieu J.

We have derived iPS cell lines after infection of fibroblasts obtained from Oct4-GFP mice or Nanog-GFP mice expressing the M2rtTA from the endogenous Rosa26 (R26) promoter. By utilizing inducible viruses, we were able to activate or downregulate the expression of the four factors at different time points and to analyze the timing of the reprogramming process. Using FACS analysis, we assessed the activation of the four ES cell markers AP, SSEA1, Oct4-GFP, and Nanog-GFP and found that SSEA1 expression marks an intermediate state of reprogramming, whereas Oct4 and Nanog expression was only detected in fully reprogrammed cells. We also identified the minimum time of viral transgene expression required for completion of the reprogramming process and determined the effect of continued expression of the four factors on the differentiation potential of several iPS cell lines. A lentiviral backbone for dox-inducible transgene expression was constructed by replacing the human ubiquitin C promoter of the FUW plasmid (Lois et al., 2002Lois C. Hong E.J. Pease S. Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Germline transmission and tissue-specific expression of transgenes delivered by lentiviral vectors.Science. 2002; 295: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar) with a tetracycline operator and minimal CMV promoter. The cDNAs for Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc were subsequently cloned into this backbone. We generated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) carrying the R26 promoter-driven M2rtTA (Beard et al., 2006Beard C. Hochedlinger K. Plath K. Wutz A. Jaenisch R.

M2rtTA+/−;Oct4GFP+/− and M2rtTA+/−;NanogGFP+/− MEFs were infected with inducible Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 viruses and subsequently treated with dox (Figure 1A). To determine the expression levels of the four genes from the inducible viruses, we performed quantitative PCR analysis showing that ectopic transcript expression could be strongly induced in the presence of dox (see Figure S1 available online). To generate iPS cell lines, 2.5 × 105 MEFs were infected in 10 cm cell culture dishes. The cultures were split 1:5 at 3 days after infection. Dox was added to the cell culture medium 1 day following the split to induce transgene expression and initiate the reprogramming process. In the presence of dox, the morphology of the infected MEFs changed within 3 days, with small, rounded cells forming in the culture. Similar to previous observations (Maherali et al., 2007Maherali N.

ES-like colonies were not observed in cultures that had not been treated with dox. We picked single GFP-positive colonies from the dox-treated plates at day 26 and expanded them on feeder MEFs in the absence of dox to derive iPS cell lines (Figure 1B). Viable chimeras were generated from both Oct4-GFP and Nanog-GFP iPS clones after injection into BALB/C blastocysts (Figures 1C and 1D). In order to provide a baseline measure of endogenous ES cell marker activation during the direct reprogramming of MEFs, we performed FACS analyses of AP, SSEA1, and Oct4- or Nanog-driven GFP. For each experiment, Oct4-GFP and Nanog-GFP cells were infected with the same batch of virus to reduce variability. Three days after infection, the MEFs were split onto gelatin-coated 10 cm plates. The next day, dox was added to all plates (day 0). The expression of ES cell-specific markers was analyzed at various time points after dox addition up to day 35. The average percentages of cells expressing AP, SSEA1, Oct4-GFP, or Nanog-GFP from three independent experiments are displayed in Figure 2. Representative FACS plots for AP and SSEA1/Oct4-GFP or SSEA1/Nanog-GFP analysis are displayed in Figure S2. Since the GFP signal to background fluorescence ratio was low, we performed autofluorescence correction as outlined elsewhere (Alberti et al., 1987Alberti S. Parks D.R. Herzenberg L.A. A single laser method for subtraction of cell autofluorescence in flow cytometry.Cytometry. 1987; 8: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous observations (Wernig et al., 2007Wernig M. Meissner A. Foreman R. Brambrink T. Ku M. Hochedlinger K. Bernstein B.E. Jaenisch R. In vitro reprogramming of fibroblasts into a pluripotent ES-cell-like state.Nature. 2007; 448: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar), AP was reactivated early after induction of the four factors and was detectable in a small percentage (∼3%–4%) of cells at day 3. SSEA1 was first expressed in a subpopulation of cells (∼4%) at day 9 and GFP expression from either the Oct4 or Nanog endogenous promoters was first observed by FACS at day 16, with the percentage of GFP-positive cells being below 1% in both cases. We performed quantitative RT-PCR assays on whole-cell populations as well as on SSEA1-positive cells to investigate whether transcriptional activation of the endogenous Nanog or Sox2 loci was detectable before the appearance of GFP-positive cells. We found no significant levels of either transcript at time points up to day 9 of dox induction (Figure S3). The portion of cells expressing AP, SSEA1, or GFP increased in both reporter lines over time, consistent with our previous results (Wernig et al., 2007Wernig M. Meissner A. Foreman R. Brambrink T. Ku M. Hochedlinger K. Bernstein B.E. Jaenisch R. In vitro reprogramming of fibroblasts into a pluripotent ES-cell-like state.Nature. 2007; 448: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). The timing of marker appearance observed by FACS suggests that the activation of AP, SSEA1, Oct4, and Nanog might be sequential events. This notion is supported by the observation that at day 9 after infection only about 7% of the AP-positive cells also expressed SSEA1 and at day 16 only about 3% of the cells staining for SSEA1 also expressed Nanog or Oct4 as indicated by GFP fluorescence. In contrast, most if not all GFP-positive cells also expressed SSEA1. To test the hypothesis that SSEA1 and Oct4/Nanog are sequentially activated, we sorted infected populations of Oct4-GFP and Nanog-GFP cells at day 21 of dox treatment (Figure 3A). Equal numbers of SSEA1+/GFP− cells were plated on feeders and cultured for 3 days either in the presence or in the absence of dox. After 3 days, the medium was changed and the cells were incubated in dox-free medium for an additional 7 days. GFP-positive colonies were observed in both treated and untreated cultures of SSEA1+/GFP− cells (Figure 3B). The percentage of SSEA1+/GFP− cells that were able to generate GFP-positive colonies was calculated. In both the Oct4-GFP and the Nanog-GFP cell populations, ∼0.02% of the SSEA1+/GFP− cells gave rise to GFP-positive colonies without dox treatment. This percentage increased about 10-fold to ∼0.2% when the cells were treated with dox, indicating that continuous expression of the transcription factors enhanced reprogramming in SSEA1+/GFP− cells (Figure 3C). We confirmed the existence of SSEA1+/GFP+ cells in the sorted populations by FACS analysis 11 days after the initial sort (Figure 3D). In contrast to SSEA1+/GFP− cells, SSEA1-/GFP− cells did not give rise to any GFP-positive colonies after 10 days of culturing with or without dox. To investigate whether the SSEA1+/GFP− cells that did not give rise to iPS cell colonies after dox withdrawal simply stopped dividing while maintaining SSEA1 expression or returned to a MEF-like SSEA1-negative state, we sorted cells after 9 days of dox treatment—a time point well before the expression of Nanog-GFP or Oct4-GFP could be detected. The SSEA1+/GFP− cells were seeded onto plates with feeders and cultured for 20 days with or without dox. In addition, some of the SSEA1+/GFP− cells were also seeded onto plates without feeders to allow for the analysis of their morphology. At the end of the culture period, we assessed SSEA1 and GFP expression by FACS analysis (Figure 4A). In contrast to the SSEA1+/GFP− populations sorted at day 21, the populations sorted at day 9 did not give rise to any SSEA1+/GFP+ cells after culturing them without dox, indicating the complete absence of transgene-independent cells within the SSEA1+/GFP− populations sorted at this earlier time point. Furthermore, most if not all cells cultured without dox ceased to express SSEA1 and returned to a MEF-like morphology (Figure 4B). In contrast, when cultured in the presence of dox, the SSEA1+/GFP− cells from day 9 gave rise to iPS colonies and yielded SSEA1+/GFP+ iPS cells at the end of the culture period (Figures 4A and 4B). Our results indicate that SSEA1 activation may represent an intermediate step preceding the activation of Oct4 or Nanog. The SSEA1-positive state seems to be instable, and SSEA1+/GFP− cells separated at day 9 depend on continued transgene expression to complete the reprogramming process. When the transgenes are turned off, the reprogramming process is halted and the cells assume a state resembling that of the donor MEFs. Our findings also indicate that reprogramming is a gradual, asynchronous process and that continuous vector expression enhances reprogramming efficiency even at 21 days after the start of dox induction, a time point well beyond the initial appearance of GFP-positive iPS cells. We investigated how long the exogenous expression of the four factors was required for successful reprogramming of fibroblasts to dox-independent, self-renewing iPS cells. For this, cells were infected with the inducible lentiviruses and split onto six gelatin-coated 10 cm plates 3 days later as outlined in Figure 5A. One day after splitting the cells, dox was added to the culture medium (day 0). The drug was withdrawn from individual cultures at various time points (days 12, 14, 16, 19, 22, and 26), and the dishes were fixed and stained for AP on day 35 (Figure 5A). We found that day 14 was the earliest time point of dox withdrawal that was permissive to the establishment of dox-independent colonies that stained positive for AP (Figure 5A). No dox-independent, AP-positive colonies were observed on plates that had dox withdrawn on day 12 (Figure 5A), even though AP-positive cells were consistently detectable at the time of dox withdrawal in our FACS experiments (compare Figure 2). These initial colonies did not proliferate after dox withdrawal and did not stain for AP at day 35. In the dishes in which dox was withdrawn at later time points, the number of dox-independent, AP-positive colonies increased with the time that the cells were exposed to dox and therefore with the length of transgene expression (Figure 5A). To determine the time point of dox withdrawal at which fully reprogrammed iPS cells could reproducibly be derived, we repeated this experiment in triplicate for both Nanog-GFP and Oct4-GFP cells. This time we withdrew dox on days 9, 12, 14, 16, 21, and 24, respectively, and examined the plates for GFP-expressing iPS colonies on day 35 (Figure 5B). No marked differences in colony counts were detected between Oct4-GFP and Nanog-GFP cells, and the data obtained from both donor cell lines were combined. We observed that dox-independent, GFP-expressing iPS cell colonies could not reliably be detected on plates that had dox removed on or prior to day 12, with four of the six “day 12” plates containing no GFP-positive colonies, one plate containing a single colony, and another plate containing two GFP-positive colonies. Notably, a number of small colonies were visible on these early withdrawal plates at the time of dox removal (Figure S4A). However, these did not resemble ES cell colonies and did not continue to proliferate once dox was withdrawn (Figure S4B). Dox-independent, GFP-positive colonies consistently appeared on plates treated with dox for 16 days or longer, suggesting that some cells on those plates could proliferate and self-renew independently of viral transgene expression.

Sox2-GFP cells in the subgranular zone (SGZ) express markers specific for progenitors, but they represent two morphologically distinct populations that differ in proliferation levels. Lentivirus- and retrovirus-mediated fate-tracing studies showed that Sox2+ cells in the SGZ have potential to give rise to neurons and astrocytes, revealing their multipotency at the population as well as at a single-cell level. A subpopulation of Sox2+ cells gives rise to cells that retain Sox2, highlighting Sox2+ cells as a primary source for adult NSCs. In response to mitotic signals, increased proliferation of Sox2+ cells is coupled with the generation of Sox2+ NSCs as well as neuronal precursors. An asymmetric contribution of Sox2+ NSCs may play an important role in maintaining the constant size of the NSC pool and producing newly born neurons during adult neurogenesis.

An asymmetric contribution of Sox2+ NSCs may play an important role in maintaining the constant size of the NSC pool and producing newly born neurons during adult neurogenesis. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are defined as cells that can self-renew (the capacity to proliferate to produce identical cells) and are multipotent (the potential to give rise to the major neural lineages, including neurons, astrocytes, and/or oligodendrocytes) (Gage, 2000Gage F.H. Mammalian neural stem cells.Science. 2000; 287: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (3974) Google Scholar). During embryogenesis, NSCs are located in the ventricular zone of the neural tube, and they can give rise to all cell types needed for the formation of the central nervous system (CNS). Contrary to the earlier belief that neurogenesis occurs only during development, it has been shown that new neurons are continuously born from NSCs throughout adulthood (Kuhn et al., 1996Kuhn H.G.

USA. 1993; 90: 2074-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). This adult neurogenesis occurs in two restricted brain regions: the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles. The terms “self-renewal” and “multipotency” of adult NSCs have been broadly defined, based primarily upon the characterization of in vitro-cultured NSCs (Reynolds and Weiss, 1992Reynolds B.A. Weiss S. Generation of neurons and astrocytes from isolated cells of the adult mammalian central nervous system.Science. 1992; 255: 1707-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (4416) Google Scholar). Cells that had been prepared from the neurogenic zones or isolated prospectively by virtue of cell-surface markers or GFP expression driven by NSC-specific promoters were plated in the presence of growth factors and examined to determine whether they could expand to form neurospheres or monolayered colonies (Kawaguchi et al., 2001Kawaguchi A.

Med. 2000; 6: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The capacity to form secondary or tertiary neurospheres or attached colonies from the primary clones was defined as self-renewal. The differentiation potential of these cells upon withdrawal of growth factors or administration of inducing factors was used to demonstrate multipotency. However, direct evidence to support the existence of self-renewing and multipotent NSCs in vivo is very limited. Moreover, recent studies have raised the possibility that NSCs established with a systematic exposure to growth factors may not reflect the properties of in vivo NSCs but rather display acquired properties that are not evident in vivo (Gabay et al., 2003Gabay L. Lowell S. Rubin L.L. Anderson D.J.

Thus, to establish a precise relationship between the proliferating cells in the neurogenic zones and the in vitro-cultured cells that arise from them, it is essential to understand the properties of in vivo NSCs. Sox2 is a SRY-related transcription factor encoding a high-mobility group (HMG) DNA-binding motif, and it is expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells and neural epithelial cells during development (Avilion et al., 2003Avilion A.A.

Although genetic examination and analysis of in vitro-cultured cells have implicated Sox2+ cells as NSCs (Bylund et al., 2003Bylund M. Andersson E. Novitch B.G. Muhr J.

Khudyakov J. Ellis P. Pevny L. SOX2 functions to maintain neural progenitor identity.Neuron. 2003; 39: 749-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), no direct in vivo data have demonstrated their self-renewal and multipotency in the adult brain. Here, we hypothesized that Sox2+ cells represent NSCs in the adult hippocampus and tested whether they retain the multipotent and self-renewing properties at a single-cell level. By using transgenic mice in which a GFP reporter gene was expressed under the control of Sox2 promoter (D'Amour and Gage, 2003D'Amour K.A. Gage F.H. Genetic and functional differences between multipotent neural and pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 11866-11872Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), we showed that Sox2+ cells represent an undifferentiated, dividing cell population in the SGZ of adult dentate gyrus. Furthermore, our fate mapping and lineage tracing of Sox2+ cells revealed that Sox2+ cells are capable of producing differentiated neural cells as well as identical Sox2+ cells, demonstrating their self-renewing and multipotent NSC properties at a single-cell level. We also examined the involvement of Sox2+ NSCs in enhanced neurogenesis, when animals were exposed to mitotic signals. The results provide evidence that increased proliferation of Sox2+ NSCs leads to the generation of neuronal precursors as well as the Sox2+ NSC population, but the size of the Sox2+ NSC pool remains unchanged. The contribution of proliferation of the Sox2+ NSCs to the production of differentiated cells in addition to NSCs could be relevant to understanding how the self-renewal of NSCs is coupled with the generation of differentiated cells. We generated transgenic mouse lines harboring enhanced GFP under the control of murine Sox2 promoter (Sox2-GFP) and examined whether Sox2 promoter could drive GFP expression in the adult neurogenic zones. GFP-expressing (GFP+) cells were detected in the SGZ of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (Figure 1A) and the SVZ of the lateral ventricle (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online) in 6-week-old Sox2-GFP mice. In situ hybridization using Sox2 antisense probe confirmed that the GFP expression recapitulated the endogenous Sox2 mRNA expression pattern in the adult brain (Figure 1B). These results show that 5.5 kb Sox2 promoter is sufficient to mimic endogenous Sox2 expression and to label cells residing in the adult neurogenic zones. However, it is noteworthy that some GFP+ cells are also distributed throughout the brain, suggesting that Sox2 is expressed more widely in the adult brain than in the embryonic brain (Figure S2, data not shown) (Ferri et al., 2004Ferri A.L. Cavallaro M. Braida D. Di Cristofano A. Canta A. Vezzani A. Ottolenghi S. Pandolfi P.P. Sala M. DeBiasi S. Nicolis S.K. Sox2 deficiency causes neurodegeneration and impaired neurogenesis in the adult mouse brain.Development. 2004; 131: 3805-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The examination of GFP+ cells by confocal microscopy identified two morphologically distinct cell types in the adult SGZ. One population of GFP+ cells had their cell bodies in the SGZ and displayed a radial glia-like morphology, with a long process across the granular layer of the dentate gyrus (Figure 1C, arrow). This radial morphology is reminiscent of radial glial cells that generate the migrating neurons during embryonic CNS development (Anthony et al., 2004Anthony T.E. Klein C. Fishell G. Heintz N.

In contrast to these radial Sox2-GFP cells, the second population of Sox2-GFP cells also had their cell bodies in the SGZ, but they lacked radial processes. Some of these cells had short processes stretching parallel to the dentate gyrus (Figure 1C, arrowhead). To identify the cell type of GFP+ cells, we first performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) with specific markers for radial glial cells and/or NSCs. Sox2-GFP cells colocalized with radial glial cell markers including NESTIN (Fukuda et al., 2003Fukuda S. Kato F. Tozuka Y. Yamaguchi M. Miyamoto Y. Hisatsune T.

The examination of NESTIN and GFAP in the nonradial Sox2-GFP cells was not feasible, however, due to the lack of signal in the soma. All Sox2-GFP cells in the SGZ were colabeled with MUSASHI-1, which is expressed in postnatal NSCs (Sakakibara and Okano, 1997Sakakibara S. Okano H. Expression of neural RNA-binding proteins in the postnatal CNS: implications of their roles in neuronal and glial cell development.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8300-8312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 1G). IHC with BrdU (Figure 1H, Figure S2) and Ki67 (Figure 1I) showed that a fraction of Sox2-GFP cells was proliferating in the adult SGZ (5.2% ± 2.67% of total Sox2-GFP cells are positive for Ki67, mean ± SEM, n = 5), and these cells corresponded to 23% of total Ki67+ cells. It is noteworthy that only nonradial, but not radial, Sox2-GFP cells were colabeled with the cell proliferation markers. Thus, in our analysis, only nonradial Sox2-GFP cells are proliferating regularly. DOUBLECORTIN (DCX), TuJ1, and NEUN were used to examine whether Sox2-GFP cells represented neuronal precursors, immature and mature neurons, respectively. Most of the Sox2-GFP cells did not colocalize with these markers, indicating that the GFP+ cells in the SGZ do not represent fully differentiated neurons (Figures 1J–1L). A few GFP+ cells were colocalized with DCX (data not shown), but this colocalization always coincided with weaker expressions of GFP and DCX. This finding may reflect the transition from Sox2+ cells to immature DCX+ neurons. S-100β, an astrocyte marker, was not expressed in the Sox2-GFP cells in the SGZ (Figure 1M). However, in rare cases, Sox2-GFP cells positive for S-100β were found deeper in the granular layer or hilus (Figure 1M, arrow). Antisera against NG2 and GST-π were used to examine whether Sox2-GFP cells represented oligodendrocytes. However, Sox2-GFP cells did not colocalize with these markers (Figure 1N). These data collectively suggest that Sox2-GFP cells in the SGZ represent undifferentiated cells with a proliferation capacity, but not differentiated cells. To examine whether hippocampal Sox2-GFP cells could be a source for in vitro NSCs, hippocampal cells were prepared from the transgenic mice and cultured in the presence of FGF2 and EGF (Figure 2A). When hippocampal cells were initially isolated, only 6% (6.1% ± 2.6%, n = 4) of total live cells were GFP+ cells. However, during 4 weeks in culture, Sox2-GFP cells expanded and represented approximately 70% of the total live cells (Figure 2A). In independent experiments, GFP+ cells were sorted by FACS directly from the hippocampus and cultured in bulk or clonally. In both cases, GFP+ cells propagated without losing GFP expression (100%, passage 10, 25, and 35, n = 3 for each passage), and these in vitro-expanded Sox2-GFP cells could be passaged at least 30 times, maintaining their capacity to give rise to neural lineages (see below). The multipotency of Sox2-GFP cells was examined after they were differentiated into neural lineages. Under the growth condition, almost all Sox2-GFP cells expressed the NSC markers, NESTIN and SOX2 (Figure 2C), whereas differentiated neural cell-specific markers were not detected (Figure 2C, data not shown). In the presence of forskolin, Sox2-GFP cells differentiated into neurons positive for TuJ1, MAP2 (Figure 2C, data not shown), and DCX and into astrocytes positive for GFAP (Figure 2C). Oligodendrocyte differentiation was achieved by coculture of Sox2-GFP cells with hippocampal neurons from P0 (postnatal day 0) rats (Song et al., 2002Song H. Stevens C.F. Gage F.H. Astroglia induce neurogenesis from adult neural stem cells.Nature. 2002; 417: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). Sox2-GFP cells were labeled with lentivirus carrying CMV-βgal reporter to distinguish them from the primary culture. Indeed, some βgal+ cells differentiated into RIP+ oligodendrocytes (Figure 2C), demonstrating that Sox2-GFP cells have the potential to give rise to all three major neural lineages. The temporal progress of the differentiation of Sox2-GFP cells was monitored by western blot. Consistent with immunostaining results, GFAP and TUJ1 were not expressed in the undifferentiated Sox2-GFP cells (Figure 2B). Upon differentiation, GFAP expression was immediately induced, followed by TuJ1 expression (Figure 2B). Interestingly, downregulation of SOX2 coincided with TuJ1 induction but was not associated with initial GFAP expression (Bani-Yaghoub et al., 2006Bani-Yaghoub M. Tremblay R.G. Lei J.X. Zhang D. Zurakowski B. Sandhu J.K. Smith B. Ribecco-Lutkiewicz M. Kennedy J. Walker P.R. Sikorska M. Role of Sox2 in the development of the mouse neocortex.Dev. Biol. 2006; 295: 52-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). To trace the fate of Sox2+ cells in vivo, Sox2-Cre/GFP lentivirus was injected into the dentate gyrus of ROSA26-loxP-Stop-loxP-GFP reporter mice (Figure 3A) (Tashiro et al., 2006Tashiro A. Sandler V.M. Toni N. Zhao C. Gage F.H. NMDA-receptor-mediated, cell-specific integration of new neurons in adult dentate gyrus.Nature. 2006; 442: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The detailed information regarding the design of the lentiviral vector and the confirmation of viral specificity is described in the Supplemental Data (Figure S3). The BrdU paradigm was also used to (1) follow only the daughter cells of targeted Sox2+ cells and (2) rule out the tracing fates of off-targeted, nondividing neurons (Supplemental Results, Figure S3). The fate of the daughter cells of Sox2+ cells was examined with cell-type-specific markers. Triple IHC clearly demonstrated that targeted Sox2+ cells (GFP+ reporter) proliferated (BrdU+) and subsequently gave rise to neurons (DCX, NEUROD, or PROX1). The neuronal fates that we observed ranged from neuronal precursors positive for NEUROD (Figure 3B) or DCX (Figure 3C) to granular neurons positive for PROX1 (Figure 3D), CALBINDIN, or NEUN (data not shown). The majority of Sox2+ cells gave rise to granular neurons within 1 month after birth (Table 1). In addition, some daughter cells of targeted Sox2+ cells differentiated to GFAP+ (Figure 3E) or S-100β+ (Figure 3F) astrocytes with a lower frequency (Table 1). The differentiation potential of Sox2+ cells to neurons (≈89%) and astrocytes (≈7%) that we observed is comparable to results from BrdU- or retrovirus-mediated fate mapping of dividing cells in the hippocampus (Steiner et al., 2004Steiner B.

Open table in a new tab The differentiation capacity of progeny of Sox2+ NSCs was examined with cell-type-specific markers, and quantitative results were summarized. Note that the percentages of phenotype do not add up to 100% because IHC with these antibodies was performed individually. We next examined whether proliferation of Sox2+ cells was associated with generation of undifferentiated cells. Indeed, about 10% of the progeny derived from targeted Sox2+ cells maintained SOX2 expression (Figure 3G), and 2% of traced cells expressed the undifferentiated cell marker, BLBP (Figure 3H). These data collectively indicate that Sox2+ cells in the SGZ not only have the potential to give rise to neurons and astrocytes but can also serve as a source for new, undifferentiated cells. While our fate-mapping studies revealed the differentiation potentials of Sox2+ cells as a population, it was unclear whether a single Sox2+ cell retains multipotency in the adult dentate gyrus. Thus, we adapted retroviral-mediated labeling of Sox2+ cells to examine the lineage relation between Sox2+ cells and neural cell types derived from Sox2+ cells in the adult hippocampus (Seri et al., 2004Seri B. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Collado-Morente L. McEwen B.S. Alvarez-Buylla A. Cell types, lineage, and architecture of the germinal zone in the adult dentate gyrus.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 478: 359-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Sox2-Cre/GFP retrovirus was generated to label dividing Sox2+cells exclusively and trace their fates clonally. First, we tested the specific retroviral transduction in Sox2+ cells by double IHC with GFP and SOX2 antibodies. The majority of targeted cells (GFP+) showed specific SOX2 expression when we analyzed them 7 days after retrovirus injection into the dentate gyri of C57BL6 mice (92% ± 1.7%, mean ± SEM, n = 3). Second, the serially diluted Sox2-Cre/GFP retrovirus was injected into the dentate gyri of C57BL/6 mice to titrate the concentration that would produce a small number of clusters. Then we extrapolated the viral concentration that corresponded to generating approximately ten clusters per hemisphere to minimize the mixture of progeny from different Sox2+ cells. We injected 0.5 μl of Sox2-Cre/GFP retrovirus (of ≈5 × 106 colony-forming unit/μl) into both dentate gyri of ROSA26R reporter mice (R = GFP or β-GAL, n = 54 hemispheres), and brains were examined 21 days after viral injection. To identify the composition of cell types in clusters, IHC with cell-type-specific antibodies was performed. This approach generated approximately seven isolated clusters of cells per hemisphere that were likely to be derived from independent Sox2+ cells (Table 2, 6.7 ± 1.5, mean ± SEM, n = 54). Among 363 clusters (GFP+ or β-GAL+ cells) we examined, 78% of clusters were single-cell clones consisting of a neuron (NeuN+, Figure 4A), an astrocyte (GFAP+, Figure 4B), or a Sox2+ cell, and 10% of them were multicell clusters of homogeneous populations containing two Sox2+cells (SOX2+, Figure 4C) or two neurons (NeuN+, Figure 4D) (Table 2). Since a retrovirus only transduces one of the two daughter cells of dividing cells, single-cell clones are generated by the conversion of Sox2+ cells to downstream lineage.Table 2Lineage Relationship between Sox2+ NSCs and Other Neural Cell Types Derived from Sox2+ NSCsN OnlyA OnlyS OnlyS + NN + ANDNumber of Clusters269 (1)5 (1)9 (1)15129Number of Cells in Cluster32 (2)2 (2)1 (2)30171015129Lineage was traced 3 weeks after retrovirus was injected into the dentate gyri.

A, astrocyte; N, neuron; S, Sox2+ NSC; ND, not determined. We were also able to identify some clusters containing mixed cell populations that were informative to examine the multipotency of Sox2+ cells at a single-cell level. Fifteen clusters had a Sox2+ and a NeuN+ cell that were tightly associated with each other, suggesting that a single Sox2+ cell is capable of giving rise to one NSC and one differentiated neuron (Figure 4F, Figure S4). We also found one cluster that consisted of one NeuN+ and one GFAP+ (but SOX2−) cell, which supports the existence of Sox2+ NSCs that can give rise to both neurons and astrocytes (Figure 4E). Interestingly, one cluster contained a neuron (NeuN+) and a Sox2+ cell that also expressed GFAP in the radial process (Figure 4G, Figure S4). These results clearly show that nonradial Sox2+ cells not only have the potential to produce differentiated neural lineages (multipotent) but also are capable of giving rise to both radial and nonradial Sox2+ cells (self-renewal) at a single-cell level, providing the evidence that Sox2+ cells are indeed the self-renewing and multipotent NSCs in the SGZ. Mice with voluntary access to running wheels exhibited increased proliferation, subsequently leading to increased neurogenesis (van Praag et al., 1999van Praag H. Kempermann G. Gage F.H. Running increases cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult mouse dentate gyrus.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (2975) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear which cell type(s) was (were) proliferating and/or giving rise to the new neurons. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that proliferation of Sox2+ NSCs is responsible for the increased neurogenesis in running mice (Figure 5A). Consistent with previous results (van Praag et al., 1999van Praag H. Kempermann G. Gage F.H. Running increases cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult mouse dentate gyrus.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (2975) Google Scholar), the number of BrdU-positive cells increased in running mice (Figures 5B and 5C). While a few Sox2-GFP cells were labeled with BrdU in nonrunning mice, a much greater proportion of Sox2-GFP cells showed colocalization with BrdU in running mice (Figure 5E). Interestingly, however, the total number of Sox2-GFP cells did not change (Figures 5B and 5D, p = 0.1724, n = 7, unpaired Student's t test), even after the significant increase of BrdU-positive Sox2-GFP cells (Figure 5E, GFP/BrdU double). Since both dividing cells and their progeny can be labeled with BrdU in this accumulative injection paradigm, we used the cycling cell marker Ki67 to examine whether acutely dividing Sox2-GFP cell population also increased in running mice. The total number of the Ki67-positive dividing cell population increased (Figures 5B and 5C), concomitant with an increase in actively proliferating Sox2-GFP cells (Figure 5F, GFP/Ki67 double) in the running mice. Maintenance of a constant number of Sox2-GFP cells should be achieved by a mechanism that can account for increased neurogenesis in running mice. DCX has been shown to serve as a marker for neuronal precursors, and the number of DCX+ cells is positively correlated with the level of adult neurogenesis (Couillard-Despres et al., 2005Couillard-Despres S. Winner B. Schaubeck S. Aigner R. Vroemen M. Weidner N. Bogdahn U. Winkler J. Kuhn H.G. Aigner L. Doublecortin expression levels in adult brain reflect neurogenesis.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The number of DCX+ (Figures 5B and 5D) and DCX/BrdU double-positive cells (Figure 5E) increased significantly in runners, indicating that an increased number of DCX+ precursors was generated through the cell division in running mice. These observations collectively demonstrate that increased cycling of Sox2+ NSCs is associated with the production of new Sox2+ cells and the generation of committed neurons in running mice. Between the two morphologically different Sox2-GFP populations, the nonradial cells accounted for the proliferation of Sox2-GFP cells in nonrunning mi"

Here we show that the long-term (LT)-HSCs expressing the thrombopoietin (THPO) receptor, MPL, are a quiescent population in adult bone marrow (BM) and are closely associated with THPO-producing osteoblastic cells. THPO/MPL signaling upregulated β1-integrin and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in HSCs. Furthermore, inhibition and stimulation of THPO/MPL pathway by treatments with anti-MPL neutralizing antibody, AMM2, and with THPO showed reciprocal regulation of quiescence of LT-HSC. AMM2 treatment reduced the number of quiescent LT-HSCs and allowed exogenous HSC engraftment without irradiation. By contrast, exogenous THPO transiently increased quiescent HSC population and subsequently induced HSC proliferation in vivo. Altogether, these observations suggest that THPO/MPL signaling plays a critical role of LT-HSC regulation in the osteoblastic niche.

Altogether, these observations suggest that THPO/MPL signaling plays a critical role of LT-HSC regulation in the osteoblastic niche. HSCs self-renew and differentiate to produce multilineage blood cells throughout an individual's lifetime. Maintenance of such stem cell activities requires both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. For HSCs, these factors are provided by the microenvironment called the stem cell niche. Cell-cell, cell-extracellular matrix, and receptor-ligand interactions occur between HSCs and the niche (Li and Xie, 2005Li L. Xie T. Stem cell niche: structure and function.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 605-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, Adams and Scadden, 2006Adams G.B. Scadden D.T. The hematopoietic stem cell in its place.Nat.

Immunol. 2006; 6: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Such interaction of HSCs with the niche is critical to maintaining the balance between proliferation and quiescence, which is a common stem cell property with respect to the cell cycle. Cell-cycle quiescence is essential for long-term preservation of stem cell properties, including self-renewal capacity and the ability to differentiate into multiple lineages (Cheng et al., 2000Cheng T. Rodrigues N. Shen H. Yang Y. Dombkowski D. Sykes M. Scadden D.T. Hematopoietic stem cell quiescence maintained by p21cip1/waf1.Science. 2000; 287: 1804-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). We recently clarified a molecular mechanism whereby the cell cycle of HSCs is regulated by the osteoblastic niche in BM (Arai et al., 2004Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K. Koh G.Y. Suda T. Tie2/Angiopoietin-1 signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Cell-cycle regulation by the niche is critical for HSC fate. We previously reported that LIN−SCA1hiKIThi (LSK) cells in peripheral blood and spleen mobilized by G-CSF were not in the side population (SP) (Arai et al., 2004Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K. Koh G.Y. Suda T. Tie2/Angiopoietin-1 signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar), indicating that HSCs exited from the BM niche are not in G0. We found that quiescent HSCs adhere to osteoblastic cells in the BM niche and showed that interaction of the Tie2 receptor with its ligand angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) leads to tight adhesion of HSCs to the osteoblastic niche, resulting in maintenance of quiescence (Arai et al., 2004Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K. Koh G.Y. Suda T. Tie2/Angiopoietin-1 signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Currently, various molecules involved in the signaling and adhesive interaction between HSCs and the BM niche are identified (Yin and Li, 2006Yin T. Li L. The stem cell niches in bone.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that THPO/MPL signaling is a candidate niche factor. Signaling via THPO and its receptor, MPL, regulates megakaryogenesis (Kaushansky, 1995Kaushansky K. Thrombopoietin: the primary regulator of megakaryocyte and platelet production.Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 521-525PubMed Google Scholar). MPL was identified as the product of the c-MPL gene, the wild-type homolog of the oncogene v-MPL, the transforming gene of murine myeloproliferative leukemia virus (Vigon et al., 1992Vigon I. Mornon J.P. Cocault L. Mitjavila M.T. Tambourin P. Gisselbrecht S. Souyri M. Molecular cloning and characterization of mpl, the human homolog of the v-mpl oncogene: identification of a member of the hematopoietic growth factor receptor superfamily.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 5640-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). THPO acts as both a megakaryocyte colony-stimulating and maturation factor in megakaryopoiesis (de Sauvage et al., 1994de Sauvage F.J. Hass P.E. Spencer S.D. Malloy B.E. Gurney A.L. Spencer S.A.

In megakaryopoiesis, THPO/MPL interaction primarily stimulates late megakaryocytic colony-forming units, consequently increasing the number of mature megakaryocytes with the capacity to form proplatelets. Initially, THPO/MPL signaling was identified as the primary regulator of platelet production (Kaushansky, 1995Kaushansky K. Thrombopoietin: the primary regulator of megakaryocyte and platelet production.Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 521-525PubMed Google Scholar), and MPL later revealed its role closely related to HSC function (Kimura et al., 1998Kimura S. Roberts A.W. Metcalf D. Alexander W.S.

In addition, hyperresponsiveness to THPO seen in mice lacking the adaptor protein Lnk results in HSC expansion (Buza-Vidas et al., 2006Buza-Vidas N. Antonchuk J. Qian H. Mansson R. Luc S. Zandi S. Anderson K. Takaki S. Nygren J.M. Jensen C.T. et al.Cytokines regulate postnatal hematopoietic stem cell expansion: opposing roles of thrombopoietin and LNK.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2018-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Like other hematopoietic cytokines, THPO activates three major signaling pathways: p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Rojnuckarin et al., 1999Rojnuckarin P. Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Thrombopoietin-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in normal megakaryocytes: role in endomitosis.Blood. 1999; 94: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt (Geddis et al., 2001Geddis A.E. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is necessary but not sufficient for thrombopoietin-induced proliferation in engineered Mpl-bearing cell lines as well as in primary megakaryocytic progenitors.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34473-34479Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer, and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 and STAT5 (Dorsch et al., 1995Dorsch M. Fan P.D. Bogenberger J. Goff S.P. TPO and IL-3 induce overlapping but distinct protein tyrosine phosphorylation in a myeloid precursor cell line.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Although these signaling pathways have been broadly studied in the context of megakaryopoiesis, the role of THPO/MPL signaling in the interaction of quiescent HSCs with the niche is still unknown. Here we identified that LSKCD34−MPL+ cells and LSKCD34+MPL+ cells are regarded as quiescent and active HSCs, respectively. In addition, both LSKCD34−MPL+ and LSKCD34+MPL+ cells had the ability for long-term BM reconstitution (LTR). Further, we found that quiescent MPL+ HSCs adhered to THPO-producing osteoblastic cells on the endosteal surface. Such positional association between MPL+ HSC and THPO+ osteoblastic cells suggests that THPO/MPL signaling contributes to regulation of quiescent LT-HSCs in the osteoblastic niche. We also investigated the physiological role of THPO/MPL signaling in regulating HSCs in the niche using an anti-MPL neutralizing antibody (Ab) and recombinant THPO. Inhibition of the THPO/MPL pathway with a neutralizing anti-MPL Ab reduced the number of quiescent HSCs and HSC-niche interaction. On the other hand, exogenous THPO transiently increased the proportion of quiescent HSCs in vivo. These observations indicate that THPO and MPL in HSCs play a role in the maintenance of quiescence of HSCs in the niche. Although MPL expression in HSCs has been demonstrated (Berardi et al., 1995Berardi A.C. Wang A. Levine J.D. Lopez P. Scadden D.T.

To analyze that function, we examined first the MPL expression in subsets of LSK cells. It has been shown that LT-HSCs are enriched in the CD34−FLT3−Tie2+ or CD48−CD150+ fractions in LSK cells (Osawa et al., 1996Osawa M. Hanada K. Hamada H. Nakauchi H.

Therefore, we analyzed the proportion of MPL+ cells in LT-HSCs (Figure 1A). MPL+Tie2+ cells were enriched in LSKCD34−FLT3− cells. In LSKCD48− cells, MPL+ cells were divided into CD150+ and CD150− cells. The percentages of MPL+ cells in LSKCD34−FLT3−Tie2+ and LSKCD48−CD150+ cells were 96.4% ± 1.7% and 97.2% ± 3.6%, respectively, suggesting that MPL is expressed in LT-HSCs and may play a role in LTR activity. Next, we analyzed the expression of MPL in SP cells in LSK. SP and non-SP phenotypes in LSK cells represent quiescent and cycling HSCs, respectively (Arai et al., 2004Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K. Koh G.Y. Suda T. Tie2/Angiopoietin-1 signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). FACS analysis showed that 85.6% ± 2.3% of LSK-SP cells express MPL (Figure 1B). To investigate the potential relevance of MPL expression to HSC cell-cycle status, we analyzed the proportion of LSK-MPL+ cells after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced myelosuppression (Figure 1C). After 2 days of 5-FU treatment, the remaining LSK cells were MPL positive (82.1% ± 6.1% of LSK cells), whereas LSK-MPL− cells were susceptible to 5-FU treatment, which are similar findings to the case of LSK-SP cells, as previously reported (Arai et al., 2004Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K. Koh G.Y. Suda T. Tie2/Angiopoietin-1 signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). After 6 days of 5-FU treatment, the proportion of LSK-SP cells was reduced, and the population of LSK cells shifted from SP to non-SP. Similar to the change of SP, MPL expression was downregulated (44.6% ± 5.1%) after 6 days of 5-FU treatment. Next, to clarify the changes of cell-cycle regulators, we examined the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (Cdkns), c-Myc, and Tie2 in LSKCD34+ or−MPL+ or− cells. As shown in Figure 1D, p57Kip2 (Cdkn1c) was markedly expressed in CD34−MPL+ fraction in LSK, and Tie2 was expressed in MPL+ fraction in LSK regardless of CD34 expression. In addition, p57Kip2 was highly expressed in LSK-SP cells (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Altogether, these data suggest that MPL is expressed in the quiescent LT-HSCs in adult BM. We previously reported that Tie2 is a marker for LT-HSCs and that 5-FU-resistant Tie2+ cells are quiescent HSCs in the osteoblastic niche (Arai et al., 2004Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K. Koh G.Y. Suda T. Tie2/Angiopoietin-1 signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined expressions of MPL in 5-FU-treated BM to define the localization of MPL+ HSCs along with Tie2 in BM (Figure 2A). 5-FU-resistant Tie2+MPL+ cells were localized to the endosteal surface, where osteoblasts reside, suggesting that MPL+HSCs are localized in the osteoblastic niche. To further confirm whether 5-FU-resistant MPL+ cells are in quiescence, we performed BrdU long-term label-retaining (BrdU-LTR) cell assay. BrdU-LTR is a marker for identification of quiescent cells in tissue (Zhang et al., 2003Zhang J. Niu C. Ye L. Huang H. He X. Tong W.G. Ross J. Haug J. Johnson T. Feng J.Q. et al.Identification of the haematopoietic stem cell niche and control of the niche size.Nature. 2003; 425: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (2283) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2B, BrdU-LTR cells expressed MPL and adhered to bone-lining cells in 5-FU-treated BM. These data suggest that 5-FU-resistant MPL+ HSCs are quiescent HSCs in the osteoblastic niche. Osteoblastic cells are the key component of the HSC niche, and quiescent HSCs specifically localize to the endosteal surface of adult BM (Nilsson et al., 2001Nilsson S.K. Johnston H.M. Coverdale J.A.

Therefore, we analyzed THPO expression in BM. Immunohistochemical staining of THPO in BM showed that a subset of bone-lining alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-positive osteoblastic cells express THPO (Figure 2C), suggesting that THPO is produced in the microenvironment of osteoblastic niche cells. In addition, 5-FU-resistant MPL+ cells adhered to the THPO-producing osteoblastic cells on the bone surface (Figure 2D). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed that THPO was expressed in the BM-derived osteoblastic cell clones (Figure 2E). These data suggest that THPO/MPL signaling between osteoblastic cells and HSCs is involved in the niche regulation of HSCs, and the cell adhesion of MPL+ HSCs to THPO+ osteoblastic cells might contribute to the maintenance of quiescent HSCs in the osteoblastic niche. Since MPL expression in a subset of LSK cells corresponded to the known LT-HSC population, we hypothesized that THPO/MPL signaling was physiologically involved in the HSC function. Then we examined whether expression of MPL in HSCs contributes to LTR activity. First we compared BM reconstitution capacity between MPL+ and MPL− fraction in LSK cells. As shown in Figure 3A, the cells that have LTR activity were enriched in MPL+ fraction in LSK fraction. In addition, MPL+ cells showed remarkable repopulation after the second BM transplantation (BMT) (Figure 3B). For further evaluation of the role of MPL in LT-HSC and ST-HSC population, we subdivided LSK cells into four fractions (CD34−MPL+, CD34+MPL+, CD34−MPL−, and CD34+MPL−) and examined LTR activity (Figure 3C). It has been reported that LT-HSCs were enriched in CD34− fraction in LSK cells (Osawa et al., 1996Osawa M. Hanada K. Hamada H. Nakauchi H. Long-term lymphohematopoietic reconstitution by a single CD34-low/negative hematopoietic stem cell.Science. 1996; 273: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). We found that MPL+ fraction had significantly higher LTR activity than MPL− fraction in LSKCD34− cells (Figure 3C). Peripheral blood analyses showed that the donor-derived LSKCD34−MPL+ cells differentiated into myeloid, B cell, and T cell lineages (Figure 3D). These data suggest that LT-HSC was predominantly enriched in LSKCD34−MPL+ cells. Unexpectedly, MPL+ cells in LSKCD34+ cells, which were thought short-term (ST)-HSCs, clearly showed lymphomyeloid reconstitution (Figures 3C and 3D), even though the peripheral blood chimerism was lower than LSKCD34−MPL+ cells. These data indicate that MPL is an effective marker for LT-HSCs. This result can contribute to establishment of a novel cell purification strategy of LT-HSCs, with which higher purity is achievable than with currently available protocol. To investigate the function of THPO/MPL signaling in HSC maintenance in vitro, we performed long-term colony-initiating cell (LTC-ICs) assays and cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFCs) assays with or without the anti-MPL neutralizing Ab, AMM2. AMM2 did not inhibit colony formation of freshly isolated LSK cells (Figure 4A), while AMM2 inhibited the maintenance of LTC-IC on OP9 stromal cells (Figure 4B). These data suggest that THPO/MPL signaling maintains immature HSC phenotypes in vitro. We analyzed the function of THPO/MPL signaling in HSC cobblestone formation. To do so, we cocultured LSK-MPL+ cells and OP9 stromal cells in the presence of THPO or AMM2 and evaluated CAFCs. As shown in Figure 4C, exogenous THPO enhanced cobblestone formation 3-fold in LSK-MPL+ cells compared to stem cell factor (SCF) alone. By contrast, AMM2 inhibited adhesion of LSK-MPL+ cells and reduced CAFCs in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, THPO upregulated β1-integrin expression in LSK-MPL+ cells compared to SCF alone (Figure 4D). It has been shown that THPO activated β1-integrin in a human progenitor cell line and CD34+CD38− cells (Cui et al., 1997Cui L. Ramsfjell V. Borge O.J. Veiby O.P. Lok S. Jacobsen S.E. Thrombopoietin promotes adhesion of primitive human hemopoietic cells to fibronectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1: role of activation of very late antigen (VLA)-4 and VLA-5.J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, these data suggest that THPO/MPL signaling preserves immature phenotypes in HSCs via interaction with stromal cells. Next, we examined the effects of THPO/MPL signaling on the expression of cell-cycle regulators. First, we examined effects of administration of AMM2 or THPO in vivo on expression of Cdkns (p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2), c-Myc, and Tie2 in LSK cells. AMM2 and THPO treatment revealed a reciprocal correlation with expression of p57kip2 (increased by THPO, decreased by AMM2), c-Myc (decreased by THPO, increased by AMM2), and Tie2 (increased by THPO, decreased by AMM2) (Figure 5A). In addition, p21Cip1 expression was slightly upregulated by THPO. Next, we examined the effects of THPO treatment on LSKCD34−MPL+ and LSKCD34+MPL+ cells in vitro and found that THPO maintained the expression levels of p57Kip2, c-Myc, and Tie2 in LSKCD34−MPL+ cells (Figure 5B). Although THPO treatment upregulated p57Kip2 and Tie2 in LSKCD34+MPL+ cells, the stimulation of THPO/MPL signaling did not enhance LTR activity of LSKCD34+MPL+ cells after 2 days of cultivation (data not shown). We speculate that self-renewal capacity and the efficient LTR activity might be enhanced, provided the adequate cell-adhesion molecules and interaction with extracellular matrix had existed in culture condition. If so, optimization of culture condition including artificial extracellular matrix and other niche factors must be necessary to reproduce niche environment in vitro that maximizes the intrinsic capability of HSCs. Combinational treatment of SCF with THPO suppressed p57Kip2 and Tie2 in LSKCD34−MPL+ cells, while THPO suppressed SCF-induced upregulation of c-Myc. These data suggest that THPO/MPL signaling is associated with the regulation of cell-cycle-regulator expression in LT-HSCs. We hypothesized from these findings that THPO/MPL signaling is involved in the maintenance of quiescence of LT-HSCs. In order to examine the role of THPO/MPL signaling in the maintenance of quiescent HSC, we treated mice with AMM2 and analyzed the cell-cycle status of LT-HSCs. This treatment slightly decreased the platelet counts on day 6 (Figure S2) but did not induce apoptosis of LSK cells (data not shown). It was previously reported that pyronin Y (PY)low/− and PY+ cells were in G0 and G1 phases of cell cycle, respectively (Hüttmann et al., 2001Hüttmann A. Liu S.L. Boyd A.W. Li C.L. Functional heterogeneity within rhodamine123(lo) Hoechst33342(lo/sp) primitive hemopoietic stem cells revealed by pyronin Y.Exp. Hematol. 2001; 29: 1109-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Then, we investigated the effect of AMM2 treatment on the cell-cycle status of LT-HSCs by PY staining. Consistent with previous reports (Yamazaki et al., 2006Yamazaki S. Iwama A. Takayanagi S. Morita Y. Eto K. Ema H. Nakauchi H. Cytokine signals modulated via lipid rafts mimic niche signals and induce hibernation in hematopoietic stem cells.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), most LSKCD34− cells are PYlow/−, suggesting that these cells are in the G0 phase of the cell cycle in the steady state. On day 6 of AMM2 injection, AMM2 treatment dose-dependently increased the PY+ fraction in LSKCD34− cells (Figures 6A and 6B). These data suggest that the inhibition of THPO/MPL signaling results in reduction of the quiescent HSC population. In addition, the proportion of SP cells in LSK cells was reduced concomitantly with the increase of PY+ cells after 6 days of AMM2 injection (Figure 6C, Figure S3). In contrast to the AMM2, the inhibition of SCF/c-Kit signaling by anti-c-Kit neutralizing Ab, ACK2, did not affect PY− population in LSKCD34− cells but reduced PY+ fraction in LSKCD34+ cells (Figure S4). In addition, ACK2 treatment reduced non-SP in LSK cells on day 3 (Figure S4). From these data above, we hypothesized that blocking THPO/MPL signals influence not only the cell cycle but also HSC-niche interactions. To clarify this issue, we examined whether AMM2 administration enables HSCs to engraft under nonmyeloablative conditions (Figures 6D and 6E). Since it is likely that a transition of the cell population from non-SP to SP cells would disturb engraftment of the donor HSCs, we administered a low dose of 5-FU to deplete the endogenous cycling HSCs. As shown in Figure 6E, only combined adminis"
https://openalex.org/W2075234503,"Developmental abnormalities, cancer, and premature aging each have been linked to defects in the DNA damage response (DDR). Mutations in the ATR checkpoint regulator cause developmental defects in mice (pregastrulation lethality) and humans (Seckel syndrome). Here we show that eliminating ATR in adult mice leads to defects in tissue homeostasis and the rapid appearance of age-related phenotypes, such as hair graying, alopecia, kyphosis, osteoporosis, thymic involution, fibrosis, and other abnormalities. Histological and genetic analyses indicate that ATR deletion causes acute cellular loss in tissues in which continuous cell proliferation is required for maintenance. Importantly, thymic involution, alopecia, and hair graying in ATR knockout mice were associated with dramatic reductions in tissue-specific stem and progenitor cells and exhaustion of tissue renewal and homeostatic capacity. In aggregate, these studies suggest that reduced regenerative capacity in adults via deletion of a developmentally essential DDR gene is sufficient to cause the premature appearance of age-related phenotypes."

During development from a single cell to a complex organism, mammals establish a progressively increasing number of distinct cell types with progressively decreasing developmental potential. In the adult, the identities of distinct cell types are generally stable, implying that the underlying transcriptional networks that help impart those identities must be stable, in spite of the ability of some genes to respond rapidly to physiological and environmental stimuli. However, the cloning of Dolly demonstrated that, under some conditions, those transcriptional networks could be altered to impart a dramatic change in identity. It is a central goal of regenerative medicine to understand how cellular identity is maintained and how that identity might be changed to mediate the repair of damaged tissue. Human embryonic stem (ES) cells offer an important model for examining transitions of cellular identity in human material (Thomson et al., 1998Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S.

Unlike somatic cells, ES cells have the potential to differentiate into any cell type of the body, a potential that remains poorly understood. It has been suggested that this potential is related to an unusual chromatin structure or to specific histone modifications (Azuara et al., 2006Azuara V. Perry P. Sauer S. Spivakov M. Jorgensen H.F.

USA. 2005; 102: 8603-8608Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The recent mapping of both H3K4me3- and H3K27me3-modified regions across highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mouse ES cells revealed an unexpectedly high frequency of colocalization of these “activating” and “repressive” modifications (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein B.E. Mikkelsen T.S. Xie X. Kamal M. Huebert D.J. Cuff J. Fry B. Meissner A. Wernig M. Plath K. et al.A bivalent chromatin structure marks key developmental genes in embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2006; 125: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3739) Google Scholar). These “bivalent” modifications were proposed to represent genes specially poised to initiate transcription, and this poised state was proposed to be central to the developmental potential of ES cells. To gain further insight into the whole-genome distribution of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, we mapped these modifications across the entire genome in human ES cells. Our results confirm that Polycomb-mediated H3K27me3 is associated with widespread suppression of developmental genes, and we extend previous findings in showing that colocalization of H3K27me3 with H3K4me3 at promoters in human ES cells is the rule rather than the exception. We also found that genes initially marked with both H3K4 and H3K27 modifications could indeed change rapidly with differentiation; however, many genes that lack this particular combination of marks were capable of rapid change as well. In addition, transcription factors involved in pluripotency—OCT4 (POU5F1), NANOG, SOX2—that were initially marked only by H3K4me3 became marked with H3K27me3 as well with the onset of transcriptional suppression of these genes during differentiation. Our finding that pluripotency-associated transcription factors become modified by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 as they are downregulated during differentiation demonstrates that not all potential Polycomb targets relevant to developmental regulation are suppressed in ES cells and that the recruitment of the Polycomb complexes changes rapidly during early differentiation, both to relieve existing and create new repressive domains. We also find a substantial class of genes initially marked by neither H3K4me3 nor H3K27me3, which is poorly expressed but highly enriched for genes that can respond to physiological stimuli, suggesting fundamental differences in the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that control genes that can respond to transient signals and those that specify or maintain cell identity. By using specific antibodies, we immunoprecipitated H3K4me3- or H3K27me3-associated genomic DNA (chromatin immunoprecipitation, ChIP) from H1 human ES cells maintained in defined medium (TeSR medium), (Figure 1A and see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online) (Ludwig et al., 2006aLudwig T.E.

Antibody-enriched DNA was then sonicated (resulting in fragments between 250 and 500 bp in size), amplified, labeled, and mixed with equal amounts of differentially labeled input DNA and hybridized to microarrays containing roughly 14.5 million 50-mer oligonucleotides, representing all the nonrepeat DNA across the human genome at a 100 bp resolution (Figures 1A and 1B) (Kim et al., 2005Kim T.H.

We defined the H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 peaks using a simple algorithm that requires a stretch of at least three of four neighboring probes to have signals significantly above the background. A p value for each peak was calculated using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (see the Experimental Procedures and the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for more information). A threshold of p ≤ 0.078 was chosen for enriched H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 modification regions, which represents a false discovery rate (FDR) of ∼8% based on the stepwise p value method proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995Benjamini Y.

A total of 14,106 H3K27me3 peaks were identified, with a size range of 250–42,630 bp. Of these peaks, 75% are larger than 628 bp with a median of 1050 bp. The combined length of all H3K27me3 peaks (22,700,677 bp) represents 0.75% of the genome (Figure 2A). For H3K4me3, 23,115 peaks were detected with a size range of 250–29,060 bp. Of these peaks, 75% are larger than 850 bp with a median of 1604 bp. The total length of the H3K4me3 peaks (43,223,975 bp) represents 1.4% of the genome (Figure 2A).Figure 2Whole-Genome Distributions of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in Human ES CellsShow full caption(A) Total H3K4- or H3K27-modified regions in human ES cells.(B) Distributions of H3K4 or H3K27 peaks relative to the TSS of RefSeq annotations.

(C) Histone peak patterns of the total UCSC known genes. In order to match these peaks to genes, we first examined the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 peak distribution near the TSS (±5 kb) of all 23,302 well-annotated RefSeq genes. We found that H3K4me3 peaks were enriched in the region closest to the TSS sites (±2 kb) (Figure 2B), consistent with previous results (Liu et al., 2005Liu C.L. Kaplan T. Kim M. Buratowski S. Schreiber S.L. Friedman N. Rando O.J. Single-nucleosome mapping of histone modifications in S. cerevisiae.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e328https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0030328Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). H3K27me3 peaks were also enriched in a band centered around the TSS, but with a greater width and with central depressed signal intensity immediately over the TSS site, suggesting at least partial exclusion of this modification at the TSS (Figure 2B). This partial exclusion could be related to H3K4me3 occupancy or the presence of a preinitiation complex. Using a region extending 2.5 kb in each direction from the 5′ end of genes, 57% of H3K27 and 73% of H3K4 trimethylation peaks corresponded to known or predicted 5′ ends. When the peaks were randomized across the genome, only 5.8% of H3K27 and 5.7% of H3K4 trimethylation peaks corresponded to known or predicted gene 5′ ends (±2.5 kb). H3K4 and/or H3K27 trimethylation marked 67% of all the UCSC known genes (Figure 2C). Notably, a majority (65%) of the UCSC known genes were marked with H3K4me3 (alone or in combination with H3K27me3), and only a small number of the UCSC genes (2%) were marked with H3K27me3 alone. We found a substantial portion of the UCSC genes (16%) that is associated with both modifications in human ES cells and a third (33%) that is not associated with either modification (Tables S1–S4). We also compared the genomic positions of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 peak regions with enhancers and CpG islands (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). H3K4/H3K27 peak regions are considered to be overlapping with enhancers or CpG islands if they overlap or if the distance between them is less than 50 bp. Of 23,115 H3K4me3 peak regions, 1022 overlap with enhancers and 13,252 overlap with CpG islands. Of these 1022 H3K4me3 regions that overlap with enhancers, 795 also overlap with CpG islands. Of 14,106 H3K27me3 peak regions, 302 overlap with enhancers and 1900 overlap with CpG islands. Of these 302 H3K27me3 regions that overlap with enhancers, 116 also overlap with CpG islands. For H3K4me3 peaks that are at least 2 kb away from the nearest TSS and are associated with enhancers, 93.4% overlap with CpG islands. For H3K27me3 peaks that are at least 2 kb away from the nearest TSS and are associated with enhancers, 70.6% overlap with CpG islands. Previous analysis in other model systems and a smaller-scale study using human cells suggested that H3K4me3 associates with active promoters, while H3K27me3 associates with silenced promoters (Santos-Rosa et al., 2002Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T.

To examine the relationships of promoter status to the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 patterns in human ES cells, we compared expression levels of genes associated with different H3K4me3 and/or H3K27me3 modification patterns. Based on the gene expression microarray data of human ES cells, we found that genes associated with just H3K4me3 had the highest level of expression, while those with H3K27me3 alone had the lowest (Figure 3A), consistent with the previous findings. Genes with both histone modifications had relatively low levels of expression that were generally intermediate between expression levels of genes with the single modifications. Interestingly, a substantial portion of genes that lacked both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 had a very low average expression level that was similar to those genes marked by H3K27me3 alone. Comparisons of the four categories of histone-marked genes (H3K4me3 only, H3K27me3 only, colocalized, and neither mark) with publicly available SAGE data for human ES cells from the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (CGAP) gave very similar results to the microarray-based comparisons (data not shown). In addition to analyzing the expression level of genes divided into four categories, we also plotted the average signal intensities for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 around the TSS for all known genes broken down into five distinct expression categories by decile (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 10th decile where 1st is lowest expressors and 10th is highest expressors) (Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3B, the lowest expressors tend to be H3K27me3 dominant or lack both modifications around the TSS (Figure 3B, leftmost panel). As the expression level increases, the average H3K4me3 signal increases, with a concomitant dip in H3K27me3 average signal at the TSS. This H3K27me3 dip actually extends below background for the highly expressed genes (Figure 3B, rightmost panel) and extends well into the gene, suggesting there is a low level of H3K27me3 modifications throughout the genome that is actively removed at the TSS and within genes as genes are expressed. Previous studies on HCNEs in mouse ES cells (2.5% of whole genome) revealed a fair number of genomic regions associated with both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein B.E. Mikkelsen T.S. Xie X. Kamal M. Huebert D.J. Cuff J. Fry B. Meissner A. Wernig M. Plath K. et al.A bivalent chromatin structure marks key developmental genes in embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2006; 125: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3739) Google Scholar). Through whole-genome analysis in human ES cells, we found that most H3K27me3 peaks (90%) localized on promoters that were already marked with H3K4me3, suggesting that colocalization of H3K27me3 with H3K4me3 on the same promoters is a rule in ES cells rather than an exception. A gene is considered to be colocalized if it contains both an H3K27me3 peak and an H3K4me3 peak within ±2.5 kb of its TSS. The vast majority (5659 out of 6060, 93%) of these colocalized genes have an H3K27me3 peak that overlaps at least 1 bp with the H3K4me3 peak. It is possible that the percentage of overlapping regions would be higher if repetitive regions that are masked out of the arrays could be probed. To further examine this colocalization, we plotted the signal intensities around the TSS for both of the modifications for genes in each of the four H3K4me3/H3K27me3 categories to examine whether the threshold used for our peak-finding algorithm produced false negatives that resulted in genes being assigned to incorrect categories (Figure 4A). In the case of the H3K27me3-only category (Figure 4A, second panel), there was an average enrichment for H3K4me3 centered around the TSS that was higher than background, suggesting that at least some genes in this category were misassigned, as some appear to have modest H3K4me3 enrichment that falls below the threshold of our peak finder. In contrast, the gene category lacking both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 peaks demonstrated no signal enrichment around the TSS for either modification (Figure 4A, right panel), further increasing our confidence that the “neither” category is real. Genes closely associated with pluripotency, such as NANOG, POU5F1 (OCT4), and SOX2, and housekeeping genes, such as GAPDH, were marked solely by H3K4me3 (Figure 1C and Figure S2). Many known developmental control genes, such as SOX1, PAX6 (neural ectoderm); T, HAND1 (mesoderm); GATA4, GATA6 (endoderm); and GATA2, GATA3, CDX2 (trophectoderm) were associated with both modifications (Figure 1C and Figure S2). Through ChIP-combined QPCR, we confirmed the H3K4me3-only patterns on the promoters of pluripotent genes NANOG, POU5F1, and SOX2 and housekeeping gene GAPDH and colocalization of both markers on the promoters of developmental genes (Figure 4B). To exclude the possibility that this colocalization might be due to mixed-cell populations, we performed sequential ChIP first to H3K27me3 then to H3K4me3 (Figure 4C) on the same sample. Compared with genes solely modified by H3K4me3, each developmental gene again showed significant enrichments of H3K27me3 modifications on their promoters (Figure 4C). To gain insight into biological functions of genes associated with different combinations of histone modifications, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis of the genes in each of the four categories. We found that significant enrichments for genes associated with both modifications were related to developmental functions (Figure 5). Many known critical transcription factors were identified from this gene set. In all, we identified 587 factors with combined H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation that are involved in transcriptional regulation, including key regulators of early development such as HOX factors, GATA factors, forkhead factors, and homeodomain factors (Table S5). Many of these factors were previously identified to be targets of the Polycomb complex both in human and mouse ES cells (Boyer et al., 2006Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I. Levine S.S. Wernig M. Tajonar A.

Isono K. et al.Control of developmental regulators by Polycomb in human embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2006; 125: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar), indicating that, in ES cells, the Polycomb complex-based modifications correlate with genes modified by H3K4me3. In contrast to the H3K4/H3K27me3-overlapping genes, genes that carried neither H3K4 nor H3K27 trimethylation were not enriched in developmental function but in functions related to signal transduction and physiological response to stimuli (Figure 5). These genes were expressed at low levels in ES cells. For example, rhodopsin-like G protein receptor (GPCR) superfamily members, olfactory receptors, and immune-response factors were highly enriched in this category (Table S6). The genes with only the H3K4 modification were strongly associated with basic physiologic processes common to all cells, probably reflecting the fact that a large number of expressed housekeeping genes fall into this category. Also, in addition to transcription factors related to ES pluripotency, genes in signaling pathways active in human ES cells, such as in the FGF-MAP kinase pathway, were generally marked by H3K4me3 alone (Figure S3). Thus, H3K4me3 marks a set of genes that maintain fundamental properties of human ES cells. GO terms for the genes marked solely with H3K27me3 had enrichment with p values of much lower significance (data not shown), possibly reflecting the small size of this category but also decreasing our confidence that this represents a real category. Previous studies in mouse ES cells proposed that H3K4me3/H3K27me3 overlapping on the same promoter (bivalent) kept the target gene in a poised state for later activation upon ES cell differentiation (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein B.E. Mikkelsen T.S. Xie X. Kamal M. Huebert D.J. Cuff J. Fry B. Meissner A. Wernig M. Plath K. et al.A bivalent chromatin structure marks key developmental genes in embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2006; 125: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3739) Google Scholar). To examine the relationship between specific histone modifications and developmental timing of gene expression, we monitored gene expression changes of H1 human ES cells during retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation and correlated those changes with initial H3K4/H3K27 trimethylation status. By 5 days of RA treatment, H1 ES cells changed morphology and downregulated OCT4 (Figure S1). During a 5 day time course of RA differentiation, 11.9% of H3K4-only genes, 19.5% of H3K4/H3K27-overlapping genes, 16.5% of H3K27-only genes, and 8.7% of genes marked with neither modification showed at least a 3-fold change for one or more time points examined (Figure 6 and Table S7). For the genes that altered expression, genes modified solely by H3K4me3 tended to be downregulated, perhaps not surprisingly, as this gene set contained many pluripotency-associated genes that were expressed at high levels initially. However, a significant number of H3K4me3-only genes were nonetheless upregulated. In contrast, most genes that changed expression and initially were associated with combined H3K4/H3K27 trimethylation or H3K27me3 alone were upregulated during differ"

Hematopoiesis represents a prototype system for the study of selection, establishment, and restriction of individual developmental programs from one common precursor (Bryder et al., 2006Bryder D. Rossi D.J. Weissman I.L. Hematopoietic stem cells: the paradigmatic tissue-specific stem cell.Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 338-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In this system, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the capacity to both self-propagate as well as differentiate into all blood cell lineages. Hematopoietic differentiation is a multistep process involving first the choice of HSC self-renewal versus differentiation, followed by commitment to different lineage fates. To be able to cope with the constant and varying challenges to the blood system, a considerable flexibility needs to accompany these events. Because HSCs themselves only rarely divide (Bradford et al., 1997Bradford G.B. Williams B. Rossi R. Bertoncello I. Quiescence, cycling, and turnover in the primitive hematopoietic stem cell compartment.Exp. Hematol. 1997; 25: 445-453PubMed Google Scholar, Cheshier et al., 1999Cheshier S.H. Morrison S.J. Liao X.

USA. 1999; 96: 3120-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) and are limited in numbers, it appears that the immature progeny of HSCs, which are more numerous and which harbor differential developmental and proliferative potentials, has been set up to cope with such altered demands and thereby serve to maintain a primary level of homeostatic control (Passegue et al., 2005Passegue E. Wagers A.J. Giuriato S. Anderson W.C. Weissman I.L. Global analysis of proliferation and cell cycle gene expression in the regulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell fates.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1599-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Differentiation of immature progenitors into distinct hematopoietic lineages is contingent on appropriate and timely execution of specific gene expression programs. These processes are under both intrinsic and extrinsic control, which jointly serve to propagate or repress individual genes (Laiosa et al., 2006Laiosa C.V. Stadtfeld M. Graf T. Determinants of lymphoid-myeloid lineage diversification.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 705-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A wide range of transcription factors are associated with lineage specificity, and the regulatory networks in which they operate are being elucidated (Blais and Dynlacht, 2005Blais A. Dynlacht B.D. Constructing transcriptional regulatory networks.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1499-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The critical requirement of appropriate control of such factors in oligopotent—but normally not self-renewing—progenitors has been highlighted by the development of leukemias arising as a consequence of the misappropriate expression of such transcriptional regulators (Cozzio et al., 2003Cozzio A. Passegue E. Ayton P.M. Karsunky H. Cleary M.L. Weissman I.L.

However, as such events are relatively rare, the processes governing their expression are presumably under tight regulatory control. Insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying lineage specification have to a large extent been provided from studies utilizing in vitro assays (Brady et al., 1995Brady G. Billia F.

Results obtained from such work are, however, limited from a physiologic point of view, emphasizing the importance of paralleling such studies with in vivo strategies. One approach toward this goal is to determine the cellular stages that accompany development into individual hematopoietic lineages in the steady-state in vivo situation, followed by dissection of the functional and molecular properties of such cells. Using such approaches, the purification of a common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) that produces lymphoid, but not myeloid, progeny (Kondo et al., 1997Kondo M. Weissman I.L. Akashi K. Identification of clonogenic common lymphoid progenitors in mouse bone marrow.Cell. 1997; 91: 661-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar) and a common myeloid progenitor (CMP) devoid of lymphoid but retaining full erythromyeloid competence (Akashi et al., 2000Akashi K.

This model has been a useful working model but is likely an oversimplification, as suggested foremost by the low clonal frequency of mixed myeloid colonies obtainable from candidate CMP (Akashi et al., 2000Akashi K.

Furthermore, Takano and colleagues provided evidence from in vitro paired daughter experiments of highly purified HSCs, where differentiation into individual myeloid lineages appeared to bypass a CMP intermediate (Takano et al., 2004Takano H. Ema H. Sudo K. Nakauchi H. Asymmetric division and lineage commitment at the level of hematopoietic stem cells: inference from differentiation in daughter cell and granddaughter cell pairs.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Moreover, Nutt and colleagues, using a transgenic knockin approach, separated candidate CMP based on differential expression levels of the transcription factor PU.1 and found that high-level expression of PU.1 in such cells was associated with granulocytic/macrophage offspring, whereas cells with low expression mainly produced megakaryocytic/erythroid progeny, with no evident hierarchical relationship in between those cells (Nutt et al., 2005Nutt S.L.

Consistent with this, the hematopoietic defects associated with PU.1 deficiency indicate a requirement of PU.1 for lymphoid and myeloid development while being dispensable for the generation of erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors (Scott et al., 1994Scott E.W.

Requirement of transcription factor PU.1 in the development of multiple hematopoietic lineages.Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Other studies have suggested that differentiation into the megakaryocytic/erythroid lineages may be an event upstream or in parallel to the generation of CMP (Adolfsson et al., 2005Adolfsson J.

Kondo M. Asymmetrical lymphoid and myeloid lineage commitment in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors.J. Exp.

Georgopoulos K. Early hematopoietic lineage restrictions directed by Ikaros.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 382-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Understanding the cellular and molecular events underlying and accompanying such processes has broad implications, including increased understanding of aberrant hematopoiesis—such as the emergence of different types of leukemias—and for the development of effective strategies aimed at guiding differentiation toward therapeutic benefit. Here, we demonstrate that differential cell-surface expression of signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (Slamf1/CD150), Endoglin (Eng/CD105), and Integrin alpha 2b (Itga2b/CD41) allows for the prospective identification of a range of myeloid progenitor subsets with developmentally restricted lineage potentials, including early lineage-restricted precursors for the granulocyte/macrophage, erythroid, and megakaryocytic lineages. Genome-wide expression analyses of these subsets revealed distinct and ordered expression profiles of multiple transcription factors and growth factor receptors known to be key regulators of myeloid commitment and function, thereby illuminating the cellular and molecular steps associated with definitive restriction into distinct myeloid fates. In the mouse, Endoglin and CD150 are two cell-surface molecules associated with high expression in the primitive HSC compartment (Chen et al., 2002Chen C.Z. Li M. de Graaf D. Monti S. Gottgens B. Sanchez M.J. Lander E.S. Golub T.R. Green A.R. Lodish H.F. Identification of endoglin as a functional marker that defines long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

SLAM family receptors distinguish hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and reveal endothelial niches for stem cells.Cell. 2005; 121: 1109-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). Because these proteins encode for cell-signaling receptors with a putative involvement in early HSC fate determination, we postulated that these markers might also exhibit differential expression patterns within other hematopoietic progenitor subsets. To test this, we first screened for the expression of CD150 and Endoglin by using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in a wide range of early hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The minor c-kit+Lin−Sca1+ (KLS) compartment can be resolved into functionally distinct subsets based on differential expression of CD34 and flk2 (Adolfsson et al., 2001Adolfsson J. Borge O.J. Bryder D. Theilgaard-Monch K. Astrand-Grundstrom I. Sitnicka E. Sasaki Y. Jacobsen S.E.

When analyzing the three subsets within the KLS fraction (LT-HSC, CD34−flk2−; ST-HSC, CD34+flk2−; and MPPflk2+, CD34+flk2+; Figure 1A), we found highest expression of both Endoglin and CD150 (Figures 1B and 1C) in LT-HSC. Endoglin expression levels in ST-HSC and MPPflk2+ were approximately half of that of LT-HSC, whereas CD150 expression was dramatically reduced in ST-HSC and undetectable in MPPflk2+ cells (Figures 1B and 1C). Within the CLP fraction expressing flk2 (CLPflk2+) (Kondo et al., 1997Kondo M. Weissman I.L. Akashi K. Identification of clonogenic common lymphoid progenitors in mouse bone marrow.Cell. 1997; 91: 661-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar; H. Karsunky, T. Serwold, D. Bhattacharya, M.A. Inlay, and I.L.W., unpublished data; Figure 1A), we detected low or undetectable expression levels of Endoglin and CD150, respectively (Figures 1B and 1C). Highly differential expression of these genes was observed in the originally described myeloerythroid progenitor fractions (Akashi et al., 2000Akashi K. Traver D. Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. A clonogenic common myeloid progenitor that gives rise to all myeloid lineages.Nature. 2000; 404: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). These fractions are jointly characterized by a c-kit+Lin−Sca1− (KLS−) phenotype and can be further separated based on expression of CD34 and FcgRII/III into common myeloid progenitors (CMP, CD34+FcgRlow), granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP, CD34+FcgRhigh), and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEP, CD34−FcgRlow) (Figure 1A). Endoglin was highly expressed within the MEP fraction and at lower levels in CMP and GMP, respectively (Figure 1B). A similar expression pattern was observed for CD150, although this gene was nearly undetectable in GMP (Figure 1C). Expression levels of Endoglin and CD150 were nearly undetectable in more mature granulocytes and Ter119+ erythroid cells (Figures 1B and 1C). Next, we phenotypically evaluated previously described myeloerythroid precursors for the cell-surface expression of CD150 and Endoglin. This analysis revealed that although GMP were uniformly low for both these markers, CMP could be subdivided into distinct CD150-negative and -positive populations, whereas MEP consisted of both CD150-positive and -negative cells as well as a large portion of cells expressing high levels of Endoglin (Figure 1D). The differential expression of CD150 and Endoglin in the myeloid progenitor compartment suggested that these markers might be used to subfractionate functionally distinct cell types. We therefore developed an isolation protocol that simultaneously assessed cell-surface expression of Endoglin, CD150, FcgRII/III, and CD41 in the KLS− compartment. We included CD41 in our fractionation protocol, as it has been reported that CD41-high cells within this compartment are committed to the megakaryocytic lineage (Nakorn et al., 2003Nakorn T.N. Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. Characterization of mouse clonogenic megakaryocyte progenitors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). By contrast, we decided to omit the use of CD34, as preliminary experiments had demonstrated that this marker did not add further functional resolution to our seven-color protocol (D.B., unpublished data). Six resolvable cell populations within the KLS− myeloid progenitor compartment could be identified (Figure 2). These individual populations showed evident morphological differences, suggesting that they might be functionally distinct (Figure 2), and will hereafter be referred to as Pre MegE, Pre CFU-E, CFU-E, MkP, Pre GM, and GMP based on the subsequent characterization work in these studies (see below). The myeloid progenitor subsets obtainable from the isolation protocol described in Figure 2 were next functionally evaluated at the clonal level by in vitro assays. First, we determined their plating efficiencies. With the exception of CFU-E, a high proportion of cells from all other subsets could be induced to proliferate in response to a combination of early acting cytokines, with plating efficiencies ranging from 45% to 75% (Figure 3A). Lineage potential of these cell subsets was evaluated by methylcellulose and agar cultures. In these assays, MkP was exclusively associated with megakaryocyte generation (Figure 3B) and thus appears functionally equivalent to the CD9-positive megakaryocyte-committed precursor described previously (Nakorn et al., 2003Nakorn T.N. Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. Characterization of mouse clonogenic megakaryocyte progenitors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, MkP cells were found to express high levels of CD9 mRNA (D.B., unpublished data), and CD9-positive MkPs were found to be CD150+, with very similar in vitro lineage potentials of these subsets (Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). The GMP described here produced primarily granulocytes and/or macrophage colonies (94%, Figure 3B) and are thus functionally equivalent to the previously described GMP (Akashi et al., 2000Akashi K. Traver D. Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. A clonogenic common myeloid progenitor that gives rise to all myeloid lineages.Nature. 2000; 404: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). Within the KLS−CD41lowFcgRlow/− compartment, Pre GM showed a remarkably similar clonal lineage output to the FcgR-positive GMP (82% granulocyte/macrophage clones), although rare megakaryocytic and/or erythroid elements were also consistently observed from this cell population (Figure 3B and C.J.H.P. and D.B., unpublished data). Single Pre MegE cells effectively produced megakaryocytic, erythroid as well as mixed megakaryocyte/erythroid colonies. In contrast, Pre CFU-Es gave rise almost exclusively to erythroid colonies of various sizes (Figure 3B). Stroma-supported cultures confirmed that granulocyte/macrophage potential of KLS−CD41lowFcgRlow/− cells was restricted to Pre GM (Figure 3D). Lineage potential of CFU-Es had to be determined in methylcellulose cultures due to their inability to proliferate in agar cultures (see below, Figure 6), but we noted that such cells could be induced to proliferate to some extent by using OP9 stroma-supported cultures (Figure 6). We next examined the potential of the more primitive cells upstream in the KLS compartment to see whether differential expression of CD150 within this compartment might also be predictive of lineage potential. KLSCD150+ cells, which contain all HSC activity (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H. Iwashita T. Yilmaz O.H. Terhorst C. Morrison S.J. SLAM family receptors distinguish hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and reveal endothelial niches for stem cells.Cell. 2005; 121: 1109-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar), were found to be associated with multiple colony types, including many blast colonies, supporting the notion that this fraction contains many immature cells that do not mature fully within the 7 day cell culture protocol employed here (Figure 3C). Of note was that this fraction also produced a high portion of clones containing exclusively megakaryocyte progeny (137 out of 400 cells evaluated, Figure 3C). By contrast, the KLSCD150− population, which contains multipotent progenitor but no stem cell activity (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H. Iwashita T. Yilmaz O.H. Terhorst C. Morrison S.J. SLAM family receptors distinguish hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and reveal endothelial niches for stem cells.Cell. 2005; 121: 1109-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar), essentially lacked megakaryocyte potential at a clonal level, with only 2 out of 400 cells evaluated yielding megakaryocytes (Figure 3C). These cells were nonetheless very efficient in producing granulocyte and/or macrophage progeny, which were observed in 88% of evaluated clones (Figure 3C). Taken together, these data establish that differential expression of CD150 and Endoglin of early myeloerythroid progenitors is associated with functional differences in their in vitro lineage potentials, a feature extended to a high degree also to the immature KLS compartment. We next evaluated the in vivo reconstituting activities of these cells. KLS−CD150+/− myeloid progenitors were sorted from mice where GFP expression is driven from a ubiquitously expressed β-actin promoter. Apart from marking donor white blood cells, this system also permits readout of mature platelets (Nakorn et al., 2003Nakorn T.N. Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. Characterization of mouse clonogenic megakaryocyte progenitors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Despite the high-clonal megakaryocyte capacity of CD150+ myeloid progenitors in vitro (Figure 2B), in vivo platelet reconstitution was found to be limited with such cells (Table 1). This was in striking contrast to that observed for the CD150+ HSC subset, which already showed rapid and robust platelet recovery 7–14 days after transplantation of as few as 75 cells (Table 1). Peak production of granulocytes was observed with CD150− myeloid progenitors 7 days after transplantation, a time point where CD150− myeloid progenitors reconstituted the granulocytic lineages to significantly higher degrees than observed for either of the control KLS subsets (Table 1). The failure to produce mature progeny in vivo beyond these early time points (Table 1) confirms the lack of self-renewal potential of these myeloid subsets.Table 1Capacity of Prospectively Isolated Myeloid Subsets to Generate Platelets and Granulocytes In VivoCell TypeNumber of Injected CellsLineage EvaluatedPercentage of Donor-Derived CellsDay 7Day 14Day 52No cells0Platelets000Granulocytes000Unfractionated BM1,500,000Platelets3.5 ± 1.539.5 ± 3.649 ± 2.7Granulocytes14.4 ± 10.178.5 ± 1.271.7 ± 6.2Myeloid progenitors, CD150−6,000Platelets0.15 ± 0.050.56 ± 0.720Granulocytes5.6 ± 4.67.3 ± 11.40Myeloid progenitors, CD150+1,500Platelets0.23 ± 0.040.07 ± 0.030Granulocytes0.1 ± 0.1800MPP, CD150−300Platelets0.3 ± 0.163.2 ± 1.60Granulocytes1.2 ± 0.0323.1 ± 10.30.14 ± 0.02HSC, CD150+75Platelets0.43 ± 0.2520.3 ± 2.742.2 ± 8.8Granulocytes0.1 ± 0.1814.8 ± 7.655.3 ± 10.9Sublethally irradiated recipients (450 rad) were transplanted with 1.5 × 106 GFP expressing whole BM cells or the indicated number of isolated stem and progenitor cells estimated to be contained within 1.5 × 106 unfractionated BM cells.

At days 7, 14, and 52 after transplantation, mouse PB was analyzed for the levels of donor platelets and granulocytes, respectively. n = 3 recipients receiving each cell type and show mean ± SD. To evaluate erythroid potential in vivo, we performed day 8 spleen colony forming assay (CFU-S8) (Na Nakorn et al., 2002Na Nakorn T. Traver D. Weissman I.L. Akashi K.

Invest. 2002; 109: 1579-1585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also analyzed reticulocyte recovery after transplantation. In contrast to transplantation of 200 Pre MegE cells, which generated large CFU-S8 at high frequency (∼1/10) (Figure 4A, right), transplantation of 200 Pre GMs gave rise to few CFU-S8 colonies (Figure 4A, left). We also transplanted lethally irradiated recipients with cells of each subset in order to gauge their in vivo erythroid potential, because rapid erythropoiesis is critical to circumvent the consequences of a lethal irradiation (Na Nakorn et al., 2002Na Nakorn T. Traver D. Weissman I.L. Akashi K. Myeloerythroid-restricted progenitors are sufficient to confer radioprotection and provide the majority of day 8 CFU-S.J. Clin.

We observed substantial mortality at 12 days after transplantation; however, enhanced survival was observed in mice receiving either HSCCD150+ HSCs, Pre MegE, or Pre CFU-E cells (3/5, 4/8, and 3/8 recipients, respectively; Figure 4B). Survival above background was not detected in mice transplanted with Pre GM and GMP, and no reticulocytes were detected in peripheral blood of surviving mice in these groups (Figure 4B). By contrast, large numbers of reticulocytes were observed in mice transplanted with either Pre MegE (mean 20.7%, n = 4) or Pre CFU-E (mean 7.2%, n = 3) cells. Neither HSCCD150+ nor CFU-E produced substantial amounts of reticulocytes by 12 days (Figure 4B). For HSCs, this is consistent with the notion that extensive erythroid generation from low numbers of primitive HSCs is too slow to be detected 12 days posttransplantation (Uchida et al., 1994Uchida N. Aguila H.L. Fleming W.H. Jerabek L. Weissman I.L. Rapid and sustained hematopoietic recovery in lethally irradiated mice transplanted with purified Thy-1.1lo Lin-Sca-1+ hematopoietic stem cells.Blood. 1994; 83: 3758-3779PubMed Google Scholar). The failure of CFU-E cells to generate a substantial amount of reticulocytes in vivo is consistent with the limited proliferative potential of CFU-E cells in vitro (Figure 2B). Taken together, these data establish that the in vitro lineage potential of these subsets is recapitulated in vivo. These data also demonstrate that ra"

To explore the chromatin modification landscapes in human ES cells, we profiled two histone modifications, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, by ChIP coupled with the paired-end ditags sequencing strategy. H3K4me3 was found to be a prevalent mark and occurred in close proximity to the promoters of two-thirds of total human genes. Among the H3K27me3 loci identified, 56% are associated with promoters and the vast majority of them are comodified by H3K4me3. By deep-transcript digital counting, 80% of H3K4me3 and 36% of comodified promoters were found to be transcribed. Remarkably, we observed that different combinations of histone methylations are associated with genes from distinct functional categories. These global histone methylation maps provide an epigenetic framework that enables the discovery of novel transcriptional networks and delineation of different genetic compartments of the pluripotent cell genome."
https://openalex.org/W2146138975,"The temporal switch from progenitor cell proliferation to differentiation is essential for effective adult tissue repair. We previously reported the critical role of Notch signaling in the proliferative expansion of myogenic progenitors in mammalian postnatal myogenesis. We now show that the onset of differentiation is due to a transition from Notch signaling to Wnt signaling in myogenic progenitors and is associated with an increased expression of Wnt in the tissue and an increased responsiveness of progenitors to Wnt. Crosstalk between these two pathways occurs via GSK3β, which is maintained in an active form by Notch but is inhibited by Wnt in the canonical Wnt signaling cascade. These results demonstrate that the temporal balance between Notch and Wnt signaling orchestrates the precise progression of muscle precursor cells along the myogenic lineage pathway, through stages of proliferative expansion and then differentiation, during postnatal myogenesis."

To investigate this question at a clonal level, we isolated a subpopulation of adult mouse bone marrow that is highly enriched for multilineage in vivo repopulating cells and transplanted these as single cells, or their short-term clonal progeny generated in vitro, into 352 recipients. Of the mice, 93 showed a donor-derived contribution to the circulating white blood cells for at least 4 months in one of four distinct patterns. Serial transplantation experiments indicated that two of the patterns were associated with extensive self-renewal of the original cell transplanted. However, within 4 days in vitro, the repopulation patterns subsequently obtained in vivo shifted in a clone-specific fashion to those with less myeloid contribution. Thus, primitive hematopoietic cells can maintain distinct repopulation properties upon serial transplantation in vivo, although these properties can also alter rapidly in vitro.

The mammalian blood-forming system is a complex dynamic cellular system designed to sustain the required levels of multiple lineages of short-lived mature blood cells throughout life. It is now well established that all mature blood cell types are continuously generated from a relatively small population of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In the adult, this process usually spans many cell divisions during which lineage choices are first progressively restricted and then executed in a well-coordinated sequence (reviewed in Bryder et al., 2006Bryder D.

The properties of multipotent hematopoietic cells and the intrinsic and extrinsic molecular mechanisms that regulate their initial specification and subsequent maintenance or differentiation are among the most intriguing, but still poorly understood, aspects of hematopoiesis. The investigation of these questions has been confounded by the biological heterogeneity now recognized among primitive hematopoietic cells with the same apparent breadth of differentiation potential. One aspect of this heterogeneity is manifested as differences in the durability of mature blood cell production displayed both in vivo (Jones et al., 1990Jones R.J. Wagner J.E. Celano P. Zicha M.S.

The fact that differences in the types of white blood cells (WBCs) produced and the longevity of their production can be associated with phenotypically distinct and prospectively separable subsets of hematopoietic cells has led to the widely held view that the earliest stages of hematopoiesis can be modeled as a simple linear branching hierarchy (Bryder et al., 2006Bryder D.

Historically, LT-HSCs have been conceptualized as a biologically homogeneous population distinct from cells with multilineage but short-term (<4 months) repopulating activity.

Nevertheless, significant variation in the composition, kinetics, and persistence of progeny outputs is a well-recognized hallmark of repopulating cells when their progeny are analyzed at a clonal level in vivo.

To investigate these alternatives, we analyzed the dynamic changes in WBC outputs of a large number of transplanted single cells with long-term repopulating activity (or their immediate clonal progeny generated in vitro). The WBCs produced in vivo were tracked over a 4–6 month period to allow their long-term clonal lineage output activities to be compared. In many cases, the self-renewal activities of the initially injected cell (or clone) and its progeny were also evaluated by performing secondary and tertiary transplants (Figure 1). Based on the WBC repopulation patterns obtained, we divided the cells and clones into four functionally defined subsets. Our findings suggest the existence of at least two subsets of primitive hematopoietic cells that can stably perpetuate recognizable differentiation programs through many self-renewal divisions in vivo yet remain highly susceptible to growth factor-mediated alteration in vitro. The power of single-cell transplants is that all progeny subsequently detected at any time can be ascribed to the same original starting cell. Here we used multiparameter fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate the CD45mid, lineage marker-negative, rhodamine-123dull, Hoechst 33342-excluding side population (CD45midlin−Rho−SP) fraction of normal adult mouse bone marrow (BM) cells, at least 25% of which we have previously shown to be lymphomyeloid repopulating cells that contribute at least 1% of the circulating WBCs for at least 16 weeks (Uchida et al., 2003Uchida N.

USA. 2006; 103: 8185-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We then injected 352 sublethally irradiated Ly5-congenic W41/W41 mice with visually confirmed, single cells of this phenotype (n = 158) or with 4 day in vitro clones (n = 194) generated from such cells under conditions that support a modest expansion of the input HSC number after 10 days in vitro (Audet et al., 2002Audet J.

The use of sublethally irradiated Ly5-congenic W41/W41 mice as recipients enables transplanted repopulating cells to be detected at the same frequency and with similar WBC outputs as in lethally irradiated Ly5-congenic mice in limiting dilution transplantation assays but avoids the complication of having to transplant additional cells to ensure survival of the recipients (Miller and Eaves, 1997Miller C.L.

The number and proportion of myeloid (granulocytes/monocytes, GM) and lymphoid (B cell and T cell) WBCs of the donor Ly5 genotype present in the blood of each of the 352 mice transplanted was then measured 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks later (Figure 1 and see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). In 233 of the 352 mice (66%), ≥0.5% donor-derived WBCs were not seen at any time. In another 26 (7%), a transplant-derived contribution to the circulating WBCs was >0.5% initially but decreased to <1% by 16 weeks posttransplant. These 259 mice were eliminated from all subsequent analyses. In the remaining 93 mice (26%, 49 injected with a single cell and 44 with a 4 day clone), a ≥1% contribution to the regenerated WBCs at 16–24 weeks was seen. These 93 mice were selected for further analysis without requiring that they contain both donor-derived myeloid and lymphoid WBCs at 16 weeks to enable the examination of clones with all possible WBC output patterns. In 92 of the 93 mice analyzed (99%), donor-derived myeloid cells as well as lymphoid cells were detectable, at least at a low level (>0.1% of all myeloid cells), at some time point. For the freshly isolated single cells, 90% (44 of 49) of the long-term repopulated mice produced detectable donor-derived myeloid cells for at least 16 weeks. For the mice transplanted with the 4 day clones, this percentage decreased to 57% (25 of 44). The specific levels of donor-derived WBCs present in each of the 93 mice varied considerably throughout the 6 month period of follow-up (Figure 2A). To determine whether these differences reflected a smaller number of patterns, we analyzed the clonal outputs in various ways. Figure 3 shows the results obtained when we calculated the separate contribution of the transplanted cell(s) in each mouse to each lineage at the 16 week time point and then plotted these values as normalized relative ratios on a ternary graph (see Figure S1for details). This type of analysis showed that the data thus obtained segregated into four clusters. We designated these clusters as α, β, γ, and δ subtypes and the input cells responsible for the respective repopulation patterns as α, β, γ, and δ cells. The α and β clusters were defined, respectively, by donor-derived GM:(B + T) ratios of ≥2 and 0.25 to 2 (see Figure S2, which describes the rationale for, and statistical validation of, these clusters). Mice with donor-derived GM:(B + T) ratios of <0.25 were further subdivided into two clusters according to whether the donor contribution to the myeloid lineage as well as to both lineages of lymphoid cells at 16 weeks continued in each case at ≥1% (γ subtype) or decreased further, leaving a greater contribution to the lymphoid lineages at this time (<1% of the myeloid cells and >1% of the lymphoid cells, δ subtype). Values for transplants of freshly isolated single cells (n = 49) and 4 day clones (n = 44) clustered similarly (Figures S3A and S3B) and were therefore pooled, in spite of changes in the proportional representation of the four different subtypes of repopulation patterns, as described in detail below.Figure 3Identification of Subtypes of Repopulating Cells in Ternary Plots of Their Lineage-Specific Contributions at 16 Weeks PosttransplantShow full caption(A) Comparison of the ratio of donor clone contributions to the GM (up), B lineage (lower left), and T lineage (lower right) WBCs.

The contribution of donor-derived cells to the total number of WBCs at 16 weeks posttransplant was not a highly discriminating feature of each cluster (Figure 2B), although each cluster did display a distinct kinetic pattern of repopulation when the average values were plotted as a function of time posttransplant (Figure 2C). Specific examples of the four repopulation patterns are shown in Figures 2D and 2E. In the upper panels of these figures, the data are displayed as additive contributions of the donor-derived GM, B, and T cell contributions to the total WBC pool as a function of time posttransplant. In the lower panels of these figures, the results are displayed as separate specific contributions to each of the three types of WBCs. When the average lineage-specific contributions were plotted over time, four distinct patterns were again evident (Figure 2F). Pairs of sublethally irradiated Ly5-congenic W41/W41 mice were transplanted with the equivalent of the BM cells from one femur (∼10% of the total BM) harvested individually from 47 of the 93 clonally repopulated mice 6–7 months after the initial cell(s) had been injected. Subsequent follow-up showed that donor-type cells from 22 of the 47 primary mice were contributing ≥1% of the circulating WBCs in one or both of the secondary recipients for at least 16 weeks. Notably, this result was obtained only with transplants from primary mice that had been repopulated with α or β cells and included at least one secondary recipient from almost every such primary mouse tested (cells from 11 of 12 primary recipients of α cells repopulated 19 of 24 secondary mice, and cells from 11 of 12 primary recipients of β cells repopulated 20 of 24 secondary mice, whereas no secondary recipients were repopulated with cells from six primary mice transplanted with γ cells or 17 primary mice transplanted with δ cells, Figure 4A and Figure S4A). Moreover, the subtype of the original cell injected appeared more predictive of secondary repopulating activity than either the total donor-derived WBC levels in the primary recipients or the extent of the individual donor contribution to the GM, B, or T lineages (Figure S4B). Paired tertiary transplants were similarly performed with BM cells harvested from each of 25 repopulated secondary mice. These experiments showed that most of the α and β cells had undergone further expansion in the secondary mice (Figure 4A). Unexpectedly, we found that both the lineage-specific contributions to the WBCs present at 16 weeks in the secondary and tertiary recipients (see examples in Figure 4B) as well as the overall repopulation patterns obtained (see examples in Figure 5A) were highly reminiscent of the four patterns identified in the primary mice. Moreover, comparison of each cohort of serial transplants revealed a striking preservation of each particular repopulation pattern obtained in multiple recipients of cells from the original cell transplanted (see examples 1–3 in Figure 4B for α and β cells, respectively). The similarity in the repopulation patterns displayed by the progeny of individual α or β cells is even more obvious when the paired recipients of cells from the same primary or secondary donors are compared (Figure 5A). Evidence of a change from one repopulation pattern to another was, however, noted in approximately half of the secondary recipients of cells from primary mice repopulated with α or β cells (Figure 4A). Specifically, in 5 of the 11 α cell-repopulated primary mice tested, one or both of the secondary recipients showed a more balanced donor-derived GM:(B + T) ratio at 16 weeks, typical of β cells (examples 3b, 4, and 5 in Figure 4B for α cells). Similarly, in 5 of the 11 β cell-repopulated primary mice tested, one or both of the secondary recipients showed a low donor-derived GM:(B + T) ratio at 16 weeks, typical of γ or δ cells (examples 4 and 5 in Figure 4B for β cells) and a progressive loss of durable myeloid repopulating activity. These findings indicate that some α cells can also produce β cells (and/or γ and δ cells) and some β cells can also give rise to γ and δ cells. However, these pattern switches are clearly not obligatory events in vivo, since many α and β cells sustained for over a year the exclusive production of repopulating cell progeny characterized by the same WBC output patterns. It is important to note that 11 of the initial 16 α cells detected would likely not have been classified as multipotent according to conventional definitions based on the differentiation activity they displayed in the primary recipients, since they had not yet produced >1% of the B and/or T cells in the blood by 1"
https://openalex.org/W2091525085,"The role of cytokines in regulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remains poorly understood. Herein we demonstrate that thrombopoietin (THPO) and its receptor, MPL, are critically involved in postnatal steady-state HSC maintenance, reflected in a 150-fold reduction of HSCs in adult Thpo(-/-) mice. Further, whereas THPO and MPL proved not required for fetal HSC expansion, HSC expansion posttransplantation was highly MPL and THPO dependent. The distinct role of THPO in postnatal HSC maintenance is accompanied by accelerated HSC cell-cycle kinetics in Thpo(-/-) mice and reduced expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p57(Kip2) and p19(INK4D) as well as multiple Hox transcription factors. Although also predicted to be an HSC viability factor, BCL2 failed to rescue the HSC deficiency of Thpo(-/-) mice. Thus, THPO regulates posttransplantation HSC expansion as well as the maintenance of adult quiescent HSCs, of critical importance to avoid postnatal HSC exhaustion."
https://openalex.org/W2082462757,"Mouse hematopoiesis is initiated by long-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that differentiate into a series of multipotent progenitors that exhibit progressively diminished self-renewal ability. In human hematopoiesis, populations enriched for HSC activity have been identified, as have downstream lineage-committed progenitors, but multipotent progenitor activity has not been uniquely isolated. Previous reports indicate that human HSC are enriched in Lin-CD34+CD38- cord blood and bone marrow and express CD90. We demonstrate that the Lin-CD34+CD38- fraction of cord blood and bone marrow can be subdivided into three subpopulations: CD90+CD45RA-, CD90-CD45RA-, and CD90-CD45RA+. Utilizing in vivo transplantation studies and complementary in vitro assays, we demonstrate that the Lin-CD34+CD38-CD90+CD45RA- cord blood fraction contains HSC and isolate this activity to as few as 10 purified cells. Furthermore, we report the first prospective isolation of a population of candidate human multipotent progenitors, Lin-CD34+CD38-CD90-CD45RA- cord blood."
https://openalex.org/W2158668089,"We report here genome-wide mapping of DNA methylation patterns at proximal promoter regions in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. Most methylated genes are differentiation associated and repressed in mES cells. By contrast, the unmethylated gene set includes many housekeeping and pluripotency genes. By crossreferencing methylation patterns to genome-wide mapping of histone H3 lysine (K) 4/27 trimethylation and binding of Oct4, Nanog, and Polycomb proteins on gene promoters, we found that promoter DNA methylation is the only marker of this group present on approximately 30% of genes, many of which are silenced in mES cells. In demethylated mutant mES cells, we saw upregulation of a subset of X-linked genes and developmental genes that are methylated in wild-type mES cells, but lack either H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation or association with Polycomb, Oct4, or Nanog. Our data suggest that in mES cells promoter methylation represents a unique epigenetic program that complements other regulatory mechanisms to ensure appropriate gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1975247371,"Recent studies have proposed that bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are maintained via N-cadherin-mediated homophilic adhesion with osteoblasts. However, there is not yet any evidence that N-cadherin-expressing cells have HSC activity or that osteoblasts are required for HSC maintenance. We were unable to detect N-cadherin expression in highly purified HSCs by polymerase chain reaction, by using commercial anti-N-cadherin antibodies, or by beta-galactosidase staining of N-cadherin gene trap mice. Only N-cadherin-negative bone marrow cells exhibited HSC activity in irradiated mice. Finally, biglycan-deficient mice had significant reductions in trabecular bone and osteoblasts but showed no defects in hematopoiesis, HSC frequency, or function. Thus, reductions in osteoblasts do not necessarily lead to reductions in HSCs. Most bone marrow HSCs in wild-type and biglycan-deficient mice localized to sinusoids, and few localized within five cell diameters of the endosteum. These results question whether significant numbers of HSCs depend on N-cadherin-mediated adhesion to osteoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2041668737,"Isl1+ cardiovascular progenitors and their downstream progeny play a pivotal role in cardiogenesis and lineage diversification of the heart. The mechanisms that control their renewal and differentiation are largely unknown. Herein, we show that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a major component by which cardiac mesenchymal cells modulate the prespecification, renewal, and differentiation of isl1+ cardiovascular progenitors. This microenvironment can be reconstituted by a Wnt3a-secreting feeder layer with ES cell-derived, embryonic, and postnatal isl1+ cardiovascular progenitors. In vivo activation of β-catenin signaling in isl1+ progenitors of the secondary heart field leads to their massive accumulation, inhibition of differentiation, and outflow tract (OFT) morphogenic defects. In addition, the mitosis rate in OFT myocytes is significantly reduced following β-catenin deletion in isl1+ precursors. Agents that manipulate Wnt signals can markedly expand isl1+ progenitors from human neonatal hearts, a key advance toward the cloning of human isl1+ heart progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W2087214029,"The Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene is essential for embryonic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) development, but its role during adult hematopoiesis is unknown. Using an inducible knockout model, we demonstrate that Mll is essential for the maintenance of adult HSCs and progenitors, with fatal bone marrow failure occurring within 3 weeks of Mll deletion. Mll-deficient cells are selectively lost from mixed bone marrow chimeras, demonstrating their failure to self-renew even in an intact bone marrow environment. Surprisingly, HSCs lacking Mll exhibit ectopic cell-cycle entry, resulting in the depletion of quiescent HSCs. In contrast, Mll deletion in myelo-erythroid progenitors results in reduced proliferation and reduced response to cytokine-induced cell-cycle entry. Committed lymphoid and myeloid cells no longer require Mll, defining the early multipotent stages of hematopoiesis as Mll dependent. These studies demonstrate that Mll plays selective and independent roles within the hematopoietic system, maintaining quiescence in HSCs and promoting proliferation in progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W2149011343,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) continuously regenerate the hematologic system, yet few genes regulating this process have been defined. To identify candidate factors involved in differentiation and self-renewal, we have generated an expression database of hematopoietic stem cells and their differentiated progeny, including erythrocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, NK cells, activated and naive T cells, and B cells. Bioinformatic analysis revealed HSCs were more transcriptionally active than their progeny and shared a common activation mechanism with T cells. Each cell type also displayed unique biases in the regulation of particular genetic pathways, with Wnt signaling particularly enhanced in HSCs. We identified approximately 100-400 genes uniquely expressed in each cell type, termed lineage ""fingerprints."" In overexpression studies, two of these genes, Zfp 105 from the NK cell lineage, and Ets2 from the monocyte lineage, were able to significantly influence differentiation toward their respective lineages, demonstrating the utility of the fingerprints for identifying genes that regulate differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2011324987,"The embryonic stem cell differentiation system was used to define the roles of the Activin/Nodal, BMP, and canonical Wnt signaling pathways at three distinct developmental stages during hematopoietic ontogeny: induction of a primitive streak-like population, formation of Flk1(+) mesoderm, and induction of hematopoietic progenitors. Activin/Nodal and Wnt, but not BMP, signaling are required for the induction of the primitive streak. Although BMP is not required for primitive streak induction, it displays a strong posteriorizing effect on this population. All three signaling pathways regulate induction of Flk1(+) mesoderm. The specification of Flk1(+) mesoderm to the hematopoietic lineages requires VEGF and Wnt, but not BMP or Activin/Nodal signaling. Specifically, Wnt signaling is essential for commitment of the primitive erythroid, but not the definitive lineages. These findings highlight dynamic changes in signaling requirements during blood cell development and identify a role for Wnt signaling in the establishment of the primitive erythroid lineage."

By utilizing GATA-1 and PU.1 transcription factor reporters, here we identified progenitor populations that are precursors for either CMPs or CLPs. Two independent populations expressing either GATA-1 or PU.1 resided within the CD34+Sca-1+c-Kit+ MPP fraction. The GATA-1+ MPP displayed potent myeloerythroid potential without giving rise to lymphocytes, whereas the PU.1+ MPP showed granulocyte/monocyte/lymphoid-restricted progenitor activity without megakaryocyte/erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, GATA-1+ and PU.1+ MPPs possessed huge expansion potential and differentiated into the original CMPs and CLPs, respectively. Thus, the reciprocal activation of GATA-1 and PU.1 primarily organizes the hematopoietic lineage fate decision to form the earliest hematopoietic branchpoint that comprises isolatable myeloerythroid and myelolymphoid progenitor populations.

Understanding how multipotent cells commit to each of their terminal fate potentials is an important aspect of stem cell biology. Lineage commitment pathways from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (Spangrude et al., 1991Spangrude G.J. Smith L. Uchida N. Ikuta K. Heimfeld S. Friedman J. Weissman I.L. Mouse hematopoietic stem cells.Blood. 1991; 78: 1395-1402PubMed Google Scholar) have been proposed dependent upon the existence of prospectively isolatable lineage-restricted progenitor populations (Akashi et al., 2005Akashi K.

In adult murine hematopoiesis, HSCs with long-term (LT) self-renewal potential reside within the Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) fraction having CD34− (Osawa et al., 1996Osawa M. Hanada K. Hamada H.

The LSK cells having CD34+, Thy1−, and/or Flt3+ phenotypes are capable of multilineage reconstitution only for a short term and therefore should contain multipotent progenitors (MPPs) (Christensen and Weissman, 2001Christensen J.L.

There has been a controversy in terms of developmental steps downstream of MPPs (Iwasaki and Akashi, 2007Iwasaki H. Akashi K. Myeloid lineage commitment from the hematopoietic stem cell.Immunity. 2007; 26: 726-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). One model suggests that myeloerythroid and lymphoid developmental pathways are largely independent based on the fact that the earliest myeloid and lymphoid progenitors such as the common myeloid progenitor (CMP) (Akashi et al., 2000Akashi K. Traver D. Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. A clonogenic common myeloid progenitor that gives rise to all myeloid lineages.Nature. 2000; 404: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar) and the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) (Kondo et al., 1997Kondo M. Weissman I.L. Akashi K. Identification of clonogenic common lymphoid progenitors in mouse bone marrow.Cell. 1997; 91: 661-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar) are prospectively isolatable outside the LSK fraction. CMPs gave rise to all myeloerythroid cells via developmental intermediates such as the granulocyte/monocyte progenitor (GMP) and the megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitor (MEP) (Akashi et al., 2000Akashi K. Traver D. Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. A clonogenic common myeloid progenitor that gives rise to all myeloid lineages.Nature. 2000; 404: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar), while CLPs are precursors for all lymphoid cells including T, B, and NK cells (Kondo et al., 1997Kondo M. Weissman I.L. Akashi K. Identification of clonogenic common lymphoid progenitors in mouse bone marrow.Cell. 1997; 91: 661-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). Recently, however, several studies have suggested that lineage commitment could occur at the MPP stage, preceding the proposed bifurcation of myeloid and lymphoid pathways. The MPP population contains a fraction of cells expressing the lymphoid lineage-specific recombination activation gene (rag)-1, called the earliest lymphoid progenitor (ELP), which differentiate mainly into lymphoid cells but retain a minor myeloid potential (Igarashi et al., 2002Igarashi H. Gregory S.C. Yokota T. Sakaguchi N. Kincade P.W. Transcription from the RAG1 locus marks the earliest lymphocyte progenitors in bone marrow.Immunity. 2002; 17: 117-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Another study showed that a fraction of MPP expressing Flt3, especially at a high level, does not have megakaryocyte/erythroid (MegE) potential, if any, and is largely primed for the lymphoid lineage. The Flt3+ MPP was therefore termed as the lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor (LMPP) (Adolfsson et al., 2005Adolfsson J. Mansson R. Buza-Vidas N. Hultquist A. Liuba K. Jensen C.T. Bryder D. Yang L. Borge O.J. Thoren L.A. et al.Identification of flt3(+) lympho-myeloid stem cells lacking erythro-megakaryocytic potential a revised road map for adult blood lineage commitment.Cell. 2005; 121: 295-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Because the LMPPs also have considerable GM potential, the coupled loss of self-renewal activity and MegE potential in the early HSC commitment has been proposed (Adolfsson et al., 2005Adolfsson J. Mansson R. Buza-Vidas N. Hultquist A. Liuba K. Jensen C.T. Bryder D. Yang L. Borge O.J. Thoren L.A. et al.Identification of flt3(+) lympho-myeloid stem cells lacking erythro-megakaryocytic potential a revised road map for adult blood lineage commitment.Cell. 2005; 121: 295-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Based on this finding, GM cells could develop without passing through the CMP stage, and the LMPP could be the major pathway for GM cells (Adolfsson et al., 2005Adolfsson J. Mansson R. Buza-Vidas N. Hultquist A. Liuba K. Jensen C.T. Bryder D. Yang L. Borge O.J. Thoren L.A. et al.Identification of flt3(+) lympho-myeloid stem cells lacking erythro-megakaryocytic potential a revised road map for adult blood lineage commitment.Cell. 2005; 121: 295-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). More recently, however, Forsberg et al. reported that the Flt3+ LMPP population possesses robust MegE potential, represented by their ability to produce a significant number of erythroid cells and platelets at a relatively late phase after transplantation (day 12–15), claiming that the CMP and the CLP still constitute the major site for myeloid versus lymphoid lineage decision (Forsberg et al., 2006Forsberg E.C. Serwold T. Kogan S. Weissman I.L. Passegue E. New evidence supporting megakaryocyte-erythrocyte potential of flk2/flt3+ multipotent hematopoietic progenitors.Cell. 2006; 126: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). How can we reconcile the controversy in the early hematopoietic lineage map? Because uncommitted cells prime multiple lineage-affiliated developmental programs at the single-cell level prior to lineage commitment (Hu et al., 1997Hu M. Krause D. Greaves M. Sharkis S. Dexter M. Heyworth C. Enver T. Multilineage gene expression precedes commitment in the hemopoietic system.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), the major question here is whether the GM development program is coprimed with the MegE program at the CMP stage, with the lymphoid program at the LMPP stage, or both. In fact, in previous single-cell PCR studies, a considerable fraction of single CMPs and LMPPs possess GM and MegE, and GM and lymphoid gene transcripts, respectively (Mansson et al., 2007Mansson R. Hultquist A. Luc S. Yang L. Anderson K. Kharazi S. Al-Hashmi S. Liuba K. Thoren L. Adolfsson J. et al.Molecular evidence for hierarchical transcriptional lineage priming in fetal and adult stem cells and multipotent progenitors.Immunity. 2007; 26: 407-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, Miyamoto et al., 2002Miyamoto T. Iwasaki H. Reizis B. Ye M. Graf T. Weissman I.L. Akashi K. Myeloid or lymphoid promiscuity as a critical step in hematopoietic lineage commitment.Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 137-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The problem is that the CMP and the LMPP are still functionally heterogenous populations: the remaining MegE potential in the LMPP (Forsberg et al., 2006Forsberg E.C. Serwold T. Kogan S. Weissman I.L. Passegue E. New evidence supporting megakaryocyte-erythrocyte potential of flk2/flt3+ multipotent hematopoietic progenitors.Cell. 2006; 126: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) raises a possibility that the LMPP contains populations with MegE potential such as MPPs, whereas CMPs possess a weak B cell potential (Akashi et al., 2000Akashi K. Traver D. Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. A clonogenic common myeloid progenitor that gives rise to all myeloid lineages.Nature. 2000; 404: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar), suggesting contamination of B cell precursors. Thus, it is critical to test whether progenitor populations more strictly restricted to the GM and lymphoid lineage (granulocyte/monocyte/lymphoid progenitors, GMLP) or the CMP lacking lymphoid potential could be isolated in pure form in early hematopoiesis. In addition, it is also important to evaluate whether such populations have significant expansion potential sufficient to play a role in maintaining homeostasis of normal hematopoiesis (Spangrude, 2002Spangrude G.J. Divergent models of lymphoid lineage specification: do clonal assays provide all the answers?.Immunol. Rev. 2002; 187: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Hematopoietic development models have been proposed simply by placing known lineage-specific progenitors in a hierarchical order, which are separated based on the difference in the expression level of antigens that may not have significant functions in lineage fate decision (i.e., Sca-1, CD34, Thy-1, and Flt3). One of reasonable approaches for separating functionally distinct populations may include the utilization of markers closely associated with lineage-instructive signaling. In establishing lineage diversities, antagonistic or cooperative effects of multiple transcription factors, called a “transcription factor network” (Orkin, 2000Orkin S.H. Diversification of haematopoietic stem cells to specific lineages.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, Sieweke and Graf, 1998Sieweke M.H. Graf T. A transcription factor party during blood cell differentiation.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), might be critical. The Ets family transcription factor PU.1 (Spi-1) is one of the most important regulators of GM and lymphoid lineage development (Rosenbauer and Tenen, 2007Rosenbauer F. Tenen D.G. Transcription factors in myeloid development: balancing differentiation with transformation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and is necessary for both HSC self-renewal and its generation of early GM and lymphoid progenitors such as CMPs, GMPs, and CLPs (Iwasaki et al., 2005bIwasaki H. Somoza C. Shigematsu H. Duprez E.A. Iwasaki-Arai J. Mizuno S. Arinobu Y. Geary K. Zhang P. Dayaram T. et al.Distinctive and indispensable roles of PU.1 in maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells and their differentiation.Blood. 2005; 106: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). GATA-1 is an essential transcription factor for MegE development (Fujiwara et al., 1996Fujiwara Y. Browne C.P. Cunniff K. Goff S.C. Orkin S.H. Arrested development of embryonic red cell precursors in mouse embryos lacking transcription factor GATA-1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 12355-12358Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Importantly, PU.1 and GATA-1 can exert instructive signals for GM and MegE lineage commitment, respectively (Heyworth et al., 2002Heyworth C. Pearson S. May G. Enver T.

PU.1 inhibits GATA-1 function and erythroid differentiation by blocking GATA-1 DNA binding.Blood. 2000; 96: 2641-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there is a general agreement that the antagonistic interplay of PU.1 and GATA-1 plays a critical role in early hematopoietic fate decision such as the GM or lymphoid versus the MegE lineage commitment (Iwasaki and Akashi, 2007Iwasaki H. Akashi K. Myeloid lineage commitment from the hematopoietic stem cell.Immunity. 2007; 26: 726-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These data led us to hypothesize that tracking the expression profile of PU.1 and GATA-1 in early hematopoiesis may provide critical data on developmental pathways of each lineage. By utilizing mice having GATA-1 or PU.1 transcriptional reporters, we here present a high-resolution map containing lineage-restricted progenitor populations within the MPP population of CD34+ LSK phenotype. We found that MPPs upregulating either PU.1 or GATA-1 are functional GMLPs or CMPs, respectively. PU.1+ GMLPs gave rise to the CLP (Kondo et al., 1997Kondo M. Weissman I.L. Akashi K. Identification of clonogenic common lymphoid progenitors in mouse bone marrow.Cell. 1997; 91: 661-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar) and the GMP, while GATA-1+ CMPs generated the original CMP. Accordingly, this model allows flexibility for GM development, as the GMP can be generated via either the GMLP or the CMP stages. The proposed hematopoietic developmental scheme including these new oligopotent progenitor populations reasonably reconciles a number of current controversies in early hematopoietic development. We first evaluated the expression of PU.1 or GATA-1 in purified conventional stem and progenitor fractions (Akashi et al., 2000Akashi K. Traver D. Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. A clonogenic common myeloid progenitor that gives rise to all myeloid lineages.Nature. 2000; 404: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar, Kondo et al., 1997Kondo M. Weissman I.L.

Heimfeld S. Weissman I.L. Purification and characterization of mouse hematopoietic stem cells.Science. 1988; 241: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). To this end, we used mice harboring the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) knocked into the PU.1 locus (Back et al., 2004Back J. Dierich A. Bronn C. Kastner P. Chan S. PU.1 determines the self-renewal capacity of erythroid progenitor cells.Blood. 2004; 103: 3615-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and the transgenic GATA-1 reporter tagged with GFP (Iwasaki et al., 2005aIwasaki H. Mizuno S.I. Mayfield R. Shigematsu H. Arinobu Y. Seed B. Gurish M.F. Takatsu K. Akashi K. Identification of eosinophil lineage-committed progenitors in the murine bone marrow.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In these mouse lines, the level of GFP is correlated with the PU.1 or GATA-1 protein level (Back et al., 2005Back J. Allman D. Chan S. Kastner P. Visualizing PU.1 activity during hematopoiesis.Exp. Hematol. 2005; 33: 395-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, Iwasaki et al., 2005aIwasaki H.

Med. 2005; 201: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Figure 1A shows the expression of GFP in stem and progenitor cells purified from PU.1GFP/+ mice. LSK cells are composed of CD34− and CD34+ populations that are defined as the LT-HSC and the MPP, respectively (Osawa et al., 1996Osawa M. Hanada K. Hamada H. Nakauchi H. Long-term lymphohematopoietic reconstitution by a single CD34- low/negative hematopoietic stem cell.Science. 1996; 273: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). The vast majority of LSK cells expressed a low level of PU.1-GFP, as we and others have reported (Iwasaki et al., 2005bIwasaki H. Somoza C. Shigematsu H. Duprez E.A. Iwasaki-Arai J. Mizuno S. Arinobu Y. Geary K. Zhang P.

In the myeloerythroid pathway, the GFP level progressively increased as the MPP steps forward into the GMP stage, while it decreased at the MEP stage. In the lymphoid pathway, PU.1-GFP was upregulated in CLPs (Figure 1A), proT and proB cells (data not shown). The pattern of GFP expression was reversed in GATA-1-GFP reporter mice (Figure 1B). GATA-1-GFP was expressed in only a minority of the LSK population but upregulated along the MegE pathway. MEPs expressed a high level of GFP and CMPs expressed negative-to-low levels of GFP, whereas GMPs and CLPs were negative for GFP. Thus, the expression pattern of PU.1 and GATA-1 in early hematopoiesis appeared to be reciprocal, as expected. We next evaluated the expression pattern of Flt3 and of PU.1 and GATA-1 reporters within the LSK fraction. Murine LT-HSCs do not express Flt3 (Adolfsson et al., 2001Adolfsson J. Borge O.J. Bryder D.

Weissman I.L. Flk-2 is a marker in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation: a simple method to isolate long-term stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 14541-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). In normal C57BL6 mice, CD34− LT-HSCs were Flt3−, while a fraction of CD34+ MPPs upregulated Flt3 at a high level (Figure 1D), forming the LMPP population (Adolfsson et al., 2005Adolfsson J. Mansson R. Buza-Vidas N. Hultquist A. Liuba K. Jensen C.T. Bryder D. Yang L. Borge O.J. Thoren L.A. et al.Identification of flt3(+) lympho-myeloid stem cells lacking erythro-megakaryocytic potential a revised road map for adult blood lineage commitment.Cell. 2005; 121: 295-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). In PU.1GFP/+ mice, LT-HSCs were entirely Flt3− and PU.1-GFPlo (PU.1lo) (Figure 1A). In MPPs, a high level of PU.1-GFP (PU.1+) was seen only in a fraction of cells with a high level of Flt3, suggesting that this population represents the earliest hematopoietic stage initiating PU.1 upregulation. In GATA-1-GFP reporter mice (Figure 1B), LT-HSCs were all Flt3− and GFP−. In marked contrast to GFP expression in PU.1GFP/+ mice, GATA-1-GFP+ (GATA-1+) cells were found only in a fraction of MPPs that do not express Flt3 (Figure 1B). Thus, the initial upregulation of PU.1 or GATA-1 occurs independently at the MPP stage in Flt3+ or Flt3− subpopulations, respectively. In RAG1+/GFP mice (Kuwata et al., 1999Kuwata N. Igarashi H. Ohmura T. Aizawa S. Sakaguchi N. Cutting edge: absence of expression of RAG1 in peritoneal B-1 cells detected by knocking into RAG1 locus with green fluorescent protein gene.J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6355-6359PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 1C), GFP was expressed in a fraction of MPPs expressing a high level of Flt3. The Flt3+ MPPs expressing RAG1-GFP (RAG1+) correspond to previously defined ELPs (Igarashi et al., 2002Igarashi H. Gregory S.C. Yokota T. Sakaguchi N. Kincade P.W. Transcription from the RAG1 locus marks the earliest lymphocyte progenitors in bone marrow.Immunity. 2002; 17: 117-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). This population was largely committed to the lymphoid lineage retaining weak GM potential (see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). These data indicate that both PU.1+ MPPs and RAG1+ ELPs reside within the LMPP population. Figure 2A shows the quantitative real-time PCR analysis of PU.1 and GATA-1 mRNA in purified MPP subpopulations. In PU.1GFP/+ mice (upper panels), LT-HSCs and PU.1lo MPPs had a similar low level of PU.1 transcript, whereas PU.1 + MPPs possessed an ∼2-fold higher level of PU.1 transcripts as compared to those in PU.1lo MPPs. In all of these subpopulations, GATA-1 transcripts were below the measurable level. CLPs expressed PU.1 at a level similar to that of PU.1+ MPPs. The PU.1 mRNA level progressively increased along the GM differentiation pathway: CMPs and GMPs expressed 5- and 8-fold higher levels of PU.1 transcripts as compared to those in PU.1lo MPPs, respectively. In contrast, MEPs did not express a measurable level of PU.1 mRNA but had a high level of GATA-1 mRNA. In GATA-1-GFP mice (bottom panels), GATA-1 mRNA was not found in the LT-HSCs or GATA-1− MPPs, while GATA-1+ MPPs had a considerable level of GATA-1 transcripts whose levels were almost equal to those in CMPs. Interestingly, GATA-1+ MPPs possessed an almost 4-fold lower level of PU.1 mRNA as compared to that in GATA-1− MPPs. MEPs possessed GATA-1 transcript at a level ∼6-fold higher than that in GATA-1+ MPPs, whereas GMP or CLPs did not express GATA-1. Thus, the levels of PU.1 or GATA-1 mRNA fairly corresponded to the GFP levels in each subpopulation, and the expression patterns of PU.1 and GATA-1 mRNA were generally reciprocal during hematopoietic development, consistent with the previous finding that transcription of PU.1 and GATA-1 genes is mutually exclusive. The “gold standard” definition for murine HSC is the “LSK” (Ikuta and Weissman, 1992Ikuta K. Weissman I.L.

We thus carefully evaluated the expression level of Sca-1 in PU.1+ and GATA-1+ MPPs. In both PU.1GFP/+ and GATA-1-GFP reporter mice, LT-HSCs expressed Sca-1 at the highest level (Figure 2B). Notably, the PU.1+ and GATA-1+ MPP populations did not express a high level of Sca-1 but expressed Sca-1 only at a low level (Sca-1lo). These data clearly show that the upregulation of either PU.1 or GATA-1 within the LSK fraction occurs along with the decline in the level of Sca-1. We evaluated the differentiation potential of PU.1+ MPPs. Single cells from each LSK subfraction based on CD34 and PU.1 expression gave rise to colonies at high plating efficiencies (>95%) in vitro (Figure 3A). LT-HSCs gave rise to a variety of myeloerythroid colonies. Within the MPP population, Flt3+ LMPP gave rise mainly to GM colonies with only a few percent of MegE colonies, consistent with the previous report that the exclu"

Fragile X syndrome results from FMR1 gene inactivation due to a CGG expansion at the 5′UTR region of the gene. Early events in FMR1 silencing have not been fully characterized due to the lack of appropriate animal or cellular models. Here we show that, despite the presence of a full mutation, affected undifferentiated HESCs express FMR1 and are DNA unmethylated. However, epigenetic silencing by DNA methylation and histone modification occurs upon differentiation. Our unique cell system allows the dissection of the sequence by which these epigenetic changes are acquired and illustrates the importance of HESCs in unraveling developmentally regulated mechanisms associated with human genetic disorders."

We have established a conditional deletion model that allows us to study adult hematopoiesis in the absence of Mll. In this study, Mll−/− embryos survive to E16.5 and have reduced numbers of HSCs. The quiescent fraction of these HSCs is greatly reduced, and they are unable to compete with wild-type cells in transplantation assays. Mice with Mll expression conditionally deleted in the hematopoietic system have grossly normal hematopoiesis in bone marrow, thymus, and spleen. However, transplanted Mll-deficient bone marrow cells are highly compromised in their ability to competitively reconstitute irradiated recipients.

A decrease in stem cell number and/or activity could lead to the aging-related decline in tissue homeostasis. We have analyzed how the process of aging affects germ line stem cell (GSC) behavior in the Drosophila testis and report that significant changes within the stem cell microenvironment, or niche, occur that contribute to a decline in stem cell number over time. Specifically, somatic niche cells in testes from older males display reduced expression of the cell adhesion molecule DE-cadherin and a key self-renewal signal unpaired (upd). Loss of upd correlates with an overall decrease in stem cells residing within the niche. Conversely, forced expression of upd within niche cells maintains GSCs in older males. Therefore, our data indicate that age-related changes within stem cell niches may be a significant contributing factor to reduced tissue homeostasis and regeneration in older individuals."

In some cases, forced exclusion (skipping) of a single exon can restore the reading frame, giving rise to a shorter, but still functional, protein. In this study, we constructed lentiviral vectors expressing antisense oligonucleotides in order to induce an efficient exon skipping and to correct the initial frameshift caused by the DMD deletion of CD133+ stem cells. The intramuscular and intra-arterial delivery of genetically corrected CD133 expressing myogenic progenitors isolated from the blood and muscle of DMD patients results in a significant recovery of muscle morphology, function, and dystrophin expression in scid/mdx mice.

https://openalex.org/W2160193499,"The formation of blood in the embryo is dependent on bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), but how BMP signaling intersects with other regulators of hematopoietic development is unclear. Using embryonic stem (ES) cells, we show that BMP4 first induces ventral-posterior (V-P) mesoderm and subsequently directs mesodermal cells toward blood fate by activating Wnt3a and upregulating Cdx and Hox genes. When BMP signaling is blocked during this latter phase, enforced expression of either Cdx1 or Cdx4 rescues hematopoietic development, thereby placing BMP4 signaling upstream of the Cdx-Hox pathway. Wnt signaling cooperates in BMP-induced hemogenesis, and the Wnt effector LEF1 mediates BMP4 activation of Cdx genes. Our data suggest that BMP signaling plays two distinct and sequential roles during blood formation, initially as an inducer of mesoderm, and later to specify blood via activation of Wnt signaling and the Cdx-Hox pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1973508705,"It is widely postulated that tissue aging could be, at least partially, caused by reduction of stem cell number, activity, or both. However, the mechanisms of controlling stem cell aging remain largely a mystery. Here, we use Drosophila ovarian germline stem cells (GSCs) as a model to demonstrate that age-dependent decline in the functions of stem cells and their niche contributes to overall stem cell aging. BMP signaling activity from the niche significantly decreases with age, and increasing BMP signaling can prolong GSC life span and promote their proliferation. In addition, the age-dependent E-cadherin decline in the stem cell-niche junction also contributes to stem cell aging. Finally, overexpression of SOD, an enzyme that helps eliminate free oxygen species, in either GSCs or their niche alone can prolong GSC life span and increase GSC proliferation. Therefore, this study demonstrates that stem cell aging is controlled extrinsically and intrinsically in the Drosophila ovary."

Using a newly developed brain lipid binding protein (BLBP)-Cre mouse strain to study the role of neurofibromin in neural progenitor cell function in the intact animal, we now show that neuroglial progenitor Nf1 inactivation results in increased glial lineage proliferation and abnormal neuronal differentiation in vivo. Whereas the glial cell lineage abnormalities are recapitulated by activated Ras or Akt expression in vivo, the neuronal abnormalities were Ras- and Akt independent and reflected impaired cAMP generation in Nf1-deficient cells in vivo and in vitro. Together, these findings demonstrate that neurofibromin is required for normal glial and neuronal development involving separable Ras-dependent and cAMP-dependent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2164991328,"Adult epithelial stem cells are thought to reside in specific niches, where they are maintained by adhesion to stromal cells and by intercellular signals. In niches that harbor multiple adjacent stem cells, such as those maintaining Drosophila germ cells, lost stem cells are replaced by division of neighboring stem cells or reversion of transit cells. We have characterized the Drosophila follicle stem cell (FSC) niche as a model of the epithelial niche to learn whether nonneighboring cells can also generate stem cell replacements. Exactly two stroma-free FSC niches holding single FSCs are located in fixed locations on opposite edges of the Drosophila ovariole. FSC daughters regularly migrate across the width of the ovariole to the other niche before proliferating and contributing to the follicle cell monolayer. Crossmigrating FSC daughters compete with the resident FSC for niche occupancy and are the source of replacement FSCs. The ability of stem cell daughters to target a distant niche and displace its resident stem cell suggests that precancerous mutations might spread from niche to niche within stem cell-based tissues."

Identifying adult kidney stem cells in Drosophila may provide important clues for understanding mammalian kidney repair and regeneration during injury. Human or mammalian kidneys develop from two sources: ureteric bud (metanephric diverticulum) and the metanephric mesoderm (Saxen, 1987Saxen L. Organogenesis of the Kidney. Cambridge University Press, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar, Moore, 1988Moore K.L. The urogenital system.in: Moore K.L. The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology. W.B.

A mature kidney consists of two parts: a nephron, derived from the metanephric mesoderm, and a collecting tubule, derived from the ureteric bud. Tissue culture studies have shown that the mutual induction of ureteric bud and metanephric mesoderm direct the kidney formation. The branching of the ureteric bud is dependent upon induction by the metanephric mesoderm, and the differentiation of the nephrons relies on the induction by the collecting tubules (Moore, 1988Moore K.L. The urogenital system.in: Moore K.L. The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology. W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, PA1988: 246-286Google Scholar, Saxen, 1987Saxen L.

The ureteric bud and its branched derivatives first invade the metanephric mesoderm, induce the mesenchymal cells undergoing a structural transition, and become a second polarized epithelium. The two neighboring cell layers then fuse to form a single epithelial structure, the kidney. The epithelium originating from the ureteric bud will give rise to the ureter and the collecting ducts, whereas the metanephric mesoderm-derived portion will form the nephrons and glomerulli, the blood-filtering and urine-producing tubular units of the mature kidney. The Drosophila kidneys (Malpighian tubules or MTs) also develop from two sources: hindgut primordium (ectodermal epithelia) and the visceral mesoderm (Denholm et al., 2003Denholm B. Sudarsan V. Pasalodos-Sanchez S. Artero R. Lawrence P. Maddrell S. Baylies M. Skaer H. Dual origin of the renal tubules in Drosophila mesodermal cells integrate and polarise to establish secretory function.Curr.

Shilo B.Z. Modular tubes: common principles of renal development.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R511-R513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Early in embryogenesis, interaction between the midgut and the hindgut anlagen refines the expression domain of the transcription factor Krüppel (Kr). Kr further regulates the expression of another transcription factor, Cut. As a consequence of Kr and Cut expression, the cells change shape and the MT primordia evert from the hindgut. In parallel to Kr and Cut, the wingless (Wg) also plays a role in MT cell allocation. Within the tubule primordia, a cell called the tip cell is specified via the Notch pathway. The tip cell expresses Kr and also secretes epidermal growth factor (EGF). The EGF then stimulates mitosis in neighboring cells and the growth of tubules by addition of new cells. The tubules then enter the vicinity of the caudal mesoderm and interact with a subpopulation of the caudal mesoderm to induce the mesoderm cells to undergo a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. The mesoderm-derived, polarized epithelium then progressively incorporates into the tubule epithelium as stellate cells (SCs), whereas the ectoderm-derived epithelium becomes the principal cells (PCs) and the ureter. The above information illustrates that common principles, such as the interaction of two distinct cell populations, are used in the development of the mammalian kidney and Drosophila MTs. Even the pathway (Wnt) or molecules (Kr-Glis2/Klf-6, Cut-Cux-1) that are involved in the induction of tubulogenesis or cell differentiation (Hibris-Nephron) seem to have been conserved through evolution (Denholm et al., 2003Denholm B.

The adult Drosophila has four MTs, a longer anterior, and a short posterior pair, which converge through common ureters onto the alimentary canal (Pugatcheva and Mamon, 2003Pugatcheva O.M. Mamon L.A.

Each tubule of the longer anterior pair can be divided in four compartments: initial, transitional, main (secretary), and proximal (reabsorptive) (Figure 1A). The latter can be further divided into lower tubule and ureter. The first three compartments of each tubule consist of two cell types and ∼150 cells. Type I cells, also known as principal or primary cells, through which cations and organic solutes are transported, are the major tubule cell type (∼80%); type II cells, also known as secondary or stellate cells, through which water and chloride ion flow (Jung et al., 2005Jung A.

The type I cells express the transcription factor Cut, and the type II cells express the transcription factor Teashirt (TSH) (Jung et al., 2005Jung A. Denholm B. Skaer H. Affolter M.

The cut-positive type I cells are found in the initial, transitional, and main segments, and the region of lower tubules and ureters, whereas the type II cells are located in the initial, transitional, and main segments of the tubules but were not found in either lower tubules or ureters (Pugatcheva and Mamon, 2003Pugatcheva O.M.

The tiny cells were proposed to be homologs of myoendocrine cells of the ants Formica, which collect the urine in the renal duct and secrete neurohormones in the hemolymph. It is well known that some adult mammal renal tissues that are lost through injury can be repaired or regenerated. Ischemic injury to the kidney causes death of renal cells, followed by tubular regeneration and recovery of renal function. In animal models, the completely lost glomerular structures can be regenerated after immunologic injury (Haller et al., 2005Haller H. Groot K.D. Bahlmann F. Elger M. Fliser D. Stem cells and progenitor cells in renal disease.Kidney Int. 2005; 68: 1932-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In amphibians, such as skate and shark (Elger et al., 2003Elger M. Hentschel H. Litteral J. Wellner M. Kirsch T. Luft F.C. Haller H. Nephrogenesis is induced by partial nephrectomy in the elasmobranch Leucoraja erinacea.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1506-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the adult animal can regenerate new nephrons. However, the source of the proliferating cells that repopulate the injured nephrons or regenerate the lost renal tissues is not clear. In a recent report, Oliver et al. discovered that the renal papilla contains large numbers of slowly cycling cells and may be a niche for adult kidney stem cells. These slow-cycling cells quickly enter the cell cycle and may participate in renal regeneration after ischemic injury (Oliver et al., 2004Oliver J.A. Maarouf O. Cheema F.H. Martens T.P. Al-Awqati Q. The renal papilla is a niche for adult kidney stem cells.J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In the little skate, Leucoraja erinacea, a nephrogenic zone has been identified in the adult kidney (Elger et al., 2003Elger M. Hentschel H. Litteral J. Wellner M. Kirsch T. Luft F.C. Haller H. Nephrogenesis is induced by partial nephrectomy in the elasmobranch Leucoraja erinacea.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1506-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The zone contains stem cell-like mesenchymal cells. These pioneer works strongly suggested the existence of adult kidney stem cells and identified their proximate location in the kidney. However, additional studies are needed to identify these cells and confirm their “stemness,” such as self-renewal and the ability to generate more than one terminally differentiated cell type. The adult Drosophila MTs have been thought to be very stable (Skaer, 1993Skaer H. The alimentary canal.in: Bate M. Martinez A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Lab, New York1993: 941-1012Google Scholar). The developmental program of the tubules is mostly completed during embryogenesis. During metamorphosis, the other parts of the gut are entirely remodeled, the larval gut is degenerated, and the adult gut is formed. The MTs are an exception; they did not remodel during metamorphosis and remain almost unmodified in the adult. No adult stem cells have been described in the MTs. In this report, we show that the tiny cells in the region of lower tubules and ureters function as multipotent adult stem cells and that an autocrine JAK-STAT signaling regulates the stem cells' self-renewal. We re-examined the cell types in the MTs with an antibody to Cut and a tsh-lacZ enhancer trap line. Consistent with previous reports, we found that the Cut-positive type I cells are in the whole MTs (including initial, transitional, main segments, lower tubules, and ureters; Figures 1C, 1E, and 1F), whereas the β-gal-positive type II cells are only found in the upper tubules (including initial, transitional, and main segments; Figures 1C and 1E). The nuclei of the type I cells are larger than those of the type II cells (Figures 1B and 1D). The β-gal-positive type II cells have “stellate” morphology in the main segments and have “bar-shaped” morphology in the initial and transitional segments. The posterior midgut expresses neither Cut nor tsh-lacZ (Figure 1F, yellow arrow). The lower tubules and ureters are composed of three types of cells based on their nuclear sizes (Figures 2A and 2B). The first type has a small nucleus (white arrowhead in Figure 2A) and mostly lies close to the tubular walls (Figure 2B). Cells of the second type are Cut positive (Figures 1C and 1F), have large and oval nuclei (white arrow in Figure 2A), and are distant from the tubular walls (Figure 2B). The small cells may correspond to the previously reported tiny cells in the lower tubules and ureters (Sözen et al., 1997Sözen M.A. Armstrong J.D. Yang M. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. Functional domains are specified to single-cell resolution in a Drosophila epithelium.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 5207-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cells of the third type have intermediate nuclear size (green arrowhead in Figure 2A) and may be the transition type cells between the small and large nuclear cells. To further characterize the proliferating cells in the MTs, we performed 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation experiments. We found that BrdU labels all three cell types in the region of lower tubules and ureters (Figure 2C). No BrdU-labeled cells were detected in the upper tubules (data not shown). In both larvae and adult tissues, many cells undergo endoreplication (Edgar and Orr-Weaver, 2001Edgar B.A. Orr-Weaver T.L. Endoreplication cell cycles: More for less.Cell. 2001; 105: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Both endoreplicating and dividing cells synthesize new DNAs and can be labeled by BrdU. We further stained the tissue for phospho-histone H3 to distinguish endoreplicating from dividing cells in the MTs. Although BrdU labels all three cell types in the region of the lower tubules and ureters, the phospho-histone H3 staining was only detected among the population of cells with small nuclei (Figures 2D and 2E, yellow arrows; Figures 2I and 2J, white arrows). These data suggest that the cells with small nuclei are dividing and the cells with intermediate and large nuclei are undergoing endoreplication. We also stained the tissue for Armadillo (Arm, the β-catenin homolog). The Arm staining clearly outlined the small nuclear cells in the region of lower tubules and ureters (Figure 2F). To characterize the tiny cells further, we searched for additional cell-specific molecular markers in the MTs. We found that the transcription factors escargot (esg; Figures 2G and 2I) and kr (Figures 2H and 2J) are specifically expressed in the small nuclear cells (arrows) in the region of the lower tubules and ureters. We further found that both esg and kr occasionally label a pair of phospho-histone H3-positive dividing cells (Figures 2I and 2J, arrows). The function of the esg gene is to maintain cells as diploid in Drosophila imaginal cells (Fuse et al., 1994Fuse N. Hirose S. Hayashi S. Diploidy of Drosophila imaginal cells is maintained by a transcriptional repressor encoded by escargot.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2270-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, the esg-positive small nuclear cells in MTs are likely diploid cells. In the Drosophila digestive system, the region of lower tubules and ureters is anatomically next to the posterior midgut, a transcriptional reporter of the Notch signaling pathway (Su[H]GBE-lacZ), and the transcription factor Prospero (Pros) were reported to be expressed in the small cells in the posterior midgut (Micchelli and Perrimon, 2005Micchelli C.A.

Spradling A. The adult Drosophila posterior midgut is maintained by pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2005; 439: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). We checked the Su(H)GBE-lacZ and Pros in the MTs and found that neither Su(H)GBE-lacZ nor Pros is expressed in the region of lower tubules and ureters (data not shown). Therefore, the MTs and posterior midgut express different molecular markers; Cut and tsh-lacZ are expressed only in the MTs and not in the posterior midgut (Figure 1F), whereas Su(H)GBE-lacZ and Pros are only expressed in the posterior midgut and not in the MTs. Therefore, the MTs and posterior midgut are composed of distinct cell types. To find out whether the MTs are maintained by stem cells, we first used a positively marked mosaic lineage (PMML) labeling technique (Kirilly et al., 2005Kirilly D. Spana E.P. Perrimon N. Padgett R.W. Xie T. BMP signaling is required for controlling somatic stem cell self-renewal in the Drosophila ovary.Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 651-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) to label and trace cells that undergo mitotic divisions. The production of GFP-marked clones is dependent on mitotic recombination. Therefore, the technique allowed us to directly detect proliferating cells. The adult flies bearing transgenes of a heat shock-inducible flipase (hs-FLP), a reporterless actin5C promoter, and a promoterless Gal4 with a UAS-EGFP were heat shocked to induce FLP-FRT-mediated mitotic recombination and generate an active actin5C-Gal4 for driving UAS-EGFP expression. After heat shock in 2-, 5-, or 10-day-old wild-type adult flies, GFP-marked clones were detected only in the region of the lower tubules and ureters, and not in the upper tubules of the MTs (Figure 3A). No GFP-marked clones were detected in control animals that had identical genotypes but did not undergo heat shock treatment (data not shown). Two days after clone induction (ACI), the GFP primarily labeled the small nuclear cells (white arrows in Figures 3A and 3B). Only one large nuclear cell clone (white arrowhead in Figure 3A) was usually detected in each MT. As described below, the marked small nuclear cell is a stem clone, and the marked, large nuclear cell is a nonstem cell, “transient” clone. Because the nonstem cell clones are very infrequent, these cells must have very limited proliferation potential. We further traced the GFP-marked clones for 4, 6, and 10 days ACI to follow the fates of the marked cells. At 4 and 6 days ACI, the GFP clones were restricted primarily to the region of the lower tubules and ureters (Figures 3C-–3H). In this region, the GFP marked individual small nuclear cells (yellow arrows in Figure 3G) and cluster cells with small, intermediate, and large nuclei (two examples are shown in large views in Figures 3C–3F). By observing the clonal expansion from 4 to 6 days ACI, we found that most basal diploid cells (white arrowheads in Figures 3C and 3E) function as stem cells, which we term the renal and nephric stem cells (RNSCs). The RNSCs contacted their immature diploid daughters (white arrows in Figures 3C and 3E), which we term the renalblast (RB). After additional RNSC divisions, the former RB began to expand in size and DNA content, becoming intermediate and large nuclear cells (Figures 3C–3F). The intermediate and large nuclear cells in the region of the lower tubules and ureters expressed Cut but may function differently from the Cut-positive type I cells in the upper tubules because the upper and lower tubules of MTs have distinguishable functions in excreting the waste products. We term the intermediate and large nuclear cells the early and late renalcyte (RC). At 4 and 6 days ACI, the GFP also marked some diploid small nuclear cells in the main segments (Figure 3I). The GFP-marked small nuclear cells in the main segments likely came from the lower tubules because they were not in the main segments 2 days ACI. Further, these main-segment small nuclear cells did not proliferate and never formed clusters of cells; they moved up and differentiated into both TSH-positive and Cut-positive cells in the initial and transition segments at 10 days ACI (Figures 3L–3N). At 10 days ACI, the GFP labeled the entire MT. In the region of lower tubules and ureters, the GFP marked individual small nuclear cells and cluster cells with small, intermediate, and large nuclei (Figures 3J and 3K); in the main segments, the GFP labeled small nuclear cells (similar to Figure 3I); and in the initial and transition segments, the GFP labeled both TSH-positive type II and Cut-positive type I cells (Figures 3L–3N). The ratio of TSH-positive:Cut-positive cells was about 4:1, suggesting that the type II cells turn over faster than type I cells in the upper tubules. We also used another sensitive lineage labeling method that did not rely on Gal4 (Harrison and Perrimon, 1993Harrison D.A. Perrimon N. A simple and efficient generation of marked clones in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 424-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In these experiments, clones expressing a nuclear-targeted β-galactosidase (β-gal) protein were generated after the adult flies bearing transgenes of a hs-FLP, a reporterless tubulin promoter, and a promoterless lacZ were heat shocked to induce FLP-FRT-mediated mitotic recombination and generate an active tubulin promoter-lacZ gene. Similar results were observed by using the second clone marking technique (data not shown). The above data suggest that the small nuclear cells in the regions of the lower tubules and ureters function as multipotent stem cells in the renal tubules. An RNSC can produce one RB through asymmetric division. The RB can have two fates. In the region of lower tubules and ureters, the RB can become a mature RC in about 5 days through endoreplication. The RB can also move toward the distal upper tubules and finally differentiate into a type I or II cell in the transitional and initial segments. It takes about 10 days for an RB to move up and finally differentiate into a type I or II cell in the transitional and initial segments. In Drosophila testis and ovary, germline stem cells are anchored to a group of nondividing somatic cells. These somatic cells reside in a fixed location and function as stem cell niches. In the MTs, the RNSCs do not attach to any particular cell types and are scattered over the region of the lower tubules and ureters. We wondered how the RNSCs are regulated in such an arrangement. To identify the signaling that regulates the RNSC self-renewal, we examined the expression of the components of the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway in MTs because the signaling regulates stem cell self-renewal in several other stem cell systems (Decotto and Spradling, 2005Decotto E.

A secreted glycoprotein, Unpaired (Upd), is a ligand of the Dome receptor (Harrison et al., 1998Harrison D.A. McCoon P.E. Binari R. Gilman M. Perrimon N. Drosophila unpaired encodes a secreted protein that activates the JAK signaling pathway.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3252-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).

The pathway is also regulated by a negative regulator, Socs36E (Callus and Mathey-Prevot, 2002Callus B.A. Mathey-Prevot B.

The activated Stat92E then enters the nucleus to activate its target genes' transcription (Arbouzova and Zeidler, 2006Arbouzova N.I. Zeidler M.P. JAK/STAT signaling in Drosophila:insights into conserved regulatory and cellular functions.Development. 2006; 133: 1605-1616Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We first examined the receptor dome expression in the MTs by using the dome-Gal4/UAS-GFP flies. The dome-Gal4/UAS-GFP was expressed in a mosaic pattern in the MTs (Figure 4A). In the region of the lower tubules and ureters, it was expressed in both small and large nuclear cells (Figure 4B). We also examined upd expression in the upd-Gal4/UAS-GFP flies and found that the upd-Gal4/UAS-GFP was only expressed in the single small nuclear cells in the region of lower tubules and ureters (Figures 4C and 4D, arrows). Some of the upd-Gal4/UAS-GFP-labeled cells were also phospho-histone H3 positive (Figure 4E, arrow). However, unlike the esg-Gal4/UAS-GFP (Figure 2I) and the kr-Gal4/UAS-GFP (Figure 2J), the upd-Gal4/UAS-GFP only labeled a single phospho-histone H3-positive cell (Figure 4E) and never labeled a pair of phospho-histone H3-positive dividing cells (compare Figure 4E with Figures 2I and 2J). It is likely that upd is only expressed in RNSCs, and esg and kr are expressed in both RNSCs and RBs. One pair of anterior MTs had an average of 97 upd-expressed cells (n = 12), 157 esg-expressed cells (n = 7), and 174 kr-expressed cells (n = 8). If we consider that half of the esg-expressed cells or the kr-expressed cells are RNSCs, the total number of R"

A hurdle that has challenged the widespread adoption of this technique has been the inability to transduce mammary stem cells effectively. We have overcome this limitation by infecting total primary mammary epithelial cells in suspension with high-titer lentiviruses. Transduced cells gave rise to all major cell types of the mammary gland and were capable of clonal outgrowth and functional differentiation in serial transplants.

Importantly, this method is also applicable to transduction of cells from other tissues. The mammary gland is a unique organ in that most of its development occurs postnatally (Wiseman and Werb, 2002Wiseman B.S. Werb Z. Stromal effects on mammary gland development and breast cancer.Science. 2002; 296: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). In mice, the mammary gland develops from a rudimentary branched epithelial structure to a highly ramified ductal network by 10 weeks postparturition (Sternlicht et al., 2006Sternlicht M.D. Kouros-Mehr H. Lu P. Werb Z. Hormonal and local control of mammary branching morphogenesis.Differentiation. 2006; 74: 365-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This process is driven by specialized structures called terminal end buds (TEBs), which are located at the distal tip of developing ducts and mediate invasion into the surrounding fat pad (Hinck and Silberstein, 2005Hinck L. Silberstein G.B. Key stages in mammary gland development: the mammary end bud as a motile organ.Breast Cancer Res. 2005; 7: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The subtending ducts form a continuous epithelium consisting of an outer basal layer of contractile myoepithelial cells and an inner layer of luminal cells. During pregnancy, systemic hormones induce the development of lobuloalveoli from ducts that functionally differentiate at parturition to produce milk. The lobuloalveoli regress at the end of lactation, and the mammary gland returns to a morphological state similar to that found in virgin mice (Richert et al., 2000Richert M.M. Schwertfeger K.L. Ryder J.W. Anderson S.M. An atlas of mouse mammary gland development.J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2000; 5: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). This process of functional differentiation and regression occurs during each round of pregnancy and is termed the “mammary cycle” (Clarkson, 2002Clarkson R. IkB kinase alpha: a link in the chain of the mammary cycle.Breast Cancer Res. 2002; 4: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Nearly half a century of research has established the existence of a rare, multipotent stem cell population that regulates postnatal growth and functional differentiation of the mammary gland (Daniel et al., 1968Daniel C.W. De Ome K.B. Young J.T. Blair P.B. Faulkin Jr., L.J. The in vivo life span of normal and preneoplastic mouse mammary glands: a serial transplantation study.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Landmark studies demonstrated that ductal fragments from any region of the mammary gland have a capacity to regenerate a functional gland upon orthotopic transplantation that is independent of the age of donor mice (Deome et al., 1959Deome K.B. Faulkin Jr., L.J. Bern H.A. Blair P.B.

More recently, two groups have isolated mammary stem cell (MaSC)-enriched mammary epithelial cell (MEC) populations by using antibodies against the cell-surface proteins CD24 (heat-stable antigen) in combination with either CD29 (β1-integrin) or CD49f (α6-integrin) (Shackleton et al., 2006Shackleton M.

While these MEC populations have significantly increased outgrowth capacity, the MaSCs still represent only a small proportion of the enriched population. Although mechanisms of MaSC differentiation are unknown, the progeny of these rare adult stem cells contribute to a hierarchy of progenitors that are committed to either ductal or lobuloalveolar cell fates (Kordon and Smith, 1998Kordon E.C. Smith G.H. An entire functional mammary gland may comprise the progeny from a single cell.Development. 1998; 125: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Smith, 1996Smith G.H.

Genetically engineered mice (GEM) are costly and time consuming to develop. In addition, the hormonally sensitive promoters used to target genes to the mammary epithelium are most active during pregnancy and lactation and drive expression in embryonic mammary glands as well as several other tissues (Wagner et al., 1997Wagner K.U. Wall R.J. St-Onge L. Gruss P. Wynshaw-Boris A. Garrett L. Li M. Furth P.A. Hennighausen L. Cre-mediated gene deletion in the mammary gland.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4323-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Viral-mediated gene expression does not require tissue-specific promoters but has thus far only been successful with genes that provide a selective advantage during outgrowth (Du et al., 2006Du Z.

When we used MSCV-Myc, a virus that coexpresses the oncogene c-myc with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (Cormack et al., 1996Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. FACS-optimized mutants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP).Gene. 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar), we observed outgrowths with almost the entire ductal network positive for EGFP fluorescence in most transplants, as reported previously (Welm et al., 2005Welm A.L.

Values represent mean ± SD.d The area of fluorescence was determined in eight fields from three representative outgrowths. Open table in a new tab We next asked why there was poor EGFP expression in outgrowths from nononcogenic vectors. We observed that MEC colonies in monolayer cultures had two distinct cell populations: cells located at the periphery of a colony had an elongated appearance and were preferentially infected, whereas cells in the center of a colony were cuboidal and poorly infected (Figure 1E). This difference in transduction efficiency occurred with all virus types and was not due to a difference in proliferation, since both populations exhibited significant bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (see Figure S1 available online). We transplanted the peripheral and central cells that were separated by differential trypsinization and identified the central cells as the population with the highest MaSC content (Figure 1F). Thus, the MEC population with the greatest stem cell activity was poorly targeted by the monolayer infection method, regardless of the virus type used. To improve transgenic outgrowth efficiency, we modified the protocol to infect primary MECs in suspension rather than in monolayer. In addition to increasing the cell-surface area accessible to virus, this method raises the effective viral titer by reducing the culture volume needed during the infection. We infected MaSC-enriched central cells from monolayer cultures or freshly prepared MECs. During the overnight infection in suspension, MECs formed large multicellular clusters (Figure 1G) composed of cells that expressed myoepithelial and luminal epithelial markers (Figure S1). Cells that failed to cluster were enriched for blood cell, stromal, and apoptotic markers and were depleted during washes prior to transplantation (Figure S1). Most of the transplants derived from HIV-EGFP-infected aggregates gave rise to outgrowths that exhibited fluorescence throughout their ductal epithelium (Figures 1H and 1I and Table 1). In contrast, few outgrowths from MMLV-EGFP-infected MECs showed any fluorescence (Table 1). This reduced efficiency of MMLV-EGFP may result, in part, from the low proliferation rate observed in aggregated MECs (Figure S1). Collectively, these data show that infecting MECs in suspension with a lentivirus increases the representation of transduced cells in outgrowths. This suggests that combining lentiviral vectors with the suspension infection technique efficiently targets MaSCs. If MaSCs are transduced in suspension, we would expect EGFP to be expressed in all epithelial lineages of the mammary gland. In outgrowths derived from freshly prepared MECs infected with HIV-EGFP, we detected EGFP in myoepithelial cells, in both estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative luminal epithelium, and in lobuloalveoli of pregnant mammary glands (Figures 2A–2C and data not shown). Importantly, EGFP was not detected in periductal cells, indicating that transduced stroma does not contribute significantly to transgenic outgrowths (Figures 2A and 2B). Since stem cells self-renew, transduced MaSCs should contribute to stem and progenitor populations in serially transplanted outgrowths. We transplanted small ductal fragments (<1.0 mm3) from lentiviral-infected primary outgrowths into secondary hosts and stained dissociated cells from both primary and secondary transplants with CD24 and CD49f antibodies (Stingl et al., 2006Stingl J.

FACS analysis of primary and secondary outgrowths derived from HIV-EGFP-infected MECs revealed that transduced cells were present among mammary-colony-forming cells (MaCFC), myoepithelial cells (Myo), and the MaSC-containing mammary-repopulating units (MRU) (Figure 2D). The mammary gland contains at least three distinct progenitor populations: two have limited differentiation capacity and give rise to either ducts or alveoli upon transplantation, while only one is multipotent and capable of generating an entire functional mammary gland (Shackleton et al., 2006Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K. Asselin-Labat M.L. Wu L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E.

We serially transplanted ductal fragments from a 7-month-old primary outgrowth, derived from freshly prepared MECs infected with a lentivirus expressing Zsgreen (Matz et al., 1999Matz M.V. Fradkov A.F. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Zaraisky A.G. Markelov M.L. Lukyanov S.A. Fluorescent proteins from nonbioluminescent Anthozoa species.Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar) (HIV-ZsGreen), into secondary and subsequently tertiary hosts to establish whether multipotent MaSCs were transduced. We observed Zsgreen fluorescence in each generation of transplants: throughout the ductal network of virgin recipients (Figure 2E and data not shown) and in lobuloalveoli of pregnant recipients (Figures 2F and 5M). These observations demonstrate that transduced MECs were capable of giving rise to both ducts and lobuloalveoli in serial transplants and imply that multipotent progenitors with regenerative capacity were targeted by the infection method. We next performed Southern blot analysis on DNA from the serially transplanted HIV-Zsgreen outgrowths to determine the viral integration patterns during each generation of outgrowth. A recurrence of these patterns in successive outgrowth generations would confirm that MaSCs were transduced (Kordon and Smith, 1998Kordon E.C. Smith G.H. An entire functional mammary gland may comprise the progeny from a single cell.Development. 1998; 125: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Smith and Boulanger, 2002Smith G.H. Boulanger C.A. Mammary stem cell repertoire: new insights in aging epithelial populations.Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Southern blots from primary outgrowths (Figure 2Ga–2Gc) often showed many bands together with a broad background smear that was absent in the wild-type negative control (Figure 2G, WT), suggesting that these transplants were derived from several transduced MaSCs and progenitors. Consistent with this notion, 16 secondary transplants derived from one primary outgrowth (Figure 2Gd–2Gh and data not shown) displayed a total of seven different integration patterns, each consisting of one to four distinct viral integrations. Interestingly, nine outgrowths exhibited the same doublet pattern (Figure 2Gf and data not shown). The reduction in the number of viral integrations per outgrowth and the duplication of these patterns in several secondary outgrowths suggest that these transplants were derived from one or few MaSCs. We then analyzed the tertiary transplants to determine whether these integration patterns would persist or segregate in serially related outgrowths. We observed the same doublet pattern in six of six tertiary outgrowths derived from one secondary transplant (compare Figure 2Gf to Figure 2Gf′, and data not shown). Furthermore, two tertiary transplants, each derived from a separate secondary outgrowth, displayed distinct patterns that were also observed in Southern blots from the secondary transplants (compare Figure 2Gg to Figure 2Gg′ and Figure 2Gh to Figure 2Gh′). These observations are consistent with earlier reports by Smith and colleagues demonstrating that retrovirally tagged epithelial fragments can give rise to clonally dominant outgrowths upon serial transplantation (Kordon and Smith, 1998Kordon E.C. Smith G.H. An entire functional mammary gland may comprise the progeny from a single cell.Development. 1998; 125: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Smith and Boulanger, 2002Smith G.H.

Taken together, our data demonstrate that the 2 × 105 total primary MECs we routinely transplant contain multiple MaSCs, most of which are transduced with one to four viruses during the overnight infection in suspension. The previous results prompted us to examine the degree of cellular heterogeneity in outgrowths derived from MECs transplanted at nonlimiting dilutions. Aliquots of freshly prepared MECs were separately infected with either HIV-Zsgreen or a lentivirus that expressed a monomeric red fluorescent protein (Campbell et al., 2002Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. A monomeric red fluorescent protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar) fused to histone H2B (Kanda et al., 1998Kanda T. Sullivan K.F. Wahl G.M. Histone-GFP fusion protein enables sensitive analysis of chromosome dynamics in living mammalian cells.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) (HIV-H2BmRFP). The separately infected populations were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, and a total of 2 × 105 MECs were transplanted. The majority of outgrowths had both monochromatic and dichromatic regions, with the latter often displaying several patterns of fluorescence (Figure 3A and Movie S1). Most ductal segments in dichromatic regions were highly intermixed (Figure 3B and Movie S2), resulting in an amalgamation of red and green cells, while some ducts consisted of a dominant fluorescent cell type with focal cell clusters of the alternate color (Figure 3C and Movie S3). Interestingly, fluorescent patterns were not always maintained along an entire duct or its associated side branches. For example, a dichromatic duct could transition into a monochromatic duct or have side branches with a single dominant color (Figures 3A and 3D and Movie S4). We then bred some transplant recipient mice and observed that lobuloalveoli in late-pregnant outgrowths often displayed a dominant fluorescent color or were monochromatic rather than being highly intermixed (Figures 3F–3H). Thus, when MECs are transplanted at nonlimiting dilutions, both entire outgrowths and individual ducts can be derived from multiple progenitors, while lobuloalveoli may originate from a single dominant alveolar progenitor. We next hypothesized that these intermixed two-color outgrowths would transition to a predominantly monochromatic fluorescent phenotype if fewer MaSCs were transplanted. When we performed limiting dilution transplant analysis of freshly prepared primary MECs, we obtained a MaSC frequency of approximately 1/13,000 cells (data not shown). We therefore used a 100-fold dilution range and scored the limiting dilution outgrowths based on whether they were intermixed or composed of a dominant fluorescent color (Figures 3I and 3J and Table 2). As we reduced the number of cells transplanted from 200,000 to 2000, we observed a decrease in intermixed outgrowths with a concomitant increase in dominant color outgrowths (Figure 3J and Table 2). The success rate of these limiting dilution transplants was consistent with a MaSC frequency of 1/29,000 cells (range of 1/21,000–1/40,000), approximately half of that observed before the suspension infection. This lower frequency is likely due to culturing in suspension, which eliminates survival signals mediated through basement membrane attachment (Streuli and Gilmore, 1999Streuli C.H. Gilmore A.P. Adhesion-mediated signaling in the regulation of mammary epithelial cell survival.J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1999; 4: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and to cytotoxicity associated with exposure to highly concentrated virus. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that expression of certain fluorescent markers may affect growth of transduced MECs, thereby reducing the apparent MaSC frequency. Consistent with this notion, the majority of dominant color outgrowths were Zsgreen positive (Table 2), which suggests that expression of the H2BmRFP fusion protein may have a negative effect on growth. Transplants derived from 10,000 MECs or less are likely to develop from a single MaSC. Accordingly, 12/14 outgrowths from such transplants were either monochromatic or exhibited a single dominant color (Figure 3I and Table 2). Therefore, the suspension infection method can be used to study the effect of genes in both polyclonal and monoclonal outgrowths by varying the number of MECs transplanted.Table 2Success Rates and Fluorescent Phenotypes of Limiting Dilution Two-Color TransplantsCells TransplantedSuccessful OutgrowthsaNonfluorescent transplants were stained with carmine-alum; only 1 of 121 contained ductal epithelium.Fluorescent OutgrowthsFluorescence PhenotypeIntermixedDominant ColorbOutgrowths with >90% of their ducts composed of a single fluorescent color, the prevalence of which is indicated between brackets (G is green, and R is red).200,00012/121293 (1G, 2R)20,00025/40241311 (11G)10,00011/401129 (7G, 2R)50002/40202 (2R)20001/40101 (1G)a Nonfluorescent transplants were stained with carmine-alum; only 1 of 121 contained ductal epithelium.b Outgrowths with >90% of their ducts composed of a single fluorescent color, the prevalence of which is indicated between brackets (G is green, and R is red). Open table in a new tab Our transduction technique would be most useful if it were a rapid alternative to producing transgenic mice. As a proof of concept, we asked if a lentivirus combined with the suspension infection method could phenocopy a transgenic mouse model of breast cancer. Mice that express Wnt-1 under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (MMTV-Wnt-1) develop mammary hyperplasias that progress to adenocarcinoma with a median onset of 6 months (Tsukamoto et al., 1988Tsukamoto A.S. Grosschedl R. Guzman R.C. Parslow T. Varmus H.E. Expression of the int-1 gene in transgenic mice is associated with mammary gland hyperplasia and adenocarcinomas in male and female mice.Cell. 1988; 55: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). We transduced primary MECs with a lentivirus expressing Wnt-1 (HIV-Wnt-1) and analyzed outgrowths 1, 7, and 10 months after transplantation. By 1 month after transplantation, the HIV-Wnt-1 transplants exhibited increased ductal branching (compare Figure 4B to Figure 4A), as has been observed previously with retroviral Wnt-1 infection (Edwards et al., 1992Edwards P.A. Hiby S.E. Papkoff J. Bradbury J.M. Hyperplasia of mouse mammary epithelium induced by expression of the Wnt-1 (int-1) oncogene in reconstituted mammary gland.Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2041-2051PubMed Google Scholar), and occupied at least twice as much of the fat pad as the contralateral HIV-Zsgreen control outgrowths (Figure 4C). By 7 months after transplantation, the HIV-Wnt-1 outgrowths displayed hyperplasias and adenomas similar to those observed in MMTV-Wnt-1 glands (Tsukamoto et al., 1988Tsukamoto A.S. Grosschedl R. Guzman R.C. Parslow T. Varmus H.E. Expression of the int-1 gene in transgenic mice is associated with mammary gland hyperplasia and adenocarcinomas in male and female mice.Cell. 1988; 55: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) (Figures 4D and 4E). By 10 months, 1 of 16 transplants had a palpable adenocarcinoma (Figure 4F). Thus, we were able to replicate MMTV-Wnt-1 mammary phenotypes in outgrowths from lentiviral-infected MECs. Efficient viral infection of MaSCs is necessary to avoid competition between transduced and untransduced progenitors during outgrowth (Edwards et al., 1996Edwards P.A. Abram C.L. Bradbury J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2098092642,"Rapid progress has recently been made regarding how the niche controls stem cell function, but little is yet known about how stem cells in the same niche interact with one another. In this study, we show that differentiation-defective Drosophila ovarian germline stem cells (GSCs) can outcompete normal ones for niche occupancy in a cadherin-dependent manner. The differentiation-defective bam or bgcn mutant GSCs invade the niche space of neighboring wild-type GSCs and gradually push them out of the niche by upregulating E-cadherin expression. Furthermore, the bam/bgcn-mediated GSC competition requires E-cadherin and normal GSC division, but not the self-renewal-promoting BMP niche signal, while different E-cadherin levels can sufficiently stimulate GSC competition. Therefore, we propose that GSCs have a competitive relationship for niche occupancy, which may serve as a quality control mechanism to ensure that accidentally differentiated stem cells are rapidly removed from the niche and replaced by functional ones."

Overproliferating Lrg-47(-/-) HSCs are severely impaired in functional repopulation assays, and when challenged with hematopoietic ablation by 5-fluorouracil or infection with Mycobacterium avium, Lrg-47(-/-) mice fail to achieve the expected expansion response in stem and progenitor cell populations.

To gain further insights into the mechanisms underlying its development, we investigated the role of Wip1 phosphatase, which is highly expressed in intestinal stem cells, in the mouse model of APCMin-driven polyposis. We found that Wip1 removal increased the life span of APCMin mice through a significant suppression of polyp formation. This protection was dependent on the p53 tumor suppressor, which plays a putative role in the regulation of apoptosis of intestinal stem cells. Activation of apoptosis in stem cells of Wip1-deficient mice, but not wild-type APCMin mice, increased when the Wnt pathway was constitutively activated. We propose, therefore, that the Wip1 phosphatase regulates homeostasis of intestinal stem cells. In turn, Wip1 loss suppresses APCMin-driven polyposis by lowering the threshold for p53-dependent apoptosis of stem cells, thus preventing their conversion into tumor-initiating stem cells.

In turn, Wip1 loss suppresses APCMin-driven polyposis by lowering the threshold for p53-dependent apoptosis of stem cells, thus preventing their conversion into tumor-initiating stem cells. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second largest cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. CRC arises as a result of stepwise genetic alterations in specific oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Mutations in the tumor suppressor adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC) gene, a gatekeeper gene in CRC tumorigenesis, occur early in the development of CRC and lead to the stabilization of β-catenin and constitutive activation of Wnt signaling (Polakis, 1997Polakis P. The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F127-F147PubMed Google Scholar). Much of our current knowledge comes from studies of the hereditary CRC syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). In FAP, individuals develop numerous intestinal adenomas relatively early in life that rapidly progress to carcinomas. In addition, mouse models of CRC continue to make critical contributions to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this multistage disorder. Mice mutant for APC, similar to the defect in FAP patients and in many sporadic cancers, mimic the rapid development of adenomatous polyps that affects humans with germline inactivation of one APC gene (Su et al., 1992Su L.K. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Preisinger A.C. Moser A.R. Luongo C. Gould K.A. Dove W.F. Multiple intestinal neoplasia caused by a mutation in the murine homolog of the APC gene.Science. 1992; 256: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). ApcMin/+ mice have a nonsense mutation at codon 850 in the Apc gene that results in a truncated protein product, and these mice are predisposed to form intestinal tumors. In ApcMin/+ mice, tumors arise as a result of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at Apc as well as through LOH-independent mechanisms (Reitmair et al., 1996Reitmair A.H. Cai J.C. Bjerknes M. Redston M. Cheng H. Pind M.T. Hay K. Mitri A. Bapat B.V. Mak T.W. Gallinger S. MSH2 deficiency contributes to accelerated APC-mediated intestinal tumorigenesis.Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2922-2926PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence supports a role for stem cells in tumorigenesis, including CRC, and several intestinal stem cell markers are highly expressed in APCMin adenomas and carcinomas (O'Brien et al., 2007O'Brien C.A.

In turn, targeting stem cells during their conversion into cancer stem cells represents a powerful yet unexploited cancer-prevention tool. The problem, however, is in detecting intestinal stem cells and thus analyzing their behavior. Self-renewal and organ development assays are not possible with intestinal stem cells; however, their position within the crypt is well defined (Marshman et al., 2002Marshman E. Booth C. Potten C.S. The intestinal epithelial stem cell.Bioessays. 2002; 24: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, Potten and Ellis, 2006Potten C.S. Ellis J.R. Adult small intestinal stem cells: identification, location, characteristics, and clinical applications.Ernst Schering Res. Found. Workshop. 2006; 60: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). There are 4–6 stem cells at the crypt base (positions 4–6) that normally divide once a day, producing a pool of proliferative progenitors that differentiate while moving up the crypt in a continuous wave to be shed after a total lifetime of about 5–7 days (Potten and Ellis, 2006Potten C.S. Ellis J.R. Adult small intestinal stem cells: identification, location, characteristics, and clinical applications.Ernst Schering Res. Found. Workshop. 2006; 60: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). One of the remarkable features of intestinal stem cells is that, despite their large number and rapid rate of cell division, these cells rarely acquire the age-related genetic defects associated with cancer induction or show deterioration in functional competence. This observation suggests that intestinal stem cells have evolved protective mechanisms against genetic damage. Among them is the ability of stem cells to selectively sort the old (parental) and new DNA strands when they divide, retaining only parental DNA strands (Potten et al., 2002Potten C.S. Owen G. Booth D. Intestinal stem cells protect their genome by selective segregation of template DNA strands.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2381-2388PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon is called asymmetric division and ensures that replication-induced errors are excluded from stem cells. Random errors introduced into parental strands (e.g., after exposure to genotoxic agents) trigger a second protective response, robust p53-dependent stem cell apoptosis (Merritt et al., 1994Merritt A.J. Potten C.S. Kemp C.J. Hickman J.A. Balmain A. Lane D.P. Hall P.A. The role of p53 in spontaneous and radiation-induced apoptosis in the gastrointestinal tract of normal and p53-deficient mice.Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 614-617PubMed Google Scholar). Conceivably, alteration of either mechanism could expedite tumorigenesis or, conversely, serve as a powerful cancer-prevention tool. The Wip1 phosphatase is emerging as a potent regulator of tumorigenesis through its ability to attenuate the activity of several stress-induced kinases (Demidov et al., 2007Demidov O.N. Kek C.

In turn, ApcMin/+ mice have been instrumental in colon cancer studies (Corpet and Pierre, 2003Corpet D.E. Pierre F. Point: from animal models to prevention of colon cancer. Systematic review of chemoprevention in min mice and choice of the model system.Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2003; 12: 391-400PubMed Google Scholar); however, the molecular events involved in neoplasia in CRC have only been partially characterized. We therefore chose this in vivo tumor model to analyze the role of Wip1 in the initiation and progression of intestinal cancer. We found that Wip1 phosphatase modulates APCMin-driven polyposis by setting a threshold for p53-dependent apoptosis of stem cells, thus preventing their conversion into tumor-initiating/cancer stem cells. To determine the distribution of Wip1 in the mouse intestine, we analyzed Wip1 mRNA expression using in situ hybridization and found positively stained cells within the crypt base (Figure 1A and see Figure S2 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Analysis of the cell position along the crypt axis indicated that Wip1 mRNA-positive cells were predominantly in position 4 from the crypt base. To further characterize Wip1-expressing cells, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis using a polyclonal antibody to Wip1 (Fujimoto et al., 2006Fujimoto H. Onishi N. Kato N. Takekawa M. Xu X.Z. Kosugi A. Kondo T. Imamura M. Oishi I. Yoda A. Minami Y.

We found the majority of Wip1-positive cells were in position 4, with the long tail to the right (Figure 1A, right panels). Stem/early progenitor cells occupy positions 4–6 in the intestine, whereas Paneth cells occupy the first three positions (Potten et al., 2002Potten C.S. Owen G. Booth D.

Next, we performed dual immunohistochemical staining of Wip1 and phospho-PTEN and found coexpression of these two markers (Figure 1C). As has been established in the field, the approach to analyze adult stem cells is to perform label-retaining experiments using either [3H]thymidine or BrdU (Radtke and Clevers, 2005Radtke F.

In the mouse intestine, label-retaining experiments have been supported by experiments using ionizing radiation (IR), which provides a surrogate repopulation (organ development) test. It has been established that label-retaining cells are the most sensitive cells to IR and that the extent to which these cells are killed by IR is reflected in the intestinal morphology (reviewed in Potten and Ellis, 2006Potten C.S. Ellis J.R. Adult small intestinal stem cells: identification, location, characteristics, and clinical applications.Ernst Schering Res. Found. Workshop. 2006; 60: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the death of label-retaining cells affects crypt survival in the mouse intestine. The above data confirm that label-retaining cells are intestinal stem cells. To rigorously test whether Wip1-positive cells are indeed intestinal stem cells, we next carried out juvenile label-retaining experiments using [3H]thymidine (Potten et al., 2002Potten C.S. Owen G. Booth D. Intestinal stem cells protect their genome by selective segregation of template DNA strands.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2381-2388PubMed Google Scholar). This protocol labels proliferating cells, including stem cells. In the intestine, almost all labeled cells are removed due to continuous flow up the crypt, where they are shed in the intestinal lumen. Two features of stem cells allow them to retain [3H]thymidine. First, stem cells do not migrate but continue to reside in the intestine and, once labeled, are easy to detect. Second, even when they divide, intestinal stem cells retain the labeled parental strands of DNA, thus preventing [3H]thymidine-labeled DNA from being diluted during multiple rounds of division (Potten et al., 2002Potten C.S. Owen G. Booth D. Intestinal stem cells protect their genome by selective segregation of template DNA strands.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2381-2388PubMed Google Scholar). We injected 5- to 6-week-old wild-type mice with 50 μCi [3H]thymidine every 12 hr for 3 days and sacrificed them 3 weeks after the last injection. Consistent with previous reports (Potten et al., 2002Potten C.S. Owen G. Booth D. Intestinal stem cells protect their genome by selective segregation of template DNA strands.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2381-2388PubMed Google Scholar, Potten and Ellis, 2006Potten C.S. Ellis J.R. Adult small intestinal stem cells: identification, location, characteristics, and clinical applications.Ernst Schering Res. Found. Workshop. 2006; 60: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we found [3H]thymidine-retaining cells predominantly in position 4 from the crypt base (Figure 1D). Subsequent costaining for Wip1 revealed that the majority of [3H]thymidine-retaining cells were positive for Wip1 (Figure 1D, right panel), supporting the idea that Wip1 is specifically expressed in intestinal stem cells. It is important to emphasize that our data do not exclude the possibility that Wip1-expressing stem cells could be found in the Paneth cell area. As shown in Figures 1A and 1D, about 40% of cells in the Paneth cell compartment retain [3H]thymidine and express Wip1 mRNA. Thus, our data are compatible with the hypothesis that some intestinal stem cells reside in the Paneth area (Bjerknes and Cheng, 2006Bjerknes M. Cheng H. Intestinal epithelial stem cells and progenitors.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 419: 337-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Expression of Wip1 phosphatase after DNA damage is dependent on the p53 tumor suppressor (Choi et al., 2002Choi J. Nannenga B. Demidov O.N. Bulavin D.V. Cooney A. Brayton C. Zhang Y. Mbawuike I.N. Bradley A. Appella E. Donehower L.A. Mice deficient for the wild-type p53-induced phosphatase gene (Wip1) exhibit defects in reproductive organs, immune function, and cell cycle control.Mol. Cell.

Wip1, a novel human protein phosphatase that is induced in response to ionizing radiation in a p53-dependent manner.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 6048-6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). To investigate whether intestinal Wip1 expression is regulated through p53, we carried out an immunohistochemical analysis of Wip1 in the intestines of p53 null mice. Compared to wild-type mice, Wip1 was present in p53 null intestines at similar levels and in similar cell positions within the crypt base (Figure 1E). Thus, Wip1 expression is regulated in a p53-independent manner in mouse intestinal stem cells. To understand the potential role of Wip1 in regulating intestinal tumorigenesis and in ApcMin/+-driven polyposis in particular, we next carried out real-time PCR analysis of Wip1 mRNA in polyps and compared it with Wip1 mRNA levels in normal intestinal epithelium. Total RNA was purified from intestinal epithelium and microdissected polyps, both obtained from APCMin mice, and used for reverse transcription and subsequent real-time PCR analysis. The level of Wip1 mRNA in polyps was ∼5-fold greater than in intestinal epithelium (Figure 2A). The Wip1 mRNA overexpression in polyps of APCMin mice was further confirmed by in situ RNA hybridization (Figure 2B). It is possible that accumulation of Wip1 in polyps in the course of APCMin-driven polyposis is a consequence of cancer progression rather than a contributing factor. To investigate this possibility, ApcMin/+ mice were crossed with Wip1 null mice, and then we intercrossed Wip1+/− mice carrying the ApcMin/+ allele to yield two genotypes: Wip1+/+ and Wip1−/− mice, all carrying the ApcMin/+ allele. To investigate tumor onset, we used only littermates from the same parents for all crosses. We found that Wip1−/− mice survived longer than wild-type (WT)/ApcMin/+ mice (Figure 2C) and developed only a few polyps by day 120 (Figure 2D, 8 ± 1 polyps per mouse for Wip1 null/ApcMin/+ compared to 67 ± 5 polyps per mouse for WT/ApcMin/+, p < 0.001). Moreover, Wip1 null/ApcMin/+ mice that survived beyond 300 days developed only 18 ± 1 polyps per mouse, which was statistically insignificant from the number of polyps developed by day 120 (8 ± 1 polyps per mouse). Polyp analysis showed that Wip1 null/ApcMin/+ polyps were smaller in size than WT/ApcMin/+ polyps (p = 0.05) and were primarily localized to the small intestine (Figures 2E and 2F). Thus, Wip1 deficiency dramatically suppresses polyp formation in the presence of the ApcMin mutation, supporting the idea that Wip1 is critical in regulating ApcMin-driven polyposis. Activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway is critical for polyp development through Tcf/Lef-dependent gene regulation (Korinek et al., 1997Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Constitutive transcriptional activation by a beta-catenin-Tcf complex in APC−/− colon carcinoma.Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2846) Google Scholar, Morin et al., 1997Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Activation of beta-catenin-Tcf signaling in colon cancer by mutations in beta-catenin or APC.Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). To determine whether β-catenin activation was impaired in Wip1 null mice, immunohistochemical analysis was used to determine its subcellular localization. Although polyps that developed in Wip1 null/ApcMin/+ mice were substantially smaller than in WT/ApcMin/+ mice (Figure 3A, top panels), β-catenin was detected in the nuclei of polyp cells of both genotypes (Figure 3A, bottom panels). This suggests that Wip1 deficiency does not affect nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. Once β-catenin accumulates in the nucleus, it induces the transcription of Tcf/Lef-dependent genes. We observed increased expression of these genes in the intestines of ApcMin/+ mice compared to wild-type mice (Figure 3B). A similar increase in mRNA levels for c-myc, cyclin D1, CD44, and Brachyury was found in Wip1 null/ApcMin/+ compared to Wip1 null intestines, with no apparent difference between WT/ApcMin/+ and wild-type mice, respectively. Thus, deficiency of Wip1 does not affect the β-catenin-Tcf/Lef-dependent signaling pathway. Wip1 null mice show a profound tumor-resistant phenotype in several mouse models of cancer (Bulavin et al., 2004Bulavin D.V. Phillips C. Nannenga B. Timofeev O. Donehower L.A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Fornace Jr., A.J. Inactivation of the Wip1 phosphatase inhibits mammary tumorigenesis through p38 MAPK-mediated activation of the p16(Ink4a)-p19(Arf) pathway.Nat.

To determine how polyp formation is suppressed in Wip1 null/ApcMin/+ mice (Figure 2D), we next analyzed cell proliferation and apoptosis in the intestine. Analysis of cell proliferation based on BrdU incorporation experiments revealed no difference between Wip1 null/ApcMin/+ and WT/ApcMin/+ mice where proliferative cells were restricted to the crypt compartment in both genotypes (Figure 3C). Similar results were obtained with another marker of proliferation, Ki-67 (data not shown). We also observed similar migration of BrdU-pulse-labeled epithelial cells in both WT/ApcMin/+ and Wip1 null/ApcMin/+ mice (data not shown). Analysis of apoptosis using an antibody to the active form of caspase-3 revealed positively stained cells in positions 4–6 from the base of the crypt in Wip1 null/ApcMin/+ mice, while only a few positive cells were observed in WT/ApcMin/+ mice (Figures 4A and 4B). Self-renewal and organ development assays are not possible in the intestine as they are in other organs such as breast, prostate, or the hematopoietic system; however, the spatial organization of intestinal stem cells is well defined and documented (Potten and Ellis, 2006Potten C.S.

Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in development and disease.Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4170) Google Scholar). A series of elegant experiments confirmed that intestinal stem cells are located in positions 4–6 from the base of the crypt, and several markers were characterized in these cells, including phospho-PTEN, Sox4, and Ascl2 (He et al., 2004He X.C. Zhang J. Tong W.G. Tawfik O. Ross J. Scoville D.H. Tian Q. Zeng X. He X.

As we found apoptotic cells in positions 4–6 in Wip1 null mice (Figure 4A and Figure S2), we next carried out double labeling to analyze markers of apoptosis and markers of intestinal stem cells, Sox4 and Ascl2, by RNA in situ hybridization (Figures 4D and 4E and Figure S2). We also used immunohistochemistry to analyze whether TUNEL-positive cells colocalized with another marker of intestinal stem cells, phospho-PTEN (Figure 4C). We found that ∼80% of apoptosis-positive cells showed costaining with either Sox4, Ascl2, or phospho-PTEN. We next counted the number of positive cells for different markers according to their position along the crypt axis, as previously described (Potten et al., 2002Potten C.S. Owen G. Booth D. Intestinal stem cells protect their genome by selective segregation of template DNA strands.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2381-2388PubMed Google Scholar). The cell position frequency plot showed that stem cell markers such as Sox4, Ascl2, and phospho-PTEN, as well as apoptotic cells analyzed in sections from Wip1 null mice, peaked at cell position 4 (Figures 1B, 4A, 4D, and 4E). Similar frequency plots were obtained for stem cell markers in wild-type mice (data not shown). To unambiguously confirm that some intestinal stem cells undergo apoptosis in Wip1 null mice, we carried out a label-retaining experiment using juvenile mice (Potten et al., 2002Potten C.S. Owen G. Booth D. Intestinal stem cells protect their genome by selective segregation of template DNA strands.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2381-2388PubMed Google Scholar). We found that cells undergoing apoptosis also retained [3H]thymidine (Figure 4F). These data strongly support the idea that intestinal stem cells in Wip1 null/ApcMin/+ mice undergo apoptosis. Consistent with the hypothesis that some intestinal stem cells reside in the Paneth area (Bjerknes and Cheng, 2006Bjerknes M. Cheng H. Intestinal epithelial stem cells and progenitors.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 419: 337-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we found that about 40% of cells in the Paneth cell compartment are reactive for the stem cell markers Sox4, Ascl2, and phospho-PTEN, retain [3H]thymidine, and undergo apoptosis in Wip1 null mice (Figure 4). There is a low level of spontaneous apoptosis of intestinal stem cells in APCMin-Wip1 null mice (Figures 4A and 4B). This is different from a massive cell death of intestinal stem cells after IR, which leads to a compensatory increase in the number of proliferative cells in the crypt compartment (Potten et al., 1995Potten C.S. Owen G. Hewitt D. Chadwick C.A. Hendry H. Lord B.I. Woolford L.B. Stimulation and inhibition of proliferation in the small intestinal crypts of the mouse after in vivo administration of growth factors.Gut. 1995; 36: 864-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In turn, the death of a few intestinal stem cells, as in Wip1 null mice (Figures 4A and 4B), is not detrimental to the function of the particular crypt as these cells could be easily replaced with either early proliferative progenitors or another stem cell (discussed below). Thus, it is conceivable to see no compensation in proliferation in the crypt progenitor compartment of Wip1 null intestine (Figure 3C). To further ver"

To identify novel embryonic stem cell (ESC) regulators and assemble transcriptional networks controlling ESC fate, we performed temporal expression microarray analyses of ESCs after the initiation of commitment and integrated these data with known genome-wide transcription factor binding. Effects of forced under- or overexpression of predicted novel regulators, defined as differentially expressed genes with potential binding sites for known regulators of pluripotency, demonstrated greater than 90% correspondence with predicted function, as assessed by functional and high-content assays of self-renewal. We next assembled 43 theoretical transcriptional networks in ESCs, 82% (23 out of 28 tested) of which were supported by analysis of genome-wide expression in Oct4 knockdown cells. By using this integrative approach, we have formulated novel networks describing gene repression of key developmental regulators in undifferentiated ESCs and successfully predicted the outcomes of genetic manipulation of these networks."
https://openalex.org/W1973620761,"Hematopoietic stem cells within the bone marrow exist in a quiescent state. They can differentiate and proliferate in response to hematopoietic stress (e.g., myelosuppression), thereby ensuring a well-regulated supply of mature and immature hematopoietic cells within the circulation. However, little is known about how this stress response is coordinated. Here, we show that plasminogen (Plg), a classical fibrinolytic factor, is a key player in controlling this stress response. Deletion of Plg in mice prevented hematopoietic stem cells from entering the cell cycle and undergoing multilineage differentiation after myelosuppression, leading to the death of the mice. Activation of Plg by administration of tissue-type plasminogen activator promoted matrix metalloproteinase-mediated release of Kit ligand from stromal cells, thereby promoting hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. Thus, activation of the fibrinolytic cascade is a critical step in regulating the hematopoietic stress response."

We show here that ES cells lacking Pax6, a transcription factor long known to be essential for cortical development, generate Mash1-positive RG cells that differentiate in GABAergic neurons. These neurons express high levels of the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR causing their rapid death. Pax6 function was also investigated following transplantation of ES cells in the developing chick telencephalon and in mice lacking both Pax6 and p75NTR. Taken together, our results indicate that reliable predictions can be made with cultured ES cells when used to explore the role of genes impacting early aspects of mammalian neurogenesis. They also provide a novel opportunity to compare the molecular constituents of glutamatergic with those of GABA-ergic neurons and to explore the mechanisms of their generation."

Whereas Drosophila and C. elegans gonads are polarized tubes with the stem cells at the closed end and the differentiating cells developing toward the open end, mammalian testes contain long open tubules with the stem cells at the periphery and the differentiating cells developing toward the lumen. Given the cylindrical symmetry of the interior of the tubules, it has been difficult to decipher the spermatogonial stem cell niche. Now Yoshida et al., 2007Yoshida S. Sukeno M. Nabeshima Y.I. Science. 2007; 317 (Published online September 6, 2007): 1722-1726https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1144885Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar have demonstrated that several generations of daughter cells derived from mouse spermatogonial stem cells are preferentially located in regions of the seminiferous tubules that are adjacent to blood vessels with surrounding interstitial cells. Stem spermatogonia in most mammals are isolated (single) type A spermatogonia (As) (de Rooij and Russell, 2000de Rooij D.G. Russell L.D. J. Androl. 2000; 21: 776-798PubMed Google Scholar). These cells can undergo either a self-renewing division to produce two stem cells, a “steady-state” division to produce one As cell that will remain a stem cell and one As cell that is destined to differentiate, or a differentiating division to produce a pair of A spermatogonia (Apr) joined by an intercellular bridge. These Apr then undergo further divisions to produce aligned spermatogonia (Aal) generally in chains of four and eight. The isolated cells and those in pairs and chains are morphologically indistinguishable and collectively called “undifferentiated” type A spermatogonia (Aundiff). The Aal spermatogonia morphologically transform into A1 spermatogonia, followed by six mitotic divisions to become A2, A3, A4, intermediate, and B spermatogonia, and preleptotene spermatocytes, and then enter meiotic prophase. Spermatogonia are located in the basal region of the seminiferous tubules in direct contact with the Sertoli cells and basement membranes, which separate them from the peritubular myoid cells (Figure 1). Based on their proximity to the spermatogonia, it is likely that one of these cells is involved in the niche that regulates the balance between spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal and production of differentiating progeny. However, the Sertoli and myoid cells appear uniformly distributed around the circumference and length of the seminiferous tubules and have not been demonstrated to display heterogeneity that would endow them with function as a niche for the As cells, which occur at a frequency of 1 per 100 Sertoli cells (Tegelenbosch and de Rooij, 1993Tegelenbosch R.A. de Rooij D.G. Mutat. Res. 1993; 290: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The only observable asymmetry around the tubules is the position of the vasculature and the bulk of the interstitial cells, consisting primarily of Leydig cells and macrophages that surround the vasculature. In general, these vascular/interstitial structures are located in the triangular space between three closely opposed tubules (Figure 1). Previously, Chiarini-Garcia and colleagues had shown using high-resolution, thin-section light microscopy that Aundiff spermatogonia were preferentially localized to tubular regions adjacent to interstitium and vasculature as opposed to regions adjacent to neighboring tubules (Chiarini-Garcia et al., 2001Chiarini-Garcia H.

The images beautifully show Apr spermatogonia, adjacent to the vascular/interstitium complexes, expanding to chains of Aal-8. Subsequently, these cells migrate to other areas under the tubular surface and divide into 16 cell chains, corresponding to the A1-to-A2 spermatogonial division, and then become uniformly distributed throughout the basal region of the seminiferous tubule. The Neurog3 promoter produces GFP expression in most of the Aundiff spermatogonia (Yoshida et al., 2004Yoshida S. Takakura A. Ohbo K. Abe K. Wakabayashi J. Yamamoto M. Suda T. Nabeshima Y. Dev.

Cell. 2007; 12: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) indicates that the As spermatogonia with a high probability of steady-state self-renewal have low expression levels of Neurog3. This suggests that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which is produced by the Sertoli cell and stimulates spermatogonial self-renewal (Meng et al., 2000Meng X. Lindahl M. Hyvonen M.E. Parvinen M. de Rooij D.G. Hess M.W. Raatikainen-Ahokas A. Sainio K. Rauvala H. Lakso M. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 1489-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) and suppresses Neurog3 expression in cultured type A spermatogonia (Oatley et al., 2006Oatley J.M. Avarbock M.R. Telaranta A.I. Fearon D.T. Brinster R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 9524-9529Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), may be responsible for the in vivo observations in Neurog3-Cre mice (T. Shinohara and D.G. de Rooij, personal communication). Thus, most of the GFP-positive Aundiff spermatogonia that were imaged were likely those that had entered the differentiation process. Further analysis showed that, in the stages of tubules when the Aundiff are primarily Aal, there was a >4-fold enrichment of GFP-positive spermatogonia in regions of the tubule close to surrounding vascular/interstitial complexes. To examine the redevelopment of the niche after perturbation, the authors analyzed the positions of Aundiff spermatogonia in isolated transplanted tubules from a donor mouse. The Aundiff spermatogonia in the donor tubules were preferentially localized to the vascular/interstitial zones of host tissue that freshly developed outside the tubules, suggesting a redistribution of stem cell niches in the transplanted tubules. Thus, unlike the fixed, developmentally dependent germline niches in Drosophila or C. elegans, this novel finding shows that new spermatogonial niches can be established in mammals following tissue damage, which is beneficial for maintenance of spermatogenesis during their long reproductive lifetimes. The vascular/interstitial-associated niche is occupied by Aundiff spermatogonia, and the authors are careful not to claim that this is the niche for the As stem cells, which are a small subpopulation of the Aundiff spermatogonia. In fact, the vascular/interstitial localization of the Aundiff spermatogonia was demonstrated only in stages in which a large majority of the cells are Aal. It is possible that the stem cells are found in the basal region of the tubule not associated with the vascular/interstitial bands, and when they divide into two As cells, the daughter cell that is distant from the vasculature most likely remains a stem cell, while the one closer to the vasculature may be stimulated to form Apr spermatogonia at its next division and begin expression of Neurog3-GFP. Thus, daughter cell location may determine the probability of differentiation but probably not in an absolute manner, as does dissociation from the hub in Drosophila. This “vasculature-associated” stem cell niche for spermatogonia differs from the vascular niche described for other systems in which stem or progenitor cells are closely associated with the vascular cells (Nikolova et al., 2007Nikolova G. Strilic B. Lammert E. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 19-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The spermatogonia, in contrast, are separated from the vasculature by interstitial Leydig cells, peritubular myoid cells, and the layers of basement membrane to which the spermatogonia attach. The role of the vasculature appears to be indirect, since the Aundiff spermatogonia are associated only with the vessels that have surrounding interstitial cells (Yoshida et al., 2007Yoshida S. Sukeno M. Nabeshima Y.I. Science. 2007; 317 (Published online September 6, 2007): 1722-1726https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1144885Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The future challenge remains to determine the interstitial cell-derived factors that determine the spermatogonial niche and the pathway by which they create the appropriate microenvironments for steady-state self-renewal and differentiation. The peritubular myoid and/or Sertoli cells may produce secondary factors that directly regulate spermatogonial behavior. Studies should be focused on determining whether asymmetric distributions of these factors occur, creating different microenvironments within the basal region of the tubule to determine the regions for stem cell renewal and differentiation."

Many key questions in stem cell biology revolve around the origin, tissue home, and physiological role of the adult stem cell populations that have been identified over the past several decades. For some, such as hematopoietic and epidermal stem cells, their niches and biological roles are relatively clear. For others, such as adult neural stem cells, we are just beginning to understand their importance in the adult organism. And for yet others, we still know little. Among this latter group are mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which, while intensively studied in culture, have remained elusive with regard to their in vivo biology. In this regard, a recent paper in Cell by Takashima et al., 2007Takashima Y. Era T. Nakao K. Kondo S. Kasuga M. Smith A.G. Nishikawa S.I. Cell. 2007; 129: 1377-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar has addressed the in vivo biology of MSCs, with some surprising and unexpected conclusions. MSCs were originally defined by two properties they display when cultured: the ability to proliferate substantially as clones and to differentiate into mesenchymal lineages, including osteocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes (Prockop, 1997Prockop D.J. Science. 1997; 276: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (4013) Google Scholar). Subsequent work defined markers that enabled the prospective isolation, enrichment, and characterization of MSCs (Gronthos et al., 1994Gronthos S. Graves S.E. Ohta S. Simmons P.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 4164-4173PubMed Google Scholar, Pittenger et al., 1999Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (17004) Google Scholar) and ultimately demonstrated their utility for a number of cell-replacement applications (Deans and Moseley, 2000Deans R.J. Moseley A.B. Exp. Hematol. 2000; 2: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, Horwitz et al., 2002Horwitz E.M. Gordon P.L. Koo W.K. Marx J.C. Neel M.C. McNall R.Y. Muul L. Hofmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 8932-8937Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). However, we still know little about their in vivo biology. For example, what is the niche(s) for MSCs in adult tissues? What role do MSCs play in tissue turnover and/or in response to injury? Where do MSCs come from? It is this final question that is the subject of the paper by Takashima et al., 2007Takashima Y. Era T. Nakao K. Kondo S. Kasuga M. Smith A.G. Nishikawa S.I. Cell. 2007; 129: 1377-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar. Mesenchymal tissues such as the skeleton and dermis are known to derive from two developmental origins—mesoderm for most of the body, and cranial neural crest for the face, front of the skull, and some upper-trunk structures. It has therefore been assumed, but never shown, that MSCs largely derive from mesoderm (Dennis and Charbord, 2002Dennis J.E. Charbord P. Stem Cells. 2002; 20: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Takashima et al., 2007Takashima Y. Era T. Nakao K. Kondo S. Kasuga M. Smith A.G. Nishikawa S.I. Cell. 2007; 129: 1377-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar therefore chose to ask how MSCs arise, initially by studying ES cells. Using protocols that differentiate ES cells to mesodermal versus neural/neural crest lineages, they demonstrated that both lineages generated PDGFRα-positive cells (a marker for MSCs) that could make adipocytes. However, the surprise came when they found that the neural, but not mesodermal, differentiations contained MSCs that could proliferate extensively as multipotent clones. Moreover, these MSCs were generated from cells expressing Sox1, a definitive marker for neuroepithelium, demonstrating their neural origin. Thus, for ES cells, differentiation along a mesodermal pathway did not generate MSCs, but differentiation toward a neural/neural crest fate did. These results were surprising from two perspectives. First, they suggested that MSCs might primarily originate from the neuroepithelium in vivo. Second, they implied that mesodermal differentiation into mesenchymal cell types did not necessarily require an MSC intermediate. Takashima et al., 2007Takashima Y. Era T. Nakao K. Kondo S. Kasuga M. Smith A.G. Nishikawa S.I. Cell. 2007; 129: 1377-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar then asked about the in vivo relevance of these findings by using lineage tracing approaches. They first made embryos expressing GFP from the Sox1 locus. They then isolated the trunk of these embryos at E9.5 (thereby excluding the cranial neural crest, which is known to generate mesenchymal cells) and demonstrated that Sox1-GFP-positive cells gave rise to PDGFRα-positive MSCs. In contrast, GFP-negative, PDGFRα-positive cells (which expressed mesodermal markers) did not generate MSCs, although they did make adipocytes. Thus, just as seen with ES cells, MSCs could be generated from trunk neuroepithelial cells, but not from mesodermal cells in midgestation embryos. These experiments demonstrated that trunk neuroepithelium could make MSCs. To demonstrate that it actually did so, the authors made Sox1-Cre/YFP mice in which the progeny of Sox1-positive neuroepithelial cells were persistently labeled. They also used P0-Cre/YFP mice (P0 is a neural crest marker) in which the progeny of P0-positive neural crest stem cells were persistently labeled. Analysis of these mice demonstrated that a large portion of PDGFRα-positive cells in the E14.5 trunk were in fact neuroepithelium and/or neural crest-derived and that a subpopulation of these were MSCs. However, while pursuing these experiments, the authors made a second unexpected finding: many fewer (8-fold) PDGFRα-positive cells came from the neuroepithelium than from the neural crest. Trunk neural crest is thought to be entirely neuroepithelium derived, but this observation raises the intriguing possibility that this particular subpopulation of neural crest has a different origin. Finally, Takashima et al., 2007Takashima Y. Era T. Nakao K. Kondo S. Kasuga M. Smith A.G. Nishikawa S.I. Cell. 2007; 129: 1377-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar asked what contribution these neural-derived MSCs made to the postnatal bone marrow, the most-well-characterized MSC source. They showed that neural MSCs were still present in the bone marrow but that their numbers declined so that they represented only a very small fraction of PDGFRα-positive bone cells by adulthood. Thus, by inference, the relative importance of the neuroepithelium/neural crest-derived MSCs declined over development, with a later wave of MSCs becoming increasingly important. These studies therefore support the surprising overall conclusion that the first wave of MSCs in the embryo derive from the neuroepithelium and neural crest, including the trunk neural crest, and that a second wave of MSCs from an unknown source then takes precedence following birth. These findings also define a stem cell hierarchy, in which neuroepithelial stem cells give rise to neural crest stem cells that in turn are the parents of MSCs. However, perhaps as important as the conclusions are the questions raised by this study. First, what is the other, later source(s) of MSCs? Mesoderm immediately comes to mind, but data presented here argue that mesoderm can generate mesenchymal cell types without transiting through an MSC intermediate. Moreover, recent work has suggested that hematopoietic stem cells can generate MSCs (Ogawa et al., 2006Ogawa M. LaRue A.C. Drake C.J. Blood. 2006; 108: 2893-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, the origin of most adult MSCs is still an open question. Second, do MSCs of different developmental origins differ in either their properties or biological roles? For example, perhaps neural crest-derived MSCs are important for genesis of embryonic tissues, while mesodermally derived MSCs are important for tissue maintenance and repair. Third, do the stem cell hierarchies defined in the embryo still exist in adult tissues, and if so, are they one-way hierarchies? For example, perhaps adult neural crest stem cells that persist in mesenchymal tissues (Fernandes et al., 2004Fernandes K.J. McKenzie I.A. Mill P. Smith K.M. Skhavan M. Barnabe-Heider F. Biernaskie J. Junek A. Kobayashi N.R. Toma J.G. et al.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1082-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) are the parents of some adult MSCs. Moreover, if MSCs could dedifferentiate to resemble their neural crest stem cell parents, then perhaps this would explain some of the unexpected potency of bone marrow-derived MSCs (Jiang et al., 2002Jiang Y. Jahagirdar B.N. Reinhardt R.L. Schwartz R.E. Keene C.D. Ortiz-Gonzalez X.R. Reyes M. Lenvik T. Lund T. Blackstad M. et al.Nature. 2002; 418: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (4983) Google Scholar). Answering these questions promises both to generate fundamental information about MSCs and to provide insights into the biology of adult stem cells in general. Neuroepithelial Cells Supply an Initial Transient Wave of MSC DifferentiationTakashima et al.CellJune 29, 2007In BriefMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are defined as cells that undergo sustained in vitro growth and are able to give rise to multiple mesenchymal lineages. Although MSCs are already used in regenerative medicine little is known about their in vivo behavior and developmental derivation. Here, we show that the earliest wave of MSC in the embryonic trunk is generated from Sox1+ neuroepithelium but not from mesoderm. Using lineage marking by direct gfp knock-in and Cre-recombinase mediated lineage tracing, we provide evidence that Sox1+ neuroepithelium gives rise to MSCs in part through a neural crest intermediate stage.

After attempting to rule out fusion of donor tissue with pre-existing host circuitry, the authors report robust long-distance donor axonal projections and synaptic integration into target regions appropriate for the motor system. It is an intricate journey from the developing neuroectoderm—populated by uncommitted multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs)—to the highly specific synaptic contacts that, for example, precisely move one's finger. As development of the central nervous system (CNS) proceeds, the neural tube generates billions of neurons that are interconnected through axons, establishing trillions of synapses. In this highly complex and tightly controlled network, one neuron can establish >10,000 synapses with another neuron. It seems daunting to think that a cellular suspension of exogenous NSCs transplanted into a damaged cortex of an adult brain should be able to recapitulate such precision and complexity. And, in general, it has been quite difficult to achieve. Even under conditions where functional recovery has been observed after the implantation of stem cells into the lesioned CNS, the underlying mechanism has often turned out to be not primarily neuronal replacement but rather the stem cell-mediated protection of pre-existing neuronal networks. This phenomenon, called the “chaperone effect” (Ourednik et al., 2002Ourednik J. Ourednik V. Lynch W.P. Schachner M. Snyder E.Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1103-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), has actually come to be viewed as “low-hanging fruit” in the stem cell field for many types of abnormalities in many organ systems (e.g., heart, muscle, pancreas, bone, in addition to CNS). Nevertheless, neuronal replacement remains the Holy Grail of regenerative medicine, although we have all come to recognize how challenging that is. A recent paper by Gaillard et al., 2007Gaillard A. Prestoz L. Dumartin B. Cantereau A. Morel F. Roger M. Jaber M. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; (in press. Published online September 2, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar offers some hope that we may need not abandon that lofty goal and provides some insights into what we might need to achieve as preconditions for replacement of neural circuitry. Endogenous and grafted neural stem/progenitor cells do have the ability to generate projection neurons in the neocortex (Snyder et al., 1997Snyder E.Y. Yoon C. Flax J.D. Macklis J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 11663-11668Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, Park et al., 2002Park K.I. Teng Y.D. Snyder E.Y. Nat.

Neurosci. 2007; 8: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar)—however, with low efficiency. Prevailing thought holds that this low incidence of neuronal replacement is rooted in the realization that NSCs in a cellular suspension, removed from their instructive and contextual cues, do not efficiently acquire an identity with sufficient refinement to become neurons that “know” to restore discrete and specialized connections. Gaillard et al., 2007Gaillard A. Prestoz L. Dumartin B. Cantereau A. Morel F. Roger M. Jaber M. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; (in press. Published online September 2, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, however, demonstrate that, if we retain (or, presumably, provide) those contextual cues, as one does with a fetal cortical organotypic explant, one can achieve fairly robust neuronal connectivity in a complex system. The authors used a straightforward approach. They aspirated the motor cortex of 4- to 6-month-old male mice and immediately grafted into the lesion cavity embryonic motor cortex explanted from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing female mice. Animals analyzed at 2 months postgrafting showed exuberant long-distance axonal projections and anatomical restoration. Large numbers of GFP-expressing axons were found in the appropriate cortical and subcortical target areas of the motor pathway bilaterally. (Functional recovery was, unfortunately, not studied.) To verify de novo extension of myelinated efferents and synaptogenesis, and to rule out fusion with host cells as an alternative mechanism, a series of experiments were performed, including axonal tracing, immunogold electron microscopy, immunostaining for developmental markers at early postgrafting stages, and FISH to rule out the colocalization of GFP (a donor cell marker) in a Y chromosome-bearing cell (indicative of host derivation). Importantly, embryonic visual cortex grafted into the same lesion cavity did not result in motor pathway-specific projections. Instead, those grafts elaborated axons to brain regions in the visual pathway, suggesting that there are limits to plasticity, not dissimilar from the older fetal transplant literature that showed that heterotopic cortical transplants prior to a critical stage adopted features of the host region but retained the phenotype of their origin if grafted after that critical point (McConnell, 1988McConnell S.K. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 945-974PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, timing and priming are key. Why did the authors observe such axonal projections in a surprisingly short period of time? This result, if replicated and validated, would likely be attributable not only to factors in the graft—cells obtained at the proper developmental stage from the proper region maintaining their proper contextual cues—but also to factors in the host. Transplants were performed immediately after lesioning. Although the authors did not compare results from this procedure with those from delayed grafting, such an acute intervention presumably capitalized on a favorable recipient milieu: minimal postinjury inflammation, excitotoxicity, and scarring; the transient recapitulation of embryonic neurogenic cues (Snyder et al., 1997Snyder E.Y. Yoon C. Flax J.D. Macklis J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 11663-11668Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar); and abundant neurotrophic support and residual guidance cues. New axons may readily have taken over recently vacated synaptic fields of the lesioned motor pathway that otherwise, if time had been allowed to pass, might have received aberrant axonal sprouting from neighboring systems (Hofstetter et al., 2005Hofstetter C.P. Holmstrom N.A. Lilja J.A. Schweinhardt P. Hao J. Spenger C. Wiesenfeld-Hallin Z. Kurpad S.N. Frisen J. Olson L. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Hence, timing of transplantation is probably a critical factor for motor pathway restoration. When therapy is delayed, formation of large cysts often complicates some brain injuries. Seeding cells upon implantable biodegradable scaffolds might address this problem by recreating the three-dimensional context Park et al., 2002Park K.I. Teng Y.D. Snyder E.Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar found so vital (Gaillard et al., 2007Gaillard A. Prestoz L. Dumartin B. Cantereau A. Morel F. Roger M. Jaber M. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; (in press. Published online September 2, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The limitation, of course, would be the impediments to reconstruction raised by the host over time, ranging from scarring to developmentally timed obstacles. During development, axons find their way correctly by responding to a precisely regulated balance between chemoattractive and chemorepellent microenvironmental cues. In adulthood, most brain regions are nonpermissive of axonal plasticity and sprouting. Once synaptic vacancies are occupied by ingrowing axons, these areas are often no longer accessible. Inhibitory molecules (e.g., Nogo-A, MAG) on adult CNS myelin suppress axonal growth (Buchli and Schwab, 2005Buchli A.D. Schwab M.E. Ann. Med. 2005; 37: 556-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Given these obstacles, why did so many axons, as reported by Gaillard et al., 2007Gaillard A. Prestoz L. Dumartin B. Cantereau A. Morel F. Roger M. Jaber M. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; (in press. Published online September 2, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, grow in a presumably nonpermissive environment? The authors do not address this point. It might be that embryonic cortical motor neurons are special in some way in being less susceptible to inhibition; however, visual cortical grafts also grew—albeit to different targets. Systems may differ in their receptiveness for repair. For example, in the nigrostriatal system, projections to the striatum from fetal dopamine neurons grafted into the young adult rat midbrain are poor (Bentlage et al., 1999Bentlage C. Nikkhah G. Cunningham M.G. Bjorklund A. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 159: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The lesson is not to overgeneralize from one system or cell type to another. We have learned over the past two decades that there is greater plasticity in the normal and injured adult CNS than previously anticipated, regulated at multiple levels: molecular, cellular, synaptic, and behavioral. From studies like that of Gaillard et al., 2007Gaillard A. Prestoz L. Dumartin B. Cantereau A. Morel F. Roger M. Jaber M. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; (in press. Published online September 2, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, we learn that, if we could expose stem cells to the proper array of signals, then such regeneration might come under our control. Discerning those signals, it seems, is worth the effort. We wish to dedicate this article to our colleague Peter S.

Although human and mouse embryonic stem cells share many characteristics, their behaviors are not identical. Two recent papers describe the derivation of stem cell lines from mouse epiblast that may provide an explanation for the unique character of human embryonic stem cells. The capacity of embryonic stem cells to self-renew indefinitely while maintaining their potential to differentiate into any cell in the embryo has been a valuable tool for mouse geneticists for decades (Bradley et al., 1984Bradley A. Evans M. Kaufman M.H. Robertson E. Nature. 1984; 309: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). The subsequent derivation of these cells in primates (Thomson et al., 1998Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Science. 1998; 282 (Erratum: (1998). Science 282, 1827): 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11509) Google Scholar) has revolutionized the way we think about both transplantation medicine and drug discovery. However, despite the time that has passed since embryonic stem cells were first derived, many questions concerning the nature of these cells persist. What counterpart, if any, do these cells have within the embryo in vivo? What is the explanation for the differences in behavior between mouse embryonic stem cells and their human counterparts? Why has it been so difficult to derive embryonic stem cell lines from other species of animals, despite the clear benefits that the application of such cells would bring? Two recent papers published in the journal Nature, one from the McKay lab (Tesar et al., 2007Tesar P.J. Chenoweth J.G. Brook F.A. Davies T.J. Evans E.P. Mack D.L. Gardner R.L. McKay R.D. Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar) and the other by Vallier and colleagues (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Howlett S.K. Clarkson A. Ahrlund-Richter L. Pedersen R.A. Vallier L. Nature. 2007; 448: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar), shed light on these interesting questions. In both reports, the authors describe the derivation of self-renewing, pluripotent populations of cells from the epiblast of postimplantation mouse embryos, a later developmental stage than the blastocysts used previously. These cells are similar to other mouse embryonic stem cell lines in that they can form embryoid bodies in culture and teratomas in nude mice, and within these masses, differentiated cells from each of the three embryonic germ layers are generated. However, these “epiblast stem cells,” as the authors dubbed them, seem to be distinct from mouse embryonic stem cells derived from blastocyst stage embryos in several ways. Of particular note, many of the altered traits observed in epiblast stem cells are consistent with the salient characteristics of human embryonic stem cells. These new pluripotent mouse cell lines appear to have gene expression patterns distinct from blastocyst-derived embryonic stem cells; require Activin, rather than LIF signaling for self-renewal; and grow in tight epithelial structures reminiscent of human embryonic stem cells. Because of their derivation from postimplantation epiblast, and as Activin/Nodal signaling is important for maintenance of both the mouse epiblast in vivo (Camus et al., 2006Camus A. Perea-Gomez A. Moreau A. Collignon J. Dev. Biol. 2006; 295: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and human embryonic stem cells in vitro (James et al., 2005James D. Levine A.J. Besser D. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development. 2005; 132: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate, as the authors do, that the derivation of these new mouse stem cell lines indicates that human embryonic stem cells might represent a short circuiting of human epiblast development and the capture of an in vitro counterpart to these cells. Consistent with this notion, when the authors transplanted these cells into preimplantation blastocysts they possessed very limited or no ability to contribute to the resulting embryo. Thus far, most mammalian species have been refractory to the derivation of embryonic stem cell lines of the type cultured from mouse blastocysts. In their study, Brons and colleagues also demonstrate that these epiblast stem cells can be derived from rat embryos, a model organism from which there have been numerous but unsuccessful attempts to derive embryonic stem cell lines. The generation of these similar cell lines from mouse, human, and rat suggests that encouraging the self-renewal of epiblast cells may be a more applicable Rosetta stone for translating the derivation of pluripotent stem cells into other species. However, if these cells cannot be forced to contribute in a meaningful way to chimeric offspring, as the authors found for their mouse epiblast stem cells, the utility of the orthologous cells will be greatly limited. Although these studies are significant, they leave several questions unaddressed and ripe for further investigation. In their studies, Tesar and Brons were only able to isolate these cells from postimplantation embryos and not blastocyst stage embryos. This would be consistent with an epiblast origin and nature for these cells. However, why then can primate and human embryonic stem cells be derived from blastocyst stage embryos and why do primate, but not murine, blastocyst-derived cells have similar characteristics to their postimplantation-derived mouse counterparts? Is it that cells within the inner cell mass of human blastocysts are beginning to adopt epiblast characteristics and it is these cells that become human embryonic stem cells? If so, would prolonging the in vitro culture of human blastocysts prior to derivation increase the efficiency of human embryonic stem cell derivation? Furthermore, would these later cell lines have the same characteristics found in existing human embryonic stem cell lines? A perhaps more perplexing question is, if these new mouse stem cell lines and human embryonic stem cells represent a self-renewing population of definitive embryonic epiblast cells, why then do both of these populations retain the capacity to differentiate into extraembryonic trophectoderm and primitive endoderm? Lineage tracing experiments in mice would suggest that the epiblast has extremely limited capacity, if any, to differentiate into these cells types (Gardner and Rossant, 1979Gardner R.L. Rossant J. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1979; 52: 141-152PubMed Google Scholar, Lawson et al., 1991Lawson K.A. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Development. 1991; 113: 891-911PubMed Google Scholar), while the cultured epiblast stem cell lines seem to adopt these cell fates readily. Could it be that without the constraints of their in vivo environment this wider developmental potential for epiblast cells is revealed? Does prolonged in vitro culture somehow lead to an expansion of developmental potential, or is there some other explanation for the remarkable potential of both these epiblast-derived mouse cells and human embryonic stem cells? Regardless of the answers to these questions, the work of Brons and Tesar and their colleagues has provided exciting new information concerning the nature and origins of both mouse and human embryonic stem cells, suggesting a potential explanation for their distinct biology."

(2007) has implicated the eicosanoid prostaglandin E2 in enhancement of hematopoietic stem cell function in zebrafish and in mice. This work may have practical therapeutic value, but much remains to be determined before this possibility is realized."
