https://openalex.org/W2014495927,"RNA and DNA expression vectors containing genes for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, luciferase, and beta-galactosidase were separately injected into mouse skeletal muscle in vivo. Protein expression was readily detected in all cases, and no special delivery system was required for these effects. The extent of expression from both the RNA and DNA constructs was comparable to that obtained from fibroblasts transfected in vitro under optimal conditions. In situ cytochemical staining for beta-galactosidase activity was localized to muscle cells following injection of the beta-galactosidase DNA vector. After injection of the DNA luciferase expression vector, luciferase activity was present in the muscle for at least 2 months."
https://openalex.org/W2071691905,"The beta-amyloid protein (beta/A4), derived from a larger amyloid precursor protein (APP), is the principal component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease. APP is an integral membrane glycoprotein and is secreted as a carboxyl-terminal truncated molecule. APP cleavage, which is a membrane-associated event, occurred at a site located within the beta/A4 region. This suggests that an intact amyloidogenic beta/A4 fragment is not generated during normal APP catabolism. Therefore, an early event in amyloid formation may involve altered APP processing that results in the release and subsequent deposition of intact beta/A4."

HBV envelope transgenic mice were used to show that HBV-encoded antigens are expressed at the hepatocyte surface in a form recognizable by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for a dominant T cell epitope within the major envelope polypeptide and by envelope-specific antibodies. Both interactions led to the death of the hepatocyte in vivo, providing direct evidence that hepatocellular injury in human HBV infection may also be immunologically mediated."

https://openalex.org/W1991143203,"We describe elect rophysiological properties of the O-2A glial progenitor cell in a new serum-free culture system. O-2A progenitors have many properties characteristic of neurons: they have glutamate-activated ion channels, express the neuronal form of the sodium channel, fire single regenerative potentials, and synthesize the neurotransmitter GABA by an alternative synthetic pathway. Nearly identical properties were observed in acutely isolated O-2A progenitors, indicating that this phenotype is not an artifact of culture. The O-2A did not express a simple subset of channel types found in its descendant cells, the type-2 astrocyte and oligodendrocyte, studied in the same culture system. During development, these electrophysiological properties may contribute to O-2A function in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1512861794,"Affinity labeling and immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) is the major serum-binding protein for transforming growth factors beta 1 and beta 2 (TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2). Purified alpha 2M inhibits the binding of both 125I-TGF-beta 1 and 125I-TGF-beta 2 to cell surface receptors at I50 values of 200 and 10 micrograms/ml, respectively. alpha 2M (200 micrograms/ml) does not block TGF-beta 1 inhibition of CCL-64 mink lung cell growth but reduces this activity of TGF-beta 2 10-fold. The electrophoretic migration of 125I-TGF-beta.alpha 2M complexes on polyacrylamide gels under nondenaturing conditions demonstrates that alpha 2M has 10-fold greater affinity for TGF-beta 2 than for TGF-beta 1. Each of these complexes comigrates as a single band with the fast form of alpha 2M. We suggest that alpha 2M is an important differential regulator of the biological activities of TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1560804531,"Incubation of mouse thymocytes with adenosine and its receptor site agonist, 2-chloroadenosine, induced a pronounced increase in the intracellular cAMP level and resulted in internucleosomal DNA fragmentation followed by cell lysis. Similar DNA fragmentation was induced in peripheral T-lymphocytes prepared from spleen cells but to a lesser extent than in the thymocytes. The DNA fragmentation in both thymocytes and splenic T-lymphocytes was prevented by the addition of actinomycin D and cycloheximide, indicating that this process required mRNA and protein synthesis. The inhibition was accompanied by a reduction in cell lysis as judged by the release of lactate dehydrogenase into the medium. Involvement of cAMP accumulation in inducing DNA fragmentation was supported by the results of experiments with cAMP analogs such as dibutyryl cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP, and cAMP level-raising drugs including forskolin, cholera toxin, and isobutylmethyxanthine. The latter agents induced pronounced or sustained elevation of cellular cAMP followed by internucleosomal DNA cleavage in T-lymphocytes. These results suggest that adenosine receptor-mediated accumulation of cyclic AMP regulates T-lymphocyte death through inducement of internucleosomal DNA cleavage."

https://openalex.org/W2075905993,"A cell line has been established in continuous culture of human cerebral cortical neurons obtained from a patient with unilateral megalencephaly, a disorder associated with continued proliferation of immature neuronal cells. When differentiated in the presence of nerve growth factor, 1-isobutyl-3-methylxanthine, and dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), the cells display mature neuronal morphology with numerous long, extensively branched processes with spines and varicosities. The cells stain positively for neurofilament protein and neuron-specific enolase (selective neuronal markers) but are negative for glial markers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein, S-100, and myelin basic protein. The cells also stain positively for the neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, somatostatin, cholecystokinin-8, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. These cells may facilitate characterization of neurons in the human central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2015954719,"We have used permeable cells of Trypanosoma brucei to analyze the role of snRNAs in the trans splicing process. Degradation of U2, U4, or U6 snRNA by site-directed cleavage with complementary deoxyoligonucleotides and RNAase H inhibits trans splicing of the spliced leader (SL) RNA and newly synthesized alpha-tubulin pre-mRNAs. Cleavage of U snRNAs abolishes the appearance of putative trans splicing reaction intermediates and products, namely, linear branched molecules consisting of the SL intron joined to high molecular weight RNA (Y structures) and free SL intron. This indicates that U snRNAs are required for an early step in trans splicing. alpha-tubulin transcripts synthesized in the absence of trans splicing are unstable, suggesting that the addition of the SL sequence stabilizes pre-mRNAs against degradation. Our results provide direct evidence for the participation of U2 and U4/U6 snRNPs in trans splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1500649719,"Glucocorticoid receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that are subject to down-regulation by their cognate ligand; however, the mechanisms mediating this physiological response are not completely understood. Since analysis of the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) cDNA sequence revealed the presence of sequences with homology to both positive and negative glucocorticoid regulatory elements, we have examined the potential of hGR to bind to the hGR cDNA by Southwestern blot analysis. The data revealed that glucocorticoid receptors exhibited specific binding to their own cDNA. To determine whether this binding was of functional significance in the down-regulation of glucocorticoid receptors, we analyzed the effect of glucocorticoids on hGR protein levels from COS 1 cells transfected with an hGR cDNA expression vector. These transfected cells produced intact hGR that were capable of ligand-dependent regulation of a co-transfected glucocorticoid-responsive reporter gene. Glucocorticoid treatment of hGR-transfected cells resulted in down-regulation of hGR (assayed by both glucocorticoid binding capacity and hGR protein levels) within 24 h of steroid administration. To determine if the glucocorticoid-induced down-regulation of transfected hGR was compatible with effects at the levels of receptor gene expression and RNA stability, we examined hGR mRNA steady state levels. Reductions from 2- to 6-fold were observed in hGR mRNA levels following glucocorticoid treatment of transfected COS 1 cells. This down-regulation of transfected hGR mRNA could not be attributed to either the Rous sarcoma virus promoter, which drives hGR expression, or to other sequences present in the vector plasmid since transcription of a related plasmid containing a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in place of the hGR cDNA was not regulated by glucocorticoids. Down-regulation of hGR mRNA by glucocorticoids in transfected cells occurred in a time- and dose-dependent manner that is consistent with a glucocorticoid receptor-mediated process. Glucocorticoid-induced down-regulation of hGR mRNa steady state levels was not observed in COS 1 cells transfected with cDNAs encoding mutant hGR (defective in either steroid or DNA binding), which indicates that functional steroid and DNA binding domains of the expressed hGR were required for down-regulation. Interestingly, treatment of transfected COS 1 cells with the glucocorticoid antagonist RU486 also resulted in down-regulation of transfected hGR mRNA. Deletion analysis revealed that the region of the hGR cDNA that was responsible in part for the observed down-regulation in response to glucocorticoid was contained within a 1-kilobase restriction fragment (from base pair +527 to +1526).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2082248591,"Differentiation of adipocytes is accompanied by secretion of molecules stimulating angiogenesis in vivo and endothelial cell growth and motility in vitro. We demonstrate that the angiogenic and motility-stimulating activities secreted by adipocytes are separable from the endothelial cell mitogenic activity by fractionation of adipocyte-conditioned medium. The major differentiation-dependent angiogenic molecule was purified and identified by GCMS as 1-butyryl-glycerol (monobutyrin). Monobutyrin levels increase at least 200-fold during adipocyte differentiation and represent a major fraction of the total angiogenic activity. Synthetic monobutyrin shows the same spectrum of biological activities as the adipocyte-derived factor: stimulation of angiogenesis in vivo and microvascular endothelial cell motility in vitro, with no effect on endothelial cell proliferation. Angiogenesis is stimulated at doses as low as 20 pg when tested in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. These results strongly suggest that monobutyrin is a key regulatory molecule in an angiogenic process linked to normal cellular and tissue development."

https://openalex.org/W1598760962,"The leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (LAM-1, TQ1, Leu-8), expressed by human lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and their precursors, is a member of the selectin family of cellular adhesion/homing receptors which play important roles in leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions. These cell surface molecules contain an amino-terminal lectin-like domain followed by an epidermal growth factor-like domain and a variable number of short consensus repeat sequences similar to those found in C3/C4 binding proteins. In this report, the structure of the lyam-1 gene that encodes the LAM-1 protein was determined by isolating overlapping genomic DNA clones that hybridized with a LAM-1 cDNA probe. The lyam-1 gene spans greater than 30 kilo base pairs of DNA and is composed of at least 10 exons. The 5' end of the LAM-1 mRNA was mapped by primer extension analysis revealing a single initiation region for transcription. Exons II through X contain translated sequences; exon II encodes the translation initiation codon; exon III, the leader peptide; IV, the lectin-like domain; V, the epidermal growth factor-like domain; VI and VII, the short consensus repeat units; exon VIII, the transmembrane region; exon IX encodes seven amino acids containing a potential phosphorylation site; and exon X encodes the five remaining amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail and the long 3' untranslated region. Sequencing of LAM-1 cDNA clones derived from neutrophils revealed that the protein expressed by neutrophils would be identical in sequence with the protein expressed by lymphocytes and cDNAs that would encode different isoforms of LAM-1 protein were not detected. In addition, the level of LAM-1 expression by lymphocytes and neutrophils from two patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a disorder in which linkage of phosphatidylinositol anchors to proteins is defective, was similar to that of normal controls. Therefore, the usage of exons II through X results in the generation of a single major LAM-1 protein product expressed by lymphocytes and neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1485530300,"Hyaluronic acid (HA) was extracted from the cell layer of cultured mouse dermal fibroblasts with 6 M guanidine HCl in the presence of 8% (w/v) Zwittergent. HA could be separated from the bulk of extracted proteins by consecutive isopycnic centrifugation and gel and ion-exchange chromatography under dissociative conditions. The final preparation was the complex of HA (viscosity average molecular weight approximately 2 x 10(6)) and a protein of Mr approximately 85,000 in a molar ratio of 1:1. Since the extraction procedure employed has been shown to break most noncovalent bonds between HA and proteins, they would appear to be covalently linked. However, the HA-binding protein remained unlabeled even after long incubation of the cells in the presence of a highly radioactive amino acid mixture, suggesting that it is an exogenous protein derived from the fetal calf serum added to culture medium. The presence of a HA-binding 85-kDa protein could in fact be demonstrated in fetal calf serum as well as sera from various other sources. This protein cross-reacted with antibodies raised against the HA-protein complex purified from cultured mouse dermal cells and was retained on octyl-Sepharose. Like the cell-derived 85-kDa protein, the serum 85-kDa protein, once bound to HA, could not be released from the complex by various dissociative procedures. These results, taken together, suggest that the hydrophobic serum protein can be intercalated into cell surface membranes, thereby mediating the binding of HA to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1552768533,"S49 mouse lymphoma cells respond to swelling deformation with rapid increases in intracellular calcium and cAMP. Experiments demonstrate that these increases in calcium and cAMP concentrations are not coupled in a regulatory manner. Direct inhibition of adenylate cyclase in wild type cells with miconazole prevented swelling-induced accumulation of cAMP. No effect of swelling was observed on the activity of cAMP phosphodiesterase. Additionally, complete inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase did not prevent swelling-induced cAMP accumulation. Experiments involving cyc- mutants (lacking the Gs-alpha protein) and 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine indicate that increased adenylate cyclase activity with swelling is not mediated by Gs. No evidence was found for attenuation of Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity following swelling. In addition, exposure to pertussis toxin or phorbol ester, which disrupts Gi inhibition of adenylate cyclase did not prevent cAMP accumulation following swelling. Disruption of the actin membrane skeleton resulted in a significant accumulation of cAMP which was not further increased by swelling. Disruption of the microtubular cytoskeleton also increased cAMP content in S49 cells which could be further increased by swelling. It is concluded that S49 cell-adenylate cyclase responds directly to mechanical forces transmitted through the actin membrane skeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1497005879,"The ars operon of the conjugative R-factor R773 confers resistance to arsenicals by coding for an anion pump for extrusion of arsenicals from cells of Escherichia coli. The operon encodes three structural genes arsA, arsB, and arsC. The anion pump requires only two polypeptides, the ArsA and ArsB proteins. Purified ArsA protein exhibits oxyanion-stimulated ATPase activity and was demonstrated to bind ATP by photoaffinity labeling with [alpha-32P]ATP. Analysis of the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the arsA gene suggests that the ArsA protein contains two potential nucleotide binding folds, one in the N-terminal half and one in the C-terminal half of the protein. A combination of site-directed and bisulfite mutagenesis was used to alter the glycine-rich region of the N-terminal putative nucleotide-binding sequence G15KGGVGKTS23. Four mutant proteins (G18----D, G18----R, G20----S, and T22----I) were analyzed. Strains bearing the mutated plasmids were all arsenite sensitive and were unable to extrude arsenite. Each purified mutant protein lacked oxyanion-stimulated ATPase activity and ATP binding. These results suggest that the N-terminal sequence is part of a nucleotide-binding domain required for catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1568046905,"Pituitary and placental glycoprotein hormones are heterodimers with alpha-subunits of identical primary structure, but dissimilar beta-subunits. Regions of structural similarity between the beta-subunits might be involved in interaction with the homologous alpha-subunits, and regions of structural dissimilarity could, therefore, be candidates for receptor interactions. A restrained matrix dot-plot analysis identified hFSH-beta-(8-32) and hFSH-beta-(55-65) as candidates for interaction with alpha-subunit. Therefore, by subtraction, hFSH-beta-(33-54) and hFSH-beta-(66-111) seemed candidates for regions of interaction with receptor. In a previous report we demonstrated that hFSH-beta-(33-53) represented a receptor-binding region of hFSH-beta. Analysis of structural parameters (flexibility, surface probability, secondary structure prediction, etc.) indicates similarities between hFSH-beta-(33-53) and hFSH-beta-(85-95), suggesting the latter might be the component of hFSH-beta-(61-111) interacting with the receptor. Testing of 11 synthetic peptides, corresponding to the primary structure of hFSH-beta, demonstrated that hFSH-beta-(31-45)-peptide amide, were unique in ability to inhibit 125I-follicle-stimulating hormone binding to receptor. hFSH-beta-(81-95)-peptide amide also stimulated estradiol biosynthesis in Sertoli cell cultures. The correlation between binding inhibition and surface probability, flexibility, and predicted secondary structure (alpha, extended, and turn) was highly significant (R2 = 0.87, p less than 0.0001). Regression significance for these parameters, taken individually, were very poor. Receptor-binding regions, therefore, appear to be characterized by a particular and complex arrangement of secondary structure motifs, surface probability, and flexibility."
https://openalex.org/W1516516051,"Monoclonal antibodies produced against native interferon-gamma receptor (IFN gamma-R) have been characterized for their capacity to react with purified receptor and receptor-positive cells, to inhibit the binding of IFN gamma to cellular receptor, to precipitate the receptor protein when cross-linked to IFN-gamma, and to recognize the recombinant interferon-gamma receptor and 19 overlapping fragments of this protein expressed in Escherichia coli. The results of this analysis showed that: (i) the extracellular portion of human IFN gamma-R is located between the N terminus and the transmembrane region (amino acids 18-246). (ii) The intracellular domain is between the transmembrane region and the C terminus (amino acids 269-489). (iii) The monoclonal antibodies that react with the IFN gamma-R intracellular domain recognize small linear epitopes. (iv) The human IFN gamma-R binding site is located between the N terminus and the transmembrane region. (v) The monoclonal antibodies that react with IFN gamma-R extracellular domain and inhibit the binding of IFN gamma recognize two different epitopes. One of these epitopes (included between amino acids 26 and 133) is very close to the binding site for IFN gamma. The second (included between amino acids 70 and 210) is related to the binding site for IFN gamma without including it. (vi) These two functional epitopes are conformational and need S-S bridges to maintain their architecture. (vii) These conformational epitopes are formed in receptor fragments expressed in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1624440538,"Reverse transcriptase has been purified from feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) by DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose chromatography. The purified enzyme consists of a single protein with a Mr of 67,000. When proteolysis is not minimized during purification, a fragment of Mr 54,000 is also observed. This is similar to the reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV), which consists of a polypeptide of Mr 66,000; when proteolysis is not minimized during purification, a fragment of Mr 51,000 is also observed. In direct comparisons, the FIV reverse transcriptase is very similar to the HIV reverse transcriptase in template specificity and requirements for Mg2+. In contrast to these similarities, the FIV and HIV reverse transcriptases are substantially different in primary sequence, as determined by peptide mapping."
https://openalex.org/W1555689915,"We have studied the regulation of thymidine kinase mRNA and protein/enzyme expression in quiescent and serum-stimulated rat cells transfected with a human TK cDNA clone expressed from a number of promoters. Our results indicate that while the pattern of mRNA expression is a function of the promoter used, the pattern of protein/enzyme expression is not. When the gene is expressed from the homologous human TK promoter both mRNA and enzyme levels remain low throughout G1 and increase as the cells enter S phase. When it is expressed from the heterologous SV40 early promoter, mRNA levels are high throughout G1, but enzyme and protein levels remain low until 8-10 h following serum stimulation. Thus, protein levels appear to be uncoupled from mRNA levels in this system, suggesting the presence of translational and/or posttranslational regulation. An analysis of mutant cDNA clones indicates that this regulation is not dependent upon sequences at the 5' or 3' end of the cDNA, including the entire 5'-untranslated region, the authentic AUG and the first 48 nucleotides of the coding region."
https://openalex.org/W2095765431,"Sixty-six murine hybridomas raised to Escherichia coli B/r porin were used to identify and differentiate the epitopes of this outer membrane protein. Anti-porin monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were raised against outer membrane fragments, purified native trimeric porin (trimer), and purified sodium dodecyl sulfate-denatured monomeric porin (monomer). Immunochemical and flow cytometric methods identified five distinct cell surface-exposed determinants on OmpF. The peptide composition of porin epitopes was determined by analysis of mAb reactivity with cyanogen bromide-generated peptide fragments. Four of 43 anti-monomer mAb reacted with surface exposed sites on OmpF, defining epitopes that consist of residues within CNBr peptides d2, d3, and B. The anti-porin mAb panel was also used to evaluate changes in porin antigenic structure in strains with short ompF deletions. Flow cytometric experiments indicated that despite changes in porin permeability, little if any alteration of surface epitopes occurred in these strains. Western immunoblot analysis of the mutant porins showed loss of reactivity with numerous mAb, which was caused by changes in three spatially distinct epitopes at residues 108-111, 118-123, and 124-129. Our findings indicate that in these ompF mutants the residues responsible for altering porin permeability are not exposed on the cell surface, but are buried within the tertiary structure of the protein. One of these regions, which is apparently involved in the determination of channel permeability characteristics, is conserved among 15 of 16 different porin molecules which were screened with the anti-OmpF mAb panel."
https://openalex.org/W1487681216,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-resistant mutants which did not respond to LPS were isolated from a macrophage-like mouse cell line, J774.1. Unlike the parental J774.1 cells, these mutants grew even in LPS added medium as well as in normal growth medium without any morphological changes. Assay of 125I-LPS binding to the cell monolayers revealed that one of these LPS-resistant mutants (LR-9) was strikingly defective in LPS-binding activity. Scatchard plot showed that LR-9 cells lacked the high affinity binding sites which were present in J774.1. The high affinity binding was inhibited by addition of excess unlabeled LPS, lipid A, lipid IVA (tetraacyl-beta(1'-6)-linked D-glucosamine disaccharide-1,4'-bisphosphate), and lipid X (2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate) and sensitive to proteinase K. LPS enhanced O2- generation and the release of arachidonic acid in J774.1 cells but not in LR-9 cells. Other stimulants such as zymosan and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, however, induced the release of arachidonic acid in LR-9 cells as well as in J774.1 cells. LPS-photocross-linked assay allowed the identification of 65- and 55-kDa LPS-binding proteins in the membrane fraction of J774.1 cells. Both of the bands were not detectable in that of LR-9 cells and disappeared by competing with unlabeled LPS or lipid X. These results show that one or both of the two LPS-binding proteins might relate to the specific membrane receptor for LPS."
https://openalex.org/W1638254002,"ATP, 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP (BzATP), a photoaffinity analog of ATP, and several other ATP analogs induced an increase in plasma membrane permeability to monovalent ions and normally impermeant metabolites, including nucleotides, in transformed 3T6 mouse fibroblasts. The rank order of agonist potency for induction of nucleotide channels was BzATP (EC50 = 15 microM) greater than ATP (EC50 = 50 microM) approximately adenosine 5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) (ATP alpha S) greater than 2-methylthio-ATP (EC50 = 75 microM) approximately 3'-amino-3'-deoxy-ATP greater than adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S) (EC50 = 175 microM). Long wavelength UV illumination of 3T6 cells in the presence of greater than or equal to 20 microM BzATP at 4 degrees C, a nonpermeabilizing temperature, followed by removal of unbound BzATP, resulted in the efflux of 86Rb+ and the release of a prelabeled pool of cytoplasmic nucleotides when the temperature was shifted to 37 degrees C. Photoincorporation of BzATP was inhibited by ATP, ATP alpha S, ATP gamma S, and other ATP analogs that induced an increase in plasma membrane permeability to nucleotides in 3T6 cells under nonphotoactivating conditions. GTP, ITP, UTP, adenosine, and ATP analogs that did not alter plasma membrane permeability to nucleotides under nonphotoactivating conditions also had no effect on BzATP photoincorporation. Photoincorporation of BzATP occurred optimally between pH 6.6 and pH 8.2 but was inhibited at pH 6.0. Photoincorporation of BzATP was also modulated by the osmolarity and the divalent cation concentration of the assay medium. The increase in plasma membrane permeability to nucleotides induced by photoincorporated BzATP occurred at the same rate and had the same temperature, pH, ionic strength, and divalent cation requirements as the increase in plasma membrane permeability to nucleotides induced by ATP and BzATP under nonphotoactivating conditions. These findings support the hypothesis that BzATP can be covalently incorporated into a P2 purinoceptor in 3T6 cells that is coupled to plasma membrane channels for ions and other metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W1600615773,"The beta-2 adrenergic receptor has been proposed to have seven membrane-spanning domains. Expression of functional beta-2 adrenergic receptor was achieved in a heterologous cell-free system composed of rabbit reticulocyte lysate and microsomal membranes from Xenopus laevis oocytes. The functional state of the receptor protein can be determined by ligand-binding assays and by the ability of ligands to alter the susceptibility of the receptor to proteinase K digestion. The process by which functional receptor is made was studied. The receptor protein remains nonfunctional immediately following translocation and glycosylation, and additional processing steps are needed before the receptor is able to interact with ligands. These processing steps require intact microsomal membranes as well as several cytosolic factors including ATP and one or more high molecular mass (greater than 30 kDa) factors but do not require receptor glycosylation and are not inhibited by nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues."
https://openalex.org/W1513641086,"The synthesis of complement components in human fibroblasts is modulated by mediators of inflammation such as cytokines. In particular, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induce time- and dose-dependent increases in the synthesis of complement proteins factor B (FB), C3, and factor H (FH). Polypeptide growth factors are also soluble mediators released during inflammation and able to modulate many fibroblast functions. We have studied the effects of polypeptide growth factors platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) on the synthesis of complement proteins in cultured human fibroblasts. PDGF, EGF, and FGF alone did not affect the level of synthesis of any of the complement proteins analyzed, but simultaneous incubation of PDGF, EGF, or FGF with IL-1 and TNF resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the cytokine-enhanced expression of FB. Inhibition of FB synthesis was observed between 4 and 8 h of exposure to PDGF and persisted for 4 h after the removal of the growth factor. Analysis of steady-state levels of specific FB mRNA suggested that PDGF-induced inhibition of FB synthesis is mediated at a pretranslational level and that it requires new protein synthesis. The effect of the growth factors was limited to FB, with marginal or no inhibition on the cytokine-enhanced synthesis of C3 and FH, excluding the possibility that the inhibitory effects of PDGF, EGF, and FGF on FB synthesis were due to a negative modulation of the growth factors on cytokine cell membrane receptors. Specific inhibition of cytokine-induced increases in FB synthesis by the growth factors may represent down regulation of the acute inflammatory process, further permitting progression to processes of tissue repair and remodeling. Study of the interactions between cytokines and growth factors in the regulation of synthesis of complement proteins may also provide a system for investigating mechanisms of signal transduction of both polypeptide growth factors and cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1573477538,"Colicin E1 is a soluble, bacteriocidal protein that forms voltage-gated channels in planar lipid bilayers. The channel-forming region of the 522-amino acid protein is near the COOH terminus, and contains a 35-amino acid hydrophobic segment which is presumed to be important in interacting with the membrane. We have used site-directed mutagenesis in the region immediately upstream from the hydrophobic segment to construct several functional colicin mutants in which a wild-type residue was replaced with a cysteine. We also replaced the only naturally occurring cysteine in the molecule, Cys-505, with alanine, so that synthetically introduced cysteines could unambiguously serve as targets for chemical modification. All of the replacements reported here (at positions 449, 459, 473, 505, and some combinations) resulted in a channel that had an ion selectivity (K+ versus Cl-) identical to wild type at low pH. At higher pH, however, one of these mutations, which replaced the negatively charged aspartate at position 473 (the upstream boundary of the hydrophobic segment), resulted in a channel that was less cation-selective than was wild type. When the introduced Cys-473 was reacted with iodoacetic acid, which inserted a COOH group close to the position of the missing aspartate COOH, wild-type ion selectivity was restored, suggesting that the greater cation selectivity of the wild-type channel was directly produced by the negative charge at Asp-473. By comparing the ion selectivity of the Cys-473 mutant channel to that of the wild type as a function of the pH on the cis and trans sides of the membrane, it was possible to locate residue 473 close to the cis side. Locating in this manner the positions in the channel of particular residues places important constraints on channel model building."
https://openalex.org/W1577352657,"The Mauriceville and Varkud mitochondrial plasmids of Neurospora are closely related, closed-circular DNAs (3.6 and 3.7 kilobases, respectively) that have characteristics of mtDNA introns and retroid elements. The plasmids contain a single long open reading frame (710 amino acids), whose amino-terminal half has structural similarity to reverse transcriptases. Using antibodies against synthetic peptides and trpE fusion proteins, we detected an 81-kDa protein encoded by this open reading frame in mitochondrial preparations from the plasmid-containing strains. This 81-kDa protein cosegregates with reverse transcriptase activity in sexual crosses and comigrates with reverse transcriptase activity in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, where it can be assayed after renaturation of the protein. In glycerol gradients under nondenaturing conditions, the reverse transcriptase activity sediments at approximately 145 kDa, close to the value expected for a dimer of the 81-kDa protein. The 81-kDa protein represents most of the 710-amino acid open reading frame, but may be missing some amino acids at the amino terminus. The regions upstream and downstream of the putative reverse transcriptase domain lack sequences characteristic of gag, protease, RNase H, or integrase domains found in other retroid elements. The plasmid-encoded 81-kDa protein seems to be a novel type of reverse transcriptase that may provide insight into the evolution of these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1540733241,"Accurate at promoters by polymerase II in a highly purified transcription system from rat liver depends on five accessory factors, which comprise two functional classes: (i) promoter factors, designated tau and epsilon, which interact with DNA to form an initial complex that serves as a recognition site for binding by polymerase II and (ii) RNA chain initiation factors, designated alpha, beta gamma, and delta, which do not participate in initial complex formation, but which are essential for (Conaway, J. W., Reines, D., and Conaway, R. C. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7552-7558). Here we investigate the roles of alpha, beta gamma, and delta in accurate initiation. Kinetic evidence indicates that all three factors act in a stage prior to synthesis to facilitate formation of a functional preinitiation complex. Moreover, results of template challenge experiments argue that all three factors become stably associated with the preinitiation complex during this stage. Neither alpha, beta gamma, nor delta functions catalytically in this process; instead, each factor appears to interact directly and stoichiometrically with intermediates in assembly of the preinitiation complex. Order of addition experiments reveal that transcription factors alpha and beta gamma assemble into the preinitiation complex by an ordered mechanism. We discuss two recently proposed models for assembly of the functional preinitiation complex and argue that our findings provide a plausible means of reconciling them."
https://openalex.org/W1570833539,"A mouse spleen-derived mast cell line (PT-18) was employed to examine the mechanisms of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated inhibition of antigen-induced lipid mediator biosynthesis. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that increasing cAMP in mast cells inhibits lipid mediator biosynthesis by a mechanism independent of effects on histamine release (degranulation) or changes in cytosolic calcium concentration. Forskolin inhibited antigen-induced prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), leukotriene C4 (LTC4), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production by 30-50%. In contrast, forskolin had no inhibitory effect on antigen-induced increases in cytosolic calcium concentration, as monitored by the calcium indicator fura-2, or histamine release from the cells. The combination of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine with forskolin inhibited the antigen-induced production of PGD2 and LTC4 by 90-100% and histamine release by about 60%. These responses were accompanied by a virtual abolition of the antigen-induced increase in cytosolic calcium. To test further the hypothesis that increasing cAMP can lead to inhibition of lipid mediator biosynthesis in the absence of effects on cytosolic calcium, we employed the calcium ionophores A23187 and ionomycin. Forskolin alone or in combination with isobutylmethylxanthine had no effect on ionophore-induced increases in cytosolic calcium but effectively inhibited leukotriene biosynthesis. In addition, increasing cyclic AMP led to an inhibition of ionophore-induced production of platelet-activating factor and liberation of arachidonic acid. These data suggest that a relatively modest increase in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity in mast cells leads to inhibition of the lipase-catalyzed cleavage of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids in the absence of measurable effects on either histamine release or changes in cytosolic calcium concentration. This effect results in a selective inhibition of the biosynthesis of lipid mediators including LTC4, LTB4, PGD2, and platelet-activating factor."
https://openalex.org/W2066814467,"It is a challenge to construct synthetic immunogens that elicit antibodies (Abs) both directed to conformational epitopes and specific for a complex protein like human choriogonadotropin (hCG). A monoclonal antibody specific for hCG bound to regions around Lys45 of the alpha subunit (hCG alpha) and Asp112 of the beta subunit (hCG beta). A peptide comprising residues 46 to 55 of hCG alpha and residues 106 to 116 of hCG beta elicited Abs in rabbits that were directed to a discontinuous epitope and were specific for hCG. These Abs inhibited the binding of hCG to its receptor. Thus, a synthetic immunogen can mimic a conformational-specific epitope and can be useful for vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W1643228568,"We have previously shown that bradykinin-induced production of second messengers such as inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol in neurotumor cells is inhibited by raising cellular cyclic AMP levels, which in turn inhibit phospholipase C. A monoclonal antibody to phospholipase C-II immunoprecipitated the 140-kDa form of phospholipase C-II from [35S]methionine/[3H]eucine-labeled cells, but not [32P]orthophosphate-labeled phospholipase C-II, following treatment with either forskolin or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. This suggested that phospholipase C is not the target for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation. In vitro studies confirmed that phospholipase C activity was inhibited by raising cellular cAMP levels, and partial sensitivity to Bordetella pertussis toxin suggested the involvement of a GTP-binding protein which could be the target for protein kinase A. The involvement of a GTP-binding protein in coupling the bradykinin receptor to phospholipase C was further suggested by the ability of both guanosine 5'-O-(thio-triphosphate) and fluoride (NaF) to release inositol phosphates from NCB-20 cell membranes previously labeled with [3H]inositol. Both effects were blocked by pretreatment of the cells with protein kinase A activators, further suggesting a GTP-binding protein as the target for protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation. When whole NCB-20 cell extracts were blotted onto nitrocellulose and incubated with [alpha- 32P]GTP, a major 24-kDa band plus minor bands at 22 and 20 kDa were revealed by autoradiography. A pH 3.0/6.0 soluble (basic protein) NCB-20 cell extract revealed the major 24-kDa band plus the 20-kDa band, and similar basic proteins were shown to be heavily phosphorylated following [32P]orthophosphate labeling and pretreatment with forskolin. The size and ability to bind GTP on Western blots are characteristic of the ras, rho, smg, etc. family of GTP-binding proteins recently suggested to be the much sought after GPLC (Lapetina, E.G., Lacal, J. C., Reep, B. R., and Molina y Vedia, L. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 3131-3134; Wang, P., Nishihata, J., Takabori, E., Yamamoto, K., Toyoshima, S., and Osawa, T. (1989) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 105, 461-466; Nagata, K.-I., Nagao, S., and Nozawa, Y. (1989) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 160, 235-242). We propose that GPLC is uniquely sensitive to protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation and that phosphorylation inhibits stimulus-secretion coupling in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1600492551,"Uptake and release of purines by red blood cells has been shown to be markedly sensitive to changes in pH, inorganic phosphate (Pi), and oxygen concentration (Berman, P., Black, D., Human, L., and Harley, E. (1988) J. Clin. Invest. 82, 980-986). The mechanism of this regulation has been further studied. We have shown that incubation of red cells in medium containing xanthine oxidase rapidly and completely depletes intracellular hypoxanthine and causes accumulation of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) at physiological Pi concentrations. Hypoxanthine release from intracellular IMP is strictly dependent on PRPP depletion, induced by either alkalinizing the cells or by adding excess adenine. Xanthine oxidase abolishes this dependence. Oxygen depletion enhances adenine uptake and prevents hypoxanthine release. The results suggest that hypoxanthine release is governed by PRPP-dependent recycling of hypoxanthine to IMP. We propose that PRPP accumulation in red cells is regulated by a substrate cycle, comprising hypoxanthine, IMP, and inosine. Cycle flux is controlled by Pi inhibition and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate activation of purine-5'-nucleotidase, which converts IMP to inosine. Oxypurine cycling may account for the sensitive control of purine uptake and release by changes in pH and oxygen tension that occur physiologically."
https://openalex.org/W1962156317,"Escherichia coli RNA polymerase transcription elongation complexes have been prepared that contain a photo-cross-linking uridine analog at only the 3' end, or one or two nucleotides removed from the 3' end, in the nascent RNA chain. Additionally, complexes have been isolated in which the analog has been substituted for every UMP residue, at positions ranging from 20 to 140 nucleotides from the 3' end. The RNA has been photochemically cross-linked to the RNA polymerase to identify the subunits that form the binding site(s) for these regions in the nascent RNA. The photo-cross-linking nucleotide analog used for these studies was 5-[4-azidophenacyl)thio)uridine-5'-triphosphate (5-APAS-UTP), which acts as a 10-15 A probe. With 5-APAS-UMP positioned only at the 3' end of the RNA, or one or two nucleotides from the 3' end, only the beta subunit appeared to be contacted. When the analog was positioned throughout the RNA, both the beta and beta' subunits were contacted. No labeling of the sigma or alpha subunits was observed with any RNA length. In addition to placing this analog at specific positions in short RNAs, we have carried out transcription studies with 5-APAS-UTP to determine the optimal UTP to analog ratio for production of full length, photoreactive transcripts. Surprisingly, we found that when transcription complexes were stalled shortly after initiation, by deletion of one ribonucleoside triphosphate to synchronize transcription, changes in transcriptional pausing occurred downstream. These results suggest that events that occur early in transcription can affect the elongation and/or termination events that occur far downstream from the promoter. This effect occurred even with UTP but was greatly enhanced by replacement of UTP with either this analog or 4-thio-UTP. By enhancing the normal transcriptional pausing event, these analogs can serve as probes of the conformational changes that may exist in paused transcription complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2036840401,"Desensitization occurs when the response to a neurotransmitter receptor agonist wanes in the continued presence of agonist. In amphibian sympathetic neurons, both muscarinic and peptidergic receptor agonists inhibit a K+ current, the M-current (IM), and this inhibition desensitizes. We have studied the desensitization to substance P (SP) by whole-cell recordings from dissociated sympathetic neurons from bullfrogs. When ATP in the recording pipette was replaced with AMP-PNP, SP still inhibited IM, but no desensitization was observed, indicating that ATP hydrolysis is required for desensitization. Desensitization inhibitors of beta-adrenergic receptors did not block desensitization to SP. When a low dose of muscarine sufficient to inhibit IM, but not to elicit desensitization, was applied simultaneously with a desensitizing dose of SP, IM remained depressed and did not desensitize. Thus, there may be separate systems controlling desensitization for different agonists, or the enzyme(s) involved is ""compartmentalized."""

https://openalex.org/W1532240626,"We have used oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes to investigate possible interactions between chloramphenicol and portions of the rRNA contained within the peptidyltransferase center of the Escherichia coli ribosome. Oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes complementary to bases 2448-2454, 2468-2482, and 2497-2505 of 23 S rRNA were hybridized to 50 S subunits in situ. Probe binding was qualitatively assessed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Each probe was shown to bind specifically with its intended binding site through digestion of the rRNA within the RNA/DNA hetero-duplexes with RNase H and analysis of the digestion fragments using gel electrophoresis. Competitive binding experiments were conducted between each probe and the antibiotics chloramphenicol and erythromycin. The binding of a probe complementary to bases 2497-2505 was attenuated by 70% upon the binding of chloramphenicol. A probe complementary to bases 2468-2482 showed an increase in binding of 14% while binding of a probe complementary to bases 2448-2454 was not affected by chloramphenicol binding. Erythromycin did not affect the binding of any of these probes to 50 S subunits. These results suggest that bases within the 2497-2505 region of 23 S rRNA in E. coli may be involved in a chloramphenicol/rRNA interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1508967839,"In the presence of a monoclonal raised against the human thrombin-antithrombin III complex, the reaction between thrombin and antithrombin III proceeded to form preferentially a two-chain form of the inhibitor rather than to follow the major pathway of stable acyl complex formation. We thus propose the term switching antibody for an that switches the enzyme-inhibitor reaction (Asakura, S., Matsuda, M., Yoshida, N., Terukina, S., and Kihara, H. (1989) J. Biol.

This particular region should be cryptic in nascent antithrombin III, but could have been exposed to provide the reactive site for the at an early stage of the reaction. Thereby a conformational change may have been induced at or near the reactive site of the complex, facilitating hydrolysis of the inhibitor by the enzyme. Interestingly, this hydrophobic region is highly conserved among members of the serpin family."
https://openalex.org/W1545218404,"Treatment of intact human umbilical vein endothelial cells with NaF results in a dose-dependent biphasic response in both prostacyclin and inositol phosphate production: the stimulation observed with 10-20 mM NaF decreases with higher concentrations. High concentrations of NaF furthermore reduce thrombin- or A23187-stimulated prostacyclin production. Direct assay of phospholipase C activity in cell homogenates shows a similar biphasic response to NaF, also after chelation of Ca2+; addition of AlCl3 shifts the inhibition toward lower NaF concentrations. Guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) also causes a dose-dependent biphasic response in inositol phosphate formation in permeabilized cells and homogenates; a higher inhibitory concentration of GTP gamma S abolishes the stimulation of inositol phosphate production by low NaF concentrations. A high concentration of NaF furthermore inhibits the non-G-protein-dependent activation of phospholipase C by deoxycholate. NaF also induces a dose-dependent biphasic response in cyclic AMP formation in intact cells, indicating that the inhibition of phospholipase C at higher NaF concentrations does not result from a rise in cyclic AMP. The data are compatible with the existence of a guanine nucleotide-dependent, cyclic AMP-independent, phospholipase C-inhibitory pathway in endothelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W1553773871,"We have used a photoreactive cross-linking reagent, poly(A/8-N3-A) (a poly(A) of average molecular mass of 100 kDa in which 5-10% of the A residues are replaced by 8-N3-A), to label poly(A) binding proteins of rat liver nuclear envelopes. This reagent was prepared by polymerizing a mixture of ADP and 8-N3-ADP with polynucleotide phosphorylase. The purified poly(A) was labeled in the 5'-position with a 32P group. In nuclear envelopes prepared by a low salt DNase I procedure, the poly(A/8-N3-A) labeled a protein-nucleic acid complex of approximately 270 kDa, which on degradation with RNase U2 or NaOH at pH 10 yielded two polypeptides of approximately 50 and 30 kDa. These photoreaction products were markedly decreased when resealed nuclear envelopes or non-nuclear envelope proteins were irradiated in the presence of poly(A/8-N3-A). The affinity labeling was intensified when resealed vesicles were made leaky by freezing or ultrasonication, suggesting that the poly(A) binding proteins are accessible from the nucleoplasmic but not the cytoplasmic face of the envelope. Moreover binding was specific for poly(A). Alternative reagents, random poly(A/8-N3-A,C,G,U) of about 100 kDa and poly(dA) (molecular mass between 350 and 515 kDa), showed a very low affinity for poly(A) recognition proteins in the low salt DNase I-treated nuclear envelopes; the 270-kDa band was labeled only weakly. The binding site was not protected by poly(A,C,G,U), weakly by poly(dA), and distinctly by poly(A)."
https://openalex.org/W1567384329,"Monoclonal antibodies directed against the native form of the beta 2 subunit of Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase strongly inhibit both its tryptophan synthase and its serine deaminase activities. The mechanism of this inactivation is studied here, by monitoring quantitatively the absorption and fluorescence properties of different well-characterized successive intermediates in the catalytic cycle of tryptophan synthase. It is shown that the antibodies interfere specifically with the formation of one or the other of these intermediates. It is concluded that the antibodies either modify or block the molecular flexibility of the protein, thus preventing conformational changes that the protein has to undergo during the catalysis. At least two different stages of the catalytic process, each one sensitive to a different class of antibodies, are shown to involve molecular movements of the polypeptide chain. Indications are given on the regions of the molecule involved in these movements."

https://openalex.org/W1550086929,"NMR and ESR spectroscopies have been used to examine the plasma protease inhibitor pregnancy zone protein (PZP) and its complex with chymotrypsin. The 1H NMR spectrum of PZP shows relatively few sharp resonances, which, by analogy with human alpha 2-macroglobulin, probably arise from the proteolytically sensitive bait region. Upon reaction with chymotrypsin to form a 1:1 protease.PZP tetramer complex, there is a large increase in the intensity of sharp resonances due to an increase in mobility of these residues. 35Cl NMR has been used to follow binding of zinc and manganese to apo-PZP. Zinc binding causes a linear broadening of the bulk Cl-, consistent with access of Cl- to PZP-bound zinc. Since zinc in the two highest affinity sites in human alpha 2-macroglobulin causes no broadening of Cl-, it is concluded that these zinc sites are absent from PZP. The mobility of chymotrypsin in the PZP.chymotrypsin complex was examined by covalently attaching a nitroxide spin label at the serine residue in the active site of the enzyme and examining the appearance of the ESR spectrum. The chymotrypsin is rigidly held by the PZP to which it is covalently bound. In an analogous experiment performed previously on alpha 2-macroglobulin, chymotrypsin, bound in the presence of methylamine and therefore largely noncovalently bound, was found to be free to rotate inside the cage formed by the protease inhibitor."
