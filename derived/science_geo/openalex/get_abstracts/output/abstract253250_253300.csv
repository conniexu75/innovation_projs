https://openalex.org/W2165977355,"Western United States forest wildfire activity is widely thought to have increased in recent decades, yet neither the extent of recent changes nor the degree to which climate may be driving regional changes in wildfire has been systematically documented. Much of the public and scientific discussion of changes in western United States wildfire has focused instead on the effects of 19th- and 20th-century land-use history. We compiled a comprehensive database of large wildfires in western United States forests since 1970 and compared it with hydroclimatic and land-surface data. Here, we show that large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons. The greatest increases occurred in mid-elevation, Northern Rockies forests, where land-use histories have relatively little effect on fire risks and are strongly associated with increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring snowmelt."
https://openalex.org/W2155163967,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) allows the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to recover from the accumulation of misfolded proteins, in part by increasing its folding capacity. Inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1) promotes this remodeling by detecting misfolded ER proteins and activating a transcription factor, X-box-binding protein 1, through endonucleolytic cleavage of its messenger RNA (mRNA). Here, we report that IRE1 independently mediates the rapid degradation of a specific subset of mRNAs, based both on their localization to the ER membrane and on the amino acid sequence they encode. This response is well suited to complement other UPR mechanisms because it could selectively halt production of proteins that challenge the ER and clear the translocation and folding machinery for the subsequent remodeling process."
https://openalex.org/W1963531331,"Hierarchical self-assembly offers a powerful strategy for producing molecular nanostructures. Although widely used, the mechanistic details of self-assembly processes are poorly understood. We spectroscopically monitored a nucleation process in the self-assembly of p-conjugated molecules into helical supramolecular fibrillar structures. The data support a nucleation-growth pathway that gives rise to a remarkably high degree of cooperativity. Furthermore, we characterize a helical transition in the nucleating species before growth. The self-assembly process depends strongly on solvent structure, suggesting that an organized shell of solvent molecules plays an explicit role in rigidifying the aggregates and guiding them toward further assembly into bundles and/or gels."
https://openalex.org/W2062935524,"Natural populations of beach mice exhibit a characteristic color pattern, relative to their mainland conspecifics, driven by natural selection for crypsis. We identified a derived, charge-changing amino acid mutation in the melanocortin-1 receptor ( Mc1r ) in beach mice, which decreases receptor function. In genetic crosses, allelic variation at Mc1r explains 9.8% to 36.4% of the variation in seven pigmentation traits determining color pattern. The derived Mc1r allele is present in Florida's Gulf Coast beach mice but not in Atlantic coast mice with similar light coloration, suggesting that different molecular mechanisms are responsible for convergent phenotypic evolution. Here, we link a single mutation in the coding region of a pigmentation gene to adaptive quantitative variation in the wild."
https://openalex.org/W1993165949,"The drought of 1983 resulted in some 10 billion dollars in agricultural losses and has focused attention on the vulnerability of our major crops to this devastating form of environmental stress. This article is concerned with the molecular biology of a new class of genes, called osm (osmotic tolerance) genes, that protect bacteria like Escherichia coli against osmotic stress and may work in a similar manner in plants and animals. Osm genes govern the production of a class of molecules, such as betaine and proline, that protect the cell and its constituents against dehydration. These osmoprotectant molecules have been known for many years to accumulate in plants but have only recently been shown to have potent antistress activity for bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2052373675,"Mutations in the nuclear envelope proteins lamins A and C cause a broad variety of human diseases, including Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. Cells lacking lamins A and C have reduced nuclear stiffness and increased nuclear fragility, leading to increased cell death under mechanical strain and suggesting a potential mechanism for disease. Here, we investigated the contribution of major lamin subtypes (lamins A, C, and B1) to nuclear mechanics by analyzing nuclear shape, nuclear dynamics over time, nuclear deformations under strain, and cell viability under prolonged mechanical stimulation in cells lacking both lamins A and C, cells lacking only lamin A (i.e. “lamin C-only” cells), cells lacking wild-type lamin B1, and wild-type cells. Lamin A/C-deficient cells exhibited increased numbers of misshapen nuclei and had severely reduced nuclear stiffness and decreased cell viability under strain. Lamin C-only cells had slightly abnormal nuclear shape and mildly reduced nuclear stiffness but no decrease in cell viability under strain. Interestingly, lamin B1-deficient cells exhibited normal nuclear mechanics despite having a significantly increased frequency of nuclear blebs. Our study indicates that lamins A and C are important contributors to the mechanical stiffness of nuclei, whereas lamin B1 contributes to nuclear integrity but not stiffness.

Lamins are type V intermediate filament proteins that form the nuclear lamina, a filamentous network underlying the inner nuclear membrane of eukaryotic cells. Lamins form stable structures in the nuclear lamina and the nucleoplasm, determine nuclear shape and size, resist nuclear deformation, and position nuclear pore complexes (reviewed in Refs. 1Gruenbaum Y.

In addition, lamins recruit and anchor, either directly or indirectly, several nuclear envelope proteins (e.g. nesprin-1α, emerin, and the lamin B receptor) to the inner nuclear membrane (3Zastrow M.S. Vlcek S. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).Mammalian cells express two types of lamins, the A and B types. Both share a common structural organization: a globular N-terminal domain separated from a larger C-terminal globular domain by a central helical rod domain that allows lamins to form parallel coiled-coil dimers, which in turn assemble into stable strings and higher order networks. Lamins A and C, the major A-type lamins, are alternatively spliced isoforms of a single gene, LMNA. The expression of A-type lamins is developmentally regulated, beginning midway through embryonic development (4Stewart C. Burke B. Cell. 1987; 51: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). A-type lamins are expressed in most but not all differentiated cells (5Schirmer E.C. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42811-42817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). B-type lamins (lamins B1 and B2) are encoded by separate genes, LMNB1 and LMNB2, respectively (6Schutz W. Benavente R. Alsheimer M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 84: 649-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Unlike A-type lamins, B-type lamins are expressed in all cells and throughout development (7Broers J.L. Machiels B.M.

Burke, personal communication.2B. Burke, personal communication.Mutations in the A-type lamins and associated nuclear envelope proteins cause at least 10 distinct human diseases (laminopathies), including Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction system disease, Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy, and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (reviewed in Refs. 9Broers J.L.

Mice lacking both lamins A and C manifest severe growth retardation as well as skeletal and cardiac muscle dystrophy, and they die by 4-6 weeks of age (14Sullivan T. Escalante-Alcalde D. Bhatt H. Anver M. Bhat N. Nagashima K. Stewart C.L. Burke B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 15Nikolova V. Leimena C. McMahon A.C. Tan J.C. Chandar S. Jogia D.

In contrast, lamin C-deficient mice are entirely healthy (16Fong L.G. Ng J.K. Lammerding J. Vickers T.A. Meta M. Cote N. Gavino B. Qiao X. Chang S.Y. Young S.R. Yang S.H. Stewart C.L. Lee R.T. Bennett C.F. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). No human diseases have yet been linked to mutations in B-type lamins, raising the possibility that the loss of B-type lamins is either inconsequential or lethal during development. Gene silencing experiments in cultured mammalian cells with small interfering RNAs have suggested that lamins B1 and B2 are essential for cell growth and cell viability (17Harborth J. Elbashir S.M. Bechert K. Tuschl T. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4557-4565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetically modified mice lacking wild-type lamin B1 have bone and lung abnormalities during development and die shortly after birth (18Vergnes L. Peterfy M. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Reue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10428-10433Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar).Mechanisms underlying the panoply of human laminopathies (particularly how entirely different tissues are affected in different diseases) are poorly understood. Two hypotheses, neither mutually exclusive, have emerged to explain how mutations in lamin proteins could cause such diverse disease phenotypes (9Broers J.L. Hutchison C.J. Ramaekers F.C. J. Pathol. 2004; 204: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Burke B. Stewart C.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 13Hutchison C.J. Worman H.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The “gene regulation hypothesis” proposes that perturbed gene regulation may underlie the development of different disease phenotypes, whereas the “structural hypothesis” proposes that mutations in the lamin proteins render the nucleus more fragile, causing cell death and eventually disease in mechanically stressed tissues. Recent studies have provided support for both hypotheses (2Hutchison C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 848-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 9Broers J.L. Hutchison C.J.

Genet. 2004; 13: 2567-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and most ongoing research on the nuclear envelope continues to revolve around these two broad hypotheses.The structural hypothesis is compelling, given the obvious scaffolding role of the nuclear lamina and the relationship, at least in some studies, between misshapen nuclei and disease phenotypes in mice (14Sullivan T. Escalante-Alcalde D. Bhatt H. Anver M. Bhat N. Nagashima K. Stewart C.L. Burke B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 15Nikolova V. Leimena C. McMahon A.C.

However, there is a paucity of data on the structural properties of the nuclear lamina and how different lamins might contribute to the structural properties of the nuclear lamina. In this study, we have taken advantage of the existence of genetically modified mice (and fibroblast and myoblast cell lines derived from them) to understand the roles of specific lamin proteins in nuclear mechanical stiffness and fragility and in cell viability.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells—Lmna-deficient (Lmna-/-), Lmna heterozygous (Lmna+/-), and wild-type (Lmna+/+) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) 3The abbreviations used are: MEFs, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; HBSS, Hanks' buffered saline solution; EFC, elliptic Fourier coefficient; RFP, red fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein. were cultured from embryos derived from Lmna+/- intercrosses (14Sullivan T. Escalante-Alcalde D. Bhatt H. Anver M. Bhat N. Nagashima K. Stewart C.L. Burke B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Similarly, lamin C-only (LmnaLCO/LCO and LmnaLCO/+) and wild-type control MEFs were derived from the offspring of LmnaLCO/+ intercrosses. LmnaLCO/- MEFs were obtained by intercrossing LmnaLCO/+ and Lmna+/- mice. Cells lacking wild-type lamin B1 (Lmnb1Δ/Δ) express a fusion protein consisting of roughly the first half of lamin B1 and βgeo; the lamin B1 fusion protein lacks several crucial functional domains of lamin B1 (e.g. a large portion of the rod domain and the C-terminal globular domain, including the CAAX (where A is an aliphatic amino acid) motif that triggers farnesylation) (18Vergnes L. Peterfy M. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Reue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10428-10433Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). For each genotype, we used at least two independently derived lines of MEFs. MEFs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone), nonessential amino acids, 2-mercaptoethanol, and penicillin/streptomycin. Experiments were performed both on primary MEFs and on MEFs that had been immortalized by repeated passages. Primary and immortalized MEFs invariably showed the same phenotypes, but cell-to-cell variations were smaller in the immortalized cell lines. Accordingly, unless specified otherwise, the experiments were performed with immortalized MEFs. Skeletal myoblasts were derived from the fore and hind limbs of 4-6-week-old Lmna+/+ and Lmna-/- mice as described previously (24Melcon G. Kozlov S. Cutler D.A. Sullivan T. Hernandez L. Zhao P. Mitchell S. Nader G. Bakay M. Rottman J.N. Hoffman E.P. Stewart C.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Myoblasts were cultured on gelatin-coated dishes in Ham's F-10 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1.26 mm Ca2+, 20% horse serum, 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (R&D Systems), and penicillin/streptomycin. Proliferating myoblasts were refed daily with fresh growth medium. Differentiation was induced by growth factor withdrawal.Western Analysis of Nuclear Proteins—Cells were grown to confluency and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (all from Sigma) or alternatively in 9 m urea buffer supplemented with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture. Protein extracts were size-fractionated on 4-12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen) with MOPS running buffer; transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes; and incubated with antibodies against lamins A and C (catalog no. sc-6215, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), lamin B1 (catalog no. sc-6217, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), lamin B2 (rabbit polyclonal antibody kindly provided by Dr. Larry Gerace), α-tubulin (catalog no. sc-5286, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and actin (catalog no. A-2066, Sigma).Nuclear Shape Analysis—To quantify the fraction of irregularly shaped nuclei or nuclei containing blebs, MEFs at various passages were incubated for 15 min with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain (Molecular Probes) and washed with Hanks' buffered saline solution (HBSS; Invitrogen). For each passage, fluorescent images of ≈100-400 randomly selected nuclei were acquired at ×20 magnification on an Olympus IX-70 microscope with a digital camera and stored for subsequent image analysis (19Lammerding J. Hsiao J. Schulze P.C. Kozlov S. Stewart C.L. Lee R.T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Nuclei were scored as normal, as irregularly shaped (deviation from an oval or spherical shape), or as containing blebs. These determinations were made by an observer blinded to genotype. For quantitative nuclear morphometric analyses, the nuclear cross-sectional area and perimeter were measured in midsections of the fluorescently labeled nuclei with custom-written MATLAB software and used to compute the nuclear contour ratio (4π × area/perimeter2) (25Goldman R.D. Shumaker D.K. Erdos M.R. Eriksson M. Goldman A.E. Gordon L.B. Gruenbaum Y. Khuon S. Mendez M. Varga R. Collins F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8963-8968Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The contour ratio reaches a maximum value of 1 for a circle and decreases with increasingly convoluted nuclear shapes. In addition, elliptic Fourier analysis was used for a more detailed analysis of nuclear contour using custom-written MATLAB software to automatically trace the outline of fluorescently labeled nuclei and to compute the first 20 elliptic harmonics, where each single elliptic harmonic can be geometrically visualized as a pair of orthogonal semiaxes (19Lammerding J. Hsiao J. Schulze P.C. Kozlov S. Stewart C.L. Lee R.T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 26Diaz G. Zuccarelli A. Pelligra I. Ghiani A. Comput. Biomed. Res. 1989; 22: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For the nuclear shape analysis, we defined the elliptic Fourier coefficient (EFC) ratio as the ratio of the sum of the first major and minor semiaxes to the sum of the higher order semiaxes as a metric of irregular nuclear shape, where the first-order harmonic coefficients can be visualized as describing an ellipsoidal shape and higher order harmonic coefficients are necessary to fit more convoluted outlines.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were plated on LabTek chamber slides (Nunc), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. After blocking, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-lamin B, anti-lamin A/C, anti-emerin (Abcam), and anti-β-tubulin (Sigma)) or Oregon Green 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes), followed by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to Cy3 (Sigma) or Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes). Subsequently, fixed cells were imaged on an Olympus IX-70 microscope at ×40 (numerical aperture of 1.15) or ×63 (numerical aperture of 1.4) magnification on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Perinuclear cytoskeletal structure was scored by an observer blinded for genotype as either normal or abnormal (e.g. fragmented actin filaments or sparse microtubule network).Time-lapse Experiments—To quantify dynamic changes in nuclear shape, we performed time-lapse video microscopy (19Lammerding J. Hsiao J. Schulze P.C. Kozlov S. Stewart C.L. Lee R.T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on 35-mm polystyrene cell culture dishes (Corning) and grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C for at least 24 h prior to the start of experiments. Subsequently, culture dishes were sealed with Parafilm M and placed at room temperature on the microscope stage. After a brief equilibration period, images were automatically acquired every 5 min for a minimum of 8 h, 20 min (100 frames), at ×20 magnification with a digital CCD camera. Continued cell viability was confirmed by monitoring the cells for 24 h. Nuclear shape changes, rotation, and translation were analyzed by tracking the centroid positions of three to six nucleoli for each nucleus with custom-written MATLAB software. For each frame, the linear conformal image transformation that best mapped the current centroid positions to the original positions was computed, minimizing the least-square error. The linear conformal transformations can account for a combination of translation, rotation, and scaling, and this method preserves the relative position of objects to each other. The deviation from the best fit (i.e. the error between the least-square fit transformation and the actual nucleolus positions) was used as a measure of nuclear deformation, as it describes the extent of nuclear deformation from the initial shape independent of absolute nuclear movement or uniform changes in size (see supplemental Videos 1-4). Nucleoli that fused over time or cells that died or underwent mitosis during or immediately following the observation period were excluded from the analysis. We analyzed at least 23 nuclei of each cell type, and we computed for each nucleus the time-averaged deformation and the time-averaged and maximum change in size.Nuclear Strain Experiments—Nuclear strain studies were performed as described previously (19Lammerding J. Hsiao J. Schulze P.C. Kozlov S. Stewart C.L. Lee R.T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 20Lammerding J. Schulze P.C. Takahashi T. Kozlov S. Sullivan T. Kamm R.D. Stewart C.L. Lee R.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were plated on fibronectin-coated silicone membranes in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, followed by serum starvation for 48 h in DMEM containing insulin, transferrin, and selenium supplements (Sigma) to minimize the number of mitotic nuclei. Preceding the strain experiments, cells were incubated with Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain (final concentration of 1 μg/ml) in DMEM containing insulin, transferrin, and selenium supplements for 15 min and subsequently kept in HBSS. Membranes were placed on a custom-made strain device, and uniform biaxial strain was applied to the silicone membrane. Membrane and nuclear strains were computed based on bright-field and fluorescent images acquired before, during, and after strain application with a custom image analysis algorithm. Normalized nuclear strain was defined as the ratio of nuclear strain to membrane strain to compensate for small variations in applied membrane strain. The percent membrane strain was 4.76 ± 0.37 (mean ± S.D.). The myoblasts experiments were carried out analogously to the fibroblast experiments. Myoblasts were plated on fibronectin-coated silicone membranes and allowed to differentiate for 5 days prior to the start of the experiments, resulting in large multinucleated myotubes (see Fig. 7).Lmna-/- Rescue Experiments—Lmna-/- MEFs were transfected with expression plasmids coding for prelamin A-red fluorescent protein (RFP), green fluorescent protein (GFP)-lamin B1, or GFP-lamin C with GeneJammer transfection reagent (Stratagene). The next day, cells were replated on fibronectin-coated silicone membranes and, following 48 h of serum starvation, used for nuclear strain experiments. Additional aliquots of transfected cells were replated on 35-mm polystyrene dishes or LabTek chamber slides and imaged 1-3 days after transfection.Cell Viability and Apoptosis Assays—Experiments to measure cell viability under prolonged strain application were carried out as described previously (19Lammerding J. Hsiao J. Schulze P.C. Kozlov S. Stewart C.L. Lee R.T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 20Lammerding J. Schulze P.C. Takahashi T. Kozlov S. Sullivan T. Kamm R.D. Stewart C.L. Lee R.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on fibronectin-coated silicone membranes and maintained in full medium for 1-3 days. Following 24 h of cyclic biaxial strain (1 Hz, 10% strain), cells were incubated for 15 min with propidium iodide (final concentration of 1 μg/ml; Sigma). The cells and culture medium were collected, washed once with HBSS, and resuspended in HBSS. Each sample was divided into two equal parts to measure cell death (propidium iodide uptake) and apoptosis (DNA content analysis). One part was immediately analyzed for propidium iodide uptake with a flow cytometer (Cytomics FC500, Beckman Coulter), counting 30,000-50,000 events in each group. Thresholds for propidium iodide incorporation were determined based on a negative control (no propidium iodide staining) and a positive control (propidium iodide staining after permeabilization with 50% ethanol). The other cell fraction was fixed in 80% ethanol and stored at -20 °C. Samples were subsequently spun down, resuspended in calcium- and magnesium-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen), treated with ribonuclease A (Sigma) for 30 min, and stained for 15 min with propidium iodide (final concentration of 100 μg/ml). DNA content was measured with a flow cytometer (counting 30,000-50,000 events/sample), and apoptotic cells were identified as those with sub-G1 DNA content (27Walker P.R. Kwast-Welfeld J. Gourdeau H. Leblanc J. Neugebauer W. Sikorska M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Image Acquisition and Manipulation—Phase-contrast and fluorescent images were acquired with a CoolSNAPHQ digital CCD camera (Photometrics) mounted on an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope with Image-Pro image acquisition software (Media Cybernetics). Nuclear shape experiments and time-lapse studies were imaged with an Olympus LCPlanFl ×20 phase-contrast objective (numerical aperture of 0.40), whereas nuclear strain experiments were conducted with an Olympus LCPlanFl ×60 objective (numerical aperture of 0.70). Cells were kept in HBSS during imaging, except for time-lapse experiments, in which the cells were kept in complete medium. All experiments were carried out at room temperature.Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed at least three times. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with Prism 3.0 and InStat software (GraphPad Software). The data were analyzed by unpaired Student's t test (allowing different S.D. values) for comparison between two groups; by one-way analysis of variance (followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test) for three or more groups; or, in cases of non-gaussian distribution, by the Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis test (the latter when comparing more than two groups, always with Dunn's multiple comparison post-test). For nuclear shape analyses, we compared mean values from at least three different passages (counting ≈200 nuclei each) by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test for some comparisons (e.g. Lmna+/+ versus Lmna+/- versus Lmna-/- and LmnaLCO/LCO versus LmnaLCO/+ versus Lmna+/+), whereas we applied a paired t test for comparisons of Lmnb1Δ/Δ and Lmnb1+/+ cells. Histograms for quantitative nuclear shape parameters were based on pooled results from several passage numbers, and median values were compared by non-parametric one-way analysis of variance for certain comparisons (Lmna-/- versus Lmna+/- versus Lmna+/+ and LmnaLCO/LCO versus LmnaLCO/+ versus Lmna+/+) and by the Mann-Whitney test for others (Lmnb1+/+ versus Lmnb1Δ/Δ). Multiple regression analysis was carried out on 16 of the 21 different cell lines for which nuclear strain results and Western analysis results were available (supplemental Table 1). Normalized nuclear strain was used as the outcome, and the expression levels of lamins A, B1, B2, and C relative to levels in wild-type cells were used as the variables. Even though multicollinearity analysis showed that the variables were independent of each other, we tested only regression models that used a single variable (e.g. lamin A) at a time. For all experiments, a two-tailed p value of <0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSLoss of Specific Lamins Does Not Affect Protein Levels of Other Lamins—We analyzed the function of specific lamins in nuclear shape, stability, and stiffness in wild-type MEFs and in MEFs lacking lamin A (designated lamin C-only or LmnaLCO/LCO cells) (16Fong L.G. Ng J.K. Lammerding J. Vickers T.A. Meta M. Cote N. Gavino B. Qiao X. Chang S.Y. Young S.R. Yang S.H. Stewart C.L. Lee R.T. Bennett C.F. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), in MEFs deficient in both lamins A and C (Lmna-/-) (14Sullivan T. Escalante-Alcalde D. Bhatt H. Anver M. Bhat N. Nagashima K. Stewart C.L. Burke B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar), and in MEFs expressing a severely truncated mutant form of lamin B1 (Lmnb1Δ/Δ) that lacks several crucial functional domains of lamin B1 (e.g. a large portion of the rod domain and the C-terminal globular domain with the CAAX motif that triggers farnesylation) (18Vergnes L. Peterfy M. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Reue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10428-10433Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To determine whether the loss of specific lamins leads to compensatory up-regulation of the expression of other lamins, we performed Western analysis on whole cell lysates (Fig. 1). As expected, Lmna-/- MEFs lacked all A-type lamins, whereas Lmna+/- MEFs had reduced levels of lamins A and C (Fig. 1A). Expression of B-type lamins was not significantly perturbed in Lmna-/- or Lmna+/- MEFs. LmnaLCO/LCO cells did not express lamin A but expressed increased levels of lamin C (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, LmnaLCO/LCO MEFs had significantly increased expression of lamin B2 and showed a trend toward increased levels of lamin B1 (Fig. 1B). In Lmnb1Δ/Δ MEFs, lamin B1 was absent, as expected, whereas expression of lamins A, C, and B2 appeared to be normal (Fig. 1C). We did observe some variability in lamin protein levels in different cell lines of a single genotype, but this type of variability is known to occur with differences in cell cycle or quiescence state (28Pugh G.E.

https://openalex.org/W2010110193,"Autotaxin (ATX) is a cancer-associated motogen that has multiple biological activities in vitro through the production of bioactive small lipids, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). ATX and LPA are abundantly present in circulating blood. However, their roles in circulation remain to be solved. To uncover the physiological role of ATX we analyzed ATX knock-out mice. In ATX-null embryos, early blood vessels appeared to form properly, but they failed to develop into mature vessels. As a result ATX-null mice are lethal around embryonic day 10.5. The phenotype is much more severe than those of LPA receptor knock-out mice reported so far. In cultured allantois explants, neither ATX nor LPA was angiogenic. However, both of them helped to maintain preformed vessels by preventing disassembly of the vessels that was not antagonized by Ki16425, an LPA receptor antagonist. In serum from heterozygous mice both lysophospholipase D activity and LPA level were about half of those from wild-type mice, showing that ATX is responsible for the bulk of LPA production in serum. The present study revealed a previously unassigned role of ATX in stabilizing vessels through novel LPA signaling pathways.

Autotaxin (ATX) 2The abbreviations used are: ATX, autotaxin; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; PECAM, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule; E, embryonic day; lysoPLD, lysophospholipase D; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR. is a motogen-like phosphodiesterase originally isolated from conditioned medium of human melanoma cells (1Stracke M.L.

Enforced expression of ATX in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells greatly enhances their invasive, tumorigenic, and metastatic potentials (2Nam S.W. Clair T. Campo C.K. Lee H.Y. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition, enhanced expression of ATX has been demonstrated in various malignant tumor tissues (3Mills G.B. Moolenaar W.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Thus, ATX is implicated in tumorigenic and metastatic potentials of cancer cells. ATX is also expressed in various tissues and is present at high concentration in various biological fluids including plasma, serum, and seminal plasma (4Aoki J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), implying specific roles of ATX in circulation. Recently, ATX was shown to have lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD) activity, which converts lysophosphatidylcholine to a bioactive lysophospholipid, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (5Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 6Tokumura A. Majima E. Kariya Y. Tominaga K. Kogure K. Yasuda K. Fukuzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39436-39442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). ATX also converts sphingosylphosphorylcholine into another bioactive lysophospholipid, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in vitro (7Clair T. Aoki J. Koh E. Bandle R.W. Nam S.W. Ptaszynska M.M. Mills G.B. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5446-5453PubMed Google Scholar). Because LPA and S1P are regulators of cell motility and proliferation in various cell systems, they might be the effectors of the motogenic actions of ATX. LPA and S1P have been shown to have diverse roles in many biological processes that are mediated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) specific to LPA or S1P; there are five GPCRs for LPA (LPA1-5) and five for S1P (S1P1-5) with a number of putative GPCRs (8Ishii I. Fukushima N. Ye X. Chun J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 321-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Thus, ATX may exert its functions through these receptors. Indeed, ATX stimulates cell motility of tumor cells through one of the LPA receptors, LPA1 (9Hama K. Aoki J. Fukaya M. Kishi Y. Sakai T. Suzuki R. Ohta H. Yamori T. Watanabe M. Chun J. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17634-17639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and ATX positively or negatively modulates cell motility depending on S1P receptor subtypes (7Clair T. Aoki J. Koh E. Bandle R.W. Nam S.W. Ptaszynska M.M. Mills G.B. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5446-5453PubMed Google Scholar, 10Takuwa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To uncover the physiological role of ATX and to identify the endogenous product of ATX, we investigated ATX knock-out mice. In this study we show that ATX produces LPA, but not S1P, in circulating blood and that it contributes to blood vessel stability through novel LPA signaling pathways. ATX Knock-out Mice—ATX knock-out mice (atx-/-) in the genetic background 129/SvEvBrd were produced by and obtained from Lexicon Genetics (The Woodlands, TX). The ATX gene was targeted with an ATX gene-targeting vector, which was designed to replace the initiation codon and first 45 amino acids encoded by exons 1 and 2 with a lacZ-neo cassette in the vector pKOS (Fig. 1A). The ATX knock-out mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6j mice at least six times before being used. Mice were genotyped by both Southern blotting and PCR of genomic DNA. The PCR primers for detection of wild-type alleles are 5′-ccgaatctctccgatcactac-3′ and 5′-tccaacattaaagcgataacc-3′, and those for detection of mutant alleles are 5′-gcagcgcatcgccttctatc-3′ and 5′-tccaacattaaagcgataacc-3′. Flk-1-laxZ knock-in mice (11Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar) were kindly donated by Dr. Janet Rossant (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). All mice used in this study were bred and maintained at the Animal Care Facility in the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, the University of Tokyo, under specific pathogen-free conditions in accordance with institutional guidelines. Recombinant ATX—Two recombinant mouse ATX proteins (wild-type ATX and catalytically inactive T209A mutant ATX) with a His tag at the N terminus were expressed and purified using a baculovirus system and nickel column chromatography (HisTrap HP; GE Healthcare), respectively. Preparation of ATX-depleted Serum—To establish anti-mouse ATX monoclonal antibody, the recombinant mouse ATX protein (50 μg) was used to immunize rats (WKY/Izm strain) with Freund's complete adjuvant into the hind footpads. Cells from the enlarged medial iliac and inguinal lymph nodes were fused with mouse myeloma (PAI) cells. The antibody-secreting hybridoma cells were selected by screening with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoprecipitation. One clone (5E5 (rat IgG1)) was found to have activity to immunoprecipitate ATX in mouse serum. 5E5 reacted with mouse, human, and bovine ATX but does not react with rat ATX. The monoclonal antibody was purified from culture supernatant of hybridoma cells and was coupled to Sepharose 4B beads (2 mg/ml) (GE Healthcare). To deplete ATX from mouse serum, mouse serum (1 ml) was incubated with the 5E5-Sepahrose 4B (40 μl)for 2 h at 4 °C,andthe resulting supernatant was used for measuring lysoPLD activity and LPA production. ATX bound to the 5E5-Sepahrose 4B was eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5. This gave rise to a single 100-kDa band on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, showing that 5E5 is specific to ATX. Immunohistochemistry, Whole-mount Immunostaining, and Whole-mount LacZ Staining—Tissue sections (5 μm) were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, incubated in 3% (v/v) H2O2 for 20 min, incubated overnight at 4 °C with first antibodies (EPOS anti-a-SMA/HRP; DAKO), stained with diaminobenzidine according to the manufacturer's protocol, and counter-stained with hematoxylin. For whole-mount embryo immuno-staining, embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, incubated with 5% hydrogen peroxide in methanol, rehydrated through a methanol series to phosphate-buffered saline, incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100, incubated with rat anti-PECAM monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (American Qualex), and stained with diaminobenzidine as a peroxidase substrate. LacZ staining was performed as described (11Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). Allantois Culture—Allantoides were dissected from embryos at E8.5 and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing glutamine and antibiotics (18Argraves W.S. Larue A.C. Fleming P.A. Drake C.J. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To perform the vessel formation, the allantois explants were cultured for 24 h (37 °C; 5% CO2) in the presence or absence of the factors tested. In some cases, to examine the effect of factors on stabilization of preformed vessels the allantoides were first cultured for 24 h in the presence of amniotic fluids (isolated from E12.5 embryos) to allow formation of stable vascular networks and then cultured for an additional 18 h in the presence or absence of the factors tested. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then immunostained with anti-PECAM monoclonal antibody. Determination of LPA and S1P Concentration, lysoPLD Activity, and Western Blotting—LPA and S1P concentrations in plasma and serum were determined as described previously (12Kishimoto T. Matsuoka T. Imamura S. Mizuno K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2003; 333: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Yatomi Y. Ruan F. Ohta J. Welch R.J. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Anal.

Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Western blotting of ATX was performed as described using ATX-specific monoclonal antibody (15Tanaka M. Kishi Y. Takanezawa Y. Kakehi Y. Aoki J. Arai H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In Situ Hybridization—Expression of ATX and LPA1 was detected in paraffin-embedded or frozen sections by in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes for ATX and LPA1 as previously described (16Iseki S. Wilkie A.O. Heath J.K. Ishimaru T. Eto K. Morriss K.G. Development. 1997; 124: 3375-3384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specimens were treated with proteinase K at 2 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min and then refixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, followed by acetylation. Finally, digoxigenin was immunodetected with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Applied Science). Quantitative RT-PCR—From embryos and yolk sacs at E8.5-E10.5, total RNA was isolated using ISOGEN (Nippongene, Toyama, Japan) and reverse transcribed using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Primers used to detect ATX, LPA receptors, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and β-actin were described previously (17Kishi Y. Okudaira S. Tanaka M. Hama K. Shida D. Kitayama J. Yamori T. Aoki J. Fujimaki T. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17492-17500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described (9Hama K. Aoki J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 17634-17639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) using ABI PRISM7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was normalized to the number of β-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcripts. Vascular Defects in ATX-null Embryos—To understand the physiological role of ATX, we investigated atx knock-out mice. The ATX gene was targeted with an ATX gene-targeting vector that was designed to replace the initiation codon and first 45 amino acids encoded by exons 1 and 2 with a lacZ-neo cassette in the vector pKOS (Fig. 1A). The generation of mutant mice was confirmed by Southern blotting (not shown) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses of tail genomic DNA (Fig. 1B). RT-PCR analysis of embryos carrying the knock-out allele confirmed that ATX mRNA was not produced from the disrupted locus (Fig. 1C). The plasma lysoPLD activity and plasma ATX protein level in atx+/- mice were about half the values found in atx+/+ mice (Fig. 2, A and B), showing that ATX is responsible for most of the lysoPLD activity in plasma. The plasma LPA concentrations in atx+/- mice were about half of those in atx+/+ mice (Fig. 3A). In addition, in ATX-depleted mouse serum, which is prepared by mixing the mouse serum with Sepharose 4B beads coupled with anti-ATX monoclonal antibody (5E5), both lysoPLD activity and LPA production during incubation at 37 °C were hardly detected (Fig. 3, B and C). These results clearly indicate that ATX is a major enzyme that produces LPA in serum. By contrast, the S1P levels in plasma (Fig. 3D) and serum (not shown) from atx+/+ mice were unchanged. Despite the reduced LPA level, heterozygous mice appeared phenotypically normal. Viability and fecundity were similar to those in wild-type mice.FIGURE 3ATX is responsible for bulk LPA production in plasma. A, LPA levels in plasma from atx+/+ and atx+/- mice determined by a coloriometric method. Plasma LPA levels were reduced by about one half in atx+/- mice.

D, S1P level in plasma from atx+/+ and atx+/- mice. Plasma S1P levels were not significantly different. Statistical significance was analyzed using Student's t test. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) are indicated by asterisks in panels A and B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Intercrossing of heterozygous animals produced no homozygous pups, indicating that ATX mutations are recessive embryonic lethal. To determine when homozygous embryos were dying, embryos were isolated at various stages of gestation. Homozygous embryos survived at least to embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) (Table 1). From E9.5, homozygous embryos were clearly abnormal, and at E11.5 almost all of them were dead in utero. Several defects were evident in the homozygous embryo proper. These included growth retardation, open and kinky neural tubes, pericardial effusion, reduced number of somites, incomplete turning, pallor, and fragility (Fig. 4). The hearts beat until E10.5, but contractions were weak and irregular. In addition, yolk sacs were apparently abnormal in homozygous (atx-/-) embryos. The yolk sac of atx-/- embryos completely lacked large vitelline vessels at E9.5 and E10.5, whereas wild-type (atx+/+) yolk sacs had well developed vitelline vessels (Fig. 5A). Histological analysis also showed a clear difference in morphology between atx+/+ and atx-/- tissues. Individual vessels were clearly visible in atx+/+ tissue, with numerous regularly spaced attachments between the visceral endoderm and mesoderm layers (Fig. 5A). Visceral endoderm and mesoderm were more widely separated in atx-/- tissue, with occasional attachments forming numerous large spaces that were sparsely populated with blood cells (Fig. 5A). Despite the vascular defects, embryonic erythrocytes were present (Fig. 5A, arrows), indicating that blood cells differentiated. To specifically visualize the endothelial vasculature in the developing yolk sac and embryo, we utilized flk-1 heterozygous mice, in which expression of lacZ is regulated by the promoter of the flk-1 gene and is restricted to endothelial cells (11Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). We generated atx+/+flk+/- and atx-/-flk+/- embryos with flk-1 promoter-regulated lacZ expression. To do this we first crossed atx+/- mice with flk+/- (flk.LacZ) mice and generated atx+/-flk+/-. Then atx+/+flk+/- and atx-/-flk+/- embryos were generated by crossing atx+/-flk+/- mice. At E8.5, atx-/-flk+/- yolk sacs had slightly rough but almost comparable tubular structures to atx+/+flk+/- yolk sacs (Fig. 5B). In contrast, at E9.5, atx-/-flk+/- yolk sacs were found to have severe vascular defects, i.e. they had no well developed fine blood vessels (Fig. 5B). Consistent with this observation, both normal and abnormal vessels were visible in atx-/-flk+/- yolk sacs at E9.0 (Fig. 5B). Embryos at E8.5 atx-/- had vascular defects in the head (arrows) and cardiac (sinus venosus) regions but not in the dorsal aortae (Fig. 5B). Staining with antibodies against PECAM, another endothelial cell-specific marker, confirmed the vascular defects of the yolk sac in homozygous embryos (not shown). Incomplete vascular remodeling was also observed in the embryo proper. Whole-mount anti-PECAM staining revealed well developed thin and fine tubule-like structures in atx+/+ embryos (Fig. 5C). In sharp contrast, the structures were thick and irregular-shaped in atx-/- embryos (Fig. 5C). At E9.5, the atx+/+ placenta had both embryonic and maternal blood vessels (distinguishable by the size of their erythrocytes), whereas the atx-/- placenta had only maternal blood vessels (Fig. 5D). At E9.5, chorioallantoic attachment and fusion were observed both in atx+/+ and atx-/- embryos (Fig. 5E). However, it was evident that atx-/- allantois lacked the numerous vessel lumen visible in the atx+/+ allantois (Fig. 5E). Immunostaining of the yolk sac and embryo proper at E9.5 with anti-α-smooth muscle actin, a specific marker of vascular smooth muscle cells, showed that smooth muscle cells were present and surrounded the endothelial cells in both the yolk sac (Fig. 5F) and embryo proper (not shown). This indicates that mural cell investment is not the cause of vascular defects in atx-/- embryos. These analyses suggest that initial blood vessel formation occurs properly in atx-/- embryos but the newly formed blood vessels fail to develop into mature vessels in the absence of ATX.TABLE 1Genotype distributions of offspring of atx+/- intercrosses at different stages of developmentStage of developmentNumber of littersTotal number of embryos testedNumbers of embryo or neonateEmbryo resorption+/++/——/—E8.57651435160E9.58741936190E10.57622229113E11.5433112209E12.5174303E13.521531203E14.5163301Neonate94515300— Open table in a new tab FIGURE 5Defects in vascular remodeling in atx-/- embryos.

In situ hybridization experiments detected weak expression in endodermal cells that surround the yolk sac at E8.5 (Fig. 6B). By contrast, significant ATX protein expression was observed in amniotic fluids in all embryonic stages tested, and its level was nearly equivalent to the plasma level as judged by both Western blotting and lysoPLD activity (Fig. 2, A and C). As was observed in plasma, the lysoPLD activity and ATX protein in amniotic fluids from atx+/- embryos at E11.5, 12.5, and 13.5 were almost half the value found in atx+/+ embryos (Fig. 2, A and C). Western blot analysis also showed that ATX expression was not detectable in either yolk sac or embryo proper at E9.5, although ATX protein was highly expressed in amniotic fluids (Fig. 2, D and E). These analyses indicate that most of the ATX proteins produced in embryos are released and concentrated in amniotic fluids. ATX and LPA Prevent Disassembly of Vessels in Allatois Culture System—To determine the role of ATX and to assess its enzymatic activity in vascular remodeling, we utilized the allantois explant culture system (18Argraves W.S. Larue A.C. Fleming P.A. Drake C.J. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As reported by Argraves et al. (18Argraves W.S. Larue A.C. Fleming P.A. Drake C.J. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), when E8.5 allantois explants were cultured in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, a highly branched network of PECAM-positive vessels was visible after 24 h of culture (Fig. 7A). The amniotic fluids isolated from E12.5 wild-type embryos were found to have a similar but an even more pronounced effect on vessel formation than fetal calf serum (Fig. 7A). Allantois explants from atx-/- embryos also showed a highly branched network of PECAM-positive vessels when they were cultured in the presence of amniotic fluids isolated from E12.5 wild-type embryos (Fig. 7A) or fetal calf serum (not shown). Adding LPA or recombinant ATX to this system had little effect on vessel formation (Fig. 7A), showing that ATX and LPA themselves are not angiogenic. In the presence of amniotic fluids, the vessels that formed within the first 24 h of culture kept their tubular structure during the next 18 h of culture (Fig. 7B). However, in the absence of amniotic fluid, the preformed nascent vessels were unstable and disassembled (Fig. 7B). The recombinant ATX, but not catalytically inactive ATX, prevented the disassembly (Fig. 7B). LPA also prevented the disassembly of preformed vessels, whereas S1P had no effect (Fig. 7B). These results indicate that ATX in the amniotic fluids has a role in stabilizing vessels. To know the molecular mechanisms of how LPA stabilizes blood vessels, we examined the expression of LPA receptors. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization experiments showed that among the four LPA receptors LPA1 is predominantly expressed in the yolk sac and embryo proper at E8.5, E9.5, and E10.5 (Fig. 6C), where it is expressed by cells in the endodermal layer other than endothelial cells (Fig. 6D). Expression levels of LPA2, LPA3, and LPA4 were revealed to be low. Thus, we tested the effect of an LPA receptor antagonist, Ki16425, on the vessel-stabilizing effect of ATX and LPA. The Ki values of Ki16425 are 0.25 μm for LPA1, 5.6 μm for LPA2, and 0.36 μm for LPA3 (19Ohta H. Sato K. Murata N. Damirin A. Malchinkhuu E. Kon J. Kimura T. Tobo M. Yamazaki Y. Watanabe T. Yagi M. Sato M. Suzuki R. Murooka H. Sakai T. Nishitoba T. Im D.S. Nochi H. Tamoto K. Tomura H. Okajima F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 994-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Ki16425 did not show antagonistic activity toward LPA4 (19Ohta H. Sato K. Murata N. Damirin A. Malchinkhuu E. Kon J. Kimura T. Tobo M. Yamazaki Y. Watanabe T. Yagi M. Sato M. Suzuki R. Murooka H. Sakai T. Nishitoba T. Im D.S. Nochi H. Tamoto K. Tomura H. Okajima F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 994-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Adding Ki16425 at 5 μm in the allantois culture system did not affect the vessel-stabilizing effects of ATX and LPA (Fig. 8). Thus, it is unlikely that LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3 are involved in the vessel-stabilizing effect of ATX and LPA. ATX was originally identified as a cell motility-stimulating factor for cancer cells (1Stracke M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Unsworth E.J. Arestad A. Cioce V. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2524-2529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, ATX was found to have enzymatic activity to produce a bioactive phospholipid, LPA (5Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A.

LPA has been defined as a growth factor-like lipid with numerous biological activities, including stimulation of cell motility (3Mills G.B. Moolenaar W.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). In this study to elucidate the physiological role of ATX we analyzed ATX knock-out mice. To our surprise ATX knock-out mice were embryonic lethal, showing that ATX is indispensable for embryonic development. Blood vessel formation was severely affected in ATX-null embryos, suggesting novel roles of ATX and LPA in the formation of blood vessels in the embryonic stage. In addition, the present study confirmed that ATX is responsible for bulk LPA production in blood, but not for S1P production. The phenotype of ATX-null embryos was quite different from those of LPA receptors reported so far (21Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Weiner J.A. Kaushal D. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13384-13389Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 22Contos J.J. Ishii I. Fukushima N. Kingsbury M.A. Ye X. Kawamura S. Brown J.H. Chun J. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 2005; 435: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). These results raise a possibility that ATX and LPA contribute to embryonic blood vessel formation through as yet unidentified LPA receptors. Nam et al. (24Nam S.W. Clair T. Kim Y.S. McMarlin A. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6938-6944PubMed Google Scholar) reported that injection of Matrigel mixed with purified ATX into athymic nude mice resulted in new blood vessel formation within the plug and that ATX stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells grown on Matrigel to form tubules. From these results they suggested that ATX was an angiogenic factor. Our present data suggest that ATX itself is not angiogenic but it stabilizes preformed vessels through an unknown mechanism. Because Matrigel contains several factors that promote vessel formation, ATX may contribute to the vessel formation possibly in cooperation with such factors. The formation of vasculature by vasculogenesis and angiogenesis is essential not only for embryonic development but also for the unrestrained growth of tumors (25Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7218) Google Scholar). ATX stimulates both cell proliferation and cell motility of cancer cells through LPA production (5Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A.

In addition, overexpression of ATX is frequently associated with malignant tumors such as small cell lung cancer (26Yang Y. Mou L.J. Liu N. Tsao M.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), renal cell cancer (27Stassar M.J. Devitt G. Brosius M. Rinnab L. Prang J. Schradin T. Simon J. Petersen S. Kopp S.A. Zoller M. Br.

Chem. 2006; 281: 17492-17500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Thus, ATX has been implicated in the progression of malignant tumors. In this study we showed that ATX has an additional role in blood vessel formation, possibly by stabilizing preformed blood vessels. The present study raises the possibility that ATX, in addition to stimulating proliferation and motility of tumor cells (5Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), contributes to the progression of tumors by stabilizing blood vessels in the vicinity of tumors. ATX is capable of producing S1P because ATX also catalyzes a reaction to convert sphingosylphosphocholine to S1P (7Clair T. Aoki J. Koh E. Bandle R.W. Nam S.W. Ptaszynska M.M. Mills G.B. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5446-5453PubMed Google Scholar). We showed in this study that ATX is a major producing enzyme for LPA, but not for S1P, in blood. It is accepted in recent reports that S1P is produced intracellularly from sphingosine through phosphorylation reaction mediated by two isozymes of sphingosine kinase (sphK) (sphingosine kinase 1 and sphingosine kinase 2) (34Allende M.L. Sasaki T. Kawai H. Olivera A. Mi Y. van Echten-Deckert G. Hajdu R. Rosenbach M. Keohane C.A. Mandala S. Spiegel S. Proia R.L. J. Biol.

Interestingly, vascular defects were also observed in sphingosine kinase-null and S1P receptor-null embryos. Both sphk1-/-,sphk2-/- double mutant embryos (36Mizugishi K. Yamashita T. Olivera A. Miller G.F. Spiegel S. Proia R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 11113-11121Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) and s1p1-/-,s1p2-/-, s1p3-/- triple mutant embryos (37Kono M. Mi Y. Liu Y.

Thus, despite their similar structures, LPA and S1P have distinct synthetic pathways, targets, and functions. Among the four LPA receptors reported so far, LPA1 is predominantly expressed in embryos around E9.5, whereas LPA2, LPA3, and LPA4 are weakly expressed (Fig. 6, C and D). We showed that Ki16425, an antagonist for LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3, had little effect on vessel-stabilizing activity of ATX and LPA (Fig. 8). Thus, it is unlikely that LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3 are involved in this process. Consistent with this, phenotypes of LPA receptor knock-out mice are quite different from that of ATX knock-out mice. LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3 single and LPA1 and LPA2 double knock-out mice are reported to be viable (21Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Weiner J.A. Kaushal D. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 2005; 435: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). LPA also exerts its role through other targets such as GPR23/LPA4 (38Noguchi K. Ishii S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25600-25606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Very recently a novel G protein-coupled receptor, GPR92/LPA5, was identified as a fifth cellular receptor for LPA (39Lee C.W. Rivera R. Gardell S. Dubin A.E. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; (June 14)10.1074/jbc.M603670200Google Scholar, 40Kotarsky K. Boketoft A. Bristulf J. Nilsson N.E. Norberg A. Hansson S. Sillard R. Owman C. Leeb-Lundberg F.L. Olde B. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

It is possible that ATX exerts its role in blood vessel stabilization through these newly identified LPA receptors via signaling pathways independent of classical LPA receptors (LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3).

This induction required an intact competence regulatory cascade. Furthermore, mitomycin C induction of recA was strictly dependent on the development of competence. In response to antibiotic stress, S. pneumoniae , which lacks an SOS-like system, exhibited genetic transformation. The design of antibiotherapy should take into consideration this potential of a major human pathogen to increase its rate of genetic exchange in response to antibiotics."

In lipid vesicles containing quinone as electron acceptors and surrounded by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as hole acceptors, transmembrane proton gradients arose through quinone reduction upon excitation with visible light. Quantitative ultrafast and relatively long-lived charge separation was confirmed as the origin of photosynthetic activity by femtosecond fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy. Supramolecular self-organization was essential in that photoactivity was lost upon rod shortening (from p -octiphenyl to biphenyl) and chromophore expansion (from naphthalene diimide to perylene diimide).

Slowly sedimenting nucleoids were immunoaffinity purified using antibodies to either of two abundant mtDNA-binding proteins, TFAM or mtSSB. These two different immunoaffinity procedures yielded very similar sets of proteins, with 21 proteins in common, including most of the proteins previously shown to play roles in mtDNA replication and transcription.

It is widely accepted that the segregation of nucleoids may control the inheritance of mutant mtDNAs, thus influencing the development of mitochondrial disorders. The packaging of multiple mtDNA molecules into a single nucleoid helps to explain the classical observation that the segregation of mtDNA mutants is faster than would be expected given the large number of mtDNA genomes in a cell. Although mtDNA-binding proteins are thought to play critical roles in mtDNA maintenance and segregation (4Battersby B. Loredo-Osti J. Shoubridge E. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the composition of mtDNA nucleoids is poorly understood, especially in higher organisms. The organization and inheritance of mtDNA nucleoids has very recently been reviewed (5Chen X.J. Butow R.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 6Malka F. Lombes A. Rojo M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 5-6: 463-472Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Studies of mtDNA nucleoids in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have progressed more rapidly than experiments in higher eukaryotes due to the simplicity of the yeast nuclear genome and the fact that bakers' yeast is a facultative anaerobe that can survive without mtDNA. Formaldehyde cross-linking studies have revealed several classes of proteins in association with S. cerevisiae mtDNA, including metabolic proteins such as aconitase and Ilv5 (7Chen X.J. Wang X. Kaufman B.A. Butow R.A. Science. 2005; 307: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Other yeast proteins such as Mmm1p (8Hobbs A.E. Srinivasan M. McCaffery J.M. Jensen R.E. J.

Mmm1p is localized in close proximity to Mgm101p, which has also been characterized as a nucleoid protein (10Meeusen S. Tieu Q. Wong E. Weiss E. Schietz D. Yates J. Nunnari J. J.

Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) genetically influence mtDNA nucleoid maintenance but are not as closely associated with mtDNA. There are two major reasons why yeast mtDNA nucleoids appear to differ from those in higher eukaryotes. First, individual yeast nucleoids contain only one to two mtDNA genomes, perhaps equivalent to one genome that may or may not be replicating, whereas vertebrate mtDNA nucleoids typically contain 5-7 entire genomes (1Legros F. Malka F. Frachon P. Lombes A. Rojo M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 2Iborra F. Kimura H. Cook P. BMC Biol. 2004; 2: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Second, many of the yeast nucleoid proteins noted above lack homologs in higher eukaryotes. Biochemical studies of mtDNA nucleoids in higher eukaryotes have reported their association with the inner membrane (3Garrido N. Griparic L. Jokitalo E. Wartiovaara J. van der Bliek A.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, nucleoid proteins identified to date in mammals are largely confined to a few well characterized DNA-binding proteins. The high mobility group (HMG) family protein TFAM, related to bacterial HU protein, is a major mtDNA packaging protein conserved in yeast, frogs, and mammals (17Antoshechkin I. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol.

MtSSB, a functional and structural relative of bacterial SSB, is a single-stranded DNA-binding protein associated with mtDNA in all eukaryotes (22VanTuyle G.C. Pavco P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Van Dyck E. Foury F. Stillman B. Brill S.J.

Jokitalo E. Wartiovaara J. van der Bliek A.M. Spelbrink J.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1583-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). MtDNA molecules packaged in nucleoids are engaged in a variety of dynamic processes, including replication and transcription. Thus, the protein composition of nucleoids may be expected to vary dynamically as well. Our study of Xenopus oocyte mtDNA nucleoids (25Bogenhagen D.F. Wang Y. Shen E.L. Kobayashi R. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1205-1216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) revealed several novel mitochondrial nucleoid proteins, including adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), prohibitin, and the E2 subunits of two large dehydrogenase complexes, pyruvate dehydrogenase and branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase. The association of mtDNA nucleoids with proteins known to reside in the mitochondrial inner membrane, such as ANT and prohibitin, is a first step in understanding the classical observation that mtDNA is membrane-associated. In this study, we report purification of mtDNA nucleoids from cultured human HeLa cells and identification of associated proteins. We found that human mitochondrial nucleoids are quite heterogeneous in nature, comprising two major subsets, both associated with TFAM. [3H]Thymidine pulse labeling indicates that newly replicated DNA is distributed in both nucleoid subsets. The more rapidly sedimenting form is closely associated with cytoskeletal proteins, reminiscent of the extensive literature on yeast nucleoids summarized above. The more slowly sedimenting form lacks extensive interactions with cytoskeletal elements. We used this fraction as the starting material for immunoaffinity purification of nucleoids using antibodies directed against either of two abundant mtDNA-binding proteins, TFAM or mtSSB. A set of ∼20 proteins was detected with both of these immunoaffinity approaches, including several proteins known to be involved in mtDNA maintenance. A novel member of this set is the DEAH helicase, DHX30, which we characterize for the first time as a mitochondrial protein. In addition to these DNA metabolic proteins, which may be considered positive controls, we identified a series of chaperones, membrane proteins, and metabolic proteins similar in some respects to the yeast nucleoid complex reported recently by Chen et al. (7Chen X.J. Wang X. Kaufman B.A. Butow R.A. Science. 2005; 307: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In contrast to this work, we found no protein sequence or immunological evidence for the presence of aconitase in human mtDNA nucleoids. Cell Culture—Suspension HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts, with 1% l-glutamine, 5% bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen). Mitochondrial Preparation—All steps in purification of mitochondria and mtDNA-protein complexes were conducted at 4 °C without freezing the sample at intermediate steps. A typical preparation employed 3-3.5 × 109 cells. All buffers included a protease inhibitor mixture containing 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 2 μg/ml E64, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min and then washed in isotonic buffer (0.02 m HEPES, pH 8, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 m sucrose, 2 mm DTT). Cells were centrifuged at 900 × g for 5 min and then resuspended in hypotonic buffer (0.02 m HEPES, pH 8, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT) and recentrifuged. In some experiments these buffers were supplemented with 100 μg/ml colchicine and 10 μg/ml cytochalasin B in an effort to reduce contamination of nucleoids with cytoskeletal proteins. Pellets were then resuspended in hypotonic buffer and homogenized using a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. Two ml of 2.5× MSH was added for every 3 ml of the homogenate to adjust the solution to 1× MSH (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA). Nuclei were removed by three successive centrifugations for 5 min each at 1,600 × g to generate the postnuclear supernatant, which was layered onto preformed step gradients consisting of three layers with 1× MSH buffer containing different density media. Gradients were formed by layering 8 ml of 14.5% Nycodenz (Histodenz; Sigma) over 5 ml of 29% Nycodenz and then adding a top layer of 10 ml of 10% Percoll (Amersham Biosciences). Gradients were centrifuged for 25 min at 25,000 rpm (92,600 × g) in a Beckman SW32 rotor. The crude mitochondria were collected from the 14.5/29% Nycodenz interface, diluted with 1× MSH, and pelleted at 20,000 × g for 15 min. Nuclease Treatment of Crude Mitochondria and Purification of Mitoplasts—Crude mitochondria prepared from 4 liters of suspension culture were resuspended in 5 ml of buffer containing 1 mm ADP, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm Na2-malate, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1× MSH, 60 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm K2HPO4). 100 units/ml RNase-free DNase I (Sigma Type II) and 50 units/ml Benzonase nuclease HC (Novagen) were incubated with mitochondria at 37 °C for 15 min. 0.5 ml of 250 mm EDTA was added to chelate Mg2+ to stop nuclease digestion. The mitochondria were layered over 0.8 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT and spun at 12,000 rpm (20,000 × g) in a Sorvall HB6 rotor for 15 min to remove the digested nuclear DNA fragments and to sediment the pure mitochondria. Mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in MSH buffer and recentrifuged through the 0.8 m sucrose buffer to yield highly purified mitochondria. The purified mitochondria were resuspended in MSH buffer, mixed with 0.12 mg of digitonin/mg of mitochondrial protein, and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min with periodic mixing. The mitoplasts were washed in MSH buffer twice by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min to generate the mitoplast fraction. Velocity Sedimentation of Mitochondrial Nucleoids—Mitoplasts were resuspended at ∼7 mg/ml protein in 1.25× lysis buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 8, 5% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA). One-fourth volume of 6% Triton X-100 was added for a final concentration of 1.2% detergent. The lysate was mixed on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was loaded on top of a step gradient prepared by layering 4.5 ml of 17% glycerol over 5 ml of 45% glycerol above a pad of 0.5 ml of 30% Nycodenz and 30% glycerol. All gradient layers contained 0.5% Triton X-100, 30 mm HEPES, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 70 mm NaCl. Fractions were collected following centrifugation at 186,000 × g in an SW41 rotor for 1.5 h. [3H]Thymidine Labeling of Cultured Cells to Detect mtDNA Replication—HeLa cells grown in suspension were incubated with 1.2 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine (MP Biomedical) for 45 or 90 min before harvesting. Nucleoids from the labeled cells were prepared as described above. MtDNAs were then deproteinized by phenol-CHCl3 extraction, ethanol precipitated, and digested with HindIII. Restriction fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.7% agarose gel. The gel was soaked first in three changes of 100% methanol for 30 min each, then 3% diphenoxazole (J. T. Baker) in methanol for 30 min. The gel was soaked in H2O for 30 min, dried, and exposed to Kodak Bio-Max x-ray film that was developed after 48-72 h of exposure. Further Purification of Nucleoids and Identification of Associated Proteins—Immunoaffinity purification using antibodies directed against either TFAM or mtSSB was performed essentially as described (21Alam T.I. Kanki T. Muta T. Ukaji K. Abe Y. Nakayama H. Takio K. Hamasaki N. Kang D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1640-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 25Bogenhagen D.F. Wang Y. Shen E.L. Kobayashi R. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1205-1216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), along with control experiments using non-immune immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins were prepared and antigen affinity purified from the sera of rabbits immunized with recombinant human TFAM or mtSSB purified in our laboratory. Immunoglobulins for the nonspecific control column were prepared by affinity chromatography on Protein A-agarose using a standard protocol. The antibodies were coupled to magnetic tosyl-activated M-280 Dynabeads (Dynal) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Approximately 5 × 108 antibody-coated beads were incubated with 0.6 ml of a glycerol gradient fraction enriched in mtDNA nucleoids in glycerol gradient buffer containing 70 mm NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100. Following a 90-min incubation with mixing, the beads were collected on a magnet, and the unbound proteins were removed as a supernatant fraction. The column was then washed three times by resuspension of the beads in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 70 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were eluted with 0.5% SDS. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and fragmented by in-gel digestion with trypsin using standard methods (25Bogenhagen D.F. Wang Y. Shen E.L. Kobayashi R. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1205-1216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Peptides were identified by Nano LC-MS/MS on a QSTAR Pulsar i mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX, Foster City, CA) integrated with a Nano-LC system (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA). The mass spectral data were analyzed by Analyst QS with integrated PROID and Pro-Group software (Applied Biosystems) with reference to an interrogator data base prepared from the current GenBank™ non-redundant protein data base. Immunoblotting—Samples of gradient fractions mixed with sample loading solution were subjected to electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide gels in Tris glycine buffer (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gels were either stained with silver (27Morrissey J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar), or electrophoretically transferred to polyvinyldifluoride membrane (Immobilon PVDF, Waters) to permit detection of proteins by immunoblotting with specific primary antiserum followed by the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and colorimetric detection. The antibodies used included: homemade polyclonal rabbit sera directed against human TFAM, polymerase γ(A), polymerase γ(B), mtSSB, and DHX30 (see below); ANT, HSP60, kinectin 1, and Tom20 (Santa Cruz); voltage-dependent anion channel (Calbiochem); prohibitin (Neomarkers); vimentin and actin (Sigma). Antibodies directed against components of respiratory complex I (MS111), complex II (MS204), complex III (MS303), and complex IV (COX1) were obtained from MitoSciences. Polyclonal antibodies directed against aconitase were a gift from Dr. Luke Szweda; both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against mitofilin (IMMT (28Odgren P. Toukatly G. Bangs P. Gilmore R. Fey E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2253-2264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) were kindly provided by Drs. Paul Odgren and Reid Gilmore. Antibodies to human DHX30 were raised against a 28-kDa domain of DHX30 expressed in bacteria. A cDNA clone containing isoform 2 of DHX30 (accession number NM_014966) obtained from Origene was used as template for PCR amplification using primers 5′-ACACATATGGGAAGAGCCCTCGGCATC and 5′-CAATGCGGCCGCTTATTCTC to amplify a 747-bp fragment with unique NdeI and NotI sites. These two enzymes were used to transfer the fragment to pET22b+ to permit expression of a 28.3-kDa polypeptide in BL21 cells. This polypeptide was insoluble upon expression in Escherichia coli, but was solubilized in buffer containing 8 m urea and purified by His tag affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange chromatography in the presence of 8 m urea. A portion of this polypeptide was used to inoculate a rabbit (Cocalico Biologicals) to prepare a polyclonal antibody and a second portion was coupled to Affi-Gel resin (Bio-Rad) to permit affinity purification of antibodies. The affinity purified antibodies were used for Western blots as described above and for immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence—Monolayer HeLa cells were grown in glass slide tissue culture chambers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% bovine serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Cells were then rinsed 3 times in PBS for 5 min each, and blocked with either 0.5% milk or 5% normal goat serum in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies in 0.25% Triton X-100/PBS at 4 °C for 24 h. In some experiments 3% normal goat serum was included in the antibody incubation. Cells were rinsed in PBS for 10 min and incubated in fluorescent secondary antibody in PBS for 45-60 min. After rinsing with PBS for 10 min, the cells were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Labs). Fluorescence was visualized using a Leica TCS SP2 or a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope. The primary anti-protein antibodies used for immunofluorescence were from the sources described above; the mouse monoclonal IgM anti-DNA antibody was AC-30-10 from Progen. Mitochondrial Nucleoids Can Be Separated into Rapidly and Slowly Sedimenting Fractions—The mtDNA nucleoid purification conditions reported here reflect extensive experimentation to optimize this preparation. In early experiments, we found that mitochondria prepared by standard gradient purification procedures were contaminated significantly with fragments of nuclear DNA. This was not observed in our previous work with Xenopus oocyte mtDNA nucleoids because these cells contain considerably more mtDNA than nuclear DNA. We found that this contamination could be minimized by treating mitochondria purified through Percoll/Nycodenz gradients with DNase I and Benzonase using a procedure modified from that of Higuchi and Linn (29Higuchi Y. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7950-7956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This nuclease treatment was conducted in a buffer supplemented with metabolic substrates to retain activity of the isolated mitochondria. Whereas nuclease treatment reduced contamination by histones to a level below the limit of detection of mass spectrometry, we routinely observed some contamination of the mtDNA with short DNA fragments presumably derived from nuclear DNA. The overall scheme for mitochondrial nucleoid purification is shown in Fig. 1. MtDNA nucleoids were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” beginning with velocity sedimentation of mitochondrial lysates in glycerol gradients. Nucleoids sediment very heterogeneously in these gradients and can be divided on the basis of a rapid fluorometric stain for DNA into rapidly and slowly sedimenting fractions as shown in Fig. 2A. A portion of each fraction was saved for later analysis that confirmed that the DNA has the correct restriction pattern for mtDNA (Fig. 2B). The remainder of peak fractions was immediately processed further as described below. Immunoblots show that TFAM and mtSSB, well characterized mtDNA-binding proteins, are associated with both slowly and rapidly sedimenting nucleoid fractions. On the other hand, the cytoskeletal proteins vimentin and actin are detected readily only in the rapidly sedimenting nucleoid fraction (Fig. 2C). In one attempt to sequence proteins in the rapidly sedimenting fraction we observed extensive contamination with cytoskeletal proteins including tubulin, spectrin, and other proteins. We tried to reduce the content of cytoskeletal proteins in nucleoid preparations by including cytochalasin B and colchicine in the culture medium just prior to cell harvesting or in the cell homogenization buffer, but found that these changes had little effect (data not shown). Therefore, the proteomic analyses reported below used only the slowly sedimenting nucleoid fraction. Do the Two Forms of mtDNA Nucleoids Have Different Replication Status?—One hypothesis to account for the existence of two classes of mtDNA nucleoids is that the association of nucleoids with a structure attached to the cytoskeleton may be correlated either positively or negatively with mtDNA replication. In yeast, Meeusen and Nunnari (11Meeusen S. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) have shown that only a subset of nucleoids is engaged in replication at any instant and that replication occurs in association with a large two-membrane spanning complex. In vertebrate cells in culture, Iborra et al. (2Iborra F. Kimura H. Cook P. BMC Biol. 2004; 2: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) concluded that the entire mtDNA nucleoids do not replicate as a unit, but that single mtDNA molecules within a larger nucleoid structure replicate individually. It is conceivable that mtDNA molecules may need to be released from larger nucleoid structures when the DNA is replicated. Thus, we sought to determine whether replicating and newly replicated mtDNA molecules might be selectively enriched in either the rapidly or slowly sedimenting fraction. We pulse-labeled HeLa cell cultures with [3H]thymidine for 45 or 90 min immediately prior to isolation of nucleoids. Because approximately 1 h is required for replication of a single mtDNA molecule (30Bogenhagen D.F. Clayton D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 119: 49-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and because several minutes are required for equilibration of [3H]thymidine in the precursor pool, these pulse labeling intervals should provide selective incorporation of 3H into mtDNA replication intermediates and newly replicated molecules. Mitochondrial lysates were fractionated by glycerol gradient sedimentation and mtDNA was recovered by phenol-CHCl3 extraction and ethanol precipitation. MtDNA was digested with HindIII and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and fluorography. A comparison of the distribution of total mtDNA and pulse-labeled mtDNA in gradient fractions (Fig. 3) showed no preferential labeling of either rapidly or slowly sedimenting nucleoids. Quantification of DNA and radioactivity revealed no significant difference in the specific activity of the two peaks (data not shown). We conclude that neither nucleoid fraction is enriched in replicating or newly replicated molecules. Immunopurification of Nucleoids Using TFAM- or MtSSB-specific Antibodies—In early experiments, we used equilibrium centrifugation in isopycnic, non-ionic Nycodenz gradients for further purification of nucleoids. These experiments showed that the rapidly sedimenting fraction formed a very sharp band, characteristic of high molecular weight complexes, whereas the slowly sedimenting fraction had a less compact banding pattern (supplemental materials Fig. S1). Significantly, nuclease treatment of the rapidly sedimenting complex prior to the buoyant density gradient resulted in dispersal of the proteins to a broad region of the density gradient (supplemental materials Fig. S2), providing evidence that the proteins were initially associated with mtDNA, as previously shown for Xenopus mtDNA nucleoids (25Bogenhagen D.F. Wang Y. Shen E.L. Kobayashi R. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1205-1216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Because the density of nucleoids in Nycodenz gradients overlaps with that of some free proteins, we used affinity purified antibodies directed against either TFAM or mtSSB to immunopurify nucleoids as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 4 shows that mtSSB was recovered in complexes immunopurified with anti-TFAM antibodies, and vice versa. Both reagents precipitated complexes containing Hsp60, prohibitin, and kinectin. A control column made with non-immune IgG failed to precipitate any of these proteins, indicating that proteins were not recovered based on nonspecific adsorption to antibodies coupled to the magnetic beads. We concluded that immunopurification with either anti-TFAM or anti-mtSSB antibodies is a highly selective purification step. Additional Western blotting experiments presented below support this conclusion. During the process of developing the two-step sedimentation and immunopurification procedure reported here, we experimented extensively with use of alternative detergents and variations in the ionic strength and gradient conditions. In general, variations in the protocol such as substitution of Triton X-100 w"

https://openalex.org/W2163752014,"To gain insight into the mechanism(s) by which leptin contributes to mammary tumor (MT) development we investigated the effects of leptin, kinase inhibitors, and/or leptin receptor antagonists (LPrA2) on 4T1 mouse mammary cancer cells in vitro and LPrA2 on 4T1-MT development in vivo. Leptin increases the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), its receptor (VEGF-R2), and cyclin D1 through phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and/or extracellular signal-activated kinase 1/2 signaling pathways. In contrast to leptin-induced levels of cyclin D1 the changes in VEGF or VEGF-R2 were more dependent on specific signaling pathways. Incubation of 4T1 cells with anti-VEGF-R2 antibody increased leptin-mediated VEGF expression suggesting an autocrine/paracrine loop. Pretreatment of syngeneic mice with LPrA2 prior to inoculation with 4T1 cells delayed the development and slowed the growth of MT (up to 90%) compared with controls. Serum VEGF levels and VEGF/VEGF-R2 expression in MT were significantly lower in mice treated with LPrA2. Interestingly, LPrA2-induced effects were more pronounced in vivo than in vitro suggesting paracrine actions in stromal, endothelial, and/or inflammatory cells that may impact the growth of MT. Although all the mechanism(s) by which leptin contributes to tumor development are unknown, it appears leptin stimulates an increase in cell numbers, and the expression of VEGF/VEGF-R2. Together, these results provide further evidence suggesting leptin is a MT growth-promoting factor. The inhibition of leptin signaling could serve as a potential adjuvant therapy for treatment of breast cancer and/or provide a new target for the designing strategies to prevent MT development."

A two-photon interference experiment demonstrated that the photons could be made 90% indistinguishable, a key requirement for quantum information-processing protocols. Used as a conditional single-photon source, the system operated near the fundamental limits on recovery efficiency (57%), Fourier transform–limited bandwidth, and pair-generation-rate–limited suppression of two-photon events (factor of 33 below the Poisson limit).

https://openalex.org/W2047352825,"The PTEN protein has a single catalytic domain possessing both lipid phosphoinositol and protein phosphatase activities. The lipid phosphoinositol phosphatase activity is essential for PTEN to block the cell cycle in the G1 phase and thereby to suppress tumor formation and progression (Cantley, L. C., and Neel, B. G. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 4240-4245), although the mechanisms governing PTEN activity under normal and neoplastic growth conditions remain unclear. Here, we report that PTEN interacts physically and functionally with PCAF, a histone acetyltransferase that regulates gene transcription through interaction with p300/CBP and various sequencespecific transcription factors (Nakatani, Y. (2001) Genes Cells 6, 79-86). Expression of PCAF results in increased acetylation of lysine residues (Lys125 and Lys128) within the catalytic cleft of PTEN, a structure essential for phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate specificity (Lee, J. O., Yang, H., Georgescu, M. M., Di Cristofano, A., Maehama, T., Shi, Y., Dixon, J. E., Pandolfi, P., and Pavletich, N. P. (1999) Cell 99, 323-334). The acetylation of PTEN caused by PCAF expression depends on the presence of growth factors. Reduction of endogenous PCAF activity using shRNA results in a loss of PTEN acetylation in response to growth factors and restores the ability of PTEN to down-regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling and to induce G1 cell cycle arrest. The retention of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling and cell cycle regulatory activities of acetylationresistant PTEN K125R and K128R mutants in the presence of enforced PCAF expression suggest a causal relationship. Together, these findings indicate a mechanism of PTEN regulation that forges a link between distinct cancer-relevant pathways central to the control of growth factor signaling and gene expression.

The PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated in diverse tumor types including those of endometrium, breast, prostate, lung, and brain (4Steck P.A.

PTEN has also been shown to dephosphorylate tyrosine residues on FAK and Shc proteins (10Larsen M. Tremblay M.L. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 700-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).The regulation of PTEN in normal and pathophysiological settings is an area of active investigation. Structurally, the PTEN protein consists of an amino-terminal phosphatase domain and a carboxyl-terminal domain, which is subdivided into C2, phosphorylation, and PDZ binding domains. The C2 domain lends itself to regulation of PTEN function by contributing to membrane localization, and the phosphorylation domain controls protein stability as governed by casein kinase II-directed phosphorylation (11Maehama T.

Given the constitutive nature of casein kinase II activity, other more tightly controlled mechanisms of regulation of PTEN function would be predicted. To address this issue, we searched for PTEN-interacting proteins by analyzing cellular protein complexes containing PTEN using tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry. One candidate was the histone acetyltransferase, PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor), which associated with PTEN at endogenous levels in cells and whose expression caused acetylation of PTEN, inhibition of PTEN regulation of PI3K signaling, and inhibition of PTEN-regulated cell cycle arrest.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Transfection, and Retrovirus Infection—HEK293T and Pten-/- MEFs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

Pten-/- MEFs were infected with PTEN- and PCAF-coding retroviruses produced in 293T cells. Various PTEN mutants were constructed in enhanced GFP (EGFP) and MSCV vectors using PCR-based mutagenesis with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase.

PTEN antibody (A2B1) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and PCAF polyclonal antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Yoshihiro Nakatani, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.Immunoblotting and Coimmunoprecipitation—293T cells were transfected with the appropriate combination of plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 or treated with 50 ng/ml of EGF or 10% serum for the indicated time points, then harvested and extracted in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG or anti-GFP antibody-conjugated beads (Sigma and Covance, respectively) for 4 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and then subjected to immunoblotting.Microscopy for Localization—Images were acquired on a DeltaVision deconvolution microscope (Applied Precision) equipped with a Coolsnap CCD camera (Roper Scientific). 293T cells seeded on coverslips were transfected with the appropriate combination of plasmids and subsequently fixed with 0.4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline followed by microscopic analysis.In Vitro Acetylation Assay—In vitro expressed GST-PCAF proteins (Upstate) were incubated for 1 h at 30°C with 5 μg of GST, GST-PTEN, and GST-PTEN K125/8Q mutant in HAT assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm [14C]acetyl-CoA or 0.2 mm acetyl-CoA. Completed reactions were subjected to autoradiography or used for PTEN phosphatase assay.Lipid Phosphatase Assay—In vitro acetylated GST-PTEN and GST-PTEN K125R mutant proteins (300 ng) were assayed for lipid phosphatase activity against PI(3,4,5)P3 (Echelon Biosciences) essentially as described previously (16Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Released phosphate was detected colometrically with Biomol green (Biomol Research Laboratories) and quantitated with a GeniosPro plate reader (Tecan).Suppression of PCAF Expression by shRNA—Three shRNA plasmids for PCAF-directed knockdown were constructed in the pSuper vector and contained the following sequences: CAGACTCCTGGGAATAGTA, ACCTGTGGTTGAAGGCTCT, and TTGCGCTTTCTTCACGGCG. These constructs were mixed and transfected into 293T cells with Lipofectamine 2000.Cell Cycle Analysis—Pten-/- MEFs were infected with Ecotropic virus containing MSCV-hyg-PTEN and pBabe-PCAF and selected with hygromycin and puromycin, respectively. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 70% ethanol, stained with propidium iodide (25 μg/m1) (Sigma), and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with RNase A (20 μg/ml). The DNA content of the cells was then evaluated by flow cytometry (FACSort, Becton Dickinson). Linear red fluorescence (FL2) was analyzed.RESULTSPTEN and PCAF Interact in Vivo—To identify PTEN interacting proteins, tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry was used to isolate and analyze PTEN-containing complexes. FLAG-hemagglutinin-NH2-terminal-tagged PTEN was expressed in 293T cells and purified by successive FLAG and hemagglutinin immunoprecipitations. Subsequently PTEN-associated proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry, resulting in the identification of the histone acetyltransferase, PCAF, as a member of the complexes. The validity of the candidacy of PCAF was also suggested by a yeast two-hybrid screen of human and mouse cDNA libraries with the carboxyl-terminal region of PTEN (amino acids 186-401) that encompasses the regulatory phosphorylation domain. One candidate cDNA recovered, KIAA1343, exhibits structural similarity to the transcriptional adapter protein, hADA2, a molecule associated with PCAF in vivo (17Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X.

Since both of these approaches pointed toward PCAF, we sought to determine whether PTEN and PCAF interacted in vivo in 293T cells, which express wild-type PTEN and PCAF, using reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation. These experiments showed that anti-PTEN immunoprecipitates contained PCAF and, conversely, extracts exposed to anti-PCAF antibody also coprecipitated PTEN (Fig. 1, a and b), demonstrating that PTEN and PCAF interact physically at endogenous levels.To define the PCAF interaction domain in PTEN, various PTEN deletion constructs (Fig. 1c) were coexpressed together with FLAG-tagged PCAF (FLAG-PCAF) in 293T cells. FLAG-PCAF interacted with full-length, N202 (amino acids 1-202), and 186C (amino acids 186-403) GFP-tagged PTEN proteins but not with 331C (amino acids 331-403) (Fig. 1d). Deletion of the region shared by N202 and 186C (Δ186-202) generated a protein that failed to interact with PCAF (Fig. 1e) and lacks lipid phosphatase activity (data not shown). PTEN is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm in most situations (7Furnari F.B. Lin H. Huang H.S. Cavenee W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12479-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) but is capable of moving into the nucleus under some conditions (19Lachyankar M.B. Sultana N. Schonhoff C.M. Mitra P. Poluha W. Lambert S. Quesenberry P.J. Litofsky N.S. Recht L.D. Nabi R. Miller S.J. Ohta S. Neel B.G. Ross A.H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1404-1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PTEN and PCAF occupy cellular compartments within which they could physiologically interact, we performed deconvolution microscopy of PTEN and PCAF that were differentially labeled (Fig. 2). As expected, PCAF localized to the nucleus in the presence of either wildtype PTEN or PTENΔ186-202. In the presence of PCAF, wild-type PTEN also was predominantly nuclear, while PTENΔ186-202, which does not interact with PCAF, was predominantly cytoplasmic. Thus, PCAF binding may provide a means of moving PTEN from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. We conclude that PTEN interacts with the PCAF complex in vivo through the PTEN hinge region, a structure that separates the amino-terminal catalytic domain from the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain (3Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P.

First, endogenous PTEN was immunoprecipitated and then immunoblotted with an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody, revealing that PTEN is acetylated at steady state (Fig. 3a). Correspondingly, immunobloting detected PTEN in anti-acetyl-lysine immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, the acetylation level of endogenous PTEN increased upon exposure of cells to tricostatin A, an inhibitor of Class 1 and 2 HDACs (20Brunet A. Sweeney L.B. Sturgill J.F. Chua K.F. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Tran H. Ross S.E. Mostoslavsky R. Cohen H.Y. Hu L.S. Cheng H.L. Jedrychowski M.P. Gygi S.P. Sinclair D.A. Alt F.W. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2004; 303: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3b), leading us to conclude that the acetylation of PTEN in vivo is a dynamic process. We then tested whether PCAF expression affects the level of PTEN acetylation. Enforced PCAF expression resulted in enhanced acetylation of wild-type PTEN (Fig. 3c) but not the PTEN 186C truncation mutant, a finding consistent with the possibility that one or more of the lysine residues from positions 1-186 were acetylated in response to PCAF expression.FIGURE 3The NH2-terminal region of PTEN is acetylated in vivo. a, 293T cell lysates were precipitated with anti-PTEN or control IgG antibody followed by immunoblotting for acetylated PTEN with anti-acetyl-lysine antibody. b, lysates treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), were immunoprecipitated with anti-acetyl-lysine antibody or mouse IgG followed by anti-PTEN immunoblotting. c, lysates of 293T cells cotransfected with GFP-PTEN or GFP-PTEN 186C and wild-type or HAT domain mutant PCAF constructs (Δ579-608 and Δ609-624) were precipitated with anti-GFP, and acetylated GFP-PTEN was detected by anti-acetyl-lysine immunoblotting. The filter was reprobed with anti-GFP to determine immunoprecipitation efficiency.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Acetylation of PTEN Lysines 125 and 128 in Response to PCAF Regulates Enzymatic Activity—An interspecies comparison of PTEN amino acid sequences shows that lysine residues 125 and 128 are evolutionarily conserved (with the exception of the substitution of arginine for lysine at the first position in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (Fig. 4a). To determine whether these lysine residues were the targets of acetylation caused by PCAF expression, we constructed mutant PTEN alleles in which non-acetylatable arginines were substituted for lysines 125 and 128 (K125R, K128R, and K125/8R). A K80R allele was also generated since mutation at this position has been found in a human glioblastoma tumor (5Eng C. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 22: 183-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) and a K144R allele, which is not evolutionally conserved, was constructed to serve as a potential negative control. When coexpressed with PCAF, the K125R and K128R alleles of PTEN exhibited reduced acetylation, as compared with wild-type or other arginine substitution mutants of PTEN (Fig. 4b). That these modifications can be directly mediated by PCAF was demonstrated by showing that PCAF directly acetylated PTEN, but not a K125/8Q mutant, in an in vitro acetylation assay (Fig. 4c). These data indicate that lysines 125 and 128 of PTEN are preferentially acetylated by PCAF; it is also possible that other lysine residues are sequentially modified by PCAF following the initial acetylation of Lys125 and Lys128.FIGURE 4PCAF-mediates acetylation of PTEN lysines 125 and 128. a, evolutionarily conserved NH2-terminal PTEN lysines are shown in red. Lys80 has been found mutated in glioblastoma (34Bonneau D. Longy M. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Lys125 and Lys128 are located in the catalytic core domain. b, 293T cell lysates cotransfected with various PTEN constructs mutated at conserved lysines and with PCAF or empty vector were immunoprecipitated with anti-PTEN antibody followed by anti-acetyl-lysine immunoblotting. Efficiency of PTEN immunoprecipitation was assessed by reprobing with anti-PTEN. c, wild-type PTEN or acetylation mimicking glutamine mutant (125/8Q) fusion proteins were reacted with recombinant PCAF and [14C]acetyl-CoA followed by autoradiographic detection of acetylated PTEN. Equal amounts of reacted GST-PTEN were verified by Coomassie staining of the membrane (lower panel). d, GST-PTEN or -K125R mutant was reacted with recombinant PCAF followed by assessment of PTEN 3′-phosphoinositol phosphatase activity using PI(3,4,5)P3 as a substrate.

Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Of relevance to this report is the observation that PCAF-related histone acetyltransferases, such as p300/CBP, have also been shown to modify and regulate the function of cytosolic proteins such as importin-α7 (21Bannister A.J. Miska E.A. Gorlich D. Kouzarides T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 467-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These observations led us to conduct a series of experiments designed to assess the biochemical and functional impact of acetylation on PTEN activity. Since PCAF caused the acetylation of two lysine residues within the catalytic site of PTEN, we postulated that PCAF might alter the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN that is responsible for regulating the activation of Akt. Consistent with this idea, an in vitro lipid phosphatase assay showed that PCAF inhibited 45% of PTEN activity but only 19% of acetylationresistant K125R activity (Fig. 4d).Akt Activation Is Regulated by PTEN Acetylation in Response to PCAF—When PCAF was coexpressed with wild-type PTEN in 293T cells, we observed a marked increase in Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 5a). This allowed an assessment of the ability of various PTEN mutants to modulate the phosphorylation levels of endogenous Akt in cells grown under conditions of growth factor exposure (Fig. 5, b and c). Consistent with results described above, expression of wild-type PTEN and the K125R and K128R mutants led to a decrease in the level of phosphorylated Akt in 293T cells and in Pten-/- MEFs, while other PTEN mutants were compromised for this activity (Fig. 5, b and c). Neither the K125/128Q mutant, which mimics acetylated PTEN, nor PCAF alone were able to decrease phospho-Akt levels (Fig. 5, b and c). Taken together, these results indicate that PCAF-mediated acetylation of PTEN inhibits its activity in the regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.FIGURE 5The ability of PTEN to down-regulate Akt activation is inhibited by acetylation in response to PCAF. a, lysates of 293T cells, transfected with PTEN and PCAF plasmid combinations and cultured under 2% serum condition, were immunoprecipitated with anti-Akt antibody followed by p-Akt and total Akt immunoblotting. b, 293T cells were transfected with GFP-tagged wild-type PTEN, and PTEN lysine 125 and 128 arginine (Arg) or glutamine (Gln) mutants (to mimic acetylation) and cultured under 2% serum. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Akt followed by p-Akt(Ser473) immunoblotting. The efficiency of immunoprecipitation was assessed by reprobing with anti-Akt. c, PTEN null MEFs were infected with retroviruses expressing PTEN and various PTEN mutants and p-Akt and total Akt were detected by direct immunoblotting of whole cell lysates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Ability of PTEN to Regulate G1 Arrest Is Dependent on PCAF—PTEN inhibition of Akt activation has been reported to elicit cell cycle arrest (8Furnari F.B. Huang H.J. Cavenee W.K. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5002-5008PubMed Google Scholar) and to modulate cellular responses to growth factor stimulation (9Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 125-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). This led us to test whether PCAF could inhibit these PTEN-mediated activities. First, wild-type PTEN or the K125R and K128R mutants were expressed in Pten-/- MEFs in the absence of PCAF (Fig. 6). Each resulted in similar G1 cell cycle arrests (78.0, 73.9, and 70.0% G1, respectively, compared with 56.2% G1 for empty vector-infected cells). Alleviation of G1 arrest occurred when PCAF was coexpressed with wild-type PTEN (54.3% G1). This relief of the arrest was not observed when PCAF was coexpressed with the acetylation-resistant, lipid phosphatase-competent PTEN mutants, K125R and K128R (Fig. 6; 73.5 and 73.9% G1, respectively). The double K125/128Q mutant, was unable to cause a G1 arrest (54.9% and 59.4% G1, respectively).FIGURE 6PCAF-mediated acetylation of PTEN controls cell cycle progression. PCAF eliminates wild-type PTEN-mediated cell cycle block but does not affect acetylation-resistant, lipid phosphatase-competent, K125R and K128R mutants. PTEN null MEFs infected with MSCV-hyg virus (vector), MSCV-hyg expressing wild-type PTEN, K125R, K128R, or K125/128Q mutants, either alone or coinfected with pBabe-PCAF, were assessed for DNA content by flow cytometry.

PTEN acetylation and its interaction with PCAF were enhanced with serum and growth factor treatment. Correspondingly, when PCAF is reduced by shRNA knockdown, PTEN is poorly acetylated (Fig. 7b). Moreover, this diminution of acetylation corresponds to an increased ability of PTEN to down-regulate PI3K signaling, as reflected by a reduction in Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 7c). These data indicate that PTEN function is inhibited when it is acetylated by PCAF and that this promotes G1/S transition through activation of the PI3K pathway.FIGURE 7Growth factor stimulation promotes PTEN and PCAF association and enhances PTEN acetylation. a, lysates from serum-starved 293T cells, stimulated with EGF for 30 or 60 min or serum (S) for 60 min, were precipitated with anti-PTEN followed by immunoblotting for coprecipitated PCAF, acetylated PTEN (acetyl-Lys), and total PTEN. Akt activation was determined by immunoblotting whole cell lysates (WCL) and probing for p-Akt-(Ser473) versus total Akt.

One possible mechanism for this is that modification of lysine residues within the catalytic pocket may interfere with substrate binding. However, Lys125 and Lys128 are located in the flexible catalytic domain P-loop structure (3Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), which suggests that the addition of small acetyl groups would not physically impede interaction with substrate. Alternatively, acetylation of these lysine residues might cause the loss of a positive charge in the catalytic cleft known to be required for selectivity of the negatively charged PI(3,4,5)P3 substrate, as well as its orientation within the cleft (3Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar).It is interesting to note that the yeast two hybrid screen identified KIAA1343 as a PTEN-interacting partner. This raises the possibility that it might act as a bridge between PTEN and PCAF and that its modulation might affect that interaction. While this has not been directly tested, KIAA1343 did not appear in the tandem affinity purification/mass spectrometry complexes. Moreover, 293T cells express very little KIAA1343 and they are responsive to manipulations of the PTEN and PCAF interaction. Whether this points the way toward cell type specificity of the complexes, or was the fortunate consequence of the presence in the yeast two hybrid assay of the endogenous PCAF homolog, GCN5, is an area requiring investigation.Phosphorylation of p300/CBP by cyclin E/cd"

The crystallinity of the surface monolayer is notable, considering that AuSi does not form stable bulk crystalline phases at any concentration and temperature and that no crystalline surface phase has been detected thus far in any pure liquid metal or nondilute alloy.

https://openalex.org/W2149991815,"The DNMT3-like protein, DNMT3L, is required for germ line DNA methylation, although it is inactive as a DNA methyltransferase per se. Previous studies have shown that DNMT3L physically associates with the active de novo DNA methyltransferases, DNMT3A and DNMT3B, and stimulates their catalytic activities in a cell culture system. However, the mechanism by which DNMT3L stimulates de novo methylation remains unclear. Here, we have purified the full-length human DNMT3A2 and DNMT3L proteins and determined unique conditions that allow for the proper reconstitution of the stimulation of DNMT3A2 de novo methyltransferase activity by DNMT3L.

Under these conditions, maximal stimulation is reached at equimolar amounts of DNMT3L and DNMT3A2 proteins, and the catalytic efficiency of DNMT3A2 is increased up to 20-fold. Biochemical analysis revealed that whereas DNMT3L on its own does not significantly bind to the methyl group donor, S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM), it strongly increases the binding of SAM to DNMT3A2.

Analysis of DNA methyltransferase complexes in solution using size exclusion chromatography revealed that DNMT3A2 forms large structures of heterogeneous sizes, whereas DNMT3L appears as a monomer.

In mammals, the methylation of cytosines represents the only known form of covalent DNA modification that has a clear biological function, through its association with stable transcriptional silencing (1Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5486) Google Scholar). Such silencing is critical for proper embryonic development, genome stability, X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, and the silencing of retrotransposons (2Li E. Nat. Rev.

Biochem. 2004; 74: 481-574Crossref Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). In addition, aberrant DNA methylation underlies many human diseases, including cancer, which is often associated with a genome-wide loss of DNA methylation and inappropriate silencing of tumor suppressor genes (5Robertson K.D.

DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) 2The abbreviations used are: DNMT, DNA methyltransferase; SAM, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; 3H-SAM, S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin. are essential enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from a donor molecule, S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM), to a cytosine ring, usually located within the context of a symmetrical CpG dinucleotide (7Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). Mammalian genomes carry three distinct active DNMT genes. Two de novo DNMTs, encoded by the DNMT3A and DNMT3B genes, have been identified (8Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). These proteins show a high similarity to each other and have several domains in common, including a highly conserved C-terminal domain containing catalytic DNMT motifs that are homologous to those originally defined for bacterial type II cytosine DNMTs (9Posfai J. Bhagwat A.S. Posfai G. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). DNMT3A and DNMT3B are considered to be de novo DNMTs, since they are responsible for initiating DNA methylation during early embryonic development (10Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar), and show a preference for unmethylated DNA in vitro (8Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat.

Specific isoforms of DNMT3A and DNMT3B are expressed during germ cell development and early embryogenesis, which correspond to the two most active phases of methylation reprogramming. These isoforms are generated through the use of an alternative promoter in the case of DNMT3A and of alternative splicing for DNMT3B. The isoforms and their expression patterns are conserved from mice to humans, indicating that they may carry out specific biological functions, although little is known about these potential roles. The DNMT1 enzyme, contrary to DNMT3A and DNMT3B, shows a preference for hemimethylated DNA substrates, is associated with replication foci, and is therefore considered a maintenance DNA methyltransferase (12Leonhardt H.

Together, these enzymes can generate new DNA methylation patterns and maintain them through cellular divisions, therefore forming the basis of a stable epigenetic transcriptional memory. The DNMT3-like protein, DNMT3L, was identified as a third member of the DNMT3 family based on the high conservation of its N-terminal cysteine-rich domain with the corresponding domains in DNMT3A and DNMT3B (16Aapola U. Kawasaki K. Scott H.S. Ollila J. Vihinen M. Heino M. Shintani A. Minoshima S. Krohn K. Antonarakis S.E. Shimizu N. Kudoh J. Peterson P. Genomics. 2000; 65: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The C terminus of DNMT3L also shows partial homology to the catalytic C-terminal regions of DNMT3A and DNMT3B, although the domain is truncated and key residues involved in catalysis are not conserved. As a result, DNMT3L is inactive as a DNMT proper (17Hata K. Okano M. Lei H. Li E. Development. 2002; 129: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chedin F. Lieber M.R. Hsieh C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16916-16921Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). However, targeted mutagenesis of the Dnmt3L gene in mouse revealed that Dnmt3L is essential for the establishment of maternal methylation imprints during oogenesis (17Hata K. Okano M. Lei H. Li E. Development. 2002; 129: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bourc'his D. Xu G.L. Lin C.S. Bollman B. Bestor T.H. Science. 2001; 294: 2536-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). In addition, Dnmt3L–/– males are sterile and show loss of methylation and reactivation of normally silent retrotransposon elements (20Bourc'his D. Bestor T.H. Nature. 2004; 431: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 21Webster K.E. O'Bryan M K. Fletcher S. Crewther P.E. Aapola U. Craig J. Harrison D.K. Aung H. Phutikanit N. Lyle R. Meachem S.J.

Yokomine T. Li E. Sasaki H. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2006; 73: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). DNMT3L is therefore critical for establishing methylation patterns in the germ line. Using an episomal system in a human cell culture model, we have shown that DNMT3L is a general stimulatory factor for de novo methylation mediated by all active isoforms of DNMT3A and DNMT3B (18Chedin F. Lieber M.R. Hsieh C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16916-16921Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 23Chen Z.X. Mann J.R. Hsieh C.L. Riggs A.D. Chedin F. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 902-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Stimulation by DNMT3L was observed at all sequences tested, suggesting that it does not function as a targeting factor. Instead, DNMT3L promotes the acquisition of extensive DNA methylation patterns that are characteristic of gametic methylation marks found at imprinting centers. This stimulation is mediated by a direct protein-protein interaction between the C-terminal, catalytic-like, region of DNMT3L and the active catalytic domains of DNMT3 isoforms (23Chen Z.X. Mann J.R. Hsieh C.L. Riggs A.D. Chedin F. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 902-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Suetake I. Shinozaki F. Miyagawa J. Takeshima H. Tajima S. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 4: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Whereas DNMT3L can stimulate all active isoforms of DNMT3A and DNMT3B, genetic studies strongly suggest that members of the DNMT3A family are the most likely functional partners of DNMT3L. Indeed, germ cell-specific disruption of the Dnmt3a locus recapitulates many of the phenotypes observed in Dnmt3L–/– animals, suggesting that the two gene products functionally interact to establish DNA methylation marks in germ cells. On the contrary, disruption of the Dnmt3b locus had no detectable effect (26Kaneda M. Okano M. Hata K. Sado T. Tsujimoto N. Li E. Sasaki H. Nature. 2004; 429: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Expression studies confirm these results and further indicate that DNMT3A2 might be the most physiologically relevant methyltransferase to associate with DNMT3L in germ cells. Murine Dnmt3L expression is highly up-regulated at specific stages of germ cell development, coinciding with the acquisition of gametic methylation in the male and female germ lines (27Lucifero D. Mann M.R. Bartolomei M.S. Trasler J.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 318: 839-849Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 28La Salle S. Mertineit C. Taketo T. Moens P.B. Bestor T.H. Trasler J.M. Dev. Biol. 2004; 268: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In males, Dnmt3a, particularly the Dnmt3a2 isoform, is also highly overexpressed at the same stage in gonocytes (28La Salle S. Mertineit C. Taketo T. Moens P.B. Bestor T.H. Trasler J.M. Dev. Biol. 2004; 268: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 29Sakai Y. Suetake I. Shinozaki F. Yamashina S. Tajima S. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2004; 5: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data strongly indicate that DNMT3A2 is an important physiological target for stimulation by DNMT3L. In this work, we have purified full-length human DNMT3A2 and DNMT3L proteins, reconstituted the stimulation of de novo methylation in vitro, and analyzed the biochemical mechanism of this stimulation. Chemicals, Enzymes, and Chromatography Media—Unless indicated, chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma. Proteinase K was from Roche Applied Science. Restriction endonucleases and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from New England Biolabs. Shrimp alkaline phosphatase and [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. and PerkinElmer Life Sciences, respectively. Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. S-Adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine was purchased from GE Healthcare (specific activity 15.0 Ci/mmol). Chromatography media and prepacked HisTrap and HiTrap DEAE columns were from GE Healthcare (Amersham Biosciences), with the exception of chitin resin (New England Biolabs). Generation of Expression Vectors for Human DNMT3A2 and DNMT3L Proteins—The human DNMT3A2 and DNMT3L coding regions were from previously published expression vectors (23Chen Z.X. Mann J.R. Hsieh C.L. Riggs A.D. Chedin F. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 902-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The DNMT3A2 coding region was excised from pcDNA3/MYC-DNMT3A2 using EcoRI and BamHI sites and recloned into a modified version of pGEX-6p-2 (GE Healthcare), leading to pGEX*-hDNMT3A2. In this modified version, the multiple cloning site of pGEX-6p-2 was changed to include an in-frame His6 tag immediately followed by EcoRI, HindIII, XbaI, BamHI, and NotI sites. This vector allows for affinity purification using the cleavable GST tag with the cleaved protein still carrying an N-terminal His6 tag suitable for nickel affinity chromatography. The DNMT3L coding sequence was first recloned into the modified pGEX vector using EcoRI and XbaI sites (generating pGEX*-hDNMT3L) and reamplified by PCR using primers introducing unique NheI and SapI sites 5′ to the His6 tag and immediately 3′ to the end of the coding region, respectively. The PCR fragment was introduced into pTYB1 (New England Biolabs) using the NheI and SapI sites, generating a fusion protein between hDNMT3L and the self-cleavable intein-CBD tag (generating pTYB1-hDNMT3L). Using this vector, DNMT3L can be purified through nickel and chitin affinity chromatography. Protein Purification—Human DNMT3A2 protein was purified from freshly transformed Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) cells (Novagen) grown in LB broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and 0.2% glucose. After induction of protein expression for 2 h with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C, cells were harvested and lysed by a French press in DNMT3A2 lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 μg/ml RNase A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 μg/ml pepstatin A). The lysate was spun for 30 min at 30,000 × g to remove any cellular debris, and the supernatant was subsequently loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap DEAE FF column. The DEAE flow-through was immediately applied to a 20-ml GST column and washed with 3 column volumes of lysis buffer, and the fusion protein was eluted using GST elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 40 mm reduced glutathione). After dialysis against Prescission protease buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA), the GST tag was cleaved by Prescission protease (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4 °C. Cleavage efficiency was typically greater than 95%. The cleaved DNMT3A2 protein was dialyzed against nickel buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole), loaded onto a 1-ml HisTrap HP column, and eluted using nickel buffer supplemented with 250 mm imidazole. This elution was dialyzed against S-200 buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 m NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA) and run on a 16/60 Superdex-200 preparation grade gel filtration column. Fractions corresponding to full-length DNMT3A2 protein were combined, concentrated, and frozen at –80 °C in storage buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol). The human DNMT3L protein was purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene) grown in LB broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and 0.2% glucose. After induction of protein expression for 2 h with 0.15 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C, cells were lysed by a French press in nickel buffer supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 25 μg/ml RNase A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 μg/ml pepstatin A. The lysate was spun as described above, and the supernatant was applied to a 5-ml HisTrap FF column. The fusion protein was eluted using nickel buffer supplemented with 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 500 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was dialyzed against chitin binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol), and bound to chitin resin. DNMT3L was cleaved from the bound chitin binding protein using chitin cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 500 mm NaCl, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol). The eluted DNMT3L was concentrated and frozen in storage buffer supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100. Protein concentration was determined by their absorbance at 280 nm using theoretical extinction coefficients (ϵ = 122,320 m–1 cm–1 for DNMT3A2 and 68,610 m–1 cm–1 for DNMT3L) and by Bradford assays (Bio-Rad). The protein preparations were over 93% pure for DNMT3A2 and 99% pure for DNMT3L, as calculated using band densitometry (Fig. 1) and devoid of any contaminating exonucleases (data not shown). Yields of 0.25–0.5 mg of purified protein/g of cells (wet mass) were typically obtained. Activity Assays—DNA methyltransferase activity was monitored by the transfer of tritiated methyl groups from S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (3H-SAM) onto double-stranded poly(dI-dC) DNA substrates, as described (13Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33002-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. The concentration of poly(dI-dC) is reported as the concentration of CI dinucleotides (assuming an average length of 7000 bp). The reactions were performed in either “standard” buffer (25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaOAc, 100 μg/ml BSA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), or activity buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml BSA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Unless otherwise indicated, purified DNMTs were combined with 3H-SAM in buffer and preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h before the reaction was initiated by the addition of DNA. Reactions were stopped by rapid freezing and inactivation of the DNMTs by the addition of proteinase K to 450 μg/ml, followed by incubation at 55 °C for 10 min. Reactions were spotted onto 2.4-cm DE81 filters (Whatman), and the filters were washed five times with 1 ml of cold 0.3 m ammonium bicarbonate, three times with 1 ml of nanopure H2O, and three times with 1 ml of 100% EtOH. Filters were then air-dried and counted in 4 ml of Ecolite Scintillation Mixture (MP Biomedicals) using a LS6000IC scintillation counter (Beckman-Coulter). Background SAM binding to the filters was removed by subtracting the counts obtained for a no protein control (typically 100–300 cpm). Nonlinear regression was performed using Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad Software). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Binding reactions were set up in activity buffer supplemented with 10% glycerol. Purified DNMTs were preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h before the addition of a 488-bp fragment of the human SNRPN imprinting center. The fragment had been dephosphorylated by treatment with shrimp alkaline phosphatase and 5′-end-labeled by polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP. 0.1 μm DNA (as measured in 10-nucleotide sites) was titrated against protein concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 9 μm for DNMT3A2 and DNMT3A2-DNMT3L and from 0.01 to 13 μm for DNMT3L. DNA binding was allowed to reach equilibrium over 20 min at 37 °C, and samples were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel and run at 65 V for 1.5 h. Gels were dried onto DE81 paper, exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, scanned on an Amersham Biosciences Storm 860 PhosphorImager, and analyzed using ImageQuant software version 5.2. DNA concentrations are reported here as the concentration of 10-nucleotide double-stranded segments. To verify that DNMT3L is part of stable DNMT3A2-DNMT3L complexes bound to DNA, purified DNMTs were bound as described above to a 5′-biotinylated PCR product corresponding to the same 488-bp fragment of the SNRPN imprinting center. 2.5 μm DNA was bound in the presence of a 4 μm concentration of each protein. Streptavidin-agarose beads were added and incubated with the reaction for 30 min at 30 °C. After binding, the beads were collected, washed five times in activity buffer with 10% glycerol, and resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were run on an 8% polyacrylamide gel to identify the proteins that formed a stable complex on the DNA. Centrifugal Ultrafiltration—Binding reactions were set up in activity buffer lacking BSA. Varying concentrations of purified DNMTs were preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h before the addition of 0.5 μm 3H-SAM. SAM binding was allowed to reach equilibrium over 20 min at 37 °C, at which time the binding reactions were partially passed through YM-30 Microcon centrifugal filters (Millipore). The radioactivity present in the filtrate and retentate was then measured by scintillation counting, as described above. The concentration of SAM in the filtrate corresponds to the concentration of free SAM, [SAM]f, whereas the concentration of SAM in the retentate corresponds to the sum of the concentrations of free SAM plus bound SAM, [SAM]f + [SAM]b. Nonspecific retention of SAM in the upper chamber in the absence of any protein was observed and measured using multiple independent controls. The average value for this nonspecific binding was subtracted from the total bound SAM value in each binding reaction, therefore allowing us to measure specific binding of SAM to DNMTs. No significant binding of SAM to the membrane during centrifugation was observed, as indicated by the fact that the total SAM amounts in the system were not different before and after centrifugation and did not show any protein-dependent change (data not shown). The concentration of bound SAM was plotted as a function of protein concentration, and KSAMD was determined by nonlinear regression to the quadratic solution for a single-site binding mechanism as shown in Equation 1,[SAM]b=B-B2-4[DNMT]t[SAM]t2(Eq. 1) where B = [DNMT]t + [SAM]t + KD. Gel Filtration—Purified DNMTs were dialyzed into activity buffer lacking BSA and preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h. 100 μgof protein at 1 mg/ml was loaded onto a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column controlled by an ÄKTAFPLC system run by Unicorn version 4.00.16 software (GE Healthcare). The flow rate was kept constant at 0.3 ml/min. Elution volumes (Ve) were determined using the Unicorn software. To create the standard curve, 100 μg of the five protein components of the Sigma non-denatured protein standard kit (urease, BSA, chicken egg albumin, carbonic anhydrase, and α-lactalbumin) as well as apoferritin (Sigma) were run on the Superose 6 column and their Ve values were determined. Kav values were determined from Ve values, the column void volume (Vo), and the total column volume (Vt) according to Equation 2.Kav=Ve-VoVt-Vo(Eq. 2) Kav was plotted against the log of the molecular weight, and nonlinear regression was performed using Prism version 4.0. Reconstitution of the Stimulation of de Novo Methylation by DNMT3L in Vitro—In order to analyze the mechanism by which the DNMT3L protein stimulates de novo methylation by the DNMT3A2 DNA methyltransferase, we purified both full-length proteins using recombinant expression vectors in E. coli. The resulting proteins were 93% pure for DNMT3A2 and 99% pure for DNMT3L (Fig. 1) and were devoid of any exonuclease activity that could otherwise affect the nature and concentration of the DNA substrate (data not shown). We first assayed DNA methyltransferase activity using DNMT3A2 alone in order to verify that the protein was active. For this, the protein (0.5 μm), the DNA substrate (poly(dI-dC); 100 μm measured in CI dinucleotides), and radiolabeled 3H-SAM (2 μm) were mixed, and methylation activity was followed over 2 h. DNMT3A2 showed robust, time-dependent methyltransferase activity, as shown in Fig. 2. Methyltransferase activity was strictly dependent on the DNMT3A2 protein concentration (data not shown) and was linear with time for the first 15 min of the reaction, after which the velocity of the reaction slowly decreased (Fig. 2A). This nonlinear shape is, at least in part, due to a build-up of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine levels, the breakdown product of SAM and an inhibitor of enzyme activity. As shown in Fig. 2A, DNMT3A2 activity resulted in the transfer of over a 0.1 μm concentration of methyl groups in the first 30 min, which is within range of the Ki for S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (data not shown). The addition of DNMT3L protein in a 1:1 molar stoichiometry did not result in a significant increase in the initial rate of the reaction (Fig. 2, A and B), although the methyltransferase activity was progressively increased with time to reach a total stimulation of 1.6-fold after 2 h. Since DNMT3A2 and DNMT3L physically interact with each other through their C-terminal domains (23Chen Z.X. Mann J.R. Hsieh C.L. Riggs A.D. Chedin F. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 902-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), we investigated whether preincubating the two proteins together prior to the initiation of the reaction would result in improved stimulation by allowing time for the two proteins to form physical complexes. For this, DNMT3A2 was preincubated either alone or together with an equimolar amount of DNMT3L, in the presence of 3H-SAM for 1 h at 37°C, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of DNA and followed over time. Fig. 2 shows that whereas DNMT3A2 was not significantly affected by preincubation, the methyltransferase activity of DNMT3A2 observed in the presence of DNMT3L was strongly enhanced at early time points, leading to a 2.5-fold stimulation of the initial rate. Over time, however, the level of stimulation observed with and without preincubation was similar, presumably because the two proteins have ample time to interact during the course of the 2-h reaction. Thus, preincubation of the two proteins is required for observing maximal stimulation in vitro, particularly at early time points. Preincubating the proteins for 2 h did not change the level of stimulation; however, a 30-min preincubation was not sufficient to reach maximal stimulation (data not shown). In the previous experiments, we employed a “standard” buffer, which, with minor variations, is often used in the field and is characterized by low ionic strength, low monovalent salt concentrations, high EDTA concentrations, and the absence of divalent salts. In order to determine optimal conditions for the reconstitution of the stimulation of DNA methyltransferase activity, we investigated whether buffer conditions could affect the process. Specifically, we investigated whether stimulation by DNMT3L could be reconstituted under more physiological buffer conditions, since human cells contain both monovalent and divalent salts. We first removed EDTA and increased the monovalent salt concentration to 50 mm KCl and observed that the stimulatory effect of DNMT3L on the initial velocity of the reaction was increased (Fig. 2C). We then titrated in 0.5, 1, or 2 mm of MgCl2 and observed an increase in the relative stimulation by DNMT3L both at the level of the initial rate and extent at 2 h (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Strikingly, the initial rate of the reaction was stimulated nearly 20-fold at 1 mm MgCl2, as compared with a modest 1.7-fold in “standard” buffer conditions. The stimulatory effect of DNMT3L is therefore only fully unmasked in buffers containing nearly physiological levels of free magnesium ions (0.5–1 mm (30Romani A.M. Scarpa A. Front Biosci. 2000; 5: D720-D734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Touyz R.M. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 1278-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar)) and monovalent salts. It should be noted that the addition of MgCl2 actually inhibited DNMT3A2 methyltransferase activity, in agreement with a previous report (32Yokochi T. Robertson K.D. Bioorg. Chem. 2004; 32: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). DNMT3L relieved the inhibitory effect of magnesium ions on DNMT3A2 (supplemental Fig. 1). In addition to preincubation and buffer conditions, we investigated the requirements in terms of the molar stoichiometric ratio of DNMT3A2 to DNMT3L required for optimal stimulation. For this, DNMT3A2 was kept constant at 0.5 μm, DNMT3L was varied, and the relative -fold stimulation afforded by DNMT3L was measured (a buffer containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 was used toget"

We investigated the capacity for bacterial divergence with a chemostat culture of Escherichia coli. A clonal population radiated into more than five phenotypic clusters within 26 days, with multiple variations in global regulation, metabolic strategies, surface properties, and nutrient permeability pathways. Most isolates belonged to a single ecotype, and neither periodic selection events nor ecological competition for a single niche prevented an adaptive radiation with a single resource. The multidirectional exploration of fitness space is an underestimated ingredient to bacterial success even in unstructured environments."

https://openalex.org/W2071157004,"Plants provide nourishment for animals and other heterotrophs as the sole primary producer in the food chain. Glutamine synthetase (GS), one of the essential enzymes for plant autotrophy catalyzes the incorporation of ammonia into glutamate to generate glutamine with concomitant hydrolysis of ATP, and plays a crucial role in the assimilation and re-assimilation of ammonia derived from a wide variety of metabolic processes during plant growth and development. Elucidation of the atomic structure of higher plant GS is important to understand its detailed reaction mechanism and to obtain further insight into plant productivity and agronomical utility. Here we report the first crystal structures of maize (Zea mays L.) GS. The structure reveals a unique decameric structure that differs significantly from the bacterial GS structure. Higher plants have several isoenzymes of GS differing in heat stability and catalytic properties for efficient responses to variation in the environment and nutrition. A key residue responsible for the heat stability was found to be Ile-161 in GS1a. The three structures in complex with substrate analogues, including phosphinothricin, a widely used herbicide, lead us to propose a mechanism for the transfer of phosphate from ATP to glutamate and to interpret the inhibitory action of phosphinothricin as a guide for the development of new potential herbicides."

In bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells, Grxs appear to be involved in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. However, in plants, the physiological roles of Grxs have not been fully characterized. Recently, an emerging subgroup of Grxs with one cysteine residue in the putative active motif (monothiol Grxs) has been identified but not well characterized. Here we demonstrate that a plant protein, AtGRXcp, is a chloroplast-localized monothiol Grx with high similarity to yeast Grx5. In yeast expression assays, AtGRXcp localized to the mitochondria and suppressed the sensitivity of yeast grx5 cells to H2O2 and protein oxidation. AtGRXcp expression can also suppress iron accumulation and partially rescue the lysine auxotrophy of yeast grx5 cells. Analysis of the conserved monothiol motif suggests that the cysteine residue affects AtGRXcp expression and stability. In planta, AtGRXcp expression was elevated in young cotyledons, green tissues, and vascular bundles. Analysis of atgrxcp plants demonstrated defects in early seedling growth under oxidative stresses. In addition, atgrxcp lines displayed increased protein carbonylation within chloroplasts.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; PICOT-HD, protein kinase C-interacting cousin of thioredoxin homology domain; Grx, glutaredoxin; Trx, thioredoxin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GUS, β-glucuronidase gene; CaMV, cauliflower mosaic virus promoter.2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; PICOT-HD, protein kinase C-interacting cousin of thioredoxin homology domain; Grx, glutaredoxin; Trx, thioredoxin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GUS, β-glucuronidase gene; CaMV, cauliflower mosaic virus promoter. can be formed as by-products in all oxygenic organisms during aerobic metabolism (1Apel K. Hirt H. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 373-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (7919) Google Scholar). In higher plants, chloroplasts and mitochondria are two major organelles that contribute to production of reactive oxygen species during photosynthesis and carbon metabolism (2Vranová E. Inzé D. Van Breusegem F. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 1227-1236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rhoads D.M. Umbach A.L. Chalivendra S.C. Siedow J.N. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In addition, plants actively generate ROS as signals in response to environmental stresses (3Rhoads D.M. Umbach A.L. Chalivendra S.C. Siedow J.N. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 4Foyer C.H. Noctor G.

Hille J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, because of the cytotoxic and extremely reactive nature of ROS, they can cause wide ranging damage to macromolecules (1Apel K. Hirt H. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 373-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (7919) Google Scholar, 7Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7200) Google Scholar, 8Nyström T.

Chem. 2004; 279: 22204-22208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To overcome such oxidative damage and control signaling events, plants have orchestrated an elaborate antioxidant network (4Foyer C.H. Noctor G. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1866-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar).Of those antioxidant systems, the physiological roles of thioredoxins have been intensively studied (10Buchanan B.B. Balmer Y. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2005; 56: 187-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), whereas those of Grxs have not been fully defined (11Fernandes A.P. Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 12Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Jacquot J.-P. Cell Mol. Life. Sci. 2004; 61: 1266-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Grxs are ubiquitous small heat-stable disulfide oxidoreductases, which are conserved in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (11Fernandes A.P. Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 13Holmgren A. Åslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Through an active motif, namely the conserved CPYC sequence (a dithiol Grx), they catalyze the reduction of protein disulfides and of GSH-protein mixed disulfides via a dithiol or monothiol mechanism (14Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bushweller J.H. Åslund F. Wüthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells, dithiol Grxs appear to be involved in many cellular processes and play an important role in protecting cells against oxidative stresses (16Ortenberg R. Gon S. Porat A. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Grant C.M. Mol.

A. 2005; 102: 8168-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).Besides the dithiol Grxs, a new group of monothiol Grxs has recently been identified in yeast (Grx3, -4, and -5) and bacteria (Grx4) that have a single cysteine residue in the putative active motif (19Rodrígues-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 20Fernandes A.P. Fladvad M. Berndt C. Andrésen C. Lillig C.H. Neubauer P. Sunnerhagen M. Holmgren A. Vlamis-Gardikas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24544-24552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Yeast Grx5 encodes a mitochondrial monothiol Grx, which is required for biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters, whereas Grx3 and Grx4 function in detoxification of cytotoxin and cell proliferation in yeast (21Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 22Jablonowski D. Butler A.R. Fichtner L. Gardiner D. Schaffrath R. Stark M.J.R.

J. 2004; 377: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, bacterial Grx4, unlike other previously characterized Grxs, can serve as a substrate for thioredoxin reductase instead of NADPH/glutathione reductase (20Fernandes A.P. Fladvad M. Berndt C. Andrésen C. Lillig C.H. Neubauer P. Sunnerhagen M. Holmgren A. Vlamis-Gardikas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24544-24552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggesting that those monothiol Grxs have distinct functions. This group of monothiol Grxs is also conserved across organisms and has now been identified in malarial parasites, plants, zebrafish, mice, and humans (24Witte S. Villalba M. Bi K. Liu Y. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 25Rahlfs S. Fischer M. Becker K. J. Biol.

Schmid B. et al.Nature. 2005; 436: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Recent studies also indicate that those Grxs contain a newly identified protein kinase C-interacting cousin of thioredoxin homology domain (PICOT-HD) in their carboxyl-terminal regions (24Witte S. Villalba M. Bi K. Liu Y. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 28Isakov N. Witte S. Altman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 537-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, ascertaining a unifying function of PICOT-HD Grxs has been problematic.Photosynthetic organisms, particularly higher plants, have a large Grx gene family; however, until recently, only a few plant Grxs have been studied (12Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Jacquot J.-P. Cell Mol. Life. Sci. 2004; 61: 1266-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 29Rouhier N. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Lillig C.H. Berndt C. Schwenn J.-D. Holmgren A. Jacquot J.-P. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Lemaire S.D. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the Arabidopsis genome, there are at least 31 open reading frames coding for putative Grxs, which can be divided into three major classes that include the aforementioned monothiol Grxs (12Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Jacquot J.-P. Cell Mol. Life. Sci. 2004; 61: 1266-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 30Lemaire S.D. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of a CC type Grx, ROXY1, indicates an important role of this protein in floral petal development (31Xing S. Rosso M.G. Zachgo S. Development. 2005; 132: 1555-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we used a yeast functional screen to identify a PICOT-HD-containing protein that was able to activate Arabidopsis CAX1 Ca2+/H+ antiport activity in a yeast expression system; this gene was originally termed CXIP1 (26Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6503-6509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here we determine the subcellular localization of this first cloned plant PICOT-HD-containing protein and reclassify the gene as AtGRXcp. We functionally characterize the protein and perform initial structure-function studies using yeast expression assays. We go on to isolate AtGRXcp knock-out mutants and describe the phenotypes of these plants at the whole plant and biochemical levels. For the first time, we demonstrate a role for a plant monothiol Grx.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of AtGRXcp Null Alleles—To isolate atgrxcp alleles, two T-DNA insertional mutant lines were obtained from the SALK T-DNA collection (32Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J. Kim C.J. Chen H. Shinn P. Stevenson D.K. Zimmerman J. Barajas P. Cheuk R. et al.Science. 2003; 301: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4087) Google Scholar). Homozygous plants from each T3 generation were obtained by PCR screening using AtGRXcp-specific and T-DNA border primers. An AtGRXcp reverse primer, 5′-GGG CCG GAT CCT CGA GTC AAG AGC ACA TAG CTT TCT C-3′, and a T-DNA left border primer, 5′-GCG TGG ACC GCT TGC TGC A-3′, were used to screen for the atgrxcp1 allele. The AtGRXcp reverse primer and a T-DNA right border primer, 5′-TGG GAA AAC CTG GCG TTA CCC AAC TTA AT-3′, were used to screen for the atgrxcp2 allele. An AtGRXcp forward primer, 5′-GGC AAG CTT ATA AGT TTT AAT CGT TTA TGG GGT-3′, and the AtGRXcp reverse primer were used to amplify the wild type AtGRXcp gene. The location of the T-DNA insertion was determined by sequencing the PCR product. Both atgrxcp alleles were back-crossed to their respective parental plants to remove any potential unlinked mutations.Plant Growth Conditions—Arabidopsis wild type (ecotype Columbia, Col-0) and atgrxcp mutant seeds were surface-sterilized, germinated, and grown on one-half strength Murashige and Skoog medium (33Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53131) Google Scholar) solidified with 0.8% agar and the same medium supplemented with various concentrations of H2O2. Iron-sufficient and -deficient media were made following a published protocol (34Vert G. Grotz N. Dédaldéchamp F. Gaymard F. Guerinot M.L. Briat J.-F. Curie C. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar).DNA Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Yeast Grx5 was amplified by PCR using a forward primer (5′-GCC GGA TCC ATG TTT CTC CCA AAA TTC AAT-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-CCG GAG CTC TCA ACG ATC TTT GGT TTC TTC-3′), and the PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI). The full-length cDNA of AtGRXcp was isolated through a yeast functional screen and originally termed CXIP1 (for CAX1-interacting protein 1) (26Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6503-6509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). AtGRXcp was predicted to have a 63-amino acid signal peptide by analysis with the Chloro P (version 1.1) program (available on the World Wide Web at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP/). To remove this N-terminal signal peptide, a truncated form of AtGRXcp was amplified by PCR using a forward primer (5′-GGG CTC GAG AGA TCT GCG ATG GCG TCG GCT CTT ACG CCG-3′) and the AtGRXcp reverse primer. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (35Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A forward primer (5′-GAA TCC CGT CTC CCC ATG GCT GGA TTC TCC AAC ACT GTG GTT CAG ATT TTG-3′) and a reverse primer (CGFS; 5′-GAA TTC CGT CTC CAT GGG GAA GTC TCT CGT TCC TTT C-3′) were used for creating the C97A mutation. A forward primer (5′-GAA TCC CGT CTC CCG ATG TGT GGA GCA TCC AAC ACT GTG GTT CAG ATT TTG-3′) and the reverse primer CGFS were used for creating the F99A mutation. The fidelity of all clones was confirmed by sequencing.Yeast Strains, Expression Constructs, and Growth Assays—Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild type strain CML235 (MATa ura3-52 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200), grx5 (MATa ura3-52 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 grx5::kanMX4) were provided by Dr. Enrique Herrero (Universitat de Lleida, Lleida, Spain) and used in all yeast experiments. Yeast Grx5 and AtGRXcp and its variants were cloned into piUGpd (36Nathan D.F. Vos M.H. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed by using the LiOAc method (37Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. ane Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons Inc., Hoboken, NJ1996: 13.7.1-13.7.5Google Scholar). All yeast strains were assayed on YPD medium (yeast peptone dextrose, rich medium), with or without various concentrations of H2O2, and SC medium plus six amino acids or five amino acids without lysine (21Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 26Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6503-6509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Localization of AtGRXcp-Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Fusions in Yeast and Plant Cells—Full-length and truncated AtGRXcp and its variants were fused to the N terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFP) using a procedure described previously (38Cheng N.-H. Liu J.-Z. Nelson R.S. Hirschi K.D. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The GFP constructs were subcloned into yeast and plant expression vectors as described previously (38Cheng N.-H. Liu J.-Z. Nelson R.S. Hirschi K.D. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of the fused proteins was imaged in comparison with labeled organelle markers (chloroplasts, mitochondria, Golgi, and peroxisome) as described previously (38Cheng N.-H. Liu J.-Z. Nelson R.S. Hirschi K.D. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A peroxisome-targeted DsRed (red fluorescent protein), DsRed-per, was constructed by adding the plant peroxisome-targeting signal, KSRM, to the end of DsRed (39Trelease R.N. Lee M.S. Banjoko A. Bunkelmann J. Proto-plasma. 1995; 195: 156-167Google Scholar). The fluorescence signals were detected at 510 nm (excitation at 488 nm) for GFP, at 582 nm (excitation at 543 nm) for DsRed, and at 660 nm (excitation at 633 nm) for chlorophyll using Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal laser-scanning microscope. The fluorescence intensities were quantified by using the LCS software.AtGRXcp::GUS Transgenic Plants—A 397-bp DNA sequence upstream of ATG of AtGRXcp open reading frames was amplified from genomic DNA by using the following primer sets: forward primer (5′-GGC AAG CTT ATA AGT TTT AAT CGT TTA TGG GGT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GCC TCT AGA TTT TGA CGA CTT TTA GAT TTG GAA-3′). The PCR fragment was cloned into pBI121 to replace the 35S CaMV promoter, resulting in plasmid pAtGRXcp::GUS. Agrobacterium transformation of Arabidopsis plants was performed as described previously (40Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Barkla B.J. Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). More than 50 T2 generation plants were selected for Kan resistance.Protein Oxidation Analysis—Carbonyl assays for analysis of oxidized proteins in both yeast and plant cells were performed as previously described (19Rodrígues-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 41Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E.

Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 268-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Yeast cultures of the strains (CML235 and grx5) expressing vector, Grx5, and AtGRXcp were grown in YPD media overnight at 30 °C. Half of the culture of each strain was subjected to treatment with 5 mm H2O2 for 1 h. Total proteins were extracted from cells with and without treatment. Western blot analysis was used to determine carbonyl group content. Arabidopsis chloroplasts were isolated from photosynthetic tissues of 6-week-old flowering wild type-, atgrxcp-, and AtGRXcp-overexpressing plants (43Fitzpatrick L.M. Keegstra K. Plant J. 2001; 27: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The oxidized proteins were detected by protein gel blotting using anti-dinitrophenylhydrazone antibody (42Davletova S. Rizhsky L. Liang H. Zhong S. Oliver D.J. Coutu J. Shulaey V. Schlauch K. Mittler R. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 268-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) (Bethyl Laboratory, Montgomery, TX).Measurement of Iron Concentration—Yeast strains (CML235 and grx5) expressing vector, Grx5, and AtGRXcp were grown in 50 ml of selection media (-Ura) overnight at 30 °C. Each yeast culture was inoculated into 300 ml of YPD medium and grown until an A600 of 1.0 was reached. Yeast cells were harvested and washed and dried at 70 °C and subjected to inductively coupled plasma spectrometry analysis (44Havlin J.L. Soltanpour P.N. Commun. Soil Sci. Plant Anal. 1989; 14: 969-980Google Scholar). To determine the soluble iron concentration, cells were sonicated and broken with a Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher), and the intracellular iron content was examined with a QuantiChron™ iron assay kit (Bio-Assay Systems, Hayward, CA).RESULTSAtGRXcp Is a Member of the Monothiol Glutaredoxins—CXIP1 (CAX-interacting protein 1; accession number AY157988) was originally identified based on its function in a yeast assay (26Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6503-6509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); however, we propose that CXIP1 should be reclassified as AtGRXcp. Our computational analysis revealed that AtGRXcp is similar to yeast monothiol Grxs (Grx3, -4, and -5), bacterial Grx4, PfGLP-1 from a malarial parasite, and both zebrafish and mice Grx5 (Fig. 1). This group of monothiol Grxs also contains a PICOT-HD, which is conserved in PICOTs from mammalian cells and plants (28Isakov N. Witte S. Altman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 537-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Several Grxs, like yeast Grx3 and -4, and human PICOT, have an N-terminal extension; however, AtGRXcp, similar to the bacterial Grx4, and both yeast and zebrafish Grx5, does not contain the N-terminal extension (Fig. 1) (19Rodrígues-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 20Fernandes A.P. Fladvad M. Berndt C. Andrésen C. Lillig C.H. Neubauer P.

Fraenkel P. Axe J.L. Weber G.J. Dooley K. Davidson A.J. Schmid B. et al.Nature. 2005; 436: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In addition, our analysis suggests that in higher plants, these monothiol Grxs exist in both monocots and dicots (Fig. 1). In Arabidopsis, there are four members of these Grxs (Fig. 1). A dithiol Grx has two cysteine residues in the active motif that are able to catalyze protein disulfides and GSH-protein mixed disulfides (11Fernandes A.P. Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 17Grant C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 18Lillig C.H. Berndt C. Vergnolle O. Lönn M.E. Hudemann C. Bill E. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8168-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar); however, the subfamily of Grxs has only one conserved cysteine residue in the putative active motif, termed “CGFS” (Fig. 1). These observations indicate that monothiol Grxs are also conserved throughout prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Fig. 1). Based on the sequence analysis of those Grxs, we conclude that AtGRXcp is the first cloned plant monothiol Grx.AtGRXcp Is a Chloroplast-localized Monothiol Grx—Monothiol Grxs have a diverse subcellular distribution in multiple organisms. For example, yeast Grx5 is mitochondria-localized (21Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and Grx3 targets to nuclei (45Molina M.M. Bellí G. de la Torre M.A. Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Herrero E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51923-51930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas a human PICOT is located in the cytosol (24Witte S. Villalba M. Bi K. Liu Y. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In order to gain insight into the function of AtGRXcp, we fused it with GFP at its C terminus and transiently expressed this fusion protein in tobacco leaf cells. Using various organelle markers, AtGRXcp-GFP was shown to clearly target to chloroplasts rather than mitochondria, Golgi, or peroxisomes in mesophyll cells (Fig. 2A). Analysis of the AtGRXcp sequence predicts that a 63-amino acid signal peptide is present at the N terminus (data not shown). To experimentally verify this, we removed this putative signal peptide and fused the truncated AtGRXcp (AtGRXcpΔ63) with GFP for transient expression in tobacco cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, AtGRXcpΔ63-GFP no longer targeted to chloroplasts and instead was dispersed throughout the cytosol and nuclei, similar to observations with free GFP (Fig. 2B, data not shown).FIGURE 2Subcellular localization of AtGRXcp-GFP in plant cells. A, AtGRXcp-GFP is localized to chloroplasts in tobacco cells. The left panels display the transient expression of AtGRXcp-GFP in tobacco cells; central panels display fluorescence from individually labeled markers for plant organelles or fluorescing chloroplasts; and right panels show the merged images. B, a truncated AtGRXcp-GFP fusion is not targeting to chloroplasts.

Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 21Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). To examine if AtGRXcp could restore Grx5 function and suppress the sensitivity of grx5 cells to an external oxidant, H2O2, we expressed vector control, AtGRXcp, and yeast endogenous Grx5 in grx5 cells. All yeast strains grew normally in YPD liquid media (rich media) after 48 h of growth (Fig. 3A). Whereas vector-expressing grx5 cells were growth-impaired in the medium with 3 mm H2O2, both AtGRXcp- and Grx5-expressing grx5 cells grew in a similar manner to wild type cells (Fig. 3A). These observations suggest that AtGRXcp is able to suppress the sensitivity of grx5 cells to oxidative stress.FIGURE 3AtGRXcp is able to suppress the sensitivity of grx5 cells to H2O2. A and B, vector-expressing wild type cells and vector-, AtGRXcp-, AtGRXcp-GFP-, AtGRXcpΔ63-, AtGRXcpΔ63-GFP-, and Grx5-expressing grx5 cells were grown in YPD liquid media and the same media supplemented with 3.0 mm H2O2. Cell density was measured at A600 after 48 h of growth at 30 °C. Shown are two representative experiments from four independent experiments conducted. The bars indicate the S.E. (n = 8).

Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), the suppression of grx5 phenotypes mandates that the subcellular localization of AtGRXcp in yeast cells differs from that seen in plants. To investigate this, AtGRXcp-GFP was expressed in yeast cells. Yeast growth assays revealed that AtGRXcp-GFP was functional and could suppress the sensitivity of grx5 cells to H2O2 (Fig. 3B). Through immunolabeling studies, AtGRXcp-GFP localized to mitochondria in yeast cells, whereas a truncated AtGRXcpΔ63-GFP was unable to target to this organelle (Fig. 3C). Targeting of AtGRXcp to mitochondria was essential for the function of this protein in yeast, since both AtGRXcpΔ63 and AtGRXcpΔ63-GFP were unable to suppress the sensitivity of grx5 cells to H2O2 (Fig. 3, A and B).AtGRXcp Is Able to Protect Cells against Protein Oxidation and Rescue the Lysine Auxotrophy of a Yeast grx5 Mutant—In grx5 cells, total protein carbonyl content is significantly increased under oxidative stress (Fig. 4A), suggesting that yeast Grx5 plays a vital role in directly protecting enzymes from oxidative damages (19Rodrígues-Manzaneque M.T.

https://openalex.org/W1969412813,"The pikromycin (Pik)/methymycin biosynthetic pathway of <i>Streptomyces venezuelae</i> represents a valuable system for dissecting the fundamental mechanisms of modular polyketide biosynthesis, aminodeoxysugar assembly, glycosyltransfer, and hydroxylation leading to the production of a series of macrolide antibiotics, including the natural ketolides narbomycin and pikromycin. In this study, we describe four x-ray crystal structures and allied functional studies for PikC, the remarkable P450 monooxygenase responsible for production of a number of related macrolide products from the Pik pathway. The results provide important new insights into the structural basis for the C10/C12 and C12/C14 hydroxylation patterns for the 12-(YC-17) and 14-membered ring (narbomycin) macrolides, respectively. This includes two different ligand-free structures in an asymmetric unit (resolution 2.1 Å) and two co-crystal structures with bound endogenous substrates YC-17 (resolution 2.35 Å)or narbomycin (resolution 1.7 Å). A central feature of the enzyme-substrate interaction involves anchoring of the desosamine residue in two alternative binding pockets based on a series of distinct amino acid residues that form a salt bridge and a hydrogen-bonding network with the deoxysugar C3′ dimethylamino group. Functional significance of the salt bridge was corroborated by site-directed mutagenesis that revealed a key role for Glu-94 in YC-17 binding and Glu-85 for narbomycin binding. Taken together, the x-ray structure analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and corresponding product distribution studies reveal that PikC substrate tolerance and product diversity result from a combination of alternative anchoring modes rather than an induced fit mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2171277628,"Animal studies reveal that fasting and caloric restriction produce increased activity of specific metabolic pathways involved in resistance to weight loss in liver. Evidence suggests that this phenomenon may in part occur through the action of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3). Currently, the precise molecular mechanisms that activate CAR during fasting are unknown. We show that fasting coordinately induces expression of genes encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), CAR, cytochrome P-450 2b10 (Cyp2b10), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1a1 (Ugt1a1), sulfotransferase 2a1 (Sult2a1), and organic anion-transporting polypeptide 2 (Oatp2) in liver in mice. Treatments that elevate intracellular cAMP levels also produce increased expression of these genes in cultured hepatocytes. Our data show that PGC-1α interaction with hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α, NR2A1) directly regulates CAR gene expression through a novel and evolutionarily conserved HNF4-response element (HNF4-RE) located in its proximal promoter. Expression of PGC-1α in cells increases CAR expression and ligand-independent CAR activity. Genetic studies reveal that hepatic expression of HNF4α is required to produce fasting-inducible CAR expression and activity. Taken together, our data show that fasting produces increased expression of genes encoding key metabolic enzymes and an uptake transporter protein through a network of interactions involving cAMP, PGC-1α, HNF4α, CAR, and CAR target genes in liver. Given the recent finding that mice lacking CAR exhibit a profound decrease in resistance to weight loss during extended periods of caloric restriction, our findings have important implications in the development of drugs for the treatment of obesity and related diseases.

Given the recent finding that mice lacking CAR exhibit a profound decrease in resistance to weight loss during extended periods of caloric restriction, our findings have important implications in the development of drugs for the treatment of obesity and related diseases. Energy homeostasis must be tightly regulated. In humans, long term energy imbalance can lead to various diseases (1Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 2Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S.

For example, obesity develops when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure over time. On the other hand, cachexia results when energy expenditure exceeds energy intake over a period of time. During caloric restriction or fasting, mammals exhibit a significant decrease in basal metabolic rate in an effort to maintain energy homeostasis and prolong life. It has been shown that starvation can decrease the basal metabolic rate as much as 40% (4Blaxter K. Energy Metabolism in Animals and Man. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1989Google Scholar). Although the decrease in basal metabolic rate represents a defense mechanism for mammals to survive during times of food shortage, it also creates a barrier to weight loss in obese individuals during caloric restriction.

THs are synthesized by the thyroid gland and are metabolized in peripheral tissues. The major forms of THs are thyroxine (T4) and triidothyronine (T3), with T3 being the biologically active form. T3 performs its function primarily through its agonist activity against the thyroid hormone receptor (5Harvey C.B. Williams G.R. Thyroid. 2002; 12: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. T3 is derived from T4 through outer ring deiodination catalyzed by type I deiodinase (6Bianco A.C. Salvatore D. Gereben B. Berry M.J. Larsen P.R. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 38-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). This enzyme also catalyzes inner ring deiodination, thereby producing the inactive reverse T3. When T4 is sulfated by the hepatic sulfotransferases (SULTs), the outer ring deiodination becomes undetectable, while the rate of the inner ring deiodination increases over 100-fold (7Mol J.A. Visser T.J. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, hepatic SULTs are extremely important in the regulation of levels and activity of THs. In addition to sulfation, conjugation by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), specifically the UGT1 family members, also regulates circulating TH levels (8Burchell B. Coughtrie M.W. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 43: 261-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Conjugation of a glucuronide moiety by UGTs in liver increases the water solubility of THs, leading to increased TH excretion in bile. Plasma TH levels decrease dramatically during fasting (9Maglich J.M. Watson J. McMillen P.J. Goodwin B. Willson T.M. Moore J.T. J. Biol.

CAR is mainly expressed in liver in mice, where it regulates many Phase I and Phase II biotransforming enzymes, including Cyp2b10, Sult2a1, SultN, and Ugt1a1.

In addition to drug transport and metabolism, these proteins are also involved in the metabolism, transport, and excretion of THs and other endobiotic compounds, including many steroids and bile acids. Using CAR-knock-out mice, it has been clearly demonstrated that both TH-metabolizing genes are increased and serum TH levels are decreased in a CAR-dependent manner during fasting in mice (9Maglich J.M. Watson J. McMillen P.J. Goodwin B. Willson T.M. Moore J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19832-19838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CAR activation and induction of CAR target genes during fasting remain totally unknown. The intracellular concentration of cAMP rises during fasting. Therefore, we hypothesized that the activation of CAR during fasting is a cAMP-dependent phenomenon. In this report, we show that both CAR target genes, including Cyp2b10, Oatp2, Sult2a1, and Ugt1a1, as well as the CAR gene itself, are induced in mouse liver during fasting. Treatment of primary mouse hepatocytes with the β-adrenergic agonist epinephrine also induces both CAR and CAR target genes. This effect is mimicked by the cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP. Reporter gene studies demonstrate that the CAR promoter is regulated by the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α). Furthermore, the fasting- and cAMP-inducible coactivator PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) coactivates HNF4α on the CAR promoter. Gel mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that HNF4α directly regulates the CAR promoter through an evolutionarily conserved consensus HNF4α response element (HNF4-RE) identified in the mouse and human CAR promoters. In addition we show that PGC-1α coactivates CAR on the native Cyp2b10 promoter. Additional fasting experiments performed using liver-specific HNF4α-knock-out (HNF4α-KO) mice demonstrate that HNF4α is required in vivo for both basal and fasting-inducible CAR gene expression. Moreover, these experiments reveal that HNF4α is required to produce induction of known CAR target genes, including Cyp2b10, Oatp2, Sult2a1, and Ugt1a1. Our results suggest that fasting mediates CAR activation by increasing CAR gene expression and ligand-independent CAR activity. Our results further suggest that increased intracellular cAMP concentration play a key role in regulating a network of interactions involving PGC-1α, HNF4α, CAR, and CAR target genes in liver.

About 48 h post-plating, hepatocytes were treated with drugs or previously described adenoviral expression vectors in maintenance medium for a period of time as indicated in the Figs. before RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (10 μg/lane) was resolved on 3.7% formaldehyde 1% agarose gel to verify the integrity of the RNA. One microgram of DNaseI-treated RNA was reverse-transcribed using random primers following the manufacturer's instruction (Promega). Equal amounts of cDNA were used in real-time quantitative PCR reactions. Reactions included 200 nm fluorogenic probe and 300 nm primers specific for each gene.

Briefly, each well was transfected with 20 ng of the reporter gene Cyp2b10-LUC, 5 ng of pSG5-mCAR, 0-10 ng of pcDNA-mPGC-1α, and 40 ng of SV-β-gal and added with pBluescript to 110 ng of total DNA per well. CAR promoter analysis was performed on the following website: polly.wustl.edu/promolign/showSVG.asp?ortholog_id=ortho_537. To screen for transcription factors that transactivate mouse CAR promoter with PGC-1α, each well was transfected with 20 ng of the 4.6-CAR-LUC reporter gene, 5 ng of expression vector for the transcription factor, 10 ng of pcDNA or pcDNA-mPGC-1α, and 40 ng of pSV-β-GAL (Invitrogen) and added with pBluescript to 110 ng of total DNA per well. 24 h post-transfection, cells were drug-treated for 24 h. The luciferase activities were determined using the luciferase assay system per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) and normalized to β-galactosidase activities. β-Galactosidase activities were measured using an o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) assay (Sigma). For the ONPG assay, 110 mg of ONPG was dissolved in 100 ml of 0.1 m NaHPO4 buffer, which was made by mixing 6.84 ml of 1 m Na2HPO4, 3.16 ml of 1 m NaH2PO4, and 90 ml of H2O. 20 μl of cell lysate and 200 μl of ONPG buffer was mixed, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30-60 min and read at 420 nm. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Human HNF4α protein was synthesized in vitro using the TnT rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each gel mobility shift assay contained 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 60 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 3 μl of in vitro translated HNF4α protein or unprogrammed cell lysate as a control. Competitor oligonucleotides were included at 25-, 50-, or 100-fold excess as indicated in the Figs.. After 10-min incubation on ice, 10 ng of 32P-labled oligonucleotide was added. After an additional 10-min incubation on ice, DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (1× TBE contains 90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA). Gels were dried at 70 °C for 2 h and subjected to autoradiography at -70 °C overnight. The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used either as radiolabeled probes or as non-radioactive competitors: CAR-HNF4-RE, 5′-GATCACACCCAGGTCTTTGCCCTGGGTCC-3′; mutant CAR-HNF4-RE, 5′-GATCACACCCATTTCTTTTTCCTG- GGTCC-3′; and CYP7A-HNF4-RE (34Stroup D. Chiang J.Y. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 5′-GATCCTATGGACTTAGTTCAAGGCCG-3′. The bolded sequences are the predicted consensus HNF4α-binding sites. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—50 mg of adult mouse liver was passed through a 19-gauge needle, then a 21-gauge needle, in 1 ml of hepatocyte plating medium to make the tissue suspension. DNA-protein cross-linking was performed by incubating liver tissue suspension with formaldehyde at a final concentration of 1% for 10-15 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking. Adding glycine to 0.125 m terminated the cross-linking reaction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μg of anti-human HNF4α mouse monoclonal antibody (Clone K9218, Perseus Proteomics Inc.) or control antibody anti-FLAG M2 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used for immunoprecipitation. Precipitated DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Purified DNA was dissolved in 20 μl of water. 2 μl of DNA was PCR-amplified using Ex-taq (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Japan) for 45 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and then 68 °C for 30 s). Non-precipitated genomic DNA was included as input control. The following primers were used: CAR-159/+140, forward primer (CTCACCCACAGGGAAATCCTCC), reverse primer (CTGACCCTGCTTTCCTTGAGATC); CAR-1351/-1031, forward primer (CTGCTAATCTGTGAACTGTACTGC), reverse primer (CAACCCTGATACCTGGTGCCAG); mouse proline oxidase (PO)-250/+24 primers were described previously (35Kamiya A. Inoue Y. Kodama T. Gonzalez F.J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Co-regulation of PGC-1α, CAR, and CAR Target Genes by Fasting, Epinephrine, and cAMP—The induction of Cyp2b10, Sult2a1, and Ugt1a1 has been well characterized in mouse liver following fasting (9Maglich J.M.

Because PGC-1α is a fasting-inducible protein cofactor that interacts with multiple nuclear receptors, and because it was recently demonstrated that PGC-1α coactivates a chimerical GAL4-CAR fusion protein on the artificial luciferase reporter gene UAS-LUC (36Shiraki T. Sakai N. Kanaya E. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11344-11350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the induction of CAR target genes by fasting was mediated through interaction between CAR and PGC-1α in liver. To investigate the plausibility of our hypothesis, we measured the mRNA levels of PGC-1α, Cyp2b10, Sult2a1, and Ugt1a1 in mouse livers following 24-h fasting by real-time quantitative PCR. As expected, the expression of PGC-1α, Cyp2b10, Sult2a1, and Ugt1a1 were all increased following a period of 24-h fasting (Fig. 1). In addition, we found that fasting produced an increase in the expression of the Oatp2 gene. Because Cyp2b10, Sult2a1, Ugt1a1, and Oatp2 are co-regulated by PXR and CAR, we measured the levels of PXR and CAR mRNA following fasting. Interestingly, the level of CAR expression was dramatically increased in mouse liver following fasting, whereas the level of PXR mRNA remained unchanged. Fasting produces increased intracellular concentrations of cAMP in liver through the action of the G-protein-coupled receptor ligands epinephrine and glucagon. We therefore hypothesized that the induction of CAR and CAR target genes in hepatocytes is a cAMP-dependent phenomenon. To test this hypothesis, we first treated primary mouse hepatocytes with epinephrine. Epinephrine treatment produced increases in PGC-1α, CAR, and all CAR target genes tested, including Cyp2b10, Sult2a1, Ugt1a1, and Oatp2 (Fig. 2). Epinephrine treatment had no effect upon the expression of the pxr gene (data not shown). We next sought to determine both the time course and the extent to which induction of PGC-1α, CAR, and CAR target gene expression in hepatocytes is dependent upon increased cAMP concentrations. We therefore treated primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes with 8-Br-cAMP, the cell-permeable/PKA-activating cAMP analogue. Kinetic analysis revealed that 8-Br-cAMP treatment produced increased PGC-1α gene expression very early. The level of PGC-1α expression was near its maximum by the 4-h time point, and it remained elevated through the 48-h time point (Fig. 3A). Induction of CAR gene expression was not observed until the 24-h time point and continued increasing through the 48-h time point. The induction of Cyp2b10, the prototypical CAR target gene, was maximized after the 48-h time point, but was still observable at 24-h time point. A similar kinetic pattern of induction was observed with all other CAR target genes investigated (Table 1). This kinetic pattern of gene expression in which PGC-1α levels increase early, followed by CAR, followed by all CAR target genes examined led to the hypothesis that increased PGC-1α produces increased CAR expression and activity.TABLE 1Time-dependent induction of PGC-1α, CAR, and CAR target genes by 8-Br-cAMPTime4 h8 h24 h48 h-fold induction (±S.E.)PGC-1α37.3 (1.3)55 (1.6)43.7 (1.3)61 (3.9)CAR0.8 (0.2)0.8 (0.2)10.9 (0.5)25.7 (1.0)Cyp2b100.8 (0.1)1.3 (0.1)3 (0.1)151.4 (11.0)OatP22.5 (0.3)12.3 (0.4)16 (1.1)169.4 (4.2)Sult2a11.6 (0.5)37.9 (3.0)29.9 (2.0)98.1 (7.6)Ugt1a10.8 (0.0)1.8 (0.0)1.7 (0.0)18.5 (0.6) Open table in a new tab To determine the extent to which the intracellular cAMP signal transduction pathway is specifically linked to increased expression of CAR in liver, we also measured the mRNA levels of PXR and GR following 24 h of treatment of cultured hepatocytes with 8-Br-cAMP. As shown in Fig. 3B, the expression of CAR was induced by treatment with 8-Br-cAMP, whereas PXR and GR mRNA levels were unaffected. To determine whether PXR is directly involved in the response to cAMP, we treated primary cultures of hepatocytes isolated from wild-type and PXR-knock-out mice with 8-Br-cAMP for 24 h and investigated the induction of Cyp2b10 gene expression. The induction of Cyp2b10 and CAR gene expression produced by 8-Br-cAMP remained intact in PXR-KO hepatocytes (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that the transcriptional response to increased intracellular cAMP is CAR-specific and that increased Cyp2b10 expression following activation of the PKA signaling pathway is a PXR-independent phenomenon. Regulation of CAR Promoter Activity by HNF4α and PGC-1α—It is well characterized that fasting induces PGC-1α gene expression through the PKA signal transduction pathway (37Herzig S. Long F.

Following sister chromatid separation, however, the checkpoint ignores chromosomes whose kinetochores are attached to only one spindle pole, a state that activates the checkpoint prior to metaphase. We demonstrate that, in budding yeast, mutual inhibition between the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and Mps1, an essential component of the checkpoint, leads to sustained inactivation of the spindle checkpoint. Mps1 protein abundance decreases in anaphase, and Mps1 is a target of the APC. Furthermore, expression of Mps1 in anaphase, or repression of the APC in anaphase, reactivates the spindle checkpoint. This APC-Mps1 feedback circuit allows cells to irreversibly inactivate the checkpoint during anaphase."

The SREBP family of transcription factors consists of three different SREBP proteins; SREBP1a, SREBP1c, and SREBP2. The SREBPs are synthesized as large precursor proteins that are inserted into the nuclear and endoplasmic reticulum membranes and are transcriptionally inactive (3Espenshade P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 973-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In sterol-depleted cells, SREBPs are processed sequentially by two membrane-associated proteases that release the mature form of the proteins (4Rawson R.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

These transcriptionally active fragments of the SREBPs are translocated to the nucleus and bind to the promoters of SREBP target genes (6Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin.

Many transcription factors, particularly those involved in the control of cell growth, are unstable proteins targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (13Conaway R.C. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Science. 2002; 296: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Numerous observations have pointed to the existence of a close connection between the ubiquitin-proteasome system and transcriptional activation (14Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

It has been demonstrated that the sequences that specify proteolysis of some activators overlap with their transcriptional activation domains and that components of the proteasome can be recruited to promoters through interactions with transcriptional regulators (16Molinari E.

Nature. 2005; 438: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic link between the transcriptional activity of transcription factors and their degradation has been unclear. The transcriptionally active forms of SREBPs are degraded by the proteasome in a ubiquitination-dependent manner (12Hirano Y. Yoshida M. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36431-36437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that nuclear SREBP molecules are, at least in part, ubiquitinated and degraded as a functional consequence of their transcriptional activity (20Sundqvist A. Ericsson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13833-13838Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recently, a phosphodegron in SREBP1a that serves as a recognition motif for the SCFFbw7 ubiquitin ligase was described (8Sundqvist A. Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Ye X. Lukiyanchuk V. Jin J. Harper J.W. Ericsson J. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Fbw7 interacts with nuclear SREBP1a and enhances its ubiquitination and degradation in a manner dependent on the phosphorylation of Thr426 and Ser430 within its phosphodegron by GSK-3β. However, the signals regulating the phosphorylation of the phosphodegron in SREBP1 and its interactions with Fbw7 have been largely unknown. We now demonstrate that the GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of the phosphodegron in SREBP1 is enhanced in response to specific DNA binding, both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, we demonstrate that GSK-3β is recruited to the promoters of SREBP target genes in vivo. Consequently, Fbw7 is recruited to SREBP target promoters and induces the ubiquitination and degradation of SREBP. Thus, DNA binding provides a link between the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of active SREBP1. Cell Culture—All of the tissue culture media and antibiotics were obtained from Invitrogen and Sigma. 293T, 293, HeLa, and HepG2 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection.

Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—The cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 1% aprotinin, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and cleared by centrifugation. For DNAP and co-immunoprecipitation assays, the cell lysates were prepared in the absence of SDS and sodium deoxycholate. The cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS/PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). Luciferase and β-Galactosidase Assays—The cells were transiently transfected with the indicated promoter-reporter gene. Luciferase activities were determined in duplicate samples as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). The cells were also transfected with the β-galactosidase gene as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Luciferase values (relative light units) were calculated by dividing the luciferase activity by the β-galactosidase activity. The data represent the averages ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. DNAP Assays—The cell lysates were precleared with streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) and subsequently used in DNAP assays as described previously (20Sundqvist A. Ericsson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13833-13838Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The biotinylated double-stranded DNA was composed of the sterol regulatory element 1 sequence (5′-ATCACCCCAC-3′) from the LDL receptor promoter or the entire proximal region of the LDL receptor promoter. DNA-bound proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C, washed, and analyzed by Western blotting. For Fbw7 interaction studies, the precipitated proteins were incubated with cell lysates from 293 cells transfected with empty vector or GST-Fbw7α, washed, and analyzed by Western blotting. In Vitro Kinase Assays—Recombinant His6-SREBP1a was incubated in kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP) in the absence or presence of HeLa nuclear extract (3.5 μg) and a plasmid DNA template containing the proximal region of the HMG-CoA synthase promoter (SYNSRE-luc, 0.1 μg) or a PCR product containing the same promoter region for 1 h at 30°C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer, and the reaction products were separated on SDS/PAGE. The levels and phosphorylation of SREBP1 were determined by Western blotting. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assays—For ubiquitination assays, the in vitro kinase assays were supplemented with E1 (0.1 μg; Biomol), UbcH3 (0.1 μg; Biomol), ubiquitin (10 μg; Sigma), ubiquitin aldehyde (2 μm; Biomol), and MG132 (100 μm; Sigma) and incubated for 1 h at 30 °Cinthe absence or presence of in vitro translated Fbw7α. ChIP Assays—The ChIP assays were performed with the indicated antibodies as described previously (9Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Punga T. Ericsson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11681-11686Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The PCR amplifications were performed in the presence of 1 μCi of [32P]dCTP and analyzed in 6% polyacrylamide gels. The PCR conditions were optimized to remain in the linear range of amplification. The sequences of the primers used for the various promoters are available on request. SREBP1 Is Hyperphosphorylated in Response to DNA Binding—In an attempt to identify nuclear factors targeting SREBP1, we performed in vitro kinase assays using recombinant mature SREBP1a and HeLa nuclear extracts. We found that the migration of mature SREBP1a in SDS/PAGE was dramatically shifted to higher molecular species when the kinase assay was supplemented with a promoter-reporter gene containing SREBP-binding sites (Fig. 1A). Similar results were also obtained with mature SREBP2 (Fig. 1B). The shift in apparent molecular weight of SREBP1a in response to DNA binding was reversed by λ-phosphatase treatment (Fig. 1C), indicating that mature SREBP1a is hyperphosphorylated in response to DNA binding. To test this hypothesis, the kinase assay was repeated with a mutant SREBP1 protein unable to bind DNA (DBD–/–). The DBD–/– protein was not phosphorylated following the addition of DNA (Fig. 1D), indicating that DNA binding promotes the phosphorylation of SREBP1a by a kinase present in HeLa nuclear extracts. This idea was supported by our observation that SREBP1a was phosphorylated in response to oligonucleotides containing a wild type SREBP-binding site, but not if the site was mutated so that SREBP1a could no longer bind (Fig. 1E). The Phosphodegron in SREBP1 Is Phosphorylated in Response to DNA Binding—In an attempt to identify the residues in SREBP1 phosphorylated in response to DNA binding, the kinase assay was performed in the presence of [32P]ATP. Phospho-amino acid analysis of the labeled SREBP1a protein revealed that phosphorylation of serine residues was the dominating modification, with a small amount of radioactivity associated with phospho-threonine (supplemental Fig. S1). Preliminary phospho-peptide mapping of tryptic peptides confirmed that SREBP1a was phosphorylated on multiple residues in response to DNA binding and indicated that a number of the phosphorylated residues resided in the C-terminal domain of mature SREBP1, including Thr426 and Ser430 in the Fbw7-dependent phosphodegron (not shown). To confirm that the C-terminal domain in SREBP1a was phosphorylated in response to DNA binding, wild type SREBP1a and mutant proteins in which either the N- or C-terminal domains were deleted were used for in vitro kinase assays. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, deletion of the N terminus (ΔN; deletion of amino acid residues 1–90) did not affect the shift in molecular weight in response to DNA binding. However, deletion of the C-terminal domain (ΔC; deletion of amino acid residues 418–490) blocked the shift almost completely, indicating that the major phosphorylation sites reside in the C-terminal domain. To understand how DNA binding promotes the phosphorylation of SREBP1, we needed to establish the timing of phosphorylation relative to DNA binding. To address this issue, recombinant SREBP1a was incubated in the presence of DNA for various times, and the phosphorylation of the Fbw7-dependent phosphodegron was detected with phosphorylation-specific antibodies directed against phospho-Thr426 (pT426) and phospho-Ser430 (pS430). In parallel experiments, the total phosphorylation of SREBP1a in response to DNA binding was monitored in the presence of [32P]ATP. In addition, the DNA binding activity of recombinant SREBP1a was monitored over time in electromobility shift assays. As illustrated in Fig. 2B, the overall phosphorylation of SREBP1a in response to DNA binding was rapid and followed the same time course as DNA binding. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of both Thr426 and Ser430 was enhanced dramatically in response to the addition of DNA. However, the phosphorylation of both residues was delayed relative to DNA binding, suggesting that DNA binding alone may not be sufficient to induce the phosphorylation of these two residues. These results demonstrate that SREBP1a is rapidly hyperphosphorylated in response to DNA binding. The data also suggest that Thr426 and Ser430 in the Fbw7-dependent phosphodegron are phosphorylated in response to DNA binding. To confirm that Thr426 and Ser430 in SREBP1 were phosphorylated in a DNA -binding-dependent manner, the phosphorylation of recombinant SREBP1a, either wild type or a mutant unable to bind DNA (DBD–/–) was analyzed with antibodies directed against pT426 and pS430. The phosphorylation of both residues was enhanced in wild type SREBP1a in response to DNA binding, whereas the DBD–/– mutant was not phosphorylated (Fig. 2C), confirming that the phosphodegron in SREBP1 is phosphorylated in a DNA binding-dependent manner. When expressed in cells, the DBD–/– mutant accumulates to high levels, presumably as a result of inefficient ubiquitin-dependent degradation (20Sundqvist A. Ericsson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13833-13838Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). When similar levels of wild type and DBD–/– SREBP1a protein were expressed in 293T cells, the DBD–/– mutant migrated slightly faster than the wild type protein (Fig. 2D), indicating a difference in phosphorylation. Indeed, the phosphorylation of both Thr426 and Ser430 was significantly reduced in the DBD–/– mutant when compared with the wild type protein (Fig. 2D), suggesting that DNA binding contributes to the phosphorylation of the phosphodegron in SREBP1 in vivo. The minor phosphorylation signals seen with the DBD–/– protein indicate that DNA binding may not be the only requirement for phosphorylation in vivo. Taken together, our results indicate that SREBP1 is phosphorylated on multiple C-terminal amino acid residues in response to DNA binding. Two of these residues, Thr426 and Ser430, reside in the phosphodegron of SREBP1. The identification of all the residues in SREBP1 that are phosphorylated under these conditions will be a major future challenge. In the current study, we will focus on the phosphorylation of Thr426 and Ser430 because of the critical importance of these residues in the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of SREBP1 (8Sundqvist A. Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Ye X. Lukiyanchuk V. Jin J. Harper J.W. Ericsson J. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). GSK-3 Is Involved in the DNA Binding-dependent Phosphorylation of SREBP1—It has been shown that Thr426 and Ser430 can be phosphorylated by GSK-3β, both in vitro and in vivo (8Sundqvist A. Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Ye X. Lukiyanchuk V. Jin J. Harper J.W. Ericsson J. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus, we wanted to determine whether GSK-3β was involved in the DNA binding-dependent phosphorylation of these residues. The phosphorylation of both Thr426 and Ser430 in response to DNA binding was attenuated in the presence of lithium, a pharmacologic GSK-3 inhibitor (Fig. 3A). The phosphorylation of Thr426 and Ser430 was also attenuated in the presence of SB-415286, a specific GSK-3 inhibitor (supplemental Fig. S2). The effect was specific, because none of the other kinase inhibitors tested had any significant effect on the phosphorylation of these residues in response to DNA binding (supplemental Fig. S2). To further test the role of GSK-3 in the DNA-dependent phosphorylation of Thr426 and Ser430, nuclear extracts were prepared from cells transfected with either control siRNA or siRNA directed against GSK-3α and GSK-3β. As illustrated in Fig. 3B, the phosphorylation of both residues was decreased in response to siRNA-mediated inactivation of GSK-3. Knockdown of GSK-3β alone was as effective in attenuating the phosphorylation as the combined knock-down of both isoforms, indicating that GSK-3β could be the more important isoform in the phosphorylation of Thr426 and Ser430. The depletion of GSK-3α and β in these experiments was not complete, because the complete removal of GSK-3 affected cell viability, making it difficult to interpret the results. Taken together, our results suggest that GSK-3β is involved in the phosphorylation of both Thr426 and Ser430 in response to DNA binding. In support of this hypothesis, we found that endogenous GSK-3β in HeLa cells was recruited to SREBP-binding sites in DNAP assays (Fig. 3C). Importantly, less GSK-3β was recruited to DNA when cells had been treated with excess sterols to lower the levels of mature SREBP1. To determine whether the recruitment of GSK-3β to SREBP-regulated promoters is dependent on a functional SREBP-binding site in the promoter, we performed DNAP assays with HeLa nuclear extracts and the proximal promoter from the LDLr gene, either wild type or a mutant in which the SREBP-binding site has been deleted. As illustrated in Fig. 3D, endogenous GSK-3β was recruited to the wild type promoter and not to the promoter lacking a functional SREBP-binding site. Taken together with our previous results, these results establish that GSK-3β is recruited to SREBP1-regulated promoters by direct interactions with SREBP1. To address the question of how DNA binding promotes GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of SREBP1, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays with recombinant SREBP1a, either wild type or a mutant lacking the C-terminal domain (ΔC), and in vitro translated GSK-3β in the absence or presence of DNA. Wild type SREBP1a and the ΔC mutant interacted equally well with GSK-3β in the absence of DNA (Fig. 3E, first and third lanes). Interestingly, the addition of DNA dramatically enhanced the interaction between wild type SREBP1a and GSK-3β (Fig. 3E, second lane). Although the ΔC protein bound DNA with the same affinity as the wild type protein (supplemental Fig. S3 and Ref. 9Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Punga T. Ericsson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11681-11686Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), no enhanced interaction between the ΔC protein and GSK-3β was observed in response to DNA binding (Fig. 3E, fourth lane). Thus, our results demonstrate that DNA binding enhances the interaction between SREBP1 and GSK-3β in a manner dependent on the C-terminal domain in SREBP1. Using GSK-3β-specific antibodies in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we found that endogenous GSK-3β was associated with the promoters of the HMG-CoA synthase (HMGS), LDLr, and FPP synthase (FPPS) genes, which are all positively regulated by SREBP (Fig. 3F). Taken together, our results indicate that SREBP1 is hyperphosphorylated when associated with DNA and that the recruitment of GSK-3β to DNA-bound SREBP1 contributes to the phosphorylation of Thr426 and Ser430 in its phosphodegron. However, the overall phosphorylation of SREBP1 in response to DNA binding was unaffected by the inhibition of GSK-3 (Fig. 3, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting that SREBP1 is also targeted by other kinases in response to DNA binding. The identification of these kinases and the residues they modify will be important in the future. Rapid Accumulation of Phosphorylated SREBP1 on Target Promoters in Response to Proteasome Inhibition—Treating cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 stabilizes the mature form of endogenous SREBP1 by inhibiting ubiquitin-dependent degradation of SREBP1 molecules phosphorylated on Thr426 and Ser430 (8Sundqvist A. Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Ye X. Lukiyanchuk V. Jin J. Harper J.W. Ericsson J. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculated that endogenous SREBP1 phosphorylated on Thr426 and Ser430 should accumulate on the promoters of SREBP target genes in response to proteasome inhibition. To test this hypothesis, we performed ChIP assays on HeLa cells treated in the absence or presence of MG132. As expected, endogenous SREBP1 accumulated on target promoters in response to proteasome inhibition (Fig. 4A). When the ChIPs were performed with phospho-specific anti-SREBP1 antibodies, we could demonstrate that SREBP1 molecules phosphorylated on Thr426 and Ser430 are associated with target promoters in vivo. Inactivation of the proteasome resulted in a dramatic increase in the amount of phosphorylated SREBP1 associated with promoters (Fig. 4A). Quantification of the amount of [32P]CTP incorporated in the PCR products demonstrated that the relative accumulation of phosphorylated SREBP1 on target promoters in response to MG132 treatment was greater than the accumulation of total SREBP1, indicating that SREBP1 molecules phosphorylated on Thr426 and Ser430 are rapidly removed from target promoters by a proteasome-dependent process. Interestingly, the accumulation of SREBP1 on target promoters in response to MG132 treatment correlated with an enhanced expression of both endogenous SREBP target genes and SREBP-regulated promoter-reporter genes in response to inhibition of the proteasome (Fig. 4, B and C), indicating that the proteolytic activity of the proteasome is not required for the transcriptional activity of SREBP1. As indicated above, treatment of cells with MG132 leads to the accumulation of mature SREBP1 as a result of decreased degradation by the proteasome. It was therefore possible that the accumulation of SREBP1 on target promoters in response to MG132 treatment was a result of the increased cellular levels of SREBP1 rather than a specific effect on the degradation of promoter-bound SREBP1. To address this issue, we used anti-SREBP1 and anti-pT426 antibodies in ChIP assays at different time points following the addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. In parallel experiments, the accumulation of total and phosphorylated (pT426) SREBP1 was monitored in total cell lysates. The results demonstrate that SREBP1, and especially the phosphorylated form of the protein, accumulates very rapidly (within 1 h) on target promoters following inhibition of the proteasome (Fig. 4D). In contrast, the cellular levels of SREBP1, both total and phosphorylated, did not reach their peak until 3 or 4 h after the addition of MG132 (Fig. 4E). These results strongly suggest that phosphorylated SREBP1 molecules associated with target promoters is the primary target for the proteolytic activity of the proteasome and support our hypothesis that DNA binding-dependent phosphorylation of the phosphodegron in SREBP1 is linked to the rapid degradation of the transcription factor. Phosphorylation-dependent Recruitment of Fbw7 to SREBP1 in Response to DNA Binding—The interaction between Fbw7 and SREBP1 is dependent on the phosphorylation of Thr426 and Ser430 (8Sundqvist A. Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Ye X. Lukiyanchuk V. Jin J. Harper J.W. Ericsson J. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the phosphorylation of Thr426 and Ser430 is enhanced in response to DNA binding, indicating that the interaction between SREBP1 and Fbw7 could be enhanced in response to DNA binding. To test this hypothesis, recombinant SREBP1a, either wild type or the DBD–/– mutant, was incubated in the absence or presence of DNA and nuclear extracts, and the interaction between SREBP1 and Fbw7α was tested following immunoprecipitation of SREBP1. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, DNA-dependent phosphorylation of wild type SREBP1a enhanced its interaction with Fbw7α, whereas the interaction between Fbw7α and the DBD–/– mutant was unaffected. We have previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of Thr426 and Ser430 in SREBP1 is critical for Fbw7-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of the transcription factor. The data presented in the current study demonstrate that the phosphorylation of both these residues is enhanced in response to DNA binding, indicating that Fbw7 could be recruited to SREBP-regulated promoters and induce the ubiquitination and degradation of SREBP. To address this issue, we performed DNAP assays, using extracts from 293 cells expressing mature SREBP1a, either wild type or the phosphorylation-deficient T426A/S430A mutant, and Fbw7α. The ubiquitin ligase was recruited to DNA by wild type SREBP1a, whereas the T426A/S430A mutant was unable to recruit any Fbw7α above background (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that Fbw7 can interact with DNA-bound SREBP1 and that this interaction is dependent on the phosphodegron in SREBP1. Based on these observations, we wanted to use ChIP assays to determine whether Fbw7 was associated with SREBP target promoters in vivo. Because antibodies that recognize endogenous Fbw7 are not available, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged Fbw7α in the presence of dominant-negative cullin 1 to attenuate Fbw7-dependent degradation of SREBP (8Sundqvist A. Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Ye X. Lukiyanchuk V. Jin J. Harper J.W. Ericsson J. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). When anti-FLAG antibodies were used in the ChIP assays, we found that transfected Fbw7α was associated with the HMGS, LDLr, and FPPS promoters (Fig. 5C), indicating that Fbw7 can associate with SREBP1 on target promoters in vivo. Interestingly, the amount of Fbw7 associated with SREBP target promoters was enhanced in response to MG132 treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that phosphorylation of SREBP1 in response to DNA binding leads to the recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase Fbw7 to SREBP target genes in vivo. Fbw7-dependent Ubiquitination of SREBP1 in Response to DNA Binding—Fbw7 is a member of the F-box family of ubiquitin ligases that target substrate proteins for ubiquitination as part of specific SCF complexes (29Jin J. Cardozo T. Lovering R.C. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 30Minella A.C. Clurman B.E. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1356-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We used in vitro ubiquitination assays to test whether Fbw7 could ubiquitinate SREBP1 in response to DNA binding. Wild type SREBP1a was ubiquitinated in an Fbw7-dependent manner in response to the addition of DNA containing SREBP-binding sites (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the phosphorylation-deficient T426A/S430A mutant was not ubiquitinated in response to DNA binding (Fig. 6B), suggesting that Fbw7 targets DNA-bound SREBP1 for ubiquitination in a manner dependent on the phosphorylation of the phosphodegron in SREBP1 in response to DNA binding. The Fbw7-dependent ubiquitination of wild type SREBP1a in response to DNA binding was attenuated in the presence of LiCl (Fig. 6C), suggesting that GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of SREBP1 is critical for its ubiquitination in response to DNA binding. When the membrane was reprobed with antibodies directed against phosphorylated SREBP1 (pT426), it became clear that SREBP1 molecules phosphorylated in response to DNA binding were highly ubiquitinated (Fig. 6C, lower panel). Thus, our results indicate that SREBP molecules that are unable to bind DNA, such as the DBD–/– mutant, would be poor substrates for Fbw7-mediated degradation in vivo. To test this hypothesis, 293T cells were transfected with mature SREBP1a, either wild type or the DBD–/– mutant, in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of Fbw7α. In support of our hypothesis, the DBD–/– protein was less sensitive to Fbw7α-mediated degradation compared with the wild type protein (Fig. 6D). This result is in agreement with the fact that the DBD–/– protein accumulates to very high levels when expressed in cells (20Sundqvist A. Ericsson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13833-13838Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Numerous reports have demonstrated a close connection between the activity and ubiquitination of transcription factors. Our current findings provide a mechanistic link between the DNA binding activity of SREBPs and their phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and degradation (Fig. 7). We have previously demonstrated that transcriptionally active SREBP molecules are rapidly degraded, whereas inactive proteins, including the DBD–/– mutant, are stable (20Sundqvist A. Ericsson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13833-13838Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that SREBP1a is phosphorylated on multiple residues in response to DNA binding, and we have identified two of the phosphorylated residues. These residues, Thr426 and Ser430, reside in the Fbw7-dependent phosphodegron in SREBP1a, and our data indicate that GSK-3β could be involved in the DNA binding-dependent phosphorylation of both residues. DNA binding promoted the interaction between the C-terminal domain of SREBP1 and GSK-3β. One possibility is that DNA binding induces a conformational change within the C-terminal domain of SREBP1 that enhances its interaction with GSK-3β. The latter hypothesis is in agreement with our observation that there is a delay between DNA binding and the phosphorylation of Thr426 and Ser430. However, it is also possible that phosphorylation of other residues in the C-terminal domain of SREBP1 in response to DNA binding could contribute to the recruitment of GSK-3β and thereby affect the phosphorylation of Thr426 and Ser430. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that SREBP1a is hyperphosphorylated in response to DNA binding and by our observation that the overall phosphorylation of SREBP1a precedes the phosphorylation of Thr426 and Ser430. Alternatively, phosphorylation of other residues than Thr426 and Ser430 could promote potential structural alterations in the C-terminal domain. It will therefore be important to identify other residues in SREBP1 that are phosphorylated in response to DNA binding. Our data indicate that most of these residues are located in the C-terminal domain (amino acid residues 417–490). It will also be important to define the role of these modifications in the regulation of the transcriptional activity and degradation of SREBP1. Although our data suggest that GSK-3β is the major kinase targeting Thr426 and Ser430 in response to DNA binding, inhibition of GSK-3 activity did not affect the overall phosphorylation of SREBP1 in response to DNA. It will therefore be important to identify other kinases involved in the hyperphosphorylation of SREBP1 in response to DNA binding. As a result of the GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of Thr426 and Ser430 in response to DNA binding, the ubiquitin ligase Fbw7 is recruited to SREBP1 when it is associated with its target promoters (Fig. 7). Thus, SREBP1 molecules that are, or have been, associated with target promoters should be better substrates for Fbw7-mediated degradation. This hypothesis was supported by our observation that the phosphorylation of both Thr426 and Ser430 was reduced in the DBD–/– mutant. As a result, the DBD–/– mutant was less sensitive to Fbw7-mediated degradation in vivo compared with the wild type protein. The hypothesis that promoter-associated SREBP1 molecules are rapidly degraded was further strengthened by our observation that SREBP1 phosphorylated on Thr426 rapidly accumulated on target promoters following MG132-mediated inhibition of the proteasome. The accumulation of SREBP1 on target promoters in response to proteasome inhibition preceded the overall cellular accumulation of mature SREBP1 in response to MG132 treatment, suggesting that phosphorylated SREBP1 molecules associated with promoters are the primary targets of the proteasome. The other two SREBP isoforms, SREBP1c and SREBP2, are also targeted by Fbw7-mediated degradation in manner dependent on amino acid residues corresponding to Thr426 and Ser430 in SREBP1a. In addition, both SREBP1c and SREBP2 are hyperphosphorylated in response to DNA binding. Thus, it is possible that the proteolytic pathway described in the current study applies to the entire SREBP family of transcription factors. Such a mechanism to regulate the stability of transcription factors ensures that the activation of target genes is linked to the absolute levels of the transcription factor and that the intracellular levels of these proteins are maintained at a low level, thereby allowing cells to respond rapidly to environmental signals. Thus, sterol-regulated cleavage and activation of the precursor forms of SREBPs (5Goldstein J.L. Debose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar) and DNA binding-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of the active transcription factor enable cells to respond rapidly to changes in cholesterol levels and control the duration of SREBP-dependent gene expression (Fig. 7). Consequently, sustained activation of SREBP target genes would require a continuous supply of mature SREBP molecules through sterol-regulated processing of precursor molecules. Taken together with our previous work (8Sundqvist A. Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Ye X. Lukiyanchuk V. Jin J. Harper J.W. Ericsson J. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), the current study suggests that the phosphorylation and Fbw7-dependent degradation of active SREBP molecules plays an important role in SREBP-regulated transcription. The activity of GSK-3 is controlled by extracellular signals, including insulin signaling. Thus, the DNA binding-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of active SREBP molecules could be regulated by growth factor signaling. It has been suggested that the activities of certain transcription factors, including c-Myc and Gcn4, are enhanced by ubiquitination and/or proteasome-mediated degradation (23Kim S.Y. Herbst A.

Nature. 2005; 438: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, the expression of SREBP target genes is enhanced in cells lacking Fbw7 (8Sundqvist A. Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Ye X. Lukiyanchuk V. Jin J. Harper J.W. Ericsson J. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and in response to inactivation of the proteasome (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, it appears as if Fbw7-mediated ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation are not required for the transcriptional activity of SREBPs. Rather, ubiquitin-dependent degradation of SREBPs appears to be required to remove promoter-bound transcription factors to allow binding of new molecules in a process that could be termed “destruction by activation” (15Lipford J.R. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, more detailed studies of the potential role of mono- and polyubiquitination of SREBPs for their activity are warranted. SREBP molecules cannot be degraded as soon as they associate with target promoters. Their degradation must be delayed until transcription has been initiated. It is possible that these processes are controlled by the phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of other residues in SREBP1. It will therefore be important to identify all the residues in SREBP1 that are phosphorylated in response to DNA binding. The identification of other post-translational modifications associated with promoter-bound SREBP1, as well as detailed structural studies of SREBP1 bound to DNA, will also be helpful to determine how DNA binding enhances the phosphorylation of SREBP1.

This study investigated regulation of CCN2 gene expression by Ets family of transcription factors, focusing on two members, Fli1 and Ets1, with deregulated expression during fibrosis and tumorigenesis. We show that Ets1 and Fli1 have opposite effects on CCN2 gene expression. Ets1 functions as an activator of CCN2 transcription, whereas Fli1 acts as a repressor. A functional Ets binding site was mapped at –114 within the CCN2 promoter. This site not only mediates stimulation by Ets factors, including Ets1, Ets2, and GABPα/β, but is also required for the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β response. The contrasting functions of Ets1 and Fli1 in regulation of the CCN2 gene were confirmed by suppressing their endogenous levels using adenoviral vectors expressing specific small interfering RNAs. Additional experiments using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have revealed that in fibroblasts both Ets1 and Fli1 occupy the CCN2 promoter. TGF-β stimulation resulted in displacement of Fli1 from the CCN2 promoter and a transient inhibition of Fli1 synthesis. Moreover, reduction of Fli1 expression resulted in up-regulation of COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes and down-regulation of the MMP1 gene. Thus, inhibition of Fli1 recapitulated some of the key effects of TGF-β, suggesting that Fli1 suppression is involved in activation of the profibrotic gene program in fibroblasts. On the other hand, activation of the CCN2 gene downstream of Ets1 is consistent with its role in angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling. This study strongly supports a critical role of Fli1 and Ets1 in the pathological extracellular matrix regulation during fibrosis and cancer.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6464-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Activation of Ets1 occurs in response to Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling through phosphorylation on the Thr38 within the N-terminal PNT (pointed) domain (6Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Additional studies have shown that phospho-Thr38 augments interaction of Ets1 with the transcription coactivator CREB-binding protein/p300 (7Foulds C.E. Nelson M.L. Blaszczak A.G. Graves B.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10954-10964Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ca2+-dependent signaling inhibits DNA binding activity of Ets1 through phosphorylation of serine residues within the autoinhibitory module located in the C-terminal domain (8Pufall M.A. Lee G.M. Nelson M.L. Kang H.S. Velyvis A. Kay L.E. McIntosh L.P. Graves B.J. Science. 2005; 309: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Ets1 is also modulated by acetylation in response to TGF-β signaling (9Czuwara-Ladykowska J. Sementchenko V.I. Watson D.K. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20399-20408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Interestingly, increased Ets1 acetylation correlated with the dissociation of Ets1 from p300 (9Czuwara-Ladykowska J. Sementchenko V.I. Watson D.K. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20399-20408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have also demonstrated that Ets1 is modified by sumoylation that involves Lys15 within the N-terminal segment of Ets1 (10Macauley M.S. Errington W.J. Scharpf M.

In contrast to Ets1 phosphorylation, the functional significance of other post-translational modifications are not known. Fli1 is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cell lineages. It plays an important role in megakaryocytic differentiation, and it has also been implicated in myelomonocytic, erythroid, and NK cell development (11Masuya M. Moussa O. Abe T. Deguchi T. Higuchi T. Ebihara Y. Spyropoulos D.D. Watson D.K. Ogawa M. Blood. 2005; 105: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Spyropoulos D.D. Pharr P.N. Lavenburg K.R. Jackers P. Papas T.S. Ogawa M. Watson D.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5643-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Fli1 is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells, but its target genes and its role in the vasculature have not been fully characterized (13Hart A. Melet F. Grossfeld P. Chien K. Jones C. Tunnacliffe A. Favier R. Bernstein A. Immunity. 2000; 13: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies have shown that Fli1 is expressed in dermal fibroblasts, where it may play a role in ECM gene regulation (14Czuwara-Ladykowska J. Shirasaki F. Jackers P. Watson D.K. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20839-20848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 15Shirasaki F. Makhluf H.A. LeRoy C. Watson D.K. Trojanowska M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7755-7764Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to hematopoietic cells, in which the role of Fli1 is well established, relatively little is known about Fli1 function in other cell types. CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor) is a member of the CCN family of the multifunctional matricellular factors, which regulate angiogenesis, chondrogenesis, and wound healing (16Brigstock D.R. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 178: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 17Rachfal A.W. Brigstock D.R. Vitam. Horm. 2005; 70: 69-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). CCN2 is expressed at low levels in the adult tissues, and its overexpression is linked to several pathological disorders, such as organ fibrosis and tumorigenesis (16Brigstock D.R. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 178: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 17Rachfal A.W. Brigstock D.R. Vitam. Horm. 2005; 70: 69-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Early studies by Grotendorst (18Grotendorst G.R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) have shown that CCN2 is induced by TGF-β and that it contributes to the regulation of the profibrotic gene program in fibroblasts. CCN2 is also up-regulated by other fibrogenic cytokines, including angiotensin II, endothelin 1, and thrombin, further supporting its role in organ fibrosis (19Chambers R.C. Leoni P. Blanc-Brude O.P.

There is increasing evidence that CCN2 plays a positive role in tumorigenesis, where it may contribute to formation of reactive stroma by promoting excessive matrix remodeling and tumor angiogenesis (22Planque N. Perbal B. Cancer Cell Int. 2003; 3: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Proangiogenic factors, such as hypoxia, vascular endothelial growth factor, and S1P, are among the known inducers of CCN2 (23Kondo S. Kubota S. Shimo T. Nishida T. Yosimichi G. Eguchi T. Sugahara T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40725-40731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Recent studies have begun to characterize signaling pathways involved in regulation of the CCN2 gene in response to various stimuli. It was shown that stimulation of CCN2 gene expression by TGF-β required activation of both Smad and ERK signaling pathways (26Leivonen S.K. Hakkinen L. Liu D. Kahari V.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2005; 124: 1162-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Additional pathways implicated in CCN2 gene regulation include small GTPase Rho and protein kinase C (27Graness A. Giehl K. Goppelt-Struebe M. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28He Z. Way K.J. Arikawa E. Chou E. Opland D.M. Clermont A. Isshiki K. Ma R.C. Scott J.A. Schoen F.J. Feener E.P. King G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15719-15726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Whereas the regulation of CCN2 occurs primarily at the level of transcription, with the exception of TGF-β/Smad3 signaling, little is known about the nature of the transcription factors mediating regulation of the CCN2 gene in response to various stimuli. Fli1 and Ets1 have been previously associated with regulation of ECM genes, including collagen type I and tenascin-C (14Czuwara-Ladykowska J. Shirasaki F. Jackers P. Watson D.K. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20839-20848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 15Shirasaki F. Makhluf H.A. LeRoy C. Watson D.K. Trojanowska M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7755-7764Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Importantly, reduction of Fli1 expression correlated with elevated collagen synthesis in patients with scleroderma, a systemic fibrotic disease, suggesting that absence of Fli1 may directly contribute to the process of fibrosis (29Kubo M. Czuwara-Ladykowska J. Moussa O. Markiewicz M. Smith E. Silver R.M. Jablonska S. Blaszczyk M. Watson D.K. Trojanowska M. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 571-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). On the other hand, elevated expression of Ets1 is often present in stromal fibroblasts and endothelial cells in various tumors (5Trojanowska M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6464-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Given the fact that CCN2 overexpression frequently occurs under pathologic conditions that are also characterized by the aberrant expression of Fli1 and Ets1, this study was designed to determine whether Ets1 and Fli1 are involved in regulation of the CCN2 gene in fibroblasts and endothelial cells. We found that Ets1 and Fli1 play contrasting roles in CCN2 gene regulation, with Ets1 being a positive regulator and Fli1 a negative regulator of this gene. Cells—Human fibroblast cultures were established from the foreskins of newborns. Briefly, the tissue was minced and digested overnight at 37 °C with collagenase (0.25%) and DNase I (0.05%) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and then plated. After establishing the culture, regular maintenance and propagation was carried out in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% serum. All experiments were carried out in early passage cells. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMVECs) were isolated from human foreskins using the protocol of Richard et al. (30Richard L. Velasco P. Detmar M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, primary cultures of human foreskins were established after the removal of epidermis. Such cultures consist of a mixture of HDMVECs, dermal fibroblasts, and some keratinocytes. Subconfluent cultures were treated with tumor necrosis factor-α for 6 h to selectively induce the expression of E-selectin in HDMVECs. HDMVECs were then purified using magnetic beads coupled to an anti-E-selectin monoclonal antibody. First passage cultures usually consist of >99% HDMVECs. A second immunomagnetic purification step ensures homogenous population of HDMVECs suitable for long term culturing. Purity of the HDMVEC cultures was evaluated using anti-CD31 and anti-von Willebrand factor antibodies. Plasmids, Transient Transfections, and Luciferase Assay—Connective tissue growth factor promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in pGL2 vector (CCN2-Luc) was a gift from Dr. Gary Grotendorst (University of Miami). Site-specific mutations of the connective tissue growth factor promoter were generated using the Exsite site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the primers given in Table 1. pSG5Ets1, pSG5Fli1, pSG5Ets2, pSG5Ets2 dominant negative mutant, and pSG5GABPα and pSG5GABPβ expression plasmids were described earlier (15Shirasaki F. Makhluf H.A. LeRoy C. Watson D.K. Trojanowska M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7755-7764Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Primers for CCN2 EBS mutantsMutantPrimers (5′-3′)EBS-1GCGATTAATGTCCCTGTTTGTGTA (forward)ATTCCTCCCCACCTTCCTGCCTCA (reverse)EBS-2GGGGATTAATGCGAGGAATGTCCC (forward)ACCTTCCTGCCTCATCAACTCACA (reverse)EBS-3GGCATTAAGGTGGGGAGGAATGCG (forward)TCATCAACTCACACGCGATTGATC (reverse)EBS-4CGGATTAATGCTGAGTGTCAAGGG (forward)TCTGAAAAAGCTGGCACACTCCAG (reverse) Open table in a new tab Transient transfections were performed in foreskin fibroblasts seeded into 12-well plates using Fugene6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After overnight incubation, some cells were treated with 2.5 ng/ml TGF-β and then further incubated for 24 h. The cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase reporter activity using the Promega luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Co-transfection with pSV-β-galactosidase control vector was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. β-Galactosidase was measured using Galacto-Light-Plus (Tropix). Adenoviral siRNA Vectors—The following siRNA target sequences were used: for Ets1, CAGACACCTTGCAGAATGA; for Fli1, GTTCACTGCTGGCCTATAA. Annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides were cloned into MluI and XhoI sites of pRNAT-H1.1 shuttle vector (Genescript). The shuttle vector with target siRNA sequence was linearized with PmeI and then electroporated into BJ5183-AD-1 (Stratagene) to generate recombinant Adenoeasy vector. The recombinant Adenoeasy plasmid after linearization with PacI enzyme was transfected into QBI-293 cells using Transfectin (Bio-Rad) for generation of adenovirus. The shuttle vector plasmid and Adenoeasy vector plasmid were sequenced to confirm the cloning. The primary adenoviral stock was then amplified and concentrated by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. Typical viral titer was 1 × 1010 plaque-forming units/ml. Control adenovirus vector was prepared in the same manner. In addition, an oligonucleotide targeted to 5′-GGAGCCGCCATCACAATAC-3′ sequence of the Fli1 gene was also cloned into pRNAT H1.1, as described above, to validate the effect of Fli1 suppression on the CCN2 gene. The plasmid was electroporated into foreskin fibroblasts by Amaxa kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. To validate the effect of Ets1 suppression on the CCN2 gene, the following protocol was used: a 330-bp region (positions 1830–2160) specific for the Ets1 (NM_005238.2) gene cloned into the pLitmus 38i vector (New England Biolabs) was provided by Dr. Tien Hsu (Medical University of South Carolina). The Ets1-specific region was transcribed in vitro using T7 Ribomax Express RNA interference system (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was then digested with dicer enzyme (New England Biolabs) to generate a pool of siRNAs. siRNAs were transfected into foreskin fibroblasts using RNAifect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA Isolation, Quantitatative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the fibroblasts using Tri reagent (MRC Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed in a 20-μl reaction volume using random primers and the Transcriptor first strand synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science) and then diluted to 40 μl. Real time quantitative PCR was carried out using IQ Sybr green mix (Bio-Rad) on an Icycler machine (Bio-Rad) using 1 μl of the cDNA in triplicates with β-actin as the internal control. The primers used for the various genes are listed in Table 2 and have been validated to β-actin. The -fold change in the levels of genes of interest was determined by 2–ΔΔCt. PCR conditions were 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, and 58 °C for 1 min. To check for the absence of secondary products, a melt curve analysis for the PCR product was carried out.TABLE 2Primers for quantitative PCRGenePrimers (5′-3′)CCN2TTGCGAAGCTGACCTGGAAGAGAA (forward)AGCTCGGTATGTCTTCATGCTGGT (reverse)Fli1GGATGGCAAGGAACTGTGTAA (forward)GGTTGTATAGGCCAGCAG (reverse)Ets1AGAGCTCCTCTCCCTCAAGTTATG (forward)GGGTGACGACTTCTTGTTTGATA (reverse)β-ActinAATGTCGCGGAGGACTTTGATTGC (forward)AGGATGGCAAGGGACTTCCTGTAA (reverse)Collagen I A(1)CCAGAAGAACTGGTACATCAGCA (forward)CGCCATACTCGAACTGGGAAT (reverse)Collagen I A(2)GATGTTGAACTTGTTGCTGAGG (forward)TCTTTCCCCATTCATTTGTCTT (reverse)MMP1aObtained from PRIMER BANK (available on the World Wide Web at pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/), identification number 4505215A1.TCTGGGGTGTGGTGTCTA (forward)GCCTCCCATCATTCTCAGGTT (reverse)a Obtained from PRIMER BANK (available on the World Wide Web at pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/), identification number 4505215A1. Open table in a new tab Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cell lysates were prepared after appropriate treatment in radioimmune precipitation buffer. For immunoprecipitation of Ets1, 2 μgof Ets1 monoclonal antibody (NCL) was added to 300 μg of precleared cell lysate, and complex formation was carried out at 4 °C overnight. The protein-antibody complexes were recovered using protein G-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times in radioimmune precipitation buffer, eluted by boiling for 5 min in 2× SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blot with anti-Ets1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). For straight Western blotting, 15–25 μg of protein was size-fractionated on SDS-PAGE and then transferred on nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tween/Tris-buffered saline. The membranes were then probed with, anti-Fli antibody (BD Biosciences), anti-collagen antibody (Southern Biotechnologies), or anti-MMP1 antibody (Chemicon) overnight at 4 °C. For CCN2 Western blot, the membranes were blocked in 2% gelatin and probed with anti-CCN2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at room temperature. The blots were then incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxide-coupled secondary antibodies and developed using the Chemiluminescent kit (Pierce). The blots were stripped and reprobed for β-actin (Sigma). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP was carried out according to the protocol of Boyd and Farnham (31Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with modifications. Cells either untreated or treated with TGF-β for 4 h were cross-linked by adding formaldehyde directly to cell culture medium to a final concentration of 1% and incubating for 10 min at 37 °C. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. The cells were washed with cold PBS containing protease inhibitors and then scraped. Cells were recovered by centrifugation and were suspended in cell lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors and incubated on ice for 20 min. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm, resuspended in sonication buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) containing protease inhibitor mixture, and incubated on ice for 10 min. Chromatin was sheared by sonication to yield an average fragment size of 500 bp and then microcentrifuged at 14,000 rpm, and supernatant containing soluble chromatin was collected. The chromatin was either stored at –70 °C or processed for immunoprecipitation. The chromatin solution was precleared with protein G-Sepharose (blocked with sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 5% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 4 °C. Precleared chromatin from 2 × 107 cells was incubated with 10 μg of Ets1 (sc-350X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Fli1 antibody (developed at the Medical University of South Carolina antibody facility) and rotated at 4 °C overnight. Recovery of immunoprecipitated chromatin was done using protein G-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C under rotation. The chromatin-antibody-protein G-Sepharose complexes were recovered by centrifugation. The beads were washed for 5 min at room temperature sequentially with the following buffers: low salt wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS), high salt wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS), lithium chloride wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA), buffer D (buffer C with 500 mm LiCl). The beads were then washed twice in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA). Immunocomplexes were eluted off of the beads in two rounds of 100 μl of 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, and the cross-links were reversed by incubation for 4 h at 65 °C after the addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 0.2 m. Proteins were digested with proteinase K (40 μg/ml) for 1 h at 50 °C. DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Of the total yield of 30 μlof DNA, 2 μl was used in each PCR. Relative -fold enrichment of the DNA was determined either by regular PCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis or by quantitative PCR. A 213-base pair region (–194 to +19) of the CCN2 promoter encompassing the putative EBSs was amplified using the following primers (5′–3′): forward, ggagtgtgccagctttttc; reverse, ggaagattgtgttgtgtgag. For regular PCR, 2 μl of enriched DNA and 1 μl of input DNA was used as the template in a reaction volume of 25 μl containing 2 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm dNTPs, 400 nm primers, and 0.25 units of Gold Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems). The conditions for PCR were 95 °C for 6 min, 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 26 cycles. Quantification was carried out as described by Chakrabarti et al. (32Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the Ct value of the input DNA was subtracted from the Ct value of immunoprecipitated DNA (ΔCt). Then Ct values obtained from the control primer set (active motif) were subtracted from the ΔCt value to get the ΔΔCt value. -Fold differences (Ets-1/Fli-1 ChIP relative to no antibody ChIP) were then determined by raising 1.9 to the –ΔΔCt power. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test analysis using GraphPad InStat statistics software (version 1.12) was performed to determine statistical significance. Values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Ets Factors Modulate CCN2 Gene Expression—To investigate the potential role of Ets factors in CCN2 gene regulation, we utilized the CCN2 promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene (CCN2-Luc) (33Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar). Human foreskin fibroblasts were co-transfected with CCN2-Luc and a dominant negative mutant of Ets2 (DNM-Ets2). This mutant consists of a DNA binding domain of Ets2 but lacks the transactivation domain and is effective in blocking interactions of Ets factors with the Ets binding sites (34Delannoy-Courdent A. Mattot V. Fafeur V. Fauquette W. Pollet I. Calmels T. Vercamer C. Boilly B. Vandenbunder B. Desbiens X. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNM-Ets2 inhibited basal promoter activity by 50% and completely abolished TGF-β stimulation of the CCN2 promoter, thus linking Ets factors to regulation of the CCN2 gene (Fig. 1, A and B). To begin examination of the involvement of specific Ets factors, CCN2-Luc was co-transfected with Ets1, Ets2, GABPα/β, or Fli1. Each of these factors had differential effect on the basal and TGF-β-stimulated promoter activity. Ets1 or GABPα/β and, to a lesser extent, Ets2 showed stimulation of the CCN2 promoter, whereas Fli1 inhibited basal promoter activity by ∼30% (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, Ets1, Ets2, and GABPα/β cooperated with TGF-β in stimulation of the CCN2 promoter, whereas Fli1 partially inhibited TGF-β stimulation (Fig. 1B). This initial experiment has suggested that various Ets family members may play distinct roles in CCN2 gene regulation in human fibroblasts. Mapping of the EBSs in the CCN2 Promoter—Previous studies have characterized several response elements in the proximal region of the CCN2 promoter, including TβRE, Smad3, and Sp1 binding sites (35Blom I.E. Goldschmeding R. Leask A. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Inspection of the –200 to +13 promoter region revealed the presence of the four putative Ets binding sites, which were termed EBS-1 to -4 (Fig. 2A). These GGAA motifs were mutated individually, and their contribution to the basal CCN2 promoter activity was determined. Mutation of EBS-2 had a dramatic effect on the basal promoter activity (90% reduction), whereas mutations in either EBS-1 or EBS-3 decreased promoter activity by ∼50%. EBS-4 mutation did not consistently affect the basal promoter activity (Fig. 2B). These data further confirm that Ets factors contribute to regulation of the CCN2 gene. Ets Factors Stimulate the CCN2 Promoter via EBS-3—We next determined which of the EBSs mediated TGF-β and Ets1 stimulation of the CCN2 promoter. We also assessed whether mutations of EBSs affected cooperation of Ets1 with the TGF-β signaling pathway. As shown in Fig. 3A, mutating EBS-3 had the most pronounced effect on the promoter activation. Stimulatory effects of either TGF-β or Ets1 as well as cooperative stimulatory effect of TGF-β and Ets1 were completely abrogated by this mutation. Mutation in EBS-4, a site adjacent to the Smad binding site, also completely inhibited TGF-β stimulation but had no effect on Ets1 stimulation of the CCN2 promoter. However, cooperative effect of Ets1 and TGF-β was greatly diminished by this mu"

No fast pulsations are visible. If genetically tied to the supernova remnant, the source could either be an x-ray binary, composed of a compact object and a low-mass star in an eccentric orbit, or an isolated neutron star. In the latter case, the combination of its age and period would indicate that it is a peculiar magnetar, dramatically slowed down, possibly by a supernova debris disc. Both scenarios require nonstandard assumptions about the formation and evolution of compact objects in supernova explosions."
https://openalex.org/W2138552539,"Activity of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is limiting for Na+ absorption across many epithelia. Consequently, ENaC is a central effector impacting systemic blood volume and pressure. Two members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, K-Ras and RhoA, activate ENaC. K-Ras activates ENaC via a signaling pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate with the phospholipid directly interacting with the channel to increase open probability. How RhoA increases ENaC activity is less clear. Here we report that RhoA and K-Ras activate ENaC through independent signaling pathways and final mechanisms of action. Activation of RhoA signaling rapidly increases the membrane levels of ENaC likely by promoting channel insertion. This process dramatically increases functional ENaC current, resulting in tight spatial-temporal control of these channels. RhoA signals to ENaC via a transduction pathway, including the downstream effectors Rho kinase and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate produced by activated phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase may play a role in targeting vesicles containing ENaC to the plasma membrane. Activity of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is limiting for Na+ absorption across many epithelia. Consequently, ENaC is a central effector impacting systemic blood volume and pressure.

K-Ras activates ENaC via a signaling pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate with the phospholipid directly interacting with the channel to increase open probability. How RhoA increases ENaC activity is less clear. Here we report that RhoA and K-Ras activate ENaC through independent signaling pathways and final mechanisms of action. Activation of RhoA signaling rapidly increases the membrane levels of ENaC likely by promoting channel insertion. This process dramatically increases functional ENaC current, resulting in tight spatial-temporal control of these channels. RhoA signals to ENaC via a transduction pathway, including the downstream effectors Rho kinase and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate produced by activated phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase may play a role in targeting vesicles containing ENaC to the plasma membrane. Small G proteins act as GTP-dependent switches to control the activity of effector proteins and thus initiate cellular signaling cascades. A wide variety of ion channels and intracellular processes respond to signaling from small G proteins in the Ras superfamily (1Downward J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2527) Google Scholar, 2Colicelli J. Sci. STKE 2004. 2004; : RE13Google Scholar). Although distinct small G proteins can target a common effector, their actions on this common effector often vary. For example, RhoA and Rac1 have opposing actions on ether a-go-go related gene (ERG) K+ channels, with the former rapidly activating the channel and the latter quickly decreasing channel activity (3Storey N.M. O'Bryan J.P. Armstrong D.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 27-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). RhoA but not closely related Rac1 and Cdc42 modulate Ica in ventricular myocytes (4Yatani A. Irie K. Otani T. Abdellatif M. Wei L. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H650-H659Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). H-Ras and Rap1 function as counteracting regulators of voltage-gated sodium current and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor-mediated synaptic transmission (5Imamura Y. Matsumoto N. Kondo S. Kitayama H.

Neuroscience. 2004; 127: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Similarly, Ras and Rap have opposite actions on muscarinic K+ channels (7Yatani A. Quilliam L.A. Brown A.M. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22222-22226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We showed previously that K-Ras and RhoA increase ENaC 2The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; mENaC, mouse ENaC; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; eYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; eCFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; PI(4)P5K, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase; pF, picofarad; HA, hemagglutinin; CA, constitutively active; DN, dominant negative. activity (8Staruschenko A.

Although both of these GTPases increase ENaC activity, they do so most likely through distinct mechanisms of action and signaling pathways. The amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel is localized to the luminal plasma membrane of epithelial cells and plays an important role in maintaining Na+ homeostasis and hence blood pressure (10Alvarez de la Rosa D. Canessa C.M. Fyfe G.K. Zhang P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 573-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 11Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol.

Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 5079-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). ENaC activity is dynamically controlled by regulation of channel open probability and localization to the luminal plasma membrane. Several lines of evidence indicate that K-RasA ultimately increases ENaC single channel open probability through its first effector PI3K (9Staruschenko A. Patel P. Tong Q. Medina J.L. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37771-37778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O.M. Tong Q. Stockand J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1669: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, RhoA may increase channel activity by increasing membrane levels of ENaC (8Staruschenko A. Nichols A. Medina J.L. Camacho P. Zheleznova N.N. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49989-49994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The exact signaling pathway underlying this effect of RhoA remains to be delineated. Moreover, it is unclear whether there is signaling convergence between K-Ras and RhoA pathways with respect to control of ENaC. One important cellular action of Rho GTPases is their regulation of actin polymerization (15Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). Rho proteins also participate in regulation of cell polarity and vesicle transport (16Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3861) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that the Rho family GTPase Rac1 mediates rapid insertion of TRPC5 channels into the plasma membrane through stimulation of PI(4)P5K (17Bezzerides V.J. Ramsey I.S. Kotecha S. Greka A. Clapham D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). We test here whether RhoA has a similar mechanism of action on ENaC. We find that K-Ras and RhoA increase ENaC activity independent of each other through distinct signaling cascades and final mechanisms of action. RhoA increases ENaC activity through its downstream effectors Rho kinase and PI(4)P5K. RhoA signaling increases ENaC activity by elevating plasma membrane levels of the channel likely resulting from increased channel insertion. cDNA Constructs and Cell Culture—All chemicals and materials were purchased from either Calbiochem, Bio-Rad, Fisher, or Sigma unless noted otherwise. CHO and COS-7 cells were maintained with standard culture conditions (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium +10% fetal bovine serum, 37 °C, 5% CO2) and transfected using Polyfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described previously (18Gamper N.

Similarly, A6 epithelial cells were cultured and grown to confluence on permeable supports using standard procedures as described previously (22Booth R.E. Tong Q. Medina J. Snyder P.M. Patel P.

For TIRF microscopy experiments (see below), COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium that contained 25 mm HEPES and 10 μm amiloride to better buffer extracellular pH and to lessen sodium loading, respectively. The plasmids encoding α-, β-, and γ-mouse ENaC, as well as mENaC subunit fusion proteins having NH2-terminally linked eYFP and eCFP have been described previously (9Staruschenko A. Patel P. Tong Q.

As noted in these earlier publications, channels composed of eCFP- and eYFP-tagged subunits exhibit functional behavior indistinguishable from those lacking fluorescent tags. Plasmids encoding membrane-localized eCFP-M and eYFP-M were from Clontech. Expression vectors encoding constitutively active (G14V) and dominant negative (T19N) Myc-tagged RhoA as well as constitutively active (G12V) HA-tagged K-Ras were from the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center. The expression vector encoding membrane-targeted constitutively active PI3K (pUSE-amp-p110α) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The mammalian expression vector encoding type I PI(4)P5K α-isoform was a kind gift from Dr. L. Pott and has been described previously (26Bender K. Wellner-Kienitz M.C. Pott L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Expression vectors encoding constitutively active and dominant negative Rho kinase were a generous gift from Dr. A. D. Verin with permission from Dr. K. Kaibuchi and have been described previously (27Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Fukata Y. Yano T. Shibata M. Ikebe M. Kaibuchi K.

In brief, this hybrid contains the exoenzyme C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase domain fused to an enzyme-deficient Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin domain that recruits cell entry machinery allowing C2IN-C3 to enter the cell. Binary chimeric toxin was prepared fresh prior to each experiment by mixing 300 μl of the C2 binding component (100 μg/ml) with 100 μl of the C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase domain (300 μg/ml) and then used at a 1:50 dilution. Stocks for both components were in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Electrophysiology—Whole-cell macroscopic current recordings of mENaC expressed in CHO cells were made under voltage clamp conditions using standard methods (19Pochynyuk O. Staruschenko A. Tong Q.

In brief, current through ENaC was the inward, amiloride-sensitive Na+ current at -80 mV with a bath solution (in mm) of 160 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4) and a pipette solution (in mm) of 120 CsCl, 5 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2.0 ATP, and 0.1 GTP (pH 7.4). Where specified, cells were incubated with 1 μm Y-27632 ((+)-R-trans-4-(aminoethyl)-N-(4-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide 2HCl H2O), a Rho kinase inhibitor (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Current recordings were acquired with PC-505B (Warner Instruments) and Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments) patch clamp amplifiers interfaced via Digidata 1322A (Axon Instruments) to a PC running the pClamp 9.2 suite of software (Axon Instruments). Cells were held at a holding potential 40 mV with voltage ramps (500 ms) from 60 mV down to -100 mV used to elicit current. ENaC activity is reported as the amiloride-sensitive current density at -80 mV. Whole-cell capacitance was routinely compensated and was ∼8-10 pF for CHO cells. Series resistances, on average 2-5 megohms, were also compensated. Trans-epithelial Na+ current across A6 cell monolayers was calculated, as described previously (22Booth R.E. Tong Q. Medina J.

For these experiments, A6 cells were grown on Costar Transwell permeable supports (0.4 μm pore, 24 mm diameter) in the presence of 1.5 μm aldosterone and allowed to become confluent as determined by persistent and avid Na+ reabsorption. Western Blot Experiments—Western blot experiments were performed using standard methods (22Booth R.E. Tong Q. Medina J. Snyder P.M. Patel P. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41367-41379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Hendron E. Stockand J.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3042-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were extracted for >2 h at 4 °C in RIPA lysis buffer (10 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS (pH 7.2)) supplemented with 1 μm of the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For each lysate, protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Following normalization of total protein concentration, and addition of sample buffer (0.005% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, 3% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 77 mm Tris-HCl, and 20 mm dithiothreitol), proteins were then separated by standard SDS-PAGE (15% gels) and subsequently electroblotted to nitrocellulose (0.45-μm pore). Blots were probed with anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies from Clontech and Roche Applied Science, respectively, in the presence of 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dried milk as blocking reagents. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy—Fluorescence emissions from eYFP-tagged ENaC (each subunit tagged with eYFP) and membrane-localized eCFP-M were collected using TIRF microscopy (30Taraska J.W.

Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) to selectively illuminate the plasma membrane. This isolated fluorescence emissions from eYFP-tagged membrane ENaC. All TIRF experiments were performed in the TIRF microscopy core facility housed within the Department of Physiology at the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio. Fluorescence emissions from eYFP-tagged ENaC were collected using an inverted TE2000 microscope with through-the-lens TIRF imaging (Nikon, Japan). Samples were viewed through a plain Apo TIRF ×60 oil immersion, high resolution (1.45 N.A.) objective. The eCFP and eYFP fluorophores were excited with a 442-nm Melles Griot dual-pulsed solid state and 514-nm argon ion laser, respectively, with an acoustic optic tunable filter used to select excitation wavelengths (Prairie Technology, Middleton, WI). Emissions from eCFP and eYFP fluorophores passed through an image splitting device (Dual-View, Optical Insights, Tucson, AZ) using a 505-nm dichroic filter to split emissions, which then passed through 470 ± 15 and 550 ± 25 nm emission filters, respectively. Fluorescence images were captured with a chargecoupled device camera interfaced to a PC running Metamorph software. Statistics—All patch clamp data are presented as mean ± S.E. Data compared with either the Student's (two-tailed) t test or a one-way analysis of variance in conjunction with the Dunnett or Student Newman Keuls post-test where appropriate. p ≤ 0.05 is considered significant. RhoA and K-Ras Have Independent Effects on ENaC—We co-expressed mENaC with RhoA and K-Ras to investigate the effects of these small G proteins on the channel and to ask whether these signaling molecules were part of a converging or parallel transduction pathway with respect to activating the channel. ENaC was reconstituted by co-expressing α-, β-, and γ-mENaC subunits as described previously (19Pochynyuk O. Staruschenko A. Tong Q. Medina J. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37565-37571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O. Stockand J.D. J. Biol.

Fig. 1A shows representative macroscopic ENaC currents before (arrows) and after treatment with amiloride in CHO cells expressing the channel alone (top) and with constitutively active K-RasG12V (top middle) and RhoAG14V (bottom middle) separately and together (bottom). For these experiments, plasmids encoding the small G proteins were transfected at saturating levels (1.0 μg; see Fig. 1, D and E). As summarized in Fig. 1B, K-RasG12V and RhoAG14V significantly increase ENaC activity. Moreover, K-RasG12V and RhoAG14V, when expressed together, have additive effects on ENaC. The representative Western blots in Fig. 1C show that exogenous K-RasG12V (top) and RhoAG14V (bottom) were appropriately expressed in these cells. Fig. 1D shows summary graphs of ENaC activity in the presence of increasing quantities of co-transfected K-RasG12V (left) and RhoAG14V (right) cDNA. The effects of both small G proteins saturated at ∼1.0 μg of cDNA. Fig. 1E shows corresponding Western blots for cells transfected with increasing quantities of K-RasG12V (top) and RhoAG14V (bottom) cDNA. These results demonstrate that at saturating levels, RhoA and K-Ras have additive and likely independent actions on ENaC consistent with these small G proteins being in parallel with respect to channel regulation. Rho Kinase and PI(4)P5K Are Positioned between RhoA and ENaC—We next delineated the signaling pathway by which RhoA increases ENaC activity. Rho kinase is a 1st effector of RhoA (32Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, co-expression of constitutively active Rho kinase (Rho kinase CA) significantly increased ENaC activity. In contrast, dominant negative Rho kinase (Rho kinase DN) had little effect on basal ENaC activity. Dominant negative Rho kinase co-expressed with RhoAG14V, however, did counter activation of ENaC by this small G protein. In contrast, coexpression of dominant negative RhoAT19N with Rho kinase CA had little effect on activation of ENaC by the kinase. These results position Rho kinase downstream of RhoA in the signaling pathway from this small G protein to ENaC. Because PI(4)P5K is an effector of RhoA and Rho kinase (33Weernink P.A. Meletiadis K. Hommeltenberg S. Hinz M. Ishihara H. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7840-7849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 34Yang S.A. Carpenter C.L. Abrams C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42331-42336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we asked whether this phospholipid kinase is involved in RhoA regulation of ENaC. Fig. 2B shows that expression of PI(4)P5K with ENaC significantly increased channel activity. Co-expression of RhoAT19N and Rho kinase DN did not influence the stimulatory effect of PI(4)P5K on ENaC. These results are consistent with PI(4)P5K being downstream of RhoA and Rho kinase in a signaling pathway leading to activation of ENaC. RhoA and K-Ras Signaling Do Not Converge Prior to Activating ENaC—Results in Fig. 2 demonstrate that RhoA signals to ENaC via Rho kinase and PI(4)P5K. We demonstrated previously that K-Ras signals to ENaC via its 1st effector PI3K (9Staruschenko A. Patel P. Tong Q. Medina J.L. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37771-37778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O.M. Tong Q. Stockand J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1669: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To further test whether RhoA and K-Ras signaling converge prior to activating ENaC, we probed the effects of co-expressing these small G proteins and their downstream effectors on ENaC activity. As summarized in Fig. 3A, ENaC activity in the presence of PI3K plus Rho kinase CA was not different compared with mENaC plus K-RasG12V and RhoAG14V. However, ENaC activity in the presence of PI3K and Rho kinase CA was greater compared with mENaC expressed with either PI3K or Rho kinase CA alone (not shown in the same figure, see also Figs. 2 and 3B). Moreover, co-expression of PI3K with PI(4)P5K had an additive effect greater than expression of either phospholipid kinase alone (not shown). These results demonstrate that co-expression of downstream effectors of RhoA and K-Ras recapitulate independent activation of ENaC by these small G proteins. To further explore these two signaling pathways, we tested the effects of co-expression of PI(4)P5K with K-RasG12V and RhoAG14V. ENaC activity in the presence of PI(4)P5K with K-RasG12V was, as expected, significantly greater compared with mENaC expressed with either PI(4)P5K or K-RasG12V alone (see Figs. 1 and 2). In contrast, ENaC activity in the presence of both PI(4)P5K and its upstream regulator, RhoAG14V, was not different compared with expression of this channel with either alone (see Figs. 1 and 2) but was significantly lower compared with ENaC + K-RasG12V + PI(4)P5K. Similarly, we have previously demonstrated that PI3K and its upstream regulator, K-Ras, do not have additive effects on ENaC activity (9Staruschenko A. Patel P. Tong Q. Medina J.L. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37771-37778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, the results in Fig. 3A are also consistent with RhoA and K-Ras signaling being independent and in parallel with respect to activation of ENaC. As a final test of this idea, we asked if RhoAT19N disrupts ENaC activation by PI3K. Shown in Fig. 3B is a summary graph of ENaC activity in response to co-expression of constitutively active PI3K alone and with RhoAT19N. Dominant negative RhoAT19N had no effect on PI3K-stimulated ENaC. RhoA Signaling Rapidly Increases Membrane ENaC Levels—Because RhoA and K-Ras increase ENaC activity through distinct and independent signaling pathways, we wondered if they also had different final mechanisms of action. To test whether RhoA increases ENaC activity by influencing membrane levels of the channel rather than open probability, we directly monitored changes in membrane levels of eYFP-tagged ENaC in living cells with TIRF microscopy. For these experiments, we coexpressed eYFP-tagged mENaC (all three subunits tagged) with a membrane marker (eCFP-M) in the presence and absence of RhoAG14V. Because eYFP is genetically linked to channel subunits and only membrane fluorescence is monitored with TIRF microscopy, fluorescence emissions from eYFP-ENaC are directly proportional to the number of channels in the membrane. For these experiments, cells were pretreated for 40 min with 1 μm of the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 to block RhoA signaling to ENaC. Y-27632 is a competitive inhibitor of Rho kinase that is reversible (35Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in the levels of ENaC and the negative control eCFP-M in the membrane were monitored following washout of Y-27632 to acutely activate RhoA signaling. Fig. 4A shows representative micrographs of eYFP (top) and eCFP (bottom) fluorescence emissions from the plasma membrane of a COS-7 cell expressing eYFP-tagged ENaC and eCFP-M before (left) and after (right) acute activation of RhoA signaling upon Y-27632 washout. As summarized in Fig. 4B, the relative (compared with cells not washed of Y-27632) increase in ENaC membrane levels upon acute activation of RhoA signaling in cells expressing activated RhoA (n = 13 and 10 for washed and unwashed) was markedly greater compared with cells not expressing this small G protein (n = 7 and 9 for washed and unwashed). Relative membrane ENaC levels significantly increased 2-fold upon relief of Rho kinase inhibition in cells expressing RhoAG14V (2.0 ± 0.11 at t = 40 min). This increase is greater than the 1.2-fold increase observed in cells not expressing RhoAG14V (1.2 ± 0.10 at t = 40 min). In contrast to ENaC, acute activation of RhoA signaling had no effect on eCFP-M membrane levels in the presence and absence of RhoAG14V. Reversing the fluorophores where eCFP-ENaC was expressed with eYFP-M in the presence and absence of RhoAG14V resulted in similar findings upon relief of Rho kinase inhibition (not shown). In most cases (13 of 18) for cells expressing RhoAG14V and eYFP-tagged ENaC, it was possible to distinguish “hot spots” in the membrane where ENaC accumulated as a function of time following removal of Y-27632. Membrane eYFP emissions from such a cell before and 6, 12, and 18 min after washout are shown in Fig. 4C. These hot spots either represent defined membrane domains where vesicles containing ENaC dock and insert the channel into the membrane or represent vesicles containing ENaC approaching the membrane with intensity increasing as the vesicles near the membrane and fully occupy the field excited with TIRF microscopy. An alternative is that these hot spots represent domains where membrane ENaC accumulates prior to retrieval with RhoA signaling disrupting this retrieval. Fig. 4D shows summarized results defining the time course of increases in membrane eYFP emissions upon washout of Y-27632 for cells expressing eYFP-tagged ENaC and RhoAG14V pretreated (closed squares; n = 11) and not pretreated (open squares; n = 6) with brefeldin A for 22 h. For these experiments, Y-27632 was added, as above, 40 min prior to washout with brefeldin A included in the appropriate bath and wash solutions. Cells pretreated with brefeldin A had significantly reduced levels of ENaC in the membrane following acute activation of RhoA signaling. As observed in control experiments (not shown; n = 4), relative ENaC membrane levels in cells co-transfected with RhoAG14V but not treated or washed of Y-27632 did not change over a 30-min period following 22 h of brefeldin A treatment. Because brefeldin A is an inhibitor of protein trafficking in the endomembrane system of mammalian cells (36Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar) and counters the effects of RhoA on ENaC, these results, although not definitive, are consistent with RhoA promoting ENaC trafficking to the plasma membrane rather than retarding retrieval from this membrane. Acute Activation of RhoA Signaling Rapidly Increases ENaC Activity—To better judge the ramifications of tight spatial-temporal control of ENaC by RhoA signaling, we directly monitored changes in channel activity over time upon relief of Rho kinase inhibition. Fig. 5A shows a summary graph of ENaC activity in the absence and presence of co-expression of Rho kinase CA with and without pretreatment with Y-27632. Augmentation of ENaC activity by Rho kinase CA was sensitive to Y-27632 with current density significantly decreasing in response to inhibitor.

It is an inverting, metal ion-independent family 14 glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of the core 2 O-glycan (Galβ1-3[GlcNAcβ1-6]GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr) from its donor and acceptor substrates, UDP-GlcNAc and the core 1 O-glycan (Galβ1-3GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr), respectively. Reported here are the x-ray crystal structures of murine C2GnT-L in the absence and presence of the acceptor substrate Galβ1-3GalNAc at 2.0 and 2.7Å resolution, respectively. C2GnT-L was found to possess the GT-A fold; however, it lacks the characteristic metal ion binding DXD motif. The Galβ1-3GalNAc complex defines the determinants of acceptor substrate binding and shows that Glu-320 corresponds to the structurally conserved catalytic base found in other inverting GT-A fold glycosyltransferases. Comparison of the C2GnT-L structure with that of other GT-A fold glycosyltransferases further suggests that Arg-378 and Lys-401 serve to electrostatically stabilize the nucleoside disphosphate leaving group, a role normally played by metal ion in GT-A structures. The use of basic amino acid side chains in this way is strikingly similar to that seen in a number of metal ion-independent GT-B fold glycosyltransferases and suggests a convergence of catalytic mechanism shared by both GT-A and GT-B fold glycosyltransferases.

C2GnT-L is also of considerable interest in the study of tumor metastasis given that its expression is highly correlated with tumor progression in a number of cancers. It is overexpressed in colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer, and recent work has shown that transfection of C2GnT-L into a prostate cancer cell line leads to increased tumor size in an experimental tumor model (6Shimodaira K.

The three enzymes differ in tissue distribution, and the mammalian homologues show 40-50% sequence similarity with each other. Divalent metal ions, which have been shown to be essential for catalytic activity in many glycosyltransferases, are not required by these enzymes as catalytic activity is retained in all cases in the presence of EDTA (1Williams D.

Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), only two major fold types, termed the GT-A and GT-B folds, have been observed (13Bourne Y. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The GT-A fold (SCOP fold: nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases) can be described as a single domain α/β/α structure in which the mixed β-sheet typically consists of seven β-strands of topology 3, 2, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7 (strand 6 is anti-parallel). All of the metal ion-dependent glycosyltransferases for which structures have been determined have been of this type, and all have utilized nucleoside diphosphate sugars as donor substrates. In these structures Mn2+ or Mg2+ ions are coordinated by one oxygen atom of each of the two phosphate groups of the nucleoside diphosphate sugar donor. In addition, the metal ion is also coordinated by one or two of the side chain carboxyl groups of the “DXD” motif (13Bourne Y. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This degenerate sequence motif is critical for metal ion binding, and catalysis and has been thought to be a characteristic of the GT-A fold enzymes. The GT-B fold (SCOP fold: UDP-glycosyltransferase/glycogen phosphorylase) is characterized by two distinct α/β/α domains, both of which contain all parallel β-sheets. The catalytic site is located in a cleft between the two domains, and none of the donor substrate complexes determined show evidence of bound metal ions. The recently determined structure of Campylobacter jejuni sialyltransferase CstII (14Chiu C.P. Watts A.G. Lairson L.L. Gilbert M. Lim D. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) represents the first example of a metal ion-independent glycosyltransferase not belonging to the GT-B fold. It is a single domain α/β/α structure and, as such, was first described as being a variant of the GT-A fold (14Chiu C.P. Watts A.G. Lairson L.L. Gilbert M. Lim D. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Analysis of the arrangement of its secondary structural elements and topology, however, shows that CstII represents a novel fold, and it has now been assigned to a fold of its own (SCOP fold: alpha-2,3/8-sialyltransferase CstII) (15Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5568) Google Scholar). A DALI search using CstII did not return other GT-A or GT-B fold glycosyltransferases, and to date, it is the only glycosyltransferase not represented by one of these two fold types.Inverting glycosyltransferases employ an SN2 reaction mechanism where nucleophilic attack by the acceptor hydroxyl group leads naturally to an inversion of stereochemistry at the anomeric center of the donor substrate (16Lairson L.L. Withers S.G. Chem. Commun. (Camb). 2004; : 2243-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The mechanistic basis for the retention of configuration shown by retaining glycosyltransferases, however, is less clear. Although a double displacement mechanism similar to that observed in retaining glycosidases may be possible (17Lairson L.L. Chiu C.P. Ly H.D. He S. Wakarchuk W.W. Strynadka N.C. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28339-28344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), a front side SNi mechanism has now been proposed for a number of retaining glycosyltransferases (18Persson K.

In any case, mechanisms for activating the nucleophile and stabilizing the leaving group are thought to be general features of glycosyltranferase-mediated catalysis. The use of a catalytic base (e.g. an Asp or a Glu) and a bound metal ion, respectively, provide well characterized examples of how this has been achieved. Many glycosyltransferases also show ordered sequential Bi Bi kinetic mechanisms where the donor substrate binds before the acceptor and the glycosylated acceptor leaves before the nucleotide product (22Qasba P.K. Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 53-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Moreover, both structural and thermodynamic data are beginning to emerge to suggest that donor substrate binding enhances or promotes binding of the acceptor in these enzymes (22Qasba P.K. Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 53-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 23Boix E. Zhang Y. Swaminathan G.J. Brew K. Acharya K.R. J. Biol.

The structures show that although C2GnT-L possesses the canonical GT-A fold, it lacks the characteristic metal ion binding DXD motif. The acceptor substrate complex defines the determinants of acceptor binding, and structural alignment shows that Glu-320 corresponds to the residue shown to be the catalytic base in other inverting GT-A fold glycosyltransferases. Structural alignment further suggests that the role played by the Mn2+ or Mg2+ ion in the metal ion-dependent GT-A structures is served by the basic amino acid residues Arg-378 and Lys-401 in C2GnT-L. This use of basic amino acid side chains is strikingly similar to that observed in a number of GT-B fold glycosyltransferases and provides structural evidence for a convergence of catalytic mechanism shared by both GT-A and GT-B fold glycosyltransferases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—A soluble form of C2GnT-L (residues 38-428) was expressed as an N-terminal protein A fusion protein from a stably transformed CHO cell line (24Zeng S. Dinter A. Eisenkratzer D. Biselli M. Wandrey C. Berger E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) kindly provided by Dr. J. Dennis. Protein production was scaled up in a Celligen 2.2 L New Brunswick bioreactor using the basket impeller containing 30 g of FibraCel disks (New Brunswick, M11769984). The bioreactor was run in perfusion mode using CHO-S-SFM II medium (Invitrogen, 12052-098) supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum, 2.25 g/liter glucose, 1× nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen, 11140-050), 1 mg/liter aprotinin (Bioshop, 9087-70-1), and 1× penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, 15140-148) at a media flow rate of ∼2 liters/day. The harvested medium was concentrated 10-fold, and the protein A·C2GnT-L fusion protein was purified by IgG-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography. The Protein A affinity tag was removed by elastase digestion, and the liberated C2GnT-L fragment was further purified by Phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction chromatography, which separated the protein A tag from the monomeric and dimeric forms of C2GnT-L. The dimeric form was then purified on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.02% NaN3 and concentrated to 10 mg/ml.For selenomethionine labeling, a selenomethionine-containing medium based on a serum-free formulation (25Sinacore M.S. Drapeau D. Adamson S.R. Mol. Biotechnol. 2000; 15: 249-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was made. Only the inorganic and amino acid components of that formulation were used, and both methionine and sodium selenite were omitted. This “medium” was then supplemented with 30 mg/liter seleno-l-methionine (Sigma, S3132), 3% fetal bovine serum, 4 g/liter glucose, 1× insulin-transferrin-selenium-G supplement (Invitrogen, 41400-045), 1× basal media Eagle's vitamins (Invitrogen, 21040-050), 1 × penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Invitrogen, 10378-016), 1× chemically defined lipid concentrate (Invitrogen, 11905-31), and 1 mg/liter aprotinin (Bioshop, 9087-70-1). After the bioreactor had been run as described above for 32 days (∼60 liters) in CHO-S-SFM II medium, the bioreactor was drained, and 1 reactor volume of the selenomethionine-containing medium was added. After 24 h the bioreactor was again drained (discarding the medium), and using the selenomethionine-containing medium, labeled protein was collected at a perfusion rate of 1.5 liters/day for 8 days.Crystallization and Data Collection—For both native and selenomethionine-labeled C2GnT-L, crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 1 μl of protein (10 mg/ml) with 1 μl of well solution (20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m glycine, pH 9.0, 0.6 m LiCl) and 0.22 μl of 33% 1,2,3-heptanetriol. These crystals were used for streak seeding/macroseeding into clear equilibrated drops prepared as described above but at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. Crystals typically grew to a size of ∼0.2 × 0.2 × 0.05 mm3 1 week after seeding. Galβ1-3GalNAc complexed crystals were grown in a similar manner by mixing 1 μl of protein (10 mg/ml), 1 μl of well solution (20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m glycine, pH 9.0, 0.6 m LiCl), 0.22 μl 1,2,3-heptanetriol, and 0.66 μl 30 mm Galβ1-3GalNAc (Toronto Research Chemicals, A152000). A 2.5 Å resolution multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion data set collected from selenomethionine crystals and a 2.0 Å native data set were collected on beamline F2 at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. Data from crystals of the Galβ1-3Gal-NAc complex were collected to 2.5 Å resolution on beamline 19-BM at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Data collection for all crystals was performed at 100 K using 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m glycine, 0.6 m LiCl, and 25% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. All data were processed using HKL/HKL2000 (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Methods in Enzymology. 276. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1997: 307-326Google Scholar).

Electron density maps were improved by histogram matching/solvent flattening using DM (29Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The structure was refined to 2.0 Å resolution using a combination of rigid body refinement, simulated annealing, positional refinement, and individual B-factor refinement as implemented in CNS 1.1. The P1 crystal form of the Galβ1-3GalNAc complex was solved using the C2 dimer as the molecular replacement model and refined to 2.7 Å resolution as described for the C2 crystal form. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverall Fold—The structure reported here is that of a soluble form of C2GnT-L (residues 38-428) lacking the N-terminal cytoplasmic (residues 1-16) and transmembrane (residues 17-34) regions (Fig. 1). A disulfide-linked dimer is found in the asymmetric unit, each monomer of which is composed of two distinct regions. The first region (residues 38-121) is composed solely of α-helices and likely corresponds to a stem that extends the catalytic domain into the lumen of the Golgi. It is relatively disordered having an average temperature factor of 45.0 Å2 with no interpretable electron density for residues 38-44 and 49-55. Both of the N-linked glycans reside in this stem region (Asn-58 and Asn-95), but interpretable electron density is seen only for the Asn-linked GlcNAc moiety in both cases. The second region, which corresponds to the catalytic domain (residues 122-428), is an α/β/α structure consisting of a central six-stranded mixed β-sheet with topology 3, 2, 1, 4, 6, 5 (all strands parallel except for strand 6) flanked on one side by α-helices and a small three-stranded β-sheet and on the other side by α-helices and small two- and three-stranded β-sheets (Fig. 1). The structure of the catalytic domain belongs to the GT-A fold, and a DALI search with C2GnT-L identified other GT-A glycosyltransferases, most significantly Rhodothermus marinus mannosylglycerate synthase (Z = 10.3) (20Flint J.

Yuwaraj S. Sarkar M. Schachter H. Rini J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5269-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Within the catalytic domain, residues 122-240, which include β-strands 3, 2, 1, and 4 of the central β-sheet, contain the binding site of the nucleotide portion of the donor substrate (36Tarbouriech N. Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These residues also correspond to those found to be the most structurally conserved among GT-A structures. Residues 241-428, which include β-strands 6 and 5 of the central β-sheet, contain the acceptor substrate binding site. Among GT-A structures there is little structural similarity in this region other than β-strands 6 and 5 and α-helix 5 where the catalytic base resides (see below).The monomers of the observed dimer are connected by a disulfide bond between Cys-235 on each of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit (r.m.s.d. between monomers = 0.37 Å). However, because the sample is predominantly monomeric when initially produced and Cys-235 is unique to murine C2GnT-L (Fig. 2), it is possible that this dimer does not represent a physiologically relevant form of the enzyme. Monomers and dimers can be separated from each other by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and gel filtration chromatography, and only the dimeric form was found to crystallize. With the exception of Cys-235 all of the other cysteine residues are conserved among C2GnT-L sequences, and in the structure eight are found to form intramolecular disulfide bonds and one is unpaired. The observed disulfide bond pattern is identical to that determined by mass spectrometric analysis (37Yen T.Y. Macher B.A. Bryson S. Chang X. Tvaroska I. Tse R. Takeshita S. Lew A.M. Datti A. J.

Two of the observed disulfide bonds (Cys-151—Cys-199 and Cys-372—Cys-381) connect structural elements within the catalytic domain, whereas the other two (Cys-59—Cys-413 and Cys-100—Cys-172) connect the putative stem region with the catalytic domain. The high temperature factor of the stem region and the lack of extensive protein-protein contacts between it and the catalytic domain suggest that its conformation and/or the observed disulfide bonds to it might differ in the full-length molecule, a form found to dimerize in the Golgi membrane (38El-Battari A.

The remaining cysteine, Cys-217, is unpaired and is located in the donor substrate binding site (as discussed below in more detail). It is conserved in all mammalian C2GnT-L, C2GnT-M, and C2GnT-T sequences (Fig. 2) and is responsible for the oxidative inactivation shown by C2GnT-L (39Yang X. Qin W. Lehotay M. Toki D. Dennis P.

The disaccharide Galβ1-3GalNAc binds in a solventexposed cleft, and strong electron density is observed for both the nonreducing Gal and the reducing GalNAc moieties (Fig. 3). Both of the monosaccharide moieties are in the low energy 4C1 chair conformation, and the φ/ψ values for the disaccharide (φ = 262.8 ± 2.9°, ψ(n-1) = 201.2 ± 7.8°, averaged over the four copies in the asymmetric unit) are very close to those of Galβ1-3GalNAc in its lowest energy conformation (40Lutteke T.

Glu-320, which is conserved among all C2GnT sequences, makes a bidentate interaction, accepting hydrogen bonds from both the O-4 and the nucleophilic O-6 of the GalNAc moiety. Glu-320 corresponds to the structurally conserved catalytic base shown through mutagenesis to be critical for activity in other GT-A fold glycosyltransferases (36Tarbouriech N. Charnock S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2054503007,"Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) ORF57 is a multifunctional, nuclear protein involved in post-transcriptional regulation of a subset of viral genes during lytic replication. Three nuclear localization signals (NLSs), NLS1 (amino acids (aa 101-107), NLS2 (aa 121-130), and NLS3 (aa 143-152), were identified in the N terminus of the ORF57 protein, and each of the three represents a short stretch of basic amino acid residues. Disruption of all three NLSs prevented localization of ORF57 in the nucleus. Insertion of individual NLSs into a heterologous cytoplasmic protein converted it into a nuclear protein, confirming that each NLS functions independently and is sufficient to promote protein nuclear localization. Although it exhibits a function similar to that of Epstein-Barr virus EB2 in promoting KSHV ORF59 expression, KSHV ORF57 differs from the herpes simplex virus ICP27 protein, and its function could be disrupted by point mutations of single or two NLSs in random combination, despite the proper localization of the mutant protein in the nucleus. The dysfunctional ORF57 containing NLS mutations also had low affinity with ORF59 RNA and the RNA export factor REF. However, the REF binding of ORF57 in vivo appeared to have no effect on ORF57-mediated enhancement of ORF59 expression. Thus, the three NLSs identified in ORF57 provide at least two functions, nuclear localization of ORF57 and up-regulation of ORF59 expression.

KSHV infection consists of two viral life cycles, as do other herpesviruses. Latent KSHV infection in Kaposi sarcoma tissues and B cell lines features the highly restricted expression of only five viral genes (6Zhong W. Wang H. Herndier B. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Virol. 1994; 68: 2468-2477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among these, ICP27 is a prototypical protein that interacts with RNA, inhibits host cell RNA splicing, and mediates nuclear export of intronless viral RNA (24Hardy W.R. Sandri-Goldin R.M. J.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Although the function of KSHV ORF57 is poorly understood, several lines of evidence suggest that it is involved in the regulation of KSHV gene expression. Similar to its homologs, KSHV ORF57 increases the accumulation of mRNA targets, particularly in the cytoplasm but has no global inhibitory effects on the expression of intron-containing viral genes (13Gupta A.K. Ruvolo V. Patterson C. Swaminathan S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1038-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Kirshner J.R. Lukac D.M. Chang J. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3586-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Through interactions with the RNA export factor Aly/REF (REF in this context), KSHV ORF57 has been thought to mediate nuclear export of mRNA targets in a CRM1-independent manner (28Malik P.

In contrast, a recent study in Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrated that animals with simultaneous depletion of all three REF proteins had no defects in mRNA export, suggesting that REF proteins are not necessary for mRNA export (34Longman D. Johnstone I.L. Caceres J.F. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2003; 9: 881-891Google Scholar). The mechanism by which KSHV ORF57 is translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to perform its nuclear roles has never been explored carefully. To provide further insight into KSHV ORF57 function, we identified three nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs in the N-terminal half of the protein that are necessary for its nuclear import. More importantly, these three NLS motifs were found to play additional important roles in ORF57-mediated enhancement of KSHV ORF59 expression. Plasmid Construction—To express the KSHV ORF57-GFP fusion protein in mammalian cells, a KSHV ORF57 cDNA from nt 82069 to 83541 in the KSHV genome was amplified by RT-PCR from JSC-1 cells, a KSHV+ and EBV+ B cell line (35Cannon J.S. Ciufo D. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Borowitz M.J. Hayward G.S. Ambinder R.F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10187-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), using a5′ primer (oVM68, 5′-TACTCAGAATTCACC/ATGGTACAAGCAATGATAGACATGG-3′) in combination with a 3′ primer (oVM70, 5′-ATCGTGGATCC/GAAAGTGGATAAAAGAATAAACCCTTG-3′). The cDNA without an intron was cloned in-frame at the GFP N terminus in the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) via its EcoRI and BamHI sites. The resulting plasmid was named pVM8. Various ORF57 mutants containing N-terminal truncations were created from plasmid pVM8 by PCR amplification using different 5′ primers positioned at various locations in combination with a common 3′ primer, oVM70. To optimize ORF57 expression in mammalian cells, all 5′ primers used for N-terminal truncation of ORF57 had an introduced EcoRI site, a Kozak sequence, and an ATG start codon. The following plasmids were constructed to encode truncated ORF57s: plasmid pVM21 for aa 31-455, plasmid pVM37 for aa 112-455, plasmid pVM31 for aa 137-455, and plasmid pVM20 for aa 167-455. ORF57 mutants containing C-terminal truncations were constructed with a similar strategy, but using a common 5′ primer, oVM68, in combination with different 3′ primers. The following plasmids were constructed to encode truncated ORF57s: plasmid pVM29 for aa 1-251, plasmid pVM30 for aa 1-173, plasmid pVM39 for aa 1-137, and plasmid pVM38 for aa 1-118. To create point mutations in the potential ORF57 NLS motifs, a set of two primers with a mutated target sequence was designed and used in combination with the 5′ primer oVM68 or the 3′ primer oVM70 for individual PCRs. The combined PCR products were further amplified by an overlapping PCR (36Zheng Z.M. Reid E.S. Baker C.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10612-10622Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Amplified products of the expected size were then cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector as described above. The following primers were used to introduce point mutations in the ORF57 NLS motifs: oVM76 (5′-AGCTACGGTAATAACATCGAGTTTGGAACCGCCGGT-3′) and oVM77 (5′-AAACTCGATGTTATTACCGTAGCTGTTTACTGGTGAG-3′) for the NLS1 point mutation in plasmid pVM10; oVM74 (5′-ATGAGTCCTCAGGGCGAACCAAGCGACGGCCTACAATACG-3′) and oVM75 (5′-GCCGTCGCTTGGTTCGCCCTGAGGACTCATTTCAGGGGGAGGA-3′) for the NLS 2 point mutation in plasmid pVM11, and oVM102 (5′-GACGCTGCACCGGAGCAAGCGACCGACGGTCCGCAGGTCAATTGC-3′) and oVM103 (5′-CGTCGGTCGCTTGCTCCGGTGCAGCGTCACACTGTCCGCCCCGTG-3′) for the NLS3 point mutation in plasmid pVM33. To generate a construct with point mutations in two of the three or in all three NLS motifs, the same approach was applied to generate the following constructs: plasmid pVM12 contains point mutations in both NLS1 and NLS2 and was derived from plasmid pVM10, plasmid pVM34 contains point mutations in both NLS1 and NLS3 and was also derived from plasmid pVM10, plasmid pVM36 has point mutations in both NLS2 and NLS3 and was derived from plasmid pVM11, and plasmid pVM35 has point mutations in all three NLS motifs and was derived from pVM12. To construct a truncated ORF57 (aa 1-251) with a FLAG tag on its C terminus with or without point mutations in the NLS motifs, pVM24 (wild type) and its mutant derivatives, pVM45 (mtNLS1), pVM46 (mtNLS2), pVM47 (mtNLS3), pVM48 (mtNLS1+2), pVM49 (mtNLS1+3), pVM50 (mtNLS2+3), and pVM51 (mtNLS1+2+3) were constructed by PCR from full-length ORF57-GFP vectors with corresponding NLS mutations. The resulting PCR products were cloned into a pFLAG-CMV-5.1 vector (Sigma) via the EcoRI and BamHI sites. Plasmid pVM68, expressing full-length ORF57 protein with 3xFLAG tags on the C terminus, was constructed by PCR from plasmid pVM8. The resulting PCR products were cloned via its EcoRI and BamHI sites into a p3xFLAG-CMV-14 vector (Sigma). Plasmid pKY15 was derived from plasmid pCMV-ICP27 (p320 from Dr. Sandri-Goldin) by inserting the HSV-1 ICP27 coding region into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pFLAG-CMV-5.1 vector. This plasmid has a Kozak element immediately upstream of the ICP27 ATG and expresses ICP27 as a fusion protein with a FLAG tag on its C terminus. To examine the capability of each ORF57 NLS to convert a cytoplasmic protein into a nuclear protein, an HPV6b E6 (6E6) protein was used. The 6E6 protein lacks a notable NLS and, when expressed as a GFP fusion in the expression vector pZMZ66 (37Tao M. Kruhlak M. Xia S. Androphy E. Zheng Z.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 13232-13247Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), is located mainly in the cytoplasm. To introduce individual ORF57 NLSs into 6E6, several sets of 6E6-ORF57 chimeric primers containing individual NLS sequences were used for various overlapping PCRs (36Zheng Z.M. Reid E.S. Baker C.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10612-10622Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the resulting insertions were confirmed by sequencing. Several plasmids were created with this approach as follows: plasmid pVM40 with an insertion of ORF57 NLS1, plasmid pVM41 with an insertion of ORF57 NLS2, and plasmids pVM43 and pVM44 with an insertion of ORF57 NLS3 with (pVM43) or without (pVM44) a proline residue immediately downstream. To express ORF59 in mammalian cells, the corresponding region (nt 95552-96739) was amplified from the KSHV genome on BAC36 DNA (38Zhou F.C. Zhang Y.J. Deng J.H. Wang X.P. Pan H.Y. Hettler E. Gao S.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6185-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) by PCR. The PCR product was then cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pFLAG-CMV-5.1, and the resulting plasmid pVM18 expresses ORF59 as an ORF59-FLAG fusion protein. All PCR amplifications were carried out using proofreading Tgo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science), and all constructs generated by PCR were verified by sequencing. Cotransfection and Western Blot—293 cells at 2 × 105/well were transfected with 200 ng of various testing plasmids together with 300 ng of pVM18 (ORF59-FLAG) using Lipofectamine 2000. Protein samples were collected 24 h after cotransfection by direct lysis of the cells in 2× SDS protein-sample buffer with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were sonicated for 1 min to shear genomic DNA, boiled for 5 min, resolved on a 4-12% BisTris-buffered NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) in 1× MES running buffer (Invitrogen), and blotted with the following antibodies: monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), monoclonal anti-human β-tubulin (IgM type) (Pharmingen), monoclonal anti-GFP (Clontech), and monoclonal anti-c-Myc (Sigma). Transfection and Imaging—To study the subcellular localization of ORF57-GFP fusion proteins, COS-1 cells in glass tissue culture chamber slides (BD Biosciences) were transfected with 300 ng of plasmid DNA, and 24 h after transfection were fixed with cold (-20 °C) 70% ethanol for 5 min, washed once with PBS, and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium containing 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylidnole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for DNA staining. Cell images were collected and processed into composite figures with Adobe Photoshop version 6.0 software. Extraction of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Total RNA—293 cells (5 × 105/well) in a 6-well plate were transfected with 600 ng of pVM18 and 400 ng of ORF57-GFP construct or pEGFP-N1 as a control. The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of total RNA were prepared 24 h after transfection. Briefly, after trypsinization, cells were washed with cold PBS, transferred into a 1.5-ml tube, and centrifuged at low speed. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 units of RNasin), incubated 5 min on ice, and spun 2 min at 3000 × g. The supernatant (cytoplasm) was transferred into a pre-chilled tube and used to extract cytoplasmic RNA, and the pellet was saved for the extraction of nuclear RNA by the addition of 1 ml of TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) for total RNA extraction. Northern Blot Analysis—Cytoplasmic or nuclear total RNA (5 μg) was mixed with NorthernMax formaldehyde load dye (Ambion, Austin, TX) and denatured at 75 °C for 15 min. One microliter of ethidium bromide (1 mg/ml) was added before loading. Samples were separated in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel in 1× MOPS buffer, transferred by capillary action onto a nylon membrane, and immobilized by UV light. Following1hof prehybridization, hybridization was carried out in PerfectHyb Plus hybridization buffer (Sigma) with the addition of sheared salmon sperm DNA (0.1 mg/ml). The ORF59-FLAG mRNA was detected with a γ-32P-labeled antisense probe (2 × 106 cpm; nt 95870-96171). GAPDH mRNA and U6 small nuclear RNA were separately probed with individual 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes (oZMZ270, 5′-TGAGTCCTTCCACGATACCAAA-3′, for GAPDH and oST197, 5′-AAAATATGGAACGCTTCACGA-3′, for U6 small nuclear RNA) as indicators of fractionation efficiency. The prehybridization and hybridizations were performed at 65 °C for 20 h, followed by one wash with 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS solution for 5 min at room temperature, and two washes with 0.2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 65 °C. Membranes were exposed to a phosphorimage screen, and the hybridization signals were captured using a PhosphorImager Storm 860 (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with ImageQuant software. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of ORF57-associated Proteins and RNAs—293 cells (5 × 105) transfected with 500 ng of ORF57-GFP fusion plasmid DNA were harvested 30 h after transfection into 1 ml of cold IP buffer (PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100) with the addition of Complete Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture (1×, catalog number 1836170; Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate). The samples were incubated 5 min on ice, briefly sonicated, and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. An equal amount (∼800 μg) of each extract was pre-cleared with 100 μl of pre-washed protein A/G-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Waltham, MA) for 1 h at 4°C. At the same time, 2.5 μl of polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Clontech) in 300 μl of IP buffer was added to 100 μl of pre-washed protein A/G-agarose beads and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The pre-cleaned cell extract was added to the antiGFP antibody-coated beads and incubated for4 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times at 4 °C with 1 ml of IP buffer, and the proteins on the beads were eluted into 70 μl of 2× SDS protein sample buffer with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Twenty microliters of each sample was blotted first with a monoclonal anti-REF antibody (11G5, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) and then reprobed with a monoclonal antiGFP antibody (JL-8, Clontech). IP of ORF57-associated ORF59 RNA from butyrate-activated JSC-1 cells was conducted using a polyclonal rabbit anti-ORF57 antibody. 3V. Majerciak and Z. M. Zheng, unpublished data. Briefly, JSC-1 cells (1 × 107) induced by butyrate (3 mm) were irradiated in a 10-cm Petri dish under UV light with a dose of 480,000 μJ/cm2. After removing the residual PBS from the cell pellet, the irradiated cells were then directly lysed into 400 μl of RIPA buffer and sonicated briefly. The cell lysates containing protein-RNA complexes were precleaned with preimmune rabbit serumcoated beads before being used for IP with anti-ORF57 antibody-coated beads. After extensive washes, the protein-RNA complexes in the immunoprecipitates were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and the purified RNAs were analyzed by RT-PCR for ORF59 RNA using the primer pair oST179 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGG/GTCACCTGATTGGCAGCC-3′) and oST180 (5′-AACGCATCGAG/CGGTGACTGTGTCTGTCAGC-3′). To examine the ORF57-ORF59 RNA interaction in vitro, 200 μg of total cell protein containing FLAG-tagged ORF57 with or without point mutations in its NLS motifs expressed from 293 cells or 500 ng of baculovirus-expressed, FLAG-tagged ORF57 were immobilized onto anti-FLAG antibodycoated beads (EZview Red Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel, Sigma) and then incubated with a pre-mixture of 4 ng of 32P-labeled ORF59 (∼1.1 kb), PAN (∼1 kb), K5 (∼0.8 kb), or luciferase RNA (∼1.1 kb) synthesized by in vitro transcription in the presence or absence of 35 μg of 293 cell nuclear extracts (NE) in 1× splicing buffer that had been mixed for 30 min on ice. Five hundred microliters of IP buffer were added, followed by1hof incubation at room temperature with gentle shaking. After extensive washes, protein-RNA complexes remaining on the beads were resuspended in scintillation solution (Cyto-Scint, MP, Irvine, CA), and the radioactivity from the complexes was counted in a β-counter. Three independent readings were determined for each sample, averaged, and adjusted by the amount of ORF57-FLAG fusion immobilized on the anti-FLAG beads as quantified by Western blot with 10 μl of the beads using an antiFLAG M2 antibody. Depletion of REF from 293 NE by IP and Knockdown of REF Expression from HeLa Cells by siRNAs—REF or hnRNP K proteins were depleted from 293 NE by IP using anti-hnRNP K (D-6, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-REF antibodies. The same amount of nonrelated anti-HPV16E7 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a mouse IgG control for depletion. The NE after depletion was then tested in an ORF59 RNA IP study using beads coated with a truncated form of ORF57-FLAG fusion as described above. To knock down REF expression from HeLa cells or 293 cells with an siRNA approach, 293 cells at 5 × 105 per well or HeLa cells at 3 × 105 per well were plated in a 6-well plate 1 day before transfection with 20 nm siRNA. The REF-specific siRNA duplex was purchased from Dharmacon as a SMART-pool against the THOC4 transcript (gene ID 10189). The siRNA duplex 198 complementary to HPV16E7 (39Tang S. Tao M. McCoy Jr., J.P. Zheng Z.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 4249-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), also from Dharmacon, was used as a nonspecific siRNA control. Twenty four hours after transfection, the cells in each well were split equally into two wells and cotransfected after attachment one more time with each siRNA (20 mm)ina mixture of ORF59 (pVM18) (3 μg/well) and GFP (pEGFP-N1 or pVM8, an ORF57-GFP expression vector) expression vectors (2 μg/well). A reduced amount of each plasmid with the same ratio was used in 293 cell cotransfections. Protein samples were collected 48 h after transfection by direct lysis of cells in 2× SDS protein sample buffer (500 μl for 293, 300 μl for HeLa) with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and blotted using anti-FLAG M2 for ORF59, anti-GFP (Clontech) for GFP and ORF57-GFP fusions, and anti-β-tubulin and anti-hnRNP K as loading controls. Putative Motifs in the KSHV ORF57 Protein—A protein sequence analysis showed that the 455-aa protein encoded by ORF57 contains multiple putative motifs (Fig. 1) and consists of over 30% basic/nucleophilic residues, most of which are clustered at the N terminus. The N-terminal half of ORF57 features a tandem array of four putative casein kinase II (CK2) phosphorylation sites (aa 20-39), four RS or SR dipeptides (aa 77-95), and a run of arginine residues (PPEKRPRRRPRDRLQYG; aa 122-130). Protein regions enriched in RS dipeptides and/or in arginine residues frequently harbor nuclear localization signals (37Tao M. Kruhlak M. Xia S. Androphy E. Zheng Z.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 13232-13247Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 40Hedley M.L. Amrein H. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In addition, the ORF57 protein contains two RGG boxes (aa 138-140 and aa 372-374) that might be involved in the RNA binding of the protein, as has been shown for other RNA-binding proteins (27Sandri-Goldin R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 29Sokolowski M. Scott J.E. Heaney R.P. Patel A.H. Clements J.B. J. Biol.

The N-terminal Half of KSHV ORF57 Contains Nuclear Localization Signals—Because KSHV ORF57 has been shown by other laboratories to be a nuclear protein, we decided to determine the intrinsic properties of ORF57 that dictate its nuclear localization. A full-length cDNA of KSHV ORF57 obtained from butyrate-induced JSC-1 cells was cloned in-frame in the N terminus of GFP in a pEGFP-N1 vector. The resulting plasmid, pVM8, expresses a 455-aa ORF57-GFP fusion protein (Fig. 2, A and B). Although the ORF57 cDNA construct from JSC-1 cells has one nucleotide change (T to C) at nt 82959 in the virus genome as that noticed from BCBL-1 cells (14Kirshner J.R. Lukac D.M. Chang J. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3586-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the single-base mutation is silent and does not result in the translation of a different amino acid. When expressed in 293 cells or COS-1 cells, the full-length, wild type (WT) ORF57 fusion protein showed exclusive nuclear localization with typical s"

This contribution may be mediated in part through MMP-2 activation by MT2-MMP. Using Timp2-/- cells, we previously demonstrated that MT2-MMP activates MMP-2 to the fully active form in a pathway that is TIMP-2-independent but MMP-2 hemopexin carboxyl (C) domain-dependent. In this study cells expressing MT2-MMP as well as chimera proteins in which the C-terminal half of MT2-MMP and MT1-MMP were exchanged showed that the MT2-MMP catalytic domain has a higher propensity than that of MT1-MMP to initiate cleavage of the MMP-2 prodomain in the absence of TIMP-2. Although we demonstrate that MT2-MMP is a weak collagenase, this first activation cleavage was enhanced by growing the cells in type I collagen gels. The second activation cleavage to generate fully active MMP-2 was specifically enhanced by a soluble factor expressed by Timp2-/- cells and was MT2-MMP hemopexin C domain-dependent; however, the RGD sequence within this domain was not involved. Interestingly, in the presence of TIMP-2, a MT2-MMP·MMP-2 trimolecular complex formed, but activation was not enhanced. Similarly, TIMP-3 did not promote MT2-MMP-mediated MMP-2 activation but inhibited activation at higher concentrations. This study demonstrates the influence that both the catalytic and hemopexin C domains of MT2-MMP exert in determining TIMP independence in MMP-2 activation. In tissues or pathologies characterized by low TIMP-2 expression, this pathway may represent an alternative means of rapidly generating low levels of active MMP-2.

Recruitment of secreted proteases to the cell surface not only increases the proteolytic repertoire of a cell but also results in high local concentrations of the proteases. A level of control is achieved through focal proteolysis (1Itoh Y. Seiki M. J. Cell.

The MMP family is a large group of zinc-dependent endopeptidases comprising both secreted and membrane-anchored (referred to as membrane-type (MT)-MMPs) enzymes that are regulated by the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Control of secreted MMPs, such as MMP-2 (also known as gelatinase A), is also maintained through their expression as inactive zymogens, which require processing of the prodomain to attain full activity (4Gomis-Ruth F.X. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 24: 157-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).

Activation of MMP-2 by MT1-MMP occurs in a two step process; the first cleavage within the MMP-2 prodomain (between Asn37-Leu38) is mediated by an active MT1-MMP molecule to generate the intermediate (68-kDa) form of MMP-2 (38Will H.

Because the second activation step was blocked by exogenous MMP-2 hemopexin C domain, it was concluded that it had to be mediated by a membrane-localized rather than soluble, active MMP-2 molecule (41Overall C.M.

Whereas the first activation step of MMP-2 by MT1-MMP can occur in the absence of TIMP-2, the second activation step is absolutely TIMP-2-dependent(16Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bigg H.F. Roberts C.R.

A number of alternative MT1-MMP-dependent activation pathways for MMP-2 have been reported involving proteases such as thrombin (43Lafleur M.A. Hollenberg M.D. Atkinson S.J. Knauper V. Murphy G.

Interestingly, a TIMP-independent MMP-2 activation pathway that is mediated by MT1-MMP and the tight-endothelial junction protein claudin-5 has been reported (46Miyamori H. Takino T. Kobayashi Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26411-26415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), we have shown that MT2-MMP activates MMP-2 in a TIMP-2-independent pathway that is clearly distinct from that of MT1-MMP (16Morrison C.J.

Full activation of MMP-2 by MT2-MMP proceeded via the 68-kDa intermediate but occurred more rapidly than MT1-MMP-mediated activation. TIMP-2 had no enhancing effect on the level of active MMP-2 generated by MT2-MMP. In addition, activation by MT2-MMP required localization of MMP-2 at the cell surface in a MMP-2 hemopexin C domain-dependent but TIMP-2-independent manner. In this study we use Timp2-/- cells transfected for stable cell surface expression of MT2-MMP as well as chimera proteins in which the C-terminal half of MT2-MMP and MT1-MMP are exchanged to dissect the contribution that the different domains of MT2-MMP make to influence TIMP-independent activation of MMP-2. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification Hemopexin C Domains—The cDNA encoding the linker (L) and hemopexin C domain (CD) (Thr305-Cys559) of MT2-MMP (MT2-MMP LCD) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGYMX (51Steffensen B.

Unlike MMP-2 and MT1-MMP LCDs, additional steps were required to purify MT2-MMP LCD to homogeneity. After elution of MT2-MMP LCD from the Ni2+-chelate column (GE Healthcare) (Vt = 40 ml) in 400 mm imidazole, the eluate was dialyzed into 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and loaded onto a CM-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) (Vt = 5 ml). MT2-MMP LCD was eluted in 20 mm phosphate buffer, 1 m NaCl, pH 7.5. After dialysis into 20 mm 1,3-diaminopropane, pH 8.5, the MT2-MMP LCD was then loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) (Vt = 2 ml) to remove contaminants, and the unbound fraction containing MT2-MMP LCD was collected. After increasing the pH to 10.9, it was reloaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (Vt = 2 ml), and the bound MT2-MMP LCD eluted using a 1 m NaCl gradient. Purified LCDs were stored in 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, and concentrations were determined using the predicted molar extinction coefficients. The identities of the LCDs were confirmed by Western blot analysis, N-terminal Edman sequencing, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a Voyager-DE STR Biospectrometry Work station (ABI) or electrospray ionization-TOF as previously described (54Tam E.M.

Full-length MT-MMPs—Expression of full-length human MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP constructs in Timp2-/- skin fibroblasts was described in Morrison et al. (16Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bigg H.F. Roberts C.R.

The cDNA encoding full-length MT1-MMP containing a FLAG tag (DYK-DDDDK) inserted between Gly511-Gly512 in the stalk region of the protein (MT1-MMP FLAG) was kindly provided by Dr. Sharon Stack (Northwestern University, Chicago) (55Wu Y.I.

Mutagenesis was used to introduce a FLAG sequence flanked by two Gly codons at 1753 bp in the MT2-MMP cDNA. This construct encodes MT2-MMP with the Gly-flanked FLAG tag inserted between Gly581-Gly582 residues in the stalk region of the protein (MT2-MMP FLAG). The double Gly residues at each end of the tag were designed for flexibility. The FLAG-tagged MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP constructs were used to generate chimera constructs, in which the 3′ end of MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP (after 957 and 1110 bp, respectively) were exchanged. This was achieved using PCR to introduce unique SspI sites (AATATT) by silent mutation in the MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP cDNAs. These sites were then used in cloning. The constructs generated encode proteins in which the C-terminal half of MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP is exchanged after Cys319 and Cys370, respectively. The resulting chimera proteins are termed MT1catL/MT2CD-MMP and MT2catL/MT1CD-MMP. All MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP constructs described were cloned into the pGW1GH vector and were used to transfect Timp2-/- fibroblasts using conditions described in Morrison et al. (16Morrison C.J.

Positive clones were identified by flow cytometry using an anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and by screening for MMP-2 activation in the presence and absence of 10 nm TIMP-2. Soluble MT-MMP (sMT-MMP)—PCR was used to introduce a FLAG sequence at the 3′ end of the sMT1-MMP cDNA used previously in Bigg et al. (42Bigg H.F. Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bogoyevitch M.A. Wang Z.

Cells were grown in 500-ml baffled shaker flask cultures, and after 24 h, 0.5% methanol was added to induce sMT1-MMP expression. Culture medium was diluted in MES buffer (final concentration, 50 mm MES, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 0.05% Brij, pH 6.2) and sMT1-MMP was purified upon binding to reactive red agarose (Sigma) (Vt = 30 ml). After washing, the column was eluted with 1 m NaCl in MES buffer. Fractions containing sMT1-MMP were pooled and dialyzed into 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. A cDNA construct was generated by PCR that encodes C-terminal FLAG-tagged sMT2-MMP truncated at Gln560. The construct was cloned into the pGW1GH vector and used to transfect Timp2-/- cells (16Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bigg H.F. Roberts C.R. Soloway P.D. Overall C.M. J. Biol.

All TIMPs were active site-titrated against a standard preparation of active MMP-8 to determine their concentrations. ProMMP-2—TIMP-2-free human proMMP-2 was expressed in Timp2-/- cells as previously described (16Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bigg H.F. Roberts C.R. Soloway P.D. Overall C.M. J. Biol.

Timp2-/- cells expressing MT2-MMP or transfected with pGW1GH vector alone were also grown on or in a native type I collagen matrix Vitrogen® (Cohesion Technologies, Inc.) (2.3 mg/ml). Neutralized collagen alone or collagen premixed with cells at 5 × 106 cells/ml (50 μl/well) were added to a 96-well plate, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to form collagen fibril gels. Then 100 μl/well of cells at 5 × 106 cells/ml in DMEM with 10% serum was added to wells containing collagen alone or to empty wells as a control. DMEM with 10% serum (100 μl/well) was added to the wells containing cells embedded in collagen. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, collagen gels with cells were washed extensively in PBS and incubated under serum-free conditions in the presence of 5 nm TIMP-2-free proMMP-2. In all cell assays, supernatants were collected after 24 h and analyzed by gelatin zymography using 8% polyacrylamide gels as described (16Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bigg H.F. Roberts C.R.

All three satellite orbits are nearly coplanar, implying a common origin. It has been argued that Charon formed as a result of a giant impact with primordial Pluto. The orbital periods of the two new moons are nearly integer multiples of Charon's period, suggesting that they were driven outward by resonant interactions with Charon during its tidal orbital expansion. This could have been accomplished if Charon's orbit was eccentric during most of this orbital evolution, with the small moons originating as debris from the collision that produced Charon."

One of the most remarkable aspects of UvrA is that it can recognize a wide range of DNA lesions that differ in chemistry and structure. However, how UvrA interacts with DNA is unknown. To examine the role that the UvrA C-terminal zinc finger domain plays in DNA binding, an eleven amino acid deletion was constructed (ZnG UvrA). Biochemical characterization of the ZnG UvrA protein was carried out using UvrABC DNA incision, DNA binding and ATPase assays. Although ZnG UvrA was able to bind dsDNA slightly better than wild-type UvrA, the ZnG UvrA mutant only supported 50-75% of wild type incision. Surprisingly, the ZnG UvrA mutant, while retaining its ability to bind dsDNA, did not support damage-specific binding. Furthermore, this mutant protein only provided 10% of wild-type Bca UvrA complementation for UV survival of an uvrA deletion strain. In addition, ZnG UvrA failed to stimulate the UvrB DNA damage-associated ATPase activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis was used to monitor UvrB loading onto damaged DNA with wild-type UvrA or ZnG UvrA. The ZnG UvrA protein showed a 30-60% reduction in UvrB loading as compared with the amount of UvrB loaded by wild-type UvrA.

In prokaryotes, nucleotide excision repair requires the collaborative action of UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC. The fundamental process of DNA damage recognition is central to the function of UvrA and the overall repair reaction. It is believed that UvrA initially recognizes the damage-induced distortion in the DNA, and then hands off the damaged DNA to UvrB, so that UvrB can make a more detailed assessment of the nature of the helical perturbation. Once on DNA, UvrB is responsible for preparing the DNA for incision by the two nuclease centers of UvrC (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Van Houten B. Croteau D.L. DellaVecchia M.J. Wang H. Kisker C.

In a general way, NER proteins fulfill all the criteria of a kinetic proofreading mechanism for damage processing: 1) damage specificity is not absolute; 2) ATP is consumed to generate irreversible intermediates and to delay initial binding and processing from incision, and 3) dissociation of UvrA or UvrA/UvrB from DNA or lack of stimulating the UvrC nuclease domains help safeguard against inappropriate incision (4Reardon J.T.

However, the precise mechanism by which UvrA and UvrB effectively recognize DNA damage in a sea of non-damaged DNA is unknown and of critical importance.UvrA is a large protein, ∼105 kDa, possessing two ATP-binding cassette-type ATPases (ABC ATPase) and two zinc finger domains (5Doolittle R.F. Johnson M.S. Husain I. Van Houten B. Thomas D.C. Sancar A. Nature. 1986; 323: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 6Navaratnam S. Myles G.M. Strange R.W. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16067-16071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was recently reviewed in Ref. 3Croteau D.L. Dellavecchia M.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B. Wolfram S. Kow Y.W. Doetsch P.W. DNA Damage Recognition. Taylor & Francis, Boca Raton, FL2005: 111-138Google Scholar. The conserved motifs of the ABC ATPase are not contiguous, but are interrupted after the Walker A and before the signature sequence, LSGG, with an insertion sequence containing the conserved zinc fingers. The two ABC ATPases are connected through a flexible protease-sensitive linker region. Therefore, both the N- and C-terminal ABC ATPase domains are separable, and each has been shown to possess some DNA binding capacity (7Myles G.M. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3834-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because of the presence of the ATPase domains, DNA binding by UvrA is regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. Whereas nucleotide binding by UvrA is not absolutely required for DNA binding, ATP binding promotes the dimerization of UvrA (8Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), which in turn facilitates DNA binding (9Mazur S. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, ATP hydrolysis is believed to drive UvrA dimer dissociation and consequently reduces DNA binding (10Reardon J.T. Nichols A.F. Keeney S. Smith C.A. Taylor J.S. Linn S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21301-21308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Thiagalingam S. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18382-18389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this general picture, the precise mechanistic details of how nucleotide binding and hydrolysis regulate the UvrA DNA binding are not known.Zinc fingers are a common structural element utilized by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins to interact with DNA (12Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). However, zinc fingers also mediate protein-protein, protein-RNA, and protein-ligand interactions (13Matthews J.M. Sunde M. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Currently, there are 64 families of zinc fingers listed in the PROSITE data base, yet neither of UvrA zinc fingers shares strong homology to any of these family members. Previously, investigators mutagenized the zinc-coordinating cysteines of Escherichia coli UvrA C-terminal zinc finger producing bacteria that were UV-sensitive and NER-defective (14Visse R. de Ruijter M. Ubbink M. Brandsma J.A. van de Putte P. Mutat. Res. 1993; 294: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Wang J. Grossman L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10771-10775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we re-investigated the role of the UvrA C-terminal zinc finger in the NER reaction. A mutant of Bacillus caldotenax UvrA (Bca UvrA) was generated by substituting a glycine for eleven of the highly conserved amino acids within the C-terminal zinc finger. The mutant protein, ZnG UvrA, was purified and characterized. Our results demonstrate that the mutant ZnG UvrA can bind dsDNA, but has lost its damage-specific dsDNA binding, and cannot complement for in vivo UV resistance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProteins—The C-terminal ABC ATPase domain (CABC fragment) of uvrABca was amplified using the following primers (5′-GCG ACC GGA TCC ATG CTG GCC GCG GAC TAT TTG and 5′-GAG AGA GCG GCC GCT TAC GCC TTC ACC GCT TCA TAT TG) and the Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The CABC fragment includes nucleotides 1643 to the end of the uvrABca gene; thus this fragment includes the linker region and the C-terminal ABC motifs, amino acids 549-952. The PCR fragment was cloned into a Topo cloning vector, pCRBII-TOPO, then transferred into the pGEX4T1 vector by digestion with BamH1 and NotI to create pGEX4T1-Wt CABC.Construction of the ZnG deletion mutant of pGEX-CABC was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene using pGEX4T1-Wt CABC as template, primers (5′-CAT GGC GAT GGC ATC ATC GGT GTC CCG TGC GAA GTG TGC CAC and 5′-GTG GCA CAC TTC GCA CGG GAC ACC GAT GAT GCC ATC GCC ATG) and Pfu turbo DNA polymerase. An alignment of the zinc finger region showing which amino acids are deleted is depicted in Fig. 1.To place the ZnG mutation into the full-length uvrA gene, the BseR1 and NcoI fragment from pGEX4T1-ZnG CABC was removed, gel-purified, and ligated into the BseR1/NcoI (New England Biolabs) double-digested, artic phosphatase-treated pTYB1-Wt uvrABca vector, thus completing the construction of pTYB1-ZnG uvrABca.The plasmid coding for GST-ZnF, pGEX6p1-ZnF was created by PCR amplification of nucleotides 2002-2463 by Pfu turbo DNA polymerase primers (5′-ATA GGG ATC CGG CGA GCA CCG CGA CAT TC and 5′-ACA CGC GGC CGC GCC GAG CTT CAT ATA ACC). The PCR fragment was cloned into a Topo cloning vector, pCRBII-TOPO, then transferred into the pGEX6p1 vector by digestion with BamH1 and NotI to create pGEX6p-ZnF.The inserts of all vectors were sequenced. Upon re-sequencing the pTYB1-Wt uvrABca expression vector, we discovered several sequence variations from the original Bca UvrA sequence deposited in Entrez, accession number AAK29748. There were a total of fourteen amino acid changes; however none reside within any conserved sequence elements, (sequence conservation defined as 70% or more identity among 24 UvrA homologues). The majority of the variations, 13 of the 14, were in the poorly conserved linker region. Of all the variations, only linker region substitution Phe600 to Thr600 is unique to the new Bca UvrA sequence. The remaining amino acid changes exist in at least one or more UvrA homologues. The Wt UvrA, ZnG UvrA, Wt GST-CABC, and ZnG GST-CABC proteins used in this study share these fourteen amino acid substitutions.Expression and Purification of the Proteins-Bca Wt UvrA, Bca ZnG UvrA, Bca Wt UvrB, Bca Δβ-hairpin UvrB, and Thermatoga maritima Wt UvrC (Tma UvrC)—All proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) RIL cells (Stratagene) and purified using the T7 IMPACT™ system (New England Biolabs) by standard procedures. The GST-containing proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) RIL cells (Stratagene) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare). The GST-containing proteins were eluted from the column with reduced glutathione (10 mm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 0.25% Triton X-100, then dialyzed into storage buffer. UvrA, UvrB, and the GST fusion proteins were maintained at -20 °C in storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol) until use.DNA Substrates—DNA substrates were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys. The DNA sequence of the 50-mer double-stranded substrate containing a single internal fluorescein (FldT) adduct was: F2650 5′-GAC TAC GTA CTG TTA CGG CTC CAT C[FldT]C TAC CGC AAT CAG GCC AGA TCT GC-3′ while the non-damaged complementary bottom strand was NDB, 5′-GCA GAT CTG GCC TGA TTG CGG TAG CGA TGG AGC CGT AAC AGT ACG TAG TC-3′. The non-damaged strand, NDT, has the same sequence as F2650 except it contains a dT at the position of FldT. The DNA was 5′ end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) according to standard procedures. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA (20 mm), and the enzyme was heat-denatured by incubation for 10 min at 65 °C. Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed by gel filtration chromatography (Biospin-6, Bio-Rad). The labeled oligonucleotide was annealed with equimolar amounts of the complementary oligonucleotide.When referring to the oligonucleotide duplexes, the strand listed first is the one that is 5′ end-labeled. The double-stranded character of the oligonucleotide duplex was analyzed on a native 10% polyacrylamide gel.UV Survival Assay—WP2 uvrA- trp- cells (Mol Tox, Inc., Boone, NC) were incubated with 50 ng of pT7pol26 plasmid (Gentaur, Belgium) and 50 ng of pTYB1(New England Biolabs), pTYB1-Wt UvrABca or pTYB1-ZnG UvrABca for 10 min. Wt WP2 cells (MolTox, Inc.) were incubated with 50 ng of pT7pol26 and 50 ng of pTYB1 or pTYB1-ZnG for 10 min. Transformations were carried out in cuvettes with a 0.2-cm electrode gap using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) electroporator with peak discharge at 2.4 kV, resistance set at 100 ohms and capacitance set to 25 microfarads. Immediately following transformation, cells were transferred into 250 μl of SOC broth. After 1 h of shaking at 37 °C, the entire culture was spread onto LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Individual colonies were selected and grown to an A600 of ∼1.0. Then the cell culture was diluted 2-fold, and the proteins were induced by addition of IPTG (0.1 mm) for 1 h at 37 °C. This concentration of IPTG gave low, but detectable levels of UvrA protein. In duplicate, three serial dilutions of each sample of culture (100 μl) were spread onto LB plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin and UV-irradiated. The appropriate UV dose was calculated by measuring the fluency from an 8-watt 254-nm germicidal lamp using a 254-nm UVX Radiometer (UVP Inc.). Serial dilutions of unirradiated cultures were also plated and used to determine the plating efficiency of each transformant. The number of colonies obtained after 20 h of incubation at 37 °C was recorded, and the percent survival calculated from the plating efficiency of the nonirradiated controls. Two or three independent experiments were performed for each sample. The mean survival of two-three independent experiments is plotted as a function of UV fluence.Incision Assay—Prior to initiation of the incision assay, the UvrABC proteins were heated to 65 °C for 10 min. The 5′-end-labeled duplex DNA (2 nm, F2650/NDB) was treated with UvrABC (20 nm Wt or ZnG Bca UvrA, 100 nm Bca UvrB, and 50 nm Tma UvrC) in 20 μl of UvrABC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 5 mm DTT) at 55 °C for the indicated time. For those reactions containing supercoiled undamaged plasmid DNA, varying concentrations of pUC19 DNA (New England Biolabs) were included as labeled in the figure legend. The reactions were terminated by addition of EDTA (20 mm). Ten percent of the reaction was removed, denatured with formamide and heated to 85 °C for 5 min. Incision products were resolved on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis was performed at 325 V in Tris borate-EDTA buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) for 40 min. Gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics) overnight. The percent of the DNA incised was calculated using the Molecular Dynamics software, ImageQuant to determine the band intensities within each lane. The percentage of DNA incised is reported as the mean ± S.D. (n = 3).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—For UvrA·DNA EMSAs, the binding reactions were performed with duplexed DNA substrate (2 nm) and protein (concentrations as indicated in the figure legend) in 20-μl reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm DTT, and 1 μm bovine serum albumin) for 15 min at 37 °C or 55 °C (as indicated in the figure legend). The reactions were loaded onto a 3.5% native polyacrylamide gel (29:1; acrylamide:bis). For EMSAs containing ATP and magnesium, the gels and running buffer contained 44.5 mm Tris pH 8.3, 44.5 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2. For EMSAs without ATP and magnesium, the gels and running buffer contained 44.5 mm Tris, 44.5 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA. Electrophoresis was carried out for 1 h at 100 V with the gel rigs at 4 °C. The gels were dried and exposed to a phosphorimager screen. The percent of DNA bound in the various protein-DNA complexes was calculated based on the total radioactivity in the lane. The percentage is reported as the mean ± S.D. (n = 3). Data are reported as the fraction of DNA-bound, including higher order multimers, versus protein concentration and fitted by nonlinear regression analysis (17Schofield M.J. Lilley D.M. White M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7733-7740Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).For the UvrA·UvrB·DNA EMSAs, the enzymes were preheated to 65 °C for 10 min prior to initiation of the reactions and UvrA·UvrB reaction mixtures. Binding reactions were performed with 2 nm F2650/NDB and Wt UvrA (20 nm) or ZnG UvrA (20 nm) and Wt UvrB (100 nm) in 20 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm DTT, and 1 μm bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 55 °C. For those lanes that contain additional plasmid DNA, a 100-fold molar excess of pUC DNA (molar excess relative to the concentration of oligonucleotide in base pairs) was added prior to adding the oligonucleotide to the reactions. The reactions were loaded onto a 4% native polyacrylamide gel (29:1, acrylamide:bis) and subjected to electrophoresis at 100 V for 1 h, 4 °C. The gels and buffers contained 44.5 mm Tris, 44.5 mm boric acid and 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2.ATP Hydrolysis Assay—The conversion of ATP to ADP by the UvrAB system was monitored using a coupled enzyme assay system consisting of pyruvate kinase and lactic dehydrogenase to couple the hydrolysis of ATP to the oxidation of NADH (ϵ340 nm = 6220 m-1 cm-1). ATP (Roche Applied Science) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 55 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 12.6 units/ml l-lactic dehydrogenase (Sigma), 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase (Sigma), 2 mm phosphoenol pyruvate (Roche Applied Science), 0.15 mm NADH (Roche Applied Science), 50 nm Bca UvrA (Wt or mutants), and 100 nm Bca UvrB. The Bca proteins were preheated to 65 °C for 10 min prior to initiation of the reactions. Each protein was assayed in the absence of DNA as well as in the presence of supercoiled pUC19 (SC DNA, 10 ng/μl) or UV-irradiated pUC18 DNA (UV DNA, 10 ng/μl) substrate. The UV-damaged DNA was prepared by exposure of 1 μg/μl pUC18 plasmid DNA to 200 J/m2 for 1 min. The rate of hydrolysis was calculated from the linear change in absorbance at 340 nm at either 37 or 55 °C over a 20-30-min period, using a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer. In addition, the rates were blank corrected for the oxidation of NADH (+ATP) in the absence of additional proteins. For ATPase reactions at 37 °C, the proteins were not preheated prior to the assay. For those reactions at 55 °C, the data are reported as the mean rate (M/min) ± S.D. (n = 3 or 4).Creation of the Zinc Finger Structural Model—The C-terminal zinc finger domain was modeled based on an alignment with the coordinates from the solved structure of Ydj1. Ydj1, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae dnaJ homologue, is a protein chaperone involved in the regulation of Hsp90 and Hsp70 (18Caplan A.J. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 19Kimura Y. Yahara I. Lindquist S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10412-10419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The structure of Ydj1 was solved in complex with its peptide substrate (PDB code 1NLT) (21Li J. Qian X. Sha B. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1475-1483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The Ydj1 zinc finger structure was selected as the template to model the UvrA zinc finger as they share a conserved CXXCXGXG sequence, which is common to this zinc finger protein family, referred to as DNAJ_CXXCXGXG (Pfam record PF00684, Ref. 22Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D138-D141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the DnaJ family of proteins, CXXCXGXG is repeated four times. In the C-terminal domain of UvrA, the sequence CXXCXGX(R/K) is repeated twice. The lysine-containing consensus is also found among the DnaJ proteins. From the 20 DnaJ protein sequences that form the Pfam seed alignment for Pfam record PF00684, the CXXCXGX(R/K) is found 30% of the time within the fourth DnaJ repeat. The sequence alignment of Ydj1 and several UvrA proteins used to develop the structural model for the UvrA C-terminal zinc finger is shown in Fig. 1.Development of a Structural Model for the ABC ATPase within the C-terminal Domain of UvrA, Residues 603-713 and 801-935—A comparative model was developed using structural (DALI/FSSP, VAST) and sequence (T-Coffee, ClustalW) alignments of solved ABC transporter proteins including the MalK ATPase subunit of maltose ABC transporter (PDB code 1G29, Ref. 23Diederichs K. Diez J. Greller G. Muller C. Breed J. Schnell C. Vonrhein C. Boos W. Welte W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5951-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), the MJ0796 ATP-binding cassette protein (PDB code 1L2T, Ref. 24Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), and the ATP binding subunit of histidine permease (PDB code 1B0U, Ref. 25Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). These structures were selected because they were solved at high resolution (1.9, 1.7, and 1.5 Å, respectively) and shared the highest sequence similarity with UvrA. Coordinates from all three solved structures contributed to the model; however, the majority was from 1B0U, which shares 32% sequence identity with UvrA in the ABC transporter domain regions. The RMS deviation between the solved ABC transporter structures used to develop the UvrA model was 3.7-3.9 Å (backbone Cα). The ATP was placed in the model UvrA structure based on the position of ATP within the histidine permease solved structure (PDB code 1B0U). The distances between the ATP atoms and atoms of the ABC ATPase-conserved motifs (Walker A, Q-loop, ABC signature, Walker B, and His-loop) were optimized. The model was manually edited using the Accelrys InsightII Homology Module Software. The final model was subjected to minimization and short (200 ps) molecular dynamics runs to resolve discontinuities with CHARMm. The RMS deviation between the final UvrA ABC transporter monomer model and the 1B0U PDB structure is 3.2 Å.A model for the UvrA C-terminal dimer was constructed using the solved Rad50 dimer structure (PDB codes: 1F2U, 1F2T) as a model template for the interactions between the two monomeric C-terminal ABC transporter domains of UvrA. Each UvrA monomer was superimposed onto each of the Rad50 monomers so that the UvrA dimer structural interactions would simulate that of the Rad50 dimer organization. ATP atoms and the conserved atoms belonging to the ABC transporter motifs were used for the superposition of each of the ABC monomeric units with the Rad50 monomer to create UvrA C-terminal dimer model coordinates. The RMS deviation between the Rad50 dimer and UvrA C-terminal dimer is 4.8 Å.RESULTSDesign and Construction of ZnG UvrA—Prior research on the UvrA C-terminal zinc finger focused on disrupting the zinc-coordinating amino acids. Specifically, substitution of E. coli UvrA C-terminal zinc finger cysteine, C763F, produced a protein that was unable to bind dsDNA; therefore, this led to the hypothesis that the C-terminal zinc finger region of UvrA was responsible for DNA binding (16Wang J. Mueller K.L. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10771-10775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Visse et al. (14Visse R. de Ruijter M. Ubbink M. Brandsma J.A. van de Putte P. Mutat. Res. 1993; 294: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) also mutated one of the C-terminal cysteines and noted that the structural stability of the mutant protein was impaired. The zinc ion plays an important role in the structural architecture of zinc fingers and mutagenesis of the zinc-anchoring cysteines probably disrupts the global fold of the C-terminal ABC ATPase domain.Unlike many other zinc finger DNA-binding proteins (13Matthews J.M. Sunde M. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), UvrA is not a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. Furthermore, close inspection of the amino acids within and around the C-terminal zinc finger reveals that the conserved amino acids tend to be hydrophobic, whereas only a few are positively charged residues, which may be available to interact with the DNA phosphate backbone. For these reasons, we re-investigated the role of the C-terminal zinc finger domain of UvrA.A multiple sequence alignment of the UvrA C-terminal zinc finger region is displayed in Fig. 1A. Inspection of the sequences reveals a common motif: C(D/E)XCXGXGX3(I/V)EMXFLPDX4 C(D/E)XCXG. Note that there are conserved glycines after each set of cysteines. The dnaJ family of proteins possess a similar zinc finger signature; however dnaJ proteins have 4 repeats of CX2CXGX(G/K). The structure of the yeast DnaJ homolog, Ydj1, has been solved (PDB 1NLT, Ref. 21Li J. Qian X. Sha B. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1475-1483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and its model is shown in Fig. 1B. A model of the UvrA C-terminal zinc finger was created based on the structure of the ZnII domain of Ydj1 because it contains 22 amino acids between the conserved cysteines, similar to the UvrA spacing of 19 amino acids, (Fig. 1C). Based on the structural model and sequence alignments, a deletion mutant of UvrA was created. This deletion mutant replaced eleven of the amino acids within the C-terminal finger with a single glycine residue (Fig. 1A).In Vivo Complementation and Survival—In vivo complementation and UV survival studies were conducted in the WP2 uvrA- strain. Transformation of WP2 uvrA- cells with plasmids encoding T7 polymerase and Bca Wt UvrA increases the cells UV survival by more than 382-fold, pTYB1 versus pTYB1-Wt UvrA, when exposed to 5 J/m2 of UV. These results indicate that at 37 °C, Bca Wt UvrA can complement the E. coli system. In contrast, transformation of pTYB1-ZnG UvrA versus pTYB1 only confers a 43-fold increase in UV survival following 5 J/m2 of UV. The UV survival differences between Wt UvrA and ZnG UvrA transformed samples varied between 8.6-12.4-fold. Clearly, the ZnG UvrA protein is defective at some step in the NER reaction because it provides a lower level of UV protection than Wt Bca UvrA.Wild-type WP2 cells were also included in the UV survival analysis. Even though Wt Bca UvrA provided significant protection from UV, it did not provide the same level of defense as endogenous E. coli UvrA, compare Wt WP2 with Wt UvrA in Fig. 2. Bca UvrA was 3-10-fold less effective after UV than endogenous E. coli UvrA. The ZnG UvrA containing vector was also transformed into the Wt WP2 cells to determine if ZnG UvrA would be a dominant negative mutation. The Wt WP2 cells expressing ZnG UvrA do not display a greater sensitivity to UV than cells transformed with empty vector (Fig. 2). Therefore, ZnG UvrA does not exert a dominant negative affect on endogenous E. coli UvrA.FIGURE 2UV survival of E. coli WP2 strains. WP2 (trp-, uvrA-) cells were transformed with pT7pol26, a plasmid encoding an IPTG-inducible T7 polymerase, and pTYB1 or pTYB1-Wt UvrA or pTYB1-ZnG UvrA. In addition, WP2 (trp-) cells with endogenous UvrA were transformed with pT7pol26 and pTYB1 or pTYB1-ZnG UvrA. After individual colonies were selected and grown to an A600 of ∼1.0, the cell culture was diluted 2-fold, and the proteins were induced by addition of IPTG (0.1 mm) for 1 h at 3"
https://openalex.org/W2024859394,"Activation of the MAPK pathway mediates insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-dependent proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). Our previous studies have shown that IGF-I-induced Shc phosphorylation is necessary for sustained activation of MAPK and increased cell proliferation of SMCs, and both Shc and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 must be recruited to the membrane protein SHPS-1 in order for Shc to be phosphorylated. These studies were undertaken to determine whether Src kinase activity is required to phosphorylate Shc in response to IGF-I in SMC and because SHP-2 binds to Src whether their interaction was also required for IGF-I-stimulated mitogenesis. Our results show that IGF-I induces activation of Src kinase and that is required for Shc phosphorylation and for optimal MAPK activation. We tested whether Shc is a substrate of c-Src in SMC by disrupting Src/Shc association using a peptide containing a YXXL (Tyr328) motif sequence derived from Src. The peptide blocked the binding of Src and Shc in vitro and in vivo. Cells expressing a mutant Src (Src-FF) that had Tyr328/Tyr358 substituted with phenylalanines (Src-FF) showed defective Src/Shc binding, impaired IGF-I-dependent Shc phorylation, and impaired mitogenesis. This supports the conclusion that Src phosphorylates Shc. IGF-I induced both Src/SHP-2 and Src/SHPS-1 association. SMCs expressing an SHP-2 mutant that had the polyproline-rich region of SH2 deleted (SHP-2Δ10) had disrupted SHP-2/Src association, impaired IGF-I-dependent Shc phosphorylation, and an attenuated mitogenic response. IGF-I-induced association of Src and SHPS-1 was also impaired in SHP-2Δ10-expressing cells, although SHP-2/SHPS-1 association was unaffected. Upon IGF-I stimulation, a complex assembles on SHPS-1 that contains SHP-2, c-Src, and Shc wherein Src phosphorylates Shc, a signaling step that is necessary for an optimal mitogenic response. Activation of the MAPK pathway mediates insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-dependent proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). Our previous studies have shown that IGF-I-induced Shc phosphorylation is necessary for sustained activation of MAPK and increased cell proliferation of SMCs, and both Shc and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 must be recruited to the membrane protein SHPS-1 in order for Shc to be phosphorylated. These studies were undertaken to determine whether Src kinase activity is required to phosphorylate Shc in response to IGF-I in SMC and because SHP-2 binds to Src whether their interaction was also required for IGF-I-stimulated mitogenesis. Our results show that IGF-I induces activation of Src kinase and that is required for Shc phosphorylation and for optimal MAPK activation. We tested whether Shc is a substrate of c-Src in SMC by disrupting Src/Shc association using a peptide containing a YXXL (Tyr328) motif sequence derived from Src. The peptide blocked the binding of Src and Shc in vitro and in vivo. Cells expressing a mutant Src (Src-FF) that had Tyr328/Tyr358 substituted with phenylalanines (Src-FF) showed defective Src/Shc binding, impaired IGF-I-dependent Shc phorylation, and impaired mitogenesis. This supports the conclusion that Src phosphorylates Shc. IGF-I induced both Src/SHP-2 and Src/SHPS-1 association. SMCs expressing an SHP-2 mutant that had the polyproline-rich region of SH2 deleted (SHP-2Δ10) had disrupted SHP-2/Src association, impaired IGF-I-dependent Shc phosphorylation, and an attenuated mitogenic response. IGF-I-induced association of Src and SHPS-1 was also impaired in SHP-2Δ10-expressing cells, although SHP-2/SHPS-1 association was unaffected. Upon IGF-I stimulation, a complex assembles on SHPS-1 that contains SHP-2, c-Src, and Shc wherein Src phosphorylates Shc, a signaling step that is necessary for an optimal mitogenic response.

Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4228-4235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the MAPK pathway is required for IGF-I-dependent proliferation, whereas activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway is the predominant determinant of IGF-I-dependent SMC migration. Binding of IGF-I to the IGF-I receptor leads to receptor autophosphorylation followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates such as IRS-1 and Shc (2LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). These adaptor proteins bind Grb2/SOS and activate the Ras/MAPK pathway (3Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Previous studies in SMC have shown that IGF-I-induced Shc phosphorylation and its association with Grb-2 are necessary for sustained phosphorylation of Erk1/2 MAPK and IGF-I-dependent cell proliferation (4Ling Y. Maile L.A. Lieskovska J. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement of Shc phosphorylation for growth factor-dependent mitogenesis has been demonstrated in other cell types as well (5Kim B. Cheng H.L. Margolis B. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34543-34550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6Sasaoka T. Ishiki M. Wada T. Hori H. Hirai H. Haruta T. Ishihara H. Kobayashi M. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5226-5235Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Src family kinases (SFK) have been implicated in mediating the mitogenic effect of several growth factors (7Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 8Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism by which SFK function is not completely understood. Src has also been implicated in IGF-I action. The requirement of Src kinase activity for IGF-I-dependent MAP kinase activation has been demonstrated in 3T3 preadipocytes (9Boney C.M. Sekimoto H. Gruppuso P.A. Frackelton Jr., A.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 379-386PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that the IGF-I receptor is a substrate for v-Src (10Peterson J.E. Kulik G. Jelinek T. Reuter C.W. Shannon J.A. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31562-31571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Src activation stimulates IGF-I-dependent proliferation in pancreatic carcinoma cells by increasing the number of IGF-I receptors (11Flossmann-Kast B.B. Jehle P.M. Hoeflich A. Adler G. Lutz M.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3551-3554PubMed Google Scholar). c-Src consists of several domains as follows: N-terminal Src homology (SH) 4 domain containing a myristoylation and membrane localization signal, followed by a unique domain and then SH3 and SH2 domains, the catalytic SH1 domain, and the C-terminal tail. An important mechanism of c-Src regulation is the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of two critical tyrosine residues. c-Src is positively regulated by activation loop autophosphorylation (Tyr416 in mammalian Src), which occurs following SH2 and SH3 domain-mediated interactions. Src activity is negatively controlled by C-terminal tyrosyl phosphorylation (Tyr529 in mammalian Src), which creates a binding site for the SH2 domain of c-Src, locking the molecule in an inactive state (8Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Another important factor that determines Src function is its differential subcellular localization. When present at plasma membrane, Src is thought to be involved in signal transduction events regulating cell growth and proliferation via activated growth factor receptors (8Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar).SHP-2, an Src homology containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase, plays an important role in mediating growth factor-dependent mitogenic signaling (12Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Intact phosphatase activity of SHP-2 and its proper recruitment to other signaling molecules are necessary for full activation of the MAPK pathway following stimulation by epidermal growth factor and insulin (13Shi Z.Q. Yu D.H. Park M. Marshall M. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1526-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 14Cai T. Nishida K. Hirano T. Khavari P.A. J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). SHP-2 has also been implicated in the regulation of c-Src tyrosine kinase activity by distinct mechanisms that are both dependent and independent of its tyrosine phosphatase activity (16Walter A.O. Peng Z.Y. Cartwright C.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1911-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17Zhang S.Q. Yang W. Kontaridis M.I. Bivona T.G. Wen G. Araki T. Luo J. Thompson J.A. Schraven B.L. Philips M.R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 341-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Our prior studies have shown that SHP-2 transfer to the plasma membrane via activation of αVβ3 is required for IGF-I to initiate sustained MAPK activation and optimal mitogenic signaling (18Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4259-4264Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the β3 subunit of αVβ3 is stimulated by ligand occupancy, and this results in recruitment of SHP-2 (19Ling Y. Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1824-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Following its recruitment to αVβ3, SHP-2 is transferred to the transmembrane protein SHPS-1 in response to IGF-I. This transfer requires the phosphorylation of at least two tyrosines contained within the SHPS-1 cytoplasmic domain. IGF-I stimulates phosphorylation of these tyrosines that results in recruitment of SHP-2 to SHPS-1 and blocking SHP-2 transfer inhibits IGF-I-stimulated mitogenic signaling (20Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8955-8960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that Shc association with SHPS-1 is necessary for Shc phosphorylation in response to IGF-I and that Shc/SHPS-1 association is dependent on SHP-2 recruitment to SHPS-1 (4Ling Y. Maile L.A. Lieskovska J. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This requirement of SHP-2 recruitment to SHPS-1 suggests that it could mediate the localization of signaling components (e.g. a kinase) that are necessary for Shc phosphorylation and subsequently MAPK activation. These studies were undertaken to determine the role of Src kinase in IGF-I-induced Shc activation and whether SHP-2 plays a role in mediating Src transfer.MATERIALS AND METHODSHuman IGF-I was a gift from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Immobilon-P membranes were purchased from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). DMEM containing 4500 mg of glucose/liter (DMEM-H) was purchased from Invitrogen. Streptomycin and penicillin were purchased from Invitrogen. The Src family kinase inhibitor, SU6656, was purchased from Calbiochem. Two different anti-Src antibodies (i.e. Ab327 and Src-B12) were used in this study. Ab327 was the kind gift from J. S. Brugge. Src-B12 and anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The polyclonal antibody anti-Src (Tyr(P)418) recognizing activated Src was from BIOSOURCE. To detect SHP-2 protein, we used a polyclonal serum prepared in our laboratory. Three peptides containing the sequences between amino acid positions 367–368, 486–505, and 569–591 from human SHP-2 were synthesized by the University of North Carolina Peptide Synthesis Facility. They were purified and then linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used for immunization of a rabbit as described previously (21Camacho-Hubner C. Busby Jr., W.H. McCusker R.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hemagglutinin epitope (HA) polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-phospho-Erk1/2 (p44/p42 MAPK) antibody and anti-β-actin antibody were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal anti-Erk1/2 and monoclonal and polyclonal anti-Shc antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories. The plasmids, pcDNA3.1 containing mouse wild type Src cDNA or catalytically inactive Src (K295R), were kindly provided by J. S. Brugge. Three synthetic peptides were prepared that contained the TAT sequence that confers cell permeability (22Ho A. Schwarze S.R. Mermelstein S.J. Waksman G. Dowdy S.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 474-477PubMed Google Scholar) followed by either the proline-rich region of the SHP-2 sequence (underline indicates positions 558–570) YARAAARQARASPLPPCTPTPPCA or the sequence homologous to Src that contains Tyr328 (underline indicates positions 325–334) YARAAARQARAVQLYAVVSEE, or sequence from the N-terminal region of p52 Shc (underline indicates positions 29–39) YARAAARQARASFVNKPTRGWL, respectively. The peptides were synthesized by the Protein Chemistry Core Facility, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Purity and sequence confirmation were determined by mass spectrometry.Cell Culture—pSMCs were prepared from porcine aortas as described previously (23Parker A. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2470-2476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in DMEM-H with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), streptomycin (100 ng/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). The smooth muscle cells that were used in these experiments were between passages 4 and 16.Generation of pLenti Expression Vectors pLenti-Src-WT, pLenti-SrcK295R, and pLenti-Src-FF Mutants—The mouse cDNAs encoding the wild type (WT) Src and the kinase-dead Src (K295R) were kindly provided by Dr. J. S. Brugge. The kinase-dead Src (K295R) has a substitution for lysine 295, which is the ATP-binding site within the catalytic domain of Src kinase (24Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Zhou X.M. Foster D. Brugge J.S. Sukhatme V.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Both c-Src cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the following forward and reverse primers, respectively: 5′-CACCATGGGCAGCAACAAGAGCAAGCCC-3′ and 5′-TTAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTATAGGTTCTCCCCGGGCTGGTAC-3′. The reverse primer contains a sequence encoding the HA epitope (underlined). The PCR products were cloned into the pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen). The complete sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. To generate the Src-FF mutant, the tyrosines at positions 328 and 358 (potential binding sites for SH2 domains) were substituted with phenylalanines using double-stranded mutagenesis. The PCR product bearing the wild type Src cDNA sequence was cloned into the pEntr/D-TOPO Gateway entry vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The following forward and reverse oligonucleotides were used to generate PCR product (“megaprimer”), respectively, 5′-TGCAGCTGTTTGCTGTGGTGTCGGA-3′ and 5′-TAGCCGCAAAAATTTGCCCGTTTCCC-3′, and the underlined bases indicate the substitutions that change Tyr to Phe. The PCR product was then used as a primer for double-stranded mutagenesis, and the product was cloned into pEntr/D-TOPO. The Src-Y328F/Y358F sequence was excised from pEntr/D-TOPO cell ligated into pLentiCMV Gateway according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The complete sequence was verified by DNA sequencing.pLenti-SHP-2/WT and pLenti-SHP-2Δ10 Mutant—The human cDNA for wild type SHP-2 was derived from a human fibroblast cell line GM10 (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ) (20Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8955-8960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Full-length SHP-2 was PCR-amplified using the following forward and reverse primers, respectively, 5′-CACCATGACATCGCGGAGATGGTTTCACCC-3′ and 5′-TTAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTATCTGAAACTTTTCTGCTGTTGCATCAG-3′. The reverse primer contains the sequence encoding the HA epitope (underlined). The PCR product was cloned into the pEntr/D-TOPO Gateway entry vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). To generate the SHP-2Δ10 mutant the amino acids 559PLPPCTPTPP568 were deleted from SHP-2 by double-stranded mutagenesis of pEntr/SHP-2. The complementary oligonucleotides (100 ng) were annealed to 50 ng of supercoiled plasmid and extended by linear PCR amplification using Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen). The following forward and reverse oligonucleotides were used: 5′-AGACGAGTGGAGATCAGAGCTGTGCAGAAATGAGAGAAGACA-3′ and 5′-TGTCTTCTCTCATTTCTGCACAGCTCTGATCTCCACTCGTCT-3′; the underlined bases indicate the deletion border. The resulting plasmids were digested using DpnI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 1 h 37 °C and transformed into TOP10 competent cells (Invitrogen). Deletion of amino acids 559–568 was confirmed by sequencing (University of North Carolina Genome Analysis Facility, Chapel Hill). Both the SHP-2/WT and SHP-2Δ10 sequences were then excised from pEntr/D-TOPO and ligated into pLentiCMV Gateway using the LR clonase reaction according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen).pLenti-U6 siRNA-Src Silencing c-Src Gene Expression—The siRNA plasmids were generated using BLOCK-iT U6 RNAi system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two target sequences from the c-src gene sequence were chosen: (bp 47–63) 5′-GCAACAAGAGCAAGCCC-3′ and (bp 200–220) 5′-AAGCTGTTTGGTGGCTTCAAC-3′. These sequences were shown previously to effectively silence src gene expression (25Summy J.M. Trevino J.G. Baker C.H. Gallick G.E. Pancreas. 2005; 31: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Two single-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to each sequence (forward, 5′-CACCGCAACAAGAGCAAGCCCAACGAATTGGGCTTGCTCTTGTTGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-AAAAGCAACAAGAGCAAGCCCAATTCGTTGGGCTTGCTCTTGTTGC-3′, for bp 8–22, and forward, 5′-CACCGAAGCTGTTTGGTGGCTTCAACAACGGTTGAAGCCACCAAACAGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-AAAAGCTGTTTGGTGGCTTCAACCGTTGTTGAAGCCACCAAACAGCTTC-3′, for bp 200–220) were obtained and annealed to generate a double-stranded oligonucleotide that was cloned into the pENTR/U6 vector. Constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and then excised from pEntr/U6 and ligated into pLentiU6 Gateway using the LR clonase reaction according manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen).siRNA-Src cells were generated as described below except that two different viral stocks were combined when transducing SMC (one corresponding to pLentiU6 Src bp 8–22 and the another corresponding to pLentiU6 bp 200–220).Generation of Virus Stocks—293FT cells (Invitrogen) were prepared for generation of virus stocks of each individual pLenti-construct. Cells were plated at 5 × 106 per 75-cm2 flask (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) the day before transfection in the growth medium (DMEM-H with 10% fetal bovine serum with streptomycin at 100 ng/ml and penicillin at 100 units/ml). On the day of transfection, the culture medium was replaced with 5 ml of Opti-MEM-I (Invitrogen) without antibiotics or serum. The DNA-Lipofectamine™ 2000 complexes for each transfection were prepared and added along with total 8 ml of Opti-MEM-I medium according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The next day the medium containing the DNA-Lipofectamine™ 2000 complexes was removed and replaced with 12 ml of growth medium. The virus-containing supernatants were harvested 48 h post-transfection, filtered through a 0.2-μm filter, and stored as 1-ml aliquots at –80 °C.Establishment of SMCs Expressing pLenti Constructs—pSMCs (passage 4–5) were seeded at 3 × 105/well in 6-well plates the day before transduction. The viral stocks were thawed, and the viral complexes were precipitated as follows. For each 1 ml of virus stock, 1 μl of an 80 mg/ml solution of chondroitin sulfate (C4384, Sigma) was added and then mixed gently and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. 1 μl of 80 mg/ml Polybrene (Sigma, H9286) was subsequently added and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min to pellet the virus, and the supernatant was removed. For transduction, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of growth medium, and 1 μl of Polybrene (40 mg/ml) was added. The mixture was then incubated with the cells for 24 h. The virus-containing medium was removed and changed to 2 ml of growth medium for another 24 h and then replaced with selection medium (growth medium containing 4 μg/ml blasticidin; Invitrogen). The cultures were grown until they reached confluent density. The expression of the HA-tagged Src or SHP-2 proteins was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody (1:1000) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells per 10-cm plate (BD Biosciences) and grown for 7 days to reach confluency. The cultures were incubated in serum-free DMEM-H for 16–20 h prior to the addition of IGF-I (100 ng/ml). In experiments in which the Src family kinase inhibitor, SU6656, was used, it was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and added to confluent cultures for 1 h at a final concentration 3 μm. Control cultures were exposed to Me2SO alone. For the experiments in which the cell-permeable peptides were added, 10 μg/ml of each peptide was added directly to the serum-free medium for 1 h prior to adding IGF-I. The cell monolayers were lysed in a modified RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) in the presence of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and phosphatase inhibitors (25 mm sodium fluoride and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were exposed to a 1:330 dilution of anti-Src, anti-SHP-2, or anti-SHC antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were immobilized using protein-A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4°C and washed three times with the same buffer. The precipitated proteins were eluted in 40 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated using either 7.5 or 8% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, which were blocked for 1 h in Tris/saline buffer containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin. The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies (1:500 for SHP-2 or 1:1000 for antibodies against Src, activated Src-Tyr(P)418, Shc, or Tyr(P)). To detect phosphorylation of Erk1/2 MAPK, 30 μl of cell lysate was removed prior to immunoprecipitation and mixed with 30 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and then separated by SDS-PAGE using an 8% gel. Anti-phospho-Erk1/2 MAPK antibody (1:1000) was used to detect activated MAPK. The total amount of Erk protein was detected using a monoclonal anti-Erk1/2 antibody at a dilution of 1:1000. The proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce), and their abundance was analyzed using the GeneGenome CCD image system (Syngene, Ltd., Cambridge, UK). The images obtained were also scanned using an Agfa scanner. Densitometric analyses of the images were undertaken using NIH Image, version 1.61. All experiments were conducted at least three times unless stated otherwise.Src Kinase Assay—In vitro Src kinase activity was determined by Src assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, Src protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-Src antibody (M327 Ab). The Src-specific peptide (KVEKIGEGTYGWYK) was used as a substrate in the assay, and its phosphorylation was measured. Phosphorylation of peptide reflects the activity of Src kinase.Cell Proliferation Assay—Assessment of SMC proliferation was performed as described previously (26Nam T.J. Busby Jr., W.H. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1100-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells expressing wild type or mutated proteins were incubated with or without IGF-I (50 ng/ml) for 48 h, and the cell number in each well was counted. Each group was analyzed in triplicate within a single experiment, and the results represent mean values of the three independent experiments.Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used to compare the differences between control and treatment groups or control cells and cells expressing mutant proteins. p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSIGF-I Induces Src Activation in pSMC—To examine whether IGF-I could induce activation of c-Src tyrosine kinase in pSMC, we analyzed c-Src immunoprecipitates following IGF-I stimulation by Western blotting using an antibody that detects activated c-Src-Tyr(P)416. Src tyrosine phosphorylation was minimally detectable without IGF-I stimulation, and upon stimulation it increased 2.4-fold at 1 min and then returned to base line by 5 min (Fig. 1A) (2.4 ± 1.1 (mean ± S.D.)-fold increase at 1 min, p < 0.05; 1.4 ± 0.3-fold increase at 2 min, n = 3, p < 0.05). To confirm that phosphorylation of Tyr416 accurately reflects the Src kinase activity, we tested the Src immunoprecipitates in Src kinase assay in vitro using a synthetic peptide that is known to be an Src substrate. IGF-I induced transient increase in Src activity at 1 min which decreased to the basal level after 5 min (Fig. 1B). Thus, the phosphorylation of Src Tyr416 in SMC correlates with Src activity measured by the in vitro kinase assay.To determine whether SFKs play a role in IGF-I-mediated MAPK activation, we examined MAPK (e.g. Erk1/2) activation by IGF-I in the presence or absence of the Src family kinase inhibitor SU-6656. This inhibitor has been shown to be specific for SFK (27Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). pSMC were incubated with 3 μm of SU-6656 for 1 h and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml IGF-I for the indicated times. IGF-I-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation was inhibited in the presence of SU-6656 at all time points when compared with control samples (e.g. 79 ± 2% decrease at 10 min, n = 3, p < 0.05, and 30 ± 3% decrease at 20 min) (Fig. 1C). This result suggests that SFK activity is required for optimal MAPK activation by IGF-I. To show that Src kinase activity was inhibited, Src activity was analyzed in the presence or absence of SU-6656. As shown in Fig. 1D, SU-6656 efficiently inhibited Src activity. (The 2.27 ± 0.83-fold increase was reduced to a 1.09 ± 0.14-fold increase at 1 min, p < 0.05, n = 3). Src activity was also inhibited by SU6656 when assessed in the in vitro kinase assay (data not shown).Dominant-negative Src Inhibits IGF-I-stimulated Mitogenic Signaling in pSMC—To further confirm that c-Src activation was required for optimal IGF-I-stimulated MAPK activation, we generated pSMC-expressing wild type c-Src (Src-WT) or catalytically inactive c-Src (Src-K295R). This substitution of lysine 295 with arginine causes inactivation of the ATP-binding site within the c-Src catalytic domain. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, Src-WT cells and Src-K295R cells expressed comparable levels of HA-tagged c-Src protein as measured by Western blotting. To confirm that Src-K295R functioned in a dominant-negative manner, we analyzed IGF-induced c-Src activation. IGF-I stimulated activation of c-Src kinase (Tyr416 phosphorylation) in Src-WT-expressing cells but failed to do so in cells expressing the kinase-dead Src-K295R mutant (Fig. 2B). To determine the consequences of expression of the kinase-dead form of c-Src on IGF-I-mediated MAPK activation, we analyzed Erk1/2 activation in Src-WT and Src-K295R cells. As shown in Fig. 2C the amount of IGF-I-induced Erk1/2 activation was significantly reduced in cells expressing the mutant form of c-Src compared with Src-WT-expressing cells (at 10 min 60 ± 2% decrease in Src-K295R cells, n = 3, p < 0.05). We also measured cell proliferation in cells expressing either c-Src-WT or c-Src-K295R after IGF-I stimulation. IGF-I stimulated a 1.84 ± 0.07-fold increase in proliferation in control, c-Src-WT-expressing cells but failed to stimulate an increase in c-Src-K295R-expressing cells (1.13 ± 0.27-fold increase; n = 6, p < 0.05; see Fig. 2D).

Recent evidence indicates that LAT1-4F2hc, which transports bulky hydrophobic amino acids, may play a crucial role in carcinogenesis both in cellular growth and survival signaling, thereby making it potential target for cancer therapy (for review, see Ref. 18Fuchs B.C. Bode B.P. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2005; 15: 254-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Moreover, 4F2hc is an integrin-associated protein that mediates integrin-dependent signals, which promote tumorigenesis (19Feral C.C. Nishiya N. Fenczik C.A. Stuhlmann H. Slepak M. Ginsberg M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Despite the important roles attributed to HAT, few studies have addressed the structure-function relationship of these transporters; (i) most HAT are obligate antiporters with a 1:1 stoichiometry (20Chillaron J. Roca R. Valencia A. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: 995-1018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) light subunits appear to be necessary and sufficient for transport activity, as demonstrated for b0,+AT (21Reig N. Chillaron J.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4906-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar); (iii) in using xCT as a model for the light subunits, we showed a membrane topology with 12 transmembrane domains and revealed that the residues His-110 and Cys-327 are crucial for function (3Gasol E.

In non-reducing SDS-PAGE conditions 4F2hc-associated heterodimers run mainly as a 125-kDa band (23Rossier G. Meier C. Bauch C. Summa V. Sordat B. Verrey F. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34948-34954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), whereas rBAT and b0,+AT run as a band of 130 kDa (the disulfide-linked b0,+AT-rBAT) and an additional band of 250 kDa (4Fernandez E. Carrascal M. Rousaud F. Abian J. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Chillaron J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, neither the native structure nor the functional unit of the HAT is known. Here we present evidence indicating that the single heterodimer is the functional unit of systems b0,+ and x -C. 4F2hc-associated heterodimers seem not to form stable oligomers, whereas b0,+AT-rBAT is a heterotetramer in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that rBAT promotes the oligomerization of HAT. The construction of the distinct cDNAs is described under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Reagents and Antibodies—Reagents were obtained from Sigma if not indicated otherwise.

The rabbit polyclonal antibody against mouse LAT2 was produced at Research Genetics. The antigenic peptide was PIFKPTPVKDPDSEEQP (the C-terminal 17 residues). Specificity of this antibody was tested by comparing the signal in Western blot with the preimmune antisera obtained from the same rabbit (data not shown). cRNA Synthesis, Injection, and Maintenance of Xenopus Oocytes—The synthesis of human 4F2hc cRNA has been described elsewhere (26Estevez R.

In vitro synthesis of human xCT wild type, xCT C327S, and xCT concatamers was conducted with the NotI-linearized plasmid template using the in vitro transcription protocol from AMBION (mMESSAGE mMACHINE, Ambion, Austin, TX). Mixtures of cRNAs were prepared immediately before injection with a calibrated pipette. The amount of transcribed RNA was calculated by 260-nm absorbance measurement before microinjection into Xenopus oocytes. Each of the cRNA species was synthesized at least on two occasions. In mixing experiments, oocytes were injected with 4F2hc cRNA (5 ng) together with xCT Wt (5 ng), xCT C327S (5 ng), or with a mixture of xCT Wt and xCT C327S (total amount of 5 ng of xCT cRNAs). For the concatamers, 25 ng of the corresponding cRNA together with 5 ng of 4F2hc cRNA were injected per oocyte. The procedures for injection and maintenance of oocytes have been described in detail elsewhere (27Bertran J. Werner A. Moore M.L. Stange G. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5601-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with either 50 nl of water or 50 nl of water containing the cRNAs. Oocytes were incubated in modified Barth's solution, and the experiments were performed 2-4 days after injection. Cell Culture and Transfection—Growth, maintenance, and calcium phosphate transient transfection was performed as described (25Font M.A. Feliubadalo L. Estivill X. Nunes V. Golomb E. Kreiss Y. Pras E.

For fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, the cells were plated on a 6-well plate and transiently transfected using FuGENE-6 (Roche Applied Science). This reagent (6 μl) was added to serum-free medium (100 μl) at room temperature for 5 min. This medium was incubated with plasmids encoding the CFP and YFP fusion proteins (1 μg each) for 30 min, and the mixture was added to the cells grown in culture medium. After 6 h of incubation, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and reseeded on a 6-well plate containing one coverslip (22 mm, Electron Microscopy Science) per well. Transport Assays and Transport Reconstitution—Influx rates of 100 μm l-[3H]glutamate (ARC) or 20 μm l-[35S]cystine (Amersham Biosciences) in Xenopus oocytes or transfected HeLa cells were performed as described (22Jimenez-Vidal M.

Reconstitution of wild type b0,+AT and the C321S mutant into liposomes and uptake measurements in the reconstituted system were performed as described (21Reig N. Chillaron J. Bartoccioni P.

Membrane Preparation and Protein Purification by Ni2+-NTA Chromatography—Kidney brush border membranes were obtained as described (4Fernandez E. Carrascal M. Rousaud F. Abian J. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Chillaron J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For the preparation of kidney total membranes, the kidney was homogenized in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 4 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, and 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide with the protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and pepstatin on a CPCU Polytron. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. A similar procedure was used to obtain total membranes from HeLa cells, but the cells (∼107 cells/1 ml homogenization buffer) were homogenized by 15 passages through a 25-gauge needle. For Blue Native PAGE or cross-linking, the membranes were resuspended directly in the appropriate buffers (see below). For Ni2+-NTA chromatography, total membranes from HeLa cells were resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 50 mm NaCl, 1% digitonin (final detergent/protein (w/w) ratio of 3.3), and solubilization proceeded for 30 min. Insoluble material was discarded by a 10,000 × g centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was diluted in the above buffer containing 15 mm imidazole and applied to the Ni2+-NTA beads (Qiagen). After 30 min of end-over-end mixing at room temperature, the beads were washed 4 times in a similar buffer containing 0.1% digitonin and 10 mm imidazole. Elution was performed by raising the imidazole concentration to 100 mm for 10 min at room temperature. The eluted material was then processed for Blue Native PAGE (see below). Blue Native and SDS-PAGE—In preliminary experiments we tested a range of detergent/protein (w/w) ratios with a fixed Coomassie Blue G/detergent ratio (w/w) of 1/2.5 (28Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). With 0.5-1% digitonin extracts and a 3.3/1 detergent/protein ratio, we observed that rBAT and b0,+AT appeared as a single band of 535 ± 18 kDa (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained with 0.25-0.5% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, although a smear appeared above the ∼535-kDa band. N-Octylglucoside did not resolve any band, and Triton-X-100 increased the smearing until no distinct band could be seen (data not shown). We did not observe any additional bands. Digitonin/protein ratios below 3.3/1 increased smearing and decreased the intensity of the ∼535-kDa band, and at a ratio of 0.25/1 no band was detected; ratios up to 10/1 were similar to the 3.3/1 ratio (data not shown). Membranes were solubilized for 30 min at room temperature in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 50 mm NaCl, 1% digitonin at a detergent/protein ratio (w/w) of 3.3 (see above). Further treatment with a range of urea concentrations, 100 mm DTT, or 2% SDS with or without 100 mm DTT was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min. After solubilization, Blue Native buffer was added, and Blue Native PAGE was performed as described (29Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar, 30Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Native molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences) were visualized by Coomassie staining. For control SDS-PAGE, SDS sample buffer (without DTT) was added to the solubilized samples, which were immediately loaded (without heating) in SDS-PAGE gels. Western blots were performed as described (31Pineda M. Wagner C.A. Broer A. Stehberger P.A. Kaltenbach S. Gelpi J.L. Martin D.R. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Lang F. Broer S. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After transference of Blue Native gels, the membrane was destained in methanol 50% and acetic acid 10% to eliminate excess Coomassie Blue G (Serva) and washed with bi-distilled water before blocking. Cross-linking—Total membrane proteins from transfected HeLa cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 2 mg/ml with the cross-linker dimethyl suberimidate (DMS, from Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was terminated by the addition of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 15 min at room temperature. FRET—For FRET analysis the concatamers CFP-b0,+AT/rBAT 8The notation LSHAT-HSHAT (i.e.b0,+AT-rBAT) indicates that the light subunit LSHAT and the heavy subunit HSHAT are disulfide-linked and expressed from distinct genes/vectors; the notation LSHAT/HSHAT (i.e. b0,+AT/rBAT) indicates that the two subunits are linked as a fusion protein (concatamer). and YFP-b0,+AT/rBAT, CFP-xCT/4F2hc and YFP-xCT/4F2hc, and the CFP-EGFR and YFP-EGFR fusion proteins were transiently expressed in HeLa cells. A Leica TCS SL laser scanning confocal spectral microscope (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH, Manheim, Germany) equipped with an argon laser, 63× oil immersion objective lens and a double dichroic filter (458/514 nm) was used. We used CFP as the donor fluorochrome paired with YFP as the acceptor fluorochrome. FRET measurements were based on the sensitized emission method previously described (32Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 33Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) with minor modifications for the confocal microscope. In some experiments in which the sensitized emission method was performed, FRET efficiency was also calculated using the acceptor photobleaching method (34Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13963-13971Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 35Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The same set of transfected cells (but distinct dishes) was used for both methods. Sensitized Emission Method—The sensitized emission method is based on the increase of acceptor fluorescence caused by FRET during excitation. To measure FRET, three images were acquired in the same order in all experiments through 1) the CFP channel (absorbance 458 nm, emission 465-510 nm), 2) the FRET channel (absorbance 458 nm, emission 525-600 nm) 3) the YFP channel (absorbance 514 nm, emission 525-600 nm). Background was subtracted from images before performing FRET calculations. Control and experiment images were taken under the same conditions of photomultiplier gain, offset, and pinhole aperture. The FRET image must be corrected for the cross-talk of the donor emission and the direct excitation of the acceptor by the donor excitation wavelength. The crossover of the donor and acceptor fluorescence through the FRET filter is a constant proportion between the fluorescence intensity levels of donor and acceptor and their bleed-through. To correct for this spectral bleed-through of the donor and acceptor through the FRET filter, images of cells expressing only CFP-b0,+AT/rBAT, CFP-xCT/4F2hc, or CFP-EGFR and cells expressing only YFP-b0,+AT/rBAT, YFP-xCT/4F2hc, or YFP-EGFR were also taken under the same conditions as for the experiments. Corrected FRET was calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis for the entire image by using equation,FRETC=FRET-(A×CFP)-(B×YFP) where FRET, CFP, and YFP correspond to background-subtracted images of cells expressing CFP and YFP acquired through the FRET, CFP, and YFP channels, respectively. A (equal to 0.20) and B (equal to 0.21) correspond to the cross-talk coefficient of CFP and YFP through the FRET filter set, respectively. Images of FRETC intensity were renormalized using a look-up table in which the minimum and maximum values are displayed as blue and red, respectively. Mean FRETC values were calculated from mean fluorescence intensities for each selected region of interest following Equation 1, and normalized sensitized FRET (FRETN) values for selected sub-regions of the image were calculated on the basis of the equation,FRETN=FRETC/(YFP×CFP) where FRETC, CFP, and YFP are the mean intensities of FRETC, CFP, and YFP fluorescence in the selected sub-region of the image. The negative FRETC values obtained in some experiments are due to slight over-estimation of the spectral bleed-through coefficients. Areas with unusually high or low CFP/YFP ratios (i.e. outside the 1:1 to 1:4 stoichiometric range) were excluded from analysis. All calculations were performed using the Image Processing Leica Confocal Software and Microsoft Excel. Acceptor Photobleaching Method—In the presence of FRET, bleaching of the acceptor (YFP) results in a significant increase in fluorescence of the donor (CFP). Half the cell was bleached in the YFP channel using the 514 argon laser line at 100% intensity. Before and after YFP bleaching, CFP and YFP images were collected to assess changes in donor and acceptor fluorescence. To minimize the effect of photobleaching caused by imaging, images were collected at low laser intensity. The gain of the photomultiplier tubes was adjusted to obtain the best possible dynamic range. FRET efficiency was calculated as,E=(Ipost-Ipre)×100/Ipost where Ipre is the pre-bleach CFP intensity, and Ipost is the post-bleach CFP intensity in the bleached region. As an internal negative control, an unbleached region in the same cell was measured. In Vitro Analysis of the Quaternary Structure of HAT—To analyze oligomerization of HAT, we used Blue Native PAGE (29Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar, 30Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar) followed by Western blot. We initially tested different detergents, detergent to protein ratios, and Coomassie Blue G to detergent ratios to find good experimental conditions for detection of the transporters (see “Experimental Procedures” and Refs. 29Schagger H. von Jagow G.

Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). rBAT and b0,+AT were found as a single band of 535 ± 18 kDa (n = 12) (Fig. 1A). This band did not correspond to isolated rBAT or b0,+AT subunits because (i) it was detected in brush border membranes, where only the disulfide-linked heterodimer is found (Fig. 1A, lanes 1) and (ii) a functional, purified, His-tagged b0,+AT/rBAT concatamer (36Pfeiffer R. Loffing J. Rossier G. Bauch C. Meier C. Eggermann T. Loffing-Cueni D. Kuhn L.C. Verrey F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4135-4147Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) (where “/” indicates fusion of the two subunits) had the same mobility (Fig. 1A, lanes 4). As expected, no b0,+AT appeared in membranes from the b0,+AT KO mice (37Feliubadalo L. Arbones M.L. Manas S. Chillaron J. Visa J. Rodes M. Rousaud F. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Nunes V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2097-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, αb0,+AT panel, lane 2). In contrast, rBAT was still detected as the 535-kDa band because of its binding to an as yet unidentified light subunit (4Fernandez E. Carrascal M. Rousaud F. Abian J. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Chillaron J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 37Feliubadalo L. Arbones M.L. Manas S. Chillaron J. Visa J. Rodes M. Rousaud F. Zorzano A.

Blue Native PAGE allows the determination of oligomerization stoichiometry with agents that partially dissociate complexes (28Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E.

Up to 5 m urea did not alter the mobility of the b0,+AT-rBAT complex (data not shown). In contrast, 2% SDS partially dissociated the complex in bands I and II, both in HeLa cells (Figs. 1, B and C) and in brush border membranes (data not shown). The relative amounts of the two bands varied slightly between experiments, but b0,+AT-rBAT never shifted completely to band II. The slower mobility of band I compared with the untreated sample could be due to partial unfolding of b0,+AT-rBAT. On the b0,+AT/rBAT concatamer, DTT may cause further unfolding that results in even a slower mobility of bands I and II (Fig. 1C). The addition of the reducing agent DTT in the presence of SDS dissociated the complex into its subunits (Fig. 1B). rBAT appeared as a single band of 162 ± 11 kDa, and b0,+AT appeared as two bands of 180 ± 14 and 84 ± 9 kDa (n = 7). SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot confirmed that DTT completely reduced the samples (data not shown). No dissociated subunits appeared with the b0,+AT/rBAT concatamer (Fig. 1C).

https://openalex.org/W1999801975,"Superantigens are bacterial or viral proteins that elicit massive T cell activation through simultaneous binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and T cell receptors. This activation results in uncontrolled release of inflammatory cytokines, causing toxic shock. A remarkable property of superantigens, which distinguishes them from T cell receptors, is their ability to interact with multiple MHC class II alleles independently of MHC-bound peptide. Previous crystallographic studies have shown that staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens belonging to the zinc family bind to a high affinity site on the class II β-chain. However, the basis for promiscuous MHC recognition by zinc-dependent superantigens is not obvious, because the β-chain is polymorphic and the MHC-bound peptide forms part of the binding interface. To understand how zinc-dependent superantigens recognize MHC, we determined the crystal structure, at 2.0Å resolution, of staphylococcal enterotoxin I bound to the human class II molecule HLA-DR1 bearing a peptide from influenza hemagglutinin. Interactions between the superantigen and DR1 β-chain are mediated by a zinc ion, and 22% of the buried surface of peptide·MHC is contributed by the peptide. Comparison of the staphylococcal enterotoxin I·peptide·DR1 structure with ones determined previously revealed that zinc-dependent superantigens achieve promiscuous binding to MHC by targeting conservatively substituted residues of the polymorphic β-chain. Additionally, these superantigens circumvent peptide specificity by engaging MHC-bound peptides at their conformationally conserved N-terminal regions while minimizing sequence-specific interactions with peptide residues to enhance cross-reactivity.

Superantigens (SAGs) 4The abbreviations used are: SAG, superantigen; SEI, staphylococcal enterotoxin I; TCR, T cell receptor; TSST-1, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1; SPE, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin; CDR, complementarity-determining region; HA, influenza virus hemagglutinin; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; MBP, myelin basic protein.4The abbreviations used are: SAG, superantigen; SEI, staphylococcal enterotoxin I; TCR, T cell receptor; TSST-1, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1; SPE, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin; CDR, complementarity-determining region; HA, influenza virus hemagglutinin; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; MBP, myelin basic protein. are a class of disease-causing and immunostimulatory proteins of bacterial or viral origin with the ability to activate up to 20% of all T cells, as compared with on the order of only 0.001% of T cells for conventional peptide antigens (hence the term “superantigen”) (1Scherer M.T. Ignatowicz L. Winslow G.M. Kappler J.W. Marrack P. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 101-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 2Li H. Llera A. Malchiodi E.L. Mariuzza R.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 435-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). SAGs activate T cells by simultaneously binding T cell receptors (TCRs) and MHC class II molecules, resulting in the massive release of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1, interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor-α, and tumor necrosis factor-β (1Scherer M.T. Ignatowicz L. Winslow G.M. Kappler J.W. Marrack P. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 101-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). These host cytokines are believed to be responsible for the most severe consequences of SAG intoxication, including capillary leak, renal failure, acute respiratory distress, and death (3McCormick J.K. Yarwood J.M. Schlievert P.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 77-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The best-characterized group of SAGs belongs to the pyrogenic toxin SAG family, which currently numbers 22 members produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (3McCormick J.K. Yarwood J.M. Schlievert P.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 77-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 4Sundberg E.J. Li Y. Mariuzza R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These toxins include staphylococcal enterotoxins A through M (SEA to SEM, except there is no F), staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), streptococcal superantigen (SSA), streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin Z (SMEZ), and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A (SPEA), SPEC, SPEG, SPEH, and SPEJ (5Bohach G.A.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2000: 43-52Google Scholar). These proteins are among the most potent pyrogens known and are capable of inducing toxic shock syndrome, an acute onset illness characterized by high fever and hypotension that can lead to multiple organ failure and lethal shock (3McCormick J.K. Yarwood J.M. Schlievert P.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 77-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Because of their extreme virulence and the ease with which they can be produced and disseminated, bacterial SAGs have been identified as category B agents of bioterrorism by the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 5Bioterrorism Agents/Diseases, U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.5Bioterrorism Agents/Diseases, U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA. All known bacterial SAGs share a characteristic three-dimensional structure consisting of an N-terminalβ-barrel domain and a C-terminal β-grasp domain (2Li H. Llera A. Malchiodi E.L. Mariuzza R.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 435-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Despite this common architecture, the complexes formed between SAGs and MHC molecules are structurally diverse, considerably more so than SAG·TCR complexes (4Sundberg E.J. Li Y. Mariuzza R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) Thus, x-ray crystallographic and binding studies have shown that MHC class II molecules possess two independent binding sites for bacterial SAGs: 1) a low affinity site (KD ∼ 10–5 m) on the conserved α-chain; and 2) a zinc-dependent, high affinity site (KD ∼ 10–7 m) on the polymorphic β-chain. Based on sequence analysis, SAGs may be divided into three groups according to how they bind MHC: 1) those that bind only the MHC α-chain through the low affinity site (SEB, SEC1–3, SEG, TSST-1, SPEA, SSA); 2) those that bind only the MHC β-chain through the zinc-dependent, high affinity site (SEH, SEI, SEJ, SEK, SEL, SEM, SPEC, SPEG, SPEH, SPEJ, SMEZ); and 3) those that cross-link two MHC molecules by simultaneously binding the α-chain of one MHC and the β-chain of another MHC through the low and high affinity sites, respectively (SEA, SED, SEE). A unique feature of bacterial SAGs, which is a major contributor to their toxicity, is the ability of individual SAGs to bind different MHC class II molecules, largely irrespective of the sequence of the MHC-bound peptide. In this way, SAGs maximize TCR-MHC interactions and the resulting T cell activation. For SAGs such as SEB and SEC3, which bind to the low affinity site on the class II α-chain, recognition of multiple MHC alleles by a single toxin is readily explained by crystal structures of these SAGs bound to HLA-DR1, a human class II molecule (10Jardetzky T.S. Brown J.H. Gorga J.C. Stern L.J. Urban R.G. Chi Y.I. Stauffacher C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 11Sundberg E.J. Andersen P.S. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1151-1161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In these complexes, the N-terminal domain of SEB or SEC3 contacts the α1 domain of DR1, away from the peptide-binding groove. Because the DR α-chain is nonpolymorphic and because the SAG does not contact the MHC-bound peptide, the result is promiscuous MHC recognition. By contrast, the structural basis for cross-recognition of MHC by zinc-dependent SAGs is much less apparent, despite the available structures of two such SAGs, SEH and SPEC, bound to HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR2a, respectively (12Petersson K. Hakansson M. Nilsson H. Forsberg G. Svensson L. Lijas A. Walse B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3306-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13Li Y. Li H. Dimassi N. McCormick J.K. Martin R. Schuck P. Schlievert P.M. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In these complexes, the C-terminal domain of the SAG contacts the β1 domain of HLA-DR, which is polymorphic, as well as the MHC-bound peptide. Indeed, the peptide accounts for ∼25% of the surface area of the MHC molecule buried by SEH or SPEC, similar to TCR·peptide·MHC complexes, in which the TCR exhibits exquisite specificity for both peptide and MHC (14Rudolph M.G. Stanfield R.L. Wilson I.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 419-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). To better understand MHC recognition by zinc-dependent SAGs, we determined the crystal structure of staphylococcal enterotoxin I (SEI) bound to HLA-DR1 bearing a peptide from influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA-(306–318)). SEI, which is encoded in the egc operon of S. aureus (15Jarraud S. Peyrat M.A. Lim A. Tristan A. Bes M. Mougel C. Etienne J. Vandenesch F. Bonneville M. Lina G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), is associated with both menstrual and nonmenstrual toxic shock syndrome, in addition to food poisoning (16Banks M.C. Kamel N.S. Zabriskie J.B. Larone D.H. Ursea D. Posnett D.N. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 187: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and various veterinary diseases (17Omoe K. Ishikawa M. Shimoda Y. Hu D.L. Ueda S. Shinagawa K. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2002; 40: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Comparison of the SEI·HA·HLA-DR1 structure with those of SEH and SPEC bound to MHC class II (12Petersson K. Hakansson M. Nilsson H. Forsberg G. Svensson L. Lijas A. Walse B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3306-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13Li Y. Li H. Dimassi N. McCormick J.K. Martin R. Schuck P. Schlievert P.M. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) reveals how zinc-dependent SAGs circumvent peptide specificity and how they target key residues of the polymorphic class II β-chain to achieve promiscuous binding to peptide·MHC. Expression and Purification of SEI—The sei gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (18Fernández M.M. De Marzi M.C. Berguer P. Burzyn D. Langley R.J. Piazzon I. Mariuzza R.A. Malchiodi E.L. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, sei from clinically isolated S. aureus strain Fc30 (AAX84810) was cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI cloning site of the bacterial expression vector pET32a. 3C, which encodes thioredoxin and a 3C protease recognition sequence (19Walker P.A. Leong L.E. Ng P.W. Tan S.H. Waller S. Murphy D. Porter A.G. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) directly upstream of the BamHI site. Six histidine-encoding triplets were grafted onto the 3′ terminus of the sei gene to facilitate purification of the thioredoxin-SEI fusion protein. For expression, transformed Origami (DE3) cells (Novagen) were grown at 30 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Bacteria were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an absorbance of 1.0 at 600 nm. After induction, the cultures were incubated for 4 h with constant shaking. SEI was expressed as a soluble cytoplasmic fusion protein (20Langley R. Wines B. Willoughby N. Basu I. Proft T. Fraser J. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2926-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The protein was purified using a Ni2+ chelate adsorbent (Qiagen), cleaved with 3C protease (kindly provided by Dr. R. Langley) and resubjected to Ni2+ affinity chromatography to separate SEI from thioredoxin. SEI was further purified using a Mono S cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). Expression and Purification of HLA-DR1—HLA-DR1 was produced by in vitro folding from bacterial inclusion bodies as described (21Frayser M. Sato A.K. Xu L. Stern L.J. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmids encoding the HLA-DR1 α-chain (DRA*0101) and β (DRB1*0101) chain were transformed separately into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene). Bacteria were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.6–0.7 at 600 nm, and 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added. Inclusion bodies were washed extensively and the subunits purified under denaturing and reducing conditions using an HQ50 anion exchange column (PerSeptive Biosystems). Yields of DR1 α- and β-subunits were 16 and 20 mg/liter of culture medium, respectively. Purified subunits were diluted dropwise with constant stirring to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml into a folding solution of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 25% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 3 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.3 mm oxidized glutathione and kept at 4 °C for 2 days in the presence of 1 μm HA-(306–318) peptide (PKYVKQNTLKLAT). Recombinant HA·HLA-DR1 was purified from the folding mixture using a Mono Q anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and developed with a linear NaCl gradient. The protein eluted as a single peak at 0.15 m NaCl. Crystallization and Data Collection—HLA-DR1·HA and SEI were premixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, and the complex was purified with a Superdex S-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) prior to crystallization. Crystals were grown at room temperature in hanging drops by mixing 1 μl of protein solution at 10 mg/ml in 10 mm Hepes and 15 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) with 1 μlof reservoir solution containing 10% (v/v) dioxane, 1.2 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5). Large, but twinned, pyramidal crystals grew over a period of 2 weeks. Single crystals were obtained by microseeding at a protein concentration of 7 mg/ml. For data collection, crystals were cryoprotected by brief soaking in mother liquor containing 15% (v/v) glycerol and flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream. X-ray diffraction data to 2.0 Å resolution were recorded in-house at 110 K using an R-axis IV2+ image plate detector equipped with Osmic mirrors and mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode Cu-Kα x-ray generator. The data were processed and scaled with CrystalClear (22Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar).

Only one SEI·HA·HLA-DR1 complex molecule was found in the asymmetric unit, corresponding to a Matthews coefficient of 3.72 (solvent content ∼67%). The molecular replacement solution was refined with Refmac 5.2 (26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar) based on σA-weighted Fo – Fc and 2Fo – Fc electron density maps. TLS parameters were refined as well as temperature (B) factors. The final model comprises residues 4–216 of SEI, 4–181 of DR1-α, 1–190 of DR1-β, and 306–318 of HA and 460 water molecules. The model also contains one zinc ion, four sulfate ions, two dioxane molecules, and one Hepes molecule, resulting in a final Rcryst of 21.3% and Rfree of 25.2% at 2.0 Å resolution. The quality of the model was examined with PROCHECK (28Laskowski R. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) and Molprobity (29Davis I.W. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W615-W619Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Atomic coordinates and structure factors for the SEI·HA·HLA-DR1 complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 2G9H. Overview of the Complex—The structure of SEI bound to HA-(306–318)·HLA-DR1 was determined by molecular replacement to 2.0 Å resolution (Table 1). The overall structure of the complex is shown in Fig. 1A. All residues in the interface between SAG and MHC molecules show unambiguous electron density. In addition, all SEI residues are well defined, including those forming the β4-β5 loop (see below). In the complex, all contacts made by SEI are to the DR1 β-chain and HA peptide; there are no interactions between the DR1 α-chain and the SAG. The β-grasp motif of the C-terminal portion of SEI contacts the α-helix of the β1 domain of HLA-DR1, as well as the N-terminal portion of HA-(306–318) (Fig. 1B). The interaction between SEI and the DR1 β-chain is mediated in part by a zinc ion, for which identity was confirmed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (data not shown). The importance of Zn2+ to complex stabilization is supported by the finding that the addition of EDTA abolishes binding of SEI to HLA-DR1 in solution (18Fernández M.M. De Marzi M.C. Berguer P. Burzyn D. Langley R.J. Piazzon I. Mariuzza R.A. Malchiodi E.L. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the occupancy of Zn2+ in the crystal is surprisingly low. In the final refined model, its occupancy was set to 0.3, which gave a temperature factor of 30.7 Å2, very close to the average main chain atom B-value of 33.6 Å2 for the protein molecules (Table 1). The low zinc occupancy could be explained by traces of EDTA in the protein solution used for crystallization, because EDTA was present throughout the preparation of HLA-DR1 except at the final dialysis stage. Residual EDTA could have stripped Zn2+ from SEI, either before or after crystal formation. Although EDTA eliminates detectable binding of SEI to HLA-DR1 during gel filtration (18Fernández M.M. De Marzi M.C. Berguer P. Burzyn D. Langley R.J. Piazzon I. Mariuzza R.A. Malchiodi E.L. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), it is likely that the SAG retains some affinity for MHC, even in the absence of Zn2+. Under the high protein concentrations in crystallization drops, low affinities often suffice for co-crystallization. Alternatively, even if each complex molecule in the crystal initially contained Zn2+, its partial removal by EDTA would not necessarily disrupt the SEI·HA·DR1 complex, because lattice contacts could compensate for reductions in affinity. Conformation of the β4-β5 Loop and Implications for TCR Binding—In nearly all previously reported SAG structures, both free and bound to MHC or TCR ligands, little or no electron density could be observed for residues connecting β-strands 4 and 5 of the N-terminal domain (10Jardetzky T.S.

In the SEI·HA·DR1 complex, by contrast, the β4-β5 loop of SEI (residues 67–75) is well ordered (Fig. 2A), even though it lacks the disulfide bond typical of other SAGs. Sequence alignments show that this loop is 1–6 residues shorter in SEI than in most SAGs (Fig. 3), which could explain why it adopts a defined conformation in the SEI·HA·DR1 complex (the structure of unbound SEI is unknown). Alternatively, lattice contacts with a neighboring complex molecule in the crystal (which include several hydrogen bonds between loop residues Cys73 and Ser75 and a symmetry-related DR1 molecule) may account for the ordering of the β4-β5 loop in the SEI·HA·DR1 structure.FIGURE 3Structure-based sequence alignment of the zinc family of superantigens.

Thus, the structure of SPEC in complex with human Vβ2.1 showed that the β4-β5 loop makes a substantial contribution to the binding interface (38Sundberg E.J. Li H. Llera A.S. McCormick J.K. Tormo J.

Like SPEC, the five other known zinc-dependent SAGs from Streptococcus (SPEG, SPEH, SPEJ, SMEZ1, and SMEZ2) also stimulate T cells expressing Vβ2.1 (39Proft T. Fraser J.D. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2003; 133: 229-306Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). By contrast, no zinc-dependent SAG from Staphylococcus, including SEI, recognizes Vβ2.1. To help explain the lack of interaction between SEI and Vβ2.1, SEI was superposed onto SPEC in the SPEC·Vβ2.1 structure (38Sundberg E.J. Li H. Llera A.S. McCormick J.K. Tormo J. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 687-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the docked complex (Fig. 2B), major steric clashes are evident between the β4-β5 loop of SEI and the first and second complementarity-determining regions (CDR1 and CDR2) of Vβ2.1. These clashes arise from the very different orientations of the β4-β5 loop in SEI and SPEC, underscoring the importance of this loop in determining Vβ-binding specificity.

Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19664) Google Scholar), of which 596 Å2 is contributed by peptide·MHC and 567 Å2 by the SAG. By comparison, the total buried surfaces in the SEH·HA·DR1 and SPEC·MBP·DR2a complexes are considerably greater: 1465 and 1628 Å2, respectively (12Petersson K. Hakansson M. Nilsson H. Forsberg G.

They use energy from nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis to translocate along one strand of the duplex DNA and displace the complementary strand. Here, the ability of a replicative helicase from each of the three domains, bacteria, archaea, and eukarya, to unwind RNA-containing substrate was determined. It is shown that all three helicases can unwind DNA-RNA hybrids while translocating along the single-stranded DNA. No unwinding could be observed when the helicases were provided with a single-stranded RNA overhang. Using DNA, RNA, and DNA-RNA chimeric oligonucleotides it was found that whereas the enzymes can bind both DNA and RNA, they could translocate only along DNA and only DNA stimulates the ATPase activity of the enzymes. Recent observations suggest that helicases may interact with enzymes participating in RNA metabolism and that RNA-DNA hybrids may be present on the chromosomes. Thus, the results presented here may suggest a new role for the replicative helicases during chromosomal replication or in other cellular processes.

Thus, the results presented here may suggest a new role for the replicative helicases during chromosomal replication or in other cellular processes. Biochemical studies with the replicative helicases of bacteria, archaea, and eukarya suggest that these enzymes form ring-shaped structures that encircle and translocate along DNA while utilizing the energy derived from NTP hydrolysis to separate duplex DNA at the front of the replication fork (1Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The bacterial DnaB helicase is a homohexamer that binds and translocates along single-stranded (ss) 2The abbreviations used are: ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded; ec, E. coli; MCM, minichromosome maintenance; mt, M. thermautotrophicus; sp, S. pombe. and double-stranded (ds) DNA and possesses a 5′→3′ helicase activity and DNA-dependent ATPase activity (2Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd. W.H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). The eukaryotic minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex is a family of six related polypeptides (Mcm2–7), each of which is essential for cell viability. Biochemical studies have shown that a dimeric complex of the Mcm4,6,7 heterotrimer contains 3′→5′ DNA helicase activity, ssDNA binding, and DNA-dependent ATPase activity and is capable of translocating along ss and dsDNA. In vitro, the Mcm2 and Mcm3,5 complexes were shown to inhibit helicase activity (3Lei M. Tye B.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Forsburg S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 109-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Although it has not yet been shown, the MCM complex is thought to function as the eukaryotic replicative helicase. In most archaeal species studied, a single MCM homologue has been identified. The structure of the protein is not yet clear; hexamers, heptamers, dodecamers, and filaments have been reported (5Kelman Z. White M.F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies revealed that the archaeal enzyme possesses an ATP-dependent 3′→5′ helicase activity, DNA-dependent ATPase activity, and can bind and translocate along ss and dsDNA (5Kelman Z. White M.F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 6Kelman L.M. Kelman Z. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic MCM complex was shown to interact with RNA polymerase (7Holland L. Gauthier L. Bell-Rogers P. Yankulov K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5192-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8Yankulov K. Todorov I. Romanowski P. Licatalosi D. Cilli K. McCracken S. Laskey R. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6154-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and was found in a complex with Yph1 (9Du Y.C. Stillman B. Cell. 2002; 109: 835-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), a protein needed for 60 S ribosomal biogenesis that may also participate in polysome translation. Thus it is possible that some replicative helicases participate in cellular processes involving RNA in addition to their role in chromosomal DNA replication. To date, it has not been established whether the MCM complex is capable of translocating and/or unwinding RNA or DNA-RNA hybrids. A study was therefore initiated to determine the ability of replicative helicases from the three domains, bacteria, archaea, and eukarya, to unwind RNA-containing substrates. It is shown here that the Escherichia coli DnaB protein (ecDnaB), the Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus MCM protein (mtMCM), and the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mcm4,6,7 complex (spMCM) cannot unwind duplex RNA substrates. All can, however, unwind a DNA-RNA hybrid substrate when translocating along the ssDNA strand, but not when only overhanging ssRNA was provided. It was also found that although all three enzymes can bind RNA, RNA cannot stimulate the ATPase activity of the enzymes. ATP and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from GE Healthcare, and oligonucleotides and biotinylated oligonucleotides were synthesized by the CARB DNA synthesis facility. Biotin was obtained from Sigma, streptavidin from Rockland Immunochemicals, and nitroavidin (CaptAvidin™) from Molecular Probes. Biotin-dT and 2-o-methyl NTPs were obtained from Glen Research. mtMCM was purified as previously described (10Chen Y.J. Yu X. Kasiviswanathan R. Shin J.H. Kelman Z. Egelman E.H. J. Mol.

Preparation of Substrates for Helicase Assays—Oligonucleotides used for the preparation of the different helicase substrates are listed in supplemental Table S1. The helicase substrates were made as follows. Five pmol of DNA or RNA oligonucleotides (as indicated in the figure legends) were labeled at the 5′-end using 16.7 pmol [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeling reactions were stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm. The labeled oligonucleotide was hybridized to the complementary oligonucleotide(s) at a 1:2 molar ratio in a buffer containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl by heating to 100 °C for 3 min followed by slow cooling to 25 °C. After hybridization, 5× DNA loading buffer (0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 50% glycerol) was added to a final concentration of 1×, and the mixture was electrophoresed through an 8% native polyacrylamide gel for 1 h at 100 V in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, 4.5 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA) to remove unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP and free oligonucleotides. The substrates were located by autoradiography and the products were excised from the gel, which was sliced into small pieces and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h in 3 volumes of an elution buffer containing 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected and the substrates were ethanol precipitated and resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). Due to low recovery of duplex RNA substrates, 10-fold more RNA oligonucleotide (50 pmol) was 5′-end labeled with the same amount of [γ-32P]ATP (16.7 pmol, 3,000 mCi/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The specific activity of the DNA substrates was ∼3,000 cpm/fmol and that of duplex RNA ∼500 cpm/fmol. DNA Helicase Assay—DNA helicase activity of the ecDnaB was measured in reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm ATP, 10 fmol 32P-labeled DNA substrate, and ecDnaB protein as indicated in the figure legends.

Aliquots were loaded onto an 8% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE and electrophoresed for 1.5 h at 200 V at 4 °C. Gels were visualized and quantitated by phosphorimaging. All helicase experiments were repeated at least three times, and their averages with standard deviations are shown in the figures together with representative gels. Filter Binding Assay—Oligonucleotides for DNA and RNA filter binding assays were prepared by labeling the oligonucleotide using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed from the single-stranded substrate using Sephadex G-50 column chromatography. Nitrocellulose filter binding assays were performed with 50 fmol 32P-labeled substrate. The binding reactions were performed at 60 °C (mtMCM), 30 °C (spMCM) or 37 °C (ecDnaB) for 10 min in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. After incubation, the mixture was filtered through an alkaline-washed nitrocellulose filter (Millipore, HA 0.45 μm) (11McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The radioactivity adsorbed to the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting. All DNA binding experiments were repeated three times, and their averages with standard deviations are shown in Fig. 4. Streptavidin/Nitroavidin Displacement Assay—Biotinylated oligonucleotides were 5′-end labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified as described above for the preparation of substrates for filter binding assay. Ten fmol of oligonucleotides (as indicated in the figure legends) were incubated with 750 fmol streptavidin for the experiments with the mtMCM or with 1.5 pmol nitroavidin for the experiments with spMCM and ecDnaB in the respective helicase reaction mixtures (15 μl) at 30 °C for 10 min. Next, the helicase was added together with 10 pmol free biotin for each reaction (to trap and sequester streptavidin or nitroavidin when released from the oligonucleotides by the helicase). After incubation for 1 h at 55 °C (mtMCM), 30 °C (spMCM), or 37 °C (ecDnaB), 5 μl of 5× loading buffer (100 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 50% glycerol) was added to each sample, followed by electrophoretic analysis on a native 8% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE. The gels were analyzed using phosphorimaging. All experiments were repeated three times with almost identical results. Representative gels are shown in Fig. 2. ATPase Assay—ATPase activity was measured in reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.5 nmol ATP containing 0.495 pmol [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and 90 fmol mtMCM (as hexamer) or 270 fmol spMCM and ecDnaB (as hexamer) in the presence or absence of 2 pmol 25-base DNA or RNA oligonucleotide as indicated in the legend of Fig. 5. After incubation at 60 °C (mtMCM), 30 °C (spMCM), or 37 °C (ecDnaB) for 60 min, a 1-μl aliquot was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer plate, and ATP and Pi were separated by chromatography in 1 m formic acid and 0.5 m LiCl. The extent of ATP hydrolysis was quantitated by phosphorimager analysis. The Replicative Helicases of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya Can Unwind DNA-RNA Hybrid—It has not yet been determined whether the archaeal or eukaryal MCM proteins are capable of unwinding substrates containing RNA, and only limited studies have been performed with the bacterial DnaB protein (12Santamaria D. de la Cueva G.

Thus, the ability of a replicative helicase from bacteria, archaea, and eukarya to unwind RNA-containing substrate was determined. It was shown previously that the spMCM complex is unable to displace a DNA substrate with a duplex region of 20 bp or longer when provided with only a 3′-ssDNA overhang (Ref. 13Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar and supplemental Fig. S1). To unwind that substrate, the helicase required a forked DNA structure containing both 3′- and 5′-overhanging ssDNA (13Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14You Z. Ishimi Y. Mizuno T. Sugasawa K. Hanaoka F. Masai H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6148-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similar observations have been made with the bacterial DnaB protein (supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, all substrates used in the first set of experiments (Fig. 1) contained duplex regions of 25 bp in length and forked structures (containing both 3′- and 5′-overhang single-stranded regions) as shown schematically at the top of each panel in Fig. 1. First, as a control, the ability of the enzymes to unwind duplex DNA was determined. All three helicases can unwind such substrates with comparable efficiencies to those previously reported for the enzymes (Fig. 1, A–C, lanes 3–5 (I), see also panels D–F). Next, the ability of the helicase to unwind duplex RNA substrates was determined. None of the enzymes, mtMCM, spMCM, or ecDnaB, could unwind these substrates (Fig. 1, A–C, lanes 18–20 (IV), see also panels D–F). Although the enzymes cannot unwind duplex RNA, they may have the ability to unwind substrates containing RNA-DNA hybrids. There are two types of such hybrid substrates. One contains 3′-overhanging DNA and 5′-overhanging RNA, whereas the other has the reverse, 3′-overhanging RNA and 5′-overhanging DNA. The ability of the enzyme to unwind both types of substrates was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 1, A–C, all three helicases are capable of unwinding hybrid DNA-RNA substrates when translocating along the DNA strand (Fig. 1, A–C, lanes 8–10 (II), see also panels D and E; recall that the eukaryotic and archaeal MCM have a 3′→5′ polarity on ssDNA whereas DnaB moves in the 5′→3′ direction). No unwinding could be observed, however, when the M. thermautotrophicus and S. pombe MCM proteins were provided with a 3′-RNA overhang (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 13–15 (III), see also panels D and E) or when the ecDnaB was provided with 5′-RNA overhang (Fig. 1C, lanes 13–15 (III), see also panel F). Interestingly, the E. coli enzyme unwinds hybrid RNA-DNA duplex more efficiently than duplex DNA (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 8–10 (II) with lanes 3–5 (I), see also panel F) whereas the MCM helicases are slightly inhibited (Fig. 1, A and B, compare lanes 8–10 (II) with lanes 3–5 (I), see also panels D and E). The reason for the difference is not clear. However, it may be due to the base composition of the substrates. It is well established that the stability of a DNA-RNA hybrid depends on which strand is the DNA and which is the RNA (e.g. Ref. 15Roberts R.W. Crothers D.M. Science. 1992; 258: 1463-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Thus, although the same oligonucleotide sequences were used to make the substrate for DnaB and the MCM helicases, due to the different directionality of the DnaB and MCM (5′→3′ and 3′→5′, respectively), the DNA and RNA strands are “reversed” in the substrates used for ecDnaB in comparison with the two MCM proteins. It may be that the substrate used for the ecDnaB is less stable compared with that used for the MCM proteins. The results presented in Fig. 1 demonstrate that although the helicases cannot unwind RNA substrates they can separate DNA-RNA hybrids if provided with a ssDNA region to move on. However, although the enzymes can unwind RNA-DNA hybrid substrates, the rate of unwinding a duplex DNA may be different from that for a RNA-DNA hybrid. Thus, the experiments described in Fig. 1 were repeated, varying the reaction time instead of helicase concentration (supplemental Fig. S2). Similar to the results of Fig. 1, both the eukaryal and archaeal MCM proteins are not as efficient at unwinding hybrid substrates in comparison with their activity on DNA substrates, but no clear difference in the rate of unwinding could be observed. The Replicative Helicases Cannot Translocate along RNA—The results shown in Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S2 suggest that the helicases cannot move along RNA. To determine whether the enzyme can translocate along RNA, another, more direct approach was used. It was previously shown that the mtMCM is capable of displacing streptavidin from biotinylated oligonucleotides while moving along DNA and that ATP is required for this activity (16Shin J.H. Jiang Y. Grabowski B. Hurwitz J. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49053-49062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed using biotinylated oligonucleotides that were pre-bound by streptavidin. The mtMCM was incubated with the substrate in the presence of a large excess of biotin. The biotin in solution served as a trap to bind streptavidin upon its displacement from the DNA by the helicase. A similar approach was used to determine whether the mtMCM is able to translocate along RNA. As shown in Fig. 2A, the enzyme can displace streptavidin from biotinylated DNA (lanes 3–6) and ATP is required for the activity (lane 7). No displacement could be observed when biotinylated RNA was used (lanes 10–13). It was previously shown that the spMCM and ecDnaB could not displace streptavidin from biotinylated oligonucleotides (16Shin J.H. Jiang Y. Grabowski B. Hurwitz J. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49053-49062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Streptavidin binds biotin very tightly (Kd ∼ 10–15m) (18Green N.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1975; 29: 85-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar), which may explain the inability of the eukaryal and bacterial helicases to remove it from biotinylated oligonucleotides. An avidin derivative, nitroavidin, binds biotin with much lower affinity (Kd > 10–9 m) (19Morag E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of the ecDnaB and spMCM complex to displace nitroavidin from biotinylated oligonucleotide was analyzed in an experiment similar to that performed with streptavidin. It was found that both the spMCM (Fig. 2B, lanes 3–5) and ecDnaB (Fig. 2C, lanes 3–5) protein are capable of displacing nitroavidin from biotinylated DNA. Neither enzyme could do so if ATP was omitted from the reaction (Fig. 2, B and C, lanes 6), demonstrating that active movement by the helicase is required. In contrast, when biotinylated RNA was used instead of DNA, no nitroavidin displacement could be observed (Fig. 2, B and C, lanes 9–11), supporting the conclusion drawn from Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S2 that the enzymes cannot move along RNA. Taken together, the data presented above demonstrate that the bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryal helicases cannot translocate along RNA or unwind RNA duplexes. They all can, however, displace RNA from a RNA-DNA hybrid while moving along the DNA strand. It is possible that the helicase cannot initiate translocation from RNA but could move along RNA if movement starts on DNA. Thus, the ability of the helicases to unwind substrates containing RNA-DNA chimeric oligonucleotides (schematically shown at the top of each panel of Fig. 3; DNA strands, solid line; RNA strands, dashed line) was determined. On these substrates, the helicase would either assemble on the DNA and then move to the RNA portion of the substrate or perform the reverse, assemble on the RNA and then move to the DNA. As shown in Fig. 3, each helicase is unable to unwind these chimeric substrates regardless of whether it first assembles on the RNA (Fig. 3, A–C, lanes 3–5) or DNA (lanes 8–10) portion of the substrate. These data demonstrate that assembly on DNA is not sufficient to promote RNA translocation and substrate unwinding by the helicases. All Three Replicative Helicases Can Bind RNA—If the helicases cannot interact with RNA it would explain why the helicases cannot move along it. Therefore, the ability of the ecDnaB, mtMCM, and spMCM proteins to bind RNA was determined using 50-mer oligonucleotide in a filter binding assay. As shown in Fig. 4, all three enzymes bind RNA, though not as well as DNA. Nevertheless, the data suggest that lack of RNA binding is not the reason for the inability of the enzymes to move along it. RNA Cannot Stimulate the ATPase Activity of the Replicative Helicases—The data presented in Fig. 4 demonstrate that the enzymes can bind RNA. However, to unwind the substrate the enzymes not only need to interact with the substrate but also to move along it. It is well established that the movement of ecDnaB, mtMCM, and spMCM along ssDNA stimulates their ATPase activity. Stimulation of ATPase activity is therefore indirect evidence for helicase movement along nucleic acids. Thus, an ATPase assay was used to determine whether the helicases are capable of translocation along RNA. As expected, the ATPase activity of all three helicases is stimulated by ssDNA (Fig. 5, A–C). RNA, on the other hand, does not stimulate ATPase activity; only the basal level of activity was observed with mtMCM and spMCM (Fig. 5, A and B). The ecDnaB protein exhibits a different behavior. Its ATPase activity is inhibited in the presence of RNA (Fig. 5C). The reason for this is not clear. As the MCM and DnaB proteins have different structures it is possible that upon binding to RNA the ecDnaB structure is locked in a conformation that prevents the intrinsic ATPase activity, the access of the nucleoside to the active site, or dissociation of the ADP after hydrolysis. The Replicative Helicases Can Translocate along DNA-RNA Duplexes—The replicative helicases of bacteria, archaea, and eukarya are all capable of translocating along duplex DNA (16Shin J.H. Jiang Y.

Whereas the archaeal MCM can slide onto duplex DNA (16Shin J.H. Jiang Y. Grabowski B. Hurwitz J. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49053-49062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the eukaryotic MCM requires a 3′-ssDNA overhang (16Shin J.H. Jiang Y. Grabowski B. Hurwitz J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 49171-49182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and DnaB requires a 5′-ssDNA overhang (17Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). After establishing that the helicases cannot move along RNA (Figs. 1, 2, 3), their ability to move along a RNA-DNA duplex was determined using substrates similar to those previously used to demonstrate dsDNA translocation by the enzymes (16Shin J.H. Jiang Y. Grabowski B. Hurwitz J. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49053-49062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Kaplan D.L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49171-49182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that although DnaB and the eukaryotic MCM require a single-stranded overhang region (5′ for DnaB and 3′ for MCM), the archaeal enzyme can initiate duplex translocation from a blunt end (16Shin J.H. Jiang Y. Grabowski B. Hurwitz J. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49053-49062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Kaplan D.L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49171-49182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Three oligonucleotides were constructed and hybridized to produce the desired single-stranded and double-stranded regions of DNA or RNA (schematically shown at the top of each panel in Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 6, all three enzymes are capable of translocating along the RNA-DNA duplex, as is evident from the displacement of the right duplex region (Fig. 6, A–C, lanes 8–10 (II), see also panels D–F). Translocation along the hybrid duplex is indistinguishable from translocation along duplex DNA (Fig. 5, A–C, compare lanes 8–10 (II) to lanes 3–5 (I), see also panels D–F). It is possible, however, that the bacterial and eukaryal enzymes displace the RNA prior to the displacement of the downstream duplex. This is not the case, however, as neither of the enzymes can unwind DNA or RNA duplexes of 25 nucleotides if not provided with a forked DNA substrate (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). In addition, all three enzymes have the ability to displace streptavidin (mtMCM) or nitroavidin (spMCM and ecDnaB) from DNA-RNA hybrids (data not shown). These results show that, in contrast to RNA translocation, when the RNA is a part of a RNA-DNA hybrid duplex the helicase can move along it without major difficulty. The study described here demonstrates that the three replicative helicases studied, representing the three domains of life, are capable of unwinding a DNA-RNA hybrid. What might the in vivo role of such activity be? Does the replicative helicase encounter RNA-DNA hybrids during chromosomal DNA replication? A growing number of studies in bacteria and eukarya suggest that such RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) do exist on DNA. Therefore, if these structures are not removed from the DNA ahead of the replication fork the replicative helicase has to remove or bypass them. Studies conducted with bacteria and eukarya demonstrated that under some circumstances RNA-DNA hybrids form as the result of transcription in cells harboring mutations in certain genes. For example, transcription in E. coli cells harboring a mutation in topoisomerase I results in stable R-loop RNA-DNA hybrids (21Masse E. Phoenix P. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Broccoli S. Rallu F. Sanscartier P. Cerritelli S.M. Crouch R.J. Drolet M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1769-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Similarly, studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hpr1 mutant cells show that RNA-DNA hybrid structures are formed during transcription (23Huertas P. Aguilera A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 711-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The depletion of the splicing factor ASF/SF2 from chicken cells also results in the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids (24Li X. Manley J.L. Cell. 2005; 122: 365-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Although these and other examples demonstrate that mutations in different genes can result in transcription-mediated RNA-DNA hybrid formation, the base composition of the gene transcribed may dictate whether R-loops are formed. It was shown that when transcription results in long purine-rich stretches of RNA it promotes the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids (25Grabczyk E. Fishman M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1791-1797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Reaban M.E. Lebowitz J. Griffin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21850-21857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA-DNA hybrids may also play important roles during normal cell growth. It is well established that dsRNA can regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally via RNA interference. Recently, evidence suggests that short RNA molecules may also directly regulate transcription by regulating cytosine methylation at promoter regions and by chromatin modification (Refs. 27Corey D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 655-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar and 28Bernstein E. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1635-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar and references therein). Although the exact mechanism by which the RNA regulates these cellular process is unknown, it was suggested that it may be mediated by the formation of an R-loop containing RNA-DNA hybrids on the chromosome (27Corey D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 655-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Grewal S.I. Moazed D. Science. 2003; 301: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 30Bayne E.H. Allshire R.C. Trends Genet. 2005; 21: 370-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, either as a result of mutation or due to normal cell growth, the replicative helicase may encounter RNA along its path during chromosomal replication. As the helicase would be translocating along DNA following assembly at the origin, the data presented here suggest that such RNA on DNA would not inhibit DNA replication as it likely would be removed by the helicase. The replicative helicases, at least the eukaryotic MCM complex, may also play a direct role during transcription elongation. MCM was shown to interact with the eukaryotic RNA polymerase (7Holland L. Gauthier L. Bell-Rogers P. Yankulov K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5192-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8Yankulov K. Todorov I. Romanowski P. Licatalosi D. Cilli K. McCracken S. Laskey R. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6154-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The MCM complex also interacts with the transcription activator Stat1 (31DaFonseca C.J. Shu F. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3034-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32Zhang J.J. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Lathem W.W. Ritzi M. Knippers R. Darnell Jr., J.E.

A. 2005; 102: 14539-14544Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and interaction with MCM is required for Stat1-mediated transcription (33Snyder M. He W. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14539-14544Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It was also found that MCM moves along with RNA polymerase during transcription, and it was suggested that the MCM may unwind the DNA ahead of the RNA polymerase (33Snyder M. He W. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14539-14544Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the bacterial and archaeal helicases may also have roles in transcription. In addition, in light of the data presented here, it is also possible that, if under certain circumstances the transcript reannealed to the template DNA, the helicase could unwind it behind the RNA polymerase.

Morbidity and mortality in CF result primarily from chronic airway infection, which results in progressive deterioration of lung function. Two recent clinical studies have demonstrated short and long term benefits of nebulized hypertonic saline in improving lung function in CF (1Donaldson S.H. Bennett W.D. Zeman K.L. Knowles M.R.

Prior clinical studies also support the efficacy of various inhaled hyperosmolar agents in CF (3Robinson M. Regnis J.A. Bailey D.L. King M. Bautovich G.J. Bye P.T. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Med. 2006; 354: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) concludes that hypertonic saline produces sustained elevation in airway surface liquid (ASL) volume, which improves mucociliary clearance in the airways. However, a paradoxical effect was found when amiloride was administered together with hypertonic saline. Rather than improving lung function because of its inhibitory effect on ENaC and consequent prevention of ASL absorption, amiloride negated the beneficial effect of hypertonic saline. To account for these findings, Donaldson et al. (1Donaldson S.H. Bennett W.D. Zeman K.L. Knowles M.R. Tarran R. Boucher R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 354: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) postulated the involvement of airway AQPs in establishing ASL volume (Fig. 1) and reported strong amiloride inhibition of osmotic water permeability in airway epithelial cells. In their model, ENaC hyperactivity dehydrates the ASL in CF airways (Fig. 1, left panel), and hypertonic saline restores ASL volume (middle panel). If amiloride acts only on ENaC, then amiloride is predicted to increase ASL volume (Fig. 1, right, top panel). To account for the clinical data, they hypothesize that amiloride inhibits airway AQPs, which prevents water from entering the airways (Fig. 1, right, bottom panel). The proposed involvement of AQPs in ASL regulation is surprising, as is the inhibition of AQP water permeability by amiloride. Osmotically induced water transport across airways has been shown to be high and likely AQP-dependent in microperfused small airways (7Folkesson H. Matthay M. Frigeri A. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 664-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and later in cultured human tracheal epithelial cells (8Matsui H. Davis C.W. Tarran R. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1419-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and in spheroids composed of airway epithelial cell monolayers (9Pedersen P.S. Procida K. Larsen P.L. Holstein-Rathlou N.H. Frederiksen O. Pfluegers Arch. 2005; 451: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Despite this, the reduction of airway epithelial water permeability by deletion of the various lung/airway aquaporins (AQPs 1, 3, 4 and 5) in transgenic mice did not affect ASL volume or ionic composition (10Song Y. Jayaraman S. Yang B. Matthay M.A. Verkman A.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Inhibition of AQP water permeability by amiloride is surprising, because amiloride has no aquaretic effect at concentrations that inhibit ENaC in the renal distal tubule. Here, we tested the hypothesis of Donaldson et al. (1Donaldson S.H. Bennett W.D. Zeman K.L. Knowles M.R. Tarran R. Boucher R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 354: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) by characterizing water permeability and amiloride effects in human bronchial epithelial cell cultures, stably transfected epithelial cells expressing airway/lung AQPs, and intact lung using a variety of biophysical methods to quantify water transport. Water permeabilities of airway cells and intact lung surface were found to be high and AQP-dependent, although amiloride did not inhibit water permeability nor did it inhibit water permeability of the individual AQPs. These findings have important implications for understanding the benefit of hypertonic saline in CF and for future development of related strategies for the therapy of CF lung disease. Cell Culture—Surface bronchial epithelial cells were obtained from non-CF human lung specimens that were not suitable for lung transplantation. CF bronchial epithelial cells were obtained from patients at the time of transplantation. The cells were dissociated by enzymatic digestion, as described previously (11Yamaya M. Finkbeiner W.E.

The next day, the cells were rinsed with PBS, and the medium was replaced with air-liquid interface medium (12Fulcher M.L. Gabriel S. Burns K.A. Yankaskas J.R. Randell S.H. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 107: 183-206PubMed Google Scholar) containing gentamicin, penicillin, and streptomycin at the concentrations given above. The medium was changed daily. When the cell sheets became confluent and actively absorbed mucosal fluid, as indicated by the loss of apical fluid in the central portion of the insert (generally 3-5 days), the mucosal surface was rinsed with PBS, and medium was added only to the basal side of the insert. For some experiments, bronchial epithelial cells (non-CF and CF) were obtained after expansion in human placental collagen-coated tissue culture flasks. After 80-90% confluence, cells were released using 0.05% trypsin and 0.2% EDTA in 0.9% NaCl at 37 °C. The trypsin was neutralized with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing 20% fetal calf serum, and propagated cells were resuspended in plating medium and seeded onto cell culture inserts as described above but designated as passage 1 (P1) cultures. By day 15 after seeding, both P0 and P1 cultures formed tight layers with transepithelial resistance of 1-2 kΩ·cm2, at which time they were used for experiments. Cultures were confirmed to express cAMP-activated CFTR by measurement of short circuit current, as reported previously (13Pedemonte N. Lukacs G.L. Du K. Caci E. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2564-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Protocols were approved by the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Human Research. Fisher rat thyroid (FRT) epithelial cells stably transfected with either control plasmid (encoding yellow fluorescent protein) or with plasmids encoding AQP1, AQP3, or AQP4 (14Saadoun S. Papadopoulos M.C. Hara-Chikuma M. Verkman A.S. Nature. 2005; 434: 786-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) were grown in F-12/Coombs medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and the appropriate antibiotic selection markers. For dye dilution experiments, FRT cells were plated onto uncoated Transwell inserts and used for flux measurements at resistances of 2-5 kΩ·cm2. Transepithelial Water Permeability—Osmotic water permeabilities across human bronchial epithelial (HBE) and FRT cell layers were determined using a dye dilution method, as depicted in Fig. 2A. The dilution of a cell-impermeant, photostable, inert dye (Texas Red™-dextran, 10 kDa; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used as a measure of transcellular osmotic water flux. The basal surface of cells on the porous filter was bathed in 1 ml of isosmolar PBS. The apical surface was bathed in 200 μl of hyperosmolar PBS (PBS + 300 mm d-mannitol) containing 0.25 mg/ml Texas Red-dextran. In some experiments, 100-500 μm amiloride (Sigma-Aldrich), dissolved freshly from powder, was added to the apical buffer, as done by Donaldson et al. (1Donaldson S.H. Bennett W.D. Zeman K.L. Knowles M.R. Tarran R. Boucher R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 354: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), or to both the apical and basal bathing buffers. Cultures were placed in a 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator (at 27 or 37 °C), and 5 μl samples of dye-containing apical fluid were collected at specified times. The samples were diluted in 2 ml of PBS, and fluorescence was measured by cuvette fluorimetry (Fluoro Max-3; Horiba, Tokyo, Japan). In some experiments, the osmotic gradient was reversed by the addition of mannitol to the basal rather than the dye-containing apical solution. In other experiments, the pH of either the basal or apical solutions was adjusted to 5.0 using buffers containing 137.6 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 6 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (for pH 7.4) or MES (for pH 5.0). In some experiments, HgCl2 (0.2 or 1 mm) was added to the apical and basolateral solutions 5 min prior to the osmotic gradient. For computation of transepithelial osmotic water permeability coefficients (Pf, in cm/s), the time course of fluorescence in response to solution osmolarity changes, F(t), was fitted to a single exponential time constant, F(t)/Fo = B + A·e-t/τ, where Fo is initial fluorescence, A is amplitude, and τ is the exponential time constant. Because of dye binding to cells and/or the support, data used for exponential regression was collected at 5 min and later after establishing the osmotic gradient. Water flux was computed as the rate of dye dilution by dV(0)/dt = Vo·A/τ, which follows from the relation: F(t)/Fo = Vo/(Vo + V(t)). Vo is the initial volume of dye-containing apical buffer (0.2 cm3), and V(t) is the apical solution volume at time t. From these equations, Pf was computed as dV(0)/dt = Pf·S·vw·(Φ1 - Φ2), where S is the tissue surface area assuming a smooth surface (1.13 cm2), vw is the partial molar volume of water (18 cm3/mol), and (Φ1 - Φ2) is the transepithelial osmotic gradient (3 × 10-4 mol/cm3). Plasma Membrane Water Permeability—Plasma membrane osmotic water permeability was measured using a calceinquenching method (shown in Fig. 3A) that has been applied previously to in vitro and in vivo cell systems (15Solenov E. Watanabe H. Manley G.T. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C426-C432Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 16Levin M.H. Verkman A.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 4423-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with calcein by incubation with PBS containing 10 μm calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. HBE cultures grown on collagen-coated supports were studied by cutting the flat supports from the plastic inserts and mounting them in a custom-built perfusion chamber with support bottoms pressed against a coverslip and apical cell surfaces exposed to the perfusate. FRT cells grown on glass coverslips were inserted in a similar perfusion chamber but with cells facing upwards. Solutions were exchanged between PBS (290 mOsm) and hyperosmolar PBS (590 mOsm, PBS with added d-mannitol) using a gravity pinch valve system (ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY). Perfusates contained either Me2SO vehicle (0.1%) or amiloride (500 μm) added from a 1000× Me2SO stock solution. Fluorescence was excited using an X-cite 120 mercury lamp (EXFO Life Sciences, Ontario, Canada) and focused through an inverted epifluorescence microscope through a long working distance 25× air objective (numerical aperture 0.35, Leitz). Excitation and emission light was filtered using a custom cube (Chroma, Rockingham, VT), and fluorescence was collected using a 14-dynode photomultiplier and then amplified, digitized, and recorded using custom software (written in LabView, National Instruments, Austin, TX). To compute plasma membrane Pf, relative fluorescence (F(t)/Fo) was fitted to a single exponential function (as above) for FRT cell studies or a biexponential function (F(t)/Fo = A·e-t/τ1 + B·e-t/τ2 + C) for HBE studies. Plasma membrane Pf was computed as described above, where surface area S was taken as the apical surface area of the cell monolayer, assuming a flat, smooth surface. The time-varying cell layer height, h(t), was related to normalized amplitudes according to the predicted 50% final decrease from initial height (ho) under hypertonic conditions. For FRT and HBE cells, ho was taken as 5 and 20 μm, respectively. Pf was then computed from dh(0)/dt = Pf·vw·(Φ1 - Φ2). Airspace-Capillary Water Permeability in Intact Lung— Wild-type and AQP5-deficient mice in a CD1 genetic background (age 8-14 weeks) (17Ma T. Song Y. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20071-20074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) were sacrificed using an overdose of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (avertin, Sigma-Aldrich) intraperitoneally. Protocols were approved by the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Animal Research. The trachea was transected and cannulated, the pulmonary artery was cannulated, and the heart and lungs were moved en bloc to a perfusion chamber as described previously (18Carter E.P. Matthay M.A. Farinas J. Verkman A.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After ensuring that no air leaks were present, 0.5 ml of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran solution (10 kDa, 0.5 mg/ml in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich), with or without freshly dissolved amiloride (500 μm), was instilled into the tracheal catheter. The pulmonary artery was perfused at constant pressure (∼60 cm H2O) with PBS, with or without 500 μm amiloride, for at least 5 min before measurements. The pleural surface was washed continuously with PBS, and perfusate and wash effluent were continuously withdrawn from the chamber by suction (perfusate flow 5 ml/min). The time course of fluorescence intensity from a 3-5-mm spot on the lung pleural surface, in a similar location for all samples, was continuously monitored while perfusate fluid was exchanged between isosmolar and hyperosmolar PBS (PBS + 300 mm d-mannitol) using the microscope setup, detection system, and gravity pinch valve system described above. Histology and Immunocytochemistry—Paraffin sections of P0 HBE cell culture inserts and fixed human trachea were prepared. For paraffin sections, inserts were fixed for at least 30 min in buffered formalin (10%) and stored in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Standard tissue dehydration and paraffin infiltration was performed in a Tissue-Tek VIP processor (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA). Sections were cut at 4 μm on a rotary microtome and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Specimens were viewed and photographed on an Olympus light microscope (Olympus America, Inc., Melville, NY) equipped with a digital imaging system (QImaging, Burnaby, Canada). Immunostaining was done by standard procedures using polyclonal antibodies for AQP3, AQP4, and AQP5 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) incubated for 2 h and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Sigma-Aldrich) incubated for 30 min. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA from HBE cells scraped freshly from P0 culture inserts was isolated by homogenization in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and mRNA was extracted using the Oligotex mRNA midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was reverse transcribed from mRNA with oligo(dT) (SuperScript II preamplification kit, Invitrogen). Primers were designed to amplify 300-350 base pair fragments of cDNAs encoding human β-actin (sense, 5′-GCATGGAGTCCTGTGGCATCC-3′; antisense, 5′-CATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAC-3′), AQP1 (sense, 5′-GCCATCG GCCTCTCTGTAGCC-3′; antisense 5′-CTATTTGGGCTTCATCTGCAC-3′), AQP2 (sense, 5′-ACCTCCTTGGGATCCATTACA-3′; antisense, 5′-TCAGGCCTTGGTACCCCGTGG-3′), AQP3 (sense, 5′-CTGGTGGTCCTGGTCATTGGC-3′; antisense, 5′-CTGCTCCTTGTGCTTCACATG-3′), AQP4 (sense, 5′-GGACCTGCAGTTATCATGGGA-3′; antisense, 5′-CAATACCTCTCCAGATTGTGC-3′), AQP5 (sense, 5′-CTGTCCATTGGCCTGTCTGTC-3′, antisense, 5′-GCGGGTGGTCAGCTCCATGGT-3′), AQP6 (sense, 5′-CTGGGCCACCTCATTGGGATC-3′; antisense, 5′-TCACACACTCTCCATCTCCAC-3), AQP7 (sense, 5′-CAGGTCTTCAGCAATGGGGAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CTCTAGGGCCATGGATTCATG-3′), AQP8 (sense, 5′-GTGGCAGAGATCATCCTGACG-3′; antisense, 5′-TTCAGGATGAGGCGGGTCTTC-3′), and AQP9 (sense, 5′-GACTCCAGAAACTTGGGAGCC-3′; antisense, 5′-TTGTCCTCAGATTGTTCTGCC-3′). RT-PCR (for stained agarose gels) was performed with the TaqDNA polymerase kit (Invitrogen), and PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel. Fluorescence-based real-time RT-PCR was done to compare relative AQP3, AQP4, and AQP5 mRNA expression in non-CF versus CF cells using the LightCycler™ and with the LightCycler FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Surface epithelial cells were dissociated from human bronchi, quick-frozen, and stored at -80 °C until thawed for RNA isolation. PCR primers were as described above. Results were reported as a normalized, calibrated ratio with all samples normalized to β-actin. Concentration ratios for each CF and non-CF sample were calibrated to calibrator samples (pooled cDNA from non-CF subjects), with the results reported as a normalized ratio with the calibrator sample as the denominator as follows: relative mRNA level = ratio of sample (target/reference)/ratio of calibrator (target/reference). Water transport in airway surface epithelium was studied using well differentiated HBE cell cultures. Transepithelial osmotic water permeability was measured using a dye dilution method that assays water flux across tight epithelia cultured on porous filters (Fig. 2A). The fluorescence of an apical solution volume marker provided a quantitative readout of osmotically driven water transport across the cell layer. An induced osmotic gradient caused transepithelial water movement from which osmotic water permeability (Pf) was deduced. The P0 non-CF cultures were first characterized. Fig. 2B (top) shows fluorescence dilution at 37 °C, in which a 300 mm gradient of d-mannitol induced osmotic water flux into the apical, dye-containing solution. Data in the absence versus the presence of amiloride (500 μm) were compared. Fig. 2C summarizes transepithelial Pf values. There was no significant difference in Pf upon exposure of P0 HBE cultures to high dose amiloride (control versus amiloride, 54 ± 5 versus 52 ± 7 μm/s). Lower concentrations of amiloride (100 and 250 μm) also did not change Pf (not shown). When the direction of the osmotic gradient was reversed by the addition of mannitol to the basal bathing solution, the fluorescent volume marker became concentrated over time (Fig. 2B, middle). The deduced transepithelial Pf (46 ± 15 μm/s) did not differ significantly from that in control studies (mannitol in apical solution), indicating symmetrical water transport. To investigate the involvement of AQPs in HBE water permeability, experiments were done at reduced temperature (27 °C) and with reduced pH in the apical or basal bathing solutions (Fig. 2C, bottom). Pf at 27 °C (47 ± 9 μm/s) was similar to that at 37 °C, indicating a low Arrhenius activation energy, as expected for AQP-facilitated water transport. Reducing apical solution pH to 5 did not change Pf significantly, whereas a basolateral solution pH of 5 decreased Pf by >90%, providing functional evidence for the involvement of basolateral membrane AQP3 in water permeability; the water permeability of AQP3 is inhibited at low pH, whereas that of other AQPs is not (19Zeuthen T. Klairke D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21631-21636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Non-CF and CF P1 cell cultures were also studied to mimic the culture conditions employed by Donaldson et al. (1Donaldson S.H. Bennett W.D. Zeman K.L. Knowles M.R. Tarran R. Boucher R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 354: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). As summarized in Fig. 2D, P1 cultures had ∼50% lower water permeability than P0 cultures but without significant differences comparing non-CF versus CF cultures or control cultures versus cultures exposed apically to 500 μm amiloride (or to 100 μm amiloride, not shown). Finally, as an additional attempt to look for amiloride-sensitive water transport, water permeability was measured in P0 non-CF cultures in the presence of both apically and basolaterally added amiloride (500 μm). As seen from the raw fluorescence data in Fig. 2E, osmotic water flux was not inhibited by high-dose amiloride, indicating the lack of amiloride inhibition of apical or basolateral AQPs. Plasma membrane water permeability in P0 HBE cultures was determined using a calcein-quenching method, which is based on rapid changes in cytoplasmic calcein fluorescence in response to changes in the concentration of cytoplasmic anionic proteins and hence to changes in cell volume (Fig. 3A) (15Solenov E. Watanabe H. Manley G.T. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C426-C432Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Supports with calcein-loaded HBE cells were mounted in a perfusion chamber for continuous measurement of cytoplasmic calcein fluorescence. Switching between isosmolar and hyperosmolar perfusates produced reversible changes in fluorescence with biexponential kinetics (Fig. 3B), probably reflecting the heterogeneous distribution of AQPs and the complicated geometry of bronchial epithelia. Pf was quantified from the initial kinetics of fluorescence change in response to osmotic gradients as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As summarized in Fig. 3C, the plasma membrane Pf was not significantly affected by inclusion of 500 μm amiloride in the perfusates. AQP expression was characterized in P0 HBE cells. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained transverse paraffin sections confirmed the differentiation of 2-week-old cultures into a ∼20-μm thick pseudostratified epithelium with numerous cilia (Fig. 4A). Cultures were scraped for RT-PCR analysis, which detected mRNA for several AQPs (Fig. 4B). Transcripts of AQP3, AQP4, and AQP5 were found in highest abundance, consistent with previous studies (see “Discussion”). Lesser but non-zero expression of AQP1, AQP6, and AQP7 mRNA was detected. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was done to compare expression of the principal AQPs in P0 HBE cultures from non-CF versus CF airways. As summarized in Fig. 4C, no significant differences were found in AQP transcript expression in non-CF versus CF cells. Immunofluorescence done on paraffin sections of HBE cultures and intact human bronchus demonstrated AQP3 and AQP4 protein expression on basolateral membranes, whereas AQP5 protein expression was not detected. Positive control staining of kidney for AQP3 and AQP4 is shown and of salivary gland for AQP5. We next investigated the possible effects of amiloride on the major lung AQPs, including AQP1 (expressed in microvascular endothelia), using AQP-transfected epithelial cells and intact mouse lung. Transepithelial and plasma membrane water permeabilities were measured in FRT cells expressing either yellow fluorescent protein (control), AQP1, AQP3, or AQP4. Transepithelial water permeability of FRT cell lines grown on Transwell supports was measured after the cultures formed electrically tight monolayers. Water permeabilities of AQP-expressing FRT cells were greater than that in control cells and not sensitive to amiloride (Fig. 5A, top). Fig. 5A (bottom) summarizes transepithelial Pf values. Plasma membrane water permeability was measured on the FRT cells, with calcein fluorescence curves fitted to single exponential functions (representative traces for FRT-AQP3 and FRT-AQP4 cells shown in Fig. 5B, top). In agreement with the measurements of transepithelial water permeability, plasma membrane Pf was increased with AQP expression and not sensitive to amiloride (Fig. 5B, bottom). Last, the effect of amiloride was investigated in intact, perfused mouse lung using a pleural surface method to measure airspace-capillary osmotic water permeability (18Carter E.P. Matthay M.A. Farinas J. Verkman A.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The airspace compartment was filled with isotonic fluid containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran as a volume marker. The kinetics of pleural surface fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran fluorescence was measured in response to changes in osmolality of the pulmonary artery perfusate. There was rapid osmotic equilibration across the airspace-capillary barrier, which was not affected by the inclusion of 500 μm amiloride in the airway instillate and pulmonary artery perfusate (Fig. 6A, top). In agreement with previous results (20Ma T. Fukuda N. Song Y. Matthay M.A. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), osmotic equilibration was ∼10-fold slowed in lungs of AQP5-deficient mice (Fig. 6A, bottom), indicating the involvement of AQP5 in airspace-capillary osmotic water transport. The rates of osmotic water equilibration in lungs from wild-type mice (with and without amiloride) are summarized in Fig. 6B. The primary purpose"
https://openalex.org/W2132831201,"Psu, a coat protein from bacteriophage P4, has been shown to inhibit Rho-dependent transcription termination in vivo. Co-overexpression of Psu and Rho led to the loss of viability of the cells, which is the consequence of the anti-Rho activity of the protein. The antitermination property of Psu is abolished either by the deletion of 10 or 20 amino acids from its C terminus or by a mutation, Y80C, in Rho. All these experiments indicated probable interactions between Rho and Psu. Purified Psu protein is α-helical in nature and appeared to be a dimer. Co-purification of Rho and wild-type Psu on an affinity matrix and co-elution of both of them in Superose-6 gel filtration suggests a direct association of these proteins, whereas a C terminus 10-amino acid deletion derivative of Psu failed to be pulled down in this assay. This indicates that the loss of the function of these mutants is correlated with their inability to interact with each other. In vitro termination assays revealed that Psu can inhibit Rho-dependent termination specifically in a concentration-dependent manner. The presence of Psu affected the affinity of ATP and reduced the rate of ATPase activity of Rho but did not affect either primary or secondary RNA binding activities. In the presence of Psu, Rho was also observed to release RNA very slowly from a stalled elongation complex. We propose that Psu inhibits Rho-dependent termination by slowing down the translocation of Rho along the RNA because of its slow ATPase activity.

Mechanism of inhibition of Rho-dependent transcription termination by bacteriophage P4 protein Psu.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 284Issue 37PreviewVOLUME 281 (2006) PAGES 26491–26500 Full-Text PDF Open Access A significant fraction of operons in Escherichia coli do not end with an intrinsic termination signal characterized by a hairpin followed by a U-rich sequence in the RNA. Transcription termination at the end of these operons as well as at the regulatory sites preceding genes, depends on a factor called Rho (1Richardson J.P. Greenblatt J. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R.

It binds to the exiting RNA of the elongation complex (EC) 4The abbreviations used are: EC, elongation complex; Psu, polarity suppression; WT, wild type; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; RB, roadblock complex; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. and dissociates it from the EC, most likely through a helicase activity coupled to ATP hydrolysis (2Richardson J.P.

Rho-dependent termination can elicit the polar effect, which is characterized by reduced expressions of downstream genes in an operon. Polarity suppression can occur if Rho is defective (5Das A. Court D. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1959-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Polarity in phage P2 is suppressed by the product of psu (polarity suppression), a late gene of phage P4 (6Sauer B. Ow D. Ling L. Calendar R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 7Sunshine M. Six E. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 106: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Psu, a 21-kDa protein, is also a component of capsids of the bacteriophage P4 (8Isaksen M.L. Rishovd S.T. Calendar R. Lindqvist B.H. Virology. 1992; 188: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 9Dokland T. Isaksen M.L. Fuller S.D. Lindqvist B.H. Virology. 1993; 194: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Psu protein efficiently antiterminates Rho-dependent termination in vivo and has no effect on intrinsic termination. It does not require any known antitermination sequence (10Linderoth N.A. Calendar R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6722-6731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard the mode of action of Psu is different from the lambdoid phage-derived antiterminators (10Linderoth N.A. Calendar R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6722-6731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Weisberg R.A. Gottesman M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 359-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Psu was also found to inhibit the Rho-dependent termination in a coupled transcription-translation assay using S-30 extracts (12Linderoth N.A. Tang G. Calendar R. Virology. 1997; 227: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The intracellular level of Rho is increased in Psu-expressing cells (12Linderoth N.A. Tang G. Calendar R. Virology. 1997; 227: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which is similar to that usually observed for the cells containing mutant Rho (13Martinez A. Opperman T. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 895-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although these results are suggestive of a Psu-Rho interaction, a direct interaction between Rho and Psu has not been demonstrated. The molecular basis of anti-Rho activity of Psu is also not known. In this report, we have demonstrated a direct and specific interaction between Rho and Psu and have shown that the C-terminal domain of Psu plays an important role in this process. A specific mutation in Rho, Y80C, was found to abolish the function of Psu. In vitro transcription termination by Rho was inhibited efficiently by Psu. However, in the presence of Psu, a slow release of RNA by Rho could be observed from a stalled elongation complex. Presence of Psu affected ATP binding and also the rate of RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis of Rho, which may reduce the speed of translocation of Rho along the RNA and thereby affected the termination efficiency of Rho.

These strains were grown on the respective indicator plates as described in the legend to Fig. 1 to assay the anti-Rho activity of Psu. WT bacterial strain MG1655 was also transformed with the plasmids bearing psu genes and used for growth assays (Fig. 1B). To check the in vivo activities of the WT and the C-terminal deletion derivatives of psu cloned in pET28b vectors, the plasmids were transformed into the Bl21(DE3) strain. In Fig. 1C, strains RS350 and RS359 bearing Y80C and WT rho genes, respectively, were transformed with plasmids carrying WT (pNL150) or mutant (pNL150M6) psu genes. Different dilutions of the saturated cultures were spotted on LB plates supplemented with 50 μm IPTG and checked for growth.TABLE 1Bacterial strains, plasmids, and phages used in this studyStrain/plasmid/phageDescriptionSource or referenceA.

PhageλRS45From J. Gowrishankar Open table in a new tab RNA Polymerase, Rho, and NusG Proteins—E. coli RNA polymerase was purchased either from Epicenter or from Amersham Biosciences. The Rho gene was PCR-amplified from E. coli chromosome and cloned in pET21b vector and purified according to the published procedure (15Nowatzke W. Richardson L. Richardson J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cloning and purification of NusG has been described elsewhere (14Cheeran A. Babu Suganthan R. Swapna G. Bandey I. Achary M.S. Nagarajaram H.A. Sen R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 28-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of WT and Mutant Psu Proteins—WT psu and psu M6 genes were PCR-amplified using proof-reading deep vent DNA polymerase (NEB), from the plasmids pNL150 and pNL150M6, respectively and were cloned at NdeI and XhoI sites of pET28b and pET21b, respectively (Qiagen). Plasmids were then sequenced to ensure the absence of any other mutations. The N-terminal His tag sequence comes from the vector. Deletions of 10 and 20 amino acids from the C terminus of Psu were obtained by PCR amplifications of the WT psu gene with suitable downstream primers, following which they were cloned in the pET28b vector. Non-His-tagged Psu proteins were purified according to the following procedure. Cultures containing MG1655 transformed with pNL150 (WT Psu) were grown in TB and were induced at A600 ∼0.3 with 100 μm IPTG. The induction was allowed for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were then harvested and resuspended in TGED buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 5% (v/v) glycerol). Following the addition of lysozyme (1 mg/ml), cells were lysed by sonication. The lysate was precipitated with 0.5% polymin P (Sigma). The supernatant was then subjected to 25% ammonium sulfate precipitation. The precipitate was resuspended and dialyzed against TGED. Protein was passed at first through Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Psu was collected from the flow-through fractions. Flow-through fractions were further loaded onto CM-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and Psu was eluted between 75 and 150 mm of NaCl. The eluted protein was stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 50% (v/v) glycerol. This procedure yielded about 95% pure protein. Psu M6 mutant was also purified in the same way. To purify the Rho·Psu complex in vivo, the BL21(DE3) strain was transformed with both overexpression plasmids of Psu (pET28b; KanR) and Rho (pET21b; AmpR), and only Psu was His-tagged at the N terminus. These two plasmids can be maintained in the same strain in the presence of both antibiotics. The complex was purified by passing the crude lysate over Ni-NTA resins (Qiagen). The concentrations of Rho and Psu were calculated using Bradford's method and from the intensities of the bands in the gel and comparing the intensities with proteins of similar molecular weights and known concentrations. Estimated concentrations from both the methods were comparable. The amounts of Rho and Psu in the Rho·Psu complex (in Fig. 3B) were estimated by comparing band intensities with the known amount of Rho and Psu, respectively. In the purified complex, the approximate amount of Psu was 2.2 μg/μl (∼52 μm of dimer) and that of Rho was 3.0 μg/μl (∼10 μm of hexamer). Templates for in Vitro Transcription—Plasmid pRS106 containing trp t′ terminator following a strong T7A1 promoter was constructed by replacing H-19B nutR-triple terminator cassette from plasmid pRS25 (14Cheeran A. Babu Suganthan R. Swapna G. Bandey I. Achary M.S. Nagarajaram H.A. Sen R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 28-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Linear DNA templates for in vitro transcription were made by PCR amplification using the plasmid pRS106. To immobilize the template on streptavidin coated magnetic beads, a biotinylated upstream primer was used. Lac operator sequence was incorporated in a downstream primer to make the templates with the operator sequence at the downstream edge. In Vitro Transcription—In vitro Rho-dependent termination reactions were performed in the transcription buffer (T buffer; 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl) at 37 °C. The reactions were initiated with 175 μm ApU, 5 μm each of GTP and ATP and 2.5 μm of CTP to make a 22-mer EC. This EC was labeled with [α-32P]CTP (∼3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). Then it was chased with 20 μm NTPs (Fig. 4). In the chasing reaction, either Rho or the Rho·Psu complex was added. To make the stalled road blocked complex (RB), Lac repressor was added before addition of the chasing solution. The chasing reaction was done with 20 μm NTPs for 2 min. RB was then washed three times to remove the NTPs. RB was then resuspended in the solution containing the indicated amounts of ATP (Fig. 6B), then Rho, either alone or together with WT or M6 Psu was added to this complex, and the supernatant and the pellet were separated after 3 min. To obtain the kinetics of RNA release in Fig. 6C, the RB was resuspended in either 0.1 mm (without Psu) or 1 mm ATP (with WT and M6 Psu), and RNA release was initiated by adding Rho alone or Rho·Psu (WT and M6) complexes. Aliquots were removed at different time points, and supernatant and pellets were separated using a magnetic stand. All the RNA release assays from the RB were performed using an immobilized DNA template on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Chemical Cross-linking—In vitro chemical cross-linking experiments were performed using glutaraldehyde (Sigma). Reactions were carried out in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7), 100 mm NaCl, and 12 mm glutaraldehyde. The reaction was stopped at different time points by adding sample buffer containing 400 mm glycine, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3% (w/v) SDS, 3% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Samples were loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE. Gel Filtration—Size exclusion chromatography was performed using Superose-6 10/300 GL column (dimension: 10 × 300-310 mm; bed volume ∼24 ml; Amersham Biosciences) with a Biologic Duoflow (Bio-Rad) protein purification system in the buffer containing 20 mm Tris.Cl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl. The flow rate for each run was 0.5 ml/min, and the sample volume was 500 μl. The amounts of Rho and Psu loaded were 0.4 mg and 0.32 mg, respectively. For the Rho·Psu complex, 80 μl of the stock concentration was diluted in 500 μl (Fig. 3). This corresponds to 0.24 mg of Rho and 0.18 mg of Psu. Elution profiles of thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa) (all from Sigma) were used to obtain the calibration curve. All the gel filtration experiments were run at room temperature. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectroscopy was performed using JASCO 810 at 25 °C. The scanning was done from 270 to 190 nm, in a cuvette with 0.1 cm path length. The composition of the buffer was same as that used in gel filtration assays. The estimation of secondary structure was done according to a published method (16Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar) using the manufacturer's software for the instrument. ATPase Assay—The ATPase activity of wild-type Rho in the absence and presence of Psu was assayed by monitoring the release of Pi from ATP using polyethyleneimine TLC plates and 0.75 m KH2PO4, pH 3.5 as a mobile phase under the following conditions. In all the ATPase assays, the composition of the reaction mixture was 25 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. To determine the concentration of poly(C) required for half-maximal ATPase activity, 25 nm of Rho was incubated with different concentrations of poly(C) (0-10 μm) (Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C for 5 min. The concentration of poly(C) was expressed in terms of the concentration of nucleotides. For the same experiments with Psu, 3.4 μm Psu was added to the mixture to form the Rho·Psu complex. Reaction was then initiated with 50 μm ATP together with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and stopped after 2 min with formic acid and spotted on TLC plates. The amount of inorganic phosphate (Pi) release was estimated by scanning the TLC plates in a Phosphorimager (Typhoon 9400; Amersham Biosciences). The concentration of poly(C) corresponding to half-maximal ATPase activity was determined by fitting the plot of amount of Pi release against concentration of poly(C) to a sigmoidal curve (Table 2). To calculate the Km value of ATP for Rho, in the same reaction mixture as mentioned above, 5 nm Rho or Rho·Psu complex ([Psu] = 3.4 μm) was incubated with 10 μm poly(C) at 30 °C for 10 min. ATP hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of different concentrations of ATP (10-100 μm) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). Aliquots were removed and mixed with formic acid at various time points depending on the concentrations of ATP. The product formation was linear in the time range that we used for calculating the initial rate of the reaction. The initial rates of the reaction were determined by plotting the amount of ATP hydrolyzed versus time using linear regression methods. Then the Km values for ATP were determined from the double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots (Table 2). The kinetics of ATP hydrolysis, using H-19B cro RNA as the cofactor (Fig. 5B), was also done under the same reaction conditions as mentioned. Concentrations of ATP and H-19B cro RNA were 50 μm and 0.2 μm, respectively. Concentrations of Rho and Psu were 25 nm and 3.4 μm, respectively. The reactions were done at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at various times after initiating reactions with ATP and [γ-32P]ATP and stopped by the addition of formic acid and spotted onto TLC plates. The activity is expressed in terms of percentage of inorganic phosphate released in the presence of Rho or Rho·Psu complex (Fig. 5B).TABLE 2Binding parameters of ATP and poly(C) for Rho in the absence and presence of PsuKm ATPaKm of ATP was determined from the initial rates of ATP hydrolysis in the concentration range of ATP from 10 to 100 μM.

The samples were placed on parafilm and were irradiated for 5 min at room temperature in CL-1000 Ultraviolet cross-linker from UVP. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography and quantified by Image QuantTL software. The plot of the intensities of the cross-linked species against increasing concentrations of ATP resulted in a binding isotherm. We determined the values of the apparent dissociation constant (Kd app) by hyperbolic fitting of the isotherms. Gel Shift Assays—Gel shift assays were performed in T-buffer supplemented with 10% glycerol. In a typical assay, 10 nm oligo(dC)34 (Sigma), a 34-mer oligonucleotide, was used. Oligo(dC)34 was end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). After adding different concentrations of Rho or Rho·Psu complex to the DNA, reactions were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C and loaded onto a 5% native polyacrylamide gel. The C-terminal End of Psu Is Important for Anti-Rho Activity—In vivo anti-Rho activity of Psu was demonstrated on two Rho-dependent terminators residing on multicopy plasmids (10Linderoth N.A. Calendar R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6722-6731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that the plasmid copy number increases drastically in the strains with mutant Rho (17Harinarayanan R. Gowrishankar J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 31-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and under this condition multicopy terminators might titrate Rho. We tested the effect of Psu on three Rho-dependent terminators, inserted as a single copy in the chromosome, to confirm that the anti-Rho activities of Psu in a plasmid-born system did not arise because of the copy number effect. Fig. 1A depicts that WT Psu inhibited the termination activities of Rho efficiently on the Rho-dependent terminators present in (i) the IS2 (galEP3) element upstream of the structural genes in the gal operon (red on the MacConkey galactose plate) (ii) the trp operon because of an ochre mutation (rapid growth on minimal media with anthranilate), and (iii) the nutR-TR1 site of lambdoid phage H-19B (red on the MacConkey lactose plate). These anti-Rho activities were not observed with a mutant Psu (M6, P169V), which had been isolated earlier (12Linderoth N.A. Tang G. Calendar R. Virology. 1997; 227: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore the observed antitermination phenotype was specific to Psu. Inhibition of growth in Psu-expressing cells was attributed to the polarity suppression activity of Psu (12Linderoth N.A. Tang G. Calendar R. Virology. 1997; 227: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A point mutation (P169V) in the C-terminal domain of Psu significantly reduced the inhibition on cell growth (12Linderoth N.A. Tang G. Calendar R. Virology. 1997; 227: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), suggesting that this region of Psu may be important for the function. Therefore, to define the functional importance of the region in the C terminus of Psu, we deleted 10 and 20 amino acid residues from the C terminus of Psu, respectively (Fig. 1B). The deletion constructs were cloned in pET vector and expressed in BL21 cells. Under a moderate level of induction ([IPTG] = 50 μm), WT Psu inhibited the growth of the cell, but not the deletion-derivatives of Psu (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the last 10 amino acid residues of the protein are important for the suppression of polarity. These deletion derivatives of Psu could be purified (discussed below), and appeared to be properly folded and stable under in vivo conditions. We speculate that, if there is a direct interaction between Psu and Rho, this region may be involved in that interaction. It is also possible that this region is important for proper oligomerization (see below) of Psu, or deletion of this region may have affected the overall conformation of the protein making it inactive. A Mutation in Primary RNA Binding Domain of Rho Abolishes the Function of Psu—To identify the mutation(s) in Rho, defective for Psu function, we tested the action of Psu on the strains with different termination defective mutants of Rho. 5J. Chalissery, S. Banerjee, I. Bandey, N. R. Kolli, and R. Sen, unpublished observation. We transformed the strains with different Rho mutants by the plasmid bearing a WT psu gene and screened for the viability of the strains in a similar way as described in the previous section. We observed that a mutation, Y80C, was specifically defective for Psu-mediated lethality (Fig. 1C). This mutation is in the primary RNA binding domain of Rho as revealed from the structure of Rho (Fig. 1D). This mutation by itself has high read-through at the Rho-dependent terminator (Fig. 1E), so we did not proceed to see the effect of Psu on the in vivo termination properties of this mutant. This result suggests that the primary RNA binding domain of Rho may be involved in the function of Psu. Purified Psu Protein—WT and different mutant psu genes were cloned in pET vector, and the proteins were purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 2, A and B). The purification method is described under “Experimental Procedures.” Δ-CTD10 migrated slower than WT Psu in SDS-PAGE. The circular dichroism spectrum of the WT Psu indicated that the secondary structure of Psu is predominantly α-helical in nature (Fig. 2C). The highly structured nature of the protein may be relevant for its function as a coat protein of the phage (8Isaksen M.L. Rishovd S.T. Calendar R. Lindqvist B.H. Virology. 1992; 188: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 9Dokland T. Isaksen M.L. Fuller S.D. Lindqvist B.H. Virology. 1993; 194: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Δ-CTD10 Psu also showed similar signature in CD (data not shown). Even though this deletion affected the migration in SDS-PAGE, it did not change the secondary structure of the protein. We next analyzed the oligomeric nature of this protein by glutaraldehyde cross-linking and passing the protein through Superose-6 gel filtration column. The cross-linking data indicated that under different salt concentrations the cross-linked species migrated as a dimer of Psu (Fig. 2D). Psu eluted as a single peak from the gel filtration column (Fig. 2E). The position of the peak corresponded to a molecular mass of ∼65 kDa, which indicated that the protein is a trimer. This position of elution corresponding to higher molecular mass than a dimer could also arise from its hydrodynamic shape. However, broadening of the base of the peak is suggestive of the presence of other oligomeric states. We also observed that both Psu M6 and Δ-CTD10 migrated as dimers after glutaraldehyde cross-linking (data not shown). So the lack of function of these mutants may not be because of the altered oligomeric state or secondary structure. Specific Rho·Psu Complex—We co-overexpressed a His-tagged Psu and WT Rho (non-His tagged) from two different pET vectors to demonstrate the direct interaction between Rho and Psu. Fig. 3A showed that co-overexpression of His-tagged WT Psu and WT Rho was lethal, whereas co-overexpression of C-terminal deletion variants of Psu and WT Rho was not lethal for the cells. It has been shown earlier that inhibition of cell growth is a direct consequence of the anti-Rho activity of Psu (12Linderoth N.A. Tang G. Calendar R. Virology. 1997; 227: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results suggest that also under this condition, Psu forms a specific functional complex with Rho in vivo and th"
https://openalex.org/W1968100942,"DNA ligase is an essential enzyme for all organisms and catalyzes a nick-joining reaction in the final step of the DNA replication, repair, and recombination processes. Herein, we show the physical and functional interaction between DNA ligase and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) from the hyperthermophilic Euryarchaea Pyrococcus furiosus. The stimulatory effect of P. furiosus PCNA on the enzyme activity of P. furiosus DNA ligase was observed not at low ionic strength, but at a high salt concentration, at which a DNA ligase alone cannot bind to a nicked DNA substrate. On the basis of mutational analyses, we identified the amino acid residues that are critical for PCNA binding in a loop structure located in the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of P. furiosus DNA ligase. We propose that the pentapeptide motif QKSFF is involved in the PCNA-interacting motifs, in which Gln and the first Phe are especially important for stable binding with PCNA.

DNA ligases catalyze nick-sealing reactions via three nucleotidyl transfer steps as described in recent review articles (1Tomkinson A.E. Mackey Z.B. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 2Doherty A.J. Suh S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 3Wilkinson A. Day J.

Rev. 2006; 106: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In the first step, DNA ligases form a covalent enzyme-AMP intermediate by reacting with ATP or NAD+ as a cofactor (Step 1). In the second step, DNA ligases recognize the substrate DNA, and the AMP is subsequently transferred from the ligases to the 5′-phosphate terminus of the DNA to form a DNA-adenylate intermediate (Step 2). Then, in the final step, the 5′-DNA-adenylate intermediate is attacked by the adjacent 3′-hydroxy group of the DNA to form a phosphodiester bond (Step 3). Three genes (LIG1, LIG3, and LIG4) encoding ATP-dependent DNA ligases have been identified in the human genome to date. Human DNA ligase I (Lig I) 2The abbreviations used are: Lig I, DNA ligase I; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PIP, PCNA-interacting protein; DBD, DNA-binding domain; PfuPCNA, P. furiosus PCNA; PfuLig, P. furiosus DNA ligase; DTT, dithiothreitol; CD, catalytic domain; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; RFC, replication factor C.2The abbreviations used are: Lig I, DNA ligase I; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PIP, PCNA-interacting protein; DBD, DNA-binding domain; PfuPCNA, P. furiosus PCNA; PfuLig, P. furiosus DNA ligase; DTT, dithiothreitol; CD, catalytic domain; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; RFC, replication factor C. is a replicative enzyme that joins Okazaki fragments during the DNA replication process. It is well known that many eukaryotic proteins involved in DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell cycle control interact with a DNA sliding clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (reviewed in Refs. 5Warbrick E. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 6Maga G. Hubscher U. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3051-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 7Vivona J.B. Kelman Z. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Extensive studies of the PCNA-interacting proteins revealed the existence of a consensus sequence called the PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) box (5Warbrick E. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The PIP box consists of the sequence QXXhXXaa, where X represents any amino acid, h represents hydrophobic residues (e.g. Leu, Ile, or Met), and a represents aromatic residues (e.g. Phe, Tyr, or Trp). Furthermore, it has been proposed that other sites of the interacting protein can participate in PCNA binding. For example, a conserved pair of Lys and Ala residues was identified as a PCNA-binding motif (KA box) using a random peptide display library (8Xu H. Zhang P. Liu L. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4512-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the importance of the KA box is not obvious because a detailed biochemical analysis of the motif has not been performed to date. In Escherichia coli, the corresponding DNA sliding clamp is the β-subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (henceforth referred to as the β-clamp), which forms a toroidal dimeric structure (9Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). A bioinformatics approach revealed that a pentapeptide motif (consensus QL(S/D)LF) plays an important role in binding to the β-clamp (10Dalrymple B.P. Kongsuwan K. Wijffels G. Dixon N.E.

A. 2001; 98: 11627-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).In higher eukaryotes, human Lig I reportedly forms a stable complex with a PCNA trimer that is topologically linked to duplex DNA via an N-terminal PIP box motif (11Levin D.S.

Motycka T.A. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A. Biamonti G. Tomkinson A.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3786-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The structures of eukaryotic DNA ligases can be divided into two major domains, an N-terminal non-catalytic domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain, which consists of an adenylation domain and an OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding)-fold domain (3Wilkinson A. Day J. Bowater R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 13Martin I.V. MacNeill S.A. Genome Biology. 2002; http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/4/reviews/3005PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of human Lig I in complex with a nicked DNA and biochemical analyses of the enzyme revealed that the non-catalytic domain provides most of the DNA binding affinity (14Pascal J.M. O'Brien P.J. Tomkinson A.E. Ellenberger T. Nature. 2004; 432: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and therefore, this domain is called the N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD). Although several groups have characterized the physical interactions between human Lig I and PCNA, no stimulatory or inhibitory effect on nick-joining activities has been observed in vitro (11Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12863-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 15Jonsson Z.O. Hindges R. Hubscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In contrast, a stimulatory effect of PCNA was also reported (16Tom S. Henricksen L.A. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24817-24825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, the detailed interaction mode between human PCNA and Lig I is somewhat unclear.In Archaea, the third domain of life, a single homolog of eukaryotic Lig I has been identified (17Kletzin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5389-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18Sriskanda V. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. Shuman S.

Shuman S. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6902-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although most of the archaeal replicative enzymes have a eukaryotic PIP box at their C termini, no clear PCNA-binding motif has been observed in the sequences of archaeal DNA ligases (5Warbrick E. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 22Grabowski B. Kelman Z. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 487-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Recently, a physical and functional interaction between PCNA and DNA ligase from Sulfolobus solfataricus was reported (23Dionne I. Nookala R.K. Jackson S.P. Doherty A.J. Bell S.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the S. solfataricus DNA ligase, PIP box-like motifs were proposed to exist in the N-terminal region. Furthermore, a mutant S. solfataricus DNA ligase lacking 30 amino acids at the N terminus cannot interact with S. solfataricus PCNA (23Dionne I. Nookala R.K. Jackson S.P. Doherty A.J. Bell S.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 24Dionne I. Bell S.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, it has not been determined whether the proposed motifs are actually important for the interaction with PCNA.Here, we show a physical and functional interaction between PCNA and DNA ligase from the hyperthermophilic Euryarchaea Pyrococcus furiosus. The stimulatory effect of P. furiosus PCNA (PfuPCNA) on the nick-joining reaction of P. furiosus DNA ligase (PfuLig) was observed under physiological conditions at an extremely high salt concentration (0.5–0.6 m). Furthermore, we show that the pentapeptide sequence QKSFF in the DBD of PfuLig plays an important role in binding to PfuPCNA. Interestingly, this motif is located in a loop connecting two α-helices in the DBD, but is not at the N or C terminus of PfuLig, based on our crystal structure. 3Nishida, H., Kiyonari, S., Ishino, Y., and Morikawa, K. (2006) J. Mol. Biol. 360, 956–967.3Nishida, H., Kiyonari, S., Ishino, Y., and Morikawa, K. (2006) J. Mol. Biol. 360, 956–967. We propose a novel PCNA-binding motif, which may be located inside, but not at the termini, of the PCNA-interacting proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning the PfuLig Gene and Its Mutants—The DNA ligase gene (lig) was amplified by PCR directly from P. furiosus genomic DNA using oligonucleotides 5′-GGCCATGGGTTATCTGGAGCTTGCTCAAC-3′ and 5′-GCGGATCCTTAGCTTTCCACTTTTCCTTTCATC-3′ as the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The amplified gene was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), and its nucleotide sequence was confirmed. The cloned gene was digested by NcoI-BamHI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pET-21d (Novagen). The resultant plasmid was designated pET-Lig. Amino acid substitutions and N-terminal truncations were introduced into the lig gene on the pET-Lig plasmid by PCR using the appropriate primers. 4Sequences are available upon request.Overproduction and Purification of PfuLig Proteins—To obtain recombinant PfuLig, E. coli BL21-CodonPlus™(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene) carrying pET-Lig were grown in 1 liter of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. The cells were cultured to A600 = 0.40, and expression of the lig gene was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm and continuing the culture for 5 h at 37 °C. After cultivation, the cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol). The soluble cell extract obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min was heated at 80 °C for 20 min. The heat-resistant fraction obtained by centrifugation was treated with 0.15% polyethyleneimine to remove the nucleic acids. The soluble proteins were precipitated by 80% saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was resuspended in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) and subjected to chromatography on a HiTrap phenyl column (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were eluted at 0 m ammonium sulfate, and the eluted proteins were dialyzed against buffer A. The dialysate was loaded onto a HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences), and the proteins were eluted at 0.3–0.35 m sodium chloride. The eluted proteins were dialyzed against buffer A, and the dialysate was subjected to chromatography on a HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were eluted at 0.1–0.15 m sodium chloride, pooled, and stored at 4 °C. The mutant PfuLig proteins prepared in this study were purified by the same procedures. The purity of each protein used in this study was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. No extra band was detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the gel containing 2 μg of each purified protein. The protein concentrations were calculated by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The theoretical molecular absorption coefficient of the molecule was calculated based on its tryptophan and tyrosine content.Preparation of the Deadenylylated Enzyme—Purified wild-type PfuLig protein (1.5 nmol) was incubated with an excess amount of pyrophosphoric acid (10 mm) in 150 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% Tween 20) at 37 °C for 1 h. The deadenylylated enzyme was purified by applying the reaction mixture to a MicroSpin G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer A.Adenylyltransferase Assay—Purified wild-type or K249A mutant PfuLig protein (15 pmol) was incubated with 0.05 μCi of [α-32P]ATP in 20 μl of reaction buffer at 55 °C for 20 min. T4 DNA ligase (9 units; Promega) was incubated with 0.05 μCi of [α-32P]ATP in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, and 5% polyethylene glycol (Mr cutoff of 8000) at 35 °C for 20 min. The products were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and scanned using a Fujifilm FLA5000 image analyzer to detect the Ado-[32P]DNA ligase adducts.DNA Ligation Assay—The substrate DNA used in the ligation assay was a 49-bp DNA duplex containing a single nick at the center. The 22-mer deoxynucleotide (5′-AATTCGTGCAGGCATGGTAGCT-3′), which was labeled with 32Patthe 5′ terminus, and the 27-mer deoxynucleotide (5′-AGCTATGACCATGATTACGAATTGCTT-3′) were annealed to the 49-mer deoxyoligonucleotide with a complementary sequence in 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.8) and 0.5 mm magnesium acetate. The purified PfuLig proteins (at different concentrations for each experiment, as described in the figure legends) were incubated with the nicked DNA substrate (5 nm), prepared as described above, in 20 μl of ligation buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.01 mm ATP, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 60 °C for 15 min. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme and terminated with 5 μl of stop solution containing 98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol. Samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and chilled rapidly on ice prior to loading onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and scanned using the FLA5000 image analyzer to detect the 32P-labeled DNA. Three independent experiments were carried out in succession for each ligation condition required in this study, and the S.E. values are shown as vertical lines on the plots in each graph.Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—A Biacore system was used to study the physical interaction between PfuLig and PfuPCNA. Highly purified recombinant PfuLig or PfuPCNA (25Cann I.K. Ishino S. Hayashi I. Komori K. Toh H. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6591-6599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was fixed on a CM5 sensor chip (research grade; Biacore) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To measure the kinetic parameters, various concentrations of PfuPCNA were applied to immobilized PfuLig. All measurements were performed at a continuous flow rate of 30 μl/min in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% Tween 20. At the end of each cycle, the bound protein was removed by washing with 2 m NaCl. The kinetic constants for PfuPCNA binding to PfuLig were determined from the association and dissociation curves of the sensorgrams using the BIAevaluation program (Biacore).RESULTSBiochemical Properties of PfuLig—PfuLig has already been characterized and is commercially available, mainly as a reagent for ligase chain reactions (Stratagene) (38Mathur E.J. Marsh E.J. Schoettlin W.E. 1996Google Scholar). In this study, we cloned and purified PfuLig independently and constructed mutant proteins to analyze the structure-function relationships of this enzyme. It was predicted from the primary amino acid sequence similarity that PfuLig is an ATP-dependent DNA ligase. Therefore, we constructed the mutant lig gene encoding K249A mutant PfuLig, in which the lysine at the predicted adenylylation site was substituted with alanine, in parallel with the gene for wild-type PfuLig and tested their adenylyltransferase activities in the presence of ATP. As shown in Fig. 1A, wild-type PfuLig could form a covalent enzyme-AMP intermediate by reacting with [α-32P]ATP as a cofactor, but no adenylyltransferase activity was observed with the K249A mutant protein. It was reported that some thermophilic DNA ligases from Archaea utilize ADP (26Jeon S.J. Ishikawa K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or NAD+ (19Nakatani M. Ezaki S. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6424-6433Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Rolland J.L. Gueguen Y. Persillon C. Masson J.M. Dietrich J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 236: 267-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a cofactor. However, we detected a distinct activity of PfuLig in the presence of ATP, but not ADP, AMP, and NAD+ (Fig. 1B). A very small amount of ligation product was detected by the reaction with ADP. This result is the same as in the case of DNA ligase from Pyrococcus horikoshii in a recent report (21Keppetipola N. Shuman S. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6902-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We think that the ligation reaction may be derived from contaminant ATP (1.16%) in our ADP reagent (Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's certificate, and therefore, we concluded that ADP is not an appropriate cofactor for PfuLig, as Keppetipola and Shuman (21Keppetipola N. Shuman S. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6902-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) described for P. horikoshii DNA ligase.Our crystallographic study of wild-type PfuLig revealed that the protein consists of three distinct domains, the N-terminal DBD, the middle adenylylation domain, and the C-terminal OB-fold domain.3 The last two domains are commonly called the core catalytic domain (CD), which is conserved in one branch of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily, containing DNA ligase, RNA ligase, and mRNA capping enzymes (reviewed in Ref. 4Tomkinson A.E. Vijayakumar S. Pascal J.M. Ellenberger T. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We made truncated PfuLig proteins, including the DBD from amino acids 1 to 218 (N-terminal domain) and the CD from amino acids 219 to 561 (middle and C-terminal domains) to investigate the functions of each domain (Fig. 1C). A nick joining assay was performed using the wild-type enzyme and the mutant PfuLig proteins (K249A, DBD, and CD) (Fig. 1D). The CD protein could not complete the nick-sealing reaction, even at high enzyme concentrations. A very small amount of ligation product was observed when the CD protein was added at a concentration 100-fold higher than that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 1D, CD lane). The accumulation of DNA-adenylate intermediate products implied that the CD protein exhibits a lower activity at the “Step 3” reaction. The CD protein shares a structural similarity with the full-length Chlorella virus DNA ligase, which is the smallest ATP-dependent DNA ligase with a distinct activity in vitro (28Ho C.K. Van Etten J.L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1931-1937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore, it is very interesting to investigate why the CD from PfuLig lacks most of the enzyme activity. This result indicates the importance of the DBD for the overall ligation activity of PfuLig, and it can be predicted from the structural similarity that the contribution of the DBD to the ligation reaction is also conserved in the eukaryotic DNA ligases.PfuLig Can Interact with Both Monomeric and Trimeric PCNA Proteins—To determine the physical interaction between PfuLig and PfuPCNA, we first used an immunoprecipitation method. The PfuPCNA and PfuLig proteins were incubated together and then precipitated by each antiserum. However, significant interactions between them were not detected under several experimental conditions, probably because the protein-protein interaction was too weak to be detected by an immunoprecipitation method (data not shown). We therefore performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments to analyze the weak DNA ligase-PCNA interactions. Full-length PfuLig was immobilized on the Biacore CM5 sensor chip, and subsequently, wild-type PfuPCNA and D143A/D147A mutant PfuPCNA, which is unable to form a stable toroidal structure in solution and thus cannot stimulate P. furiosus DNA polymerase B activity (29Matsumiya S. Ishino S. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), were injected at different concentrations. The physical interactions between immobilized PfuLig and the two PCNA proteins were identified by the SPR sensorgram (Fig. 2). The calculated equilibrium constants (KD) for wild-type PCNA and the D143A/D147A mutant were 1.1 × 10–7 and 1.4 × 10–6 m, respectively. The KD values reported here are comparable with that for the human PCNA-p21 interaction determined by SPR analysis (KD = 3.2 × 10–7 m) (30Knibiehler M. Goubin F. Escalas N. Jonsson Z.O. Mazarguil H. Hubscher U. Ducommun B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the toroidal structure is not necessarily required to form a stable PfuLig·PfuPCNA complex in vitro.FIGURE 2Physical interaction between PfuLig and PfuPCNA. SPR analysis was performed using a Biacore system to detect a physical interaction between PfuLig and PfuPCNA. Purified PfuLig was immobilized on a Biacore sensor chip, and purified PfuPCNA (3 μm) was loaded. Wild-type (WT) PfuPCNA and D143A/D147A mutant PfuPCNA, which cannot form a stable trimeric ring structure, were used to investigate their affinities for PfuLig. The equilibrium constant (KD) was calculated from the obtained sensorgram.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PfuPCNA Enhances the Ligation Activity of PfuLig at a Physiological Salt Concentration—It is well known that some hyperthermophilic Archaea contain strikingly high intracellular potassium ion concentrations. Based on the study of a Euryarchaea, Pyrococcus woesei, which was later proven to be a subspecies of P. furiosus (31Kanoksilapatham W. González J.M. Maeder D.L. DiRuggiero J. Robb F.T. Archaea. 2004; 1: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the potassium ion concentration in the hyperthermophilic archaeal cells was determined to range from 0.5 to 0.6 m (32Scholz S. Sonnenbichler J. Schafer W. Hensel R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We initially examined the effect of increasing salt concentrations on the nick-joining activity of PfuLig by supplementing the reaction with KCl and potassium glutamate salts. A reduction in ligation activity was observed with each of these monovalent salts in a concentration-dependent manner, and ∼90% inhibition was seen at a 200 mm salt concentration (Fig. 3A). A similar result was obtained in the enzyme assay using NaCl (data not shown). These observations are not specific for PfuLig, as the same phenomena were reported in characterizations of other DNA and RNA ligases (18Sriskanda V. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Rolland J.L. Gueguen Y. Persillon C. Masson J.M. Dietrich J. FEMS Microbiol.

A, comparison of ligation efficiencies at various KCl and potassium glutamate (K-Glu) concentrations in the reaction mixture as described under “Experimental Procedures” with 20 fmol of PfuLig and 100 fmol of nicked DNA in the absence of PfuPCNA. B and C, salt dependence of PfuPCNA-mediated stimulation of PfuLig activity. The ligation reactions of PfuLig (2 fmol) and the nicked DNA (100 fmol) were done with increasing concentrations of KCl (B) and potassium glutamate (C) in the presence or absence of PfuPCNA. The concentration of PfuPCNA was calculated as the trimeric form.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether PfuPCNA can stimulate the ligation activity of PfuLig at the physiological ionic strength, the proteins were assayed at a broad range of salt concentrations. The stimulation effect of PfuPCNA on PfuLig was observed at 0.05–0.2 m KCl, but the effect was decreased at >0.2 m KCl (Fig. 3B). We performed the enzyme assay in the same manner with potassium glutamate salt, which has been reported to be an important factor contributing to the thermostability of archaeal proteins (34Hethke C. Bergerat A. Hausner W. Forterre P. Thomm M. Genetics. 1999; 152: 1325-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, the stimulation effect was observed at >0.2 m potassium glutamate and peaked at 0.3–0.4 m, and residual activity was detected near the physiological potassium concentrations (0.5–0.6 m). Before comparison of the effects of KCl and potassium glutamate concentrations on the PfuPCNA-dependent ligation activity of PfuLig, the ligation reactions were performed with increasing concentrations of PfuPCNA at constant salt concentrations, and the appropriate concentrations of PfuPCNA for each reaction in the presence of KCl or potassium glutamate were determined (supplemental Fig. S1). These results show that a chloride ion (Cl–) concentration of >0.2 m, but not this concentration of potassium ion (K+), had an inhibitory effect on the enzyme activity of PfuLig. The same result was observed in the characterization of a Holliday junction-resolving enzyme, Hjc, from P. furiosus, which exhibits maximum enzyme activity at 0.2 m KCl (35Komori K. Sakae S. Fujikane R. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4544-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For the P. furiosus enzymes that catalyze nucleic acid modification reactions, high Cl– concentrations may affect their activity.A Novel PCNA-binding Site in the N-terminal DBD of PfuLig—To determine the region responsible for PCNA binding in PfuLig, we utilized the two truncation mutants (DBD and CD) as shown in Fig. 1C. The interactions between PfuPCNA and these truncated PfuLig proteins were examined qualitatively by SPR analysis. Wild-type PfuPCNA was immobilized on a Biacore CM5 sensor chip, and the two DNA ligase truncation mutants were then injected. Wild-type PfuLig and the DBD interacted with immobilized PfuPCNA to almost the same extent, but the CD had no binding ability (Fig. 4). This SPR analysis using immobilized PfuPCNA showed a very low number of resonance units compared with that shown in Fig. 2, in which PfuLig was immobilized. This phenomenon often happens in our experience of SPR analyses using PfuPCNA and its binding proteins. The difference probably depends on the direction of the proteins fixed on the sensor chip. Because of the relatively low number of resonance units (<250) observed in this experiment, the equilibrium constant (KD) was not determined. These findings suggest that the N-terminal DBD plays a critical role in the PCNA binding of PfuLig.FIGURE 4The N-terminal DBD of PfuLig is essential for PfuPCNA binding. Physical interactions with PfuPCNA were compared among the wild-type (WT) and two truncated (DBD and CD) PfuLig proteins using the Biacore system. Purified PfuPCNA was immobilized on a Biacore sensor chip, and purified PfuLig proteins (3 μm) were loaded in reverse to the experiment shown in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"
https://openalex.org/W2018554028,"Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) is an important component of the nucleotide salvage pathway in apicomplexan parasites and a potential target for drug development. The intracellular pathogen Toxoplasma gondii was therefore tested for sensitivity to immucillins, transition state analogs that exhibit high potency against PNP in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Growth of wild-type T. gondii is unaffected by up to 10 μm immucillin-H (ImmH), but mutants lacking the (redundant) purine salvage pathway enzyme adenosine kinase are susceptible to the drug, with an IC50 of 23 nm. This effect is rescued by the reaction product hypoxanthine, but not the substrate inosine, indicating that ImmH acts via inhibition of T. gondii PNP. The primary amino acid sequence of TgPNP is >40% identical to PfPNP, and recombinant enzymes exhibit similar kinetic parameters for most substrates. Unlike the Plasmodium enzyme, however, TgPNP cannot utilize 5′-methylthio-inosine (MTI). Moreover, TgPNP is insensitive to methylthio-immucillin-H (MT-ImmH), which inhibits PfPNP with a Ki* of 2.7 nm. MTI arises through the deamination of methylthio-adenosine, a product of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway, and its further metabolism to hypoxanthine involves PfPNP in purine recycling (in addition to salvage). Remarkably, analysis of the recently completed T. gondii genome indicates that polyamine biosynthetic machinery is completely lacking in this species, obviating the need for TgPNP to metabolize MTI. Differences in purine and polyamine metabolic pathways among members of the phylum Apicomplexa and these parasites and their human hosts are likely to influence drug target selection strategies.

Targeting T. gondii PNP alone is unlikely to be efficacious for treatment of toxoplasmosis. The phylum Apicomplexa consists of >5000 species of obligate intracellular parasites and is responsible for many important diseases in humans and other animals. Malaria (caused by Plasmodium) is a serious global problem with mortality rates in excess of 1 million a year (1Greenwood B. Mutabingwa T. Nature. 2002; 415: 670-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Toxoplasma gondii is a chronic infection estimated to affect ∼30% of the world's population and poses a significant threat to immunocompromised individuals and congenitally infected children (2Hill D. Dubey J.P. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 2002; 8: 634-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The emergence of drug-resistant malaria parasites and complications associated with long-term treatment of chronic toxoplasmosis underscore the need for new chemotherapeutic agents. Focusing on differences between host and parasite metabolism provides an attractive strategy for identifying potential drug targets. One metabolic discrepancy between apicomplexan parasites and their mammalian hosts is the lack of de novo purine biosynthesis in the former, making them completely reliant on host cells for these essential nutrients (3Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Parasites. Academic Press, London1995: 323-336Crossref Google Scholar). Apicomplexan purine salvage pathways have been explored using a combination of biochemical, genetic, and genomic studies (4Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Berens R.L. J. Biol.

Comparative analysis reveals two alternative, and functionally redundant, salvage routes for purine assimilation by Eimeria and Toxoplasma. Adenosine kinase (AK) 3The abbreviations used are: AK, adenosine kinase; AK-, AK knockout T. gondii parasites; HXGPRT, hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase; Imm, immucillin; MTA, 5′-methylthio-adenosine; MTAP, methylthioadenosine phosphorylase; MTI, 5′-methylthio-inosine; MT-ImmH, 5′-methylthio-immucillin-H; PNP, purine nucleoside phosphorylase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; TgPNP, T. gondii; PfPNP, P. falciparum; EcPNP, E. coli PNP.3The abbreviations used are: AK, adenosine kinase; AK-, AK knockout T. gondii parasites; HXGPRT, hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase; Imm, immucillin; MTA, 5′-methylthio-adenosine; MTAP, methylthioadenosine phosphorylase; MTI, 5′-methylthio-inosine; MT-ImmH, 5′-methylthio-immucillin-H; PNP, purine nucleoside phosphorylase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; TgPNP, T. gondii; PfPNP, P. falciparum; EcPNP, E. coli PNP. converts the nucleoside adenosine into the nucleotide AMP, and hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HXGPRT) converts guanylate nucleobases into nucleotides, including GMP (see “Discussion”). Cryptosporidium and Theileria rely on AK alone, while only HXGPRT is present in Plasmodium, but the ability to enzymatically inter-convert AMP and IMP provides all of these parasites with a supply of all necessary purine nucleotides. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) converts inosine to hypoxanthine and guanosine to guanine, providing an important source of nucleobases for HXGPRT (3Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Parasites. Academic Press, London1995: 323-336Crossref Google Scholar). PNPs have been examined in a variety of species (12Pugmire E.J. Ealick S.E. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may be grouped into two main families: trimeric forms (such as the human enzyme) are typically ∼31 kDa and prefer 6-oxopurines (e.g. inosine, guanosine), and hexameric PNPs (such as the Escherichia coli enzyme) are ∼26 kDa and active against both 6-oxopurines and 6-aminopurines (e.g. adenosine). P. falciparum PNP (PfPNP) has been characterized in detail, and although its amino acid sequence is most similar to hexameric PNPs, its substrate is distinct from either family (10Kicska G.A.

In particular, PfPNP is able to utilize 5′-methothioinosine (MTI), produced by the action of adenosine deaminase on methothioadenosine (MTA), a byproduct of polyamine metabolism. The involvement of PfPNP in both purine and polyamine pathways makes this enzyme an attractive drug target, and rationally designed PNP inhibitors (immucillins) inhibit both parasite and host erythrocyte enzymes to produce purine-less death of P. falciparum parasites (11Ting L.M.

This report describes the cloning, recombinant expression, and characterization of T. gondii PNP (TgPNP) and comparison with PfPNP. Although broadly similar, TgPNP lacks activity against methylthio-purines. Surprisingly, examination of the T. gondii genome (15Kissinger J.C. Gajria B. Li L. Paulsen I.T. Roos D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) indicates the absence of polyamine biosynthetic machinery in this parasite. Parasites, Host Cells, Chemicals, and Reagents—RH strain T. gondii tachyzoites and adenosine kinase knock-out (AK-) mutants (7Sullivan Jr., W.J. Chiang C.W. Wilson C.M. Naguib F.N. el Kouni M.H. Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were maintained by serial passage in primary human foreskin fibroblasts (16Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Immucillins were generously provided by Drs. Peter C. Tyler, Gary B. Evans, and Richard H. Furneaux (Industrial Research Ltd., Lower Hutt, New Zealand), and Dr. Vern L. Schramm (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx NY). [3H]uracil (20 Ci mmol-1) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Xanthine oxidase and all purine substrates were obtained from Sigma. DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Sensitivity of T. gondii to ImmH and Rescue by Purine Nucleobases—The growth of intracellular T. gondii (wild-type and AK- mutants) was measured in 24-well plates containing confluent human foreskin fibroblast cell monolayers by the incorporation of [3H]uracil into acid-precipitable material. Parasites were grown for 24 h in the presence of varying concentrations of ImmH (0-100 μm), after which the cultures were subjected to a 4-h pulse of [3H]uracil (5 μCi; 20 Ci mmol-1) and plates were processed as previously described (16Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). For metabolic rescue experiments, AK- parasites were inoculated into 96-well plates containing 10 μm ImmH plus various concentrations of hypoxanthine or xanthine (0-100 μm) for 4 days. The disruption of host cell monolayers (an indicator of parasite viability) was measured by crystal violet staining and optical density measurements at 650 nm (16Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar).

Based on the most significant match in the T. gondii genome obtained when PNP sequences were used as query, the following primers were constructed for 5′- and 3′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) using the SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto CA): 5′-GCTGCCCGGGTACTTCGATCGCC-3′ (sense primer for 3′-RACE); 5′-GGCACAGACCGAGGACACCGGAC-3′ (antisense primer for 5′-RACE). T. gondii tachyzoite cDNA was synthesized from total cellular RNA prepared using the RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA), and the complete TgPNP open reading frame was amplified using sense primer 5′-acatgcATGCAGGGCATGGAAGTTCAGCCTC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-cgggatccGTACTGGCGACGCAGATTC-3′ (uppercase indicates native coding sequence; restriction sites underlined). The PCR product was gel purified (Qiagen Gel Extraction kit), digested with SphI and BglII, ligated into appropriately digested pQE-70 plasmid (Qiagen), and its sequence verified. The resulting construct (pQE-TgPNP-His6) encodes TgPNP in-frame with a C-terminal His6tagunderthecontrolofanisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible promoter. A second putative nucleoside phosphorylase was also identified and cloned from T. gondii (see supplemental materials) and has been shown to function as a UdP (not shown). Nucleoside phosphorylase amino acid sequences obtained from GenBank™ were aligned with T. gondii nucleoside phosphorylases (TgPNP and TgUdP) using ClustalX (18Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35074) Google Scholar). Unambiguously aligned sequences were used to construct phylogenetic trees using the neighbor-joining method (19Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) and subjected to bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates (20Hillis D. Bull J. Syst. Biol. 1993; 42: 182-192Crossref Scopus (3630) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of TgPNP—E. coli strain M15[pREP4] (Qiagen) was transformed with the pQE-TgPNP-His6 plasmid and grown at 37 °C in 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. Expression of His-tagged protein was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the culture A600 reached 0.6, and cells were harvested 5 h later by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 20 min. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced, TgPNP-transformed E. coli cells were resuspended and sonicated in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mg ml-1 lysozyme) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysate was then cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) was added to the cleared lysate, mixed gently for 1 h, packed into a column, and washed twice with 4 ml of wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole). Tagged protein was then released with elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole) and estimated to be >95% pure based on denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Blue. Protein concentration was measured using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Enzyme Assays—All PNP assays were performed with purified enzyme in 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.4. Phosphorylysis of inosine, 2-deoxyinosine, and 5′-methylthio-inosine was measured in a coupled assay with 115 milliunits ml-1 xanthine oxidase to convert hypoxanthine into uric acid. Uric acid formation was followed by spectrophotometric measurement at 293 nm (E293 = 12.9 mm-1 cm-1). Guanosine phosphorylysis was monitored by measuring the disappearance of guanosine at 258 nm (E258 = 5.2 mm-1 cm-1). Adenosine and 5′-methylthio-adenosine phosphorylase activities were measured by following the disappearance of the substrate at 274 nm (E256 = 1.9 mm-1 cm-1). Uridine phosphorylase activity was measured by following the conversion of uridine to uracil at 272 nm (E260 = 2.9 mm-1 cm-1). For inhibition assays, excess substrate (0.5 mm) was used in combination with inhibitor ranging from 0 to 10 μm; the concentration of inhibitor was always at least 10-fold greater than the enzyme concentration. The rapidly reversible inhibition of PNP was analyzed by fitting to the equation v0 = (kcat × S)/(Km (1 + I/Ki) + S), where v0 is the initial reaction rate, kcat the maximal catalytic rate, S the substrate concentration, Km the Michaelis constant, I the inhibitor concentration, and Ki the dissociation constant for the enzyme-inhibitor complex. Because transition state mimics typically exhibit a slow-onset tight binding inhibition (21Schramm V.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 693-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), reaction rates were measured continuously to monitor for a second phase with a markedly different steady state rate vs, in which case Ki*(the dissociation constant for steady state following slow-onset inhibition) was assessed by fitting to vs = (kcat × S)/(Km (1+I/Ki*) + S). Immucillin-H Inhibits the Growth of AK- Parasites but Not Wild-type T. gondii—Immucillins are transition state inhibitors that exhibit potent activity against mammalian and P. falciparum PNPs (14Kicska G.A.

Bagdassarian C.K. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8615-8621Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). ImmH kills P. falciparum in culture with an IC50 of 35 nm, with the mode of action dependent on inhibition of both Plasmodium and erythrocyte PNP (14Kicska G.A. Tyler P.C. Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Schramm V.L. Kim K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3226-3231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast, wild-type RH strain T. gondii parasites (WT) are insensitive to 100 μm ImmH (Fig. 1A). Parasites lacking the purine salvage enzyme adenosine kinase (AK-) exhibit a dose-dependent inhibition of growth, however, with an IC50 value of 23 ± 9 nm. (Inhibition of host cell PNP is also expected at this concentration, as ImmH inhibits human PNP with a Ki of 72 pm.) The difference in sensitivities between wild-type and AK- parasites is consistent with previous observations on the redundancy of purine salvage pathways in T. gondii (8Chaudhary K. Darling J.A. Fohl L.M. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Donald R.G. Pfefferkorn E.R. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31221-31227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar): this parasite can survive by salvaging either adenosine (via AK) or hypoxanthine (via HXGPRT). AK- parasites are dependent on HXGPRT, which may depend on PNP activity as a source of nucleobases. To determine whether ImmH exerts its effect by targeting T. gondii PNP (as opposed to the host enzyme or another target), we assayed the ability of hypoxanthine and xanthine to rescue drug-treated AK- parasites, as shown in Fig. 1B. Both of these nucleobases were able to rescue AK- parasites from the inhibitory effects of 10 μm ImmH. For example, 25 μm hypoxanthine restored parasite viability to 75% of the levels observed without ImmH treatment, and 25 μm xanthine restored parasite viability to 60% of control levels. In contrast, incubation with up to 100 μm concentrations of the nucleoside inosine was unable to rescue AK- parasites from the effects of ImmH (not shown). These data strongly suggest that ImmH acts by inhibiting T. gondii PNP directly. Identification of T. gondii PNP—Similarity searches using sequences from other species to interrogate the T. gondii genome data base identified a single significant match to the P. falciparum (10Kicska G.A.

Genome Res. 2003; 13: 2178-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (3947) Google Scholar) also identified another putative nucleoside phosphorylase in the T. gondii genome based on significant similarity to E. coli uridine phosphorylase (26Morgunova E.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (see supplemental Fig. S1). Preliminary enzymatic characterization (not shown) indicates that this gene exhibits UdP activity. The full-length cDNA sequence for TgPNP was obtained by 5′- and 3′-RACE and predicts a 247-amino acid protein of molecular mass 26,803 Da. Alignment of TgPNP with related enzymes shows 39% average similarity to the hexameric PNPs (Family 1, including bacterial PNPs and UdPs) versus 21% similarity to trimeric PNPs, (Family 2, including mammalian PNPs and eukaryotic MTAPs). TgPNP exhibits 41% sequence identity to PfPNP and 27% identity to EcPNP (Fig. 2). Phylogenetic analysis also associates the apicomplexan PNPs with Family 1, as TgPNP and PfPNP cluster more closely with UdPs than with any of the PNPs (Fig. 3). TgUdP is an outlier, not grouping strongly with other UdPs or PNPs.FIGURE 3Phylogeny reconstruction for PNP, UdP, and MTAPs.

The remaining three sites are conserved within the Apicomplexa but differ from EcPNP. Asp-206 in PfPNP and Asp-207 in TgPNP probably correspond to Asp-204 in EcPNP, which has been proposed to be the general acid/base for N7 protonation of the substrate purine ring (13Shi W. Ting L.M.

The crystal structure of PfPNP complexed with the transition state analog MT-ImmH reveals that the methylthio group nestles within a hydrophobic pocket formed by Val-66, Tyr-160, and Met-183 from one subunit and His-7 and Val-73 from a neighboring subunit of the PfPNP hexamer. It is interesting to note that despite the overall similarity of apicomplexan PNPs, three conservative substitutions (Ile-68, Ile-75, and Phe-162) render the methylthio binding pocket of TgPNP more similar to EcPNP, which does not possess activity against MTI. 4L. M. Ting and K. Kim, unpublished observations. Expression, Purification, and Biochemical Characterization of TgPNP—Recombinant TgPNP engineered to contain a C-terminal hexahistidine tag was overexpressed and purified from bacteria using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column under native conditions (Fig. 4). On a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, the protein ran as a single band close to its predicted molecular mass of 27 kDa. The protein was stored in elution buffer (see “Materials and Methods”) at 4 °C with minimal loss of activity over a period of 3 months. Among the various substrates tested against recombinant TgPNP, the highest catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) were observed for phosphorylysis of inosine (1.98 × 105 mol-1 s-1) and guanosine (3.83 × 105 mol-1 s-1) as shown in Table 1. The kinetic parameters determined for these substrates were most similar to those observed in PfPNP, with a turnover rate ∼10-fold lower than reported for Homo sapiens PNP and EcPNP. Deoxynucleosides, which serve as substrates for mammalian PNPs, showed very poor catalytic efficiency using either parasite PNP, and virtually no activity was detected against adenosine or uridine (substrates for EcPNP and EcUdP, respectively). Although MTI is readily transformed by PfPNP, this purine is not an effective substrate for TgPNP, with a catalytic efficiency <0.5% than that for inosine.

NMR spectroscopy experiments using perdeuterated CIB1 together with heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effect experiments have revealed a well folded α-helical structure for both the ligand-free and αIIb-bound forms of the protein. Residual dipolar coupling experiments have shown that the N and C domains of CIB1 are positioned side by side, and chemical shift perturbation mapping has identified the αIIb-binding site as a hydrophobic channel spanning the entire C domain and part of the N domain. Data obtained with a truncated version of CIB1 suggest that the extreme C-terminal end of the protein weakly interacts with this channel in the absence of a biological target, but it is displaced by the αIIb cytoplasmic domain, suggesting a novel mechanism to increase binding specificity.

The platelet-specific heterodimeric transmembrane integrin receptor αIIbβ3 plays a central role in hemostasis and thrombosis (1Ni H. Freedman J. Transfus. Apher. Sci. 2003; 28: 257-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). At the site of vascular injury, platelet agonists such as thrombin trigger “inside-out” signaling events that activate αIIbβ3, resulting in ligand binding by the integrin extracellular domains, integrin cross-linking, and ultimately, platelet aggregation. Ligand occupancy also generates “outside-in” signals that lead to granular secretion of ADP, cytoskeletal reorganization, and platelet spreading (2Ginsberg M.H. Partridge A. Shattil S.J. Curr. Opin.

The binding of CIB1 to synthetic αIIb peptides can occur in vitro with a dissociation constant in the high nanomolar range (7Shock D.D. Naik U.P. Brittain J.E. Alahari S.K. Sondek J. Parise L.V. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8Yamniuk A.P. Vogel H.J. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1429-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); however, the mechanistic details of the interaction are not well understood. Because inappropriate platelet activation is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease (9Behan M.W. Storey R.F. Postgrad. Med. J. 2004; 80: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), understanding the interaction between CIB1 and αIIb could be an important step toward the development of novel anti-platelet therapeutics. CIB1 shares significant sequence homology with calcineurin B (CnB), calcineurin homologous protein-1, and the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family of EF-hand proteins. Like these proteins, CIB1 is myristoylated on its N-terminal glycine residue and is membrane-associated in vivo (10Barry W.T. Boudignon-Proudhon C. Shock D.D. McFadden A. Weiss J.M. Sondek J.

Recent x-ray crystal structures (Protein Data Bank codes 1XO5 and 1Y1A) have shown that like its homologs, calcium-bound CIB1 (Ca2+-CIB1) folds into N- and C-terminal globular domains, each composed of two EF-hand motifs, with extended N- and C-terminal regions (12Blamey C.J. Ceccarelli C. Naik U.P. Bahnson B.J. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1214-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Gentry H.R. Singer A.U. Betts L. Yang C. Ferrara J.D. Sondek J. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8407-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ca2+ is bound to the canonical C domain EF-hands (EF-III and EF-IV) but not to the divergent N domain EF-hands (EF-I and EF-II), consistent with biochemical studies (14Yamniuk A.P. Nguyen L.T. Hoang T.T. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2558-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the core dual helix-loop-helix EF-hand structure of Ca2+-CIB1 is very similar in both 1XO5 and 1Y1A, there are distinct differences in the protein's oligomeric state, the orientation of the two domains, and the conformation of the N- and C-terminal extensions (supplemental Fig. 1). In 1XO5, Ca2+-CIB1 was crystallized as a monomer with similar domain orientation to CnB, calcineurin homologous protein-1, and the NCS proteins (13Gentry H.R. Singer A.U. Betts L. Yang C. Ferrara J.D. Sondek J. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8407-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). CIB1 is also monomeric in solution as revealed by diffusion NMR spectroscopy (15Weljie A.M. Yamniuk A.P. Yoshino H. Izumi Y. Vogel H.J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), sedimentation equilibrium, and gel filtration studies (13Gentry H.R. Singer A.U. Betts L. Yang C. Ferrara J.D. Sondek J.

Pol. 2005; 52: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, in 1Y1A the protein was crystallized as a head-to-tail dimer, with a different domain orientation and structurally distinct N- and C-terminal extensions (12Blamey C.J. Ceccarelli C. Naik U.P. Bahnson B.J. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1214-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The structure of the N-terminal extension is important since it would affect the placement of the myristoyl group and orientation of CIB1 with respect to the cytoplasmic membrane. The structure of the C-terminal extension is interesting because in each crystal structure it shields the C domain hydrophobic channel that had previously been proposed to be the αIIb-binding site based on mutagenesis and molecular modeling data (10Barry W.T.

Vogel H.J. J. Mol. Recognit. 2000; 13: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study we have utilized solution NMR spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy and microcalorimetry of CIB1, and truncated CIB1 proteins to investigate the solution structure of Ca2+-CIB1 and characterize its interaction with an acetylated synthetic peptide (αIIb-L) encompassing the entire αIIb cytoplasmic domain and part of the transmembrane domain (Ac-LVLAMWKVGFFKRNRPPLEEDDEEGQ-OH). Our data reveal the structural characteristics of peptide-free and peptide-bound Ca2+-CIB1 in solution and reveals a novel binding mode for the αIIb cytoplasmic domain, in which the C-terminal extension of CIB1 plays an important role in controlling binding specificity. Protein Expression and Purification—Wild type histidine10-tagged-CIB1 (herein referred to as CIB1) was expressed in Escherichia coli strain ER2566 (New England Biolabs) from a pET19b vector (Novagen) as previously described (14Yamniuk A.P. Nguyen L.T. Hoang T.T. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2558-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The total protein construct is 213 residues long (24 kDa) including the 23 residue N-terminal tag. 15N- and 13C,15N-labeled CIB1 were expressed from the same bacterial strain in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl and either 3 g/liter unlabeled glucose or 3 g/liter [13C]glucose, respectively. Perdeuteration required that the bacterial strain be first acclimatized to M9 minimal media with increasing percentages of D2O (0, 30, 60, 99.9%) (18Gardner K.H. Kay L.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 357-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 19Shan X. Gardner K.H. Muhandiram D. Rao N. Arrowsmith C. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 6570-6579Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). 2H,13C,15N-Labeled CIB1 was ultimately expressed in 99.9% D2O medium containing [13C]glucose and 15NH4Cl. All proteins were purified by Ni2+-Sepharose affinity chromatography (14Yamniuk A.P. Nguyen L.T. Hoang T.T. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2558-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and concentrations were determined using the predicted molar extinction coefficient (ϵ276 = 2900). Mass spectrometry revealed that the level of perdeuteration was ∼87%. Generation of Mutant CIB1 Proteins—The CIB1ΔH10 construct was generated by introducing a stop codon (TGA) in place of the Ser-180 codon (AGC) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the forward and reverse primers 5′-CAGCATGTGATCAGCCGCTGACCAGATTTTGCGAGC-3′ (FWD) and 5′-GCTCGCAAAATCTGGTCAGCGGCTGATCACATGCTG-3′ (REV). The coding region for residues 96-191 of CIB1 was amplified from the CIB1-pET19b template using PCR and the primers 5′-AGATTTTCTGGATCATATGAGCGTGTTTAGCG-3′ (FWD) and 5′-TTAGCAGCCGGATCCTCACAGCAC-3′ (REV). The purified PCR product and empty pET19b expression vector were each digested with NdeI and BamHI (New England Biolabs) and then ligated using T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) to generate the CIB1-C-pET19b construct. The integrity of both constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and each protein was purified to homogeneity identically to wild type CIB1. Concentrations were determined using the predicted molar extinction coefficient for CIB1ΔH10 (ϵ276 = 2900), and CIB1-C (ϵ276 = 1450). Peptides—All peptides were synthesized commercially and determined to be more than 95% pure by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy and high pressure liquid chromatography. Peptide αIIb-L (Ac-LVLAMWKVGFFKRNRPPLEEDDEEGQ-OH) corresponds to amino acids 983-1008 of the platelet integrin αIIb subunit, with Gln-1008 as the C-terminal residue (20Calvete J.J. Schafer W. Henschen A. Gonzalez-Rodriquez J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Peptide H10p (Ac-SPDFASSFKIVL-OH) corresponds to residues 180-191 of CIB1. Peptide smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase smMLCKp (Ac-ARRKWQKTGHAVRAIGRLSS-NH2) is the calmodulin (CaM)-binding site of chicken smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase, encompassing amino acids 36-55. The concentration of each peptide was determined using their predicted molar extinction coefficients: αIIb-L, ϵ280 = 5690; H10p, ϵ258 = 390; smMLCKp, ϵ280 = 5690. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker AVANCE 500 MHz or 700 MHz NMR spectrometers equipped with either a triple resonance inverse cryoprobe with single axis z gradient or triple-axis gradient triple broad band inverse detection (TBI) probe. Samples used for resonance assignments contained 650 μm 2H,13C,15N-labeld CIB1 in 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm d10-dithiothreitol (d10-DTT), 3 mm CaCl2, 10% D2O, ∼0.5 mm NaN3, pH 7.5 ± 0.1, with and without 720 μm (1.1 molar equivalent) αIIb-L. Sequence-specific assignments of the 1HN, 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C, and 15N resonances for Ca2+-CIB1 and Ca2+-CIB1 in complex with αIIb-L were obtained manually using 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra and a combination of transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY)-based triple-resonance experiments including three-dimensional HNCACB, HN(CA)CO, HN(CO)CACB, and HNCO experiments (21Eletsky A.

Proton chemical shifts were referenced to the internal standard, 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate, and both 13C and 15N were referenced indirectly (24Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar). Spectral analysis was performed using NMRPipe/NMRDraw (25Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11520) Google Scholar) and NMRView (26Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2676) Google Scholar) software, and chemical shift values were corrected for shifts induced by TROSY and perdeuteration (27Shan X. Gardner K.H. Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. Arrowsmith C.H. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of Ca2+-CIB1 alone and in complex with αIIb-L was determined using the weighted average secondary shift method, where the chemical shift deviation from random coil for the backbone Cα, C, and N nuclei are normalized to the random coil range for each nucleus, and then averaged (Equation 1).WASS=13[(δCα-δCαr)+1.7(δC-δCr)+0.35(δN-δNr)](Eq. 1) Chemical shift changes between Ca2+-CIB1 and the Ca2+-CIB1-αIIb-L complex were analyzed using the chemical shift perturbation (CSP) method described by Wingfield and co-workers (28Grzesiek S. Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Hu J.S. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), but for illustrative purposes the contributions of the HN and N nuclei are displayed separately from the contribution of the Cα and Cβ nuclei (Equation 2).CSP=(ΔHN)2+(ΔN/5)2+(ΔCα/2)2+(ΔCβ/2)2(Eq. 2) {1H}-15N NOE experiments were acquired at 310 K and 700 MHz with and without 1H saturation using a recycle delay of 4.5 s (29Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). Samples consisted of 600 μm 15N-labeled CIB1 in 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm d10-DTT, 3 mm CaCl2, 10% D2O, ∼0.5 mm NaN3,pH7.5 ± 0.1, with and without 660 μm αIIb-L. {1H}-15N NOE data were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe/NMRDraw and NMRView software, with a noise floor of 7 and 10% for Ca2+-CIB1 and Ca2+-CIB1-αIIb-L, respectively. 1H,15N backbone dipolar couplings were measured at 310 K and 700 MHz using a sensitivity-enhanced IPAP-type 1H,15N HSQC experiment (30Cordier F. Dingley A.J. Grzesiek S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Isotropic samples contained 650 μm 15N-labeled CIB1 in 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm d10-DTT, 3 mm CaCl2, 10% D2O, ∼0.5 mm NaN3,pH7.5 ± 0.1, and aligned samples contained 500 μm 15N-labeled CIB1 in the same buffer plus 12 mg/ml Pf1 phage (Asla Biotech). Data processing and analysis were performed using NMRPipe/NMRDraw, NMR-View, and PALES software (31Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3791-3792Crossref Scopus (596) Google Scholar). In the PALES analysis the correlation between residual dipolar couplings (RDC) data and a protein structure is given by the correlation coefficient (R) and the quality factor (Q), which each range from 0 to 1, with a better correlation represented by higher R values and lower Q values. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—All isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed on a MicroCal VP-ITC microcalorimeter. Protein preparation included an overnight incubation in 10 mm DTT to reduce any disulfide bonds and subsequent DTT removal by gel filtration as previously described (14Yamniuk A.P. Nguyen L.T. Hoang T.T. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2558-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Titrations consisted of sequential injections of 300-500 μm CIB1, CIB1ΔH10, or CIB1-C in 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, into a sample cell containing 10-20 μm αIIb-L or H10p in the same buffer at temperatures ranging from 20 to 37 °C. The non-linear heat of dilution exhibited by CIB1ΔH10 required the subtraction of a complete reference experiment for each peptide titration at all temperatures. Titrations of 400 μm smMLCKp into 20 μm CIB1 or CIB1ΔH10 were also performed under similar conditions. All data were fit to a one-site binding model using MicroCal Origin software to obtain values for the stoichiometry (N), association constant (Ka), and enthalpy change (ΔH), whereas values for the entropy change (TΔS) and change in heat capacity (ΔCp) were calculated using standard thermodynamic equations. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Steady state 8-anilino-1-naphalenesulfonate (ANS) fluorescence spectra were recorded at 37 °C on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter using samples of 40 μm ANS in 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5 ± 0.1, with and without 10 μm CIB1 or CIB1ΔH10. Samples were excited at 370 nm using 5 nm excitation slits, and steady state fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 400 to 600 nm at a scan rate of 600 nm/min using 10-nm emission slits. NMR Characterization of Ca2+-CIB1—Using TROSY-based triple resonance NMR spectroscopy experiments, we were able to obtain nearly complete assignments of the HSQC spectrum of Ca2+-CIB1, representing 88% of the expected backbone signals for the native polypeptide sequence (supplemental Fig. 2, A and C). Most of the amino acid residues that could not be detected were from solvent-exposed loops or at the N terminus, which is predicted to be solvent-exposed and flexible due to the high glycine and serine content in this region (13Gentry H.R. Singer A.U. Betts L. Yang C. Ferrara J.D. Sondek J. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8407-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, the signals for these residues are probably broadened by conformational exchange and/or the rapid amide hydrogen exchange that occurs with solvent H2O under these conditions (pH 7.5, 37 °C). We note that lowering the experimental pH or temperature reduced protein solubility and spectral quality, and no additional signals could be detected at higher temperatures (data not shown). A strong correlation between backbone chemical shift values and protein secondary structure is well established (32Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar, 33Wishart D.S. Nip A.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the chemical shift data to predict the secondary structure of Ca2+-CIB1 in solution. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the NMR data confirmed that Ca2+-CIB1 is highly α-helical and composed of four EF-hand motifs. Both of the canonical Ca2+ binding EF-hand motifs in the C domain (EF-III and EF-IV) show the expected helix-loop-helix structure with a short β-strand in the center of each Ca2+ binding loop. EF-II within the N domain also displays the typical helix-loop-helix structure, whereas the more divergent EF-I consists of a long α-helix (H1) and then a mixture of short helical segments (H2, H3a, and H3b) and connecting loops. Importantly, an N-terminal α-helix (H0) from K10-D18 is clearly observed in the NMR data, similar to crystal structure 1Y1A. The C-terminal extension adopts a short α-helical segment from Asp-182—Ser-185 followed by an extended conformation from Ser-186 —Leu-191, which is also similar to the secondary structure observed in 1Y1A. However, the signals for most of the extreme C terminus (Phe-187—Leu-191) displayed greater than average line-broadening, suggesting that these residues might be partially solvent-exposed or in chemical exchange between multiple conformations (supplemental Fig. 2A). The backbone flexibility of Ca2+-CIB1 was further examined using {1H}-15N NOE experiments. This analysis revealed that almost the entire protein backbone has flexibility consistent with typical well folded globular domains, having average {1H}-15N NOE values near ∼0.8 (Fig. 1C). This includes the residues within the short central linker between the N and C domains, suggesting that the two domains might adopt a fixed orientation in solution. The most flexible region of the protein is the loop connecting EF-III and EF-IV, which also has very high temperature factors in the crystallographic data (12Blamey C.J. Ceccarelli C. Naik U.P. Bahnson B.J. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1214-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Gentry H.R. Singer A.U. Betts L. Yang C. Ferrara J.D. Sondek J. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8407-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The {1H}-15N NOE values also decrease toward the C terminus, suggesting increased mobility, but unfortunately the signals for the last three residues (I189-L191) could not be analyzed in the {1H}-15N NOE data due to chemical exchange broadening. Domain Orientation of Ca2+-CIB1 Revealed by Residual Dipolar Couplings—To determine the N and C domain orientation of Ca2+-CIB1 in solution, we measured one-bond backbone 1H,15N RDC and compared the results to the RDC predicted from crystal structures 1XO5 and 1Y1A (Fig. 2, Table 1). Analysis of the entire protein backbone revealed a much better correlation between the NMR data and the RDC predicted from crystal structure 1XO5 in comparison to 1Y1A. However, a good correlation was observed when the N and C domains of either 1XO5 or 1Y1A were analyzed separately. This suggests that the poor overall correlation with 1Y1A is due to a difference in domain orientation rather than domain structure and that the domains of Ca2+-CIB1 are oriented side by side in solution, similar to the monomeric crystal form, 1XO5.TABLE 1Correlation between the residual dipolar couplings determined by solution NMR spectroscopy and those calculated from the x-ray crystal structures of Ca2+-CIB1, 1XO5, and 1Y1A A better agreement is represented by a higher correlation coefficient (R) and lower quality factor (Q).Region analyzed1XO51Y1ARQRQFull protein (1–191)0.900.430.600.80ΔH0 (24–191)0.960.270.610.80ΔH10 (1–179)0.910.420.600.81ΔH0/ΔH10 (24–179)0.970.240.600.81N domain (1–99)0.870.490.890.45N domain ΔH0 (24–99)0.970.230.900.43C domain (105–191)0.950.290.960.29C domain ΔH10 (105–179)0.970.240.970.25 Open table in a new tab Omitting the N-terminal extension from the analysis significantly improves the correlation between the NMR data and 1XO5 but not 1Y1A (Table 1). This confirms that the N-terminal extension adopts an α-helical structure (H0) and orientation similar to 1Y1A rather than the extended conformation observed in 1XO5, which is also consistent with the secondary structure analysis. Omitting the C-terminal extension from the analysis of the C domain improves the correlation with each crystal structure only marginally. However, only three residues were available for RDC analysis in this region (Ser-180, Ser-186, Val-190) due to overlap and low signal intensity, making it difficult to exclude the conformation observed in either of the crystal structures. Considering the aforementioned chemical exchange in this region, it is also possible that the C-terminal extension simply exhibits some conformational flexibility. NMR Characterization of the Ca2+-CIB1-αIIb-L Complex— The complex of Ca2+-CIB1 with the αIIb-L peptide produced NMR spectra of similar quality to the peptide-free protein and, consequently, also required perdeuteration and TROSY to obtain resonance assignments (supplemental Fig. 2B). Most of the residues that did not give rise to HSQC signals in peptide-free Ca2+-CIB1 were also not observed in the presence of the αIIb-L peptide, indicating that peptide binding does not alter the exchange in these regions of the protein (supplemental Fig. 2C). The chemical shift analysis also revealed that the secondary structure of Ca2+-CIB1 remains intact in complex with αIIb-L (Fig. 3A), which is typical for EF-hand proteins in complex with their targets (34Anglister J. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, the {1H}-15N NOE data showed similar backbone flexibility (or lack thereof) for α-helices H0-H9, their connecting loops, and all four short β-strands (Fig. 3B). The one distinct difference that is observed upon peptide binding is that the NMR signals for much of the C-terminal extension (Asp-182, Phe-183, Ser-185—Lys-188) become broadened beyond detection, suggesting that this region undergoes conformation exchange on the intermediate NMR timescale. Moreover, the previously exchange-broadened signals for Ile-189, Val-190, and Leu-191 at the extreme C terminus dramatically increase in intensity and display very small or negative {1H}-15N NOE values (-0.3-0.1) characteristic of a high degree of conformational flexibility (Fig. 3). Therefore, these data indicate that αIIb-L binding significantly increases the flexibility of the C-terminal extension of Ca2+-CIB1. Identification of the αIIb-binding Site on Ca2+-CIB1—To further characterize the regions of Ca2+-CIB1 that are affected by αIIb-L binding, CSP analysis was performed. This analysis demonstrated that αIIb-L binding has the largest effect on non-polar residues of Ca2+-CIB1, consistent with the predominantly hydrophobic interaction predicted from previous experiments (7Shock D.D.

The largest CSP values were generally to residues from the C domain, especially residues on the hydrophobic face of H6, H7, and H8, as well as most of H9 and the C-terminal extension (Fig. 4). However, significant changes were also observed in regions of the N domain, suggesting that both domains interact with the peptide. In the N domain the largest CSP values were within the loop between H0 and H1, Arg-33, and H3a/H3b as well as the C-terminal end of H5. Mapping the CSP data onto the structure of Ca2+-CIB1 localizes the αIIb-binding site to the face of each domain that is opposite to the Ca2+ binding loops (functional and non-functional) (Fig. 4, B and C). H5 and residues from H3a/H3b form a small hydrophobic pocket on the surfac"

DNA damage-induced cell death can be mediated by a p53-dependent or p53-independent pathway. Although p53-mediated apoptosis has been well documented, little is known about the signaling components of p53-independent cell death. Here we report that the death domain kinase, RIP (receptor-interacting protein), is important for DNA damage-induced, p53-independent cell death. DNA damage induces cell death in both wild-type and p53–/– mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. We found that RIP–/– mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, which have a mutant form of the p53 protein, are resistant to DNA damage-induced cell death. The reconstitution of RIP protein expression in RIP–/– cells restored the sensitivity of cells to DNA damage-induced cell death. We also found that RIP mediates this process through activating mitogen-activated protein kinase, JNK1. Furthermore, knocking down the expression of RIP blocked DNA damage-induced cell death in the human colon cancer cell line, p53 null HCT 116.

In response to genotoxic stress, such as ionizing radiation, UV radiation, and a variety of DNA-alkylating agents, the p53 protein is stabilized and activated. Induction of p53 leads to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or senescence, which results in limited cell proliferation (3Zhan Q. Carrier F. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell.

Although the molecular mechanism of p53-mediated apoptosis has been well documented, little is known about the signaling components of the p53-independent necrotic cell death in response to DNA damage.

Although RIP is not required for TNF/FasL-induced apoptosis, RIP has been found to be essential for TNF/FasL or reactive oxygen species-induced necrotic cell death (10Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O.

It has been suggested that JNK activation may play a role in TNF or reactive oxygen species-induced necrotic cell death (12Shen H.M. Lin Y. Choksi S. Tran J. Jin T. Chang L. Karin M. Zhang J.

Although JNK is activated by a variety of genotoxic stress, the molecular mechanism that mediates DNA damage-induced JNK activation remains elusive. Our previous studies found that RIP plays an essential role in DNA damage-induced NF-κB activation and in oxidative stress-induced cell death (12Shen H.M. Lin Y. Choksi S. Tran J. Jin T. Chang L.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the involvement of RIP in DNA damage-induced cell death with RIP null MEF cells. We report here that RIP is essential for DNA damage-induced, p53-independent cell death. We also demonstrated that RIP mediates this process through activating JNK. Reagents—Anti-JNK-1 and anti-p53 antibodies were purchased from Pharmingen; anti-RIP antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories; anti-mutant p53 antibody was from Oncogene Science. Anti-actin antibody, Ara-C, and CHX were purchased from Sigma; Adr, Cpt, and SP600125 were from Calbiochem. Anti-TNF-R1 and recombinant mTNF-α were purchased fromR&D Systems. Protein A-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. RIP-specific and control double-stranded small interfering RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell Culture and Treatment—All MEF and HCT 116 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The RIP-reconstituted cells, RIP–/–, were cultured in the same medium, including 300 μg/ml hygromycin (17Hur G.M. Lewis J. Yang Q. Lin Y. Nakano H. Nedospasov S. Liu Z.G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The RIP-reconstituted cell line was established by ectopically expressing Myc-tagged RIP protein in RIP–/– MEFs. To do so, RIP–/– cells were co-transfected with a Myc-RIP plasmid and a hygromycin selection plasmid. Then RIP expression in RIP–/– cells was confirmed by Western blotting. Western Blot Analysis—After treatment with different reagents as described in the figure legends, cells were collected and lysed in M2 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Fifty micrograms of the cell lysates was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted. The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence, according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences). Verification of p53 Status—Identification of mutated p53 protein in cells was achieved by immunoprecipitation of mutant p53 with the monoclonal antibody pAb240, which specifically recognizes mutant forms of p53 under nondenaturing conditions. Immunoprecipitants were examined by Western blotting with an anti-p53 antibody, pAb122, which recognize both wild-type and mutant p53 under denaturing conditions. The cDNA of p53 gene was cloned from the total RNAs purified with RIP–/– cells using RNAzol B reagent (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Reverse transcription-PCR was carried out with sense (5′-gcacctagcattcaggc-3′) and antisense (5′-cataagacagcaaggag-3′) primers according to the protocol provided, and the PCR products were purified and ligated into pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega). The sequence of the cloned cDNA was obtained by autosequencing and compared with the one of wild-type p53 gene (cited from the NCBI data base, accession number AAH05448). Small Interfering RNA Knockdown of RIP—p53–/– HCT 116 cells were plated in 12-well plates, and cells were transfected with either a RIP-specific double-stranded small interfering RNA oligonucleotide (RIP-siRNA, 150 μmol/well) or a control small interfering RNA (150 μmol/well) with no known homology to mammalian genes using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). After 48 h of incubation, the transfected cells were lysed, and the efficiency of RIP knockdown was analyzed by Western blotting. JNK Kinase Assay—Cells were collected and lysed in M2 buffer. JNK1 was immunoprecipitated with the anti-JNK1 antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads by incubation at 4 °C for 4 h to overnight. The beads were washed with lysis buffer, and the kinase assay was then performed in complete kinase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 50 μm sodium vanadate, 20 μm ATP) with the addition of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of GST-c-Jun-(1–79), as substrate. After 20 min at 30 °C, sample buffer was added, and proteins were resolved in 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and phosphorylated substrates were visualized by autoradiography. Detection of Cell Death—Cell death of various MEF cells was quantified using a cytotoxicity detection kit, which measures the percentage of lactate dehydrogenase leakage, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Bioscience). Briefly, 25 μl of culture medium was used for each assay, and 25 μl of reaction mixture was added to each sample. After 10–20 min of incubation, each sample was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. RIP Has a Critical Role in p53-independent Cell Death Induced by DNA Damage—DNA damage can induce cell death through p53-dependent or independent pathways (6Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 7Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 20Gudkov A.V. Komarova E.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To test whether p53 is required for cell death induced by different DNA-damaging agents other than MNNG (7Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), several commonly used DNA-damaging agents such as adriamycin (Adr), camptothecin (Cpt), and 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) were employed in our experiments. These agents cause DNA damage through different mechanisms of action. Wild-type (WT) and p53 null MEF were used to examine the role of p53 in cell death induced by these DNA-damaging agents. As shown in Fig. 1A, all of these DNA-damaging agents, Adr, Cpt, and Ara-C, induced cell death in WT and p53 null MEFs very efficiently, even though the extent of cell death in p53 null cells is slightly less than wild-type cells. These results indicate that these agents can induce cell death by a p53-independent pathway in MEF cells. Consistent with the previous study (7Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), we found that caspase activation is not required for cell death induced by these DNA-damaging agents in p53 null cells because all of the caspase inhibitors we tested, including benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD, Boc-D, and the poxvirus protein Crm A, failed to block the cell death (data not shown). In our earlier studies, we found that RIP plays an essential role in DNA damage-induced NF-κB activation and reactive oxygen species-induced caspase-independent cell death (12Shen H.M. Lin Y. Choksi S. Tran J. Jin T. Chang L. Karin M. Zhang J. Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5914-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 17Hur G.M. Lewis J. Yang Q. Lin Y. Nakano H. Nedospasov S. Liu Z.G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Hence, we addressed whether RIP is involved in DNA damage-induced cell death by using RIP null (RIP–/–) MEF cells. Because p53 is often mutated during establishing MEF cell lines, we first examined the status of p53 in the RIP–/– MEF cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, whereas the basal level of p53 is undetectable in nontreated wild-type MEF cells, the induction of p53 protein is first detected at 1 h after treatment with Adr, and the level of p53 protein continued to accumulate as examined at different time points following treatment. In contrast, the basal level of p53 protein in RIP–/– cells was significantly increased, and there was no detectable induction of p53 protein following Adr treatment. Similar results were observed when cells were treated with other DNA-damaging agents such as Cpt (Fig. 1B, bottom panel) and Ara-C (data not shown). The protein levels of RIP and actin were checked as controls (Fig. 1B). Because it is known that p53 protein is stabilized when mutated and the protein level of the mutated p53 does not increase in response to DNA damage (21Blagosklonny M.V. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1889-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), our results in Fig. 1B imply that the p53 protein is a mutant form in RIP–/– MEF cells. To further confirm this conclusion, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with a monoclonal antibody, which only recognizes mutant p53 protein. Immunoprecipitants from wild-type and RIP–/– cells following Adr treatment were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with the p53 antibody used in Fig. 1B, which recognizes both wild-type and mutant p53 proteins. As shown in Fig. 1C, the same amount of p53 protein was immunoprecipitated from different samples of RIP–/– cells regardless of treatment, indicating that p53 was mutated and not induced in response to DNA damage in these cells. However, as expected, no detectable level of p53 protein was immunoprecipitated from any sample of wild-type cells even though high levels of p53 protein were induced after Adr treatment (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). Hence, the p53 protein in RIP–/– MEF cells is a mutant one. We further confirmed this conclusion by sequencing the cDNA sequence of p53 gene cloned from RIP–/– MEF cells. We found that residue 129 of p53 protein in RIP–/– cells is mutated from a lysine to an arginine. We then examined the role of RIP in DNA damage-induced cell death with RIP–/– cells. Surprisingly, as shown in Fig. 1D, when RIP–/– cells were treated with DNA-damaging agents, Adr, Cpt, or Ara-C, these cells were dramatically resistant to cell death as compared with wild-type cells and p53–/– cells. Because the p53 protein is mutated in RIP–/– cells, these results indicate that RIP may have an essential role in DNA damage-induced, p53-independent cell death. To rule out the possibility that the presence of mutant p53 protein interferes with DNA damage-induced cell death in RIP–/– cells or that there is some defect in the DNA damage-induced cell death pathway in RIP–/– cells, we tested whether DNA damage-induced cell death could be restored in these cells by ectopically expressing RIP (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, the reconstitution of RIP expression in RIP–/– cells significantly restored the sensitivity of these cells to Adr- or Cpt-induced cell death. Importantly, the restoration of RIP expression in RIP–/– cells did not have any effect on the protein level of p53 following Adr or Cpt treatment (Fig. 2C). Thus, these results suggested that the mutated p53 in RIP–/– cells is unlikely to be responsible for the resistance of these cells to DNA damage-induced cell death and that the absence of RIP causes the failure of cell death in response to DNA damage. Taken together, RIP has a crucial role in DNA damage-induced, p53-independent cell death in MEF cells. To test whether this finding can be extended to other types of cells, particularly some human cancer cells, we examined the sensitivity of the p53 null human tumor cell line, HCT 116 (p53–/–) to different DNA-damaging agents before and after RIP protein expression is knocked down. The p53–/– HCT 116 cell line is an isogenic line, derived from the original colon epithelial carcinoma HCT 116 cells, in which p53 has been deleted by homologous recombination (22Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2527) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, despite the difference of p53 status in these two types of cells, both the HCT 116 and the p53-null HCT 116 cells are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents, Adr-, Cpt-, or Ara-C-induced cell death, and have similar sensitivity. However, when p53 protein expression is knocked down by a RIP siRNA in p53 null HCT 116 cells (Fig. 3C), the sensitivity of these cells to DNA damage-induced cell death is significantly reduced (Fig. 3D). These results imply that RIP protein also plays a critical role in DNA damage-induced cell death in the p53 null human carcinoma HCT 116 cells. The Requirement of RIP in DNA Damage-induced, p53-independent Cell Death Is Not Linked to TNFR1 Signaling—Previous studies have suggested that DNA damage could induce the expression of death receptors such as Fas or the release of TNF (23Waring P. Mullbacher A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 24Petak I. Houghton J.A. Pathol. Oncol. Res. 2001; 7: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because it is known that RIP is required for Fas or TNF-mediated necrotic cell death (10Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immun. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 11Lin Y. Choksi S. Shen H.M. Yang Q.F. Hur G.M. Kim Y.S. Tran J.H. Nedospasov S.A. Liu Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10822-10828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), it is important to explore the possibility that the requirement of RIP in DNA damage-induced cell death is because of the increased presence of these death mediators. First we tested whether the blockage of de novo protein synthesis using the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX has any effect on DNA damage-induced cell death in p53–/– cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, the presence of CHX did not effect the cell death induced by Adr treatment in p53–/– cells, although CHX does effectively inhibit protein synthesis as indicated by the protein level of the short half-life protein c-Myc (data not shown). Therefore, it is unlikely that a de novo synthesized death receptor or factor plays a major role in this process. To rule out the possibility that TNF signaling could be engaged by the release of pre-existing TNF in response to DNA damage (24Petak I. Houghton J.A. Pathol. Oncol. Res. 2001; 7: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we examined DNA damage-induced cell death in TNFR1–/– MEF cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, the treatment of Adr, Cpt, or Ara-C resulted in a similar susceptibility to cell death in WT and TNFR1–/– cells, whereas TNF plus CHX failed to initiate TNF-induced cell death in TNFR1–/– cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the RIP-mediated cell death induced by DNA damage was not achieved through TNF signaling. We also examined whether DNA damage-induced cell death requires FADD protein, which is a key effector of Fas and TNF-induced apoptosis. We found that FADD protein is not essential for DNA damage-induced cell death and JNK activation by using FADD–/– MEFs (Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, RIP and FADD protein do not interact following DNA damage (Fig. 5C). RIP cleavage and ubiquitination during TNF-induced apoptosis has been reported by us and others. However, we did not observe any RIP degradation or ubiquitination following DNA damage (Fig. 1, B and C, and Fig. 5C). These observations further indicate that the role of RIP in DNA damage-induced cell death is distinct from its role in TNF-induced apoptosis. RIP Mediates DNA Damage-induced Cell Death through Activating JNK—It has been reported that JNK activation is critical for TNF-induced necrotic cell death (15Ventura J.J. Cogswell P. Flavell R.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2905-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 16Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to investigate whether JNK activation plays any role in DNA damage-induced cell death. Because JNK is only activated by certain classes of DNA-damaging agents (13Karin M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 14Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3611) Google Scholar), we examined JNK activation in response to Adr and Cpt in wild-type MEF cells and the possible role of RIP in JNK activation with RIP–/– cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, left panels, both Adr and Cpt activate JNK potently in wild-type MEF cells. However, JNK activation by Adr or Cpt is severely impaired in RIP–/– cells (Fig. 6A, right panels), indicating that RIP is needed for DNA damage-induced JNK activation. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that reconstitution of RIP expression in RIP–/– cells significantly restores JNK activation in response to Adr or Cpt (Fig. 6B). DNA damage-induced JNK activation is independent of p53 because JNK is activated normally in p53–/– cells (data not shown). Next, we sought to determine whether DNA damage-induced, RIP-mediated JNK activation contributes to cell death in response to DNA damage by using JNK1–/– cells. As shown in Fig. 6C, when cells were treated with Adr, Cpt, or Ara-C, JNK1–/– cells were found to be much more resistant to cell death as compared with wild-type or p38–/– cells. These results suggested that JNK is involved in DNA damage-induced cell death. This observation was further confirmed by experiments using the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125. The pre-treatment of SP600125 led to a significant suppression of cell death induced by Adr or Cpt in WT and p53–/– cells (data not shown). Therefore, these results suggest that RIP-mediated JNK activation is likely the pathway that is responsible for DNA damage-induced cell death. p53 mutation is one of the most common genetic abnormalities in cancer, and loss of p53 function is associated with pronounced resistance of cancer to chemotherapeutic agents (1Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 1995; 2: 594-604Crossref Scopus (2703) Google Scholar, 25Branch P. Masson M. Aquilina G. Bignami M. Karran P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3138-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Improving the efficiency of chemotherapeutic agents in cancer cells with mutant p53 protein will have a significant impact on cancer treatment. The findings by Zong et al. (7Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) indicated that alkylating DNA-damaging agents induce p53-independent necrosis-like cell death, suggesting the possibility for using DNA-damaging agents to kill cancer cells through a p53-independent pathway. Therefore, it is critical to understand the molecular basis of this p53-independent pathway. In this study, we identified RIP-mediated JNK activation as the signaling pathway to regulate DNA damage-induced cell death independently of p53, and we provided a potential mechanism for this process. RIP is a critical effector molecule of TNF signaling and is essential for TNF-induced JNK and NF-κB activation (8Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 26Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z.G. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we showed that RIP also plays a pivotal role in DNA damage-induced NF-κB activation (17Hur G.M. Lewis J. Yang Q. Lin Y. Nakano H. Nedospasov S. Liu Z.G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that RIP mediates p53-independent, DNA damage-induced cell death. The involvement of RIP in DNA damage-induced cell death does not require TNFR1 signaling. RIP fulfills its function in DNA damage-induced cell death through mediating JNK activation. Recently, Janssens et al. (27Janssens S. Tinel A. Lippens S. Tschopp J. Cell. 2005; 123: 1079-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) reported that the death domain protein PIDD functions upstream of RIP in DNA damage-induced NF-κB activation. It will be interesting to see whether PIDD has a similar function in DNA damage-induced cell death. DNA damage can induce cells to undergo apoptosis or necrosis. However, alkylating DNA damage causes necrotic cell death, and this process is p53- and caspase-independent (7Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In our study, we found that DNA damage-induced cell death in RIP–/– cells does not require caspase activation and has a necrotic morphology (data not shown). Because p53 is mutated in RIP–/– cells, the cell death we observed in those cells is p53-independent, necrosis-like cell death. Although it is still not understood how RIP senses the death signal of DNA damage, our study clearly establishes RIP as a key regulator of cell death in response to DNA damage and raises the possibility that RIP could function as a tumor suppressor. Especially, because many types of cancer cells are resistant to chemotherapies despite there being two distinct death pathways in response to DNA damage, it is of great importance to examine the status of the RIP/JNK pathway in addition to p53 protein in cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2094431635,"Degradation of activated ERBB receptors is an important mechanism for signal attenuation. However, compared with epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, the ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling pair is considered to be attenuation-deficient. The ERBB2/ERBB3 ligands of the neuregulin family rely on an EGF-like domain for signaling and are generated from larger membrane-bound precursors. In contrast to EGF, which is processed to yield a 6-kDa peptide ligand, mature neuregulins retain a variety of segments N-terminal to the EGF-like domain. Here we evaluate the role of the N-terminal domain of neuregulin 1 in signaling and turnover of ERBB2/ERBB3. Our data suggest that whereas the EGF-like domain of neuregulin 1 is required and sufficient for the formation of active receptor heterodimers, the presence of the N-terminal Ig-like domain is required for efficient signal attenuation. This manifests itself for both ERBB2 and ERBB3 but is more pronounced and coupled directly to degradation for ERBB3. When stimulated with only the EGF-like domain, ERBB3 shows degradation rates comparable with constitutive turnover, but stimulation with full-length neuregulin 1 resulted in receptor degradation at rates that are comparable with activated EGF receptor. Most of the enhancement in down-regulation was maintained after replacing the Ig-like domain with a thioredoxin protein of comparable size but different amino acid composition, suggesting that the physical presence but not specific properties of the Ig-like domain are needed. This sequence-independent effect of the N-terminal domain correlates with an enhanced ability of full-size neuregulin 1 to disrupt higher order oligomers of the ERBB3 extracellular domains in vitro.

The ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases is involved in a broad spectrum of growth control and cell differentiation events. Members of this receptor family in humans include the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, 2The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ECD, extracellular domain; NRG, neuregulin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. ERBB1), ERBB2 (HER2/Neu), ERBB3 (HER3), and ERBB4 (HER4) (1Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5670) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ERBB receptors is associated with a number of solid tumor malignancies and often results in constitutive activation and uncontrolled growth regulation (2Dougall W.C. Qian X.

Science. 1989; 244: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (6289) Google Scholar). Controlled signaling by ERBB receptors is initiated by binding of a ligand to preformed or ligand-induced dimers, and ERBB receptors can form various combinations of homodimers and heterodimers. The heterodimer composed of ERBB2 and ERBB3 is the most potent pair in terms of stimulating cell proliferation (7Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). ERBB2 is unique in that no ligand has been identified that binds directly to its extracellular domains (ECDs). However, ERBB2 exhibits the strongest cytoplasmic kinase activity of the ERBB receptors (8Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A.

In contrast, ERBB3 has a catalytically deficient kinase domain, but its ECDs bind many isoforms of the neuregulin (heregulin) family of ligands with high affinity (10Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). In addition, ERBB3 has a high propensity to self-associate, and oligomers of ERBB3 are destabilized by the binding of neuregulin, thereby favoring the formation of signaling-competent heterodimers with ERBB2 (11Landgraf R. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8503-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Kani K. Warren C.M. Kaddis C.S. Loo J.A. Landgraf R. J. Biol.

Bracke M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2004; 21: 665-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All NRG ligands share an EGF-like domain, which is both necessary and sufficient for binding to and activating ERBB receptors (14Lu H.S. Chang D. Philo J.S. Zhang K. Narhi L.O. Liu N. Zhang M. Sun J.

Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The EGF-like domain of NRG1 ligands has been shown to be structurally highly homologous to EGF (16Jacobsen N.E. Abadi N. Sliwkowski M.X. Reilly D. Skelton N.J. Fairbrother W.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3402-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). NRG1 and NRG2 ligands bind to both ERBB3 and ERBB4, whereas NRG3 and NRG4 only bind to and activate ERBB4 (17Jones J.T. Akita R.W. Sliwkowski M.X.

More than 15 NRG1 isoforms, which result from alternative splicing of a single gene, have been identified (19Falls D.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 14-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). These isoforms can be divided into three types (I, II, or III), based on their N-terminal segments (Fig. 1A). NRG1 ligands of type I (heregulin; Neu differentiation factor; acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity (ARIA)) contain an Ig-like domain and a glycosylation-rich segment (15Holmes W.E.

Type II isoforms (glial growth factor) also contain an Ig-like domain but lack the glycosylation-rich segment (23Marchionni M.A. Goodearl A.D. Chen M.S. Bermingham-McDonogh O. Kirk C. Hendricks M.

Nature. 1993; 362: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Type III isoforms (sensory and motor neuron-derived factor) lack both the Ig-like domain and glycosylation-rich segment but contain a cysteine-rich domain of a size comparable with the Ig-like domains of type I and II NRG1s (24Ho W.H. Armanini M.P. Nuijens A. Phillips H.S. Osheroff P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Variations in the C-terminal portion of the EGF-like domain of NRG1 differentiate subtypes (α, β1, β2, β3) and convey preferential binding to either ERBB3 or ERBB4. All data presented here use recombinant and nonglycosylated NRG1-β1 with or without N-terminal domains. This subtype is known to bind preferentially to ERBB3. NRG1 isoforms are either generated from short transcripts leading to directly secreted ligands or are synthesized as transmembrane precursor proteins (14Lu H.S. Chang D. Philo J.S. Zhang K. Narhi L.O. Liu N. Zhang M. Sun J. Wen J. Yanagihara D. Karunagaran D. Yarden Y. Ratzkin B. J. Biol.

The result is a soluble NRG1 ligand containing both the N-terminal segments and the EGF-like domain, equivalent to NRG1 ligands obtained by direct secretion. However, direct activation of cells through cell-cell contacts between receptor-expressing cells and cells expressing membrane-bound NRG1 has also been demonstrated (26Aguilar Z. Slamon D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44099-44107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For comparison, EGF is also synthesized as a 190-kDa transmembrane precursor protein that, in contrast to NRG1, undergoes cleavage both N-terminal and C-terminal to the EGF domain, producing a small peptide ligand (∼6 kDa) for EGFR (27Bell G.I. Fong N.M. Stempien M.M. Wormsted M.A. Caput D. Ku L.L. Urdea M.S. Rall L.B. Sanchez-Pescador R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8427-8446Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 28Gray A. Dull T.J.

Pept. 2004; 122: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). An exception for EGFR ligands is heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor. Similar to NRGs, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor retains a 45-amino acid N-terminal domain with heparan sulfate binding affinity (30Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). To better distinguish the different NRG1 ligands used in this paper, and unless a general reference to the NRG1 ligand is intended, we will refer to NRG1 containing the Ig-like domain as Ig-NRG1 and refer to the EGF-like domain of NRG1 as NRG1176, denoting the N terminus of this artificial peptide ligand (Fig. 1C). The EGF-like domain of NRG-1 has been reported to be sufficient for the basic activation of ERBB2/ERBB3 heterodimers. Furthermore, the similarity of NRG1176 to EGF in terms of size and structure underscores the structural and functional similarities between their target receptors, EGFR, ERBB3, and ERBB4. As a result, most studies involving NRG1 have been carried out using NRG1176 or comparable peptide ligands. However, the N-terminal segments of NRG1 are consistently retained in all isoforms in vivo, with the exception of a small fraction of NRG1 type III, which undergoes an additional cleavage event, leaving an N-terminal portion of reduced size. This suggests that the retention of the N-terminal segments of NRG1 may reflect a functional conservation despite wide variability of these N-terminal domains on the primary sequence level. One example of a functional benefit conferred by the N-terminal Ig-like domain has been reported for NRG1-β1 stimulation of acetylcholine receptor transcription in myotubes (31Li Q. Loeb J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38068-38075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, the ability of the Ig-like domain to bind heparan sulfates facilitates the enrichment of ligand on the cell surface, resulting in an enhanced growth stimulation response at low ligand concentrations. Following initial activation events, ligand-induced internalization and degradation of receptor-ligand complexes serves as an important mechanism for attenuating receptor-mediated signaling alongside nondegradative processes, such as dephosphorylation by phosphatases. In response to receptor activation, EGFR and EGF are rapidly internalized through the endocytic pathway and are sent to lysosomes for degradation (32Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 33Sorkin A. Waters C.M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4 have been reported to display impaired internalization compared with EGFR and hence to show reduced signal attenuation. A study comparing the EGF-driven endocytosis of EGFR with chimeras containing the extracellular domain of EGFR fused to the cytoplasmic domains of either ERBB2, ERBB3, or ERBB4 showed that the chimeras internalized 125I-labeled EGF at a much slower rate than EGFR (34Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Using the EGF-like domain of NRG1 as a ligand, the rate of NRG1 endocytosis in cells expressing various combinations of ERBB receptors was reported to be much slower than the internalization rate of EGF in cells expressing EGFR (7Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 35Baulida J. Carpenter G. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we evaluate the role of the N-terminal segment of NRG1 with respect to receptor activation, heterodimerization, and down-regulation of ERBB3 and ERBB2. We show that whereas the initial dimerization and phosphorylation events are comparable for Ig-NRG1 and NRG1176, the presence of the Ig-like domain is important in accelerating the removal of activated ERBB3 and ERBB2, primarily through enhanced degradation in the case of ERBB3, thus conferring enhanced signal attenuation to the ERBB2/ERBB3 system. The enhanced down-regulation observed for Ig-NRG1 was also observed with an unrelated N-terminal fusion protein of similar size, indicating that the physical presence but not the amino acid composition of the Ig-like domain is responsible for its effect on receptor down-regulation. In an in vitro assay, the presence of domains N-terminal to the EGF-like domain of NRG1 correlates with enhanced destabilization of ERBB3 oligomers. We propose that the N-terminal domains of NRG1 ligands, maintained in different variations, are functionally conserved and are required to improve signal attenuation in the otherwise attenuation-deficient ERBB2/ERBB3 system. Reagents and Cell Culture—Recombinant human NRG1-β1 (Ig-NRG1) and the EGF-like domain of NRG1-β1 (NRG1176) were obtained from R & D systems. Thioredoxin and a fusion protein of the EGF-like domain of NRG1-β1 with thioredoxin (Trx-NRG1) was generated in a pET-32a vector (Novagen) and purified as described previously (11Landgraf R. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8503-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Antibodies, conjugates, and detection reagents were obtained as follows: ERBB2 (Neu C-18), ERBB3 (C-17 and conjugates) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10 and conjugates) from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); anti-V5-HRP from Invitrogen; S-protein-agarose resin and S-protein-HRP conjugate from Novagen; anti-phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (α-pERK1/2) antibody from Cell Signaling Technology; and anti-His5-HRP antibody from Qiagen. Sulfo-N-hydroxy-succinimido-LC-Biotin, streptavidin-agarose resin, and bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) were obtained from Pierce. MCF7 cells from American Type Culture Collection were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Tyrosine Phosphorylation Assays—MCF7 cells were seeded at 250,000 cells/well in a 6-well plate and then serum-starved in RPMI 1640 for 16 h, 24 h after seeding. Following serum starvation, cells were stimulated with NRG1176, Ig-NRG1, Trx-NRG1, or Trx + NRG1176 with either increasing concentrations of ligand (0-900 nm) in RPMI 1640 at 37 °C for 30 min or with a fixed concentration of 10 nm ligand for 0-240 min as indicated in Fig. 3. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were either evaluated directly for tyrosine phosphorylation by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis or immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine-agarose resin after a 1:10 dilution of SDS lysates in mild lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride), followed by Western blot analysis of ERBB2 and ERBB3. Autoradiograms were quantified using densitometry analysis. Co-immunoprecipitations—MCF7 cells were seeded at 1,600,000 cells/100-mm dish and then serum-starved in RPMI 1640 for 16 h, 24 h after seeding. Cells were then stimulated with 10 nm NRG1176 or Ig-NRG1 for 30 min at 4 °C. Following simulation, cells were washed with PBS, lysed in mild lysis buffer, and further homogenized by five passages through a 26-gauge needle. Following incubation at 37 °C for 5 min to ensure the disruption of Triton-resistant lipid fractions and mild sonication, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with 200 μg of lysate with 30 μl of a slurry of the anti-ERBB3 (C-17)-agarose resin. The immunoprecipitated material was washed three times with 10 ml of cold mild lysis buffer and eluted from the resin with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE, immunoblot analysis was performed with anti-ERBB2 and anti-ERBB3 as the primary antibodies and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP as the secondary antibody. Cell Surface Biotinylation—MCF7 cells were prepared as described under “Tyrosine Phosphorylation Assays.” Following a 3-h serum starvation or without starvation, cells were pretreated with 10 nm NRG1176 or Ig-NRG1 or left untreated in RPMI 1640 with or without 10% FBS for 30 min at 4 °C. After two washes with PBS containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-CM), the cells were labeled with 1 mg/ml Sulfo-N-hydroxy-succinimido-LC-Biotin in either PBS-CM or RPMI 1640 + 10% FBS containing 10 nm ligand two times for 20 min at 4 °C. The labeling reaction was stopped with 100 mm glycine in PBS, pH 8.5, plus 5 mm EDTA for 5 min at 4 °C, and the cells were washed two times with RPMI 1640 and then incubated in RPMI 1640 with or without 10% FBS with 10 nm ligand or medium alone for 0-9 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer and boiled for 15 min. Approximately 100 μg of each lysate was diluted 1:10 with mild lysis buffer and incubated with 100 μl of a slurry of immobilized streptavidin-agarose resin for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins bound to the resin were washed three times with 10 ml of PBS containing 0.1% SDS and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed with anti-ERBB2 or anti-ERBB3 as a primary antibody and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP as the secondary antibody. ERBB3 Down-regulation Assay—MCF7 cells were prepared as described for the tyrosine phosphorylation assays and then stimulated with 10 nm NRG1176, Ig-NRG1, or Trx-NRG1 in RPMI 1640 or incubated with RPMI 1640 alone for 0-9 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed in PBS and lysed in SDS lysis buffer. Lysates were directly evaluated for ERBB3 levels by immunoblot analysis with anti-ERBB3 and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP. Prolonged Ligand Exposure—MCF7 cells were seeded as described for co-immunoprecipitations and then starved with RPMI 1640 with 2% FBS for 24 h. Following starvation, cells were incubated with either NRG1176, Ig-NRG1, or Trx-NRG1 at 10 nm or were left untreated in RPMI 1640 with 2% FBS for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer and boiled for 15 min, and total protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit. SDS-PAGE was carried out on 30 μg of each lysate. The lysates were then evaluated for tyrosine phosphorylation and ERBB3 levels by immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine-HRP or anti-ERBB3 followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, respectively. Each experiment was done in duplicate. Autoradiograms were quantified using densitometry analysis. Growth Stimulation Assay—MCF7 cells were serum-starved in RPMI 1640 for 24 h before the experiment. Following starvation, cells were seeded at 4000 cells/well in a 96-well plate in RPMI with 2% FBS alone or containing 10 nm NRG1176 or Ig-NRG1 and incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. After 3 days, cell proliferation was measured using an XTT (({2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide})) assay. In this assay, the cells were incubated with 0.3 mg/ml XTT and 5 μg/ml phenazine methosulfate in RPMI for 4 h at 37°C. The reaction was stopped using 3.3% SDS, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Cell growth was calculated using absorbance readings at 490 nm. Each experiment was done six times. ERBB3-ECD Oligomer Disruption Assay by Chemical Cross-linking—V5 and His6 epitope-tagged ERBB3-ECD was diluted with PBS or with PBS containing a 5-fold molar excess of Ig-NRG1, NRG1176, or bovine serum albumin control at a final ECD concentration of 100 nm. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, a 100-fold molar excess of bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate was added to each construct, and samples were incubated for an additional 2 h at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with Tris base (1 m) and spermidine (100 mm). Samples were run on 4-15% gradient gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with anti-V5-HRP or anti-His5-HRP antibodies. ERBB3-ECD Oligomer Disruption Assay by ERBB3-ECD Pull-down—ERBB3-H565F-ECDs carrying a C-terminal S-tag were preincubated in PBS for 15 min at room temperature at a final concentration of 0.50 μm. A total of 1.25 × 10-11 mol of ECD were subsequently immobilized on the S-protein-agarose resin that was blocked with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (equivalent of 50 μl of initial S-protein resin suspension) by incubation for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 1000 × g, and unbound S-tag ECDs were removed by two washes with S-tag wash buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5). After immobilization of the ECDs, free S-tag binding sites on the resin were saturated with excess S-tagged S-peptide, and the resin was washed twice with PBS to remove excess S-peptide and ECDs that were potentially displaced. Following washes, the immobilized ECDs were incubated for 15 min with PBS or the different indicated ligands at a final concentration of 1 μm. The eluted samples and resin after elution were probed with S-protein conjugated with HRP. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Binding experiments were performed on a BIAcore 3000 (BIAcore AB) at 25 °C as described previously (12Kani K. Warren C.M. Kaddis C.S. Loo J.A. Landgraf R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8238-8247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) but with immobilized receptor instead of ligand. This precludes the analysis of small ligands but facilitates the direct comparison of different ligands of sufficient size. To ensure that ERBB3-ECDs immobilized as spatially separated monomers and to protect the ligand binding site from damage by chemical modification (known to occur with amine-modifying reagents), ERBB3-ECD (36 nm) was immobilized in the presence of 75 nm Trx-NRG1. Coupling was carried out in HEPES (25 mm, pH 6.0) on a BIAcore CM5 chip functionalized with N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide N-hydroxy-succinimide (EDC/NHS) to introduce N-hydroxysuccinimide esters. The reference flow cell was coated with Trx-NRG1 only. Injections of ligands were carried out at multiple concentrations and flow rates to rule out mass transfer effects, and the presented KD values were obtained by direct fitting of dissociation on and off rates to individual surface plasmon resonance curves. Homology Model of ERBB3 Dimer—An approximate homology model of ligand-bound ERBB3 was generated using Swiss-Model (36Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar). This model is a composite based on the dimer of domains I-III of EGFR with bound ligand (37Garrett T.P.

McKern N.M. Lou M. Elleman T.C. Adams T.E. Lovrecz G.O. Kofler M. Jorissen R.N. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Ward C.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), since domain IV is absent in the ligand-bound EGFR crystal structure. The design of this EGFR/ERBB2 chimeric structure is aided by the high degree of structural homology for the individual domains of ERBB receptors. The sequence of ERBB3-ECD was aligned to the sequence of the EGFR/ERBB2 chimera and was generated using Swiss-Model. The EGF-like domain of neuregulin was aligned and modeled to transforming growth factor-α by the same method. In order to provide a graphic representation of the location and relative size of the Ig-like domain, the Ig-like domain with the predicted closest match to the Ig-like domain of NRG1 was identified using the UCLA/Department of Energy fold server (40Mallick P. Weiss R. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16041-16046Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 41Fischer D. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11929-11934Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The sequence with the highest score (Protein Data Bank code 1qp1) was used as a structural and sequence template for a model of the Ig-like domain. However, due to large variations in the length of loop regions between Ig-like domains, the generated “structure” can only serve as model for the relative size of the Ig-like domain and is unlikely to have much predictive value beyond this application.

https://openalex.org/W2013364570,"A major mechanism for human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) resistance to nucleoside analogs involves the phosphorolytical removal of the chain-terminating nucleotide from the 3′-end of the primer. In this work, we analyzed the effect of phosphonoformate (PFA) and other pyrophosphate (PPi) analogs on PPi- and ATP-dependent phosphorolysis catalyzed by HIV-1 RT. Our experimental data demonstrated that PFA did not behave as a linear inhibitor but as an alternative substrate, allowing RT to remove AZT from a terminated primer through a PFA-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, in non-terminated primers, PFA was not a substrate for this reaction and competitively inhibited PPi- and ATP-dependent phosphorolysis. In fact, binding of PFA to the RT·template/primer complex was hindered by the presence of a chain terminator at the 3′-end of the primer. Other pyrophosphate analogs, such as phosphonoacetate, were substrates for the excision reaction with both terminated and nonterminated primers, whereas pamidronate, a bisphosphonate that prevents bone resorption, was not a substrate for these reactions and competitively inhibited the phosphorolytic activity of RT. As expected from their mechanisms of action, pamidronate (but not PFA) synergistically inhibits HIV-1 RT in combination with AZT-triphosphate in the presence of PPi or ATP. These results provide new clues about the mechanism of action of PFA and demonstrate that only certain pyrophosphate analogs can enhance the effect of nucleosidic inhibitors by blocking the excision of chain-terminating nucleotides catalyzed by HIV-1 RT. The relevance of these findings in combined chemotherapy is discussed.

Most of the drugs currently used for the clinical treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 2The abbreviations and trivial names used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; AZT, 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine; AZTMP, AZT-5′-monophosphate; AZTTP, AZT-5′-triphosphate; RT, reverse transcriptase; RTAZT, AZT-resistant reverse transcriptase; 4-arylmethylpyridinone, 3-dimethylamino-4-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)-5-ethyl-6-methylpyridin-2(1H)-one; NNRTI, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; PPi, inorganic pyrophosphate; PFA, phosphonoformate; pamidronate, 3-amino-1-hydroxy-1-phosphonopropyl phosphonic acid; ddC, dideoxycytidine; ddT, dideoxythymidine.2The abbreviations and trivial names used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; AZT, 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine; AZTMP, AZT-5′-monophosphate; AZTTP, AZT-5′-triphosphate; RT, reverse transcriptase; RTAZT, AZT-resistant reverse transcriptase; 4-arylmethylpyridinone, 3-dimethylamino-4-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)-5-ethyl-6-methylpyridin-2(1H)-one; NNRTI, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; PPi, inorganic pyrophosphate; PFA, phosphonoformate; pamidronate, 3-amino-1-hydroxy-1-phosphonopropyl phosphonic acid; ddC, dideoxycytidine; ddT, dideoxythymidine. are targeted against the viral reverse transcriptase (RT). Two major classes of RT inhibitors have been identified, nucleoside analogs and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (1Gotte M. Expert Rev. Anti. Infect. Ther. 2004; 2: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 2Vivet-Boudou V. Didierjean J. Isel C. Marquet R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 163-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Nucleoside analogs, such as ddC or 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT), are phosphorylated within the cell and compete with natural deoxynucleotides for their incorporation into the growing DNA chain. NNRTIs, such as nevirapine or efavirenz, are a diverse set of compounds that bind to a hydrophobic pocket in close proximity to the active site, inhibiting DNA polymerization. Although there is no cure available at present, the successful management of patients with AIDS requires the combination of three or more drugs to abrogate viral replication. Most combination therapies for HIV include AZT. Long term therapy with AZT leads to the emergence of resistant viral strains harboring RT with classical zidovudine-associated amino acid substitutions (generally referred to as thymidine analog mutations or TAMs). Mutant reverse transcriptase (RTAZT) is able to remove the incorporated AZT in the presence of ATP (3Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. So A.G. Scott W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13471-13476Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 4Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4832-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Moreover, ATP-dependent phosphorolysis (and probably PPi-dependent phosphorolysis) is also the most frequent mechanism of resistance to other nucleoside analogs such as d4T (5Ray A.S. Murakami E. Basavapathruni A. Vaccaro J.A. Ulrich D. Chu C.K. Schinazi R.F. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8831-8841Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 6Goldschmidt V. Marquet R. Int. J. Biochem.

Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In fact, using combinations of various mutations, it is likely that some mutants of RT will be able to excise most nucleoside analogs with varying efficiencies (8Sarafianos S.G. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1706-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For this reason, there is an urgent need for new drugs that can inhibit the excision reaction. Previously, we and others have described that NNRTIs inhibit the excision of the chain-terminating AZTMP catalyzed by HIV-1 RT, resensitizing the AZT-resistant enzyme to this compound (9Borkow G. Arion D. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 259-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Odriozola L. Cruchaga C. Andreola M. Dolle V. Nguyen C.H. Tarrago-Litvak L. Perez-Mediavilla A. Martinez-Irujo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42710-42716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thereafter, it was shown that NNRTIs inhibit the excision of other nucleoside analogs (11Basavapathruni A. Bailey C.M. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6221-6224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and that this inhibition is responsible for the synergy found in antiviral combinations between AZT and NNRTIs (12Cruchaga C. Odriozola L. Andreola M. Tarrago-Litvak L. Martinez-Irujo J.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3535-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although the clinical relevance of these findings needs to be established, the inhibition of RT-catalyzed nucleotide excision from a terminated primer seems to be related to the superior long term efficacy of combinations containing a NNRTI over combinations containing only nucleoside analogs. As an example, a phase III trial (13Gulick R.M. Ribaudo H.J. Shikuma C.M. Lustgarten S. Squires K.E. Meyer III, W.A. Acosta E.P. Schackman B.R. Pilcher C.D. Murphy R.L. Maher W.E.

Med. 2004; 350: 1850-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) has shown that a combination of three nucleoside analogs is clearly inferior to other efavirenz-containing treatment regimens. There are other possible strategies to inhibit the excision reaction. It has been proposed that compounds that interfere with the binding of ATP, or analogs of the dinucleoside tetraphosphate product of the reaction, might be suitable for this purpose (8Sarafianos S.G. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1706-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Other straightforward candidates are pyrophosphate analogs (1Gotte M. Expert Rev. Anti. Infect. Ther. 2004; 2: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Cruchaga C. Odriozola L. Andreola M. Tarrago-Litvak L. Martinez-Irujo J.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3535-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Phosphonoformate (foscarnet or PFA) is a classic PPi analog that has been shown to inhibit a broad spectrum of DNA polymerases, including herpes viruses and HIV-1 RT (14Oberg B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 40: 213-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Despite its activity toward HIV-1, PFA is used exclusively to treat opportunistic viral infections such as human cytomegalovirus, acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex, and varicella-zoster virus infections in patients with immunodeficiency. Based on its putative mechanism of action, it was expected that foscarnet would block phosphorolysis and therefore would enhance the effect of AZT. Moreover, it has been reported that zidovudine resistance is suppressed by mutations conferring resistance to foscarnet (15Tachedjian G. Mellors J. Bazmi H. Birch C. Mills J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7171-7181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Arion D. Sluis Cremer N. Parniak M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9251-9255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), making this an attractive combination for chemotherapy. The combination of AZT with foscarnet in antiviral assays, however, shows low synergy or is merely additive (17Kong X.B. Zhu Q.Y. Ruprecht R.M. Watanabe K.A. Zeidler J.M. Gold J.W. Polsky B.

Dehlinger M. Hafner R. Mills J. J. Infect. Dis. 1991; 163: 1219-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to analyze whether PFA and some other pyrophosphate derivatives were able to inhibit the RT-catalyzed excision of chain-terminated primers. Our study shows for the first time that PFA is a substrate for phosphorolysis and that this compound, unlike other natural or artificial substrates described to date, is not a suitable substrate for the RT-catalyzed nucleotide excision from non-terminated primers. These results not only provide new clues about the mechanism of action of PFA but also support the notion that the inhibition of RT-catalyzed nucleotide excision from terminated primers is a relevant parameter for the interaction between pyrophosphate analogs and chain-terminating nucleotides.

Pyrophosphate Analogs—Phosphonoacetic acid and potassium pyrosulfate were purchased from Aldrich. Sodium disulfite was purchased from Merck. Methylenediphosphonic acid, dichloromethlylenediphosphonic acid (disodium salt), sodium phosphonoformate, sodium orthovanadate, and sodium pamidronate (3-amino-1-hydroxy-1-phosphonopropyl phosphonic acid, trisodium salt) were purchased from Sigma. Phosphorolysis Assays—To analyze the kinetics of nucleotide removal using PFA or phosphonoacetate as a substrate, d21-AZTMP, d21-ddTMP, d21-ddCMP, and d21 were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled primer was annealed to a 3-fold excess of RNA template (r39 or r39G). The annealed template/primer (1 nm) was incubated with 25 nm RT in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1.25 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mm MgCl2 at pH 8) containing 20 mm NaCl in the presence of the indicated amounts of PFA or phosphonoacetate. Reactions were stopped at different times by adding the same volume of loading buffer (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol), and samples were analyzed by denaturing PAGE as described previously (10Odriozola L. Cruchaga C. Andreola M. Dolle V. Nguyen C.H. Tarrago-Litvak L. Perez-Mediavilla A. Martinez-Irujo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42710-42716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To measure the inhibition of RT-catalyzed phosphorolysis by NNRTIs or pyrophosphate analogs, the annealed template/primer (1 nm) was incubated in a final volume of 50 μl with 25 nm RT in Buffer A containing the indicated amounts of NaCl, inhibitor, and PPi or ATP. Reactions were stopped by the addition of the same volume of loading buffer, and samples were analyzed by denaturing PAGE (12Cruchaga C. Odriozola L. Andreola M. Tarrago-Litvak L. Martinez-Irujo J.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3535-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Detection of RT·Template/Primer Complexes with Foscarnet by Mobility Shift Assays—The ability of HIV-1 RT to form a stable complex with the template/primer was assessed as described previously (22Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Zonarich D. Chopra R.R. Pendarvis E. Bazmi H.Z. Mellors J.W. Scott W.A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6127-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For this purpose, the 5′-32P-labeled d21-AZTMP or d21 primer was annealed to d39 template. The annealed template/primer (4 nm) was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with PFA in Buffer A containing 20 mm NaCl. The reaction mixture was placed on ice for 5 min, and the putative ternary complexes formed were challenged by the addition of 1.5 μm poly(rA)-(dT)20. After 5 min of incubation, 5 μl of loading buffer (30% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue) were added, and the ternary complexes resistant to this trap were resolved in a non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel. Inhibition by PFA of DNA Polymerase Activity—RT was incubated in Buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl with the 5-32P-labeled d21 primer at a concentration of 1 nm annealed to the template (r39 or r36) and 10 μm dNTPs in a final volume of 50 μl. Reactions were quenched at the indicated times by the addition of an equal volume of loading buffer (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol). The samples were analyzed by denaturing PAGE using 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. Synergy Analysis—To measure the combined effect of two inhibitors on RT activity, 10 nm RT was added to a mixture prepared in Buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl, 3 nm poly(rA)-(dT)20, 20 μm [α-33P]dTTP and the indicated amounts of the inhibitors with or without 250 μm PPi. After 20 min of incubation at 30 °C, they were quenched by adding 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Aliquots of 15 μl were spotted onto a DE81 paper (Whatman), washed three times with 0.5 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and then dried and counted. Synergy analysis was done by two approaches, as previously explained (12Cruchaga C. Odriozola L. Andreola M. Tarrago-Litvak L. Martinez-Irujo J.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3535-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, in a series of experiments, inhibitors were mixed in a constant proportion and interaction indexes calculated for each inhibition level. In the second approach, inhibitor concentrations were mixed in a checkerboard design and data plotted in a Yonetani-Theorell graph (12Cruchaga C. Odriozola L. Andreola M. Tarrago-Litvak L. Martinez-Irujo J.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3535-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this plot, synergy is detected by lines converging at the left of the y-axis, whereas parallel lines indicate zero interaction (mutually exclusive effects). Diverging lines, i.e. lines converging at the right of the y-axis, indicate antagonism. The abscissa value of the intercept point in this plot depends both on the potency of the inhibitor and on the magnitude of the interaction; therefore, the extent of the interaction can be quantified by calculating the –intercept:IC50 ratio (12Cruchaga C. Odriozola L. Andreola M. Tarrago-Litvak L. Martinez-Irujo J.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3535-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23Martinez-Irujo J.J. Villahermosa M.L. Mercapide J.

For synergistic combinations, this parameter takes positive values that decrease as synergy increases. Kinetics of PFA-dependent Phosphorolysis—First, we tested the ability of PFA to inhibit the ATP- and PPi-dependent removal of AZTMP from a terminated primer catalyzed by HIV-1 RT. The results obtained led us to the conclusion that PFA did not behave as a linear inhibitor but as an alternative substrate (see below). For this reason, we measured the kinetics of nucleotide excision using PFA as a substrate. Two template/primers were used for this purpose, an AZTMP-terminated template/primer (r39/d21-AZTMP) and a non-terminated template/primer (r39/d21) (Fig. 1). Excision of AZTMP followed apparent first order kinetics with a maximum rate of PFA-lysis (krem) of 0.0084 ± 0.0004 min–1 and an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 750 ± 90 μm. It is important to note that, with PFA as a substrate, RT selectively catalyzed the removal of AZTMP but did not proceed further (Fig. 1A). Consequently, RT was unable to remove the last nucleotide from d21, even when incubated for 8 h with 2.5 mm PFA (Fig. 1B). The same result was obtained with r39/d22T and with a similar template/primer having dCMP at its 3′-end (r39G/d22C) (data not shown). To determine whether the lack of phosphorolysis with the non-terminated template/primer was because of a reduced affinity of RT for PFA, we used a gel binding assay. In these experiments, the amount of template/primer detected in complex in the mobility shift assay was measured as a function of the concentration of PFA. As shown in Fig. 2, PFA binds far better to the RT·d39/d21 complex (Kd = 49 ± 5 μm) than to the RT·d39/d21-AZTMP complex (Kd = 730 ± 80 μm). These results indicated that the inability of RT to excise AZTMP using PFA as a substrate was not a result of PFA binding poorly to RT but to the fact that PFA binds in a different manner to RT, depending on the nature of the 3′-end of the primer. Inhibition by PFA of RT-catalyzed Phosphorolysis—PFA is a well known inhibitor of cellular and viral DNA polymerases. However, its effect on ATP- or PPi-dependent phosphorolysis catalyzed by HIV-1 RT has not yet been studied. In the absence of dNTPs, RT catalyzed the successive excision of nucleotide residues from the 3′-end of blocked and unblocked primers using PPi as a substrate (Fig. 3). PFA inhibited the PPi-dependent nucleotide excision by HIV-1 RT from r39/d21 (Fig. 3A) or r39G/d22C in the micromolar range. However, this compound does not completely block the PPi-dependent AZTMP (Fig. 3B), ddTMP (Fig. 3C), or ddCMP excision from terminated primers, even in the millimolar range. The apparent inhibition constants (Kic) determined from Dixon plots with r39/d21-AZTMP, r39/d21-ddTMP, or r39G/d21-ddCMP were >20 mm (Fig. 4), whereas the apparent Kic values obtained with d21 or d22C primers were 170 ± 10 and 110 ± 29 μm, respectively. Moreover, Dixon plots obtained when the template/primer was blocked with AZTMP or ddTMP showed obvious deviations from linearity, particularly at low PPi concentrations. Non-linearity arose because PFA was a substrate for the phosphorolysis reaction. In fact, the pattern of inhibition found in Fig. 4 corresponds to the expected plot obtained with two alternative substrates when varying the poorer substrate (PFA) at the constancy of the better one (PPi) (24Bisswanger H. Enzyme Kinetics, Principles and Methods. 1st. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2002: 106-108Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Inhibition of PPi-dependent phosphorolysis by PFA. A, Dixon plots obtained for the inhibition of the PPi-mediated excision of the first (left) and second (right) nucleotides from the 3′-end of d21-AZTMP primer by PFA. Apparent Kic values estimated by these graphs were >20 mm and 86 μm ± 15, respectively. Concentrations of PPi were 75 (○), 150 (•), 600 (□), 1200 (▪), and 4800 μm (▵). B, Dixon plots obtained for the inhibition by PFA of the PPi-mediated excision of the first (left) and second (right) nucleotides from the 3′-end of d21-ddTMP primer. Apparent Kic values estimated from these graphs were >20 mm and 79 ± 5 μm, respectively. C, scheme showing the mechanism of inhibition of phosphorolysis by PFA. With AZTMP- or ddTMP-terminated primers, PFA did not act as a linear inhibitor but as an alternative (poorer) substrate for HIV-1 RT. With non-terminated or unblocked primers, PFA was not a substrate for phosphorolysis but a competitive inhibitor of this reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although PFA was unable to completely block the excision of AZTMP, ddTMP, or ddCMP from a terminated primer, the inhibition of the PPi-mediated excision of the second and following nucleotides of the primer is quite efficient. Fig. 4 also shows the inhibition patterns obtained with PFA when the removal of the second nucleotide from AZTMP- or ddTMP-terminated primers was measured. Dixon plots gave inhibition constants of 86 ± 15 and 79 ± 5 μm, respectively. These values are consistent with the Kd obtained for the binding of PFA to the RT·d39/d21 complex (49 ± 5 μm) (Fig. 2) and confirm that both the affinity and the mode of binding of PFA to RT depend on the nature of the last nucleotide of the primer. It has been described that resistance to AZT displayed by mutant RT (RTAZT) is due to the increased ability of this enzyme to unblock the AZTMP-terminated primer in the presence of ATP (3Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. So A.G. Scott W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13471-13476Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 4Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4832-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For this reason, we also analyzed the effect of PFA on ATP-dependent phosphorolysis catalyzed by RTAZT. PFA inhibited the ATP-dependent removal of the 3′-terminal nucleotide from d21 primer with an estimated Kic of 37 ± 9 μm (Fig. 5C). Under the same conditions, PFA was unable to completely block the rescue of AZTMP catalyzed by RTAZT with ATP as substrate (Fig. 5B). Even more, at 0.5 mm ATP, the amount of d21-AZTMP substrate decreased rather than increased as the concentration of PFA was raised because of the PFA-dependent excision activity of HIV-1 RT. As a consequence, Dixon plots clearly deviate from linearity, particularly at low ATP concentrations (Fig. 5D); therefore, PFA shows a dual effect. At low concentrations, it inhibits the ATP- or PPi-meditated removal of a terminated primer, because PFA is a poorer substrate for RT than PPi or ATP. However, at high concentrations, this compound enhances the rescue of the terminated primer because of the PFA-dependent phosphorolysis. Inhibition of HIV-1 RT-dependent DNA Polymerization by PFA—To go more deeply into the mechanism of action of PFA, we analyzed the inhibition of HIV-1 RT-dependent DNA polymerization by this compound (Fig. 6). In these experiments, a heteropolymeric template was used to restrict the number of nucleotides sequentially incorporated by the enzyme. In the presence of only dTTP, RT incorporated a single nucleotide into the primer. Interestingly, the incorporation of dTMP was not inhibited by millimolar concentrations of PFA (Fig. 6A). In the presence of both dTTP and dCTP, up to 4 nucleotides were incorporated, and the amount of PFA needed to inhibit 50% of the production of full-length DNA decreased to 0.1 mm. If three rather than two deoxynucleotides were present, the enzyme incorporated up to 9 residues, and the IC50 value decreased to 0.01 mm. In fact, as the number of nucleotides sequentially incorporated increased, the IC50 value of PFA decreased to the low micromolar range. The calculated IC50 value changed from ∼10 mm to 1 μm when the number of incorporated nucleotides increased from 1 to 15. In addition, polymerized DNA chains shortened as PFA concentrations increased, as happens with chain-terminating nucleotides. As a control, we also included a NNRTI (4-arylmethylpyridinone) that inhibited both DNA polymerase and phosphorolysis reactions by binding to a site on the RT adjacent to, but distinct from, the catalytic site. This inhibitor clearly showed a different inhibition pattern. Fig. 6B shows that the total amount of polymerized chains (but not their size) was reduced upon the addition of the NNRTI. Moreover, the IC50 value for 4-arylmethylpyridinone was the same irrespective of the number of nucleotides incorporated by the enzyme (Fig. 6C). Inhibition of RT-catalyzed Phosphorolysis by Other PPi Analogs—To find a more effective inhibitor of the RT-catalyzed phosphorolysis, we selected a variety of structural PPi analogs. Compounds analyzed included phosphonoacetate, orthovanadate, disulfite, pyrosulfate, methylenediphosphonate, dichloromethylene diphosphonate, and pamidronate. From these, only pamidronate and orthovanadate inhibited RT-catalyzed phosphorolysis (Fig. 7A). On the other hand, high concentrations of phosphonoacetate enhanced rather than inhibited phosphorolysis, suggesting that phosphonoacetate was a substrate for this reaction. As shown in Fig. 7B, phosphonoacetate, unlike PFA, is a suitable substrate for RT-catalyzed nucleotide excision from both terminated and non-terminated primers. In fact, the rate of excision (kobs) for RT in the presence of 2.5 mm phosphonoacetate was about three times greater with a non-terminated template/primer than with a template/primer terminated with AZTMP. Fig. 7C shows the inhibition of PPi-dependent phosphorolysis by pamidronate. At low (<150 μm) PPi concentrations, pamidronate effectively inhibited this reaction at submillimolar concentrations. As PPi concentration was raised, inhibition by pamidronate decreased, as expected for a competitive inhibitor (Kic = 400 ± 47 μm). On the other hand, pamidronate was not a suitable substrate for this reaction, even at the higher concentration tested (5 mm). Effect of the Combination of AZTTP with PPi Analogs on RT Activity—Removal of AZTMP from the terminated primer mediated by the human HIV-1 reverse transcriptase has been found to be a relevant mechanism for the resistance of HIV to AZT. For this reason, we analyzed the effect of the combination of PFA and pamidronate with AZTTP on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase under conditions in which phosphorolysis takes place. As a control, we included two NNRTIs, efavirenz, and 4-arylmethylpyridinone, which exhibit a strong synergy when combined with AZTTP due to the inhibition of the RT-catalyzed phosphorolysis by the NNRTI (10Odriozola L.

https://openalex.org/W2080352377,"Transport of tRNAs across the inner mitochondrial membrane of the kinetoplastid protozoon Leishmania requires interactions with specific binding proteins (receptors) in a multi-subunit complex. The allosteric model of import regulation proposes cooperative and antagonistic interactions between two or more receptors with binding specificities for distinct tRNA families (types I and II, respectively). To identify the type II receptor, the gene encoding RIC8A, a subunit of the complex, was cloned. The C-terminal region of RIC8A is homologous to subunit 6b of ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase (respiratory complex III), while the N-terminal region has intrinsic affinity for type II, but not for type I, tRNAs. RIC8A is shared by the import complex and complex III, indicating its bi-functionality, but is assembled differently in the two complexes. Knockdown of RIC8A in Leishmania lowered the mitochondrial content of type II tRNAs but raised that of type I tRNAs, with downstream effects on mitochondrial translation and respiration, and cell death. In RIC8A knockdown cells, a subcomplex was formed that interacted with type I tRNA, but the negative regulation by type II tRNA was lost. Mitochondrial extracts from these cells were defective for type II, but not type I, import; import and regulation were restored by purified RIC8A. These results provide evidence for the relevance of allosteric regulation in vivo and indicate that acquisition of new tRNA-binding domains by ancient respiratory components have played a key role in the evolution of mitochondrial tRNA import.

Mitochondria from a large number of species, including protists, higher plants, some invertebrates, and eutherian mammals do not contain sufficient numbers of functional tRNA genes and therefore import cytoplasmic tRNAs to support the translation of organellar mRNAs (reviewed in Refs. 1Bhattacharyya S.N.

Mitochondrial tRNA import is especially important in kinetoplastid protozoa such as Leishmania and Trypanosoma that lack all mitochondrial tRNA genes (3Simpson A.M. Suyama Y. Dewes H. Campbell D.

The precise manner in which polyanionic tRNA molecules cross the double mitochondrial membrane, is largely unresolved. In yeast, the mitochondrial protein import pore, as well as cytosolic carrier proteins, appears to be involved (5Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. J. Mol.

On the other hand, biochemical studies in kinetoplastid protozoa have revealed that these organisms have specialized mechanisms for import of tRNA that are distinct from those for protein import (7Nabholz C.E.

Leishmania and Trypanosoma mitochondria recognize sequence/structure motifs (import signals) in distinct domains of individual tRNAs (9Bhattacharyya S.N. Mukherjee S. Adhya S. Mol. Cell.

However, there are differences in the intrinsic efficiencies of transfer of individual RNAs through the inner, as opposed to the outer membrane, in vitro; some, designated as type I RNAs, are imported efficiently into the matrix, whereas others (type II) are not. The potential problem of an imbalanced matrix tRNA pool is solved by the unique phenomenon of allosteric regulation; type I RNAs stimulate the inner membrane transfer of type II RNAs, whereas type II RNAs inhibit transfer of type I (11Bhattacharyya S.N.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5552-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). On the basis of these interactions, tRNATyr, tRNAArg, and tRNATrp have been identified as type I, and tRNAIle, tRNAVal, and tRNAMet-e have been identified as type II, respectively (11Bhattacharyya S.N.

The Coomassie Blue-stained 21-kDa band of RIC8 was trypsinized, and the peptides were subjected to liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry analysis at the W. M. Keck Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Laboratory (University of Virginia). Sequenced peptides were matched against the NCBI and Leishmania major data bases (www.genedb.org/genedb/leish/index.jsp) to identify the corresponding genes using the BLAST or Sequest program. Selected sequences were aligned using ClustalW (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/index.html). Secondary structure predictions were made by the PredictProtein server (www.cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/). Automated homology modeling of the Leishmania protein was performed by the SWISS-MODEL server (www.expasy.ch/swissmod/SWISS-MODEL.html), using the crystallographic structure of subunit 6 (Protein Data Bank code 1ntm) of bovine ubiquinol cytochrome c oxidase (Complex III) as template. The results were viewed in the Deep View/Swiss Pdb Viewer v. 3.7, and ray-traced images were generated using the POV-Ray 3.6 package. Cloning of RIC8A Gene—Sense and antisense primers (supplemental Table S1) corresponding to the open reading frame of RIC8A were used to amplify the intact or truncated gene from L. tropica strain UR6 genomic DNA. The sense primer was designed to have a BamHI restriction site at the 5′ end in frame with the coding sequence of the insert; the antisense primer had an inframe stop codon followed by a SalI site. The amplified fragment was cloned into TA vector pTZ57R (MBI Fermentas). Other genes were cloned and expressed similarly (13Goswami S. Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S.

Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To refold the protein, the soluble SDS extract was diluted 5-fold into TETN250 buffer (14Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 2 h at 4°C before assay. Electrophoretically pure recombinant protein was used to raise polyclonal antibody in BALB/c mice. Blue Native (BN) PAGE—Inner membrane mitochondrial complexes of L. tropica or the human HepG2 cell line were resolved as previously described (13Goswami S. Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria were extracted with BAM buffer (50 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.75 m ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 2% dodecyl maltoside) for 45 min at 4 °C, and the extract was concentrated to ∼10 μl/200 μgof mitochondria by centrifugal ultrafiltration in a Microcon 30 unit (Amicon). Coomassie Blue G-250 (0.5%) was added to the extract before electrophoresis on 6% Blue Native gels (21Schagger H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 555-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For two-dimensional analysis, protein bands of the first dimension were denatured with 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol for 40 min at 37 °C and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Preparation of Radiolabeled tRNA—32P-Labeled tRNAs of high and low specific activity were prepared by T7 polymerase-mediated run-off transcription as described (11Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Adhya S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Goswami S. Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Import Assays—Purified RIC (100 ng) was incorporated into phosphatidylcholine vesicles (50 μg lipid) and incubated with 32P-labeled tRNA (5 nm) and 4 mm ATP, and uptake was analyzed by RNase protection, as previously described (14Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For immuno-inhibition experiments, proteoliposomes were preincubated with antiserum (1:50) for 30 min on ice. Where indicated, low specific activity effector tRNAs were present at one-tenth the concentration of the high specific activity substrate tRNA. Western and Northwestern Blots—Native complexes resolved by BN PAGE were denatured in situ before blot transfer, as described (13Goswami S. Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The blots were probed with 1:100 dilution of antiserum and developed by the alkaline phosphatase colorimetric method. For Northwestern blots, the membrane was probed with 32P-labeled tRNA (17Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Binding Assays—Indicated amounts of purified, recombinant refolded RIC8A were incubated with 32P-labeled tRNAIle (10–100 fmol) in 10-μl reactions containing binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m KCl) for 30 min on ice and then electrophoresed on native gradient polyacrylamide gels (14Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to resolve the ribonucleoprotein from free tRNA. Dried gel bands were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Liposome binding assays were carried out under similar conditions with 250 ng of purified RIC incorporated into 80 μg of lipid and 1–250 fmol of tRNAIle, the vesicles were washed, and bound RNA was recovered for electrophoresis. Scatchard analysis was carried out by titrating a fixed amount of RIC8A (50 fmol) or liposome-bound RIC with tRNAIle. The plot of bound/free tRNA against the bound tRNA concentration yields a best fit curve with a slope of –1/Kd, where Kd is the dissociation constant for the complex. The total receptor concentration, [R]0, is the intercept on the x axis. Photochemical Cross-linking—T7 RNA polymerase transcripts were doubly labeled with [α-32P]UTP and 5-bromo-UTP and cross-linked to protein as previously described (14Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNA was incubated with affinity-purified RIC or mitochondrial complexes and then UV-irradiated. Cross-linked RNA·protein complexes were immunoprecipitated after dissociation of the subunits with SDS and resolved by urea-PAGE (14Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Northern Blotting—Total promastigote RNA was electrophoresed on a 5% acrylamide, 8 m urea gel, electroblotted on to a Hybond N+ membrane, and probed with radiolabeled RIC8A coding region. Conditional Knockdown—Details of the construction of L. tropica 13–90, a host containing constitutively expressed T7 RNA polymerase and Tet repressor genes, and of the targeting vector pGET, have been described (13Goswami S. Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Knockdown vector pGET(AS)RIC8A was constructed by inserting the RIC8A gene between the HindIII and BamHI sites of pGET (i.e. in the reverse orientation with respect to the inducible T7 promoter). L. tropica 13–90 was transfected with pGET(AS)RIC8A and transformants selected on semi-solid agar containing G418, hygromycin, and 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin. The clones were grown in medium 199 containing the same antibiotics. The cultures were induced with 1 μg/ml tetracycline, and cell growth was monitored. Intracellular parameters were measured at 48 h, the time point at which cessation of growth was first observed. RT-PCR—Uninduced or induced cells were harvested, lysed, and separated into soluble (cytosolic) and particulate (mitochondrial) fractions (9Bhattacharyya S.N. Mukherjee S. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7410-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The crude mitochondria were treated with DNase and RNase before RNA isolation. RNA from 102–105 cells was denatured at 95 °C and reverse transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen) and the appropriate primer, as follows: (1Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. RNA Biol. 2004; 1: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) for antisense RNA, the sense primer from the 5′ end of the coding region of RIC8A; (2Schneider A. Marechal-Drouard L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 509-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) for mRNA or tRNA, the antisense primer complementary to the 3′ end of the gene (supplemental Table S1). The second primer was then added, and the cDNA was amplified with Taq DNA polymerase. To obtain proportional PCR signals, RT-PCR was performed with different amounts of input RNA. Import Reconstitution—Liposomes were reconstituted with mitochondrial extracts from knockdown cells and recombinant import factor as described (13Goswami S. Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, refolded RIC8A (8 ng in 2 μl) and concentrated mitochondrial extract (5 × 106 cell equivalent in 8 μl) were incubated with liposomes (50 μg of lipid in 10 μl) for 1 h at 4°C and then assayed for import as above. RNA End Labeling—Total mitochondrial tRNA was dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase, ethanol-precipitated, and 5′-labeled with [γ-32P] ATP in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase. Mitochondrial Assays—Mitochondrial translation assays by [35S]methionine labeling of promastogotes in presence of cycloheximide, oxygen uptake measurements, and cytochrome oxidase cytochemical assays were performed as described (13Goswami S. Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Homology of an RIC Subunit with a Complex III Component—On resolution of RIC by SDS-PAGE, a protein of 21 kDa (previously designated as RIC21p; now renamed RIC8) was observed that was present in the stoichiometry of 2–3/complex (Ref. 14Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar; see Fig. 3B). This protein was subjected to mass spectrometric sequencing, and the tryptic peptides were searched for in the L. major data base (18Ivens A.C. Peacock C.S. Worthey E.A. Murphy L. Aggarwal G. Berriman M. Sisk E. Rajandream M.-A. Adlem E. Aert R. Anupama A. Apostolou Z. Attipoe P. Bason N. Bauser C. Beck A. Beverley S.M. Bianchettin G. Borzym K. Bothe G. Bruschi C.V. Collins M. Cadag E.

Zimmermann W. Smith D.F. Blackwell J.M. Stuart K.D. Barrell B. Myler P.J. Science. 2005; 309: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar) to retrieve complete open reading frames (ORFs). This resulted in the recovery of 10 ORFs, of which six were discarded as possible contaminants because of low protein coverage (less than 10%) or abnormally small size (less than 10 kDa). Of the remaining four (ORF-A, ORF-B, ORF-C, and ORF-D), ORF-C has sequence similarity with the iron-sulfur protein of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II), ORF-B is a mitochondrial protein associated with a ribonucleoprotein (19Bringaud F. Peris M. Zen K.H. Simpson L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and ORF-D does not have sequence similarity with any known protein. 3S. Chatterjee and S. Adhya, unpublished data. These four ORFs were expressed separately in E. coli, and antibody was raised against each recombinant protein. Of these four antibodies, only anti-RIC8A (ORF-A) inhibited import in vitro. 3S. Chatterjee and S. Adhya, unpublished data. We therefore focused on the role of RIC8A, one of the major constituents of the 21-kDa band. BLAST analysis of RIC8A (systematic gene name LmjF35.0100 in the L. major data base) shows sequence similarities (28–30% identity) to the subunit 6b (or in the case of yeast, subunit 7) of respiratory Complex III (ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase or UCR) from a wide variety of species (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). The L. tropica coding region is identical to that from L. major. 3S. Chatterjee and S. Adhya, unpublished data. In Leishmania and the related kinetoplastid protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei, the corresponding predicted proteins are nearly identical in length (201–202 amino acid residues) and sequence (89 and 84% identity between Leishmania and the other two species). In other species such as man, UCR6b is smaller (14 kDa; see Fig. 1D). The sequence similarity between RIC8A and UCR6b is confined to the C-terminal 100 or so residues of the former. This similarity was confirmed by homology modeling of the secondary structure (Fig. 1B), which shows a four-helical bundle in the C-terminal region of RIC8A that is superimposable on the crystallographic structure of UCR6 (20Gao X. Wen X. Esser L. Quinn B. Yu L. Yu C.A. Xia D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9067-9080Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The N-terminal extension does not show significant similarity to any known protein but is predicted to contain 1) several α-helices, one of which includes a periodic repeat of basic amino acids (between residues 42 and 61); and 2) a short cleaved mitochondrial targeting sequence, with the mature N terminus at Met-10 (as indicated by peptide sequencing). In Leishmania, there is a single gene for this protein (LmjF35.0100; henceforth designated as RIC8A/UCR6b) on chromosome 35 (17Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A single 0.77-kb mRNA is expressed in promastigotes (Fig. 1C), Moreover, a single 21-kDa protein is present predominantly in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 1D). Type II tRNA Binding by RIC8A/UCR6b—To assess the tRNA binding activity of RIC8A, Western blots of bacterially expressed, gel-purified RIC8A, after suitable renaturation treatments in situ, were probed with radiolabeled tRNAs. Under these conditions, RIC8A interacted with tRNAIle, tRNAVal, and tRNAMet-e (all type II tRNAs), but with none of the type I tRNAs (Fig. 2A). The tRNA·protein complex was detected by gel shift assays using purified RIC8A, which confirmed the specificity for type II tRNA (Fig. 2B). Scatchard analysis (Fig. 2C) yielded a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.42 nm at 4 °C for the tRNAIle·RIC8A complex (Table 1). Thus, RIC8A has an intrinsic affinity for type II tRNAs.TABLE 1Affinity of RIC8A for tRNAIleProteintRNATyr effectorKd[R]0nmnmFree RIC8A-0.422.28Complex-bound RIC8A-26.240.16Complex-bound RIC8A+5.291.75 Open table in a new tab To determine the location of the tRNA-binding site, the N- and C-terminal domains (residues 1–82 and 83–202, respectively) were separately expressed in E. coli, and the purified proteins were analyzed by Northwestern blotting using tRNAIle as probe. This experiment showed that only the N-terminal domain contains tRNA binding activity (Fig. 2D). Presence of RIC8A/UCR6b in Two Mitochondrial Complexes—In view of the facts that RIC8A/UCR6b is the product of a single gene, has structural similarity with UCR6b, binds tRNA, and is associated with the import complex, it is possible that RIC8A/UCR6b is a bi-functional protein with roles in both tRNA import and electron transport. To address this question, we resolved the mitochondrial inner membrane respiratory complexes of Leishmania by Blue Native gel electrophoresis (21Schagger H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 555-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A, left panel). As observed by us and others in the kinetoplastid protozoa Leishmania, Crithidia, and Phytomonas, (13Goswami S. Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Parasitol. 1999; 99: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), four complexes were discernible, corresponding to Complexes III, IV, and V and the largest complex, specific to kinetoplastid protozoa, that has been identified as the import complex (13Goswami S.

Immunoblotting of the resolved complexes revealed the presence of RIC8A/UCR6b in RIC and Complex III (Fig. 3A, right panel). The subunits of complex III and RIC were separated by denaturing electrophoresis in the second dimension. Most of the subunits in the two complexes are distinct, but Western blot analysis showed that the same 21-kDa RIC8A/UCR6b is shared by both (Fig. 3B), as expected of a bi-functional protein. Because RIC8A/UCR6b is shared by RIC and Complex III, we inquired whether both complexes can bind tRNA. When the mixture of native respiratory complexes obtained by detergent extraction of mitochondria was exposed to tRNAIle (type II) doubly labeled with 32P and 5-bromouridine (BU), a photoactivable nucleoside analogue, and then UV-irradiated, only RIC among the mitochondrial complexes was tagged; cross-linking required the presence of type I tRNA (Fig. 3C). In contrast, none of the human respiratory complexes interacted with tRNA under any condition (Fig. 3C). After dissociation of t"

https://openalex.org/W1967228498,"Smad proteins regulate transcription in response to transforming growth factor-β signaling pathways by binding to two distinct types of DNA sites. The sequence GTCT is recognized by all receptor-activated Smads and by Smad4. The subset of Smads that responds to bone morphogenetic protein signaling recognizes a distinct class of GC-rich sites in addition to GTCT. Recent work has shown that Drosophila Mad protein, the homologue of bone morphogenetic protein rSmads, binds to GRCGNC sites through the same MH1 domain β-hairpin interface used to contact GTCT sites. However, binding to GRCGNC requires base-specific contact by two Mad proteins, and here we provide evidence that this is achieved by contact of the two Mad subunits that overlap across the two central base pairs of the site. This topology is supported by results indicating that His-93, which is located at the tip of the Mad β-hairpin, is in close proximity to base pairs 2 and 5. Also consistent with the model is disruption of binding by mutation of Glu-39 and Glu-40, which are predicted to lie at the interface of the two overlapping Mad MH1 domains. As predicted from the overlapping model, binding is disrupted by insertion of 1 bp in the middle of the site, whereas insertion of 2 bp creates abutting sites that can be bound by the Mad-Medea heterotrimer without requiring Glu-39 and Glu-40. Overlapping Mad sites predominate in decapentaplegic response elements, consistent with a high degree of specificity in response to signaling.

Considerable progress has been made in understanding how Smad proteins interact with cofactors to activate or repress transcription, and it is expected that response thresholds will be determined by their combined affinities for particular cis elements. In Drosophila this is complicated by a double-negative mechanism, in which Dpp represses the brinker (brk) gene, and the Brk protein then represses other Dpp targets, in some instances by competing for Mad-binding sites (21Marty T.

Repression of brk by Dpp is through a small silencer element (brkS) that contains a high affinity Mad-Medea-binding site (30Muller B. Hartmann B. Pyrowolakis G. Affolter M. Basler K.

A nearly identical silencer controls repression of bag of marbles (bam) in germ line stem cells in response to Dpp secreted from an adjacent somatic layer of the ovary or testis (32Chen D.H.

Alignment of these sites and mutational analysis revealed that these silencers are bipartite, with a GRCGNC Mad-binding site spaced 5 bp from a GTCT Medea-binding site (30Muller B. Hartmann B.

Once bound, Mad and Med together recruit Schnurri, a large zinc finger transcription factor with a repression domain responsible for silencing of brk and bam (31Pyrowolakis G. Hartmann B. Muller B. Basler K. Affolter M. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Smad proteins contact DNA with a β-hairpin contained in the MH1 domain. β-Hairpin side chains make specific major groove contact with bases at the 1st, 3rd, and 4th positions of GTCT (34Shi Y. Wang Y. Jayaraman L. Haijuan Y. Massague J. Pavletich N. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), and each of these amino acids is required in both Mad and Medea for silencer binding (35Gao S. Steffen J. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36158-36164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, an analysis of stoichiometry revealed that the GRCGNC site is contacted by two Mad MH1 domains and that all three base-contact residues are required in both subunits (35Gao S. Steffen J. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36158-36164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This then leads to the question of how two Mad MH1 domains can squeeze onto a 6-bp site using the same contacts involved in binding of a single MH1 to a 4-bp site. The silencer GRCGNC Mad-binding site resembles the previously identified GCCGNCG Mad consensus deduced from alignment of Dpp-activated enhancers (16Xu X. Yin Z. Hudson J.B. Ferguson E.L. Frasch M.

Here we provide evidence that two Mad MH1 domains bind to GRCGNC by overlapping across the two central base pairs of the site. Plasmids—Mad, Med, TkvQD, ShnCT, and 2XGFP-Mad/-Med effector plasmids for expression in human 293T cells have been described previously. Site-directed mutagenesis of Mad and Med effector plasmids was carried out using a method described previously (35Gao S. Steffen J. Laughon A. J. Biol.

Plasmid constructs and products of site-directed mutagenesis were verified by DNA sequencing. For reporter assays, the brkS sequence or derivatives were inserted between the EcoRI and NotI sites of 3xSu(H)-HSC (35Gao S. Steffen J. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36158-36164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). pPacTkvQD, pPacSu(H), and pPacNAct have been described previously (28Kirkpatrick H. Johnson K.

Gel Shift and Reporter Assays—Gel shift assays and preparation of DNA probes and lysates from transfected human 293T cells were performed as described previously (35Gao S. Steffen J. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36158-36164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Gel images were collected with a Storm 870 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and the amount of probe present in bands was determined using ImageQuant software. Reporter assays were performed by transfection of Drosophila S2 cells as described previously (35Gao S. Steffen J. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36158-36164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with pPac-luc as an internal control. S2 cells were harvested 2 days after transfection, and chemiluminescent β-galactosidase and luciferase assays were performed on cell extracts using the GalactoStar assay system (Tropix, Inc.) according to the supplier's instructions. Reporter assays were performed in triplicate with results normalized to the internal control. Western blotting was performed as described previously (35Gao S. Steffen J. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36158-36164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling—The Swiss-Model feature of Deep View (46Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9396) Google Scholar) was used to thread amino acids 26-146 of the Mad MH1 domain sequence onto the Smad3 MH1-DNA co-crystal structure of Chai et al. (47Chai J. Wu J.W. Yan N. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20327-20331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Compared with Smad3, Mad has a 3-residue gap in loop L1 between helices H1 and H2, as do the homologous BMP rSmads. By using the alignment feature, this gap was manually positioned between Lys-35 and Gln-36, allowing the Mad sequence to thread along the complete lengths of helices H2 and H3. Manual alignment was also used to position a single residue gap between Smad3 Lys-44 and Thr-45 in the turn between helices H2 and H3. The threaded alignment was submitted as a modeling request to the Swiss Model server. The resulting improved Mad MH1 domain model was manually docked to a B-DNA model of the brkS element generated using the model.it program of the DNAtools website (48Vlahovicek V. Kajan L. Pongor S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3686-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The Mutate feature of DeepView/Swiss-Pdb-Viewer (46Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9396) Google Scholar) was used to explore possible hydrogen bonding between side chains at the interface between the two Mad MH1 domains. The same homology modeling and docking procedures were used to generate the Medea MH1 domain model shown in Fig. 5A. The images shown in Fig. 5 were generated by POV-Ray version 3.5 from screens created using DeepView. Binding of Two Mad MH1 Domains to a 6-bp Site Suggests an Overlapping Model for DNA Contact—Alignment and mutational analysis of the bam and brk silencer elements identified a Mad-binding site spanning 6 bp but in which only 4 positions are rigidly specified (31Pyrowolakis G. Hartmann B. Muller B. Basler K. Affolter M. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 35Gao S. Steffen J. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36158-36164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These Mad sites are contacted by two Mad MH1 domains, each involving all three canonical β-hairpin contact residues. In Mad these base-contact amino acids are Arg-88, Gln-90, and Lys-95 (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows three models for how two Mad MH1 domains might contact GRCGNC. In each model, Arg-88 and Lys-95 contact guanines spaced 2 bases apart on opposite strands, as they do in the Smad3MH1-DNA structure. In the first model, the two MH1 domains abut facing outward so that 1 additional base on each end of the site (positions -1 and 7) would be contacted by Gln-90, a side chain that has been shown to be critical for binding of Mad to brkS (35Gao S. Steffen J. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36158-36164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Pyrowolakis et al. (31Pyrowolakis G. Hartmann B. Muller B. Basler K. Affolter M. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) showed that substitution of G at -1 or C at +7 had little effect on binding of the Mad-Medea complex, inconsistent with critical base-specific contact at either position. However, contact by Gln-90 might be compatible with more than 1 base, which appears to be the case for the corresponding Gln-111 of Medea, because either T or G is tolerated at the 4th position of its binding site in brkS (i.e. GTCT or GTCG) (31Pyrowolakis G. Hartmann B. Muller B. Basler K. Affolter M. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 35Gao S. Steffen J. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36158-36164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To explore this further, we measured the effects of all possible single base substitutions of the flanking base pairs using a competitive gel shift assay (Fig. 1C). In this experiment excess unlabeled wild-type and mutant brkS DNAs were added to gel shift binding reactions containing labeled wild-type brkS probe. The observed effects on binding to brkS were minor, as judged by comparison of 3-fold steps in the concentration of cold competitor DNAs. Furthermore, according to model 1, -1A and 7T would be expected to improve binding because they match the Smad box consensus, but instead diminished binding affinity. Thus, these results do not lend support for model 1. For the same reasons, the results also weigh against a second model in which the MH1 domains bind pointed in the same direction with 1 bp of overlap, such that the predictions would apply to one flanking side or the other. The results do not rule out a third model in which the two Mad MH1 domains point toward each other with their β-hairpins overlapping across the two central base pairs in the major groove (Fig. 1B, model 3). According to this model, all base contact by β-hairpin side chains occurs within the 6-bp site, and the observed minor effects of substitutions at flanking positions would be indirect (e.g. perhaps reflecting constraints on DNA conformation). Consistent with this model, we note that the symmetry of -1T and 7A matches the conserved T adjacent to the Medea-binding site of brkS or bamS (TGTCT). Silencer Binding Is Sensitive to Mutations Affecting the Tip of the Mad β-Hairpin—To further distinguish between the Mad-binding site models, we sought a way of determining how the β-hairpins of the two Mad subunits are positioned with relation to specific base pairs within the brkS-binding site. At the tip of the β-hairpin, where it makes the turn between β-sheets B2 and B3, rSmads contain a histidine residue (His-93 in Mad) whose imidazole side chain is pointed toward the neighboring MH1 domain in the Smad3-DNA structure (34Shi Y. Wang Y. Jayaraman L. Haijuan Y. Massague J. Pavletich N. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 47Chai J. Wu J.W. Yan N. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20327-20331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The overlapping model for binding of Mad MH1 domains to brkS positions His-93 near the DNA-contacting Arg-88 side chain of the opposite Mad subunit (Fig. 2A). The predicted close proximity of these residues suggests that binding might be affected by substitution of a bulky residue in place of His-93. To test this a H93W mutation (MadH93W) was made and found to cause substantial reduction in binding affinity for brkS (Fig. 2B). By co-expressing MadH93W together with 2XGFP-Mad, it was found that complexes in which just one Mad subunit contains the H93W mutation were relatively unaffected compared with wild type (Fig. 2C). The corresponding position in Medea and Smad4 is a glycine instead of histidine (Gly-114 in Medea), and it was found that a MedeaG114W mutation had a weaker effect on silencer binding (Fig. 2B), consistent with the binding of Medea to the unpaired GTCT and indicating that a Trp substitution at this position in the β-hairpin does not drastically interfere with DNA contact if the site is nonoverlapping. In separate experiments it was noticed that substitutions at position 2 or position 5 of the overlapping site caused reductions in binding affinity (Fig. 2D). Position 2 shows a bias for G and position 5 shows the same bias on the opposite strand, consistent with a completely symmetrical Mad-binding site of optimal sequence GGCGCC. In the overlapping model, bases at positions 2 and 5 are not predicted to make direct contact with the MH1 domains but are near the His-93 side chain. To test whether an unfavorable interaction with His-93 might be responsible for the reduced binding affinity, MadH93A was tested for binding to brkS, whose Mad site sequence is GGCGAC, and to the position 2 and 5 mutations, GCCGAC and GGCGGC (Fig. 2E, numbering as in Fig. 1B). The MadH93A mutation had little or no effect on binding to the GGCGAC site or to the optimal GGCGCC but enhanced binding to the 2C and 5G probes, consistent with proximity of these 2 bases to the corresponding His-93 side chains. Western blot analysis showed that neither H93A nor H93W detectably affected the level of Mad protein in the cell lysates used for gel shift experiments (Fig. 2, B and E, lower panels). These results support an overlapping model in which the tip of the β-hairpin of one Mad subunit is close to position 2 and on the other subunit is close to position 5. The brkS Mad Site Is Disrupted by Interrupting Symmetry in the Proposed Overlap—The overlapping model predicts that a 1-bp insertion at the center of the GGCGAC site will disrupt overlap of the two sites, creating an asymmetric 1-bp overlap or two tandem sites (Fig. 3A). A varying degree of disruption by such insertions was observed (Fig. 3B), the least damaging of which (the 3(A)4 construct) correlated with the creation of a GTCT site. In contrast, a series of 2-bp insertions left binding largely intact (3(GC)4, 3(TA)4, and 2SB_RL probes in Fig. 3C), whereas further separation of the sites reduced binding affinity (Fig. 3C, right 4 lanes) suggesting that proximity of the Mad MH1 domains is required for stable binding. These effects were confirmed in a competitive gel shift assay (Fig. 3D). Binding was also disrupted when the GGCGAC Mad-binding site was replaced with other arrangements of two SBEs (2SB_LR, 2SB_LL, and 2SB_RR probes in Fig. 3E), indicating that stability of the bound Mad-Medea complex depends upon a specific topology of the Mad MH1 domains. The failure to disrupt binding by 2-bp insertions might be due to the creation of two abutting sites in the same configuration as the Smad3/Smad4 consensus binding site (49Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S.B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar), (indicated by the arrows marking each sequence in Fig. 3A). In support of this idea, binding was not disrupted by substitution of GTCTAGAC (the Smad3/4 consensus) in place of GGCGAC; rather, slight enhancement of binding was observed (Fig. 3, C and D, 2SB_RL). The resulting gel shift complex had a slightly slower mobility than the brkS complex and was still dependent on the Medea site for high affinity binding (Fig. 3F, compare brkS, 3(TA)4, and 2SB_RL to corresponding GTCTm probes). Stoichiometry of the complex was assessed using 2xGFP fusions to Mad or Medea (Fig. 3G). The substitution of 2xGFP-Mad for Mad caused a supershift consistent with the presence of two Mad subunits (35Gao S. Steffen J. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36158-36164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and an intermediate band was visible when Mad and 2xGFP-Mad were both present in the complex. In contrast, the supershifted 2xGFP-Medea aligns with the immediate Mad+2xGFPMad band and caused no obvious intermediate band in combination with Medea, consistent with the presence of just a single Medea subunit. Together, these results indicate a 2:1 Mad:Medea heterotrimer complex, as was found for the brkS Mad-Medea complex (35Gao S. Steffen J. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36158-36164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Reporter assays were carried out in Drosophila S2 cells to determine whether an abutting site still allows silencer function. In this assay the brkS and bamSE silencers can over-ride reporter activation by Notch and Suppressor Hairless (30Muller B. Hartmann B. Pyrowolakis G. Affolter M. Basler K. Cell. 2003; 113: 221-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31Pyrowolakis G. Hartmann B. Muller B. Basler K. Affolter M. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 35Gao S. Steffen J. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36158-36164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). By using this assay, we found that when abutting Mad-binding sites matched the GC-rich Mad consensus, i.e. GGCGCGCC, then ShnCT still bound (2GC_RL probe in Fig. 3H) and the element repressed reporter expression in response to Dpp signaling (2GC_RL reporter in Fig. 3I). If the abutting site was changed to GTCTAGAC, then ShnCT bound was reduced (2SB_RL probe in Fig. 3H), and repression was lost (Fig. 3I), perhaps reflecting a situation where, in vivo, the binding of co-activators wins out when Shn binding affinity drops below a critical threshold, despite its ability to bind weakly in vitro. Repression was also disrupted when the overlapping Mad sites were replaced with other arrangements of two SBEs (Fig. 3I). The results described above show that Mad binds to GTCT or GGCG with similar affinity despite a difference in the base apparently contacted by Mad Gln-90. In the overlapping site the sequence is constrained to GNCGNC, but in abutting sites it seemed possible that GTCT and GGCG might be interchangeable. However, although the 2SB_RL and 2GC_RL probes were bound with similar affinity, a composite of the two, GTCTCGCC, was bound only weakly (GC_SB probe in Fig. 3H). In addition, we tested the alternative Smad1-binding site, GCAT (50Henningfeld K.A. Rastegar S. Adler G. Knochel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21827-21835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and we observed"
